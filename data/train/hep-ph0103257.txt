    "during recent years cern , desy and fnal have been producing interesting results on diffractive production in hadron and deep - inelastic processes @xcite .",
    "discovery of hard diffraction at cern s@xmath1s @xcite and diffractive events in the deep - inelastic scattering at hera @xcite were among the most surprising results obtained recently .",
    "significant fraction of high-@xmath2 events among the diffractive events in deep - inelastic scattering and in hadron - hadron interactions were also observed at hera @xcite and tevatron @xcite respectively .",
    "these experimental findings have renewed interest in the experimental and theoretical studies of the diffractive production processes .",
    "there are many unsolved problems in soft and hard hadronic physics which should be studied at the highest possible energies at the lhc and their importance should not be overshadowed by the expectations for the new particles in this newly opening energy range .",
    "we consider several such problems in some details in this note .",
    "first of all one deals with genuinely * strong interactions , which are not corrections to the free or lowest  order dynamics ( this is the case of purely hard processes where perturbative qcd is able ( with some serious reservations , though ) to make predictions and decriptions ) . in this regime",
    "it is possible that the interaction will enter the new scattering mode ",
    "antishadow scattering which is in principle allowed by unitarity and may be realized in the region of the strong coupling @xcite .",
    "however , it is not necessarily realized in nature and only the experimental studies can provide the crucial answer .",
    "*    it is useful to estimate spatial extension of the diffractive processes . from the heisenberg uncertainty relations one",
    "gets , e. g. for elastic scattering , @xmath3 and at high energies @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are longitudinal and transverse coordinate uncertainties , correspondingly in the c. m. s. , @xmath7 is the total c. m. s. energy . it should be noted that our formulas refer to final state momenta which are stochastic due to fluctuations ( quantum - mechanical ) in the scattering angle and our definition of @xmath8 looks like the following : @xmath9 , @xmath10 and then we take as usual @xmath11 similarly for @xmath12 , but there we know due to azimuthal symmetry that @xmath13 .    in diffractive processes average momentum transfers @xmath14 , @xmath15 depend only weakly on @xmath16 so we will deal with * large distances at lhc . for instance @xmath17 *    at such long distances description of the high  energy collisions in terms of individual partons  quarks and gluons ceases to be adequate .",
    "we enter a new territory where confinement dynamics is overwhelming and some ( gluon ) field configurations become relevant degrees of freedom . in other words",
    "diffractive high  energy scattering deals with undulatory aspects of the qcd dynamics .",
    "this field is one of the greatest challenges to both theoretical and experimental high  energy physics communities .",
    "unitarity of the scattering matrix @xmath18 implies the existence at high energies @xmath19 of the new scattering mode ",
    "antishadow one .",
    "it has been described in some detail ( cf . @xcite and references therein ) and",
    "the most important feature of this mode is the self - damping of the contribution from the inelastic channels .",
    "we argue here that the antishadow scattering mode could be definitely revealed at the lhc energy and provide numerical estimations based on the @xmath20-matrix unitarization method @xcite .    in the impact parameter representation",
    "the unitarity relation written for the elastic scattering amplitude @xmath21 at high energies has the form @xmath22 where the inelastic overlap function @xmath23 is the sum of all inelastic channel contributions .",
    "unitarity equation has two solutions for the case of pure imaginary amplitude : @xmath24.\\label{usol}\\ ] ] eikonal unitarization @xmath25 with pure imaginary eikonal ( @xmath26 ) corresponds to the choice of the one particular solution of the unitarity equation with sign minus .    in the @xmath20matrix approach",
    "the form of the elastic scattering amplitude in the impact parameter representation is the following : @xmath27 @xmath28 is the generalized reaction matrix , which is considered as an input dynamical quantity similar to eikonal function .    inelastic overlap function is connected with @xmath28 by the relation @xmath29    it is worth noting that the shadow scattering mode is considered usually as the only possible one .",
    "but the two solutions of the unitarity equation have an equal meaning and the antishadow scattering mode should not be excluded .    appearance of the antishadow scattering mode is completely consistent with the basic idea that the particle production is the driving force for elastic scattering .",
    "let us consider the transition to the antishadow scattering mode @xcite . with conventional parameterizations of the @xmath20matrix the inelastic overlap function increases with energies at modest values of @xmath16 .",
    "it reaches its maximum value @xmath30 at some energy @xmath31 and beyond this energy the antishadow scattering mode appears at small values of @xmath32 .",
    "the region of energies and impact parameters corresponding to the antishadow scattering mode is determined by the conditions @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the quantitative analysis of the experimental data @xcite gives the threshold value of energy : @xmath35 tev .",
    "this value is confirmed by the recent model considerations @xcite .",
    "thus , the function @xmath23 becomes peripheral when energy is increasing . at such energies the inelastic overlap function reaches its maximum value at @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the interaction radius .",
    "so , beyond the transition threshold there are two regions in impact parameter space : the central region of antishadow scattering at @xmath38 and the peripheral region of shadow scattering at @xmath39 .",
    "the impact parameter dependence of the amplitude @xmath21 and inelastic channel contribution @xmath23 at @xmath19 are represented on fig . 1 .",
    "the region of lhc energies is the one where antishadow scattering mode is to be presented .",
    "this mode can be revealed directly measuring @xmath40 and @xmath41 and not only through the analysis in impact parameter representation .",
    "note that the impact parameter behavior of the amplitude and the inelastic overlap function have the form depicted on the fig . 2 in case when the only shadow scattering is realized at the lhc energies .    for the lhc energy @xmath42",
    "@xmath43 the model based on the @xmath20matrix form of unitariazation provides ( fig .",
    "3 ) @xmath44 and @xmath45 thus , the antishadow scattering mode could be discovered at lhc by measuring @xmath46 ratio which is greater than the black disc value @xmath47 ( fig .",
    "however , the lhc energy is not in the asymptotic region yet , the asymptotical behavior @xmath48 is expected at @xmath49 @xmath43 .",
    "the above predicted values for the global characteristics of @xmath50  interactions at lhc differ from the most common predictions of the other models .",
    "first of all total cross ",
    "section is predicted to be twice as much of the common predictions in the range 95 - 120 mb @xcite and it even overshoots the existing cosmic ray data .",
    "however , extracting proton ",
    "proton cross sections from cosmic ray experiments is model dependent and far from straightforward ( see , e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it should be noted here that the large value of the total cross ",
    "section is due to the elastic scattering while the value of inelastic cross ",
    "section is about 80 mb and close to the common predictions .",
    "therefore , the large value of the total cross  section does not imply the large background .",
    "similarity between elastic and inelastic diffraction in the @xmath2-channel approach suggests that the latter one would have similar to elastic scattering behavior of the differential cross - section .",
    "however , it can not be taken for granted and e.g. transverse momentum distribution of diffractive events in the deep - inelastic scattering at hera shows a power - like behavior without apparent dips @xcite .",
    "similar behavior was observed also in the hadronic diffraction dissociation process at cern @xcite where also no dip and bump structure was observed .",
    "angular dependence of diffraction dissociation together with the measurements of the differential cross  section in elastic scattering would allow to determine the geometrical properties of elastic and inelastic diffraction , their similar and distinctive features and origin .",
    "it is interesting to note that at large values of the missing mass @xmath51 the normalized differential cross - section @xmath52 ( @xmath53 is the value of cross - section at @xmath54 ) will exhibit scaling behavior @xcite @xmath55 and explicit form of the function @xmath56 is the following @xmath57 this dependence is depicted on fig .",
    "the above scaling has been obtained in the model approach , however it might have a more general meaning .",
    "conventional diffractive inelastic scattering predictions on the basis of the triple - reggeon phenomenology do not exhibit @xmath58scaling .    the angular structure of diffraction dissociation processes given by eq .",
    "( [ scal ] ) takes place at high energies where while at moderate and low energies dip  bump structure can be presented @xcite .",
    "thus at low energies the situation is similar to the elastic scattering , i.e. diffraction cone and possible dip - bump structure should be present in the region of small values of @xmath2 and behavior of the differential cross - section will be rather complicated and incorporates diffraction cone , orear type ( exponential behavior with @xmath59 ) and power - like dependencies .    at the lhc energy the diffractive events with the masses as large as 3 tev could be studied",
    ". it would be interesting to check this prediction at the lhc where the scaling and simple power - like behavior of diffraction dissociation differential cross - section should be observed .",
    "observation of such behavior would confirm the diffraction mechanism based on excitation of the complex hadronlike object - constituent quark .",
    "this mechanism can in principle explain angular structure of diffraction in the deep - inelastic scattering at hera where smooth angular dependence on the thrust transverse momentum was observed @xcite . if it is the case , then diffraction in dis at lower energies should manifest typical soft diffractive behavior with exponential peak at small @xmath2 as it does in hadronic reactions .",
    "in principle measurements of the global characteristics , like @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 etc . may be considered as a source of information on the size and shape of the interaction region . to some extent",
    "this can be assimilated to the famous `` inverse scattering problem '' in potential scattering , where the problem is , roughly , to extract an unknown potential from the `` data '' ( phase shifts ) .",
    "this stage of study is , in principle , model independent . only after getting an information on the interaction region",
    "can one ask if , say , qcd is able to describe and explain it .",
    "when generic diffractive processes proceed it may happen that due to vacuum fluctuations some short  time perturbation will take place , resulting in appearing of hard scattered partons which we percept as hadronic jets .",
    "such a perturbation may quite strongly influence the interaction region which can result in a spectacular change of the normal diffractive pattern .    as an example one can consider the process ( fig .",
    "6 ) @xmath64 where two jets are safely separated from `` diffractive '' protons by rapidity gaps .",
    "the study of a change of a diffractive pattern may be realized as a joint on - line measurement by cms ( jets and rapidity gaps ) and totem ( `` diffractive protons '' at roman pots ) @xcite .",
    "the dependence of a symmetric @xmath65 @xmath2distribution at two values of @xmath0 is pictured at fig . 7 .",
    "the squared sub - energies @xmath66 are supposed to be in the asymptotical region .",
    "the studies of soft interactions at the lhc energies can lead to the discoveries of fundamental importance .",
    "the evolution of hadron scattering with rising energy can be described as transition from the grey to black disc and eventually to black ring with the antishadow scattering mode in the center .",
    "it is worth noting that the * appearance of the antishadow scattering mode at the lhc energy implies a somewhat unusual scattering picture . at high energies the proton",
    "should be realized as a loosely bounded composite system and it appears that this system has a high probability to reinstate itself only in the central collisions where all of its parts participate in the coherent interactions .",
    "therefore the central collisions are responsible for elastic processes while the peripheral ones where only few parts of weekly bounded protons are involved result in the production of the secondary particles .",
    "this leads to the peripheral impact parameter profile of the inelastic overlap function . *    we have to emphasize once again that from the space  time point of view high  energy diffractive processes reveal * larger and larger distances and times which is a real * terra incognita `` filled '' with still unknown gluon field configurations evidently responsible for * confinement dynamics . *",
    "* *    there could be envisaged various experimental configurations at the lhc ; e.g. soft diffraction goes well to the interest of the totem experiment , while hard diffractive final states can be measured by cms detector and possible * correlations between the features of the soft and hard diffractive processes can be obtained using combined measurements of totem and cms @xcite . *    99 d. m. jansen , m. albrow and r. brugnera , hep - ph/9905537 .",
