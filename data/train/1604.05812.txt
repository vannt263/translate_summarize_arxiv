    "a useful method for observing and measuring ship wakes is to employ an echo sounder to record the water height over time as a ship passes nearby .",
    "the resulting output signal corresponds to the cross - section of the ship wake taken in the direction of travel @xcite .",
    "the surface elevation at the echo sounder can be visualised as a spectrogram through the use of many short - time discrete fourier transforms . in this paper",
    ", we aim to identify and explain features of spectrograms of ship wakes , concentrating on the differing effects that linearity and nonlinearity have on the wave time - frequency signal .",
    "the study of ship waves has been of great academic interest for over a century @xcite . from a mathematical perspective",
    ", a popular approach is to set up a potential flow model , with the effects of the ship approximated by a steadily moving pressure distribution acting on the surface of the water . by linearising the dynamic and kinematic boundary conditions on the free surface",
    ", one can write down exact solutions for the wave pattern using a fourier transform . in this way , theoretical studies provide insight into how the speed of a ship affects the distinguishing features such as the divergent and transverse waves @xcite and the wake angle @xcite .",
    "similarly , linear water wave theory has been used extensively to approximate the drag force associated with a ship wake @xcite . for the fully nonlinear versions of these problems ,",
    "direct analysis is much more difficult @xcite .",
    "thus , studying the effects of nonlinearity on a ship wake is normally framed as a computational challenge @xcite .    in the real world , analysis of ship wave data is limited due to the difficulty of accurately capturing the surface height outside of a towing tank .",
    "one method of observing ship wakes is with satellite photography @xcite or radar @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , satellite photography requires adequate lighting conditions to highlight the desired wake components @xcite .",
    "even with sufficient clarity , a photograph can not provide quantitative data on the surface elevation , leaving only a few viable measurements to be performed on the ship wake , such as the wake angle @xcite .",
    "radar can be hampered by backscattering that leads to a bright narrow v - pattern @xcite caused by bragg - resonant ship waves @xcite and not related to the wake angles observed by @xcite .",
    "another method of observing ship wakes is to use an echo sounder and to visualise the frequencies via a spectrogram , as mentioned above .",
    "we will focus on spectrograms in this paper .",
    "spectrograms are popular in many fields and , for example , have been used in signal processing for decades @xcite to decompose signals into wave components of different frequency . even though @xcite determined the theoretical recovered wave frequencies for a sensor travelling over a far - field ship wake , spectrograms are a relatively new tool in the study of water waves , originally used by @xcite to analyse ship wakes with a sensor moving perpendicular to the direction of the ship .",
    "the work of @xcite was closely followed by @xcite who performed experiments with a stationary sensor and constructed low resolution spectrograms using experimental data .",
    "there has been a resurgence of interest in the use of spectrograms for analysing ship waves @xcite , for which a stationary sensor is used to measure the wake of ships . for much of this recent work",
    ", the primary focus of the research has been on calculating the energy contained in a given wake and the effect that the propagating wake wash will have when it interacts with the coastal zone @xcite .",
    "this work is important because regulators need to balance the protection of the coastal environment ( both natural and built ) against the need for efficient shipping systems .    by applying linear water wave theory",
    ", @xcite showed that for small amplitude waves , the spectrogram of a steadily moving vessel has two linear components : a sliding - frequency mode ( chirp ) and a constant - frequency mode corresponding to divergent and transverse waves , respectively .",
    "the transverse and divergent components of the spectrogram were used to predict the ship s speed and the minimum distance from the echo sounder .",
    "however , by analysing high speed ferry data from the gulf of finland , @xcite found and classified five wake components present in the spectrogram , the two linear components just mentioned plus three more ; they referred to the additional three components as precursor solitary , leading and low frequency waves ( figure [ fig : torsvikspec ] ) .",
    "@xcite were able offer some evidence to the notion that two of the additional wake components ( the so - called precursor and leading waves ) were a result of wave shoaling and nonlinear effects caused by the ship waves approaching the shore .",
    "@xcite offered their own explanations for the features of the experimental spectrogram in figure [ fig : torsvikspec ] .",
    "they agree with @xcite with respect to the cause of the precursor solitary wave and the leading wave being attributed to the nonlinear effects of the ship hull and wave shoaling .",
    "however , @xcite attributed the two branches of colour intensity in the transverse wave component ( in the boxed labelled tw in figure  [ fig : torsvikspec ] ) to the transverse and divergent waves , stating that the transverse wave component represents the entire kelvin wake signal .",
    "finally , @xcite did not provide an explanation for the features in the divergent and low frequency wave components .",
    "the motivation for the present study is to use theoretical and computational methods to identify linear and nonlinear features of idealised spectrograms and to better understand the origin of the wake components in experimental spectrograms such as those presented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "whereas they use @xmath0 .",
    "the five wake components as identified by @xcite are the precursor solitary ( pw ) , leading ( lw ) , divergent ( dw ) , transverse ( tw ) and low frequency ( lf ) waves .",
    "the wave signal is presented above the spectrogram . ]",
    "we begin by taking spectrograms of linear free - surface profiles to identify the two wake components that are present for linear flows past a pressure distribution ( namely , the sliding - frequency mode and the constant - frequency mode ) . a geometric argument",
    "is provided to show that these components are present for all linear ship wave patterns .",
    "an advantage of using the idealised problem of flow past a pressure distribution ( as opposed to flow past a single point pressure , as used by @xcite ) , is that we are able to demonstrate how the high intensity signal in the spectrogram follows the constant - frequency mode ( sliding - frequency mode ) for slower ( faster ) ships .",
    "we then modify the numerical method for computing nonlinear ship waves by @xcite to significantly increase the domain size of the computed solution .",
    "we use the numerical solutions to generate accurate spectrograms of nonlinear ship waves ; these spectrograms are free of wind waves that are present in experimental measurements , allowing us to more easily observe the effects of steep nonlinear waves .",
    "we identify features present in nonlinear spectrograms and use a weakly nonlinear theory to derive analytical results that match well with the numerical simulations . while it is very difficult to separate the direct influence of the high speed ferry in the spectrogram in figure  [ fig : torsvikspec ] from other effects or artifacts that may be unrelated to that particular vessel , we propose that nonlinear waves may be associated with the leading wave component recorded by @xcite .",
    "finally , we see the transverse wave component in figure  [ fig : torsvikspec ] is not horizontal , as predicted by linear theory .",
    "we provide a possible explanation for this discrepancy by accounting for ship acceleration in the linear model .",
    "in order to simulate a wake left behind a moving ship , we consider the idealised problem of calculating the free surface disturbance created by a steadily moving pressure distribution applied to the surface of an infinitely deep body of water . we suppose the pressure distribution is of a gaussian type with strength @xmath1 and characteristic length @xmath2 , and then formulate the mathematical problem in the reference frame of this moving pressure .",
    "we nondimensionalise the problem by scaling all velocities by the speed of the pressure distribution , @xmath3 , and all lengths by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is acceleration due to gravity .",
    "the governing equations are then @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the velocity potential , @xmath8 is the free - surface height , @xmath9 is the dimensionless pressure strength , @xmath10 is the fluid density and @xmath11 is the pressure distribution . for the present study we will use the pressure distribution @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the froude number . in this formulation , @xmath14 is the parameter that measures the speed of the moving pressure , while the pressure strength @xmath15 provides a measure of nonlinearity in the problem ( the regime @xmath16 is approximately linear ) . note that in computing the bernoulli constant on the right - hand side of ( [ eq : bern ] ) , we have assumed the surface height @xmath17 far upstream as @xmath18 .    the use of ( [ eq : pressure ] ) to represent a ship is obviously extremely simplistic .",
    "other simple models include a pair of pressure distributions , one positive and one negative to represent the bow and stern waves of a ship @xcite , a thin - ship approximation for when the beam of the ship is much less than the length @xcite or a flat - ship approximation for when the draft is much less than the length @xcite .",
    "however , as a first step , we have found the use of ( [ eq : pressure ] ) particularly insightful as the disturbance has a well defined centre point to aid our geometrical arguments .",
    "additionally , gaussian pressure distributions are still frequently used to approximate the ship when analysing properties of the wake @xcite .",
    "for weak pressure distributions , @xmath16 , the problem ( [ eq : laplace])-([eq : pressure ] ) can be linearised .",
    "the linearised version has the exact solution @xcite @xmath19)}{k - k_0}\\,\\,\\mathrm{d}k\\,\\,\\mathrm{d}\\psi\\notag\\\\ & -\\frac{\\epsilon h(x)}{\\pi } \\int\\limits_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2}k_0 ^ 2\\tilde{p}(k_0,\\psi)\\sin(k_0[x\\cos\\psi+y\\sin\\psi])\\,\\,\\mathrm{d}\\psi,\\label{eq : exactlinearinfinite}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the fourier transform of the pressure distribution ( [ eq : pressure ] ) , @xmath21 is the heaviside function and the path of integration over @xmath22 is taken below the pole @xmath23 , where @xmath24 ( thus this integral can be interpreted as a cauchy principal value integral plus half of the residue at @xmath23 ) .",
    "a spectrogram of a ship wake is generated by first taking a cross - section of the wave surface at a constant value of @xmath25 to create a wave signal , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 by changing the reference frame to move with the uniform flow ( recall the dimensionless speed is unity ) .",
    "the spectrogram data is then given by the square magnitude of a short - time fourier transform : @xmath28 where the window function , @xmath29 , is an even function with compact support . in this paper",
    "we will use the blackman - harris 92db window function @xcite .",
    "the results are placed in a time - frequency heat map of angular frequency @xmath30 against scaled time @xmath31 and colour intensity on a log scale , @xmath32 .",
    "spectrograms computed from the linear solution ( [ eq : exactlinearinfinite ] ) for the froude numbers @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are presented in figure [ fig : linspec ] together with a solid curve which we refer to as the linear dispersion curve . more details are provided in the following subsection , but for now we note the linear dispersion curve has two branches , the lower branch corresponding to the transverse wave component of the spectrogram and the upper branch corresponding to the divergent wave component . in this figure",
    "we have chosen to fix @xmath37 , but note that for sufficiently large @xmath25 ( say @xmath38 ) , the spectrograms appear the same on this scale . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath25 is chosen to be too small ( that is , the sample is too close to the pressure disturbance ) , there will be some unwanted blurring between the two branches in the spectrogram .",
    "there are two key features of the spectrograms in figure [ fig : linspec ] .",
    "first , the high intensity portion of the spectrograms ( the lighter coloured part ) in parts ( a)-(d ) appears to be centred on the linear dispersion curve .",
    "thus , for this problem of linearised flow past a pressure distribution , the linear dispersion curve provides an excellent prediction for the dominant wave signals propagating past a representative point in space .",
    "the second key feature is that the high intensity portion is confined to the lower branch of the dispersion curve for low froude numbers ( approximately @xmath39 ) , while for larger froude numbers it follows the fold and the upper branch .",
    "this result is consistent with observations of ship wave patterns that suggest slowly moving ships give rise to wakes dominated by transverse waves , while fast vessels produce a wave train dominated by divergent waves .",
    "we note that this second feature is not evident if we treat the idealised problem of flow past a point pressure ( as in @xcite ) , since the solution to the point - pressure problem does not depend on any parameter values apart from the pressure strength @xmath15 ( there is no length scale and so no froude number ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     we close this subsection by commenting on the ultimate fate of nonlinear solutions as our parameter @xmath15 increases . from bernoulli s equation ( [ eq : bern ] ) , we see there is an absolute upper bound for the free surface height , @xmath40 . thus , for a given solution , the maximum surface height @xmath41 .",
    "this maximum surface height typically occurs at the crest of one of the divergent waves , although it can also occur on the centreline , depending on the parameter values . as @xmath15 increases , the problem becomes more nonlinear , and we find the maximum surface height @xmath42 also increases .",
    "qualitatively , we observe that for increasing @xmath15 , the waves themselves have sharper crests and broader troughs .",
    "we speculate that ultimately there exists a critical value , @xmath43 , such that @xmath44 as @xmath45 , although our present numerical scheme is not capable of computing solutions that are sufficiently nonlinear to explore this issue in any detail .",
    "we shall now make some comparisons with the experimental spectrogram shown in figure [ fig : torsvikspec ] .",
    "the high speed ferry that produced the wake in question is named the _ star _ , which sails from tallinn , estonia to helsinki , finland .",
    "the reported operating speed of the _ star _ at the time the data was measured was 14.2 ms@xmath46 @xcite .",
    "its length and width are @xmath47 m and @xmath48 m , respectively .",
    "this corresponds to a half - length based froude number of @xmath49 and half - width based froude number of @xmath50 .",
    "obviously , the ferry has an aspect ratio which is much larger than unity .",
    "however , it is still instructive to compare with our mathematical model which assumes an axisymmetric disturbance .    considering the spectrogram in figure [ fig : torsvikspec ]",
    ", we now overlay the linear and second - order dispersion curves in order to compare our theoretical results with experimental data .",
    "to do so we scale the axes based on the speed of the ship , @xmath3 , and the minimum distance to the sensor , @xmath25 , and align the time the ship is closest to the sensor with @xmath51 . as the exact speed , distance and passing time are not known , we match the divergent wave intensity and fold location to the upper branch of the linear dispersion curve , @xmath52 .",
    "the resulting scaled spectrogram is shown in figure  [ fig : torsvikdispcurve ] .",
    "note that in this example we do not consider the transverse wave component @xmath53 when matching between our theoretical and experimental results , because the lower branch of the linear mode in the experimental spectrogram in figure  [ fig : torsvikspec ] does not appear to be horizontal for large @xmath31 , as the theory predicts .",
    "we return to this point in  [ sec : acceleration ] .    by matching the experimental spectrogram",
    "as just described , we find the speed of the ship to be 15.75 ms@xmath46 , the distance from the sensor to be 2.5 km and the time the ship is closest to the sensor to be at 21:18 .",
    "comparing the properties of the ship s voyage with the reported operating speed and the closest distance to the sensor given by @xcite , we see that our calculated speed is a slight over estimation of the reference value , 14.2 ms@xmath46",
    ". this could be due to a number of issues , for example the effects of a steady underlying current or finite depth effects that subtly change the shape of the dispersion curve .",
    "more encouragingly , having a clear divergent wave component means our estimated distance to the sensor falls in the reference bounds of 2.53 km , where 2.5 km corresponds to the outgoing shipping lane .",
    "visually , figure  [ fig : torsvikdispcurve ] shows very good agreement between the dispersion curves and the experimental spectrogram in the time frame of the leading wave .",
    "in particular , for the region near @xmath54 ( roughly @xmath55 ) , the high intensity part of the spectrogram follows the linear dispersion curve ( made up of branches @xmath56 ) and the second - order curves ( with branches @xmath57 ) . this exercise shows how important it is to understand the consequences of steep nonlinear waves when interpreting spectrograms .",
    "it is worth noting that the experimental spectrograms presented by @xcite ( calculated from a tug boat named _ quapaw _ ) show very similar features , including the prominent high intensity regions in the leading wave component .",
    "indeed , @xcite comment that these properties are likely due to nonlinearity .",
    "finally , we note that to the right of the leading wave region of the spectrogram in figure  [ fig : torsvikdispcurve ] ( for roughly @xmath58 ) , there is an obvious disagreement between the experimental results and the lower ( transverse ) branch of the linear dispersion curve , @xmath53 .",
    "we consider this issue further now .    , with the dispersion curves given by ( [ eq : speccurve ] ) , ( [ eq : speccurve2 ] ) and ( [ eq : speccurve3 ] ) overlaid .",
    "the intensity of the spectrogram closely follows the linear and second order dispersion curves @xmath59 within the leading wave component of the spectrogram and follows the divergent wave portion of the linear dispersion curve @xmath52 outside the leading wave .",
    "the transverse wave component of the spectrogram does not appear to follow the lower branch of the linear dispersion curve , @xmath53 , for large @xmath31 . ]",
    "one feature of the experimental spectrogram in figure [ fig : torsvikdispcurve ] that is not yet explained is the obvious difference between the transverse branch of the linear dispersion curve , @xmath53 , and the transverse component of the experimental spectrogram data . in an attempt to explain this discrepancy",
    ", we consider the case that the ship is accelerating from rest up to its cruising speed . we are motivated to explore this approach for two reasons : a ship travelling at a slower speed will generate transverse waves of higher frequency ( from the dispersion relation ) ; and the transverse waves are caused by waves generated earlier than those that generate divergent waves .",
    "we illustrate the second property by referring to figure [ fig : torsvikdispcurveaccel](a ) and ( b ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : torsvikdispcurveaccel](a ) , the solid curve represents a hypothetical ship speed versus time for a @xmath25 value that is fixed to be the closest distance to the sensor .",
    "the actual curve is found by fitting to data , as explained below .",
    "the points a , b and c in the figure are associated with waves that are generated at a time @xmath60 ( figure [ fig : torsvikdispcurveaccel](a ) ) and detected by the sensor at a later time @xmath61 ( figure [ fig : torsvikdispcurveaccel](b ) ) . with this particular velocity profile ,",
    "the wave represented by the point a in figure [ fig : torsvikdispcurveaccel](a)-(b ) , generated at @xmath62 and detected by the sensor at @xmath63 , falls on the transverse branch of the dispersion curve .",
    "the wave represented by the point b is generated later than a , at @xmath64 , but still lies on the transverse branch of the dispersion curve .",
    "it is detected earlier by the sensor , at @xmath65 .",
    "waves generated at later times will eventually lie on the divergent wave branch , such as the wave represented by c. thus , from this argument we see that if the ship is travelling at a slower speed when wave a is generated compared to when wave b is generated , the frequency of the wave a along the dispersion curve will be greater than the frequency of wave b if both waves fall on the transverse branch of the dispersion curve",
    ". therefore , the transverse branch of the linear dispersion curve will grow in frequency as @xmath31 increases if the ship is accelerating .    to determine the location of the linear dispersion curve for an accelerating ship , we first define the nondimensional displacement of the ship , @xmath66 , and its velocity , @xmath67 , with the following properties : @xmath68 here @xmath51 corresponds to the time at which the ship is closest to the sensor .",
    "thus , under these properties , the ship is accelerating during an interval of time before @xmath51 but is moving with constant speed by the time @xmath51 .",
    "the dispersion curve can be defined parametrically in terms of @xmath69 by first determining where the ship generated the wave , @xmath70 , and thus the time the wave was generated , @xmath71 such that @xmath72 . the time taken for the wave to reach the sensor",
    "can then be calculated by @xmath73 where the group velocity @xmath74 .",
    "finally , the variable speed version of equations ( [ eq : kfunc ] ) and ( [ eq : omegafunc ] ) given by @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively , are used to derive the dispersion curve @xmath77      the specific velocity function @xmath67 will affect the shape of the new dispersion curve ( [ eq : speccurvevarspeed ] ) , thus in order to match with the experimental spectrogram ( figure [ fig : torsvikspec ] ) we require a rough approximation for the velocity of the ship observed in the experiment .",
    "we used the shipping traffic website run by the organisation marinetraffic ( marinetraffic.com ) to track the velocity of the _ star _ on a particular day as it left port at tallinn and travelled to the point closest to the sensor ( the location of the sensor is given by @xcite ) .",
    "the data we obtained is nondimensionalised by scaling the velocity by the cruising speed , @xmath78 , and by scaling time by @xmath79 .",
    "time is shifted so that @xmath51 corresponds to when the ship was closest to the sensor .",
    "an example of the data ( for a day in february 2016 ) is given as the squares in figure [ fig : torsvikdispcurveaccel](a ) .",
    "it appears the ferry initially accelerates as it leaves port then slows down as it turns onto its sailing line before finally accelerating up to its cruising speed . for this specific dataset @xmath80",
    "considering only the final acceleration phase , the velocity data for this particular ship looks roughly like an error function , thus we represent it by @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are parameters that are determined by roughly fitting to the data . the velocity profile ( [ eq : velocity ] ) with these parameters is the solid curve in figure [ fig : torsvikdispcurveaccel](a ) .",
    "figure [ fig : torsvikdispcurveaccel](b ) shows a comparison between the new linear dispersion curve ( [ eq : speccurvevarspeed ] ) with @xmath67 given by ( [ eq : velocity ] ) for an accelerating ship ( solid line ) and the constant - speed linear dispersion curve ( @xmath56 , dashed ) .",
    "the transverse branch of the dispersion curve for the accelerating ship clearly increases in frequency as @xmath31 increases ; conversely , the divergent branch is very close to the constant - speed dispersion branch .",
    "the second - order dispersion curves for the accelerating ship have been derived using the method in  [ sec : nonlinear ] , and the full set of dispersion curves has been overlaid onto the experimental spectrogram in figure  [ fig : torsvikdispcurveaccel](c ) , with the same axis - scaling as figure  [ fig : torsvikdispcurve ] .",
    "we see that the new linear dispersion curve does a much better job of predicting the transverse wave in the spectrogram .",
    "of course the fitting process used here is very rough , but our goal is only to suggest a reasonable approximation of the velocity @xmath67 on a given day ( the data for the ferry observed in 2008 is no longer freely available ) . given the clear improvement in the comparison between the measured spectrogram and the theoretical prediction , we are confident that the increase in frequency in the measured transverse wave is due to the observed ship accelerating before passing by the sensor ( and not due to nonlinearity , say ) .",
    "we acknowledge that other explanations are possible , for example shoaling or other finite - depth effects such as wave refraction . or perhaps another explanation entirely .",
    "the use of spectrograms to analyse ship wakes has been explored recently in a number of studies @xcite .",
    "a key observation is that real - world spectrograms appear to highlight components of the wave signal that are in addition to the linear components associated with the traditional transverse and divergent wave systems .",
    "determining the cause of these additional components has provided the motivation for the present study .    through the use of classical linear water wave theory and numerical simulations of nonlinear free - surface flow past a pressure distribution ,",
    "we have identified both linear and higher - order modes present in the spectrograms . as expected",
    ", the high intensity signal in the spectrogram for the linearised problem of flow past a pressure distribution follows the linear dispersion curve ( [ eq : speccurve ] ) . by applying the analogy to flow past a ship",
    ", we have demonstrated that for slowly moving ships , the high intensity portion of the spectrogram lies on top of the transverse branch of the dispersion curve @xmath53 ( also referred to as the constant - frequency mode ) , while for faster ships , the dominant part of the spectrogram lies on top of the divergent branch @xmath52 ( the sliding - frequency mode ) .",
    "we have applied a weakly nonlinear theory to calculate the location of second - order modes @xmath57 ( see ( [ eq : speccurve2])-([eq : speccurve3 ] ) ) ; these do an excellent job of predicting high intensity regions in the spectrogram for a fully nonlinear numerical solutions .",
    "this approach has allowed us to derive a quantitative description of the modes in the so - called leading wave component identified by @xcite , including the parts that are due entirely to steep nonlinear waves , without the need to include finite - depth effects in our modelling . finally , we showed that the frequency increase in the measured transverse waves component of an experimental spectrogram is possibly due to the ship accelerating before passing by the sensor ( and not due to nonlinearity ) .",
    "we are not in a position to provide an explanation for the cause of the so - called precursor solitary wave in in the spectrogram in figure  [ fig : torsvikspec ] , nor have we explained the existence of the two lines of intensity that appear to meet on @xmath52 at @xmath84 and @xmath85 in the same figure .",
    "there are many effects that could potentially be the cause of these additional features .",
    "for example , the precursor solitary wave could be due to `` precursor solitons '' that are generated by vessels moving in shallow water @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the two lines of intensity could be due to other slower vessels , either further away or closer to the sensor , or perhaps even a single accelerating vessel closer to the sensor .",
    "the analytical results for the linear ( [ eq : speccurve ] ) and second - order dispersion curves ( [ eq : speccurve2])([eq : speccurve3 ] ) will hold for any problem in infinite depth for which the ship can be well approximated by a single disturbance .",
    "these results could be easily extended to flows of constant finite depth by changing the dispersion relation , phase velocity and group velocity used in equations ( [ eq : phasevel])([eq : thetazero ] ) .",
    "the approach can also be extended to ` ships ' characterised by two disturbances ( representing bow and stern waves ) by including a second time shifted linear dispersion curve , and by considering up to four distinct waves ( transverse and divergent waves from both disturbances ) in the second order - approximation ( [ eq : secorder ] ) .",
    "such an adjustment in the theory could be relevant for long thin ships @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that if the time shift between the two disturbances is sufficiently small , it will be difficult to differentiate between the two linear dispersion curves and , instead , the interference effects will be captured in the variation of the colour intensity .",
    "our work provides a deeper insight into the signature left behind in the wakes of ships .",
    "this work is important because spectrogram analysis in the real world is only useful if users understand how to identify the key features of a time - frequency heat map and relate them to physical properties of the moving vessel . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "an application of this work is to interpret data from an echo sounder placed in a shipping channel , with the goal of measuring the wave energy emitted by various vessels .",
    "this information is important for monitoring damage to the coast , docked vessels or man - made structures .",
