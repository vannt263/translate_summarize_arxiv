    "supersymmetry has attracted physicists for several decades since it was proposed in 1970s@xcite .",
    "as it is well - known that symmetry has played an important role in particle physics , and three of the four basic forces in nature are governed by gauge symmetries and have successfully been described by quantum field theory . while quantum field theories are bothered by the infinities which must be regularized to be well - defined . on the other hand , whether the symmetries of classical lagrangian still hold in the quantum level remains an important issue , this is because some times it is difficult to distinguish between a real anomaly and an apparent violation of the symmetries due to the use of a symmetry - violating regularization method . in general ,",
    "when a symmetry of original lagrangian is still a symmetry of a full quantum effective action , such a symmetry is regarded to be preserved in the quantum level , but there are several exceptions such as chiral anomaly .",
    "thus one may ask whether supersymmetry is a symmetry of the full quantum theory .",
    "this question has been studied in a regularization - independent way in ref.@xcite , and the answer is yes .",
    "this means when investigating the quantum effects of the supersymmetric theories , one must adopt a supersymmetry - preserving regularization method .",
    "several regularization methods have been applied to supersymmetric theories , such as dimensional reduction(dred)@xcite , differential regularization@xcite and the so - called implicit regularization@xcite , among them dred is the most common one .",
    "it has been shown that dred can preserve supersymmetry in several models@xcite .",
    "strictly speaking , dred is mathematically inconsistent@xcite to be applied to the supersymmetric theories , which is similar to the case when it is applied to the chiral theories , this is because both supersymmetry and the definition of @xmath0 require an exact dimension .",
    "a consistent regularization method that can be applied to all possible cases in quantum field theories is needed . in this sense , the recently developed loop regularization(lr ) with string - mode regulators@xcite may deserve a special attention , it has successfully been applied to the calculations of triangle anomaly of qed with clarifying the possible ambiguities caused by @xmath0@xcite , the evaluation of a consistent coefficient of the cpt and lorentz symmetry breaking chern - simons term@xcite , the computation of all the one - loop renormalization constants for the non - abelian gauge theory and the determination for the coefficient of qcd @xmath1 function@xcite , and the derivation of the chiral effective field theory with a dynamically generated spontaneous symmetry breaking@xcite .",
    "the key concept of this new regularization method is the introduction of the irreducible loop integrals(ilis ) which are evaluated from feynman integrals by using feynman parameter method .",
    "it has been shown that the lr method can preserve the non - abelian gauge symmetry , and meanwhile maintain the divergent behavior of original field theories .",
    "in particular , the lr method is realized in the original four dimensional space - time with translational and lorentz invariance even if two intrinsic mass scales are introduced , thus it can balance the bosonic and fermionic degrees automatically and there is also no ambiguity about the definition of @xmath0 .",
    "it is then believed that this method will preserve supersymmetry as well . in this paper",
    ", we will investigate the applicability of lr method in supersymmetric theories .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we briefly introduce the symmetry - preserving loop regularization with string - mode regulators . in sections [ masslesswz ] and [ massivewz ] , we will verify the supersymmetric ward identities for the massless wess - zumino model and massive wess - zumino model@xcite separately and show that the lr method indeed respects the ward identities .",
    "as ward identity is the reflection of symmetry in quantum level , we then arrive at the conclusion that the lr method is also a supersymmetry - preserving regularization for supersymmetric models . in section [ susygauge ]",
    ", we consider the super yang - mills theory as the testing ground to explicitly demonstrate the supersymmetric ward identity and show that the lr method does preserve supersymmetry , and meanwhile the gauge symmetry is maintained only requiring the consistency condition for logarithmic divergences .",
    "note that the conventional dimensional regularization was shown to break the ward identity in such a model@xcite , thus an alternative check by using lr method in our present paper is nontrivial .",
    "in particular , we will demonstrate that as long as the dirac algebra for @xmath2 matrices are carried out in four dimensional space - time , and the shift of integration variable can be safely made , the supersymmetric ward identities are preserved , which is actually independent of any concrete prescription of regularization methods .",
    "namely , as long as the regularization scheme is realized in four dimensional space - time with translational invariance for momentum integrals , like the lr method , it then preserves supersymmetry . in section",
    "[ case ] , as an explicit demonstration , we will carry out the one - loop renormalization for the massive wess - zumino model by using the lr method , and all the obtained results agree with the well - known non - renormalization theorem .",
    "our conclusions and remarks are given in the last section .",
    "the detailed derivation of majorana feynman rules is presented in the appendix .",
    "it has been shown in@xcite that all one loop feynman integrals can be evaluated into the following 1-fold ilis by using the feynman parameterization method : @xmath3 with @xmath4 and @xmath5 corresponding to the quadratic and logarithmic divergent integrals . where the effective mass factor @xmath6 is a function of the external momenta @xmath7 , the masses of particles @xmath8 and the feynman parameters .",
    "in general , the loop momentum independent @xmath6 can be extended to include linear term in @xmath9 , which can be understood as a part of the definition of the ilis in the lr .",
    "the reason is as follows : let @xmath10 has the following general form including linear term in @xmath9 @xmath11 with @xmath12 an arbitrary parameter . then @xmath13 with @xmath14 which becomes independent of @xmath9 , and @xmath15 via translational invariance .",
    "again the only thing must be paid attention is that one must follow the definition of ilis to cancel out the @xmath16 in the numerator before regularization .    when the regularized 1-fold ilis satisfy the following consistency conditions@xcite : @xmath17 the resulting loop corrections are gauge invariant . here",
    "the superscript `` r '' denotes the regularized ilis .",
    "note that the introduction on the concept of irreducible loop integrals ( ilis ) is crucial in the loop regularization@xcite , where it has been shown that all feynman loop integrals can be evaluated to be expressed by the ilis . from the definition of ilis ,",
    "one of the important properties is that there should be no @xmath16 in the numerator of loop integration , all the ilis can be classified into the scalar type ilis with the following loop integration    @xmath18 and the tensor type ilis with the following loop integration    @xmath19    in evaluating the feynman loop integrals into ilis , one should always perform the dirac algebra and lorentz index - contraction firstly to obtain the ilis defined by the above `` simplest '' forms for the one loop case ( for two loop and higher loop case , see ref.[11 ] ) . therefore , for the integration    @xmath20 which should not be written as    @xmath21 but it must be expressed as    @xmath22 then rewriting the @xmath16 in the numerator into @xmath23 so as to cancel out the first term by the denominator . thus the above feynman loop integration is regarded to be evaluated into the ilis and is given by the following form before regularization    @xmath24    from the above illustration , it is seen that in the spirit of  irreducible loop integrals \" ( ilis ) , the integration    @xmath20 is not an ili , one should not regularize such a loop integration in the loop regularization method .",
    "a simple regularization prescription for the ilis was realized to yield the above consistency conditions , its procedure is that : rotating to the four dimensional euclidean space of momentum , replacing the loop integrating variable @xmath16 and the loop integrating measure @xmath25 in the ilis by the corresponding regularized ones @xmath26_l$ ] and @xmath27_l$ ] : @xmath28_l \\equiv k^2+m^2_l\\ , \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\int{d^4k } \\rightarrow \\int[d^4k]_l \\equiv \\lim_{n , m_l^2}\\sum_{l=0}^{n}c_l^n\\int{d^4k}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) may be regarded as the regulator masses for the ilis .",
    "the regularized ilis in the euclidean space - time are then given by : @xmath31 where the coefficients @xmath32 are chosen to satisfy the following conditions : @xmath33 with the notation @xmath34 denoting the limit @xmath35 .",
    "one may take the initial conditions @xmath36 and @xmath37 to recover the original integrals in the limit @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "such a new regularization is called as loop regularization ( lr ) @xcite .",
    "the prescription in lr method is very similar to pauli - villars prescription , but two concepts are totally different as the prescription in the loop regularization is acting on the ilis rather than on the propagators in pauli - villars scheme .",
    "this is why the pauli - villars regularization violates non - abelian gauge symmetry , while lr method can preserve non - abelian gauge symmetry .    as the simplest solution of eq .",
    "( [ cl conditions ] ) , taking the string - mode regulators @xmath40 with @xmath39 , the coefficients @xmath32 are completely determined @xmath41 here @xmath42 may be regarded as a basic mass scale of loop regulator .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the above regularization prescription can be understood in terms of schwinger proper time formulation with an appropriate regulating distribution function .    with the string - mode regulators for @xmath29 and @xmath32 in above equations ,",
    "the regularized ilis @xmath43 and @xmath44 can be evaluated to the following explicit forms@xcite : @xmath45\\ }   \\nonumber \\\\",
    "i_0^r&=&\\frac{i}{16\\pi^2}[ln\\frac{m_c^2}{\\mu^2}-\\gamma_w+y_0(\\frac{\\mu^2}{m_c^2})]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath46 , and @xmath47 \\ } = \\gamma_e=0.5772\\cdots , \\nonumber \\\\ & & y_0(x)=\\int_0^x d\\sigma \\frac{1-e^{-\\sigma}}{\\sigma } ,   \\quad   y_1(x)=\\frac{e^{-x}-1+x}{x}\\nonumber \\\\ & & y_2(x)=y_0(x)-y_1(x),\\quad \\lim_{x\\rightarrow0}y_i(x)\\rightarrow 0,\\ i=0,1,2 \\\\ & & m_c^2\\equiv \\lim_{n , m_r } m_r^2 \\sum_{l=1}^{n}c_l^n(l \\ln l ) = \\lim_{n , m_r}m_r^2/\\ln n \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which indicates that the @xmath48 sets an ir ` cutoff ' at @xmath49 and @xmath50 provides an uv ` cutoff ' .",
    "for renormalizable quantum field theories , @xmath50 can be taken to be infinity @xmath51 .",
    "in a theory without infrared divergence , @xmath52 can safely run to @xmath53 . actually , in the case that @xmath54 and @xmath53 , one recovers the initial integral .",
    "also once @xmath42 and @xmath55 are taken to be infinity , the regularized theory becomes independent of the regularization prescription .",
    "note that to evaluate the ilis , the algebraic computing for multi @xmath2 matrices involving loop momentum @xmath56 such as @xmath57 should be carried out to be expressed in terms of the independent components : @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath0 .",
    "we shall directly show that loop regularization is manifestly translational invariant in spite of the existence of two energy scales , which is a very important feature in applying to supersymmetric theories in this paper . to see that",
    ", we shall verify that the regularized ilis should arrive at the same results whether the loop regularization prescription is applied before or after shifting the integration variables for momentum . for an explicit illustration ,",

    "in fact , this property also allows us to eliminate the ambiguities and make a consistent calculation for the chiral anomaly even in the existence of linear divergent integral@xcite .",
    "the similar verification of translational invariance can be extended to the linearly and quadratically divergent integrals , which is presented in the appendix a.    the above proof can in generally be extended to higher loops based on several theorems proved in ref.@xcite , especially based on the theorem i , theorem v and theorem vi over there .",
    "the theorem i is the so - called factorization theorem for overlapping divergences which states that overlapping divergences which contain divergences of sub - integrals and overall divergences in the general feynman loop integrals become completely factorizable in the corresponding ilis .",
    "the theorem v is the so - called reduction theorem for overlapping tensor type integrals which states that the general overlapping tensor type feynman integrals of arbitrary loop graphs are eventually characterized by the overall one - fold tensor type ilis of the corresponding loop graphs .",
    "this theorem is the key theorem for the generalization of treatments and also for the prescriptions from one loop graphs to arbitrary loop graphs .",
    "the theorem vi which is the so - called relation theorem for tensor and scalar type ilis which states that for any fold tensor and scalar type ilis , as long as their power counting dimension of the integrating loop momentum are the same , then the relations between the tensor and scalar type ilis are also the same and independent of the fold number of ilis .",
    "this theorem is crucial to extend the consistency conditions of gauge invariance from divergent one loop ilis to higher loop ilis .",

    "every contraction between two field operators @xmath254 , @xmath255 can always be written in the form : @xmath256 , for example in our case : @xmath257 which indicates that the direction of momentum flow is always opposite to the direction of contraction for a propagator , and in a fermion chain the momentum flows of propagators form a continuous flow its direction is opposite to the direction of contractions . in @xcite",
    "such a folw was called as fermion flow , here we may , more precisely , call it as fermion momentum flow. this comes to the conclusion : for each fermion chain we fix an arbitrary orientation ( fermion momentum flow ) , the momentums of all fermion propagators follow this orientation , and we should write down the feynman rules proceeding opposite to the chosen orientation .    finally , to complete the majorana feynman rules , it needs to give the rules of external fermion lines and determine the rsif .",
    "the rules of external fermion lines can easily be obtained from the plan - wave decomposition of @xmath128 , see eqn.([planewave ] ) . since @xmath258 which implies that the creation of a majorana fermion corresponds to a spinor @xmath259 with momentum @xmath9 flow out , and the annihilation of a majorana fermion corresponds to a spinor @xmath260 with momentum @xmath9 flow in .",
    "if the spinor locates at the beginning of contraction , we should write it as a row vector say a @xmath261 or @xmath262 .",
    "now we can give a prescription to fix rsif .",
    "factor @xmath231 can be got from the permutation parity of the spinors in the obtained analytical expression with respect to some reference order .",
    "factor @xmath233 can be got from the number of closed fermion loops .",
    "factor @xmath235 now is a little different from which in dirac field theory . since moving any one creation operator arising from the initial state to the beginning of contraction",
    "will contribute a factor @xmath263 , and moving any one annihilation operator arising from the final state to the end of contraction which also contribute a factor @xmath263 , it seems that we should count the total number of such operation .",
    "suppose that there are @xmath264 fermions in the initial sate and @xmath265 fermions in the final state , and we must move @xmath120th fermion creation operators to the beginning and @xmath266th fermion annihilation operators to the end , then we have @xmath267 , i.e. @xmath268 . namely , @xmath269 .",
    "since @xmath264 and @xmath265 is universal for all graphs of a process , we can always omit @xmath235 all the time .    let us consider the situation that a majorana fermion @xmath128 couples to a dirac fermion @xmath225",
    ", the interaction lagrangian contains the following terms : @xmath270    when keeping a continuous `` fermion momentum flow '' for a fermion internal line , we then need to consider two types of dirac propagators : @xmath222 and @xmath271 which have the following explicit forms : @xmath272_{\\alpha\\beta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we then need to use a line with arrow to represent the dirac propagator , the arrow reflects the flow of charge which flows out of @xmath224 and into @xmath225 . if the direction of charge flow coincide with the direction of the `` fermion momentum flow '' , we should use @xmath273 , otherwise we should use @xmath274 .",
    "the feynman rules for vertexes are also doubled . for the dirac - dirac interaction",
    ", one has : @xmath275 if the direction of charge flow coincide with the direction of the momentum flow , we should use @xmath226 , otherwise we should use @xmath276 .",
    "the vertexes rules of majorana - dirac interaction can be derived similarly from the identities : @xmath277    the rsif can be determined by using the same method as we mentioned above .    with the above considerations",
    ", we can summarize our feynman rules .",
    "the solid lines are still used to denote the fermions .",
    "dirac fermions lines carry arrows which reflect the direction of charge flow , majorana lines do not carry arrows .",
    "we may write down feynman amplitudes according to the following steps :    \\1 . draw all topologically distinctive , connect feynman diagrams for a given process",
    "fix an arbitrary direction for each fermion chain .",
    "this is the direction of `` fermion momentum flow '' , which means that the momentum of every internal fermion line should follow this direction .",
    "we should write down the dirac matrices proceeding opposite to the chosen direction through the chain .    \\3 . for the external fermion lines ,",
    "the rules are shown in fig.[external ] .",
    "if the spinors locates at the beginning(end ) of contraction , we should add a superscript @xmath278 appropriately to write them as row(column ) vectors .",
