    "we recall that a _ quasi - stationary distribution _ ( qsd ) for @xmath2 is a probability measure @xmath8 on @xmath9 such that , for all @xmath10 , @xmath11 the question of existence and uniqueness of such distributions has been extensively studied in the past decades . for irreducible finite state space processes",

    "thus the existence of a qsd itself is not always true . in 1995 ,",
    "ferrari , kesten , martnez and picco  @xcite proved a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a quasi - stationary distribution for @xmath2 under the assumption that it is irreducible and that the process does nt come back from infinity in finite time .",

    "this clearly implies that @xmath8 is the unique qld for @xmath2 , independently of the initial distribution of the process .",
