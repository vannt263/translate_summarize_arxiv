    "until 1987 , dust particles around stars had only been recognised by their appearance in stellar spectra , but the possibility of studying unprocessed stellar condensates directly in the laboratory has given important information not only about the solar system formation , but has also provided precise data for testing astrophysical stellar models .",
    "presolar diamonds were the first grains to be isolated from meteorites of the carbonaceous chondrite type , which could be shown to have originated from outside the solar system ( lewis et al .",
    "the identification of their presolar origin has been possible on the basis of isotopic anomalies that appear inconsistent with any known solar system process ( anders & zinner 1993 ) .",
    "primitive meteorites show the presence of two different components .",
    "one component consist of chondrules and other inclusions which have experienced various melting processes during the formation of the solar system .",
    "the other component , called the matrix , is fine grained and have experienced little or no heating .",
    "it is in the matrix that the presolar grains are found .",
    "the presolar diamond content is very similar for all chondrite classes , around 5001000 ppm of the matrix ( alexander et al .",
    "1990 ; huss 1990 ) .",
    "their median grain size is about 2 nm ( fraundorf et al .",
    "1989 ) , which means that each diamond contain only about one thousand carbon atoms .",
    "a large fraction of the atoms are therefore on the surface of the crystal , and the meteoritic diamonds therefore consist of a mixture of diamond and hydrogenate amorphous carbon ( a - c : h ) .",
    "the amorphous part has been estimated to account for 0.46 the volume fraction of the presolar diamonds ( bernatowicz et al .",
    "1990 ) .",
    "the size distribution of the presolar diamonds is log - normal rather than power - law , reflecting growth rather than fragmentation and suggesting a short interstellar residence time ( lewis et al .",
    "this size distribution is surprising , as interstellar dust normally shows a power - law distribution , which is the steady state form for fragmentation .",
    "a log - normal distribution reflects either size - sorting or growth followed by partial conversion of small grains to large ones ( lewis et al .",
    "the good fit for the size distribution obtained by lewis et al.(1989 ) down to small sizes suggests minimal contributions from processes that affect small grains preferentially , such as fragmentation , sputtering and erosion .",
    "this suggests that the distribution is young and unevolved .",
    "various mechanisms have been proposed to account for the production of diamond grains in space , but the most likely scenario appears to be that the nano - diamonds have condensed directly from stellar outflows ( lewis et al.1987 ; jrgensen 1988 ; clayton 1989 ; clayton et al .",
    "the conditions in cool stellar outflows are remarkably similar to those employed in industry to produce diamonds by chemical vapour deposition ( cvd ) ( angus & hayman 1988 ) .",
    "the cvd mechanism makes use of the fact the the free energy difference between diamond and graphite is only around 1 kcal / mol .",
    "almost any chemical reaction yielding graphite as the thermodynamically stable product can , in principle , yield diamond as a metastable product .",
    "the trick is to steer the kinetics so as to favour diamond over graphite .",
    "it has been suggested by krger et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , that in circumstellar envelopes the surface growth processes on carbonaceous seed particles will take place at sp@xmath4 bonded carbon atoms rather than at sp@xmath5 bonded carbon atoms , which suggest that the grain material formed in circumstellar envelopes will be amorphous diamond - like carbon .    for studies of radiative processes in stellar environments , knowledge of opacities of the relevant atoms , molecules and grains",
    "are essential . in order for the grains to be taken into account in stellar atmosphere computations , knowledge of the spectral properties of the relevant grains are needed .",
    "transmission spectroscopic measurements of presolar diamonds from the allende meteorite in the ultra - violet , the optical and the infrared region are presented in this paper .",
    "the measurements were designed such that it has been possible to determine the monochromatic absorption coefficient .",
    "this coefficient is necessary in order to include the nano - diamonds in model atmosphere calculations and in synthetic spectrum calculations . by use of the derived absorption coefficient ,",
    "synthetic spectra of carbon stars with the nano - diamonds included have been calculated , under the assumption that the diamonds we have extracted have the same optical properties as they had when they formed in a stellar atmosphere .",
    "finally , we have performed similar laboratory measurements on cvd diamonds , in order to get a more solid basis for understanding the spectral features of the presolar diamonds .",
    "the presolar diamonds were extracted using the method described by tang & anders ( 1988 ) .",
    "a 10.8 g piece of the allende meteorite was dissolved by alternating treatment with 10n hf1n hcl and 6n hcl ( 10 ml / g meteorite ) to remove the silicates .",
    "the sulfur was removed with a cs@xmath2 treatment and the reactive kerogen was destroyed by oxidation with hno@xmath6 and hclo@xmath7 . to separate the diamonds",
    "the sample was dispersed by ultrasonification in 0.1 m nh@xmath7oh , producing a diamond colloid , which was extracted after centrifugation .",
    "the cvd diamonds were prepared as a hetero - epitaxial diamond film on a silicon ( 100 ) substrate which had been polished with 0.25 @xmath1 g of diamond powder before depositing the cvd diamonds .",
    "the cvd diamonds were deposited in a hot filament reactor with 8% ch@xmath7 in the h@xmath2 source gas .",
    "the filament temperature was between 2200@xmath8c and 2400@xmath8c , the substrate temperatures were between 700@xmath8c and 900@xmath8c and the pressure was 5 mbar .",
    "this gives a growth rate of about 1 @xmath1g / hour .",
    "the cvd diamonds were scraped off from the silicon substrate with a diamond needle .",
    "transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) was carried out on both the presolar diamonds and the cvd diamonds , using a philips em 430 transmission electron microscope operated at 300 kev ( fig.1 ) . with this instrument",
    "we performed conventional imaging , electron diffraction and energy - dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( eds ) with a sensitivity down to boron .",
    "we estimated that the sizes of the cvd diamonds are between 1.4 nm and 14 nm , from visual inspection of the tem images .",
    "the cvd diamonds are hence , approximately three times bigger than the meteoritic diamonds .",
    "the spectral measurements were carried out in the infrared ( 4004000 @xmath0 ; 2.525 @xmath1 m ) and in the uv / vis ( 1220052600 @xmath0 ; 190820 nm ) region .    the uv / vis spectra of the presolar and cvd diamonds were taken on a very dilute solution of 350 @xmath1 g diamonds in distilled water .",
    "the spectra were obtained with a hp 8452a diode - array spectrophotometer , which is a single - beam microprocessor - controlled spectrophotometer with a deuterium lamp as the light source giving 190 nm ",
    "820 nm wavelength range .",
    "the wavelength accuracy was @xmath9 2 nm .",
    "the sample cell was a small quartz container with dimensions 40 mm @xmath10 10 mm @xmath10 1 mm . during the measurements ,",
    "a reference spectrum of distilled water was used .",
    "the difference of the signals obtained for the quartz container filled with distilled water and the one filled with diamonds in distilled water was attributed to the absorption of the diamonds .",
    "the infrared spectra of the presolar and cvd diamonds were obtained with a ft - ir perkin elmer 1760 infrared spectrometer .",
    "the spectrometer operates in the region 4005000 @xmath0 .",
    "the instrument operation is driven by a computer station which allowed us to record the spectra in digital form .",
    "all measurements were performed with 64 scans and a resolution of 12 @xmath0 . for sample preparation",
    "the kbr technique was used , where small quantities of the sample are mixed throughly with powdered kbr ( 300 mg ) .",
    "because of the softness of kbr and its bulk transparency between 40 and 0.2 @xmath1 m , the kbr and particle mixture can be pressed into a clear pellet ( diameter = 13 mm ) ( colthup et al .",
    "1990 ) . around 300 @xmath1 g of presolar diamonds was added to the kbr as a suspension in ethanol .",
    "the diamonds were suspended in order to separate them , so that they would not be stuck in big clumps , because the diamonds are likely to have formed individually , not in agglomeration in stellar atmospheres . by suspending them we therefore expect to obtain a spectrum which compare best with the possible stellar spectrum .",
    "around 200 @xmath1 g of cvd diamonds was added to the kbr in the same way and the kbr for the reference pellets were also suspended in ethanol .",
    "the ethanol was removed by pumping on the sample before pressing the tablet . despite this ,",
    "we still had traces of ethanol in our spectra , so it was necessary to compensate for this by the use of the reference spectra .",
    "the uv / vis spectra of our presolar and cvd diamond samples are very similar to one another , showing strong absorption in the uv , with a distinct band at 217 nm ( 46000 @xmath0 ) , a flat maximum around 270 nm ( 37000 @xmath0 ) and declining absorption towards the visual end of the spectrum ( fig.2 ) .",
    "these absorption characteristics are also typical for terrestrial diamond containing pairs of nitrogen atoms ( davies 1984 ) .",
    "these bulk uv / vis features deviate significantly from the results by lewis et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , but correspond well with the measurements obtained by mutschke et al .",
    "( 1995 ) on presolar diamonds from the murchison meteorite , except that the strength of the flat maximum around 270 nm seem to be much stronger for the murchison presolar diamonds .",
    "the position of the band around 217 nm coincides with that of the interstellar extinction bump at 217.5 nm , as it has also been found by mutschke et al .",
    "( 1995 ) for the murchison meteorite .",
    "= 1.05      the infrared absorbance spectrum of the presolar diamonds shows several peaks ( table 1 and fig .",
    "the strong peaks are mainly due to impurities , meaning the presence of atoms other than c. these impurities are most likely situated at the grain surface , some of which may be due to the chemical processing in the laboratory , other , of which may refer to the astrophysical environment the grains have experienced .",
    "the strong peaks at 3420 @xmath0 and 1632 @xmath0 are most likely due to h@xmath2o ( chrenko et al .",
    "these peaks are strong and sharp , which makes tightly bound water a likely possibility ( nyquist & kagel 1971 ) .",
    "this interpretation of the spectrum is further supported by the peaks at 607 @xmath0 and 471 @xmath0 .",
    ".wavenumber of our measured ir bands , in @xmath0 , detected in the spectra of the presolar diamonds from the allende meteorite and from cvd diamonds , respectively . also listed are our suggestions for assignments of the bands . [",

    "1989 ; koike et al .",
    "see table 2 .",
    "normally a diamond can not be wetted with water , but under certain conditions the water - repelling nature of the surface disappears ( davies 1984 . )",
    "it has been shown for terrestrial diamonds that if the diamond is heated to a few hundred degrees centigrade in o@xmath2 , the water - repelling nature of the surface disappears ; while heating the diamond in vacuum or in an atmosphere of h restores its water - repelling nature ( sappok & boehm 1968 ) .",
    "this means that , if these water features are intrinsic ( as oppose to being an effect of not fully reduced water spectral features from humidity in the kbr pellet ) , they can not originate from when the diamonds were formed in a carbon / hydrogen rich atmosphere , but rather is an artifact which most likely originates from the very rough chemical treatment that was used in order to extract the diamonds .",
    "the peak around 3400 @xmath0 obtained by lewis et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , for diamonds from the allende meteorite , was interpreted by them as coming from cooh .",
    "we consider this peak to be too high in wavenumber and too narrow to be assigned oh in cooh , while we find a good fit with known spectral bands of water",
    ". also the band at 1774 @xmath0 is somewhat high in wavenumber for a cooh interpretation .",
    "the cooh interpretation has also been questioned by mutschke et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and hill et al .",
    "variations in the intensity and in the presence of a peak around 1740 @xmath0 have also been observed in the spectra of cvd diamonds , where the peak varied considerably for spectra obtained at different times and with different ir spectrometers ( janssen 1991 ) .",
    "the triplet around 2900 @xmath0 and the peaks around 1400 @xmath0 can all be ascribed to the presence of saturated hydrocarbons ( aliphatic compounds ) , but the peaks around 1400 @xmath0 are also in the right range for n in diamond ( lewis et al .  1989 ) .",
    "h stretch at 3236 @xmath0 and the broad band around 1100 @xmath0 present in most of the published spectra of meteoritic diamonds can be ascribed to various forms of nitrogen in and on the diamonds .",
    "presolar diamonds have been shown by russel et al .",
    "( 1991 ) to be nitrogen rich .",
    "part of the 1100 @xmath0 peak can also be attributed to c  o stretching in aliphatic ethers but the feature around 1084 @xmath0 could just as well be due to c ",
    "n stretching and is in the right range for single n in terrestrial diamonds ( clark et al .  1979 ) .",
    "we attribute the weak shoulder at 633 @xmath0 to c  cl stretch based on a comparison with the spectra obtained by koike et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , of diamond - like residues from the allende meteorite and on the fact that terrestrial diamonds does not show absorption in this wavelength region ( davies 1977 ) . in the spectra obtained by koike",
    "( 1995 ) they have a very sharp peak at 630 @xmath0 which fits the pattern of a ccl stretch and the small splitting of the feature in their spectra could be due to isotopic effects ( @xmath11cl , @xmath12cl ) .",
    "since they have used part of the same treatment as we did , it seems very likely that both spectra could contain an impurity which originates from hcl .",
    "the infrared absorbance spectrum of the cvd diamonds also show several peaks , many of which correspond to the peaks found for the presolar diamonds .",
    "the primary differences between the spectral properties of the presolar diamonds and the cvd diamonds , are that the cvd diamonds have spectral characteristics closer related to soot than have the presolar diamonds .",
    "= 1.05    the nitrogen which is present in the cvd diamonds is due to nitrogen impurities in the ch@xmath7/h@xmath2 gas mixture that was used during the deposition ( locher et al .",

    "the peaks we attribute to o ",
    "h at 3418 @xmath0 , 1640 @xmath0 and 579 @xmath0 are broader for the cvd diamonds than for the presolar diamonds , indicating that the water present here is not tightly bound .",

    "are at wavenumber greater than 1400 @xmath0 ( @xmath13 m ) , with a peak around 2000 @xmath0 ( 5 @xmath1 m ) for pure diamond , while that below 1400 @xmath0 ( @xmath14 m ) is specimen dependent both in strength and shape ( davies 1977 ) and is caused by impurities , typically nitrogen .",

    "it is not possible by ir - spectroscopy to distinguish whether the impurities in or on the diamonds are due to the chemical processing in the laboratory , in the interstellar space , during the solar system formation or whether the `` impurities '' are original features which refer to the astrophysical environment the grains have experienced .",
    "it has been shown by russel et al .",

    "( 1989 ) that the presolar diamonds also carry anomalous hydrogen with @xmath17h/@xmath5d = 5193 ( terrestrial = 6667 ) implying that at least some of the h and n must be presolar . from a spectroscopic point of view",
    "it does not really matter whether the hydrogen bonds on the surface of the grains are `` original '' from the stellar environment or have been replaced at a later stage , as long as the presence of hydrogen is to be expected on the grain surface in the stellar environment .",
    "of course , then a replacement by a different element will make a difference .",
    "this makes the whole discussion about facts and artifacts in the spectra of presolar diamonds complicated , since if the presolar diamonds are exposed to a very rough chemical treatment to clean them as much as possible , it might be possible to get a clean surface of the diamonds , but the obtained spectra might not resemble what we can expect to observe if the nano - diamonds , at their place of origin , are not clean but characterised by c ",

    "a base line is drawn tangent to the spectrum at the wings of the analytical band , and its intersection with a vertical line at the analytical wavenumber is used for @xmath20 . no correction for scattering",
    "was performed for the uv / vis measurements , since the amount of scattering in the experiment was very small .",
    "the primary reason for scattering in the measured ir transmittance spectrum is that when the sample is incorporated in a kbr matrix the size of the kbr grains will force the sample grains to lay around the much larger kbr grains , resulting in some clumping of the sample .",

    "the same features as in fig.3 are therefore seen here too . some of these may be artifacts caused by the extraction procedure , as discussed above , but all the measured spectral features are shown here for completeness .",

    "the outcome of synthetic spectrum computations based on a fixed model structure , is almost identical spectra independent of whether the diamonds are included in the spectra or not .",
    "in addition , the 3 @xmath1 m diamond feature is likely to be an artifact of the chemical extraction procedure , as discussed above , so that the real intrinsic diamond spectral features may be even weaker",
    ". also at 6 and 9 @xmath1 m , where the total molecular absorption is weaker than at 3 @xmath1 m , the diamond features are weak compared to the molecular spectral features .    generally , grain nucleation ( as opposed to grain growth ) is the bottle neck in stellar dust formation .",
    "polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pah ) are often assumed to be the molecular nucleation seeds for dust growth in carbon stars . in hydrodynamic model atmospheres , however , the time scales for pah formation are too long compared to the dynamical time scales , and in the corresponding hydrostatic photospheres the gas temperature is too high for pah formation ( helling et al .",
    "the relatively modest opacity , and higher condensation temperature of the diamonds than that of the pah molecules , may cause nucleation of diamond grains at relatively high atmospheric densities , where the velocity field is still negligible ( hence , the hydrostatic approximation is acceptable here ) .",
    "if nucleation of diamond dust ( as oppose to pah ) can act as seeds for grain growth in carbon stars , the long dynamical time scales in the region of diamond condensation may therefore contribute to the solution of the nucleation problem mentioned above .",
    "if diamonds are the nucleation seeds of other dust grains , then we should of course expect that the presolar diamonds were part of agglomerates or part of heterogeneous larger grains when they left the parent stellar atmosphere , rather than being pure diamonds ( but our considerations above about the photospheric spectra would still apply , since the small , high - temperature diamond seeds will form as individual grains in the pseudo - hydrostatic , denser photosphere before the agglomeration ) .",
    "such larger grains may , however , have been destroyed in the interstellar space or in the solar nebula .",
    "if they survived all the way to being included in the carbonaceous chondrites , they would unfortunately most likely be dissolved during the present chemical extraction procedure , and the development of a more gentle extraction procedure could therefore add important new information about the origin of the presolar diamonds .",
    "the obtained spectra of the presolar diamonds show many features which are mostly dominated by o ",

    "h features does probably not originate from when the nano - diamonds were formed in a carbon / hydrogen rich environment , but is rather an artifact originating from the very rough chemical treatment that is used to extract the diamonds , but the c  h , c  n and n  h ( if the nitrogen inclusions are situated at the surface ) bonds could very well be responsible for the features we should expect to detect if diamonds are present in a stellar environment .",
    "this mean that the uv / vis features around 217 and 270 nm ( paired n in diamond ) , the feature around 3200 @xmath0 ( n  h ) , the features around 2900 @xmath0 ( c  h ) and 1100 @xmath0 ( c  n / c  c / interstitial n ) and the features around 350 @xmath0 ( c  n  c ) and 125 @xmath0 ( unidentified ) are all promising features when trying to establish the presence of nano - diamonds .",
    "knowledge of the monochromatic absorption coefficient is necessary in order to include grains in model atmosphere calculations and in synthetic spectrum calculations , which are needed for comparison with high - resolution observed spectra . in the models presented here the diamond spectrum is weak compared to the molecular spectral features , indicating that an observational identification of diamonds not will be straight forward .",
    "the effect on the atmospheric structure is however substantial , and nano - diamonds could play an important role in the grain nucleation process .",
    "we have presented here the computed spectrum as it would look like if the diamonds form in carbon stars ( under the simplified assumptions described above ) . our measured monochromatic absorption coefficient ( which is available from the authors )",
    "can likewise be used by other authors , doing models of other objects , for predicting the spectrum from such objects .    beside carbon stars ,",
    "the other possible candidates for the diamond formation includes novae ( clayton et al .",
    "1995 ) , carbon rich wolf - rayet stars ( tielens 1990 ; arnould et al .",
    "1993 ) , and young expanding supernova remnants with dust originating from the deeper layers of the star ( clayton 1989 ; clayton et al . 1995 ) .    until now",
    ", the observational searches for presolar diamond grains have focused on the interstellar medium .",
    "one of the most encouraging results is the present identification by allamandola et al .",
    "( 1992 ) of an absorption band in four dense molecular clouds ( proto stars ) at 3.47 @xmath1 m ( 2882 @xmath0 ) , which they attributed to a tertiary c ",
    "h stretching mode , and tentatively interpreted as due to hydrogenate nano - diamonds .",
    "we notice that this absorption band is in the exact right region to be a mix of the two absorption features we observe at 2927 @xmath0 and 2856 @xmath0 , present in our infrared spectrum of the presolar diamonds .",
    "other searches for diamonds in interstellar space have , however , mainly reached negative results ( sandford et al .",
    "1991 and references therein ) , and for this there might be at least three reasons ; one is that the presence of functional groups attached to the surface of the grains will alter the absorption features .",
    "the second reason is that the nano - diamonds might be included in other dust grains , if they work as the nucleation seed , the third reason is that the stellar grains are likely to be covered with ices while in interstellar space .",
    "the possible interstellar diamond spectrum is therefore expected to be quite different ( or absent if the grain mantle or ice cover is sufficiently thick ) from the obtained laboratory spectrum .",
    "diamonds is the major known presolar component in meteorites , but their origin is still a puzzle . we have presented here data , and preliminary analysis based on these data , which might make it possible to identify their place of origin .",
    "an observational identification of the stellar source of the presolar grains would lead to improved understanding of the upper layers of stellar atmospheres , grain formation , the mass loss process , and of the detailed chemical evolution of our galaxy .",
    "the authors would like to thank roy lewis for detailed advice on the extraction of the presolar grains , carsten nrgrd for making the cvd diamonds , merete torpe for help with the uv / vis spectrometer , lykke ryelund for help with the ir - spectrometer and daniel hjgaard christensen for valuable discussions .",
