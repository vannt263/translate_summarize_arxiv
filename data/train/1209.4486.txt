    "jet quenching occurs when in a heavy - ion collision an energetic parton propagating in one light - cone direction loses sufficient energy that few high momentum hadrons are seen in the final state , where in the vacuum there would be a jet . in this context",
    ", a parton is considered highly energetic when its momentum @xmath1 is much larger than any other energy scale , including those characterizing the medium .",
    "jet quenching , which has been observed at rhic @xcite and at lhc @xcite , manifests itself in many ways .",
    "in particular , the hard partons produced in the collision lose energy and change direction of their momenta .",

    "a  related quantity is the jet quenching parameter , @xmath0 , which is the mean square transverse momentum picked up by the hard parton per unit distance traveled : @xmath7 in the following , we will review the derivation of a gauge invariant expression for @xmath2 in the case of the propagation of a highly energetic quark .",

    "if the quark propagates in a medium whose energy scales are much smaller than @xmath1 , then we can define a parameter @xmath15 , which is the ratio of the energy scale characterizing the medium and @xmath1 .",

    "we set up to describe the propagation of a single collinear quark in the medium .",
    "a collinear quark may scatter in the medium with ultrasoft gluons , whose momenta scale like @xmath19 , with glauber gluons , whose momenta scale like @xmath20 or @xmath21 or with soft gluons scaling like @xmath22 through the emission of virtual hard - collinear quarks scaling like @xmath23 . the relevant degrees of freedom are shown in fig .",
