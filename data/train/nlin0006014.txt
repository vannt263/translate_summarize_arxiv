    "<S> the predictability problem in the inverse energy cascade of two - dimensional turbulence is addressed by means of direct numerical simulations . the growth rate as a function of the error level </S>",
    "<S> is determined by means of a finite size extension of the lyapunov exponent . for error within the inertial range , </S>",
    "<S> the linear growth of the error energy , predicted by dimensional argument , is verified with great accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical findings are in close agreement with the result of tfm closure approximation .    </S>",
    "<S> unpredictability is an essential property of turbulent flows . </S>",
    "<S> turbulence is characterized by a large number of degrees of freedom interacting with a nonlinear dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> thus turbulence is chaotic ( and hence unpredictable ) , but the standard approach of dynamical system theory is not sufficient to characterize predictability in turbulence .    in fully developed turbulence </S>",
    "<S> , the maximum lyapunov exponent diverges with the reynolds number thus being very large for typical turbulent flows . nevertheless , a large value of the lyapunov exponent do not imply automatically shot time predictability . </S>",
    "<S> a familiar example is the atmosphere dynamics : convective motions in the atmosphere make the small scale features unpredictable after one hour or less , but large scale dynamics can be predicted for several days , as it is demonstrated by weather forecasting . </S>",
    "<S> this effect , which can be called `` strong chaos with weak butterfly effect '' arises in systems possessing many characteristic scales and times . from this point of view , turbulence probably represents the example most extensively studied .    </S>",
    "<S> the first attempts to the study of predictability in turbulence dates back to the pioneering work of lorenz @xcite and to kraichnan and leith papers @xcite . on the basis of closure approximations , it was possible to obtain quantitative predictions on the evolution of the error in different turbulent situations , both in two and three dimensions .    </S>",
    "<S> a more recent approach to the problem is based on dynamical system theory . </S>",
    "<S> one of the first results is the ruelle prediction on the scaling of the lyapunov exponent with the reynolds number @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> chaotic properties have been extensively investigated in simplified models of turbulence , called shell models , with particular emphasis on the relations with intermittency @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> because predictability experiments in fully developed turbulence are numerically rather expensive , a similar study on direct numerical simulations of navier  stokes equations is still lacking .    </S>",
    "<S> in this letter we address the predictability problem for two  dimensional turbulence by means of high resolution direct numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> turbulence is generated in the inverse cascade regime where a robust energy cascade is observed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of intermittency corrections makes the problem simpler than in the three  dimensional case : velocity statistics ( energy spectrum , structure functions ) is found to be in close agreement with self - similar theory  la kolmogorov .    </S>",
    "<S> = 8truecm    the model equation is the two  dimensional navier  stokes equation written for the scalar vorticity @xmath0 with generalized dissipation and linear friction @xmath1 where @xmath2 represent the jacobian with the stream function @xmath3 from which the velocity is @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 is the order of the dissipation , @xmath6 for ordinary dissipation , @xmath7 for hyperviscosity . </S>",
    "<S> as it is customary in numerical simulations , we use hyperviscous dissipation ( @xmath8 ) in order to extend the inertial range . </S>",
    "<S> although this can affect the small scale features of the vorticity field @xcite , in our simulations dissipation is not involved in the cascade and has simply the role of removing enstrophy at small scales . </S>",
    "<S> the friction term in ( [ eq:1 ] ) removes energy at large scales : it is necessary in order to avoid bose  </S>",
    "<S> einstein condensation on the gravest mode @xcite and to obtain a stationary state . </S>",
    "<S> energy is injected into the system by a random forcing @xmath9correlated in time which is active on a shell of wavenumbers around @xmath10 only . </S>",
    "<S> numerical integration of ( [ eq:1 ] ) is performed by a standard pseudo - spectral code fully dealiased with second  order adams  </S>",
    "<S> bashforth time stepping on a doubly periodic square domain with resolution @xmath11 .    </S>",
    "<S> stationary turbulent flow is obtained after a very long simulation starting from a zero vorticity initial field . at stationarity </S>",
    "<S> we observe a wide inertial range with a well developed kolmogorov energy spectrum @xmath12 ( figure  [ fig:1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> structure functions in physical space are found in agreement with the self - similar kolmogorov theory @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> starting from the stationary configuration , the predictability experiment integrates two different realizations of the turbulent field and looks at the evolution of the difference ( or error ) field defined for the velocity coordinates as @xmath13    from ( [ eq:2 ] ) one defines the error energy and the error energy spectrum as @xcite @xmath14    normalization in ( [ eq:2 ] ) ensures that @xmath15 for uncorrelated fields ( i.e. for @xmath16 ) .    assuming infinitesimal initial errors , the magnitude of the difference field starts to grow exponentially and @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the maximum lyapunov exponent of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the error growth is this stage is confined at the faster scales in the inertial range , corresponding in our model to the scales close to the forcing wavenumber @xmath10 ( see figure  [ fig:1 ] ) . for finite errors , </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath19 becomes comparable with @xmath20 , the exponential growth terminate and an algebraic regime sets in . </S>",
    "<S> the dimensional prediction proposed by lorenz @xcite assumes that the time it takes for the error to induce a complete uncertainty at wavenumber @xmath21 is proportional to the characteristic time at that scale , @xmath22 . within the kolmogorov framework , @xmath23 . at larger scales </S>",
    "<S> the error is still very small in comparison with the typical energy . </S>",
    "<S> we thus can write @xmath24 by inserting ( [ eq:5 ] ) in ( [ eq:4 ] ) , using the kolmogorov spectrum for @xmath25 and inverting the dimensional expression for @xmath26 one ends with the prediction @xcite @xmath27 the numerical constant @xmath28 in ( [ eq:6 ] ) can be obtained only by repeating the argument more formally within a closure framework @xcite . in figure  [ fig:2 ] </S>",
    "<S> we plot the time evolution of the error energy @xmath29 obtained from direct numerical simulations averaged over @xmath30 realizations . </S>",
    "<S> both the exponential regime a small time and the linear regime ( [ eq:6 ] ) are visible .    </S>",
    "<S> = 8truecm    the dimensional predictability argument given above can be rephrased in a language more close to dynamical systems by introducing the finite size lyapunov exponent analysis . </S>",
    "<S> fsle is a generalization of the lyapunov exponent to finite size errors , which was recently proposed for the analysis of systems with many characteristic scales @xcite . in a nutshell one </S>",
    "<S> computes the `` error doubling time '' @xmath31 , i.e. the time it takes for an error of size @xmath32 to grow of a factor @xmath33 ( for @xmath34 we have actually a doubling time ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fsle is defined in term of the average doubling time as @xmath35 it is easy to show that definition ( [ eq:7 ] ) reduces to the standard lyapunov exponent @xmath18 in the infinitesimal error limit @xmath36 @xcite . for finite error , the fsle measures the effective error growth rate at error size @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> let us remark that taking averages at fixed time , as in ( [ eq:6 ] ) is not the same of averaging at fixed error size , as in ( [ eq:7 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is particularly true in the case of intermittent systems , in which strong fluctuations of the error in different realizations can hide scaling laws like ( [ eq:6 ] ) @xcite . from a numerical point of view , the computation of @xmath37 is not more expensive than the computation of the lyapunov exponent with a standard algorithm .    the same dimensional argument leading to </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:6 ] ) , repeated for @xmath31 , gives the prediction for the fsle in energy cascade inertial range @xmath38 where the constant @xmath39 is again not determined by dimensional arguments .    </S>",
    "<S> the scaling ( [ eq:8 ] ) , which can be shown to be not affected by possible intermittency corrections ( as in 3d turbulence @xcite ) , is valid within the inertial range @xmath40 where @xmath41 represents the typical velocity fluctuation at forcing wavenumber and @xmath42 is the large scale velocity .    </S>",
    "<S> = 8truecm    figure  [ fig:3 ] shows the fsle computed from our simulations . for small errors @xmath43 ( corresponding to an error spectrum @xmath44 ) we observe the convergence of @xmath37 to the leading lyapunov exponent . </S>",
    "<S> its value is essentially the inverse of the smallest characteristic time in the system and represents the growth rate of the most unstable features . at larger </S>",
    "<S> @xmath45 we clearly see the transition to the inertial range scaling ( [ eq:8 ] ) . at further large @xmath46 , @xmath37 falls down to zero in correspondence of error saturation .    </S>",
    "<S> in order to emphasize scaling ( [ eq:8 ] ) , in figure  [ fig:3 ] we also show the compensation of @xmath37 with @xmath47 . prediction ( [ eq:8 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> is verified with very high accuracy which allows to determine the value of @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> the constant @xmath39 relates the energy flux in the cascade to the rate of error growth . in absence of intermittency and with @xmath49 </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to relate ( [ eq:6 ] ) to ( [ eq:8 ] ) . in the present case ( @xmath50 ) one obtains @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to observe that the numerical result is very close to the old prediction obtained by a test field model closure @xcite which gives @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> at least from the point of view of predictability , two - dimensional turbulence seems to be very well captured by low - order closure scheme . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> we can exclude , on the basis of our numerical findings , the existence of intermittency effects in the inverse cascade of error . </S>",
    "<S> this is a result which is probably of more general interest than the specific problem discussed in this letter . </S>"
