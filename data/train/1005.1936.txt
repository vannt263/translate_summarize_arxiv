    "it is well known that the renormalization group ( rg ) equation fixes the relationship between different contributions to the effective potential @xcite when using perturbation theory . in the massless o(n ) symmetric @xmath11 model when one uses the coleman - weinberg renormalization scheme , the perturbative expansion of @xmath0 involves powers of @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the renormalization scale ; the @xmath14-loop contribution to @xmath0 is proportional to @xmath15 and powers of @xmath12 up to and including @xmath16 .",
    "the n - loop rg functions for this model ( @xmath17 , the usual beta function , and @xmath18 , the anomalous dimension ) are known to be related to the @xmath14-loop expression for @xmath0 ; it has also been shown that the @xmath14-loop expressions for @xmath17 and @xmath18 are completely determined by the @xmath19-loop expression for @xmath0 , and furthermore , once @xmath17 and @xmath18 are known , portions of @xmath0 beyond order @xmath19 are fixed @xcite . if one were to use the coleman - weinberg ( cw ) renormalization scheme @xcite , then these portions of @xmath0 can be summed systematically @xcite without the appearance of any unknown parameter .",
    "if the one - loop rg functions are known , then the contributions to @xmath0 containing the highest power of @xmath12 at each order of perturbation theory can be summed exactly .",
    "this is known as the `` leading - log '' ( ll ) sum . in general ,",
    "if the rg functions are known at @xmath14-loop order in the cw renormalization scheme , then the contributions to the m@xmath20 loop contribution to @xmath0 containing @xmath21 powers of @xmath12 can be summed  this is the n@xmath22ll sum .",

    "we next consider another rearrangement of the perturbative contributions to @xmath0 , this time expanding @xmath0 in powers of @xmath12 with the coefficients being dependent solely on the coupling @xmath28 with contributions coming from all orders of the loop expansion .",
    "the rg equation fixes the coefficient of the n@xmath20 power of @xmath12 in terms of the coefficient of the @xmath29 power of @xmath12 ; by iterating this dependency , all of these coefficients can be expressed in terms of the contribution to @xmath0 independent of @xmath12 . a second condition , that @xmath0 have an extremum when @xmath30 , serves to fix this @xmath31-independent piece of @xmath0 .",

    "we reexamine the massless @xmath11 model , this time using the cw renormalization scheme . here",
    "we find that not only is the potential `` flat '' , but also that the coupling vanishes .",
    "the model is consequently `` trivial '' ; this feature has previously been discussed in ref .",

    "we also consider the n@xmath3ll ( p = 0,1,2 ) contributions to @xmath0 in the @xmath32 scheme and find that this pattern reoccurs .",
