    "it has been shown that the near - field amplification is mainly due to the tunneling of evanescent photons , which do not participate to the exchange in the far field  @xcite .",
    "this amplification is even more remarkable if the bodies support surface resonances , such as plasmons for metals or phonon - polaritons for polar materials : in this case the heat transfer is almost monochromatic around the surface - resonance frequency  @xcite .",

    "we suppose that the sizes of the objects are small compared with the smallest thermal wavelength @xmath11 so that all individual objects can be modeled as simple radiating electrical dipoles @xmath12 and magnetic dipoles @xmath13 . here",
    "we limit our discussion to non - magnetic materials ( i.e.  @xmath14 ) .",
    "we assume that the time scale produced by radiative heat exchanges is large compared to the phonon thermalization time in each object ( typically of the order of some picoseconds for a nanoparticle ) . under this hypothesis ,",

    "is governed by the following energy equations @xmath16 @xmath17 where the lhs is the time variation of the internal energy of object @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 representing its mass density , heat capacity and volume , respectively .",

    ", we fix its @xmath119 coordinate as @xmath120 and vary its @xmath121 coordinate . in fig .",
    "[ figure_1 ] we show three different configurations in which the distances between dipole 1 ( or 2 ) and 3 are 700 nm ( panels ( a)-(b ) ) , 400 nm ( panels ( c)-(d ) ) and 200 nm ( panels ( e)-(g ) ) . for each geometry , we study the time evolution of the three temperatures with the initial conditions @xmath122k and @xmath123k .",
    "we thus assume that from a configuration in which the entire system was at thermal equilibrium at ambient temperature , we heat one of the particles ( dipole 1 ) up to 350k .",
    "the evolution of the three temperatures is compared to the evolution of one single dipole heated up to 350k ( red curve in figure ) and to the case of two dipoles ( 1 and 2 ) at a distance of 400 nm ( black curves in figure ) .",
    "our interest is in particular to show how the presence of a third particle modifies the thermalization process of particle 2 .        as expected on physical grounds , fig .",
    "[ figure_1 ] shows that the three dipoles thermalize to the temperature of the bath @xmath123k . for our choices of materials and distances ,",
    "this process takes approximately 1s , in presence of one , two or three dipoles and is apparently almost independent from the geometrical configuration . on the contrary",
    ", it is manifest that a different time scale exists associated to a thermalization process taking place between the three particles . in the first case",
    "[ see fig .",
    "[ figure_1](a ) ] , the distance between dipoles 1 ( or 2 ) and 3 is such that the presence of dipole 3 plays a negligible role on the dynamics of the temperatures of dipoles 1 and 2 , which is very close to the two - body case . in this case ,",
    "dipoles 1 and 2 thermalize between each other around @xmath124s , whereas the temperature of dipole 3 is modified very weakly and locally in time with respect to the equilibrium value of 300k .",
    "the situation is clearly different in the case depicted in fig .",
    "[ figure_1](c ) , corresponding to an equilateral triangle . in this case , as obvious from symmetry arguments , dipoles 2 and 3 follow exactly the same evolution and the figure shows the existence ( as in the two - dipole case ) of a different time scale associated to near - field interactions .",
    "the third and last case [ fig .",
    "[ figure_1](e ) ] , in which the dipoles are aligned and the minimum distance is 200 nm instead of 400 nm , proves first of all that this new time scale is extremely sensitive to the distance between the dipoles . in this case , dipole 3 is heated faster than dipole 2 , coherently with the fact that it is closer to dipole 1 .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that reducing the distance between dipole 3 and 2 as well makes dipole 3 act as a bridge between dipoles 1 and 2 producing a remarkable acceleration ( of approximately one order of magnitude ) of its temperature dynamics . in this last case",
    ", we can clearly identify an interval of time during which thermalization between dipoles is produced , at a temperature significantly different from the one of the bath . in this case",
    ", we also compare the three - body result to the two - body case at a distance of 200 nm . we clearly identify an interval of time during which dipole 2 has a temperature still close to 300k , while the temperature of dipole 3 deviates from 300k following the two - body dynamics .",
    "this clearly proves that the time scale associated to the dynamics at a distance of 200 nm is significantly faster than the one corresponding to @xmath125 nm .    from this numerical example",
    "it becomes apparent that the smallest distance between particles determines the time scale on which the heat flux is exchanged between the particles .",
    "further , for the distances considered in the present work this times scale is still several orders of magnitude larger than the one associated with internal phonon thermalization inside each dipole .",
    "this justifies the assumption made at the beginning ( see sec .",
    "[ secphyssyst ] ) allowing us to associate a temperature to each particle as a function of time .    some more insight on the temperature dynamics",
    "is given by panels ( b ) , ( d ) , ( f ) and ( g ) of fig .",
    "[ figure_1 ] , where the power absorbed by dipole 2 is represented for the three cases under scrutiny .",
    "this power is decomposed in the three contributions coming from dipole 1 , dipole 3 and from the bath . for small @xmath126 ,",
    "the power absorbed by dipole 2 comes almost entirely from dipole 1 , as expected .",
    "moreover , in panel ( b ) the distance between dipoles 3 and 2 is such that the power exchanged between them is negligible , while around @xmath124s the temperature difference between dipoles 1 and 2 is such that the ( negative ) power absorbed by dipole 2 and coming from the bath starts being comparable ( and later on larger ) to the exchange between dipoles 1 and 2 .",
    "this comparison shows that , even in the near field , at some point the temperature difference and the intra - dipole thermalization fixes the time interval during which only the far - field exchange with the bath matters . as far as panel ( d )",
    "is concerned , no power is exchanged between dipoles 3 and 2 , since their temperatures always coincide .",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting to underline that in this case the power exchanged with the bath is ( slightly ) modified with respect to the first case .",
    "this proves that even the far - field interaction is affected by the geometrical configuration and near - field properties .",
    "the third case ( with the three dipoles aligned ) has a dramatically different power - time diagram with respect to the first two cases . in this case , after a strong exchange with dipole 1 , dipole 2 starts absorbing more energy from dipole 3 , which is hotter than dipole 2 [ see fig .",
    "[ figure_1](e ) ] .",
    "we also see that intra - dipole power exchanges become negligible around @xmath127s , time at which the thermalization between the particles has almost finished . finally , panel ( g ) shows , in the same power scale of the previous ones , that the exchange with the bath is again modified by near - field properties , and in particular accelerated by about one order of magnitude .    in the next section",
    ", we will see how changing the material properties of one of the three dipoles affects near - field effects and temperature dynamics .      in the previous section ,",
    "the three particles have always been considered to be made of the same material ( sic ) .",
    "it is well known that even in stationary configuration this choice maximizes the heat flux , since it produces the best possible coupling between surface modes ( phonon - polaritons , in the considered case of a polar material ) , which give the main contribution to heat transfer in near field  @xcite . in order to see how the dynamics changes if this coupling is no longer present , we consider a specific geometrical configuration , and analyze the cases in which one particle at a time is replaced with a different material .        to be more specific ,",
    "we consider a set of coordinates @xmath116 , @xmath128 nm , and @xmath129 nm . two among the three particles are made of sic , while the third one is made of gold , described using a drude model @xmath130 with @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "the three cases in which one of the sic particles is replaced by a gold one are compared in fig .",
    "[ figure_2 ] to the case of three sic particles .",
    "the choice of gold is motivated by the fact that the plasmon resonance it supports lies in the ultraviolet range , thus both far from the resonance of sic and outside the region where the population @xmath133 takes non - negligible values at the chosen temperatures .    in fig .",
    "[ figure_2](a ) the standard case of three sic particles is represented .",
    "we see the effects already discussed in the previous section , and in particular the possibility of modifying the time scale of thermalization thanks to near - field interactions .",
    "figure [ figure_2](b ) represents the case in which particle 1 , the only particle heated up to 350k in the system , is made of gold .",
    "we observe two phenomena : first of all the coupling between particle 1 and particles 2 and 3 is almost absent , and the temperatures of both particles 2 and 3 remain close to 300k during the entire process .",
    "moreover , also the time scale of thermalization toward the temperature of the bath is modified .",
    "this modification is due to the fact , anticipated before , that the resonance of gold is at a frequency at which the population @xmath133 is negligible , and as a consequence the coupling ( even with the bath ) is much weaker with respect to the case of sic . in fig .",
    "[ figure_2](c ) the second particle is replaced with a gold one . in this case",
    "we see that its temperature is at any time indistinguishable from 300k , meaning that it does not feel any coupling to particles 1 and 3 . for these particles ,",
    "we observe , on the contrary , a typical two - body dynamics , with a thermalization between the dipoles taking place more quickly than the one toward the bath temperature . in fig .",
    "[ figure_2](d ) , finally , we observe a two - body dynamics between particles 1 and 2 [ the same described by black curves in fig .",
    "[ figure_2](a ) ] , while particle 3 , made of gold , does not participate to the energy exchange .",
    "figures [ figure_2](c ) and [ figure_2](d ) present indeed two different temperature dynamics , the difference being the fact the particles 1 and 3 are closer than particles 1 and 2 .      in this section",
    "we focus our attention on a stationary problem , that is the distribution of temperatures among the particles for @xmath134 . in this limit",
    "the lhs of eq .   is zero such that @xmath32 is zero for all particles .",
    "it is evident that , for any choice of initial temperatures @xmath135 , without an external source of energy the temperatures in the long - time limit coincide with @xmath10 .",
    "we thus assume in this section that one of the particles , say particle 1 , is heated up to 350k as in the time - dependent simulations , but kept at this temperature by means of a thermostat .",
    "we are interested in showing how the positions of particles 2 and 3 modify the temperatures these particle assume for @xmath134 . to this aim ,",
    "for a given geometrical configuration we calculate the matrices @xmath103 and @xmath104 , the power absorbed by particles 2 and 3 [ using eq .  ] , and impose that these powers are zero in order to find @xmath136 and @xmath137 .    in order to reduce the number of degrees of freedom we consider the case in which particle 1 is placed at the origin , particle 2 has coordinates @xmath117 and particle 3 is located in @xmath138 .",
    "we are left with two independent variables , namely @xmath139 and @xmath140 , as a function of which we study the equilibrium temperature @xmath136 of particle 2 .",

    "moreover , we see that starting from values of @xmath140 of the order of 500 nm the presence of particle 3 no longer plays a role : on a given horizontal line we are left with the distribution of equilibrium temperature particle 2 would have in presence of particle 1 only .",
    "as expected , this distribution goes to 300k ( to @xmath10 ) when @xmath139 increases , and in particular for @xmath139 above 700 nm .",
    "on the contrary , @xmath136 is close to 350k ( to @xmath146 ) for @xmath139 smaller than 300 nm . when the coordinate @xmath140 of particle 3 is modified , the dependence of @xmath136 on @xmath139 is deeply affected , and in particular for small @xmath140 , between 0 and 200 nm , even for @xmath139 as large as 1@xmath147 m the temperature @xmath136 is still close to the average between @xmath146 and @xmath10 .",
    "this gives an alternative evidence of the fact that the presence of particle 3 can act as a bridge for near - field interaction between the external particles 1 and 2 .",
    "moreover , this calculation shows that a localized heating and the use of few external energy sources can be actively exploited to produce a desired time - independent temperature profile in a collection of dipoles by acting on their geometrical distribution .",
    "we have used a purely fluctuational - electrodynamic approach to deduce the power absorbed by each particle in a collection of @xmath0 particles described as @xmath0 dipoles immersed in a thermal bath .",
    "these powers have been used to study the time evolution of @xmath0 temperatures with respect to different initial conditions .",
    "we have also addressed the study of the distribution of temperatures when one of the particle temperatures is kept fixed in time by applying a thermostat .",
    "first of all , we have shown that near - field interactions introduce a different time scale of thermalization compared with the one associated wth far - field exchanges with the thermal bath . at short distances , in the regime of near - field interaction ( typically for distances of the order of 100 nm ) , the system shows first a thermalization between the particles , which then behave as a complex system thermalizing towards the bath temperature .",
    "the difference between these two time scales can go up to approximately two orders of magnitude by tuning the interaction between the nanoparticles .",
    "we have shown numerically that the intra - particle relaxation is extremely sensitive to the distance and we have also shown that , even in the simple case of three particles , the third particle modifies the temperature dynamics of the two others and also the time - dependent power they exchange between each other .",
    "we have also proved that this phenomenon depends strongly on the existence and the frequency of surface resonances : the coupling decreases drastically if the particles do not share a common surface mode .",
    "finally , we have also considered the case in which the temperature of one of the particles is fixed in time , showing that the positions of the other particles can be used to manipulate their equilibrium temperature .",
    "our results show that many - body near - field interactions constitute a promising tool to tailor both time - dependent and time - independent heat fluxes and temperature distributions in a complex plasmonic system .",
    "this work paves the way to several interesting developments .",
    "first of all , it will be interesting to understand how these phenomena depend on the number of particles , by understanding whether collective phenomena can occur .",
    "furthermore , heat spreading can be studied using our formalism , in order to see whether anomalous propagation regimes are possible or not because of the presence of @xmath0-body interactions . finally , the problem of how multipolar contributions influence the many - body coupling has to be addressed as well .",

    "in this section we discuss the derivation of the correlation functions of a fluctuating dipole at temperature @xmath6 given in eq .  .",
    "in particular , we justify the use of @xmath148 instead of the simpler factor @xmath88 typically used in literature .",
    "the quantity @xmath87 was already recently used in  @xcite , without providing a detailed derivation .",
    "the derivation of the correlation functions @xmath149 appearing in eq .   starts from the calculation of the correlation functions of the electric field emitted by the fluctuating dipole , demanding a careful use of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "the assumption of having bodies at fixed different temperatures out of thermal equilibrium is usually refereed to as local thermal equilibrium . starting from the pioneering work of polder and van hove  @xcite and rytov  @xcite this hypothesis is considered as equivalent to the statement that the field emitted by each body has the same statistical properties it would have if the body under scrutiny was at thermal equilibrium at its temperature .",
    "this issue is discussed in detail , for example , in several works presenting general theories for casimir force and heat transfer out of thermal equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "let us then consider a fluctuating dipole at temperature @xmath6 at thermal equilibrium .",
    "the definition of thermal equilibrium implies that the dipole _ must _ be immersed in a bath at the same temperature in such a way that the power radiated by the dipole equals the one absorbed from the bath .",
    "for this system the total field in any point of space is the sum of the one emitted by the dipole , the one coming from the bath , and the one scattered by the dipole .",
    "being at thermal equilibrium , the fluctuation - dissipation theorem can be directly applied to the total field .",
    "the correlation functions of the field coming from the bath , described as a free bosonic field , are known .",
    "since the connection between the induced dipole and the external field is established [ see eq .  ] , the scattered field is known as well .",
    "finally , the correlation functions of the emitted field can be deduced .",
    "this procedure is described in detail in  @xcite for an arbitrary body ( not necessarily in the dipolar approximation ) .",
    "the field emitted by the fluctuating dipole can then be written as @xmath150\\ ] ] where @xmath151 ( @xmath152 being the position of the dipole ) and @xmath153 represents the gradient with respect to @xmath154 .",
    "the result previously obtained and this last equation finally allows us to prove directly the dipolar correlation functions appearing in eq .  .",
    "we provide in this section the explicit expression of the @xmath55 in the case of one and two dipoles immersed in a thermal bath . for these two cases , we analytically show that the net absorbed power is zero at thermal equilibrium .",
    "in this case it follows immediately from eq .   that @xmath157 and then eq .   becomes @xmath158{\\text{tr}}(\\mathds{1})\\\\               & \\qquad-\\bigl[1 + 2n(\\omega , t_1)\\bigr]{\\text{im}}(\\alpha_1){\\text{tr}}(\\mathds{1})\\\\               &",

    "\\end{split}\\ ] ]    from this equation we clearly see that no net power is exchanged between the dipole and the bath for @xmath159 and we finally deduce the simple formula @xmath160 describing the spectral power density associated with the thermalization of a single dipole in a thermal bath .",
    "we now calculate eq .   for @xmath162 ( the case",
    "@xmath163 is equivalent ) .",
