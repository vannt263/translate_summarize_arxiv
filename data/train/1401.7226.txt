    "one of the earliest numerical indications of the possibility that an on - site electron - electron interaction @xmath1 might play a role in superconducting materials was the observation of a negative  binding energy \" in exact diagonalization studies of the hubbard hamiltonian on 2x2 clusters . in this geometry , the ground state energy of two holes doped together into a half - filled system was shown to be lower than if the two holes were on separate clusters : @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the ground state energy of @xmath10 holes .",
    "the observation that the @xmath11 and @xmath12 ground states have @xmath13- and @xmath14-wave symmetry , respectively , and hence are connected by a @xmath14-wave pair creation operator , suggested the possible relevance of models involving such 2x2 clusters with cuprate superconductors.@xcite pair binding was also studied on larger hubbard clusters,@xcite and on other geometries , e.g. , on one dimensional chains of varying length,@xcite with three electronic bands,@xcite models with intersite interactions,@xcite and the strong coupling @xmath0-@xmath15 limit.@xcite    following these small cluster studies , a considerable amount of analytic and numeric attention has been focused on the  plaquette hubbard model \" which consists of a periodic array of 2x2 plaquettes with hopping @xmath0 and repulsion @xmath1 connected by a weaker hybridization @xmath16 .",
    "it was suggested that the plaquettes act as centers of attraction , which then drive superconductivity in the extended lattice .",
    "this picture provides a ` local ' counterpart to theories of pairing which focus qualitatively on the exchange of magnetic fluctuations .",
    "perhaps unsurprisingly , the presence of inhomogeneous hoppings introduces phases to the mott insulator , antiferromagnetic , and @xmath14-wave superconductor typically discussed in the uniform @xmath17 case .",
    "specifically , the quantum numbers and symmetries of the 2x2 plaquette can evolve into a wide variety of ground states when @xmath16 is made nonzero.@xcite an additional diagonal hopping can also change the ground state of the 2x2 plaquette building block@xcite and induce types of crystalline insulators .",
    "the effects of both chemical potential and hopping disorder on pair binding have been examined,@xcite and were shown to be less damaging to superconductivity when there is a plaquette structure compared to the uniform case .",
    "a key conceptual question concerns the existence of an ` optimal inhomogeneity'.@xcite as pointed out by tsai and kivelson,@xcite pairing which exists at very weak @xmath16 is expected to exhibit a critical temperature @xmath18 which increases as @xmath16 grows .",
    "if it were the case that @xmath18 is small or zero in the homogeneous model @xmath19 , this necessarily implies a maximal @xmath18 at an intermediate value @xmath20 .",
    "early work relevant to this issue looked at pair binding energies when two plaquettes were linked in different geometries @xcite . for the cubic ( fully connected ) configuration ,",
    "a maximum binding was found for @xmath21 at @xmath3 and for @xmath22 when @xmath23 .",
    "exact diagonalization of 4x4 clusters@xcite indicated that the overall maximum occurs at @xmath22 and @xmath24 .",
    "additional evidence for an optimal inhomogeneity in the plaquette hubbard model is provided by a contractor - renormalization ( core ) study@xcite where the pair binding energy was found to be maximized in the range @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    in related work",
    ", the density matrix renormalization group method has been used to study a collection of 2x2 plaquettes connected to form a two leg ladder.@xcite it was found that , close to half - filling , @xmath27 and @xmath28 gives the optimal pair binding energy .",
    "although there can be no finite temperature transition in such one - dimensional ladder geometries , an interchain mean field theory suggests that the critical temperature again exhibits an ` optimal degree of inhomogeneity ' with a maximum occurring at @xmath29 .",
    "there have also been several methods which challenge the idea of an optimal inhomogeneity at intermediate @xmath5 .",
    "the central result of a dynamical cluster approximation ( dca ) analysis@xcite was that the critical temperature @xmath18 for @xmath14-wave pairing is maximal for @xmath30 for interaction strengths @xmath1 of the order of the bandwidth and lattice fillings @xmath31 .",
    "that is , inhomogeneity monotonically suppresses superconductivity .",
    "the qualitative physical picture behind this conclusion was that inhomogeneities reduce the magnetic contributions to the pairing interaction.@xcite    cellular dynamical mean field theory ( cdmft ) is another approach with which the plaquette hubbard hamiltonian has been analyzed.@xcite at weak coupling , inhomogeneity reduces the order parameter for small to intermediate doping , but enhances it at larger doping . for strong coupling",
    ", inhomogeneity suppresses pairing for all doping .",
    "overall , the cdmft results seem generally consistent with those of the dca , namely that for inhomogeneity in the nearest - neighbor hopping such as is present in the plaquette hubbard model , the superconducting order parameter does not exceed that of the uniform system .",
    "the contrasting results between the dmrg interchain mft , core , and exact diagonalization treatments , and other cases in which optimal inhomogeneity occurs , on one hand , and the dca , cdmft methods on the other , provide the motivation for the work described in this manuscript - a study of the plaquette hubbard hamiltonian@xcite using the determinant quantum monte carlo method.@xcite after presenting our results , we will discuss some of the possible origins of the range of conclusions concerning the underlying physics of this model .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we write down the plaquette hubbard hamiltonian and discuss the measurements we use to monitor @xmath14-wave pairing .",
    "we also provide a brief summary of the dqmc algorithm and its limitations . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss our results at half - filling and in the doped case .",
    "our central conclusion is that an optimal degree of inhomogeneity does occur in the plaquette hubbard model , although the largest pairing signal appears to occur at @xmath4 for @xmath3 , a bit less than that reported in other work .",
    "this optimal @xmath5 increases with @xmath6 at half - filling .",
    "the sign problem restricts us to higher temperatures than those accessible in the dca@xcite and cdmft@xcite approaches .",
    "section iv discusses the effect on pairing of another form of inhomogeneity in which the site energies are varied periodically across the lattice , and sec .",
    "v concerns the sign problem .",
    "the paper concludes with a summary of our findings .",

    "the designations @xmath36 and @xmath37 in the kinetic energy terms convey the fact that hopping @xmath0 between near neighbor sites @xmath38 on the same plaquette is different from the hopping @xmath16 for sites @xmath38 on different plaquettes . this geometry is illustrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : geometries ] . we have written the interaction term in particle - hole symmetric form , so that @xmath39 corresponds to half - filling .",
    "( note that the hubbard hamiltonian with near - neighbor hopping on a bipartite lattice is particle - hole symmetric for _ any _ pattern of intersite hoppings @xmath40 , and hence , in particular , for the case considered here . )",
    "although we have referred to @xmath16 as the ` interplaquette hopping ' , so that @xmath41 is the limit of independent 2x2 clusters , we note that setting @xmath42 also results in a collection of decoupled 2x2 @xmath16 clusters . more generally , the hamiltonian is invariant@xcite under the interchange of @xmath0 and @xmath16 . as a consequence , there is no need to explore the physics of @xmath43 .",
    "the hamiltonian is also invariant when the values of @xmath0 and @xmath16 are interchanged only on the horizontal links , or only on the vertical links .",
    "our numerical approach preserves all these symmetries .    in the determinant quantum monte carlo ( dqmc ) algorithm @xcite , the expectation values of observables @xmath44 for fermonic hamiltonians like eq .",
    "[ eq : plaquetteham ] are evaluated by discretizing the inverse temperature @xmath45 and rewriting the partition function as a path integral .",
    "replacing the exponential of the interaction terms in the hamiltonian by a coupling of quadratic fermion operators to a hubbard - stratonovich field allows the fermions to be integrated out analytically , leaving a product of fermion determinants ( one determinant for each spin species ) as the weight to sample the hubbard - stratonovich field .",
    "each operator @xmath46 can then be measured by accumulating appropriate combinations of green s functions , the inverse of the matrices whose determinants form the boltzmann weight . as described further below , the flexibility to alter the order in which the monte carlo average is performed and",
    "in which the green s functions are multiplied can be used to control which many body effects are included in the expectation value , and hence to isolate the pairing vertex .",
    "the discretization of @xmath45 introduces a ` trotter error ' .",
    "we have used @xmath47 in the work reported here@xcite . in practice , unless one examines a local quantity like the energy or double occupancy which can be obtained to very high accuracy , the systematic trotter errors with this choice of @xmath48 are less than the statistical errors in the measurements we present .",
    "the central limitation to the dqmc algorithm is the sign problem@xcite which arises when the product of determinants becomes negative .",
    "this will restrict the temperatures accessible in the study reported here , and , as a consequence , temper our ability to make conclusive statements about the effect of inhomogeneity in the case when the system is doped . at",
    "half - filling , because spatial variations in the hopping do not destroy particle - hole symmetry , there is no sign problem and dqmc can better access the ground state for any @xmath5 . off half - filling data for the average sign @xmath49 are given in fig .",

    "it is possible to get accurate data for certain quantities , like the density , for quite small values of @xmath49 .",
    "however for more complex quantities like magnetic and pair correlations at large distances , if reasonable accuracy ( statistical error bars less than 10% ) is desired , then @xmath51 is needed .",

    "the spectrum of the @xmath56 hopping hamiltonian for an isolated 2x2 plaquette consists of four energy levels , @xmath57 .",

    "figure [ fig : rhovsmutp02l8 ] shows qmc data for @xmath64 at interaction strengths @xmath65 and @xmath3 and weakly coupled plaquettes @xmath66 .",
    "there is a band gap evident at @xmath62 ( and also , due to particle - hole symmetry at @xmath63 , not shown ) .",
    "non - zero @xmath6 is also seen to cause an insulating gap to develop at half - filling , @xmath67 .",
    "this is a dramatic change from the noninteracting limit , since it represents the suppression of the large peak in @xmath58 at @xmath68 in fig .",
    "[ fig : noninteractingdos ] .",
    "the development of this gap , even though @xmath6 is much less than the bandwidth , is associated with the onset of long range antiferromagnetic order , as we shall see in the next section .",

    "this , however , is not true for more complicated spin and pair correlations .    the equal time spin correlation function and magnetic structure factor are given by , @xmath70 with an analogous expression for @xmath71 .",

    "thus this model makes partial contact with earlier studies of binding on cuo@xmath7 clusters in the limit @xmath155.@xcite another point of contact of this model is to other inhomogeneity patterns which share an @xmath151 proportion of sites with raised on - site energy , for example [ ] in which a pattern of stripes was shown to enhance @xmath14-wave pairing away from half - filling .",

    "[ fig : gammapdnvrho0774and0875p4](b ) , the same quantity but with @xmath52 .",
    "this data is consistent with the previous density , and we conclude that this form of site energy inhomogeneity competes destructively with superconductivity .    finally , we consider a pattern of inhomogeneity with @xmath152 .",

    "we return here briefly to the sign problem which is the fundamental limitation to using dqmc to study lattice fermion hamiltonians @xcite . in generic situations ( that is , in the absence of particle - hole or some other symmetry which makes the sign positive )",
    "the fermion sign @xmath156 is well - behaved down to some temperature scale @xmath157 , where @xmath158 depends , in the single band hubbard model , on @xmath1 and @xmath159 .",
    "below this temperature , @xmath156 decays exponentially with @xmath160 so that simulations are feasible only in a very narrow range of temperatures below the point at which some of the fermion determinants begin to go negative .",
    "@xmath156 also decays exponentially with spatial volume @xmath161 , but in practice the @xmath45 dependence is usually more problematic .",
    "the behavior of @xmath156 with @xmath159 and spatial geometry is also affected by ` shell effects',@xcite so that the sign can remain close to unity for fillings for which multiple @xmath162 points have the same non - interacting energy @xmath163 .",
    "the plaquette hubbard hamiltonian offers a window into this @xmath161 dependence , since it must be rigorously true at @xmath87 that @xmath164 .",

    "however , when the clusters are coupled , @xmath167 ( bottom panel ) , the average sign is increased .",
    "while the improvement in the behavior of @xmath156 is not sufficient to allow ground state properties to be obtained , it is nevertheless intriguing , and non - trivial , that the entanglement of the clusters by hopping @xmath16 here reduces the sign problem : the coefficient @xmath168 of the exponential decay @xmath169 changes from @xmath170 , at @xmath171 , to @xmath172 , at @xmath167 .",
    "study of the effect of inhomogeneities on superconductivity has been a focus of much computational effort on the hubbard and @xmath173 models over the last decade .",
    "one branch of effort has explored models where inhomogeneity is included in the hamiltonian itself .",
    "other work concerns the question of inhomogeneity which arises spontaneously in a translationally invariant hamiltonian .",
    "the plaquette hubbard model has been a natural candidate of interest since it seems to contain the nascent element , a substantial binding energy , in its building blocks .",
    "we have shown here that dqmc indicates that a sensitive measurement of @xmath14-wave pairing yields an ` optimal degree of inhomogeneity ' .",
    "that is @xmath90 is closer to @xmath91 at @xmath92 when @xmath3 than at @xmath174 or @xmath175 .",
    "larger @xmath6 lead to larger optimal @xmath5 for the @xmath176 range studied .",
    "this result agrees qualitatively with some past numeric work ( differing in the precise optimal @xmath5 ) , but is in disagreement with several of the most powerful computational methods available for these sorts of problems .",
    "when simulations are conducted directly on doped lattices , our work clearly shows the existence of an optimal inhomogeneity , which develops further as @xmath121 is lowered .",

    "direct simulations of the doped system would , of course , be preferable , especially since this effective doping is system size dependent .",
    "nevertheless , comparisons of data for different @xmath180 and ( large ) @xmath93 on lattices of _ fixed _ size are possible . in this way ,",
    "our low temperature , half - filled results speak to the issue of the role of inhomogeneity .",
    "simulations of an alternative ` checkerboard hubbard model ' show that the attractive d - wave vertex is not generic .",
    "a different pattern of spatial inhomogeneity produced a repulsive vertex for most parameter regimes of this second hamiltonian .",
    "we have also exploited the ability to decouple the model spatially to obtain data on the sign problem as independent ( @xmath87 ) spatial clusters are coupled .",
    "we find that the average sign is increased by finite @xmath5 .",
    "we conclude this paper with a few remarks concerning the results from different numerical methods .",
    "our dqmc results are most consistent with the exact diagonalization@xcite , dmrg@xcite , and core@xcite treatments , indicating the existence of an optimal degree of inhomogeneity . as is well known , what makes the problem of strong correlation so challenging is the competition between different possible ordered ( or disordered ) states at low temperature which are close in energy .",
    "even small approximations in analytic and numeric treatments can tip the balance in these near - degeneracies .",
    "dqmc treats the correlated electron problem exactly on lattices of finite size . here",
    ", we are exploring a superconducting mechanism which explicitly attributes pairing to a spatially local attraction , as opposed to the exchange of lattice vibrations or spin waves .",
    "in such a situation it is plausible that finite size effects , while still present , might be less strong .",
