    "low - mass star formation typically involves the collapse of a dense core inside a molecular cloud to form a condensed central object and an extended disk .",
    "the protostar gains much of its mass by accretion of disk material , which can only proceed if there is some mechanism for removing angular momentum from the accreting material .",
    "protostars that are actively accreting disk material frequently exhibit associated bipolar outflows in the form of collimated jets oriented perpendicular to the disk , stretching out over distances much larger than the radial scale of the disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this association between accretion disks and large - scale , collimated jets is also seen in other systems , including x - ray binaries and active galactic nuclei . the strongest candidate mechanism for launching jets in these systems",
    "is described by the magnetocentrifugal disk wind model ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bp82 ) , which relies on the acceleration of a fraction of disk material out along a large - scale , ordered magnetic field threading the disk at a sufficiently small inclination angle",
    ". this magnetic field could be the interstellar field in the parent molecular cloud that is dragged in during core collapse , or it could be generated by dynamo activity in the disk or the star .",
    "a natural consequence of the disk wind model is that the wind efficiently removes angular momentum from the disk material , which could explain the strong inferred link between accretion and outflow phenomena in protostars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "several previous semianalytic studies have matched solutions of the equations of non - ideal mhd that describe a weakly ionized , magnetized accretion disk , and solutions of the equations of cold , ideal mhd for a polytropic fluid that describe a bp82-type magnetocentrifugal wind that removes all the disk s excess angular momentum .",
    "these models focused on a radially localized portion of the disk ( e.g. , @xcite , hereafter wk93 ; @xcite , hereafter skw07 ; @xcite , hereafter skw11 ) , or on a global disk model ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter l96 ; @xcite , hereafter f97 ) based on the same assumption of self - similarity in spherical radius that underlies the bp82 wind model .",
    "another approach is presented in @xcite , where the thinness of the disk is used to justify solutions for the disk structure that are separable in the radial and vertical coordinates ; these solutions are matched to an isothermal wind .",
    "a key parameter in determining whether a disk can launch a magnetocentrifugal wind is the field line inclination angle at the disk surface @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the radial and vertical field components at the disk surface ( subscript ` s ' ) .",
    "this inclination angle is determined by the flux distribution along the disk surface and can only be calculated in a self - consistent fashion in a global treatment ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ol01 ) .",
    "a second key parameter describing the interaction of the disk and wind is @xmath3 , the azimuthal field strength at the disk surface , which sets the torque exerted by the wind on the disk ( bp82 ) . as with the surface field inclination angle ,",
    "the value of @xmath3 is determined by processes acting outside the disk ; specifically , the value of @xmath3 is determined by the constraint that the wind solution pass smoothly through the alfvn point .",
    "accretion flows in a weakly ionized disk will drag in magnetic flux , opposing the natural tendency of the magnetic flux to diffuse outwards .",
    "studies of accretion disks that shed angular momentum due to mhd turbulence developed from the magnetorotational instability ( mri , @xcite ) suggest that the magnetic diffusivity and the effective viscosity of such disks are comparable @xcite , agreeing with previous work by @xcite which suggested that the magnetic diffusivity of mri - active accretion disks may be too large to allow efficient inward dragging of magnetic flux .",
    "this problem can be overcome in an mri - active disk threaded by a large - scale field that removes angular momentum from surface layers in which the mri is suppressed @xcite .",
    "more generally , this problem disappears if the angular momentum transport mechanism is decoupled from the mechanism that provides the magnetic diffusivity so that the diffusivity is much smaller than the effective viscosity of the disk .",
    "this occurs naturally in a disk from which angular momentum is removed through a magnetocentrifugal wind , allowing magnetic flux to be dragged in and distributed over a wind - driving disk .",
    "as noted by ol01 , the evolution of the magnetic flux through the disk determines whether magnetic configurations capable of launching outflows can be maintained over the accretion timescale .",
    "previous studies of wind - driving disks have not treated the effects of magnetic flux evolution in a self - consistent manner : in a local model , ol01 calculated the rate of flux migration given @xmath1 and @xmath3 , which were free parameters .",
    "the local models of @xcite expressed @xmath3 and the surface field inclination angle in terms of unconstrained parameters that describe the structure of the disk and the processes operating within it .",
    "wk93 also employed a local model in which they determined @xmath3 self - consistently using the alfvn point constraint , but left the surface field inclination angle unconstrained , describing the magnetic flux migration speed using the free parameter @xmath4 .",
    "the global models of l96 and f97 also solved for @xmath3 using the alfvn point constraint but left the surface field inclination angle and magnetic flux migration unconstrained , essentially setting @xmath5 . for an overview of recent work on semianalytic models and complementary numerical simulations of protostellar jets ,",
    "see the article by @xcite .",
    "i present here a new , semianalytic , radially self - similar , global model that matches disk solutions with bp82-type wind solutions , adopting an approach similar to that of l96 but including for the first time a fully self - consistent calculation of the effects of magnetic flux migration and the magnetic field structure above the disk : @xmath4 , @xmath1 , @xmath6 and @xmath0 are no longer free parameters but are determined by physical constraints imposed at the disk surface and at critical points of the outflow . in addition , the equations describing the disk are formulated in terms of the conductivity tensor , allowing for fully general non - ideal disk models .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section  [ form ]",
    "i review the equations describing a ( nearly ) steady - state , axisymmetric , weakly ionized disk threaded by a magnetic field , and i show how the system reduces to a set of ordinary differential equations under the radial self - similarity assumption . in section  [ paramconstr",
    "] i discuss constraints from the self - consistent treatment of the field - line inclination at the top of the disk and from matching disk and wind solutions . in section  [ res ]",
    "i present a representative matched disk / wind solution , and in section  [ concs ] i summarize the study and outline plans to improve on the current model .",
    "i consider a weakly ionized , geometrically thin , vertically isothermal , axisymmetric disk in near - keplerian rotation around a protostar of mass @xmath7 that is threaded by an ordered , large - scale magnetic field .",
    "i examine the general , non - ideal mhd case ( section  [ casegen ] ) , expressing the matter  field interaction using the conductivity tensor formalism , and seek solutions that are steady on timescales shorter than the accretion time ( section  [ goveqgen ] ) .",
    "i follow l96 and f97 in making the simplifying assumption of radial self - similarity to produce a global disk / wind model ( section  [ selfgen ] ) , and i derive the midplane values of various physical quantities ( section  [ midgen ] ) .    in section  [ casead ]",
    "i specialize to the case of the ambipolar conductivity regime .",
    "i once again derive the relevant self - similar disk equations ( section  [ selfad ] ) and the midplane values for the variables of integration ( section  [ midad ] ) .",
    "the interiors of protostellar disks have a low ionization fraction , necessitating the use of non - ideal mhd to describe the behavior of the disk material in the presence of a large - scale magnetic field that is assumed to thread the disk .",
    "the non - ideal matter - field interaction can be described using a multi - fluid approach or by introducing the conductivity tensor ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which encapsulates the response of the dominant neutral fluid to the presence of the magnetic field .",
    "the effects of the magnetic field are communicated to the neutrals by the development of charge ",
    "neutral drift velocities due to the lorentz forces on charged species , and the consequent systematic charge ",
    "neutral drag forces . under the conductivity tensor formalism , this is expressed in the generalized version of ohm s law , @xmath8    where @xmath9@xmath10 is the electric field in a frame comoving with the dominant neutral fluid , @xmath9@xmath11 and @xmath9@xmath12 are the components of @xmath9@xmath10 parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field , respectively , and @xmath13is the conductivity tensor . the components of @xmath13are the ohm conductivity @xmath14 , the hall conductivity @xmath15 , and the pedersen conductivity @xmath16 .    for a given charged species ( denoted by subscript",

    "neutral collisional drag coefficient of species @xmath17 , and @xmath23 is the neutral mass density .",
    "the signed value of the ratio of the gyrofrequency and neutral collision frequency is the hall parameter ,    @xmath24    the definition of the hall parameter uses the signed value of the magnetic field strength , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the @xmath27 component of the magnetic field in cylindrical coordinates @xmath28 , so that the hall conductivity retains its dependence on the magnetic field polarity ( see equation ( [ eq : sigmahall ] ) ) .",
    "large values @xmath29 imply that charged species @xmath17 is tightly coupled to the magnetic field , whereas small values @xmath30 imply that species @xmath17 is weakly coupled to the field .",
    "the conductivity tensor components can be expressed in terms of the hall parameters as    @xmath31    @xmath32    and    @xmath33    note that since @xmath34 is the signed value of the magnetic field strength , the hall conductivity can be positive or negative .",
    "the factor of @xmath34 in @xmath35 cancels the pre - factor of @xmath36 in the expressions for the ohm and pedersen conductivities , which are positive regardless of the magnetic field orientation .",
    "the coupling of the neutral matter to the magnetic field is described by the elsasser number @xmath37 , given by @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the alfvn speed , @xmath40 is the keplerian angular frequency , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . as with the hall parameter ,",
    "large values @xmath43 imply that the neutral matter is strongly coupled to the magnetic field , whereas small values @xmath44 imply that the neutral matter is only weakly coupled to the magnetic field . launching a magnetocentrifugal wind typically requires strong neutral  field coupling ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the governing equations for the disk are the continuity of mass , @xmath46 and the conservation of momentum , @xmath47 in these equations , @xmath48is the neutral gas velocity and @xmath49 is its pressure , where @xmath50 is the isothermal speed of sound .",
    "the gravitational potential of the central object is given by @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the spherical radius and @xmath53 is the keplerian rotation speed .",
    "within the disk , the ionization fraction is very low , which implies that the equations of momentum conservation for the charged species are dominated by the charge ",
    "neutral drag force and the lorentz force ( cf .",
    "equations 2.152.17 in wk93 ) .",
    "we can thus replace the charge  neutral drag force with the lorentz force ; this substitution has already been made in the conservation of momentum for the neutral disk material ( equation ( [ eq : moment ] ) ) .",
    "the current density satisfies ampre s law ( neglecting the displacement current ) @xmath54    and ohm s law ( equation ( [ eq : ohm ] ) ) , with the comoving electric field @xmath9@xmath10 related to the inertial - frame electric field",
    "@xmath9by @xmath55    the magnetic field satisfies the solenoidal condition @xmath56 and the electric field @xmath9satisfies the induction equation , @xmath57    or , in terms of the comoving electric field , @xmath58 in a strictly steady state , @xmath59 identically .",
    "however , the magnetic flux threading the disk interior to a fixed radius @xmath60 can change on the accretion timescale due to advection of field lines by the accretion flow and diffusion of field lines through the non - ideal disk material .",
    "i therefore consider disk solutions that are steady on timescales longer than the dynamic time @xmath61 but relax the steady - state assumption on timescales comparable to the accretion time @xmath62 .    expanding equation ( [ eq : induct3 ] ) yields @xmath63 @xmath64 and @xmath65    where the solenoidal condition ( equation ( [ eq : solen ] ) ) was used to obtain equation ( [ eq : inductphi ] ) .",
    "now , @xmath66 , @xmath67 through much of the disk and @xmath68 near the top of the disk ( see figure 2 ) , @xmath69 ( where @xmath70 is the tidal scale height ) , and @xmath71 .",
    "these relations imply that the terms @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 in equation ( [ eq : inductr ] ) describe processes operating on the dynamic timescale .",

    ", every term in equation ( [ eq : inductz ] ) describes a process that operates on the longer accretion timescale .",
    "i therefore ignore @xmath84 and @xmath85 in the @xmath60 and @xmath86 components of the induction equation , since those terms represent changes in the magnetic field on the accretion timescale and are negligible compared with the terms representing changes in the magnetic field on the dynamic timescale , but i retain @xmath87 in the @xmath27 component of the induction equation ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "the components of equation ( [ eq : induct ] ) thus become @xmath88    @xmath89    and @xmath90 the @xmath60 and @xmath27 components of the induction equation together imply that @xmath91 is constant with height at a given @xmath60 but need not vanish identically .",
    "the disk equations reduce from partial to ordinary differential equations under the assumption of radial self - similarity , which implies that all quantities are described by power laws in the spherical radius @xmath92 for a fixed inclination angle .",
