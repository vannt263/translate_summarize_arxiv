    "the perovskite oxide lanio@xmath13 , purportedly an example of a correlated metallic ni@xmath14 system , has been investigated over some decades by a few groups@xcite for possible exotic behavior .",
    "the oxygen - poor lanthanum nickelate lanio@xmath15 has also attracted attention , because of characteristic changes of its electronic and magnetic properties as the oxygens are removed .",
    "it is metallic at @xmath16 , but semiconducting for @xmath17.@xcite for @xmath18 , it shows ferromagnetic ordering with 1.7 @xmath19/ni below 230 k @xcite and magnetic behavior of the @xmath20 material has been interpreted in terms of a model of ferromagnetic clusters.@xcite at @xmath21 , where formally the ni is divalent , a perovskite - type compound la@xmath0ni@xmath0o@xmath22 forms in which nio@xmath23 octahedra lie along @xmath24 axis directed chains and nio@xmath25 square - planar units alternate in the @xmath26 plane .",
    "this compound shows antiferromagnetic ordering of the nio@xmath23 units along the @xmath24 axis but no magnetic ordering of the nio@xmath25 units.@xcite    since lanio@xmath0 with formally monovalent ni ions was synthesized by crespin _",
    "et al._@xcite it has attracted interest@xcite because it is isostructural to cacuo@xmath0,@xcite the parent  infinite layer \" material of high t@xmath27 superconductors , and like cacuo@xmath0 has a formal @xmath28 ion amongst closed ionic shells . however , it is difficult to synthesize and was not revisited experimentally until recently by hayward @xmath29 who produced it as the major phase by oxygen deintercalation from lanio@xmath13.@xcite their materials consist of two phases , the majority being the infinite - layer ( nio@xmath0-la - nio@xmath0 ) structure and the minority being a disordered derivative phase .",
    "magnetization and neutron powder diffraction reveal no long - range magnetic order in their materials .",
    "its paramagnetic susceptibility has been fit by a curie - weiss form in the @xmath30 range with s=@xmath31 and weiss constant @xmath32 = -257 k , but its low t behavior varies strongly from this form .",
    "more recently , this same group has produced the isostructural and isovalent nickelate ndnio@xmath0.@xcite    one of the most striking features of lanio@xmath0 is that it potentially provides a structurally simple example of a _ monovalent open shell transition metal d@xmath33 ion_. except for the divalent cu@xmath11 ion , the d@xmath33 configuration is practically nonexistent in ionic solids . in particular , the formal similarity of ni@xmath34 and cu@xmath11",
    "suggests that ni@xmath34 compounds might provide a  platform \" for additional high temperature superconductors .",
    "it is these and related questions that we address here .    in this paper we present results of theoretical studies of the electronic and magnetic structures of lanio@xmath0 , and compare with the case of cacuo@xmath0 ( or isovalent ca@xmath35sr@xmath15cuo@xmath0 ) which is well characterized .",
    "a central question in transition metal oxides is the role of correlation effects , which are certainly not known _ a priori _ in lanio@xmath0 .",
    "we look at results both from the local density approximation ( lda ) and its magnetic generalization , and then apply also the lda+u correlated electron band theory that accounts in a self - consistent mean - field way for hubbard - like intraatomic repulsion characterized by the strength u. our results reveal very different behavior between lanio@xmath0 and cacuo@xmath0 , in spite of the structural and formal @xmath28 charge similarities .",
    "the differences can be traced to ( 1 ) the difference in @xmath7 site energy between ni and cu relative to that of cu , ( 2 ) the ionic charge difference between ca@xmath11 and la@xmath14 and associated madelung potential shifts , and ( 3 ) the participation of cation @xmath6 states in lanio@xmath0 .",
    "we also discuss briefly our discovery of anomalous behavior in the transition metal @xmath1 ion as described by lda+u at large u. although well beyond the physical range of u for lanio@xmath0 , we find that lda+u produces what might be characterized as a @xmath36  singlet \" ion in which the internal configuration is one @xmath8 hole with spin up and one @xmath9 hole with spin down , corresponding to an extreme spin - density anisotropy on the transition metal ion but ( nearly ) vanishing net moment .",
    "in the samples of lanio@xmath0 synthesized and reported by hayward @xmath37 @xmath38 , there exist two phases with space group @xmath39 ( no . 123 ) but different site symmetry.@xcite we focus on the majority infinite - layer phase , which is isostructural with cacuo@xmath0.@xcite in the crystal structure shown in fig .",
    "1 , ni ions are at the corners of the square and la ions lie at the center of unit cell .",
    "the bond length of ni - o is 1.979 @xmath40 , about 2% more than that of cu - o in cacuo@xmath0 ( 1.93 @xmath40 ) .",
    "we used the lattice constants @xmath41,@xcite with a ( @xmath42 ) supercell space group @xmath43 ( no .",
    "139 ) for afm calculations .",
    "the calculations were carried out with the full - potential nonorthogonal local - orbital ( fplo ) method@xcite and a regular mesh containing 196 @xmath44 points in the irreducible wedge of the brillouin zone .",
    "valence orbitals for the basis set were la @xmath45 , ni @xmath46 , o @xmath47 .",
    "as frequently done when studying transition metal oxides , we have tried both of the popular forms of functional@xcite of lda+u method@xcite with a wide range of on - site coulomb interaction u from 1 to 8 ev , but the intra - atomic exchange integral j=1 ev was left unchanged . for cacuo@xmath0",
    ", we used the same conditions as the previous calculation done by eschrig @xmath37 @xmath48 using fplo.@xcite",
    "we present first the lda results .",
    "the paramagnetic ( pm ) band structure with its energy scale relative to fermi energy @xmath49 is given in fig .",
    "a complex of la @xmath50 bands is located at + 2.5 ev with bandwidth less than 1 ev . the o @xmath51 bands extend from about -8 ev to -3.2 ev .",
    "the ni @xmath52 bands are distributed from -3 ev to 2 ev , with the localized @xmath53 complex near -1.5 ev , while the broad la @xmath54 states range from -0.2 ev to 8 ev . unlike in pm cacuo@xmath0 , there are two bands crossing e@xmath55 .",
    "one is like the canonical @xmath8 derived band in the cuprates , rather broad due to the strong @xmath56 antibonding interaction with oxygen @xmath57 states and enclosing holes centered at the m point .",
    "the other band , lying at -0.2 ev at @xmath58 and also having its maximum at the m=(@xmath59 point , is a mixture of la @xmath60 states and some ni @xmath61 character .",
    "already this band indicates importance of ni @xmath7 - la @xmath6 band mixing .",

    "3 can be reproduced with a few hopping amplitudes , but requiring more than might have been anticipated .",
    "the site energy is @xmath72 mev , slightly above the fermi level , and the hopping integrals ( in mev ) are @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 . there is no hopping along the ( 101 ) direction .",
    "as anticipated from the cuprates , the largest hopping is via @xmath65 .",
    "however , to correctly describe the @xmath77 dispersion from x - r ( _ i.e. _ along @xmath78 ) together with the _ lack of dispersion _ from @xmath58 - z ( @xmath79 ) and also",
    "m - a ( @xmath80 ) , the third neighbor hopping terms @xmath69 must be included .",
    "the comparison of the single band tight binding parameters with those of cacuo@xmath0 is given in table i. it should be noted that the state in mind is an @xmath81 symmetry state that is orthogonal to those on neighboring ni / cu ions , i.e. an @xmath81 symmetry wannier orbital . in ni ,",
    "the on - site energy is 0.3 ev above what it is in cacuo@xmath0 , lying above e@xmath55 rather than below .",
    "this difference is partially due to the different madelung potential in the two differently - charged compounds , but it also reflects some intrinsic hole - doping in the nickelate that leads to a lower fermi level . the largest hopping amplitude ( the conventional _ t _ ) is 71% of its value in the cuprate , while the second ( _ t _ ) is essentially the same . the @xmath82 is also 70% of its value in the cuprate , while the other amplitudes are the almost unchanged .",
    "the lda fermi surfaces are shown in fig .",
    "4 . as for the cuprates ,",
    "the fermi surface is dominated by the m - centered hole barrel . in this system",
    "neighboring barrels touch at r=(@xmath83 ) because the saddle point at r happens to lie at e@xmath55 .",
    "the fermi surfaces also include two spheres containing electrons .",
    "the sphere at @xmath58 , with mixed ni and la @xmath84 character , contains about @xmath85 electrons .",
    "the a - centered sphere is mainly ni @xmath86 in character and contains approximately 0.07 electrons per ni .",
    "the barrel , whose radius of @xmath87 in the ( 1,1,@xmath77 ) direction is almost independent of @xmath77 but which varies along ( 1,0,@xmath77 ) , possesses about 1.1 holes , accounting for the total of the @xmath88 hole that is required by luttinger s theorem and also fits the formal ni@xmath34 valence ( which , being a metal and also mixing with la as well as with o states , is not very relevant ) .    to investigate magnetic tendencies , attempts to find both ferromagnetic ( fm ) and antiferromagnetic ( afm ) states were made .",
    "a stable @xmath42 afm state was obtained , with spin moment 0.53 @xmath19 per ni .",
    "this state has lower energy by @xmath89 mev / ni than that of pm state .",
    "just as for the paramagnetic case , the afm state has entangled bands of la @xmath54 , ni @xmath52 and o @xmath51 character near the fermi energy .",
    "in contrast to the unpolarized case ( and cacuo@xmath0 ) , with afm order the large electron pocket has primarily la @xmath10 character and the slightly occupied electron pocket at @xmath58 has a combination of la @xmath5 and ni @xmath4 character . attempts to obtain",
    "a fm solution always led to a vanishing moment .",
    "as noted in the introduction , no magnetic order has been observed in lanio@xmath0 , either by magnetization or by neutron scattering .",
    "although the local density approximation often does quite well in predicting magnetic moments , for weakly or nearly magnetic systems renormalization by spin fluctuations becomes important@xcite and such effects are not included in the local density approximation .",
    "there is also the question of the strength of correlation effects due to an intra - atomic repulsion @xmath12 on the ni site .",
    "analogy to cacuo@xmath0 ( same formal @xmath28 configuration , neighboring ion in the periodic table ) , which is a strong antiferromagnetic insulator , suggests that effects due to @xmath12 might have some importance .",
    "here we apply the lda+u `` correlated band theory '' method to assess effects of intra - atomic repulsion and compare with observed behavior . in the following subsection",
    "we compare and contrast with cacuo@xmath0 .    upon increasing @xmath12 from zero in the antiferromagnetically",
    "ordered phase , the spin magnetic moment of ni increases from the lda value of 0.53 @xmath19 to a maximum of 0.8 @xmath90 at @xmath91 ev .",
    "surprisingly , for @xmath92 4 ev the moment steadily decreases and by @xmath93 ev it has",
    "_ dropped _ to 0.2 @xmath90/ni , which is less than half of its lda value .",
    "we emphasize that this behavior is unrelated to the observed behavior of lanio@xmath0 ( which may need little or no additional correlation beyond lda ) .",
    "however , this unprecedented response of the transition metal ion to the imposition of a large @xmath12 gives new insight into a feature of the lda+u method that has not been observed previously .",
    "this `` quenching '' of the local moment with increasing @xmath12 results from behavior of ni @xmath4 states that is analogous to those of the @xmath71 , but with the direction of spin inverted ( then with additional complications ) . as usual for a @xmath28 ion in this environment ,",
    "the majority @xmath71 state of ni is fully occupied even at @xmath94 ev , while the minority state is completely unoccupied at @xmath91 ev , where the moment is maximum and the system is essentially ni@xmath34 s=@xmath31 .",
    "one can characterize this situation as a mott insulating @xmath71 orbital , as in the undoped cuprates . at @xmath12 = 3 ev",
    ", the density of states has a quasi one - dimensional van hove singularity due to a flat band just below ( bordering ) the fermi energy as can be seen in the @xmath7 dos shown in fig .",
    "[ 2mott ] . upon increasing @xmath12 to 4 ev , rather than reinforcing the @xmath95 configuration of ni and thereby forcing the la and o ions to cope with electron / hole doping , the ni @xmath9 states begin to polarize . the charge on the ni ion drops somewhat , moving it in the ni@xmath34 @xmath96 ni@xmath11 direction , with the charge going into the la @xmath6  o @xmath97 states",
    ". idealizing a bit , one might characterize the movement of ( unoccupied ) _ majority _ character of @xmath4 well above e@xmath55 as a mott transition of these orbitals , which is not only _ distinct from _ that of the @xmath71 states , but is _ oppositely _ directed , leading to an on - site `` singlet '' type of cancellation .",
    "this movement of states with increasing @xmath12 has been emphasized in fig . [",
    "2mott ] for easier visualization . the resulting spin density on the transition metal ion at @xmath12 = 8 ev is pictured in fig .",
    "[ spindens ] .",
    "there is strong polarization in all directions from the core except for the position of nodes .",
    "the polarization is strongly positive ( majority ) in the lobes of the @xmath71 orbital , and just as strongly negative ( minority spin ) in the lobes of the @xmath4 orbital .",
    "the net moment is ( nearly ) vanishing , but this results from a singlet combination ( as nearly as it can be represented within classical spin picture ) of spin - half up in one orbital and spin - half down in another orbital that violates hund s first rule .",
    "the magnetization density is large throughout the ion , but integrates to ( nearly ) zero .",
    "this behavior is however more complicated than a mott splitting of occupied and unoccupied state , as can be seen from the substantial ni @xmath7 character that remains , even for @xmath12 = 8 ev , in a band straddling e@xmath55 while the rest of the weight moves to @xmath984 ev .",
    "in both of these bands there is strong mixing with la @xmath10 states .",
    "what happens is that as the `` upper hubbard @xmath4 band '' rises as @xmath12 is increased , it progressively mixes more strongly with the la @xmath10 states , forming a bonding band and an antibonding band .",
    "while the antibonding combination continues to move upward with increasing @xmath12 , the bonding combination forms a half - filled band which remains at e@xmath55 .",
    "thus we have found that for the ni@xmath34 ion in this environment , increasing @xmath12 ( well beyond what is physically plausible for lanio@xmath0 ) results in @xmath95 ni@xmath99 being converted into a nominal ni@xmath100 ion ( the actual charge changes little , however ) in which the two holes are coupled into an intraatomic @xmath101 singlet .",
    "this behavior involves yet a new kind of correlation between the @xmath102 states and the @xmath103 states , but one which is due to ( driven by ) the local environment .",
    "this behavior is quite different from the results for @xmath12=8 ev reported by anisimov , bukhvalov and rice@xcite using the stuttgart tblmto-47 code .",
    "they obtained an afm insulating solution analogous to that obtained for cacuo@xmath0,@xcite with a single hole in the @xmath7 shell occupying the @xmath71 orbital that antibonds with the neighboring oxygen @xmath104 orbital .",
    "the reason for this different result is not known , but it is now well established that multiple solutions to the lda+u equations often exist.@xcite",
    "although ni@xmath99 is isoelectronic to cu@xmath100 , both the observed and the calculated behavior of lanio@xmath0 are very different from cacuo@xmath0 .",
    "in contrast to cacuo@xmath0 , lanio@xmath0 is ( apparently ) metallic , with no experimental evidence of magnetic ordering for lanio@xmath0 .",
    "the differing electronic and magnetic properties mainly arise from two factors .",
    "first , the ca @xmath52 bands lying in the range of 4 ev and 9 ev are very differently distributed from the broader and lower la @xmath54 bands in the range of -0.2 ev and 8 ev .",
    "secondly , in cacuo@xmath0 , o @xmath51 states extend to fermi level and overlap strongly with cu @xmath52 states , and the difference of the two centers is less than 1 ev , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ pjdos ] .",
    "thus , there is a strong @xmath105 hybridization that has been heavily discussed in high t@xmath27 materials . in lanio@xmath0 ,",
    "however , ni @xmath52 states lie just below the fermi level , with o @xmath51 states located @xmath106 ev below the center of ni bands .",
    "therefore , p - d hybridization , which plays a crucial role in the electronic structure and superconductivity of cacuo@xmath0 , becomes much weaker .",
    "aside from the formal similarity to cacuo@xmath0 , the interest in lanio@xmath0 lies in the occurrence of the unusual monovalent ni ion .",
    "as we have found and in apparent agreement with experiment , this compound is a metal , and the `` charge state '' of a transition metal atom in a metal usually has much less significance than it is in an insulator",
    ". it may be because the compound is metallic that it is stable , but in this study we are not addressing energetics and stability questions .",
    "hayward @xmath37 @xmath48@xcite had already suggested that the experimental findings could arise from reduced covalency between the ni @xmath7 and o @xmath97 orbitals , and the 30% smaller value of the hopping amplitude @xmath107 indeed reflects the smaller covalency , as does the increased separation between the ni @xmath7 and o @xmath97 bands .",
    "it is something of an enigma that in cacuo@xmath0 and other cuprates , lda calculations fail to give the observed antiferromagnetic states , while in lanio@xmath0 lda predicts a weak antiferromagnetic state when there is no magnetism observed . in the cuprates",
    "the cause is known and is treated in a reasonable way by application of the lda+u method . in this",
    "nickelate , application of the lda+u method does not seem to be warranted ( although novel behavior occurs it if it used ) .",
    "rather , the prediction of weak magnetism adds this compound to the small but growing number of systems ( zrzn@xmath0,@xcite sc@xmath13in,@xcite and ni@xmath13ga,@xcite for example ) in which the tendency toward magnetism is overestimated by the local density approximation .",
    "it appears that this tendency can be corrected by accounting for magnetic fluctuations.@xcite",
    "we acknowledge useful communication with m. hayward during the course of this research , and discussions with j. kune and p. novak about the behavior of the lda+u method .",
