    "after the initial experiments with room temperature resonant detectors , the new generation of cryogenic gravitational wave ( gw ) antennas entered long term data taking operation in 1990 ( explorer  @xcite ) , in 1991 ( allegro  @xcite ) , in 1993 ( niobe  @xcite ) , in 1994 ( nautilus  @xcite ) and in 1997 ( auriga  @xcite ) .",
    "recently an analysis of the data taken in coincidence among all cryogenic resonant detectors in operation during the years 1997 and 1998 has been performed  @xcite .",
    "no coincidence excess was found above background using the event lists produced under the protocol of the international gravitational event collaboration ( igec ) , among the groups of allegro , auriga , explorer / nautilus and niobe .",
    "the coincidence search was done without any particular data selection .",
    "however one can consider the possibility to search for coincidences with events selected according to various possible criteria using all available information ( we mention criteria based on : the event energy , the event duration , the applied threshold , the shape of the events , the coincidence window , the direction of possible gw , the noise ) .    here",
    "we have used algorithms based on physical characteristics of the detectors , as the event energy ( with a new algorithm ) and the directionality . in this paper",
    "we explore their effect on the coincidence search .    for this purpose we shall use igec data obtained from 2 june 1998 when nautilus , after a stop for instrumental improvements , resumed the operation .",
    "we search for coincidences between nautilus and explorer , whose apparatuses differ only in the operating temperatures ( respectively 0.15 k and 2.6 k ) and in particular have identical readout systems .",
    "extension of the methods we develop here to other detectors in operation during the same period of time is envisaged .",
    "we are well aware that any data selection jeopardizes the possibility to express the results by means of a @xmath0 that a coincidence excess , if any , had been accidental . with this @xmath1",
    "we shall still use parameters obtained from probability estimations for comparing different situations .    0.1 in    .",
    "main characteristics of the two detectors . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ combi ]    we notice that the use of the energy selection algorithm has reduced the number of the accidental coincidences by a factor of three .",
    "no extragalactic gw signals should be detected with the present detectors .",
    "therefore we shall focus our attention on possible sources located in the galaxy .",
    "if any of these sources exist we should expect a more favorable condition of detection when the detectors are oriented with their axes perpendicular to the direction toward the galactic centre ( gc ) , since , the bar cross - section is proportional to @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the angle between the detector axis and the direction to the gc .",
    "after having applied the above energy algorithm , we search for coincidences considering only events obtained when the detectors were oriented with @xmath3 greater than various given values and , according to the previous sections , for the various data selection .    the result is given in fig.[versoteta ] and shows a larger coincidence excess when the detector axes tend to be perpendicular to the direction towards the gc .    above @xmath4",
    "the number @xmath5 of coincidences drops quickly .",
    "if not instrumental , the quick drop could be taken as due to the width of the source .",
    "the time spent by the detectors when @xmath6 is 20% of the total time of 94.5 days .",
    "we want now to verify that the evaluation of the background is properly done .",
    "we do this in the condition of the greatest coincidence excess , that is for @xmath6 .",
    "we must consider that by selecting only times when the detectors had certain orientations we have several empty time regions .",
    "this makes it possible that in doing the shifting operation for evaluating the background one uses time periods of different duration .",
    "we have determined these time periods and found that they vary by a few percent , with a maximum of -10% for a time shift of + 1000 s. in fig .",
    "[ delay ] we show , for the case @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the delay histogram with no correction and the delay histogram corrected for the different periods of time for each shift .    in this particular case",
    "the correction applies for a very small amount only for delays greater than about 700 s.",
    "in order to make a first step to a complete analysis , we have selected the igec events of explorer and nautilus using algorithms based on known physical characteristics of the detectors . in particular a new algorithm which makes",
    "use of the event energy has been devised .    with event selection based on this algorithm",
    "we find an excess of coincidences at zero time delay in the direction of the galactic centre . as well known in the scientific community , no g.w .",
    "signals are expected to be observed with the present detector sensitivity .",
    "since this result would open new possibilities , a careful bayesan approach suggests that , given the poisson probabilities of a few percent , new data with other detectors are required before we can ensure that g.w . from the gc have been indeed observed .",
    "thus , at present , we feel that the coincidence excess is not large enough to establish a claim for detection of true signals , but it is an important information to make available to the scientific community .",
    "we believe that the procedures adopted here might be useful for detecting gravitational waves with more or better data .",
