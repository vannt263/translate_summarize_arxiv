    "the observed accelerated expansion of the universe , as evidenced by a host of cosmological data such as supernovae ia ( sneia ) @xcite , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite , large scale structure ( lss ) @xcite , etc .",
    ", came as a great surprise to cosmologists .",
    "the present accelerated phase of the universe expansion reveals new physics missing from our universe s picture , and it constitutes the fundamental key to understand the fate of the universe .",
    "there are two representative approaches to explain the current acceleration of the universe .",
    "one is to introduce `` dark energy '' ( de ) @xcite in the framework of general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "the other is to consider a theory of modified gravity ( mg ) , such as @xmath0 gravity , in which the einstein - hilbert action in gr is generalized from the ricci scalar @xmath2 to an arbitrary function of the ricci scalar @xcite . here",
    ", we will focus on the later approach .    in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that a @xmath0 model with negative and positive powers of ricci curvature scalar @xmath2 can naturally combine the inflation at early times and the cosmic acceleration at late times .",
    "it is actually possible for viable @xmath0 models for late time acceleration to include inflation by adding @xmath3 term .",
    "therefore , it is natural to consider combined @xmath0 models which describe both primordial and present de using one @xmath0 function , albeit one containing two greatly different characteristic energy scales @xcite . in @xcite , it was pointed out that the @xmath0-gravity can also serve as dark matter ( dm ) . in @xcite , a set of @xmath0-gravity models corresponding to different de models were reconstructed .",
    "although a great variety of @xmath0 models have been proposed in the literature , most of them is not perfect enough .",
    "an interesting feature of the @xmath0 theories is the fact that the gravitational constant in @xmath0-gravity , varies with length scale as well as with time @xcite-@xcite .",
    "thus the evolution of the matter density perturbation , @xmath4 , in this theory is affected by the effective newton coupling constant , @xmath5 , and it is scale dependent too .",
    "therefore , the matter density perturbation is a crucial tool to distinguish mg from de model in gr , in particular the standard @xmath1cdm model .",
    "on the other hand , the connection between gravity and thermodynamics is one of surprising features of gravity which was first reinforced by jacobson @xcite , who associated the einstein field equations with the clausius relation in the context of black hole thermodynamics .",
    "this idea was also extended to the cosmological context and it was shown that the friedmann equations in the einstein gravity @xcite can be written in the form of the first law of thermodynamics ( the clausius relation ) .",
    "the equivalence between the first law of thermodynamics and the friedmann equation was also found for @xmath0-gravity @xcite . besides the first law",
    ", the generalized second law ( gsl ) of gravitational thermodynamics , which states that entropy of the fluid inside the horizon plus the geometric entropy do not decrease with time , was also investigated in @xmath0-gravity @xcite .",
    "the gsl of thermodynamics in the accelerating universe driven by de or mg has been also studied extensively in the literature @xcite-@xcite .",
    "all mentioned in above motivate us to investigate the growth of matter density perturbations in a class of metric @xmath0 models and see scale dependence of growth factor . additionally , we are interested in examining the validity of gsl in some viable @xmath0-gravity models .",
