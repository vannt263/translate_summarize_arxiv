    "there has been much recent interest in quantum mechanics of nanoscopic magnets that possess mechanical freedom .",

    "theoretical research on free magnetic particles has been scarce .",
    "the generic problem is that of a rigid quantum rotor with a spin . without a spin",
    "this problem is tractable by analytical methods only for a symmetric rotor @xcite .",
    "complications resulting from spin degrees of freedom make even symmetric cases significantly more difficult @xcite .",
    "first attempt to understand how mechanical freedom of a small magnetic particle affects tunneling of the magnetic moment was made in ref .",
    ", where it was noticed that tunneling of a macroscpin in a free particle must be entangled with mechanical rotations in order to conserve the total angular momentum ( spin + orbital ) .",
    "similar situation occurs for tunneling of a superconducting current between clockwise and counterclockwise directions in a squid @xcite .",
    "recently , it was demonstrated @xcite that the problem of a rigid rotor with a spin can be solved exactly in the laboratory frame when mechanical rotation is allowed only about a fixed axis and the spin states are reduced to spin - up and spin - down due to strong magnetic anisotropy .",
    "the latter is typical for magnetic molecules and small ferromagnetic clusters @xcite .",
    "the reduction to two spin states in a system rotating about a fixed axis also allows one to obtain simple solution of the problems of a magnetic molecule embedded in a microcantilever @xcite , magnetic molecule vibrating between conducting leads @xcite , and of a macrospin tunneling inside a torsional resonator @xcite .",
    "however , the problem for arbitrary rotations of a two - state spin system , which is relevant to free magnetic nanoparticles , remained unsolved until now .    in this paper",
    "we show that the problem of a two - state macrospin inside a symmetric rigid rotor has rigorous solution for arbitrary rotations in the coordinate frame that is rigidly coupled to the rotor .",
    "magnetic moment of the electrically neutral rotor is entirely due to spin .",
    "it depends on the relative contribution of the up and down spin states .",
    "when a nanoparticle is embedded in a solid , tunneling of the spin results in a zero ground - state magnetic moment .",
    "this situation changes for a free particle due to a complex interplay between spin and mechanical angular momentum that conserves the total angular momentum .",
    "we show that the energy of the particle exhibits first- or second - order quantum phase transitions between states with different values of the total angular momentum when the latter is treated as a continuous variable .",
    "the order of the transition depends on the shape of the particle .",
    "the ground - state magnetic moment of a free particle with a total spin @xmath0 can be anything between zero and @xmath1 , depending on the principal moments of inertia ( with @xmath2 being the bohr magneton and @xmath3 being the gyromagnetic factor associated with the spin ) .",

    "the ground state and first excited state are symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of @xmath30 , respectively @xcite , @xmath32 which satisfy @xmath33 where @xmath34 the tunnel splitting @xmath35 is generally many orders of magnitude smaller than the distance to other spin energy levels , which makes the two - state approximation very accurate at low energies .",
    "for example , @xmath36 with @xmath37 describes the biaxial anisotropy of spin-10 molecular nanomagnet fe-8 , where the tunnel splitting in the limit of large @xmath0 is given by@xcite @xmath38 the distance to the next excited spin level is @xmath39 , which is large compared to @xmath35 .",

    "is localized in the up or down state .",
    "it is clear that delocalization of the magnetic moment due to spin tunneling reduces the energy by @xmath48 . in a free particle ,",
    "however , tunneling of the spin must be accompanied by mechanical rotations in order to conserve the total angular momentum .",
    "such rotations cost energy , so it is not a priori clear whether the tunneling will survive in a free particle and what the ground state is going to be .",
    "this problem is addressed in the following section .",

    "this operator may appear unconventional due to the different sign of commutation relations for @xmath50 and @xmath23 . however , this problem can be easily fixed @xcite by the transformation @xmath51 that changes the sign of the commutation relation for @xmath23 .",
    "such a transformation does not change the results of the previous section because the crystal field hamiltonian contains only even powers of @xmath23 .",

    "in addition , operator @xmath54 is the same in the body and laboratory frames @xcite .",
    "this permits description of quantum states of the particle in terms of quantum numbers associated independently with the total angular momentum and spin .",
    "the full hamiltonian is given by the sum of the rotational energy and magnetic anisotropy energy @xmath55 expressing the mechanical angular momentum @xmath56 in terms of the total angular momentum @xmath57 and the spin @xmath58 , we get @xmath59 for a symmetric rigid rotor with @xmath13 this hamiltonian reduces to @xmath60 where @xmath61 the last term in @xmath62 is an unessential constant , @xmath63 .",
    "the second term provides renormalization of the crystal field in a freely rotating particle . for , e.g. , the biaxial spin hamiltonian given by eq .",
    "( [ cf ] ) it leads to @xmath64 this , in turn , renormalizes the tunnel splitting given by eq.([delta ] ) . for a particle that is allowed to rotate about the @xmath65-axis",
    "only ( that is , in the limit of @xmath66 ) these results coincide with the results obtained by the instanton method in ref .  , where it was shown that , in practice , the renormalization of the magnetic anisotropy and spin tunnel splitting by mechanical rotations is small .",

    "this means that the minimal energy states in the presence of spin tunneling always correspond to mechanical rotations about the magnetic anisotropy axis .",
    "this is easy to understand by noticing that the sole reason for mechanical rotation is the necessity to conserve the total angular momentum while allowing spin tunneling to lower the energy . to accomplish this",
