    "in these proceedings , advances in understanding qcd are discussed in experiments which directly complement those where measurements of the photon structure are being made . for a generalised accelerator , where the incoming particles , @xmath0 and @xmath1 resolve into partons ,",
    "the cross section at leading order , @xmath2 , can be written as , @xmath3 where @xmath4 , is the parton density function for a give momentum fraction , @xmath5 and factorisation scale , @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the @xmath8 matrix element .",
    "this entails two or three unknowns ; the perturbatively calculable matrix element and one or two structure functions . from equation  ( [ eq1 ] ) it can be seen that other experiments , such as the tevatron , can provide complementary information on @xmath7 and therefore indirectly help measurements of the photon structure function .",
    "improvements in the understanding of pqcd for jet photoproduction have led to the agreement bewteen independent calculations to within @xmath9  @xcite . considering the cross section as a function of pseudorapidity of one jet whilst restricting the other jet in the dijet system to a smaller region in pseudorapidity provides a good test of dijet production and the structure of the photon  @xcite .    in a recent paper  @xcite ,",
    "aurenche et al . have considered using the hera photoproduction data to constrain the gluon content of the photon and proton .",
    "the distribution in , the fraction of the photon s energy participating in the production of the two highest energy jets ; @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the initial photon energy , was considered in different regions of pseudorapodity of the jet . requiring two jets , @xmath12  gev and the pseudorapidity , @xmath13 , the cross section shows a small dependence on the gluon distribution in the photon .",
    "however , when the jets are constrained to be more forward in pseudorapidity , @xmath14 , a significant sensitivity is seen at low@xmath15 . a change of @xmath16 in the gluon density of the photon results in a @xmath17 change in the cross section at @xmath18 .",
    "the nlo predictions are then compared to published data from the zeus collaboration  @xcite , in which two jets , @xmath19  gev , are required to be within @xmath20 .",
    "the comparison is shown in figure  [ eta_data ] , where one jet is restricted to be in the forward region , @xmath14 ( figure  [ eta_data]a ) and the rear direction @xmath21 ( figure  [ eta_data]b ) .",
    "( 0,0)(100,100 ) ( 142,53 ) * * ( 230,56 ) * *        in figure  [ eta_data]a , increasing the gluon density in the photon by a value of @xmath22 improves the description of the data at large values of @xmath23 , increasing the cross section by @xmath24 . at negative values of @xmath23 ,",
    "the prediction remains the same and is larger than the data , however this region is subject to large hadronisation corrections .",
    "when the jet is in the rear direction as in figure  [ eta_data]b , the cross section is less sensitive to the photon structure function and more so to the proton structure function .",
    "decreasing the gluon density of the proton by @xmath22 in this region improves the description of the data .",
    "however , it should again be noted that the hadronisation corrections increase with decreasing @xmath23 .",
    "aurenche et al .",
    "conclude that the hera data indicates a roughly @xmath22 increase in the gluon content of the photon and a @xmath22 decrease in the gluon content of the proton .",
    "the errors on the measurements are , however , as large as the change in cross section of these variations .",
    "improved measurements are needed with larger statistics and are being investigated by both the h1 and zeus collaborations  @xcite .",
    "tests of qcd from other experiments , such as those at the tevatron , complement those at hera and lep , with the tevatron having the advantage of a better constrained incoming particle , the proton .",
    "roughly , where hera finishes ; @xmath25  gev and @xmath26  gev , the tevatron starts , providing overlap between the experiments at the different colliders .",
    "a selection of results of relevance to high@xmath27 measurements at hera and lep will be discussed . in particular , high@xmath27 jet production , jet substructure and prompt photon production will all be discussed later in the proceedings from at least one of the hera or lep experiments  @xcite .",
    "inclusive jet measurements at the tevatron extend to values of @xmath28  gev  @xcite , falling by @xmath29 orders of magnitude as in figure  [ incl_cdf_d0 ] .",
    "the nlo prediction describes the data from the d0 collaboration very well , with the cdf data lying above the prediction at high transverse energies , which could be a signal for new physics such as quark substructure .",
    "however , the proton structure function is less well constrained at these large scales and the question of whether the data can be accomodated in a change of the proton pdf arises .    in figure",
    "[ incl_3pdfs ] , the data is compared to the same calculation with three different proton structure functions .",
    "the mrst pdf gives a generally poor description of both the cdf and d0 measurements at low and high transverse energies .",
    "the cteq4 m proton pdf gives a good description of the d0 data but inadequately describes the cdf data at high transverse energies .",
    "the cteq4hj pdf includes the cdf data from run ia in its fit , so would be expected to describe the run  ib data shown better than the other structure functions .",
    "this modified pdf describes well the d0 and the newer cdf data .",
    "the comparison of data and theory clearly displays how understanding the parton density functions is essential in interpreting measurements in terms of new physics .",
    "data to be and already analysed at hera will allow the proton pdf to be further constrained at higher scales and hence more accurate predictions for the tevatron measurements in run ii .",
    "the tevatron also produced data at centre - of - mass energies , @xmath30  gev , lower than the nominal @xmath31  gev .",
    "comparing the cross sections at the two different energies provides a test of qcd whilst reducing systematic uncertainties on the measurement and the sensitivity to the choice of proton pdf .",
    "figure  [ s_ratio]a shows the ratio of the inclusive jet cross sections as a funtion of @xmath32 for both cdf and d0 data compared to nlo predictions .",
    "the reduction in the uncertainty in the choice of proton pdf can be seen in the difference of the prediction given by the three lines . at moderate and large @xmath33",
    ", the data agree well between the two collaborations , however at low @xmath33 , the data sets diverge . at these lower values of @xmath33 ,",
    "the data suffer from possible problems of understanding the soft underlying event , which , both experiments correct for . the data also lie consistently below the prediction at the scale , @xmath34 , chosen .",
    "reasons for the discrepancy are unclear , with possible interpretations being the use of different renormalistion scales or @xmath35 effects , although neither of these are attractive explanations .",
    "consideration of the invariant mass of the dijet system , like the inclusive jet cross section , provides both a test of qcd and the opportunity to search for new physics .",
    "figure  [ s_ratio]b shows the comparison of both experiments , cdf and d0 , with an nlo prediction , where the two measurements are defined with jets in different angular regions .",
    "the measured data agree very well between experiments and with the theory .",
    "there is a tendency for the data to deviate from the prediction at high masses , but the systematic errors are too large to make any firm conclusions .",
    "jet substructure has been studied at the tevatron by considering both the jet shape and subjet multiplicity . rerunning the @xmath35 algorithm on those particles assigned to jets and stopping the clustering",
    "when all values of @xmath36 satisfy @xmath37 gives numbers of subjets as a function of @xmath38 .",
    "figure  [ subjets ] show two different measurements of subjets using the @xmath35 algorithm  @xcite , where figure  [ subjets]a shows a comparison of the number of subjets in data and different mc s and figure  [ subjets]b shows how the subjet multiplicity can be used to differentiate between quark and gluon jets .",
    "the jets measured in figure  [ subjets]a are above 250 gev , which means that the scale being studied at the lowest @xmath38 is about 1 gev .",
    "when one considers this range in scale , the description of the data by herwig is extremely good .",
    "figure  [ subjets]b demonstrates a method for separating quark and gluon jets based on a statistical subtraction for events at @xmath30  gev and @xmath31  gev . as expected , gluon jets show more activity than quark jets .",
    "a method for distinguishing quark and gluon jets has also been developed by the zeus collaboration  @xcite .",
    "extensive measurements have been made and much theoretical work performed on prompt photon production at the tevatron and fixed target experiments .",
    "standard nlo perturbative calculations are unable to adequately describe the data at the tevatron as shown in figure  [ cdf_owens]a . here",
    ", it can be seen that the data rise dramatically at low@xmath39 , the shape of which can not be reproduced with a simple variation of the scale .",
    "the data can be described , however , by including an `` intrinsic @xmath35 '' for the partons in the proton .",
    "figure  [ cdf_owens]b shows the calculation rising at low@xmath39 when a value of @xmath40  gev is used  @xcite .",
    "the use of intrinsic @xmath35 is somewhat unsatisfactory , differing between data sets and centre - of - mass energies .",
    "prompt photon production has been extensively measured in fixed target experiments which have been compared with nlo predictions  @xcite .",
    "the nlo calculation from aurenche et al  @xcite is able to describe all the fixed target data above a cut - off , @xmath41  gev except that from e706 .",
    "the ratio of data to theory is shown in figure  [ fixed_target]a , where the e706 data is shown to dramatically rise at low @xmath42 .",
    "calculations resumming large logarithms in @xmath33  @xcite are also unable to describe the e706 data as shown in figure  [ fixed_target]b , although one would expect the resummation to improve the high@xmath39 and not low@xmath39 region .",
    "figure  [ fixed_target]b also demonstrates how the resummation reduces the scale uncertainty in the calculation .",
    "calculations in which @xmath43 , the nett transverse momentum of the final state @xmath44 pair , is resummed  @xcite improve the description of the e706 data at low @xmath45 , although the nlo prediction is still too low .",
    "hera data can provide useful informationon on intrinsic @xmath35 , by filling the energy `` gap '' between the fixed target and tevatron experiments  @xcite .",
    "the last few years have seen large advances in producing higher order calculations for the production of two or three jets  @xcite . calculations of nlo 3@xmath46jet hadroproduction are becoming available and nnlo 2@xmath46jet hadroproduction will be produced sometime in the future .",
    "the needs for a 3@xmath46jet nlo calculation are many  @xcite .",
    "measuring the 3@xmath46jet to 2@xmath46jet production ratio and hence @xmath47 will be possible with a 3@xmath46jet nlo calculation .",
    "as well as testing qcd , the calculation will provide a better understanding of backgrounds to new physics processes .",
    "it is also an important step towards calculating nnlo 2@xmath46jet production .",
    "figure  [ 3-jet ] shows the predicted cross section for the highest - transverse - energy jet in 3@xmath46jet hadroproduction for both lo and nlo and their respective estimtaions of the scale uncertainty .",
    "the central nlo and lo predictions are of similar value , however , nlo shows a large reduction in the scale uncertainty over lo .",
    "progress on calculations of nnlo 2@xmath46jet hadroproduction has been good over the last two years and the interested reader is referred to recent talks on the subject  @xcite . a nnlo calculation for the production of two jets",
    "is anticipated in a few years where a reliable estimate of the error on the cross section will be acheived .",
    "from the results presented , it can be seen that the theory of pqcd broadly describes the theory of the strong interaction .",
    "however , more detail both experimentally and theoretically is required to test qcd to great precision .",
    "this can also be acheived by considering the information from all experiments and what their results mean for each other .",
