    "a formation and evolution of stars and binary systems are very slow processes ( typical timescales of @xmath2 yr ) and can not be directly traced .",
    "the only way to understand them is to study populations of sources .",
    "properties of an ensemble of sources at different stages of their evolution do have characteristics which can be measured and compared with predictions of different models .",
    "x - ray sources in our galaxy were discovered quite long ago @xcite and studied intensively in different ways during @xmath3 years .",
    "advances in a sensitivity and angular resolution of current x - ray telescopes allow now to detect and count such objects in a variety of outer galaxies ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in spite of this observational progress",
    "the properties of populations of different types of x - ray sources are not fully understood yet .",
    "the main reason for this is a scarce information about physical properties of large samples of hmxbs .",
    "objects in outer galaxies can be counted and their x - ray appearances measured , but physical properties of detected sources ( first of all , types and ages of their stellar components , orbital periods , etc . ) , which can help to understand their formation and evolution , rarely can be obtained ( typically from optical or infrared instruments ) due to their extreme faintness .    on the other hand  physical properties of stellar binaries in our galaxy can often be well measured , but the uniform highly sensitive surveys of such objects were absent until recently . a strong absorption of soft x - rays ( @xmath4 kev ) in the interstellar medium or near binaries themselves have not allowed to obtain an unbiased sample of sources in the galactic plane from the rosat all sky survey @xcite .",
    "surveys , performed with the asca @xcite and xmm - newton @xcite observatories , are somewhat free from these limitations , but both observatories covered only small areas of the galactic plane .",
    "x - ray instruments , which operate in the harder x - ray energy range , where the interstellar photo - absorption does not play an important role , and can cover the whole galaxy , have typically a poor angular resolution and thus are affected by a source confusion in the galactic plane ( e.g. , uhuru , @xcite ; rxte , @xcite ) .",
    "samples of sources , collected over all history of x - ray astronomy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can not to be taken as a representative for statistical and physical studies of populations due to their non - uniformity respect to the flux , detection criteria , etc .",
    "a systematic survey of the galaxy in 2003 - 2011 with the integral observatory @xcite in the hard x - ray energy range ( @xmath5 kev ) with the moderate angular resolution ( @xmath6 ) allowed us for the first time to overcome all these difficulties and to perform virtually unbiased search for x - ray binaries in the milky way with an unprecedented sensitivity @xcite .",
    "previous observations of galactic sources with the integral observatory have proved to be fruitful in a variety of fields : for explanation of the origin of the galactic ridge x - ray emission in hard x - rays @xcite ; for systematic discoveries of strongly photoabsorbed high mass x - ray binaries and study of their distribution in the galaxy ; for confirmation of the presence of the break in the luminosity function of low mass x - ray binaries @xcite , which is likely related with changes of the evolutionary type of stellar companions in these systems @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present the most sensitive unbiased flux - limited sample of non - transient high mass x - ray binaries in our galaxy .",
    "our main goal is to establish and understand general properties of this population .",
    "this knowledge is a very important for different reasons : for understanding of properties of compact objects , their formation and evolution ; for explanation of the observed behaviour of different types of hmxbs ( in particular , supergiant fast x - ray transients ) ; for interpretation of observations of variety of galaxies , which are now became possible with new generation of x - ray telescopes ( in particular , to calculate a contribution of hmxbs to observed luminosities ) , etc .",
    "in our study we use results from the integral galactic plane survey , presented in @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of this survey is typically @xmath7  in the 17 - 60 kev energy band , which ensures the detection of sources with luminosities @xmath8  within a half of the galaxy ( @xmath9 kpc from the sun ) and @xmath10  over the whole galaxy ( @xmath11 kpc from the sun ) .",
    "one of advantages of the integral galactic plane survey is the multiple coverage of virtually all galactic sources . during the period of operation",
    "all parts of the galaxy were observed tens of times , that allow us to quantify a long term behaviour of a majority of sources .",
    "this is important because the goal of our work is to understand properties of the population of high mass x - ray binaries , which are typically registered ( or can be registered ) in existing and future surveys both our galaxy and distant galaxies .",
    "_ therefore in our work we concentrate only on persistent sources_. transiently appearing hmxbs typically have small duty cycles and thus they should be a minority among the population of hmxbs detected in snapshot observations of galaxies .",

    "coordinates and fluxes of 26 non - identified persistent sources are shown by circles .",
    "uncertainties correspond to @xmath12 .",
    "dashed line denotes the survey flux limit ( see text for details ) . ]    as a first step , among sources detected on the average map of the galactic plane we exclude all sources which are known to be not high mass x - ray binaries .",
    "the remaining objects are either hmxbs or unidentified sources . in total , 75 hmxbs with a confirmed nature and 33 sources of an unknown origin ( including hmxb candidates ) at latitudes @xmath13 were detected during the integral galactic plane survey @xcite .",
    "then we exclude transient sources from our sample .",
    "there is no firmly established concept of a transiency , therefore this is a non - trivial task . to illustrate it ,",
    "some examples of a different long term behaviour of sources are shown in fig.[distr ] , where one can see light curves ( upper panels ) and distributions of fluxes ( bottom panel ) of three sources , representing three big families of high mass x - ray binaries : ( quasi-)persistent sources , be - transients and supergiant fast x - ray transients ( sfxts ) .",
    "we quantify the  persistency  of a source via a ratio of two flux values : the median flux value @xmath14 and the mean flux value @xmath15 . for our main source sample",
    "we accept only sources which have the ratio @xmath16 .",
    "this resulted in 54 confirmed hmxbs and 26 unidentified sources .",
    "it is necessary to note , that several sfxts or candidates , which are named  trantients  , still passed the selection criteria .",
    "it can be connected with a high duty cycle for some sources ( like igrj16479 - 4514 ) or due to a luminosity dynamic range not particularly high for some sources in the integral energy band ( this could be the case of the so called intermediate sfxts igrj17354 - 3255 , igrj16418 - 4532 , axj1845.0 - 0433 ) .    in order to further increase the identification completeness of our sample we raise the flux limit of the survey , as virtually all non - identified sources are faint .",
    "the sensitivity of the survey is shown as a function of the galactic longitude in fig.[sensflux ] .",
    "it was calculated as the average value of the integral / ibis / isgri sensitivity over galactic latitudes @xmath17 for each longitude direction .",
    "circles denote fluxes of non - identified sources with their uncertainties .",
    "two important facts are clearly seen from this figure : 1 ) the survey sensitivity is not uniform over the galaxy and is much better in its inner part ( directions with @xmath18 ) ; 2 ) all non - identified sources are faint .",
    "thus , if we increase the survey flux limit up to @xmath19 mcrab ( @xmath7  in the @xmath20 kev energy band ) over the galactic longitude range @xmath21 and @xmath22 mcrab in the remaining part of the galaxy there will be no non - identified sources in our sample . at the same time",
    ", the list of known hmxbs will shorten to 48 sources .",

    "the last ones were extracted from corresponding light curves of sources binned into @xmath83 ksec bins . it should be noted here that the true peak luminosities might be higher in some cases if smaller time bins would be used .",
    "it is clear that the median luminosities of genuine sfxts lie in the forbidden area , i.e. below the line of the minimal x - ray luminosity , allowed for the wind - fed ns in the binary system with the young star having the smallest mass loss rate in the wind ( see section 4.2 ) . _",
    "it explicitly means that most of the time the accretion in sfxts is inhibited by some mechanism .",
    "_ the only one source , which median value lies in the allowed area ",
    "igrj16465 - 4507  sometimes classified as an `` intermediate '' sfxt , and its flux variability is largely related with the orbital modulation of the accretion flow @xcite .",
    "somewhat a similar situation is emerging for igrj16418 - 4532 , which is firmly established sfxt , but located near the border between allowed and forbidden areas .",
    "it happen only because we were limiting ourself with data of integral / ibis , which are significantly worse that those of focusing x - ray telescopes .",
    "if we instead use the results of @xcite , obtained with the xrt / swift telescope , the median luminosity of the source in the quiescent state will be @xmath84 , that is @xmath85 times lower than it was measured by integral . in this case the source position in the quiescence state will be deeply in the forbidden area ( dashed line and circle in fig.[porb_lx_sfxt ] ) . finally , concerning igrj16418 - 4532 , it is necessary to note a possible high uncertainties for its distance .",
    "the clumpy wind model can produce flares , but it can not explain why the median x - ray luminosity of the sfxt binary is much lower than that of the similar binary with the similar orbital period , but not classified as the sfxt .    in order to see directly the outlined dichotomy we can compare sources igrj17544 - 2619 and igrj18027 - 2016 .",
    "optical stars in both binaries have similar spectral types ",
    "o9ib for the former and obsg for the latter , both have the similar orbital periods ( around 5 days ) and thus the similar separation between components in the system .",
    "but the first one is a fast transient ( sfxt ) and the latter one is a normal accreting pulsar .",
    "this example clearly shows that there are some additional parameters in the binary system ( e.g. , magnetic field and spin period of the neutron star ) , which determines its global behavior .",
    "the position of the sfxts binary along the y - axis in fig.[porb_lx_sfxt ] should depend on the duty cycle of its activity .",
    "it is natural to propose that the duty cycle should be higher and the ratio of the peak fluxes to the median ones should be smaller if the source is closer to the allowed region . such a source will `` degenerate '' into the normal persistent supergiant hmxb if its position will be within the allowed region .",
    "note , that systematic studies of known sfxts do show such a trend for all sources except for igrj16479 - 4514 @xcite .",
    "it is possible that such a deviation in the overall trend is related with the fact that in this binary the optical star is close to filling its roche lobe and our toy model of the wind accretion is not applicable to it .",
    "a general understanding of the luminosity function of hmxbs and their galaxy - wide distribution provides us a possibility to make predictions of a number of persistent sources at fainter fluxes .    using the real sensitivity of the integral galactic plane survey instead of our adopted value 0.7 mcrab ( see fig.[sensflux ] ) we can predict that in total we should detect up to @xmath86 persistent hmxbs ( here we have taken into account that surface densities , calculated in section 3.2 , do not include 5 hmxbs with unknown distances and thus the true surface densities of hmxbs might be @xmath8714% higher than it is presented in table 2 ) .",
    "forty two of them were already observed with the adopted flux limit 0.7 mcrab . below this limit",
    "there should be only @xmath8712 persistent hmxbs among all unidentified integral sources .",
    "six of them were already detected in the survey ( see table [ tab : srclist ] ) .",
    "judging from estimates of surface densities of different types of sources on the sky we can anticipate that the majority of the remaining galactic sources will be cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) .    ) and scutum regions ( @xmath88 ) in the galactic plane ( gray areas ) .",
    "lines show predictions of numbers of different types of sources in these areas : agns ( dashed line ) , cvs ( dotted line ) and hmxbs ( solid lines ) .",
    "predictions of a number of hmxbs at faint fluxes were done using two types of their lf with different slopes @xmath89 at luminosities below @xmath90  ( at higher luminosities the lf was taken as measured , see table 2 ) : 1 ) an upper solid curve ",
    "the slope is fixed at the value @xmath91 , as measured at @xmath90 @xmath92 2 ) a lower solid curve  the slope of the lf is fixed at the value @xmath93 , as predicted from our toy model ( see fig.[lf_sim ] ) . ]",
    "this conclusion follows from fig.[lognlogs_predict ] , where the expected number of hmxbs in flux limited surveys of the galacti plane is shown in line with ones for active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and cvs .",
    "a number - flux function of agns was taken from @xcite , a number - flux function of cataclysmic variables was calculated using the parametrization from @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the number of cvs and agns begin to dominate over hmxbs at fluxes below @xmath94 , which will be achieved with the new generation of hard x - ray telescopes like nustar @xcite and astro - h @xcite .",
    "small fields of view of these instruments will limit the detection rate of hmxbs . in order to increase",
    "the number of known persistent hmxbs in the galaxy ( mainly due to low luminosity sources ) one need to use large survey missions like spectrum - rg @xcite .",
    "we have constructed for the first time a well defined sample of non - transient high mass x - ray binaries in our galaxy using the flux limited 9-years long survey of the integral observatory .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows :    * the majority of persistent hmxbs accrete matter from the stellar wind of their supergiant / giant companions ; * the luminosity function of wind - fed persistent hmxbs with accreting neutron stars can be described by a broken power law with the break around @xmath0 ; at high luminosities the power law slope of the differential luminosity function is @xmath95 , at low luminosities @xmath96 ; * using this luminosity function we have showed that the predicted number of hmxbs will be significantly lower than number of cvs and agns in future surveys with the better sensitivity ( nustar , astro - h ) ; * the spatial density distribution of wind - fed ns - hmxbs over the galaxy have been measured .",
    "we have divided the galaxy into several annuli and showed that the hmxbs surface density has a maximum on galactocentric distances 2 - 8 kpc .",
    "such a distribution correlates well with the distribution of the surface density of the star formation rate in the galaxy .",
    "* we have constructed a simple toy model of the wind - fed ns - hmxbs population and showed that it can adequately describe properties of the observed population .",
    "the model clearly shows that wind - fed hmxbs should disappear at luminosities higher than @xmath97  and their lf should flatten at @xmath98 .",
    "the overall shape of the luminosity function of the simulated population agrees with the measured one ; * we argued that for wind - fed ns - hmxbs there is an `` allowed '' region on the @xmath99 diagram due to general properties of the wind accretion .",
    "we demonstrated that all persistent wind - fed hmxb lies in this allowed area .",
    "* all supergiant fast x - ray transients ( sfxts ) in their quiescent state lie in the  forbidden  area of the @xmath99 diagram and only during flares they ",
    "jump  into the  allowed  region .",
    "this strongly supports the idea that their transient behavior is caused by some kind of ( possible magnetic ) inhibition of the accretion onto the neutron star .",

    "<S> we show that the spatial density distribution of hmxbs correlates well with the star formation rate distribution in the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the vertical distribution of hmxbs has a scale - height @xmath1 pc , that is somewhat larger than the distribution of young stars in the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a simple toy model , which adequately describes general properties of hmxbs in which neutron stars accrete a matter from the wind of the its companion ( wind - fed ns - hmxbs population ) . </S>",
    "<S> using the elaborated model we argue that a flaring activity of so - called supergiant fast x - ray transients , the recently recognized sub - sample of hmxbs , is likely related with the magnetic arrest of their accretion .    </S>",
