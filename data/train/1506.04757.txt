    "we are interested here in uncovering relationships between the appearances of pairs of objects , and particularly in modeling the human notion of which objects complement each other and which might be seen as acceptable alternatives .",
    "we thus seek to model what is a fundamentally human notion of the visual relationship between a pair of objects , rather than merely modeling the visual similarity between them .",
    "there has been some interest of late in modeling the visual style of places @xcite , and objects @xcite .",
    "we , in contrast , are not seeking to model the individual appearances of objects , but rather how the appearance of one object might influence the desirable visual attributes of another .",
    "there are a range of situations in which the appearance of an object might have an impact on the desired appearance of another .",
    "questions such as ` which frame goes with this picture ' , ` where is the lid to this ' , and ` which shirt matches these shoes ' ( see figure  [ fig : brownloaferquery ] ) inherently involve a calculation of more than just visual similarity , but rather a model of the higher - level relationships between objects .",
    "the primary commercial application for such technology is in recommending items to a user based on other items they have already showed interest in .",
    "such systems are of considerable economic value , and are typically built by analysing meta - data , reviews , and previous purchasing patterns . by introducing into these systems the ability to examine the appearance of the objects in question we aim to overcome some of their limitations , including the ` cold start ' problem @xcite .",
    "the problem we pose inherently requires modeling human visual preferences . in most cases",
    "there is no intrinsic connection between a pair of objects , only a human notion that they are more suited to each other than are other potential partners .",
    "the most common approach to modeling such human notions exploits a set of hand - labeled images created for the task .",
    "the labeling effort required means that most such datasets are typically relatively small , although there are a few notable exceptions .",
    "a small dataset means that complex procedures are required to extract as much information as possible without over - fitting ( see @xcite for example ) .",
    "it also means that the results are unlikely to be transferable to related problems .",
    "creating a labeled dataset is particularly onerous when modeling pairwise distances because the number of annotations required scales with the square of the number of elements .",
    "we propose here instead that one might operate over a much larger dataset , even if it is only tangentially related to the ultimate goal .",
    "thus , rather than devising a process ( or budget ) for manually annotating images , we instead seek a freely available source of a large amount of data which may be more loosely related to the information we seek .",
    "large - scale databases have been collected from the web ( without other annotation ) previously @xcite .",
    "what distinguishes the approach we propose here , however , is the fact that it succeeds despite the indirectness of the connection between the dataset and the quantity we hope to model .      we have developed a dataset suitable for the purposes described above based on the amazonweb store .",
    "the dataset contains over @xmath0 million relationships between a pool of almost 6  million objects .",
    "these relationships are a result of visiting amazonand recording the product recommendations that it provides given our ( apparent ) interest in the subject of a particular web page .",
    "the statistics of the dataset are shown in table [ tab : stats ] .",
    "an image and a category label are available for each object , as is the set of users who reviewed it .",
    "we have made this dataset available for academic use , along with all code used in this paper to ensure that our results are reproducible and extensible .",
    "we label this the _ styles and substitutes _ dataset .",
    "the recorded relationships describe two specific notions of ` compatibility ' that are of interest , namely those of _ substitute _ and _ complement _ goods .",
    "substitute goods are those that can be interchanged ( such as one pair of pants for another ) , while complements are those that might be purchased together ( such as a pair of pants and a matching shirt ) @xcite .",
    "specifically , there are 4 categories of relationship represented in the dataset : 1 ) ` users who viewed x also viewed y ' ( 65 m edges ) ; 2 ) ` users who viewed x eventually bought y ' ( 7.3 m edges ) ; 3 ) ` users who bought x also bought y ' ( 104 m edges ) ; and 4 ) ` users bought x and y simultaneously ' ( 3.4 m edges ) .",
    "critically , categories 1 and 2 indicate ( up to some noise ) that two products may be substitutable , while 3 and 4 indicate that two products may be complementary . according to amazon s own tech report @xcite the above relationships are collected simply by ranking products according to the cosine similarity of the sets of users who purchased / viewed them .",
    "note that the dataset does not document users preferences for pairs of images , but rather amazon s estimate of the set of relationships between pairs objects .",
    "the human notion of the visual compatibility of these images is only one factor amongst many which give rise to these estimated relationships , and it is not a factor used by amazonin creating them . we thus do not wish to summarize the amazondata , but rather to use what it tells us about the images of related products to develop a sense of which objects a human might feel are visually compatible .",
    "this is significant because many of the relationships between objects present in the data are not based on their appearance . people co - purchase hammers and nails due to their functions , for example , not their appearances .",
    "our hope is that the non - visual decision factors will appear as uniformly distributed noise to a method which considers only appearance , and that the visual decision factors might reinforce each other to overcome the effect of this noise .    [",
    "cols=\"<,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     ]        ]    for each category , we consider the subset of relationships from @xmath1 that connect products within that category . after generating random samples of non - relationships , we separate @xmath1 and @xmath2 into training , validation , and test sets ( 80/10/10% , up to a maximum of two million training relationships ) . although we do not fit hyperparameters ( and",
    "therefore do not make use of the validation set ) , we maintain this split in case it proves useful to those wishing to benchmark their algorithms on this data . while we did experiment with simple @xmath3 regularizers , we found ourselves blessed with a sufficient overabundance of data that overfitting never presented an issue ( i.e. , the validation error was rarely significantly higher than the training error ) .    to be completely clear , our protocol consists of the following :    1 .   each category and graph type forms a single experiment ( e.g.  predict ` bought together ' relationships for women s clothing ) .",
    "2 .   our goal is to distinguish relationships from non - relationships ( i.e. , link prediction ) .",
    "relationships are identified when our predictor ( eq .  [ eq : prob ] ) outputs @xmath4 .",
    "we consider _ all _ positive relationships and a random sample of non - relationships ( i.e. , ` distractors ' ) of equal size .",
    "thus the performance of a random classifier is 50% for all experiments .",
    "all results are reported on the test set .",
    "results on a selection of top - level categories are shown in table [ tab : toplevel ] , with further results for clothing data shown in table [ tab : clothing ] .",
    "recall when interpreting these results that the learned model has reference to the object images only .",
    "it is thus estimating the existence of a specified form of relationship purely on the basis of appearance .    in every case",
    "the proposed method outperforms both the category - based method and weighted nearest neighbor , and the increase from @xmath5 to @xmath6 uniformly improves performance .",
    "interestingly , the performance on compliments vs.  substitutes is approximately the same .",
    "the extent to which the @xmath6 results improve upon the wnn results may be seen as an indication of the degree to which visual similarity between images fails to capture a more complex human visual notion of which objects might be seen as being substitutes or compliments for each other .",
    "this distinction is smallest for ` books ' and greatest for ` clothing shoes and jewelery ' as might be expected .",
    "we have no ground truth relating the true human visual preference for pairs of objects , of course , and thus evaluate above against our dataset .",
    "this has the disadvantage that the dataset contains all of the amazon recommendations , rather than just those based on decisions made by humans on the basis of object appearance .",
    "this means that in addition to documenting the performance of the proposed method , the results may also be taken to indicate the extent to which visual factors impact upon the decisions of amazon customers .",
    "the comparison across categories is particularly interesting .",
    "it is to be expected that appearance would be a significant factor in clothing decisions , but it was not expected that they would be a factor in the purchase of books .",
    "one possible interpretation of this effect might be that customers have preferences for particular genres of books and that individual genres have characteristic styles of covers .",
    "finally we evaluate the ability of our model to personalize co - purchasing recommendations to individual users , that is we examine the effect of the user personalization term in ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : personal1 ] and [ eq : personal2 ] ) .",
    "here we do not use the graphs from tables [ tab : toplevel ] and [ tab : clothing ] , since those are ` population level ' graphs which are not annotated in terms of the individual users who co - purchased and co - browsed each pair of products .",
    "instead for this task we build a dataset of co - purchases from products that users have _ reviewed_. that is , we build a dataset of tuples of the form @xmath7 for pairs of products @xmath8 and",
    "@xmath9 that were purchased by user @xmath10 .",
    "we train on users with at least 20 purchases , and randomly sample 50 co - purchases and 50 non - co - purchases from each user in order to build a balanced dataset .",
    "results are shown in table [ tab : personal ] ; here we see that the addition of a user personalization term yields a small but significant improvement when predicting co - purchases ( similar results on other categories withheld for brevity ) .    ]",
    "recall that each image is projected into ` style - space ' by the transformation @xmath11 , and note that the fact that it is based on pairwise distances alone means that the embedding is invariant under isomorphism .",
    "that is , applying rotations , translations , or reflections to @xmath12 and @xmath13 will preserve their distance in ( eq .  [ eq : styledist ] ) . in light of these factors",
    "we perform k - means clustering on the @xmath14 dimensional embedded coordinates of the data in order to visualize the effect of the embedding .",
    "figure [ fig : pca ] shows images whose projections are close to the centers of a set of selected representative clusters for men s and women s clothing ( using a model trained on the ` also viewed ' graph with @xmath6 ) .",
    "naturally items cluster around colors and shapes ( e.g. shoes , t - shirts , tank tops , watches , jewelery ) , but more subtle characterizations exist as well .",
    "for instance , leather boots are separated from ugg ( that is sheep skin ) boots , despite the fact that the visual differences are subtle .",
    "this is presumably because these items are preferred by different sets of amazon users",
    ". watches cluster into different color profiles , face shapes , and digital versus analogue .",
    "other clusters cross multiple categories , for instance we find clusters of highly - colorful items , items containing love hearts , and items containing animals .",
    "figure  [ fig : whiteshoe ] shows a set of images which project to locations that span a cluster .    although performance is admittedly not outstanding for a category such as books , it is somewhat surprising that an accuracy of even 70% can be achieved when predicting book co - purchases .",
    "figure [ fig : pca_books ] visualizes a few examples of style - space clusters derived from books data . here",
    "it seems that there is at least some meaningful information in the cover of a book to predict which products might be purchased together ",
    "children s books , self - help books , romance novels , and comics ( for example ) all seem to have characteristic visual features which are identified by our model .    in figure",
    "[ fig : nav ] we show how our model can be used to navigate between related items  here we randomly select two items that are unlikely to be co - browsed , and find a low cost path between them as measured by our learned distance measure .",
    "subjectively , the model identifies visually smooth transitions between the source and the target items .",
    "figure  [ fig : stylegraph ] provides a visualization of the embedding of boys clothing achieved by setting @xmath15 ( on co - browsing data ) .",
    "sporting shoes drift smoothly toward slippers and sandals , and underwear drifts gradually toward shirts and coats .    ]",
    "we here demonstrate that the proposed model can be used to generate recommendations that might be useful to a user of a web store . given a query item ( e.g.  a product a user is currently browsing , or has just purchased ) , our goal is to recommend a selection of other items that might complement it .",
    "for example , if a user is browsing pants , we might want to recommend a shirt , shoes , or accessories that belong to the same style .    here",
    ", amazon s rich and detailed category hierarchy can help us . for categories such as",
    "women s or men s clothing , we might define an ` outfit ' as a combination of pants , a top , shoes , and an accessory ( we do this for the sake of demonstration , though far more complex combinations are possible  our category tree for clothing alone has hundreds of nodes ) .",
    "then , given a query item our goal is simply to select items from each of these categories that are most likely to be connected based on their visual style .    specifically , given a query item @xmath16 , for each category @xmath17 ( represented as a set of item indices ) ,",
    "we generate recommendations according to @xmath18 i.e. , the minimum distance according to our measure ( eq .  [ eq : u ] ) amongst objects belonging to the desired category . examples of such recommendations are shown in figures  [ fig : brownloaferquery ] and  [ fig : outfits ] , with randomly chosen queries from women s and men s clothing . generally speaking",
    "the model produces apparently reasonable recommendations , with clothes in each category usually being of a consistent style .",
    "an alternate application of the model is to make assessments about outfits ( or otherwise combinations of items ) that we observe ` in the wild ' .",
    "that is , to the extent that the tastes and preferences of amazoncustomers reflect the zeitgeist of society at large , this can be seen as a measurement of whether a candidate outfit is well coordinated visually .    to assess this possibility ,",
    "we have built two small datasets of real outfits , one consisting of twenty - five outfits worn by the hosts of _ top gear _",
    "( jeremy clarkson , richard hammond , and james may ) , and another consisting of seventeen ` before ' and ` after ' pairs of outfits from participants on the television show _ what not to wear _ ( us seasons 9 and 10 ) . for each outfit , we cropped each clothing item from the image , and then used _ google _",
    "s reverse image search to identify images of similar items ( examples are shown in figure [ fig : topgear ] ) .",
    "next we rank outfits according to the average log - likelihood of their pairs of components being related using a model trained on mens / women s co - purchases ( we take the average so that there is no bias toward outfits with more or fewer components ) .",
    "all outfits have at least two items .",
    "figure [ fig : topgear ] shows the most and least coordinated outfits on _ top gear _",
    "; here we find considerable separation between the level of coordination for each presenter ; richard hammond is typically the least coordinated , james may the most , while jeremy clarkson wears a combination of highly coordinated and highly uncoordinated outfits .",
    "a slightly more quantitative evaluation comes from the television show _ what not to wear _ : here participants receive an ` outfit makeover ' , hopefully meaning that their made - over outfit is more coordinated than the original .",
    "examples of participants before and after their makeover , along with the change in log likelihood are shown in figure [ fig : wnw ] .",
    "indeed we find that made - over outfits have a higher log likelihood in 12 of the 17 cases we observed ( @xmath19 ; log - likelihoods are normalized to correct any potential bias due to the number of components in the outfit ) .",
    "this is an important result , as it provides external ( albeit small ) validation of the learned model which is independent of our dataset .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to model the human notion of what is visually related by investigation of a suitably large dataset , even where that information is somewhat tangentially contained therein .",
    "we have also demonstrated that the proposed method is capable of modeling a variety of visual relationships beyond simple visual similarity .",
    "perhaps what distinguishes our method most is thus its ability to model what makes items _ complementary_. to our knowledge this is the first attempt to model human preference for the appearance of one object given that of another in terms of more than just the visual similarity between the two .",
    "it is almost certainly the first time that it has been attempted directly and at this scale .",
    "we also proposed visual and relational recommender systems as a potential problem of interest to the information retrieval community , and provided a large dataset for their training and evaluation . in the process we managed to figure out what not to wear , how to judge a book by its cover , and to show that james may is more fashionable than richard hammond .",
