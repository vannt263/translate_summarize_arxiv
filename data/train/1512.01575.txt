    "<S> _ conclusion. _ we introduced control protocols for characterizing the high - order spectra associated with non - gaussian dephasing on a qubit probe coupled to a classical or a quantum bosonic environment . </S>",
    "<S> our approach overcomes limitations of existing protocols , allowing in particular for spectral reconstruction over an extended bandwidth , which is of independent interest for quantum sensing applications . </S>",
    "<S> our work also points to the need for a deeper understanding of high - order quantum noise spectra  beginning from more complex dephasing settings described by non - linear spin - boson models or spin baths . </S>",
    "<S> we expect implementation of our protocols to be within reach for various device technologies , in particular transmon or flux qubits @xcite , where they may help shed light onto the microscopic origin of the noise itself .    </S>",
