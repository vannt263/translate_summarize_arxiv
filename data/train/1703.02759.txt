    "transport phenomena involving solute concentration difference or gradient of a solute - solvent fluid emerge in many scientific and industrial fields , from the chemical physics of biological membranes to the development of desalination processes .",

    "@xcite there is accordingly a need for a better fundamental understanding of such transport phenomena .",
    "osmosis across a membrane is a transport phenomenon driven by a solute concentration difference .",
    "let us consider a situation where two fluid reservoirs with solute concentration difference @xmath0 are separated by a membrane . if the membrane is completely semi - permeable , _",
    "i.e. _ , only the solvent particles are allowed to pass through the membrane , an osmotic pressure builds up , and is well described by the classical vant hoff type equation : @xmath1 , with @xmath2 the boltzmann constant , @xmath3 the temperature . in contrast , if the membrane is partially semi - permeable , _",
    "i.e. _ , solute particles are not completely rejected , then also solute flux occurs across the membrane .",
    "transport through the membrane in the latter situation is described by the kedem ",
    "kachalsky equations ,  @xcite which include the reflection coefficient @xmath4 as a phenomenological correction to the vant hoff equation .",
    "relevant definitions of @xmath4 for the low concentration regime were given , _",

    "we also provide there a comprehensive theory to understand the origin of the reflection coefficient @xmath4 at a microscopic level .",
    "@xcite    diffusio - osmotic flow is a more subtle phenomenon which occurs under solute gradients _ in the presence of a fluid - solid interface_. in a bulk fluid , a concentration gradient of a solute will lead to a diffusive flux of both components , but there is no total fluid flow because the forces acting on the solvent and solute particles are balanced .",
    "however , in the presence of an interface , the solute concentration in a thin layer near the surface differs from that in the bulk , because of either an adsorption or a repulsion of solute particles .",
    "consequently the force balance is broken in this thin layer and the driving force results in the fluid diffusio - osmotic flow .",
    "such interfacially driven flow is especially relevant to small - scale systems , typically in microfluidic devices with narrow channels and through nanoporous membranes , because of the large surface - to - volume ratio .",
    "@xcite anderson and co - workers provided a theoretical framework of the diffusio - osmotic flow for the case of low concentration of solute ,  @xcite and in the accompanying paper we extended the theory to the high - concentration regime of the solute .",
    "@xcite    in the present paper , we numerically study the microscopic aspects of these two problems , _",
    "i.e. _ , the osmosis and the diffusio - osmotic flow , using molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations .",
    "our first goal here is to validate the theoretical predictions developed in the accompanying paper , by means of direct measurements of the osmotic pressure and the diffusio - osmotic flow at a microscopic scale .",
    "however , in order to achieve this objective , one encounters a methodological difficulty in simulating the diffusio - osmotic flow directly ; there is no existing method to implement directly a chemical potential gradient compatible with periodic boundary conditions . in this study , we accordingly introduce a novel non - equilibrium md ( nemd ) technique , which circumvents this difficulty and allows to impose a proper external forcing representing a gradient in the chemical potential of the solute .",
    "we find an excellent agreement between our method and the results of a green  kubo approach based on linear - response theory , and furthermore validate onsager s reciprocal relation .",
    "the nemd method is then used to validate the theory , and applied to a more realistic system of a water - ethanol mixture in contact with a silica or a graphene surface .    in sec .",

    "then a brief summary given in sec .",
    "[ sec_summary ] concludes the paper .",
    "in this section , we first consider the osmotic pressure across a model membrane , which allows to gain much insight into the osmotic transport , and we introduce a versatile method to measure the osmotic pressure .      for the transport of a solute - solvent fluid across a filtration membrane with pressure and concentration differences between the two sides , the kedem  kachalsky model is widely used to describe the volume flux ( per unit area ) of the solution @xmath5 and the particle flux of the solute @xmath6 : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the permeability coefficient , @xmath0 is the concentration of the solute , @xmath9 is the solute permeability with @xmath10 its diffusion coefficient and @xmath11 the thickness of the membrane , @xmath12 is the factor for the effective mobility value in the membrane , and @xmath4 is the reflection coefficient that is a measure of the semi - permeability of the membrane .",
    "@xcite the non - dimensional coefficients @xmath12 and @xmath4 are expected to be related by a linear relationship ,  @xcite as @xmath13 .    most of the approaches so far treat the reflection coefficient as a phenomenological parameter , and discussion on a direct connection with parameters characterizing the membrane is rare . following our theoretical discussion in the companion paper ,",
    "we consider here a model membrane , taking the form of an energy barrier felt by the solute particles .",
    "@xcite this simplified situation allows to obtain an expression for the reflection coefficient which takes the form : @xmath14 }   \\over \\int_{-l/2}^{l/2 } { dx^\\prime \\over \\lambda[c(x^\\prime)]}{c_0\\over c(x^\\prime ) } } ,   \\label{eq : reflect-1}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the mobility of the solute particles , and @xmath16 is the average solute concentration far from the membranes ; @xmath17 is the stationary concentration distribution , see ref .  .",

    "two reservoirs are separated by a membrane as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : osm_geom](a ) ; the membrane is not visible in the figure .",
    "the left reservoir contains a pure liquid solvent , while the right reservoir is filled with a liquid solution containing solute particles .",
    "the membrane is modeled by an energy barrier @xmath19 , which acts only on the solute particles , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : osm_geom](b ) .",
    "the ends of the reservoirs are closed by rigid walls consisting of an fcc lattice made of the same particles as the solvent .",
    "the left wall serves as a piston , maintaining the normal pressure in the left reservoir at @xmath21 . on the other hand ,",

    "we observe indeed that the osmotic pressure drops , coherently with @xmath55 .",
    "in this situation , the pressure in the right reservoir evolves with time .",

    "the prediction of eq .  , which is valid in the dilute limit , agrees well with the md data at @xmath62 . for the high concentration @xmath63 , however , the md data departs from the prediction of eq .   and takes smaller values .",
    "the prediction of eq .",
    "is evaluated by numerically integrating the concentration profiles of the md results .",
    "since the solute and solvent particles considered here are mechanically identical , the mobility is independent of the concentration , and thus @xmath15 cancels out in eq .  .",
    "typical concentration profiles are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : osmosis](c ) for @xmath43 , together with the boltzmann distribution valid in the dilute limit , @xmath64 .",
    "the deviation from the boltzmann distribution at @xmath63 is a non - linear effect due to high concentration .",
    "the interaction between solute particles becomes significant , and it causes the oscillations visible in the concentration profile , similar to fluid density oscillations that generally occur near solid surfaces ;  @xcite taking into account this effect , eq .   accurately predicts the reflection coefficient as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : osmosis](b ) .",
    "this demonstrates the usefulness of the theoretical prediction for wide concentration ranges beyond the dilute regime , once the concentration profiles are measured or estimated .",
    "in this section we now consider diffusio - osmosis , _",
    "i.e. _ the flow induced by solute gradients , but now tangential to a solid surface .",
    "we perform molecular dynamics of diffusio - osmosis for dense solute concentrations . to this end",
    "we introduce a new methodology allowing to simulate the effect of chemical potential gradients numerically .      the geometry under consideration is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geo_comp](a ) , with a chemical potential gradient applied parallel to the surface . in the bulk region ,",
    "the total force is zero yet solute and solvent fluxes are observed .",
    "the solute concentration in a layer adjacent to the surface deviates from that in the bulk , because of either a preferential adsorption or a depletion of the solute .",
    "the force unbalance in the thin layer is the driving force of the diffusio - osmotic flow .",
    "as shown in the first paper of the series , @xcite the fluid velocity is linearly proportional to the chemical potential gradient , according to @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the fluid viscosity , @xmath67 is the concentration in the bulk region sufficiently far from the surface , and @xmath68 is the chemical potential gradient .",
    "this formula correctly recovers the classical result for the dilute solution .",
    "@xcite the diffusio - osmotic mobility @xmath69 , relating the velocity @xmath70 far from the surface to the gradient of the chemical potential as @xmath71 , is then given by @xmath72 the mobility @xmath69 is negative for an excess surface concentration at the interface , _",
    "i.e. _ , the flow of solvent goes towards the low chemical potential area . respectively",
    ", it is positive if there is a surface depletion , and the flow reverses .",
    "note that in the case of slip at the interface with typical slip length @xmath73 , a slip velocity adds to eq .",
    ", such that @xmath69 is enhanced by a factor @xmath74 , with @xmath75 the thickness of the diffusion layer .",
    "@xcite      in this section , our goal is to develop a method to simulate directly diffusio - osmosis on the basis of non - equilibrium md ( nemd ) simulations .",
    "this implies to generate the diffusio - osmotic flow by applying an external field that is consistent with the application of a chemical potential gradient @xmath76 .",
    "a key characteristic of diffusio - osmosis , like all interfacially driven flows  including electro- or thermo - osmosis flows  @xcite  , is that it is a force - free transport phenomenon .",
    "this can be demonstrated from the fact that the hydrodynamic velocity profile is flat far away from the surface , so that all forces acting on the surface  direct interactions and hydrodynamics ",
    "do vanish accordingly , if any force is applied to the system ( solute+solvent ) , it should be balanced so that the total force acting on the fluid should vanish in the bulk region .",
    "this is obviously in contrast with the pressure driven flow . in the md simulations , for the latter case , an external force @xmath77 is applied commonly to each particle in the fluid , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geo_comp](c ) .  @xcite the applied pressure gradient , _",
    "i.e. _ , the force per volume , is then identified as @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the number of particles ,    to simulate diffusio - osmosis , we accordingly propose the following scheme , where we apply a differential force on the solute and on the solvent , see fig .",

[",
    "fig : geo_comp](b ) .",
    "the counter force therefore ensures the force balance in the bulk volume @xmath85 .",
    "the external force strength is then related to the chemical potential gradient as @xmath86 as is confirmed below via the green  kubo approach .",
    "we now validate this methodology on the basis of the linear response theory . indeed due to the onsager symmetry",
    ", one expects that the same diffusio - osmotic mobility will relate two symmetric situations : on the one hand , the solvent flow under a solute chemical gradient , and on the other hand , the ( excess ) solute flux under a pressure drop .",
