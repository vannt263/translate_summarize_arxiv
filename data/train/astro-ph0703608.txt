    "the asteroid and kuiper belts lie in regions of the solar system that are stable over long timescales to the gravitational perturbations of the planets ( lecar et al .",
    "dust produced in collisions between planetesimals in these belts inhabits a broader distribution , but one that is strongly influenced by the same gravitational perturbations ( dermott et al . 1994 ; liou & zook 1999 ; moro - martn & malhotra 2003 ) .",
    "these belts are thought to have started off with more than 200 times their present mass ( stern 1996 ; bottke et al . 2005 ) and it is speculated that the belts were depleted in the same event that caused the late heavy bombardment ( lhb ) .",
    "the lhb was a period of @xmath4 myr duration that occurred 700 myr after the solar system formed when the terrestrial planets were bombarded with a large influx of comets and asteroids , possibly due to restructuring of the planetary system in a dynamical instability ( gomes et al .",
    "the evolution of these planetesimal belts since this event is thought to have been relatively slow , with mass falling off due to collisional processing , but with large spikes in the dust content of the inner solar system occurring when two large asteroids collided ( nesvorn et al .",
    "2003 ; farley et al .",
    "knowledge of the planetesimal and dust content of the solar system and how it evolves thus provides a rich source of information about both the planetesimals themselves and the planetary system in which they reside .",
    "it is important to determine the evolution of the planetesimal belts around other stars , since this may be equally illuminating as to the nature and evolution of their planetary systems .",
    "surveys have been undertaken to determine this evolution , by measuring the infrared flux from dust produced in the collisional destruction of those planetesimals ( aumann et al .",
    "the observations are used to derive basic properties of the dust belts , such their infrared luminosity @xmath5 ( quoted as fractional luminosity , @xmath6 ) , and the distance of the dust from the star ( which is either the same as , or strongly dependent on , the planetesimal belt radius @xmath7 ) , and these are then compared with stellar properties , such as age and spectral type .",
    "most studies have focussed on the evolution of dust luminosity , showing that fractional luminosity decreases with age ; e.g. , spangler et al . (",
    "2001 ) found the mean dust luminosity of disks of similar age falls off @xmath8 , while greaves & wyatt ( 2003 ) inferred from detection statistics that the mass falls off @xmath9 , najita & williams ( 2005 ) found the mass of the detected disks falls off @xmath10 , and the upper limit in 24 @xmath1 m of the a star disks was found to fall off @xmath10 ( rieke et al .",
    "2005 ) , while disk mass from far - ir statistics was inferred to be relatively age independent in the range 30 - 1000 myr ( rhee et al .",
    "these results are thus in general agreement with the results of theoretical models , which show that a planetesimal belt evolving in quasi - steady state would lose mass due to collisional grinding down giving a disk mass ( and dust luminosity ) that falls off @xmath10 ( dominik & decin 2003 ; wyatt et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "however , decin et al .",
    "( 2003 ) noted that the maximum luminosity of debris disks remains constant at @xmath11 even for the oldest stars , and this was explained by dominik & decin ( 2003 ) as a consequence of delayed stirring , in which dust is not produced in the planetesimal belt until pluto - sized objects form and ignite a collisional cascade .",
    "since planet formation models predict that such massive bodies take longer to form further from the star ( kenyon & bromley 2004 ) , that interpretation makes the prediction that the radius of the belts should increase with stellar age , and more recent surveys have also considered the evolution of radius . while in sub - mm surveys there is as yet no evidence of any evolution of radius with age ( najita & williams 2005 ; williams & andrews 2006 ) , the latest far - ir results for a stars do appear to show some evidence that radius is increasing with age , based on the fact that excess emission is detected at much later ages at 70 @xmath1 m than at 24 @xmath1 m",
    "( su et al . 2006 ) .",
    "it has also been suggested that much of the dust we see in some systems is produced episodically in collisions between large planetesimals , much in the same way dust in the zodiacal cloud increases when collisions occur in the asteroid belt , and that such collisions contribute to the large spread in the infrared luminosities seen in disks around a stars of similar age ( rieke et al . 2005 ) .",
    "this scenario is supported by the discovery of a population of dust grains around vega in the process of removal by radiation pressure which indicates that this system can not have remained in steady - state for the full 350 myr age of the star ( su et al .",
    "more recently it has also been shown that the few sun - like stars with hot dust at a few au ( gaidos 1999 ; beichman et al .",
    "2005 ; song et al . 2005 ; wyatt et al . 2005 ) must be transient , since they are too bright for their age to be planetesimal belts that have evolved due to steady - state collisional processing ; such systems may be undergoing periods analogous to the lhb in the solar system ( wyatt et al . 2007 ) .",
    "a stochastic element to disk evolution would introduce additional free parameters in models and would complicate interpretation of the observed statistics if it plays a major role .",
    "it has thus not yet been possible to arrive at a consistent picture for debris disk evolution . the fact that surveys are undertaken for different spectral types , at different wavelengths , with different sensitivities to detections ,",
    "has also added confusion to the interpretation of the statistics . in this paper",
    "we revisit a simple analytical model for the steady - state collisional evolution of planetesimal belts which was originally explored in dominik & decin ( 2003 ) and recast with slightly modified assumptions in wyatt et al .",
    "this model , including how it is applied in this paper to populations of debris disks , is given in ",
    "[ s : model ] . in  [ s : rieke ] we build a model for the population of disks around a stars which is constrained using the 24 @xmath1 m statistics presented in rieke et al .",

    "2006 ) and the model parameters fine - tuned .",
    "these results indicate that , with the exception of a few outlier systems , the available statistics can be fitted by steady - state collisional evolution without having to invoke a major role for stochasticity or delayed stirring .",

    "the planetesimal belt is assumed to be in collisional equilibrium with a size distribution defined by : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is 11/6 for an infinite collisional cascade ( dohnanyi 1969 ) , and @xmath14 is the diameter of the planetesimals in km . that distribution is assumed to hold from the largest planetesimal in the disk , of diameter @xmath15 ( in km ) , down to the size below which particles are blown out by radiation pressure as soon as they are created , @xmath16 ( in @xmath1 m ) .",
    "if @xmath13 is in the range 5/3 to 2 then most of the mass is in the largest planetesimals while the cross - sectional area is dominated by the smallest particles such that for spherical particles of density @xmath17 in kg m@xmath18 : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is in au@xmath21 and @xmath22 is in @xmath23 and the rest of the units are as described above and are used consistently throughout the paper .    the planetesimal belt is assumed to be at a radius , @xmath7 , and have a width @xmath24 , both in units of au .",
    "assuming that the grains act like black bodies , and so absorb all the radiation they intercept , the fractional luminosity , @xmath6 , of the dust emission is given by @xmath25 in other words , in this model @xmath20 , @xmath22 , and @xmath26 are all proportional to each other and just one is needed to define the scaling factor @xmath27 in equation ( [ eq : nd ] ) .    assuming the particles act like black bodies also allows us to write down some other simple relations : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are in solar units . also the emission from the disk at a wavelength @xmath31",
    "is given by : @xmath32 where d is the distance to the star in pc , giving @xmath33 in jy if the planck function @xmath34 is in jy sr@xmath35 .",
    "the dust temperature can be worked out from : @xmath36 in k. the emission from the star at the same wavelength is given by : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is in k.    in a collisional cascade the amount of material within a given size range @xmath14 to @xmath39 decreases as these planetesimals are destroyed in collisions with other members of the cascade , but is replaced at the same rate by fragments created from the collisional destruction of larger objects .",
    "the long - timescale evolution is thus determined by the removal of mass from the top end of the cascade . in this model",
    "the scaling factor @xmath27 ( and so the total mass and fractional luminosity ) decreases as the number of planetesimals of size @xmath15 decreases .",

    "the remaining parameters , @xmath53 , @xmath7 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 were chosen from distributions for a population of a large number of disks ( 10,000 in this case ) .",
    "for each disk the stellar spectral type was chosen at random from the appropriate range ( i.e. , b8-a9 for comparison with the sample of rieke et al .",
    "2005 ) , thus defining @xmath29 , @xmath30 and so @xmath16 . the distribution of initial disk masses , @xmath53 , was based on the results of andrews & williams ( 2005 ) who did a sub - mm study of proto - planetary disks in the taurus - auriga star forming region , i.e. , for @xmath65 stars , from which they derived that this population has a log - normal distribution of dust masses that is centred on @xmath66 and has a @xmath67 width of 1.14 dex .",
    "we used the same distribution but allowed @xmath68 to be different from that found in taurus - auriga , and this was a free parameter . for the distribution of disk radii ,",
    "a power law distribution @xmath69 in the range 3 - 120 au was adopted , where @xmath70 is the number of disks with radii in the range @xmath7 to @xmath71 .",
    "the range 3 - 120 au was chosen from the range of radii inferred for the sample of 46 a star disks with radius estimates ( table [ tab:2470sample ] ) , and the exponent @xmath72 was determined from a fit to the observations .",
    "the mass evolution of each disk was then completely defined using equations ( [ eq : tcmtot ] ) and ( [ eq : mtott ] ) , and its properties at the current epoch were determined by assigning an age , @xmath57 , randomly from the appropriate range ( i.e. , 0 - 800 myr for a stars ) .",
    "the stars were also assigned a random distance in the range 0 - 45 pc assuming an isotropic distribution ( i.e. , @xmath73 ) ; given that there are @xmath4 a stars within 45 pc , the model is overpopulated by a factor of around 100 compared with the real population ( although note that distance only becomes important in this paper in  [ s : pred ] ) .",
    "the free parameters in this population model are thus : @xmath68 , @xmath72 , @xmath15 , @xmath41 , and @xmath48 .",
    "here the debris disk population model of  [ s : model ] is applied to the statistics of the incidence of disks around a stars presented in rieke et al .",
    "( 2005 ) based on observations at 24 @xmath1 m . there are two main aims .",
    "the first , which is described in the rest of this section , is to determine if these statistics can be reproduced with steady - state evolution of the disks , and if so to set constraints on the physical properties and starting conditions of the disks in that population .",
    "the second is to use the resulting model population to make predictions for the properties of a star disks found in surveys at other wavelengths and to determine if this simple model can explain the trends seen in the data .",
    "this is described in   [ s : rsst05pred ] and [ s : pred ] , where the model parameters are also fine - tuned .",
    "rieke et al .",
    "( 2005 ) searched a sample of 76 individual main sequence a stars and a number of young stellar clusters for excess 24 @xmath1 m emission above photospheric levels using spitzer and combined the data with archival results from iras for a total sample size of 266 a stars .",
    "they also determined the ages of all stars in a consistent manner thus providing a very useful sample from which to study the evolution of debris around a stars .",
    "their main result was a plot of @xmath74 versus age for all objects which showed a decrease in the upper envelope @xmath75 myr@xmath76 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rsst05 ] ) .",
    "the statistics were further quantified by splitting the sample into three age bins ( @xmath77 myr , @xmath78 myr and @xmath79 myr ) , and classifying sources as either having small excess ( @xmath80 ) , medium excess ( @xmath81 ) or large excess ( @xmath82 ) ( see their fig . 3 and our middle fig .",
    "[ fig : rsst05 ] ) .",
    "data on 12 objects was also presented at 70 @xmath1 m ( see their fig . 2 and our bottom fig .  [",
    "fig : rsst05 ] for a different version of this data ) .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     bottom fig .",
    "[ fig : scuba2 ] shows the histogram of the 850 @xmath1 m fluxes of the model population ( noting that this population should be representative of the scuba-2 survey sources , since all are within 45 pc ) .",
    "the model predicts that 17 of the 100 stars in the scuba-2 a star sample should have a flux above the detection threshold of 2 mjy .",
    "of those 17 : five would be expected above 10 mjy , and eight in the range 3 - 10 mjy , with the remaining four detected with @xmath83 confidence at 2 - 3 mjy .",
    "the histogram also shows the sub - mm flux distribution for the 3 a stars already detected , showing that we already know of 2 stars within 45 pc with fluxes above 10 mjy ( hd172167 , hd216956 ) , while we know of just one in the range 3 - 10 mjy ( hd14055 ) .",
    "thus the scuba-2 survey is expected to discover three new bright disks @xmath84 mjy , but can expect to find a further seven new disks at 3 - 10 mjy levels .",
    "the @xmath84 mjy sources are particularly interesting , since at such a level of flux it is possible to resolve the structure of the disks ( holland et al .",
    "1998 ; wyatt et al . 2005 ) , and indeed the model predicts that 60% of these will have an angular size of @xmath85 ( noting that all may be larger than this given that the black body assumption underestimates the true disk size by a factor of up to three , schneider et al .",
    "it is also possible to extract some information on the spatial distribution of the 3 - 10mjy sources , e.g. , giving a direct measure of the size and inclination of the disk ( greaves et al .",
    "2004 ) , with around 23% of these predicted to be larger than 6 .",
    "it may even be possible to extract information from the 83 stars without detected disks , since they are predicted to have a mean flux of 0.60 mjy , of which 0.26 mjy is the mean disk flux and 0.34 mjy is the mean stellar flux .",
    "by co - adding their data , the statistical noise level would be reduced to @xmath86 mjy , suggesting that it should be possible to get a positive detection of the photospheric emission , and also to discern if there is an excess coming from the disks with @xmath87 confidence . however , contamination from extragalactic sources that lie within the scuba-2 beam would have a signal of comparable magnitude to the mean disk flux and would reduce our ability to make a conclusive detection of disk emission from this population .",
    "the model predicts that there will be little age dependence within the sample of disks detected by scuba-2 , in agreement with the result of rhee et al .",
    "( 2007 ) who estimated the mass evolution based on far - ir observations .",
    "for example , the model predicts that the mean age of the detected sample is @xmath88 myr ( compared with 400 myr for the whole population ) , with a roughly even number of disks ( 8 - 9 ) detected in both the @xmath89 myr and @xmath90 myr age bins , which will be indistinguishable from that expected if there were no age dependence ( 6 in the @xmath89 myr and 11 in the @xmath90 myr samples ) .",
    "naturally scuba-2 is inclined to detect disks with low values of @xmath91 , i.e. , those for which their emission is more like black body ( which would be inferred to be composed of large grains ) .",
    "however , given the small range in @xmath91 observed , this dependence is very slight and would affect mainly those disks detected close to the sensitivity threshold .",
    "there is also predicted to be a small spectral type dependence , in that 19% of stars later than a3v are predicted to be detected by scuba-2 , compared with 15% of those earlier than a3v .",
    "this arises because , while disks of lower fractional luminosity can be detected around earlier type stars , @xmath92 ( equation [ eq : fdet2 ] ) , the fractional luminosities of their dust belts are also much lower because of the higher dust blow - out radius , @xmath93 ( equation [ eq : fmax1 ] ) .",
    "we do not anticipate that this would be detectable within the a star sample , however , it suggests that the detectability of sun - like stars could be high , should their disk population be described by the same parameters as for the a stars .",
    "top figure [ fig : scuba2 ] also shows the 24 and 70 @xmath1 m detection limits of the spitzer survey of su et al . ( 2006 ) .",
    "this shows that almost without exception ( 99.9% ) the disks that can be detected by scuba-2 at 850 @xmath1 m are also detectable by spitzer observations at 70 @xmath1 m with a detection threshold of @xmath94 , while most ( 61% ) of those detectable by scuba-2 are also detectable by spitzer at 24 @xmath1 m . in other words ,",
    "ten of the 100 a stars in the scuba-2 sample should be detectable at 24 , 70 and 850 @xmath1 m , while seven should be detectable at 70 and 850 @xmath1 m , but not at 24 @xmath1 m ; the combination of sub - mm and far - ir data would be very important for constraining the dust temperature in these disks .",
    "while this suggests that the survey could equally well be done at 70 @xmath1 m , there are three important points to consider . *",
    "( i ) * first , not all of the sample has been observed with spitzer - the su et al .",
    "( 2006 ) sample includes 42 sources within 45 pc ( of which 20 were detected at 70 @xmath1 m ) , which assuming even coverage across the sky means that 34 of these should fall in the scuba-2 survey ( which has declination limits of @xmath95 and @xmath96 ) .",
    "this implies that two thirds of the scuba-2 a star sources have not previously been searched for disks in the far - ir ( although bright disks may have turned up in iras surveys which have a detection threshold well above that shown in fig .  [ fig : scuba2 ] ) .",
    "it is also not possible to scrutinize all stars with spitzer to the level of @xmath97 due to cirrus confusion .",
    "thus it is predicted that the scuba-2 survey will turn up a significant number of genuinely new discoveries . *",
    "( ii ) * second , it is important to emphasize the unbiased nature of the scuba-2 survey .",
    "several sources have recently been identified as possessing excess emission in the sub - mm even when no excess is present in far - ir surveys ( wyatt et al . 2003 ; holmes et al . 2003 ; najita & williams 2005 ) .",
    "these disks must be cool ( @xmath98k ) and at large radius ; e.g. , extrapolation of the detection thresholds in fig .",
    "[ fig : scuba2 ] to larger radii indicates that the sub - mm is more sensitive than 70 @xmath1 m surveys to disks that are @xmath99 au at 5pc for a0v stars and @xmath100 au at 5 pc for a9v stars .",
    "since the model population was constrained by 24 and 70 @xmath1 m surveys , there was no need to invoke a population of disks of large radius , although we know that dust exists around young a stars to hundreds of au ( kalas & jewitt 1995 ; clampin et al .",
    "thus the predicted detection statistics should be viewed as a lower limit , with many large disks being detected at 850 @xmath1 m which can not be detected in the far - ir .",
    "previous unbiased sub - mm surveys suggest that @xmath101% of stars could have disks too cold to detect in the far - ir , which could push the detection rate to @xmath102% for the scuba-2 a star survey . *",
    "( iii ) * even discounting the ultra - cool disks discussed in ( ii ) , the sub - mm statistics will set important constraints on the distribution of the planetesimal belt radii , since the predictions made here are very sensitive to that distribution .",
    "for example , with a radius distribution @xmath103 , which is not ruled out in the present study at the @xmath67 confidence level , the model would predict that 22 of the 100 a stars would be detected at @xmath104 mjy of which 7 would be @xmath84 mjy .",
    "a simple model for the steady - state evolution of dust luminosity for planetesimal belts evolving due to collisions was described in  [ s : model ] .",
    "this section also described how the model could be applied to determine the properties of the disks of a population of stars , given that these disks would have had a range of initial properties .",
    "this was applied in  [ s : rieke ] to the population of a stars that was searched for evidence of dust emission at 24 @xmath1 m by rieke et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , and it was shown that their detection statistics as a function of age could be reproduced with a model population in which the largest planetesimals have a size of @xmath105 km , and all planetesimals have a strength of @xmath106 j kg@xmath35 and an eccentricity of @xmath107",
    ". however , these parameters should not be over - interpreted , since the observable properties of the model population remain the same as long as the combination @xmath108 is unchanged .",
    "thus more detailed models of the collisional evolution of planetesimal belts ( e.g. , krivov , sremcevi & spahn 2005 ) are needed to interpret these parameters , e.g. , in terms of the composition of the planetesimal belts .",
    "for now we note that these are reasonable parameters based on planetesimal ( benz & asphaug 1999 ) and planet formation models ( kenyon & bromley 2002 ) . the model used as input a distribution of planetesimal belt starting masses that is log - normal with the same width ( @xmath67 of 1.14 dex ) as inferred for proto - planetary disks ( andrews & williams 2005 ) , and found such",
    "a distribution would have to be centred on @xmath109 .",
    "this mass is consistent with that expected for proto - planetary disks around a stars , although the observable properties of the model population are also reproduced as long as @xmath110 is unchanged . in other words , the observable 24 @xmath1 m properties of main sequence",
    "a star disks can be explained by the steady - state evolution of a disk population with realistic starting parameters ( although more extreme solutions are also possible ) .    in  [ s : rsst05pred ] this model",
    "was tested against its predictions for the 70 @xmath1 m properties of the disks in this population .",
    "these were found to reproduce the statistics of the su et al .",
    "( 2006 ) survey which showed a much longer decay timescale for the 70 @xmath1 m excess than for that at 24 @xmath1 m .",
    "the model was also used to predict the properties of the sub - sample of disks that could be detected at both 24 and 70 @xmath1 m , and this was compared with a sample of 46 a stars compiled from the literature for which excess emission has been detected at both 24 and 70 @xmath1 m .",
    "the model reproduces and explains the distribution of the observed disks on the @xmath26 vs @xmath7 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fvsr ] ) , @xmath26 vs @xmath57 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fvst ] ) and @xmath7 vs @xmath57 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rvst ] ) plots , including an upper envelope in the @xmath26 vs @xmath7 plot that increases @xmath111 , a decay in the mean luminosity of disks with age @xmath112 , and a mean radius of detected disks that , if anything , increases with age @xmath113 .",
    "thus it appears that the wide range in typical disk properties can be explained without appealing to stochasticity .",
    "the large spread in 24 @xmath1 m fractional excess at any age ( rieke et al . 2005 ) can occur naturally from a spread in initial disk masses and radii , and the slower fall - off at 70 @xmath1 m and more detailed distributions of the properties of disks detected at 24 and 70 @xmath1 m ( su et al .",
    "2006 ) could be the consequence of the detection bias .",
    "this bias is best explained on the plot of @xmath26 vs @xmath7 , on which it is possible to plot the lines above which disks must lie to be detected at 24 and 70 @xmath1 m , and below which they must lie for a given age .",
    "one illustrative example of this bias is the fact that while in the model the planetesimal belt of any individual star does not change in radius , the mean radius of detected planetesimal belts is predicted to increase with age .",
    "the reason is that planetesimal belts that are closest to the star are processed faster and so fall below the detection threshold much faster than planetesimal belts that are farther from the star .",
    "thus if such a trend is seen it would not necessarily be evidence for delayed stirring , in which the collisional cascade is only initiated once enough time has elapsed for pluto - sized objects to form , a process which takes longer further from the star ( e.g. , kenyon & bromley 2002 ; dominik & decin 2003 ) .",
    "rather it could be evidence that the processing of the planetesimal belt is occurring inside - out , as inferred by su et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "this does not rule out the possibility that some , or even all , a star debris disks in the rieke et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and su et al .",
    "( 2006 ) samples are undergoing transient events on top of the overall trend established by the model .",
    "in fact , there are a few disks that may ( rather than must ) require this mechanism to explain their properties .",
    "the potentially transient systems identified in this paper are : hd3003 , hd38678 , and hd172555 , which have high luminosity for their age ; as well as hd115892 , which has unusually an low radius for its age .",
    "all of these systems are identifiable by their high value of @xmath2 , where @xmath59 is the maximum possible fractional luminosity that a disk can have given its age and radius ( assuming the planetesimal belt properties inferred for the rest of the population ) .",
    "we also found that the disks of hd2262 and hd106591 have unusually low radii for their age , and suggested that this may be attributable to the action of p - r drag on dust produced in their dust belts , since this starts to become important when @xmath114 , and these belts ( along with hd115892 and hd19356 ) can be identified from the sample as having @xmath115 .",
    "neither do the results in this paper imply that the collisional cascade in all a star planetesimal belts must have been initiated soon ( @xmath116 myr ) after the stars formed , rather than the collisional cascade being initiated after a delay of several 10s or 100s of myr in some systems ( i.e. , the delayed stirring model ) . indeed ,",
    "if the lack of large radii disks at young ages is confirmed ( rhee et al . 2007 ) , this would support some role for delayed stirring in debris disk evolution .",
    "analysis of the distribution of @xmath2 of the 46 a star disks detected at both 24 and 70 @xmath1 m shows a distribution that may be attributed to the planetesimal belts not having exactly the same properties , but having a distribution in the combination of parameters given by @xmath108 ( which is also the combination in the parameter @xmath59 ) that is log - normal with a @xmath67 width of 1 dex .",
    "this means two things : first , that the distribution of parameters of these a stars is quite uniform .",
    "this is perhaps to be expected if the planetesimals in all belts are of similar composition , and grow to a similar maximum size before perturbations from the largest member of the cascade ( around 2000 km ) stir the rest of the planetesimal belt resulting in eccentricities of similar magnitude ( e.g. , kenyon & bromley 2002 ) .",
    "second , that the anomalous systems identified in the last paragraph are only @xmath117 anomalies in that they may be explained as disks with higher than average planetesimal strength or size , or lower than average eccentricity . in contrast , this analysis strengthens the result of wyatt et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , in which the dust emission from several sun - like stars , such as hd69830 , was inferred to be transient , since if the planetesimal belts of sun - like stars are described by similar properties to those of a stars , then all of the disks they inferred to be transient have @xmath118 and each one would be a @xmath119 anomaly ( and yet such disks are found around @xmath120% of stars ) . however , given current limits in definitive detection of transient events , the derived incidence is probably a lower limit .",
    "one particularly interesting outcome of the model is the distribution of radii of the planetesimal belts .",
    "the model assumed a power law distribution of radii in the range 3 - 120 au , and found from the distribution of radii of the sample detected at 24 and 70 @xmath1 m , that this follows @xmath3 .",
    "it was found to be important to take the detection bias into account when interpreting the observed distribution .",
    "the origin of this distribution is not considered in this model , which assumes that all stars have relatively narrow planetesimal belts with @xmath121 .",
    "the inner hole in these belts has been inferred in other studies to be caused by the presence of inner planets ( e.g. , roques et al . 1994 ; wyatt et al . 1999 ; wilner et al .",
    "2002 ; wyatt 2003 ; quillen 2006 ) . if these are kuiper belt analogues ( wyatt et al .",
    "2003 ) , then this radius distribution would be indicative of the orbital radius of the outermost planet in its planetary system . however , these could also be asteroid belt analogues , i.e. , planetesimal belts in the midst of a planetary system .",
    "if so the interpretation of this radius distribution is less clear , and could , like the solar system for example , be indicative of the orbital radius of the most massive giant planet in these systems . in any case , this distribution provides an important and unique constraint on the outcome of planet formation models .",
    "another particularly powerful application of the model is that , regardless of the physical reason , it does explain the far - ir properties of a star disks and so it can also be used to make predictions for what surveys at other wavelengths ( or with different detection thresholds ) will see .",
    "such predictions are made much easier when the survey detection threshold is uniform , or at least can be readily characterized , and this study emphasizes the importance of a characterizable threshold for future surveys .",
    "one such survey is the scuba-2 debris disks survey ( matthews et al .",
    "2007 ) , which will include an unbiased sub - mm survey of the 100 nearest a stars to a uniform @xmath122 sensitivity of 2 mjy at 850 @xmath1 m .",
    "the model predicts that 17 of the 100 will be detected above 2 mjy , including 5 above 10 mjy , and that 5 of the detected disks should be resolvable in sub - mm imaging on size scales @xmath85 .",
    "however , the detected fraction could be higher than this , since it depends on the radius distribution , which these observations would set strong constraints on .",
    "it is also unknown how many a stars possess disks too cold to detect in the far - ir ( wyatt , dent & greaves 2003 ; najita & williams 2005 ) .",
    "this suggests that the scuba-2 survey will be particularly fruitful , and the model presented here provides a framework which can be used to interpret the results of this survey , and those of future surveys ."
