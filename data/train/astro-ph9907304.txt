    "recent works support the hierarchical galaxy formation theory , in which massive galaxies form by subsequent mergers of smaller systems ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in the context of understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies , compact groups ( cgs ) play an eminent role and can be regarded as a unique laboratory for the study of galaxy interactions , tidally triggered starburst or active galactic nuclei ( agn ) activity , and the merging of galaxies .",
    "cgs combine low velocity dispersions ( compared to galaxy clusters ) , small size and high spatial density .",
    "this combination suggests that interactions and mergers should occur frequently in these groups .",
    "details of these processes are , however , under lively discussion and , particularly , the latest stages of the evolution of cgs are widely unknown .",
    "the reason is that known high - density cgs are scarce ; however , there are examples like parts of hcg 94 ( @xcite ) and of hcg 95 ( @xcite ; @xcite )",
    ".    as to remnants of cgs , results are even more meager : only two fossil cgs have been found and the coalescence processes that lead to the expected bright field ellipticals appear to proceed much slower than anticipated ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . for our understanding of the processes it is important to find and study at least one cg that shows , as a whole , characteristics of a very advanced phase of evolution .",
    "our observations indicate that we have found the most promising candidate yet .",
    "it was recognized by us as a morphologically unusual object ( @xcite ) and will be called cg1720 - 67.8 .",
    "for the study in this paper we used both imaging and spectroscopic data . a 900 sec v frame ( centered at @xmath2  ; seeing 1.8 arcsec )",
    "was obtained at the du pont 2.5m - telescope of las campanas observatory , equipped with a 2048@xmath3 pixel@xmath3 tek5 ccd having a pixel - size of 24 @xmath4 m and giving a resolution of 0.259 arcsec / pixel in an 8@xmath5 field of view .",
    "the frame was processed by means of the potsdam image processing system .",
    "this package includes both a standard reduction procedure and a laplacian adaptive filtering procedure .",
    "this adaptive filtering method , developed to suppress the background noise and to distinctly enhance faint structures hidden in strong long - scale luminosity variations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , allows to put in evidence details of extended objects as well as faint objects otherwise not clearly visible on an image .",
    "two long - slit spectra ( 1800 sec and 1500 sec ) , taken under good seeing conditions ( @xmath6 in the second case ) were obtained in may 1997 at the mpi 2.2 m telescope in la silla , and in february 1998 at the du pont 2.5 m telescope of las campanas observatory , respectively . for the former spectrum we had a spatial resolution of 0.26 arcsec / pixel and a dispersion of 2  / pixel over the range 3850 - 8000  ;",
    "the spectral resolution was @xmath7  .",
    "for the latter spectrum the spatial resolution was 0.56 arcsec / pixel and the dispersion 2 / pixel over the range 3770 - 7180 ; the spectral resolution was @xmath8  .",
    "the standard stars ltt 7379 and cd -32d9927 were used to perform the flux calibration .",
    "the standard reduction steps ( mean bias subtraction , flat field correction , wavelength calibration , and atmospheric extinction correction ) as well as line flux and position measurements were carried out by means of the iraf packages .",
    "the spectra of all the galaxies of the group show emission lines and , in two cases , pronounced absorption lines too .",
    "emission line fluxes were measured after a template spectrum of the underlying stellar component , obtained from a composition of elliptical galaxy spectra and conveniently diluted to best fit the absorption features , had been subtracted from the spectra , following @xcite .",
    "particular care was taken to uncover the h@xmath9 emission line , which is embedded in the corresponding balmer absorption line feature .",
    "a further correction was applied to eliminate the telluric atmospheric absorption bands falling at the wavelength of h@xmath10 .",
    "in figure 1 , we present the ccd @xmath11 frame : the image as reduced in the standard way is shown in figure 1a , its filtered counterpart , displayed with contour lines and with spectral slit positions superposed ( see below ) is presented in 1b and as a color image in figure 1c .    a wealth of details is visible : the brightest object is an elliptical galaxy ( no .",
    "2 ) ; the next brightest galaxy ( no . 4 ) also appears to be of elliptical type in figure 1a , but shows a more complicated structure in figure 1b and 1c , where one notices an elongated ( double ? ) nucleus and outer contours that are reminiscent of two ( disk ) galaxies that have almost merged .",
    "1 , the third - brightest galaxy is disturbed by no .",
    "2 , looks elliptical - like ( figure 1a ) , but shows some internal structure in figure 1c .",
    "most spectacular is the arc : at both ends there are distinct brightness enhancements ; the northern one ( the fourth - brightest object ) is numbered 3 , and the other 7 .",
    "5 , half - way between no . 4 and a star , either is the end of a tail connected to no .",
    "4 ( see figure 1c ) or is an individual object . a faint diffuse extended object is seen south - west of the star just mentioned , close to the western rim of figure 1c . finally , number 6 was assigned to a location where one slit position crossed the arc .",
    "cg1720 - 67.8 is very isolated : there is no obvious other galaxy within 11 times the diameter ( ca .",
    "30@xmath12 ) of this ensemble of galaxies ; the next cataloged galaxy is about 1@xmath13 away .",
    "the group shows a strikingly high degree of interactions between its member candidates .    although the @xmath11 frame was uncalibrated , comparison with the images on the serc j and eso r film copies allowed an estimate of the @xmath11-magnitudes of the brightest member candidates ( @xmath14 mag )",
    ": we estimate that the objects range from 17.5 ( no .",
    "2 ) , to 20.5 ( no .",
    "that is , the four brightest member candidates are within 3 mag , and the group is compact and isolated - it thus fulfills the criteria of @xcite compact groups .",
    "we found emission lines in all the objects ( nos . 1 - 6 ) of cg1720 - 67.8 covered by the slits and absorption lines in nos . 2 , 4 , 5 , and 6 .",
    "the spectra are available on astro.uibk.ac.at ( anonymous ftp ) in the directory /pub",
    "/ weinberger/. the emission line fluxes for the four brightest galaxies are listed in table 1 ; objects nos . 5 and 6 showed h@xmath15 and [ ] 6583 only .",
    "heliocentric radial velocities were determined from the emission lines ; they are in accord with the otherwise less accurate velocities derived from absorption lines .",
    "the calibration error , estimated from the mean deviation of the measured sky line positions from the predicted ones is @xmath16 km s@xmath1 for the spectrum taken at las campanas and @xmath17 km s@xmath1 for the one taken at eso .",
    "radial velocities derived from different lines were averaged using @xmath18 as weighting factor , where @xmath19 is the velocity error expressed as a function of the s / n of the relevant emission - line .",
    "the variation of @xmath19 as a function of s / n was derived using night - sky emission lines following the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "the thus calculated radial velocities , after application of the heliocentric correction and the associated errors are listed in table 1 .",
    "hence , the mean redshift of cg1720 - 67.8 is @xmath20 = 0.045 - and the distance of the group is 179.9 mpc ( with h@xmath21 = 75 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 , used throughout this paper ) .",
    "in order to attempt a classification of these emission - line galaxies , we made use of diagnostic diagrams ( @xcite ) .",
    "they are shown in figure 2 .",
    "usually , the [ ] /h@xmath15 vs. [ ] /h@xmath22 diagram ( figure 2b ) is considered to be most meaningful .",
    "we can thus infer from figure 2 that all the galaxies under examination , with the possible exception of no .",
    "2 , undergo star formation .",
    "we interpret this result as an indication of enhanced star formation possibly induced from tidal interactions : from studies of n - body simulations of galaxy encounters it is known that interactions drive large gas flows towards the center of galaxies , triggering massive nuclear star formation ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we carried out photoionization model calculations by means of cloudy90 ( @xcite ) and found the following logarithmic values of the electron density @xmath23 and the ionization parameter @xmath24 : 2.0,@xmath252.8 ; 2.0,@xmath253.5 ; 2.2,@xmath253.0 ; and 2.1 , @xmath263.7 for the galaxies nos . 1 - 4",
    ", respectively . in all four cases a non - lte mihalas stellar continuum with @xmath27 = 42000 k was assumed ( @xcite ) . as we could not properly fit the observed emission line ratios assuming solar abundances for objects nos . 2 and 4",
    ", we tried to vary the nitrogen ( n ) and sulfur ( s ) abundances .",
    "a best fit to the data was obtained assuming an n abundance of 0.5 ( solar units ) for no . 2 , and both n and s abundances of 0.5 for no .",
    "some deviations of [ ] /h@xmath15 and [ ] /h@xmath15 line ratios from typical galaxies suggest that photoionization is not the only ionization mechanism acting in these galaxies ; a possible interpretation would be the presence of shocks generated from stellar winds as a consequence of bursts of star formation ( @xcite ) .",
    "better spectroscopic data are needed to firmly establish the nature of the ionization mechanism .    to obtain an estimate of the star formation rates ( sfrs ) in the four most luminous objects ,",
    "the h@xmath15 luminosity has been calculated from h@xmath15 fluxes using the radial velocities listed in table 1 . according to @xcite , sfr = 7.07 10@xmath28@xmath29(h@xmath15 ) m@xmath30 yr@xmath1 , taking into account all stars from 0.1 to 100 m@xmath30 and providing a measure of the current sfr .    as the luminosity calculated refers to only to the portion of the galaxies sampled by the long - slit spectra ,",
    "the sfr values have been divided by the corresponding areas occupied by the single galaxies in the slit ( not taking into account the effects of seeing ) .",
    "anyway , it should be considered that if the sf processes are concentrated in restricted regions of a galaxy , the sfr per unit area declines with the size of the sampled region .",
    "an estimate of the number of ionizing photons required to produce the observed @xmath29(h@xmath15 ) is given by @xmath31 ) .",
    "this quantity can be expressed in equivalents of the number of o5 stars , @xmath32(o5 ) , assuming that each o5 star emits @xmath33 ionizing photons per sec ( @xcite ) .",
    "the values obtained by us ( table 2 ) are comparable to or even higher than those found in  giant \" or  supergiant \" extragalactic h ii regions , whose @xmath29(h@xmath15 ) are in the range @xmath34  @xmath35 erg s@xmath1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "hcgs prove to be of great significance for the understanding of interactions between galaxies and appear to be of key interest for studying the formation of new , bright field ellipticals .",
    "our data allow , e.g. , the determination of two very important parameters to characterize cgs , namely the median projected galaxy separation ( mps ) and the velocity dispersion ( @xmath36 ) : from our four brightest galaxies we found an mps of 6.9 kpc , much lower than 9.1 kpc for seyferts sextett ( hcg 79 ) , which is reported to be the most compact group ( @xcite ) , and velocity dispersions @xmath37 = 67 km s@xmath1 , and @xmath38 = 99 km s@xmath1 .",
    "median values for the hcgs are mps = 52 kpc , @xmath37 = 200 km s@xmath1 and @xmath38 = 331 km s@xmath1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the comparison thus convincingly shows that cg1720 - 67.8 is extreme with respect to these quantities .",
    "the fact that we found activity in all our hitherto observed member galaxies is , even if taken alone , remarkable and reminds of hcg 16 ( @xcite ) .",
    "such a wide - spread activity underlines the prevalence of interaction and merger processes in cg1720 - 67.8 .",
    "in addition , the prominent tail - obviously a tidal tail - that dominates the optical appearance of cg1720 - 67.8 , is a further proof of the ongoing interaction in this group .      from h@xmath15/h@xmath22 , after carefully having taken hydrogen absorption features into account , we found visual extinctions ( @xmath39 = 3.1@xmath40 ) , that are variable across the field and are partly astonishingly high : we found @xmath39 values of 0.8@xmath410.1 , 1.6@xmath411.2 , 3.2@xmath411.4 , and 2.0@xmath410.4 mag for objects 1 - 4 , respectively .",
    "the galactic foreground extinction is small : the remote ( @xmath427 kpc ) globular cluster ngc 6362 ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) , only about 1.3@xmath13 away from cg1720 - 67.8 , has a color excess @xmath45 = 0.11 only ( @xcite ) .",
    "provided that the derived extinctions represent the foreground obscuration of the respective galaxies , estimates of the absolute magnitudes of these galaxies are possible and the combined brightness of all these four galaxies ( together with a rough estimate of the remaining objects ) results in a total absolute magnitude of not more than @xmath2621.5 mag for cg1720 - 67.8 .",
    "strangely enough , there is no counterpart in the iras catalogs but a very vague hint for 60@xmath4 m emission in iras maps ( by the way , cg1720 - 67.8 also has no counterpart in radio or x - ray catalogs ) .",
    "why does the plenty of dust , which is responsible for the pronounced extinction , not emit in the iras bands ?",
    "we suggest , that it might be very cool dust that mainly radiates beyond 100@xmath4 m .",
    "if true , this may be due to dust in the group s halo , perhaps blown off by strong galactic winds .    from all pieces of evidence , taken together ,",
    "we conclude that cg1720 - 67.8 is in all probability a group of galaxies on the verge of coalescence .",
    "if we assume that the group will evolve into an elliptical galaxy , as is generally believed for compact groups ( @xcite ) , the end - product may hardly be a very bright field elliptical galaxy , but rather a moderately bright one .",
    "this ultra - dense compact group deserves thorough future studies - and objects of the same highly evolved species .",
