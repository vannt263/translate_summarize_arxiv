    "we investigate the preliminary orbit determination problem for a satellite of the earth using radar observations collected by an instrument with given technical specifications , and with a fixed observation scheduling .",
    "assume we collect the following data for the observed object : @xmath3 where the triples @xmath4 represent topocentric spherical coordinates of the object at epochs @xmath5 .",
    "typically @xmath6 are the values of right ascension and declination .",
    "we shall call _ radar track _ the set of observations in ( [ radtrail ] ) .",
    "the following assumptions will be made on the data composing the tracks .",
    "the time difference @xmath7 between consecutive observations is @xmath8 s. the range data @xmath9 are very precise : the statistical error in the range is given by its rms @xmath10 , which is @xmath11 m. on the other hand we assume that the angles @xmath6 are not precisely determined : their rms @xmath12 , @xmath13 are supposed to be @xmath14 degrees . given a radar track we can compute by interpolation the following data : @xmath15 here @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the mean values of the epoch and the angles , and @xmath1 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 are the values of a function @xmath21 and its derivatives at @xmath22 , where @xmath21 is given by a quadratic fit with the @xmath23 data .",
    "for low earth orbits ( leo ) these assumptions imply that the interpolated values of @xmath24 , @xmath25 are very badly accurate , to the point that their value can be of the same order of the errors , therefore they are practically undetermined .    by the above considerations , given a vector ( [ radinterp ] ) obtained by a radar track , and using spherical coordinates and velocities @xmath26 to describe the orbit , we can consider as unknowns the quantities @xmath27 , with @xmath28 where @xmath29 are small deviations from the mean values @xmath30 , @xmath31 .    to search for the values of the unknowns we need to use additional data : we can try to use the data of 2 radar tracks , together with a dynamical model , to compute one or more preliminary orbits .",
    "this is a _ linkage problem _ , see @xcite . in this paper",
    "we propose a new algorithm for the linkage , which takes advantage of the smallness of @xmath32 , that we call _ infinitesimal angles_. we write the equations for preliminary orbits by using the 5 algebraic integrals of kepler s problem , lambert s equation for elliptic motion ( see section  [ s : app ] ) and the projection of the equations of motion along the line of sight .",
    "moreover , we perform some tests to compare this method with gibbs method , using only one radar track , and with the keplerian integrals method , which solves a linkage problem using @xmath33 at two mean epochs ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we introduce some notation and recall the basic results on kepler s motion which are relevant for this work ( see sections  [ s : eqmotion ] , [ s:2body ] , [ s : lambert ] ) .",
    "the equations for the linkage problem , see ( [ complete ] ) , are presented in section [ s : linkage ] , and in sections  [ s : compx ] , [ s : compdelta ] we show two different ways to compute solutions of ( [ complete ] ) . in section  [ s : numexp ]",
    "we present the results of some numerical tests , including a comparison with the already known methods recalled in section  [ s : knownmethods ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ s : app ] , we recall the proof of lambert s theorem for elliptic orbits and give a geometrical interpretation of the results .",
    "moreover , we show a method to correct the observations of a radar track so that they correspond to points in the same plane .",
