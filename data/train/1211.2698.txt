    "the shape of @xmath142 , however , changes considerably . in the initial state and shortly after the switch - on of the field , the occupation is concentrated at low frequencies , as expected for a thermal state with @xmath151 .",

    "in a condensed matter system , dissipation of energy to lattice- , spin- , and other degrees of freedom is unavoidable , and can happen on sub - picosecond timescales .",
    "it is thus essential to understand which of the findings of the previous section will be robust against such processes .",
    "the steady states of dissipative systems with dc driving is itself an interesting area of research @xcite . within dmft",
    ", dissipation terms can be included phenomenologically , either by coupling a local fermionic bath @xcite or a bosonic ( `` phonon '' ) bath @xcite at fixed temperature . here",
    "we use the latter approach , since it guarantees particle number conservation and dissipates only energy .    following ref .",
    "@xcite , the electronic self - energy in this case is supplemented by a bath contribution , which is the lowest order diagram for a holstein - type electron - phonon coupling , @xmath155=\\lambda^2   g(t , t ' ) d(t , t')$ ] . here , @xmath156 measures the coupling strength , and @xmath157 is the equilibrium propagator for a boson with energy @xmath158 ; @xmath159/z $ ] .",
    "the temperature @xmath160 of the bath is fixed , such that the bath has no memory ( @xmath161 in the following ) .",
    "it is important to note that we choose @xmath162 for the phonon frequency , to prevent opening a new channel for doublon - hole recombination via phonon emission .",
    "in general , the precise way of including the dissipation should not matter too much , and we chose parameters such that the equilibrium physics remains almost unchanged by the presence of dissipation .",
    "( in contrast , for a fermionic bath in the wide - band limit the equilibrium state would be modified due to mid - gap states that are created in the spectrum of the insulator with dissipation @xcite . )",
    "figure [ fig - lambda]a compares the current @xmath1 at @xmath124 , with and without dissipation .",
    "in contrast to the isolated system ( @xmath163 ) , the current in a system with dissipation never becomes stationary , but it increases more or less linearly with time ( @xmath154 ) . based on the results of the previous sections , the explanation is straightforward : if the system can dissipate energy , doublons and holes will never reach @xmath164 , and the distribution @xmath165 never becomes flat .",
    "hence doublons and holes contribute to the current at all times .",
    "since their number is increasing due to the field - induced doublon - hole production , the current increases with time .",
    "the doublon - creation current @xmath8 , on the other hand , is not expected to depend strongly on the coupling to phonons with an energy @xmath166 .",
    "this is in fact true , as apparent from fig .",

    ", we include the dc curve @xmath72 for @xmath65 , taken from fig .",
    "[ fig - fth]a ( open symbols ) .",
    "both have the same slope , related to @xmath10.,width=604 ]    to design an experiment that can potentially measure the threshold behavior , one should account for the coupling of the sample to leads @xcite .",
    "doublons and holes can then escape through the boundary , such that their density in the sample becomes stationary and a true steady state is reached .",
    "( otherwise , the quasi - steady state would be quite short - lived : extrapolating the linear increase of @xmath19 in fig .",
    "[ fig - current_u5b5]b , e.g. , gives a time of a few 1000 until the uncorrelated value @xmath135 would be reached , corresponding to a few picoseconds for @xmath171 . )",
    "nevertheless , in the dc setup heating of the system is quite substantial , and the current will be a balance between non - perturbative doublon - hole production and dissipative effects . to avoid these complications , one could probe the strong field behavior by using short pulses , as already proposed for dielectrics ( band insulators ) @xcite .",
    "if the pulse frequency @xmath172 is below the mott gap , e.g. , in the thz range , the doublon production might be described by the dc results to a good approximation .",
    "if a weak external bias @xmath173 is applied to the sample in addition to the strong thz pulse , the induced charge is collected at the leads .",
    "the current , averaged over many thz pulses , would then be proportional to the total number @xmath170 of doublons created per pulse . in fig",
    "[ fig - thz ] , we have simulated the outcome of such an experiment ( as sketched in the inset ) . figure  [ fig - thz]a shows the time - evolution of the double occupancy during a single - cycle pulse @xmath174 centered around @xmath175 , with frequency @xmath176 , and a gaussian envelope ( see inset in fig .",
    "[ fig - thz]a ) . motivated by our results , we define an averaged doublon creation current @xmath177 . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig - thz]b , the threshold behavior of @xmath178 turns out to be the same as in the dc case ( fig .",
    "[ fig - fth ] ) .",
    "this seems reasonable if the doublon production is determined by the largest field during the cycle .",
    "using time - resolved photoemission spectroscopy , one might be able to observe the heating effect demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - occ ] : in a system with strong external bias , but not strong enough to lead to a dielectric breakdown , one may suddenly excite carriers created by photo - doping , monitor the evolution of the distribution function , and compare it to the result without applied field .",
    "in conclusion , we have used dmft with the nca - based impurity solver to study the behavior of a mott insulator in strong dc electric fields @xmath0 .",
    "the electric current @xmath1 is given by a contribution @xmath8 which can be associated with the doublon - hole production due to field - induced tunneling [ eq .",
    "( [ doublon - current ] ) ] , and a contribution related to the conductance of doublons and holes which are either thermally excited or induced by the field . for an isolated system , however , these carriers accumulate energy from the field and rapidly reach an `` infinite temperature '' state with zero conductivity , as apparent from a flat occupied density of states .",
    "this explains the peculiar steady state that has been described earlier , in which the current is time - independent ( and given by @xmath8 ) although the number of carriers constantly increases . in an isolated system ,",
    "the current itself is thus a good measure for the field - induced tunneling . in contrast ,",
    "when dissipation of energy is taken into account , carriers can not reach infinite temperature .",
    "the current now _ does _ depend on the number of doublons , temperature , and the coupling to the environment , whereas the doublon - hole creation current @xmath8 still provides an intrinsic measure of the tunneling .",
    "for fields @xmath179 , @xmath8 increases with @xmath0 with a threshold behavior , eq .",
    "( [ fth ] ) . for larger fields",
    ", we find that the @xmath1-@xmath0 characteristics reveals peaks at integer values of @xmath78 , which are related to signatures of wannier - stark localization of carriers in the spectrum .",
