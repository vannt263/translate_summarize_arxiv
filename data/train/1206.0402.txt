    "spin ice materials present a very interesting class of magnetic materials @xcite .",
    "mostly these are the pyrochlores with strongly anisotropic ising - like rare earth such as dy or ho @xcite , although they exist in other structures , and one can not exclude that similar materials could also be made on the basis of transition metal elements with strong anisotropy , such as co@xmath0 or  fe@xmath0 .",
    "spin ice systems consist of a network of corner - shared metal tetrahedra with effective ferromagnetic coupling between spins  @xcite , in which in the ground state the ising spins are ordered in two - in / two - out fashion .",
    "artificial spin ice systems with different structures have also been made  @xcite .",
    "spin ice systems are _ bona fide _ examples of frustrated systems , and they attract now considerable attention , both because they are interesting in their own right and because they can model different other systems , including real water ice @xcite .",
    "a new chapter in the study of spin ice was opened by the suggestion that the natural elementary excitations in spin ice materials  objects with or tetrahedra  have a magnetic charge @xcite and display many properties similar to those of magnetic monopoles  @xcite .",
    "especially the last proposal gave rise to a flurry of activity , see e.g.  @xcite , in which , in particular , the close analogy between electric and magnetic phenomena was invoked .",
    "thus , one can apply to their description many notions developed for the description of systems of charges such as electrolytes ; this description proves to be very efficient for understanding many properties of spin ice .    until now",
    "the largest attention was paid to the magnetic properties of spin ice , both static and dynamic , largely connected with monopole excitations @xcite , and the main tool to modify their properties was magnetic field , which couples directly to spins or to the magnetic charge of monopoles .",
    "i argue below that the magnetic monopoles in spin ice have yet another characteristic which could allow for other ways to influence and study them : each magnetic monopole , i.e.the tetrahedron with or configuration , shall also have an electric dipole localized at such tetrahedron .",
    "this demonstrates once again the intrinsic interplay between magnetic and electric properties of matter .",
    "it is well known that some magnetic textures can break inversion symmetry  a necessary condition for creating electric dipoles .",
    "this lies at the heart of magnetically - driven ferroelectricity in type - ii multiferroics  @xcite .",
    "there exists , in particular , a purely electronic mechanism for creating electric dipoles .",
    "i demonstrate that a similar breaking of inversion symmetry , occurring in magnetic monopoles in spin ice , finally leads to the creation of electric dipoles on them .",
    "the usual description of magnetic materials with localized magnetic moments is based on the picture of strongly correlated electrons with the ground state being a mott insulator , see e.g.  ch .",
    "12 in @xcite . in the simplest cases , ignoring orbital effects etc .",
    ", one can describe this situation by the famous hubbard model @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the matrix element of electron hopping between neighbouring sites @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the on - cite coulomb repulsion . for",
    "one electron per site , @xmath5 , and strong interaction @xmath6 the electrons are localized , and there appears an antiferromagnetic nearest neighbour exchange interaction @xmath7 between localized magnetic moments thus formed ( which acts together with the usual classical dipole - dipole interaction ) . depending on the type of crystal lattice there may exist different types of magnetic ground state , often rather nontrivial , especially in frustrated lattices containing e.g.  magnetic triangles or tetrahedra as building blocks",
    ".    one can show  @xcite that , depending on the magnetic configuration , there can occur a spontaneous charge redistribution in such a magnetic triangle , so that e.g.  the electron density on site  1 belonging to the triangle ( 1,2,3 ) is @xmath8\\ ; \\label{eq:2}\\ ] ] ( in other spin textures there may appear spontaneous orbital currents @xcite in such triangles . ) from this expression one sees , in particular , that there should occur charge redistribution for a triangle with two spins up and one down , fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , which would finally give a dipole moment @xmath9 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] by a broad green arrow .",
    "a similar expression describes also an electric dipole which can form on a triangle due to the usual magnetostriction .",
    "one can illustrate this e.g.  on the example of fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , see e.g.  @xcite , in which we show the triangle ( 1,2,3 ) made by magnetic ions , with intermediate oxygens sitting outside the triangle and forming a certain angle @xmath10o@xmath10 . for spins , fig .",
    "[ fig:2](@xmath11 ) , all three bonds are equivalent , and all @xmath10o@xmath10 angles are the same .",
    "however , in a configuration of fig .",
    "[ fig:2](@xmath12 ) ( which , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) , would give a nonzero dipole moment due to electronic mechanism ) , two bonds become `` more ferromagnetic '' , and the oxygens would shift as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](@xmath12 ) , so as to make the @xmath10o@xmath10 angle in the `` antiferromagnetic '' bond closer to 180 degrees , and in `` ferromagnetic '' bonds closer to 90 degrees ; according to the goodenough  kanamori  anderson rules this would strengthen the corresponding antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic exchange and lead to energy gain .",
    "as one sees from fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) , such distortions shift the centre of gravity of positive ( @xmath10 ) and negative ( o ) charges and thus would produce a dipole moment similar to that of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "a similar effect would also exist in a monopole configuration of spin ice , in which on some bonds the spins are oriented `` ferromagnetic - like '' ( e.g.on bonds with spins ) , and on other bonds the spins are `` more antiferromagnetic '' ( bonds with and spins ) .    ) changes to an asymmetric one for spin configuration ( red arrows ) with different spin orientations on different bonds  ( @xmath12 ) . ]    the expression ( [ eq:3 ] ) is the main expression , which gives the `` dipole on monopole '' in spin ice .",
    "indeed , when one considers three possible configuration of a tetrahedron in spin ice , fig .",
    "[ fig:3](@xmath11 ) ( or state ) , the monopole configuration of fig .",
    "[ fig:3](@xmath13 ) ( or ) , and the basic spin ice configurations , fig .",
    "[ fig:3](@xmath12 ) , then , applying the expressions ( [ eq:2 ] ) ,  ( [ eq:3 ] ) to every triangle constituting a tetrahedron , one can easily see that there would be no net dipole moments in the cases of fig .",
    "[ fig:3](@xmath11 ) ( or ) and fig .",
    "[ fig:3](@xmath12 ) ( ) , but there will appear a finite dipole moment in the case of fig .",
    "[ fig:3](@xmath13 ) , i.e.  _ there will appear an electric dipole on each magnetic monopole in spin ice_.    ) and antimonopole ( @xmath14 ) configurations ( dipoles are absent in ( @xmath11 ) and ( @xmath12 ) states ) . note that the direction of dipoles in cases ( @xmath15 ) , ( @xmath14 ) is the same ( in the direction of the `` special '' spin @xmath16 ) . ]",
    "the easiest way to check this is to start from the case [ fig:3](@xmath11 ) , with spins .",
    "the total charge transfer e.g.  on site  1 is @xmath17 for the 4-in state all the scalar products ( @xmath18 ) are equal , i.e.the charge redistribution , and with it the net dipole moment of the tetrahedron is zero .",
    "( one can also use the condition @xmath19 , valid in this case , to prove this ; the fact that the dipole moment is zero also follows just from the symmetry . )    however when we reverse the direction of one spin , e.g.  @xmath20 , creating a monopole configuration of fig .",
    "[ fig:3](@xmath15 ) , the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) changes sign , and the resulting charge transfer from sites 2 , 3 and  4 to site  1 would be non - zero  and there will appear a dipole moment on such a tetrahedron , directed from the centre of the tetrahedron to the site with the `` special spin '' , in this case to site  1  the broad green arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](@xmath15 ) ( or in the opposite direction , depending on the specific situation  the sign of the hopping @xmath2 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) , or the details of the exchange striction ) .",
    "this conclusion , shown in figs .",
    "[ fig:3]@xmath21 , is actually the main result of this paper .    as the expressions ( [ eq:2])([eq:4 ] ) for the charge redistribution and for the dipole moment",
    "are even functions of spins  @xmath22 , the reversal of all spins will not change the results .",
    "thus the magnitude _ and the direction _ of the electric dipole is the same for both the monopole ( ) and antimonopole ( ) configurations , fig .",
    "[ fig:3](@xmath15 ) and [ fig:3](@xmath14 ) : in both cases the dipole points in the direction of the `` special '' spin .",
    "similar considerations show that when we change the direction of one more spin , e.g.  @xmath23 , creating the configuration of fig .",
    "[ fig:3](@xmath12 ) , various terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) again cancel , and such spin configurations do not produce electric dipole .",
    "thus , electric dipoles appear in spin ice only on monopoles and antimonopoles .",
    "the appearance of electric dipoles on monopoles in spin ice could have many consequences , some of which we now discuss .",
    "the main effect would be the coupling of such dipoles to the dc or ac electric field , @xmath24 this would give an electric activity to monopoles , would allow one to influence them by external electric field , and would thus open a new way to study and control such monopoles in spin ice . due to this",
    "coupling the monopoles would contribute to the dielectric function @xmath25 .",
    "actually such effect was observed in @xcite , where it was found that the dielectric function has strong anomalies in dy@xmath26ti@xmath26o@xmath27 in the magnetic field in the [ 111 ] direction when the system approaches a transition to the saturated state at @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of these anomalies was not discussed in @xcite , but one can connect it with the proliferation of monopoles and antimonopoles , with the corresponding electric dipoles on each of them , in approaching this transition .    the saturated state in this situation , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , has the form of staggered monopoles  antimonopoles at every tetrahedron . from our results presented above ,",
    "we conclude that in this state there would also be electric dipoles at every tetrahedron , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] by thick green arrows .",
    "we see thus that this saturated state in a strong enough [ 111 ] magnetic field would simultaneously be antiferroelectric .",
    "thus one can also associate the anomalies observed in @xcite in @xmath25 in approaching this state as the anomalies at the antiferroelectric transition .     magnetic field .",
    "* this structure can be seen as an ordered array of monopoles and antimonopoles ; simultaneously it is antiferroelectric ( electric dipoles are shown by broad green arrows ) . ]",
    "yet another consequence of the appearance of dipoles on monopoles could be the possibility of changing the activation energy for creating such monopoles by electric field : the excitation energy of a monopole , or the monopole ",
    "antimonopole pair would be @xmath29 correspondingly , depending on the relative orientation of @xmath30 and @xmath31 , the excitation energy can both increase and decrease , but one can always find configurations of monopoles for which the energy would decrease .",
    "one should then be able to see this change of activation energy in thermodynamic and magnetic properties , such as specific heat , etc .",
    "the orientation of electric dipoles depends on the particular situation .",
    "one can easily see that in the absence of magnetic fields , for completely `` free '' , random spin ice , in general the orientation of dipoles on monopole excitations is random , in all [ 111 ] directions .",
    "but , for example , in strong enough [ 001 ] magnetic field , in which the spin ice state is ordered , fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] , the monopoles and antimonopoles would have the @xmath32-components of dipoles respectively positive and negative , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , while the perpendicular projections of @xmath30 would be random .",
    "similarly , in the [ 110 ] field @xcite the @xmath35-projection of dipole moments will be parallel to the field , @xmath36 $ ] .     magnetic field . *",
    "the @xmath32-component of electric dipoles ( broad green arrows ) on monopoles is pointing up , and on antimonopoles down .",
    "the perpendicular components of @xmath30 point in random [ 110 ] and [ @xmath37 directions .",
    "blue arrows show spins inverted in creating and moving apart monopole and antimonopole . ]",
    "yet another effect could appear in an inhomogeneous electric field , created for example close to a tip with electric voltage applied to it , in an experimental set - up shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] ( cf .",
    "e.g.  the study of nel domain walls in a ferromagnet , which also develop electric polarization and which can be influenced by inhomogeneous electric field @xcite ) . as always",
    ", the electric dipoles would move in @xmath38 , with positive dipoles e.g.  being attracted to the region of stronger field and negative ones repelled from it .",
    "one can use this effect to `` separate '' monopoles from antimonopoles .",
    "thus , as is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , in a [ 111 ] magnetic field , e.g.  in the phase of `` kagome ice '' @xcite , the `` favourable '' monopoles would have dipole moments up , and antimonopoles down , so that the monopoles would be attracted to the tip , to the region of stronger electric field , and antimonopoles would be repelled from the tip .",
    "similarly , the monopole  antimonopole separation could be reached in a [ 001 ] magnetic field , in which , as we have argued above , fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] , monopoles have @xmath39 , and antimonopoles have  @xmath40 .     or [ 001 ] magnetic field in the inhomogeneous electric field ( dashed lines ) created by a tip ( brown ) with electric voltage . ]",
    "the magnitude of the dipoles created on monopoles , and the corresponding strengths of their interaction with electric field , depend on the detailed mechanism of their creation and on the specific properties of a given material .",
    "one should think that in real spin ice materials , in which the hopping of @xmath41-electrons is rather small , it is the magnetostriction mechanism of the dipole formation on monopoles and antimonopoles that would be the dominant  one . in this case",
    "one could make a crude estimate based on the interaction  ( [ eq:5 ] ) .",
    "if the shifts of ions @xmath42 due to striction would be e.g.  of order @xmath43 , then the change of the energy @xmath44 in a field @xmath45 would be @xmath46  which would lead to measurable effects , as the typical excitation energy of monopoles in spin ice is @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "we would get effects of the same order of magnitude for the distortions @xmath48in a field  @xmath49 .",
    "summarizing , we demonstrated that there should appear real electric dipoles on magnetic monopoles in spin ice .",
    "creation of such dipoles may lead to many experimental consequences , some of which were discussed above .",
    "they can open new ways to study and to manipulate these exciting new objects  magnetic monopoles in a solid .",
    "we also see that the close connection between electric and magnetic phenomena , which lies at the hart of modern physics , extends in this case even further than one thought : in these systems one can have not only magnetic charges instead of electric ones , and `` magnetricity '' instead of electricity , but , similar to electrons which have _ electric charge _ and _ magnetic dipole _ ( spin ) , magnetic monopoles in spin ice will have _ magnetic charge _ and _ electric dipole_.    99    bramwell , s.  t. and gingras , m.  j.  p.  spin ice state in frustrated pyrochlore materials .",
