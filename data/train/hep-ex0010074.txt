    "today s picture of the most elementary particles is composed of six quark types , six lepton types , and four force carriers .",
    "the quarks and leptons come in three generations , each generation with a pair of quarks ( one with charge + 2/3 , and one with charge - 1/3 ) and a pair of leptons ( one charged , and one neutral ) . see table [ particles ] .",
    "the quarks and leptons have spin 1/2 , and couple variously to the spin 1 force carriers : gluons , photons , and charged and neutral weak bosons ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 ) . unlike the leptons , the quarks appear to come in three varieties , called colors .",
    "perhaps the number of colors is related to the quarks third - integer charges .",
    "also , quarks never appear in isolation , being permanently confined , for example , in meson and baryon combinations ( quark - antiquark and three - quark combinations , respectively ) .",
    ".today s elementary particles , by type vs generation . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ t - mass ]      given that the top quark mass is above the @xmath3 threshold , the decay width should be about 1 gev , corresponding to a lifetime of about @xmath4 seconds .",
    "thus , the @xmath5 decays before top - hadrons or onia form .",
    "this is why the decay is totally dominated by the @xmath6 @xmath7 decay mode .",
    "the production cross section is calculated in nlo perturbative qcd .",
    "the perturbative calculation is expected to be very reliable .",
    "it does depend on the mass of the top quark , of course .",
    "any inconsistency of the production rate and measured mass would cast doubt on the discovery .",
    "no discrepancy is observed , as seen in table [ t - sigma ] .",
    "on the other hand , discrepancies might indicate exotic production channels , as could an unexpected distribution of the measured @xmath8 mass distribution and the distribution of the transverse momentum of the @xmath5 .",
    "angular distributions are sensitive to the presumed v - a coupling and the relative coupling of transverse and longitudinal @xmath6 s to @xmath5 .",
    "the fraction of decays to transversely and longitudinally polarized @xmath6 s for 175 gev/@xmath9 @xmath5 is 30 % . a discrepancy would challenge the higgs mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "finally , one can also imagine seeing clues to new physics via rare or forbidden decay rates",
    ". finally , the top could be the source of observation of non - standard model particles .",
    "for example , if the higgs particle were light enough , the top quark could decay emitting a higgs particle .",
    "one could also be sensitive to decays to light enough susy particles .",
    "in the search for heavier objects , heavy quarks will play a critical role as tags for the discovery of those heavier objects , and as a key to identifying what they are .",
    "we have seen how this was the case in the top discovery , where heavy quarks in jets separated top events from others among the highest @xmath10 interactions .",
    "the higgs mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking manifests itself in a particle whose coupling to another particle is proportional to the other particle s mass .",
    "thus , standard model predictions of the higgs mass can be made via virtual loop corrections for mass of the top quark .",
    "note that the dependence of the @xmath6 mass on the top mass is linear , while the dependence is logarithmic on the higgs mass .",
    "today , there is a lot of focus on this prediction , as the competition between fermilab and cern to discover the higgs is very intense .",
    "the higgs branching ratio to other particles depends , also , on the higgs mass  due to threshold and phase space effects .",
    "so , identifying a signal at a given mass as a higgs particle depends on measuring the relative branching ratios to as many of the heavy quarks , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 states as are kinematically allowed .",
    "the asterisks in decays to @xmath12 and @xmath14 refer to virtual , intermediate decay particles , @xmath15 and @xmath16 whose decay can be to kinematically allowed final states .",
    "many physicists expect that direct observation of a higgs particle will be the next breakthrough discovery . on the other hand",
    ", surprises can happen .",
    "are the three generations of quark pairs truly the complete story ?",
    "the limits on additional light neutrinos from @xmath17 decay do not necessarily prove this , since there could be a very heavy neutrino for a fourth generation .",
    "there are some limits on this from virtual effects in rare decays of heavy quarks .",
    "there is not enough time in these lectures to give an overview of susy .",
    "the topic has been well covered in the lectures of cupatitzio ramrez and carlos wagner .",
    "let me only note that the host of predicted susy particles will place a premium on the detailed characterization of any candidate observations , as well as filling out the mass - spectrum of particles discovered .",
    "thus , the heavy squark decays to the corresponding quark , as well as susy higgs couplings are critical to the understanding of what will have been seen .",
    "i would like to recommend some reading for more detail than i could give here , in particular : a review article by harry lipkin  @xcite for the state of thinking before the november revolution of 1974 , ed thorndike s summary of bottom quark physics  @xcite , and the pdg summary by michelangelo mangano and thomas trippe  @xcite on top quarks .",
    "we have seen that heavy quarks have been both interesting in their own right , and useful tools for understanding other things  from light - meson resonances to the high - mass extensions of the current standard model .",
    "i want to note again the importance played by applying new technology matched to physics opportunities .",
    "the precision tracking made possible by microelectronic advances would have been less interesting except for the few mm lifetimes of the charm and bottom quarks in the laboratory .",
    "the fantastic increase in computing and storage efficiency made possible the treatment of large amounts of data as required by the low cross sections for heavy quark production .",
    "finally , we should also be a little humble amid all the excitement of the anticipated discoveries of the next heavy objects . in my brief review ,",
    "we have seen many of the results fly in the face of `` common knowledge '' and general expectations .",
    "let me close by reiterating the wealth of rather recent progress in understanding the quark nature of matter , and the enjoyment that has come from being part of this , both from the physics and from technical efforts .",
    "i also want to thank our hosts and organizers for a most stimulating and enjoyable workshop .",
