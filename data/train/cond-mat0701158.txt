    "conventional dc hall effect measurements have been essential in revealing the unusual character of novel electronic materials including high temperature superconducting cuprates ( htsc),@xcite diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms),@xcite and ruthenate perovskite ( rp)@xcite materials . in many of these materials , the hall angle  and transverse ( hall ) conductivity  provide information critical to understanding their electronic properties .",
    "the frequency dependence of  and  is very sensitive to the electronic structure , and in many cases exposes new insights that are hidden from the longitudinal conductivity  that is measured by conventional spectroscopy .",
    "the mid - infrared ( mir : 11 - 1.6  @xmath0 m ; 100 - 800  mev ) energy range is particularly interesting in many of these materials .",

    "although ,  and  are useful , they depend on the optical geometry of the sample , such as the thickness of the film and index of refraction of the substrate .",
    "furthermore , calculations of  and  depend on which assumptions are made for the optical formulas , e.g. , thin film , thick film , and bulk .",
    "theoretical models typically calculate response functions such as  and . since these conductivities are related to the electronic behavior in a more fundamental way , it is useful to convert  and into these more elementary quantities .    in principle",
    "one can determine  using conventional , polarization - insensitive spectroscopy techniques such as kramers - kronig analysis of reflectance measurements or analysis of transmittance and reflectance measurements .",
    "these measurements , however , do not access , which is critical to understanding many novel materials .",
    "although conventional spectroscopic techniques may be experimentally simpler than the faraday / kerr measurements presented in this paper , polarization insensitive approaches to measuring  rely on absolute transmittance and reflectance measurements , which can limit the accuracy of these techniques . on the other hand , since  and",
    "measurements are absolute measurements that do not require normalization to a reference sample , the accuracy of this technique can be very high .",
    "_ in this paper , we obtain the entire complex magneto - conductivity tensor by measuring the geometry ( orientation axis and ellipticity of the polarization ) of reflected and transmitted light ; no absolute intensity measurements are required .",
    "a key advantage of determining both  and  from the same set of  and measurements is that the behavior of , which may already be fairly well known , can provide a consistency test for , which typically is not well known in the mir . for experimental systems such as ours that are designed for magneto - polarimetry measurements , obtaining  through  and  measurements is experimentally more straightforward and more accurate than using conventional polarization insensitive spectroscopic techniques .    of course , this approach has limitations .",
    "first , one must sensitively measure polarization changes produced in transmitted and reflected light by a magnetic field .",
    "second , the samples must produce measurable  and  signals , which is not always the case . for example",
    ", in ordinary metals such as au as well as unconventional metals such as high temperature superconductors  is very small and would be difficult to measure accurately . fortunately , magnetic metals such as  and  produce  signals that can be measured readily .    in this paper , we present a mir polarimetry technique that determines the entire complex conductivity tensor using   and  measurements .",
    "we shall first introduce a sensitive magneto - optical measurement system , next we develop formulas for  and  in terms of and , and finally we shall test these techniques on  and  films .",
    "when illuminating a material in a magnetic field using linearly polarized light , the transmitted and reflected beams can be modified in two ways : the plane of polarization can be rotated with respect to the incident linear polarization and the beam may acquire ellipticity .",
    "the polarization change of the transmitted light is characterized by the complex faraday angle @xmath4 , the optical analog of the hall angle @xmath5 , where  is the longitudinal conductivity and  is the transverse ( hall ) conductivity .",
    "@xmath4 relates the magnitudes and phases of the transmitted electric fields that are perpendicular ( @xmath6 ) and parallel ( @xmath7 ) to the incident linear electric polarization , which is along the @xmath8-direction in this case : @xmath9 where @xmath7 and @xmath6 are the diagonal and off - diagonal components of the complex magneto - transmission tensor .",
    "the complex polar kerr angle @xmath10 describes the change in the polarization of reflected light for near - normal incidence , with @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the diagonal and off - diagonal components of the complex magneto - reflection tensor . for small changes in the incident polarization , @xmath14 ( @xmath15 )",
    "is related to the rotation and @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) is related to the ellipticity of the transmitted ( reflected ) beam s polarization .    the experimental technique used in this paper",
    "is based on ref .  .",
    "there are four new experimental aspects that are added here : 1 ) precision translational mount for a magneto - optical cryostat ; 2 ) extended wavelength range using additional lasers ; 3 ) reflection measurements to determine ; and 4 ) new calibration technique . after reviewing the basic experimental technique , this paper will focus on these four new areas .",
    "the experimental setup is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig;opticalpath ] .",
    "the faraday and kerr angles are measured using discrete lines from co@xmath18 ( 115 - 133 mev ) , co ( 215 - 232mev ) , and hene ( 366 mev ) lasers .",
    "measurements have also been made using laser diodes operating at 500  mev and 775  mev located near lens 3 in fig .",
    "[ fig;opticalpath ] .",
    "one can probe the samples down to 6  k and magnetic fields up to 7 t in the magneto - optical cryostat .",
    "the different laser beams are aligned in one optical path before entering the cryostat ( fig .",
    "[ fig;opticalpath ] ) .",
    "the original optical path is designed for the co@xmath18 laser .",
    "the co laser is sent to probe the sample by inserting mirror @xmath19 , which is mounted on a kinematic base before lens 1 .",
    "the hene laser is sent to probe the sample by inserting mirror @xmath20 , which is mounted on a kinematic base near the brewster reflector .",
    "an optical chopper modulates the laser intensity with a frequency @xmath21 . to prevent etalon artifacts from multiple reflections within optical components , the cryostat windows and the sample substrate",
    "are wedged 1 - 2@xmath22 , and the photoelastic modulator ( pem ) , which is used to analyze the polarization of the tranmsitted / reflected radiation , is tilted forward 25@xmath22 . as is discussed in more detail in section  [ sign_sect ] , a compressively strained znse slide produces a well - characterized rotation and ellipticity ( see boxed inset in fig .",
    "[ fig;opticalpath ] ) in the polarization , which can be used to determine the absolute signs of  and .",
    "the 7  t magneto - optical cryostat has only two windows , with the sample in vacuum .",
    "these room temperature znse windows are placed on 30  cm extension tubes ( as can be seen fig .",
    "[ fig;mount ] ) to minimize their contribution to the faraday rotation due to the stray magnetic field .",
    "the absence of cold windows is important in several respects .",
    "first , other magneto - optical cryostat can have up to four cold windows ( a pair of liquid helium temperature and a pair of liquid nitrogen temperature windows ) that are located close to the sample and therefore experience similar magnetic fields as the sample .",
    "since the cold windows typically are several millimeters thick , they can produce a large magneto - polarization signal that can readily overwhelm the signal produced by the sample , typically several hundred nanometer - thick films .",
    "furthermore , the absence of cold windows increases transmission and reduces artifacts due to multiple reflection .",
    "a photoelastic modulator ( pem ) makes it possible to measure sensitively both real and imaginary parts of  and .@xcite the optical axis of the pem is oriented vertically along the @xmath8 axis and modulates the phase of the transmitted light that is polarized along the @xmath23-direction at a frequency @xmath24  khz .",
    "a linear polarizer @xmath25 is oriented 45@xmath22 from vertical and mixes the @xmath8 and @xmath23 polarization components of the light that has passed through the pem . a liquid - nitrogen - cooled mercury - cadmium - telluride ( mct )",
    "detector measures the intensity of the modulated beam .",
    "if the sample does not cause any changes in the incident polarization , the light entering the pem is linearly polarized along the @xmath8-direction and there will be no signals at the detector related to the pem .",
    "three lock - in amplifiers demodulate the detector signal .",
    "one lock - in amplifier is referenced to chopper frequency @xmath26 to provide a measurement of the average laser intensity @xmath27 at the detector .",
    "the other two lock - in amplifiers are referenced to harmonics of @xmath28 to detect the polarization of the beam .",
    "the even harmonics of @xmath28 are related to a rotation of the polarization vector [ re ( ) or re ( ) ] and the odd harmonics are related to the ellipticity [ i m ( ) or im()].@xcite typically , one measures the rotation using the second harmonic signal @xmath29 and the ellipticity using the third harmonic signal @xmath30 .",
    "the mount holding the 7  t magneto - optical cryostat can be translated with high accuracy ( @xmath31 m ) both horizontally and vertically . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig;mount ] , the cryostat rests on a large 5/16 `` thick aluminum base plate ( 17 '' by 24 `` ) that has two long turcite ( grade a , blue ) strips attached to the bottom of the base plate directly below the vertical supports .",
    "the strips are 0.030 '' thick , 23 `` long , and 2 '' wide , and are epoxied into shallow pockets in the bottom of the plate .",
    "turcite is optimized for high load , low friction applications and does not cold flow .",
    "the base plate and cryostat are moved horizontally with respect to the optical table by turning a 3/8``x24 brass lead screw that is attached to the base plate and the optical table .",
    "the height of the cryostat is adjusted by simultaneously turning four 3/4''x16 brass lead screws that are threaded into turcite bushings in each of the four cryostat mount support legs . to insure that the cryostat is raised and lowered uniformly , without tipping ,",
    "the brass lead screws are coupled to each other by a 1 `` wide , 80 '' long timing belt ( t10 , 10  mm pitch ) that connects 5 \" diameter timing pulleys that are attached to each lead screw .",
    "the design and construction of this mount is challenging since it must be made of non - magnetic materials and since the cryostat weighs approximately 700 pounds .",
    "separate leveling feet at the bottom of each brass lead screw allow the cryostat to be leveled .",
    "the magneto - optical signals are critically affected when the probe laser beam is close to the edge of the aperture in the copper plate on which the sample is held , so centering the sample , which can be as small as 3  mm , on the laser beam is very important . since the lasers are invisible , this can be difficult .",
    "the procedure for centering the sample on the laser beam is greatly improved and simplified using the translating cryostat mount .",
    "the transmitted or reflected signal at the detector is simply maximized by translating the sample ( along with the cryostat ) vertically and horizontally .",
    "precision indicators ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig;mount ] ) are placed to measure the absolute position of the magneto - optical cryostat . by monitoring the detector signal as one translates the cryostat and sample aperture across the beam",
    ", one can determine the laser beam profile and accurately center the sample on the beam .",
    "since they contain magnetic components , the indicators are removed before the running measurements with the superconducting magnet energized . as with the magneto - optical cryostat described in ref .  , unwanted motion of the sample is minimized by clamping the lower end of the sample tube to a horizontal delrin rod , which is attached to an aluminum plate in the side window opening of the tailpiece .",
    "furthermore , the tailpiece of the cryostat itself is clamped to the base plate by four bolts that are capped with turcite pads , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig;mount ] .",
    "this greatly increases the rigidity of the cryostat mount and minimizes sample movement when the magnetic field is energized .    unlike ref .  , which describes measurements in the 112 - 136  mev ( 1100 - 900  @xmath32",
    "; 11 - 9  @xmath0 m ) range , in this paper the measurements have been extended up to 775  mev ( 6250  @xmath32 , 1.6  @xmath0 m ) . since the pem ,",
    "the lenses , and the cryostat windows are znse , the optical system is compatible with sources over the 0.5 - 20  @xmath0 m range .",
    "the main challenge in using sources with shorter wavelength @xmath33 is that the background faraday rotation due to stray magnetic fields at the windows and sample substrate increases as @xmath34.@xcite this makes careful measurement and subtraction of the background at shorter wavelengths especially critical .",
    "since this background is reduced when the energy gap of the optical material is increased relative to the photon energy , higher band gap optical materials such as baf@xmath35 and caf@xmath35 will be used for the cryostat windows in future measurements .",
    "a further advantage of baf@xmath35 and caf@xmath35 is their smaller index ( 1.5 compared to 2.4 for znse ) that reduces fresnel losses in transmitting light through them .",
    "initially , the 3.4  @xmath0 m hene laser was placed approximately 1.5  m away from the magnet .",
    "however the stray magnetic field at that distance induces both rotation and ellipticity in the output of the hene laser that is comparable to the signals produced by many of our samples (  @xmath36  rad at 1  t).@xcite this background is dramatically reduced by moving the hene laser farther away (  2.5  m ) from the magneto - optical cryostat .    in this paper both transmission and reflection measurements are made to determine both  and , whereas only transmission measurements ( ) were reported in ref .  .",
    "although  and provide similar information , there are several advantages to measuring both",
    ". first , in the metallic films that are reported here , the transmittance can be very low as is discussed in the section  [ samples ] of this paper .",
    "the reflectance amplitudes , on the other hand , are typically on the order of 50  % or higher .",
    "although the substrates used in our measurements are relatively transparent in the mir ,  measurements are not limited to transparent substrates and can even be applied to bulk materials where transmission measurements would be impossible for metals .",
    "the fact that  and  are related is also an advantage in that the self - consistency of the results may be confirmed .    in ref .",
    "we describe several techniques to calibrate the polarimetry system .",
    "we have developed a new technique which allows the simultaneous calibration of the pem retardance @xmath37 and the angle @xmath38 of the final linear polarizer @xmath25 .",
    "one of the calibration techniques in ref .",
    "is to rotate the pem by a known small angle @xmath39 and use the change in the normalized detector signal @xmath40 that is at @xmath41 to calibrate .",
    "the pem and polarizer @xmath25 are rotated as a single unit , so that the angle @xmath38 between the pem and @xmath25 is kept constant . in this case , we measure the normalized signals @xmath40 and @xmath42 at @xmath41 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "for @xmath44 these signals depend on @xmath39 as follows :    @xmath45    where @xmath46 are @xmath47th order bessel functions , @xmath27 is the signal at the chopper frequency , @xmath48 is the signal at @xmath41 , and @xmath49 is the signal at @xmath43 .",
    "note that the ratio of @xmath40 and @xmath42 in eq .",
    "[ eq;sratio ] only depends on @xmath37 , as all the other factors cancel .",
    "one can use the measurement of @xmath50 to determine @xmath37 . since neither @xmath39 nor @xmath38 enter into eq .",
    "[ eq;sratio ] , this calibration is not affected by the amount the pem is rotated , as long @xmath51 , nor by the precise orientation of polarizer @xmath25 . once @xmath37 is determined , it can be entered into either eqs .",
    "[ eq;s2 ] or [ eq;s4 ] to determine @xmath38 , which is nominally 45@xmath22 .",
    "although @xmath38 can be calibrated , when doing measurements at a various wavelengths , errors can be reduced by keeping @xmath38 constant .",
    "the errors in adjusting @xmath25 to make @xmath52 at each wavelength can be significant .",
    "if @xmath38 is kept constant , there will be no variation from wavelength to wavelength due to different settings of @xmath25 .",
    "a further check when performing this calibration at different wavelengths and different lasers , is that @xmath38 from the fits should be the same since @xmath25 was not moved with respect to the pem . in our calibration measurements , @xmath38",
    "determined from this calibration typically remains constant to within @xmath53 over the entire measurement range . as in ref .",
    ", the roll - off attenuation of the detector and its associated electronics is included in the final calibration .",
    "we have found that the roll - off also depends on the gain setting of the detector pre - amplifier .",
    "the  sample consists of a 282  nm thick  film on a substrate and was grown by pulsed laser deposition at oak ridge national laboratory as described in ref .  .",
    "the  substrate is transparent in the mir , which allowed * both * transmission and reflection measurements to be made .",
    "the thickness of the  film and the fact that the substrate begins to absorb strongly below 117 mev , resulted in transmittances that could be below 0.01  % .",
    "fortunately , high power coherent sources such as the co@xmath35 and co lasers coupled with a liquid nitrogen cooled detector provide the measurement system with the necessary dynamic range to measure small changes in the polarization even for such small transmittance values .",
    "the back of the  substrate was polished to a 2@xmath22 wedge after the film was grown .",
    "the  sample having a curie temperature of 95  k was synthesized using mn@xmath54 ion implantation followed by pulsed - laser melting ( ii - plm).@xcite a semi - insulating gaas ( 001 ) wafer was implanted with 80  kev mn@xmath54 to a dose of @xmath55  @xmath56 and irradiated in air with a single 0.4  j/@xmath57 pulse from a krf excimer laser .",
    "the total mn concentration depth profile measured by secondary ion mass spectrometery ( sims ) was nearly gaussian with a peak value of approximately 8  % and a width of 50  nm .",
    "the back of the gaas substrate was polished to a 1@xmath22 wedge after the film was grown .",
    "although many experimental improvements have been made since our first report in ref .  , the primary contribution of this paper involves a novel analysis of  and  measurements . in this section",
    "we develop thick - film formulas for  and  in terms of  and .",
    "we also discuss the sign conventions that are used for  and .      since  and  are defined in terms of the complex transmission and reflection amplitudes @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 , we begin by determining these amplitudes . as light passes through a thick film sample on a wedged substrate , part of the beam is reflected and part is transmitted at each interface , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig;film ] .",
    "the beam that reflects off the first air - film interface combines with beams that have been multiply reflected within the film to produce the reflected light .",
    "since the back of the substrate is wedged , beams that reflect from it do not combine with the beams reflecting off the film .",
    "the first pass beam combines with beams that are multiply reflected within the film to produce the transmitted light entering the substrate .",
    "this transmitted light is also multiply reflected within the substrate , but since the substrate is wedged , each order of reflection exits the substrate at a different angle .",
    "therefore , the main advantage of using a wedged substrate is that one can spatially separate the first - pass beam from beams that are multiply reflected within the substrate .",
    "consider a thick film with complex index of refraction @xmath62 on a wedged substrate with complex index of refraction @xmath63 .",
    "the fresnel coefficients @xmath64 and @xmath65 describe the transmission and reflection amplitudes , respectively , at each interface separating a material with index @xmath66 from a material with index @xmath67 .",
    "summing over all transmitted beams including only multiple reflections within the film , the complex transmission coefficient for the sample is given by :    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the wave number of the light within the film and @xmath70 is the thickness of the film .",
    "the index 0 represents air .",
    "the phase shift of beam that passes through the film is given by @xmath71 .",
    "for the wedged substrate , we are only interested in the first pass beam , which experiences a phase shift of @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the thickness of wedged substrate .    similarly adding all contributions to the reflected light , the total reflection coefficient becomes :    @xmath74    note that the @xmath75 on a wedged substrate is the same as for a film on an infinitely thick substrate since the reflection from the back of the substrate never reaches the detector .",
    "the following calculation connects the  to the optical conductivities  and . we shall assign the @xmath76-axis as the direction of light propagation and also the direction of the magnetic field @xmath77",
    "assuming that the sample is cylindrically symmetric along @xmath76-axis , the conductivity tensor would be indistinguishable between @xmath8- and @xmath23-axis , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , the optical conductivity tensor is purely diagonal in the circular polarization basis .",
    "one can write the complex dielectric function @xmath80 for a circularly polarized basis with either positive or negative helicity .",

    "the sign of the polarization rotation ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) is determined by rotating the pem and linear polarizer @xmath25 together in a counter - clockwise direction as viewed along the beam s propagation direction towards the detector .",
    "this is equivalent to the sample rotating the transmitted / reflected polarization in the clockwise direction .",
    "the change in signal is compared with that produced by the sample in a magnetic field .",
    "second , the sign of both the rotation and ellipticity can be verified by placing a znse slide in the beam as described in refs .  .",
    "the index of refraction in znse is decreased for the linear polarization along the compressive strain direction,@xcite and hence this polarization exits the znse slide before the polarization that is perpendicular to the compressively strained axis . for the geometry shown in the boxed inset of fig .",
    "[ fig;opticalpath ] , this phase shift between perpendicular linear polarizations produces a counterclockwise rotation of the linear polarization as well as a counterclockwise ellipticity , as viewed towards the detector .",
    "the strain on the znse slide is applied by hanging a weight on a compression lever , as can be seen in greater detail in ref .  .",
    "since the orientation of the slide critically affects the tranmsitted polarization , the slide holder is clamped to the optical table to prevent small movements of the slide when the weight is added or removed .",
    "the same calibration can be made using a waveplate , as described in ref .  , but a znse slide is much less expensive than a zeroth order infrared waveplate , and since the strain is applied externally , there is no ambiguity for the direction of the fast axis , which is not always clear on a waveplate . the compressed slide sign calibration technique can be used over a large wavelength range ( 500  nm to 20  @xmath0 m ) without any sign changes for two reasons : 1 ) the strain , and therefore the retardance , of the slide is small , so even at the shortest wavelengths in this range the retardance never apporoaches @xmath137 , where fast and slow axes would reverse .",
    "2 ) the piezobirefringence coefficient for znse does not change sign in this wavelength range.@xcite these sign calibrations are performed with the sample in place and under exactly the same conditions that are used for measuring the sample .",
    "once the calibrations are completed , the pem is aligned with the laser polarization and the znse slide is removed before the magnetic field is energized .",
    "once the directions of the rotation and ellipticity signals are determined with respect to the magnetic field direction and the direction of light propagation , one can use ref .   to determine the proper signs of  and .",
    "finally , the signs of polarization signals are verified by measuring @xmath14 and @xmath16 produced by a gold film at 120  mev . since  in gold is produced by free electrons , one can characterize the response of a sample in @xmath14 and @xmath16 as  electron - like \" or  hole - like . \"",
    "one can represent the complex  and  of gold using a simple drude model , which in turn can be used to calculate  using the thick - film transmission formula in eq .",
    "( [ eq;tanf ] ) . this same formula is then used to calculate  backwards \" from the measured  and  produced by other samples to obtain  and .",
    "the signs of @xmath14 and @xmath16 determined by this calculation can be used to determine the signs produced by other samples . for example , applying eq .",
    "( [ eq;tanf ] ) to a drude model for a gold film produces @xmath138 and @xmath139 below 200  mev .",
    "therefore , if the @xmath14 signal for a sample has the same polarity with applied magnetic field as the signal from a gold film ( electron - like ) , a negative value of @xmath14 is used in the thick - film equation to determine  and .",
    "the sign of @xmath16 is determined the same way .",
    "this convention insures that a film with an electron - like response in both @xmath14 and @xmath16 will produce the correct signs and magnitudes of  and .",
    "since  from a gold film is too small to measure , we can not us the gold film to calibrate the sign of .",
    "the signs obtained using these three techniques are all consistent with each other .",
    "for example , rotating the pem counter - clockwise produced a signal with the opposite polarity as applying strain to the znse slide .",
    "furthermore , the signs ( determined by rotating the pem or straining a znse slide ) of the transmitted polarization signals produced by a gold film were consistent with the lower frequency ( @xmath140  mev ) behavior of electrons in a magnetic field .",
    "when the calibrated signs for the measured  and  are used in our thick film equations , we obtain reasonable optical properties .",
    "first , the real @xmath47 and imaginary @xmath141 parts of the index of refraction are positive .",
    "second , for probe frequencies below the plasma frequency of metallic samples such as au and , the real part of the dielectric function @xmath142 is negative , implying that @xmath143 .",
    "the final signs for  and  are not arbitrarily assigned , but are determined from the measurements and the calibration procedure described here .",
    "the measurements on the  and  films reported here probe the anomalous hall effect , which is the hall effect that arises from the sample magnetization .",
    "therefore , to eliminate contributions from the ordinary hall effect , which depends on the applied magnetic field , these measurements were performed on films that are fully magnetized out of plane with zero applied magnetic field . in the case of",
    "where the remanent magnetization was very small , the finite - field linear behavior is extrapolated back to @xmath144.@xcite the measurement and analysis techniques described in this paper can be applied to finite magnetic fields equally well .",

    "below 300  mev , both @xmath14 and @xmath16 are negative , indicating that the change in polarization is in the same sense as the faraday signals from free electrons in a gold reference film . strictly speaking ,  and  are not defined at zero energy , but they approach well - defined values as @xmath147 .",

    "although the intensity of transmitted light can be as small as 0.01  % , the magneto - optical signals in transmission ( ) are approximately an order of magnitude larger than those obtained in reflection ( ) .",
