    "the millisecond pulsar ( msp ) is formed in the binary accretion phase , while the neutron star ( ns ) accretes matter from its companion .",
    "the magnetic field and spin period are both decreased to the values of @xmath0gauss and several milliseconds ( wijnands & van der klis 1998 ) , if the system absorbed the mass of about 0.2 solar mass ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "then the conventional ns is formed from the supernova explosion , while a high magnetic field of about @xmath3 g and spin period of about 20 - 30 milliseconds , which can be seen from the observed pulsar data of atnf ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* manchester et al .  2005 ) ) . in a ns binary system ,",
    "if the accretion mass of @xmath4 is accreted from the companion , a ns can be spun up to several tens of milliseconds , while its magnetic field will be decayed to @xmath5 g , e.g. the double pulsar system ( lyne et al .",
    "2004 ; van den heuvel 2004 ) .",
    "therefore , more mass accreted and less magnetic field of ns achieved ( ( * ? ? ? * zhang & kojima 2006 ) ) . in this short paper",
    "we present some enquiries and basic conclusions on msp evolution .",
    "during the accretion phase , if the ns field is high , then the accreting mhd materials flow along the polar field lines to fall on the ns surface , while the mhd matter is piled - up at the magnetic polar cap and it flows from the polar cap to the equator , while the mhd flow drags the field lines asides to dilute the polar field strength ( ( * ? ? ? * zhang & kojima 2006 ) ) .",
    "the accretion flow continues until the field lines are all trapped into the star , at where the magnetosphere of ns equals to the ns radius , which can give a bottom field ( @xmath6 ) of ns of about @xmath7 g after the system accretes about 0.2 solar mass , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the accretion rate .",
    "if the accretion rate is at its minimum value of @xmath2 g / s , then the minimum field strength of msp is obtained as @xmath10 from the known derived fields of msps , we find the minimum value of field is about @xmath11 g ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* manchester et al .  2005 ) ) , which is very close to our theoretical result .",
    "moreover , the field and spin evolutions with the accreted mass can be given , and both decay until the bottom values after system accretes about 0.2 solar mass .",
    "generally , from a long - term point of views , the field decays while the accreted mass is added , and field has little decay if the accretion phase stops .",
    "the evidence for this can be found from the binary pulsar system ( ns+white dwarf ) , where the temperature of wd is observed that implies a cooling age of system , which gives a conclusion that the field has little decay at the time scale of @xmath12 yr if there is no accretion .",
    "from the accretion induced field decay model ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* zhang & kojima 2006 ) ) , if the accretion mhd dragging at the polar cap is totally frozen , then all accreted matter contributes to the field decay . in case",
    "the mhd frozen efficiency is not 100% , for instance 1% , then 0.2 solar mass accretion only makes field decay to @xmath13 g .",
    "if this efficiency is as low as 0.01% , then 0.2 solar mass accretion makes the little field decay .",
    "the frozen efficiency may be related to the magnetic inclination angle of ns , then detail of which is still in consideration .",
    "say , some nss may have little field decays after accreting 0.2 solar mass .",
    "the accretion mass has a dominant role in msp evolution ; the accretion rate is also a factor . from x - ray ns ,",
    "the average rate is about @xmath14 g / s .",
    "if the rate is less than @xmath15 g / s , then the ohmic decay velocity will be faster than the accretion deepen - in velocity , while the accretion can not bury the field into the ns core region . therefore , a minimum accretion rate is needed for the field decay .",
    "the high accretion rate corresponds to a high bottom field , e.g. eddington rate will correspond to a bottom field of @xmath0 g .",
    "two decades ago , researchers often thought that the mass of msp should be usually as high as 2.0 @xmath16 .",
    "however , the recent statistics of 65 measured ns masses indicates that the average mass of msp is only 1.6 solar mass ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* zhang et al . 2011 ) ) , comparing to the mass of slow rotating ns of about 1.4 solar mass , and msp seems to absorbs only 0.2 solar mass in average .",
    "then a question arises where it goes the one solar mass of wd companion ? does an msp only accrete 20% mass of its companion ?",
    "after the spinning - up of an msp , some accreted mass is finally rejected from the ns ?",
    "the eos of msps is different from that of normal nss ?",
    "these questions are still open .",
    "msps are usually thought to be formed by a spin - up of ns in a binary system by accretion .",
    "then , the idea that an msp forms in an accretion induced collapse of a wd is not automatically excluded . what is a specialty of an msp from aic ?",
    "the mass of an msp by aic should be less than chandrasekhar limit , e.g. 1.3 solar mass . from the measured masses of msps ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* zhang et al . 2011 ) ) , it really exist 3 msps with the masses less than 1.3 solar masses",
    ". then we can not be sure if these low mass msps are formed in the low mass states , e.g. one solar mass , or by aic processes .",
    "more msp masses are needed , by which we can distinguish the details of msp mass and its formation processes .",
    "the evolution history of msps can be understood in this way : the initial magnetic field of ns can be as high as @xmath17 g , and it can decay to @xmath18 g , after accreting @xmath19 , while ns magnetosphere is the same size of ns . in other words , the bottom field of msp",
    "is determined by the condition that the radius of ns magnetosphere equals the radius of ns .",
    "this fact means that the bottom field is nothing to do with its initial field strength ! from the field and spin period distributions of msps and pulsars ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* wang et al . 2011 ) ) , we notice that the field distribution of normal pulsars ranges at @xmath20 g , then that of msps ranges narrowly at @xmath21 g , which should be the effect of bottom field , at where the fields stops but is no relation to its born field .",
    "the significant application of bottom field is that the high and low luminosity x - ray sources , z and atoll , share the similar khz qpo frequencies , indicating the similar magnetosphere radii at scale of ns radii ( zhang 2004 ; zhang et al .",
    "if accretion drives decays of the magnetic field of an msp , is the magnetic structure altered too ?",
    "yes ; the polar field lines of msp are dragged to the equator region , where all field lines are sinked into the core region of ns ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( zhang & kojima 2006 ) ) .",
    "thus , the estimation indicates that the polar field of msp is as low as @xmath23 g , the equator field , beneath the ns surface , can be as high as @xmath24 g , and the core field of ns may be even higher that @xmath25 g , e.g. @xmath2 g .",
    "in other words , the msp magnetic structure is redistributed after accretion .",
    "the leaked - out field lines of the msp may produce the effect that the local field at the magnetic equator should be much higher than @xmath23 g , e.g. @xmath26 g , then the global field of msp is dominated by a polar field with the low value @xmath23 g .",
    "radio observations of msps should reflect their low field characteristic , while the x - ray observation may show their local strong fields .",
    "the complex magnetic structure of msp may be noticed from the high energy emissions , e.g. _ fermi _ , in the future ."
