    "quantum transport of particles on discrete graphs is governed by the interference of all possible pathways as provided by the graph structure .",
    "this wavelike interference can be harnessed as an algorithmic tool in quantum computation @xcite , for excitation transfer in spin chains @xcite and may even play a role in photosynthesis @xcite .",
    "if multiple indistinguishable particles propagate on the same graph , one has to take their exchange symmetry into account @xcite , which leads to correlations between the particles @xcite .",
    "generally speaking , increasing particle numbers causes interference among a growing number of many - particle paths and gives rise to intricate evolution scenarios @xcite , as experimentally demonstrated in planar graphs @xcite , as well as for two @xcite and three @xcite particles in two dimensions .",
    "the complexity of such evolution scenarios is simplified in the presence of symmetries in the unitary evolution matrix of the transport process .",
    "to date , only few such symmetries have been investigated in the context of many - particle interference : the discrete fourier transform @xcite , sylvester matrices @xcite and the @xmath0 lattice @xcite . in all these cases ,",
    "symmetries lead to analytic suppression laws , predicting whether or not a final particle configuration can occur .    in this work ,",
    "we consider the quantum transport of @xmath1 identical particles in hypercube graphs ( hc ) of arbitrary dimension .",
    "these highly symmetric graphs attracted much attention in the context of single particle quantum walks @xcite , owing to their promise of robust exponential speed - ups in search algorithms compared to classical random walks @xcite .",
    "in particular , we investigate how symmetries influence many - particle transport on hc graphs .",
    "we show analytically that the interference conditions are solely defined by the symmetries of the graph as well as of the initial state and derive suppression laws for bosons and fermions .",
    "these suppression laws predict final states with a vanishing probability of occurrence , due to destructive interference among the @xmath1-particle trajectories .",
    "we also show that the number of suppressed states depends strictly on how many relevant symmetries the initial state satisfies .",
    "furthermore , the suppression law persists in generalized hcs with identical but arbitrary subgraphs on all vertices .",
    "this permits each node of the hc to carry internal degrees of freedom , making our approach compatible with implementations in various systems .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in section  [ sec : preliminaries ] we start with a brief introduction to many - body interference and discuss consequences of particle indistinguishability and statistical differences between bosons and fermions .",
    "a symmetric representation of the evolution scenario on hc graphs , followed by the symmetry suppression laws and an illustrative example , is given in section  [ sec : supplawbarehc ] .",
    "the generalization to hc graphs with arbitrary but identical subgraphs on all vertices is shown in section  [ sec : gensupplawhc ] .",
    "finally , we discuss the results and provide an outlook towards possible experimental implementations in section  [ sec : discussion ] . for completeness , all derivations of the discussed suppression laws are given in the appendix .",
    "a continuous - time quantum evolution on a graph with @xmath2 identical vertices is governed by a hamiltonian @xmath3 with elements @xmath4 , specifying the transition rates between sites @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in such a system , an initial configuration of @xmath1 particles",
    "is fully described by the _ mode occupation list _ @xmath7 , where each element @xmath8 specifies the number of particles in mode @xmath6 . for convenience ,",
    "particle states can also be expressed by the _ mode assignment list _",
    "@xmath9 with @xmath10 denoting the mode number occupied by the @xmath6-th particle @xcite . a final state after projective measurement",
    "is similarly denoted by @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "after an action of the hamiltonian for some time @xmath13 , a single particle state undergoes a unitary transformation @xmath14 . for the transition of many - particle states , however , all possibilities to distribute the particles among the final modes contribute .",
    "particle indistinguishability then requires a coherent sum over all many - particle paths in the calculation of the transition probability  @xcite , @xmath15 where the sum runs over the set of all possible permutations @xmath16 of the final mode assignment list @xmath17 .",
    "due to the bosonic ( fermionic ) ( anti-)commutation - relation , one has @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "it must be emphasized , that the number of particles for fermions is restricted to @xmath20 due to pauli s principle @xcite , whereas multiple bosons are allowed to occupy the same mode . by defining the matrix @xmath21 , which contains all rows and columns of @xmath22 , corresponding to occupied initial and final modes , respectively",
    ", the transition probabilities @xmath23 and @xmath24 are obtained from the permanent ( determinant ) of transition amplitudes in a coherent manner .",
    "thus , many - particle interference arises from the indistinguishability of the particles , that is , the absence of any which - path information in the process .",
    "for comparison , the transition probability for distinguishable particles  @xcite @xmath25 contains no phase dependence and is , thus , not affected by many - body interference .    essentially , symmetries simplify the complex interplay in many - body transitions and result in a structured ordering , which individually affects the arising interferences for bosons and fermions",
    ". a closer look at the calculation of transition probabilities according to ( [ eq : pb ] ) and ( [ eq : pf ] ) reveals , that symmetries of the unitary matrix @xmath22 will transfer into @xmath26 for appropriate choices of the initial and the final state .",
    "consequently , the resulting symmetries in @xmath26 strongly affect the outcome in ( [ eq : pb ] ) and ( [ eq : pf ] )  @xcite .",
    "in particular , total destructive interference will occur for certain combinations of initial and final states , which is discussed for hc graphs in the following .",
    "the @xmath27-dimensional hypercube consists of @xmath28 modes , each connected to @xmath27 neighbours as illustrated in figure  [ fig : hc3d ] .",
    "modes ( blue balls ) are equally coupled ( silver connections ) to @xmath27 neighbouring modes.,width=377 ]    note that this system may be seen as a generalisation of a @xmath29-site graph in @xmath27 dimensions .",

    "for an evolution time @xmath31 , the unitary transformation matrix reads @xmath32 it contains all single - particle transformation amplitudes and is the basis for calculating many - particle amplitudes according to  ( [ eq : pb])-([eq : pd ] ) . due to the tensor power in ( [ eq : u ] ) ,",

    "thus , the elements of the unitary can be written as @xmath51\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as shown in  [ aqq : uelements ] .",
    "the simple phase relation in this expression is of advantage when evaluating interference contributions for the calculation of transition probabilities in  ( [ eq : p ] ) .",
    "note that the unitary  ( [ eq : u ] ) is equivalent to the one considered in  @xcite except for local phase operations .",
    "consequently , suppression laws have also been discovered in sylvester interferometers for specific initial states with particle numbers in powers of two .",
    "as we show in the following , however , by making use of the hc symmetries , one can prove suppression laws for a much larger class of particle configurations .",
    "we consider the self - inverse symmetry operations @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes the @xmath54 identity matrix and @xmath55 the @xmath54 pauli spin - x - operator .",
    "these symmetry operators are mutually commuting and act on mode occupation lists as @xmath56 transpositions of all @xmath41 segments , according to @xmath57_j= \\sum_{k=1}^n \\mathcal{s}(p)_{j , k}\\ r_k = r_{j+x(j , p)\\frac{n}{p}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which can be interpreted as a reflection in dimension @xmath58 .",
    "moreover , a consecutive action of symmetry operations with different @xmath41 values , where each operator acts at most once , is denoted by @xmath59 with @xmath60 and @xmath61 denoting the number of elements in @xmath62 .",
    "thus , the total number of possible symmetry operations for the @xmath27 dimensional hc corresponds to the number of subsets of @xmath63 , omitting the empty list .",
    "these @xmath64 self - inverse symmetries are key to the classification of the arising many - particle interferences .",
    "figure  [ fig : symopd3 ] demonstrates the case of a three dimensional hc , where all self - inverse operations are assigned to familiar symmetries . for compositions of symmetry - operators ,",
    "it is convenient to introduce walsh functions @xmath65 which assign @xmath38  @xmath66 to all modes as governed by the symmetry set @xmath62 , thereby partitioning all modes into two orthogonal subsets . for the sake of completeness , the lower rows in table  [ tab : x ] list the partitionings for any set @xmath62 on the three dimensional hc .    , @xmath67 and @xmath68 act as plane mirror symmetry operations , indicated on cube @xmath69 .",

    "for each of the involved independent symmetries , particles must be arranged in a configuration which is invariant under all independent symmetries .",
    "therefore , the particle number is restricted to @xmath79 with @xmath80 being the number of independent symmetries and @xmath81 .",
    "under these conditions , the underlying symmetry can lead to a vanishing transition probability for certain final states .",
    "this arises from the @xmath1-particle transition amplitudes of  ( [ eq : p ] ) summing up in pairs of permutations , which cancel out due to their opposite phases .",
    "the partitioning of all @xmath2 modes according to the walsh functions in  ( [ eq : partition ] ) then allows the formulation of suppression laws , that predict which final states are suppressed :    * bosons : * _ for an initial state @xmath82 of @xmath1 bosons , which is invariant under the symmetry operation @xmath83 , all final states @xmath84 with an odd number of particles in the subset of modes @xmath85 for which @xmath86 , are suppressed , i.e. , _",

    "the proofs of these suppression laws are given in [ aqq : suplawproof ] .",
    "the direct connection of the involved symmetries to the condition for total destructive interference is immediately apparent by comparing the symmetry operation  ( [ eq : symoplist ] ) with the partitioning  ( [ eq : partition ] ) .",
    "these symmetries simplify the underlying complexity of many - particle evolutions in a demonstrative way ( see section  [ sec : bosonexample ] for an explicit example ) .",
    "even if no statement about probabilities of non - vanishing events is made by the suppression laws ( [ eq : supplaw1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : supplaw2 ] ) themselves , they are obtained purely analytically , thereby permitting a prediction which final states must be suppressed with little computational overhead .    a deeper comparison of the suppression laws for bosons and fermions reveals an interesting connection : first of all , fermions feature a much more general condition for suppression as compared to bosons , such that the set of allowed configurations is more restricted for the former . whether the suppressed boson states are also forbidden for fermions depends on the parity of @xmath88 : for particle numbers satisfying @xmath90=0 $ ] the two suppression conditions coincide , that is , states with an odd number of particles occupying the relevant set of modes are suppressed for both types of particles .",
    "however , for @xmath90=2 $ ] , the conditions are complementary to each other .",
    "a similar effect was discovered in the studies of the discrete fourier transform in  @xcite , where the particle number also determines whether or not the suppression law for many - fermion states resembles the one for bosons .      in order to highlight the extent of many - body destructive interference on the considered graphs , the suppression ratios @xmath91 for the derived suppression laws  ( [ eq : supplaw1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : supplaw2 ] )",
    "are discussed in the following . here",
    "@xmath92 denotes the total number of final states and @xmath93 the predicted number of suppressed states .    according to the suppression law  ( [ eq : supplaw1 ] ) , for bosonic initial states , which are invariant under a single independent symmetry operation , one expects the suppression of about half of all possible final states .",
    "however , if an initial state is invariant under @xmath80 independent symmetry operations , the partition overlaps need to be considered . from the definition of the walsh functions in  ( [ eq : partition ] ) , one finds @xmath94 for @xmath95 ( see for example table  [ tab : x ] ) .",
    "thus , partitions corresponding to different symmetry operations , overlap to one half .",
    "it follows , that the suppression ratio for those bosonic initial states can be approximated for large @xmath2 by @xmath96    ) and ( [ eq : suppratiofermions ] ) , respectively . in the case of fermions ,",
    "the particle number is set to @xmath97 whereas for bosons the result does not depend on the number of particles.,width=359 ]    in the case of fermions , for each independent symmetry , the suppression law  ( [ eq : supplaw2 ] ) forces all particles to distribute equally among the two complementary subsets , regardless to the occupation within each individual subset .",
    "furthermore , subsets corresponding to different symmetries share one half or their elements .",
    "thus , for @xmath80 independent symmetries the total number of subsets , among which particles are forced to distribute equally , is given by @xmath98 .",
    "accordingly , the number of states , which are not covered by the suppression law  ( [ eq : supplaw2 ] ) , is given by @xmath99 .",

    "can only be invariant under at most one independent symmetry operation .",
    "however , states with particle numbers @xmath103 can satisfy up to @xmath80 independent symmetry operations leading to a suppression ratio @xmath104 . for comparison , figure  [ fig : suppratio ] illustrates the suppression ratios for bosons and fermions .      to exemplify the above suppression law ,",
    "a scattering scenario of @xmath105 bosons on the hc for @xmath37 dimensions is considered . in total",
    "there are @xmath106 possibilities to distribute the particles over the @xmath107 modes , whereof three initial states are chosen for discussion .",
    "for these states , figure  [ fig : pbexample ] shows the transition probabilities for all possible final states @xmath84 .",

    "these states are grouped in set  @xmath69 of figure  [ fig : pbexample ] , where the corresponding partitioning is visualized in the first inset .",
    "one representative of those is the final state @xmath118 containing three ( five ) bosons in modes @xmath85 for which @xmath117 ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the second initial state under consideration , @xmath119 , is invariant under the operations @xmath120 and @xmath68 and accordingly also under @xmath72 .",
    "thus , in addition to the suppressed final states for @xmath113 , states with an odd number of bosons in the subset of modes @xmath85 for which @xmath121 and an odd number in the subset of modes with @xmath122 must also be suppressed .",
    "this is shown in set  @xmath74 in figure  [ fig : pbexample ] .",
    "one representative of this set is the final state @xmath123 , exhibiting five ( three ) bosons in modes @xmath85 for which @xmath121 ( @xmath39 ) and three ( five ) bosons in modes @xmath85 for which @xmath122 ( @xmath39 ) . for clarity ,",
    "the second inset illustrates the partitionings for @xmath109 and @xmath110 .    in this scattering scenario ,",
    "the initial states with the largest number of invariant symmetry operations is given by @xmath124 .",
    "therefore , states with an odd number of bosons in the subset of modes @xmath85 for which @xmath125 must also be suppressed in addition to all states already suppressed for @xmath114 . in figure",
    "[ fig : pbexample ] , these states are grouped in set  @xmath76 , excluding those , already contained in set @xmath69 and @xmath74 .",
    "the corresponding inset shows the partitioning for @xmath111 .",
    "as a representative , the state @xmath126 is chosen , containing five ( three ) bosons in modes @xmath85 for which @xmath125 ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "all remaining final states that are not covered by the suppression law for any @xmath62 , like @xmath127 , are grouped in set  @xmath112 .    here",
    "it becomes apparent that the symmetry of many - body initial states determines a well structured appearance of total destructive interference on hc graphs .",
    "it also highlights the interdependence of different symmetry operations .",
    "for example , the initial state @xmath114 is invariant under two independent symmetry operations , namely @xmath120 and @xmath68 . from this",
    "follows that the state must be invariant under a composition of both operators as well .",
    "thus final states , which are suppressed for @xmath113 ( invariant under @xmath72 ) and covered by the suppression law , must also be suppressed for @xmath114 . however , since @xmath113 is only invariant under @xmath72 , states which are suppressed for @xmath114 are not necessarily suppressed for @xmath113 .",
    "figure  [ fig : pbexample ] also demonstrates the approximated suppression ratio  ( [ eq : suppratiobosons ] ) in dependence on the number of independent symmetries an initial state is invariant under . since @xmath113 is only invariant under @xmath72 , half of all final states",
    "are expected to be suppressed , as apparent by the size of set  @xmath69 in figure  [ fig : pbexample ] . for each further independent symmetry",
    ", one clearly sees the additional suppression of half of the remaining final states from the size reduction of the other sets .",
    "the derivations of the discussed hc suppression laws ( see appendix  [ aqq : suplawproof ] for details ) are exclusively based on symmetric connections between unitary elements with respect to predefined symmetry operations .",
    "thus , the suppression laws are not restricted to hc graphs as illustrated in figure  [ fig : hc3d ] and can be made applicable to different types of unitaries .",
    "this requires a proper redefinition of the symmetry operations  ( [ eq : s ] ) such that the symmetric connections between related unitary elements remain .",
    "now , in order to generalize the derived suppression laws , @xmath27-dimensional hc graphs are considered where each vertex consists of the same but arbitrary subgraph .",
    "each subgraph then contains @xmath128 modes which are referred to as subvertices in the following . besides the coupling within each subgraph ,",
    "each subvertex must be equally coupled to its @xmath27 identical counterparts in the predetermined hc ordering .",
    "this generalizes the model considerably since the nodes are allowed to have diverse internal degrees of freedom .",
    "such scenarios can be described by means of a @xmath129 subunitary @xmath130 , where the overall unitary @xmath131 consists of @xmath132 subunitaries . in order to retain the hc symmetries for _ segmentations _",
    "@xmath133 , the symmetry operations  ( [ eq : s ] ) are generalised to @xmath134 by replacing the pauli spin - x - operator with the exchange - operator @xmath135 of dimension @xmath136 , reading @xmath137 here @xmath138 denotes the @xmath129 null matrix and @xmath139 the @xmath129 identity matrix .",
    "these modifications are sufficient in order to make the symmetry suppression laws  ( [ eq : supplaw1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : supplaw2 ] ) applicable to any unitary given by  ( [ eq : unitarygen ] ) .",
    "the detailed proof is given in  [ app : generalproof ] .    remarkably , for symmetry reasons , the suppression laws for these generalized graphs require the symmetric occupation of all subvertices for initial states .",
    "however , for final states , only the total number of particles within the subgraphs is relevant .",
    "thus , the prediction whether or not a final state must be suppressed , is independent on its occupation within the subgraph , as will be further discussed in the following .      in order to illustrate the generalization , bosonic state transformations in one - dimensional hc graphs",
    "are considered .",
    "figure  [ fig : trion ] illustrates the mode coupling for identical subgraphs . here",
    ", related modes of different subgraphs are equally connected by the transition rate @xmath140 , whereas transition rates within subgraphs are arbitrary but identical .    .",
    "while the transition rates within the subgraph can be arbitrary ( indicated by connections of different size and color ) the transition rates between the subgraphs itself must equal @xmath140 . in @xmath69",
    "the subgraph is composed of a triangular graph , whereas in @xmath74 it is composed of an arbitrary long chain with @xmath128 modes.,width=377 ]    as apparent by the unitary  ( [ eq : unitarygen ] ) and by comparing figure  [ fig : trion]@xmath69 and [ fig : trion]@xmath74 , for the suppression law , generalized hc graphs of the same dimension are closely related , regardless of structure and size of the subgraphs .",
    "thus , we restrict the discussion of the examples shown in figure  [ fig : trion ] to the generalized graph with triangular subgraph .    considering the mode labelling as shown in figure  [ fig : trion]@xmath69 ,",
    "the four - particle initial state @xmath141 is invariant under symmetry operation  ( [ eq : symgen ] ) for @xmath109 .",
    "then , for an evolution time @xmath31 , the generalized suppression law predicts , that all final states with an odd number of particles on any subgraph must be suppressed .",
    "formally , this can be seen by considering definition  ( [ eq : partition ] ) , which gives @xmath142 for @xmath143 and @xmath144 for @xmath145 with @xmath146 in the discussed example .",
    "since each mode of a particular subgraph belongs to the same partitioning ( i.e. their partitioning value @xmath147 is equal ) , the condition for suppression appears independently of the particle occupation within the subgraphs .",
    "thus , for example the final states @xmath148 and @xmath149 must be suppressed for @xmath113 . however , in agreement with the formal suppression law , they appear with a non - vanishing probability for the initial state @xmath150 .",
    "this highlights that the condition for suppression strongly depends on the initial particle occupation within the subgraphs as determined by the invariance under the symmetry operations  ( [ eq : symgen ] ) , which @xmath114 does not fulfil .",
    "in this paper , we have shown that symmetries in many - particle quantum transport on hc graphs allow the formulation of analytic suppression laws , which predict final states occurring with a vanishing probability due to many - particle interference .",
    "specifically , each symmetry of the initial state groups all modes into two subsets of equal size and the occupation of these subsets determines the suppression . for bosons ,",
    "the suppression depends on the parity of this occupation . for fermions , on the other hand , all events with imbalanced occupation of the subsets",
    "are suppressed , giving rise to a much tighter restriction on allowed events as compared to bosons .",
    "this behaviour can be understood by regarding the hc as an extension of the 2-site coupler to higher dimensions : the forced splitting of fermions between the subsets , may be interpreted as a strong anti - bunching effect , while the distribution of bosons in sets of even parity is reminiscent of the multi - photon interference at the coupler @xcite .",
    "moreover , the suppression law holds for hcs with arbitrary identical subgraphs on all vertices .",
    "this illustrates that it is ultimately the symmetry of the unitary which governs the suppression , not necessarily a particular graph structure .",
    "as we have shown here for hc graphs , the emergence of symmetries in many - body state transformations of indistinguishable particles causes conceptional simplifications and allows the definite exclusion of certain outcomes . in the absence of any symmetry , however , no simple and exact examination for large many - body systems and their underlying dynamics is known , since the transition probabilities are governed by a coherent superposition of an exponentially growing number of transition amplitudes @xcite .",
    "thus , the suppression laws in hcs suit the certification of many - particle indistinguishability in large systems as , e.g. , required for the verification of any candidate boson - sampling device @xcite .    going beyond the single - particle regime may further be useful for applications in quantum information or for a better understanding of biological systems : just as two - particle interference lies at the heart of two - qubit gates in photonic quantum computing @xcite , many - particle interference might enhance existing or enable new types of quantum algorithms on the hc .",
    "regarding biological systems , it seems conceivable that many - particle dynamics are present in some cases , for which symmetries could be a first approach facilitating their further investigation , as nature appears to have developed mechanisms exhibiting macroscopic quantum effects @xcite .    for realisations of high - dimensional hcs one can make use of long - range connections @xcite or internal degrees of freedom @xcite , even if only fewer dimensions are available in the embedding physical space .",
    "particularly the latter approach has proven fruitful in recent years , with experiments successfully embedding @xmath151 dynamics in a @xmath152 atomic lattice @xcite and specific proposals being made for reducing the required physical dimension by 1 for optomechanical ( @xmath37 ) @xcite and optical systems ( @xmath153 ) @xcite .",
    "another promising route is offered by multi - mode - interference in optical fibers , potentially supporting graphs with highly - dimensional connectivity @xcite .",
    "the authors would like to thank andreas buchleitner and stefan fischer for fruitful discussions and acknowledge support by the austrian science fund ( fwf projects i 2562-n27 and m 1849 ) and the canadian institute for advanced research ( cifar , quantum information science program ) .",
    "the derivation of the suppression laws is based on the expression of unitary elements according to  ( [ eq : uelement ] ) .",
    "this is obtained by considering the accumulation of @xmath49 phase terms for elements @xmath154 due to subsequent applications of tensor powers in  ( [ eq : u ] ) , which leads to @xmath155\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] analogously , additional phase terms are taken into account for columns @xmath85 , @xmath156x(j,2^m)\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] plugging  ( [ eq : uderiv1 ] ) into  ( [ eq : uderiv2 ] ) results in  ( [ eq : uelement ] ) after some algebraic steps .",
