    "the study of self - propelling micro - robots is a flourishing modern research topic , striving to create a fundamental base for modern applications in medicine and technology , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "we define _ self - propulsion _ as the motion of a micro - robot which is subjected to zero external total force .",
    "the simplicity of micro - robots geometry represents a major advantage in contrast to the extreme complexity of self - swimming microorganisms .",
    "this advantage allows us to describe the motions of micro - robots in greater depth .",
    "the major problem in the designing of a micro - robot is the need for an external source of energy to provide for its oscillatory behaviour .",
    "proposed sources include an oscillating ( or rotating ) magnetic field ( see @xcite ) , an electric field ( see @xcite ) , and even molecular brownian forces ( see @xcite ) . at the same time",
    ", the major oscillatory forces available in fluid have not been exploited ; these are the forces caused by fluid oscillations which are imposed by periodically varying boundary conditions , waves , or turbulence .",
    "the ratio of characteristic spatial scales ( several microns for a micro - robot _ vs. _ millimeters , centimeters , or greater scales for flow oscillations ) makes it clear that the first problem to study is the behaviour of a micro - robot in a fluid that oscillates as a rigid body .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the self - propulsion of a two - sphere _",
    "buoyancy_-driven _ dumbbell _ micro - robot ( we call it",
    "_ bd_-robot , see the figure ) .",
    "the whole micro - robot is neutrally buoyant ( in order to avoid sedimentation ) ; one of its spherical beads is positively buoyant and the other is negatively buoyant .",
    "we study two versions of _ bd_-robots . in the first one",
    "the beads are connected by a rod of prescribed oscillating length , in the second one the beads are linked by an elastic spring .",
    "first , we study the case of a rod and , next , we consider the changes that appear after replacing the rod with a spring .",
    "a mathematical formulation of the problem leads us to the study of creeping motions with time - periodic forces .",
    "the problem is solved by employing a version of the two - timing method and distinguished limit arguments , developed in @xcite .",
    "the approach allows any motion of _",
    "bd_-robot to be described analytically .",
    "our calculations show that , generally , the _ bd_-robot participates in both translational and rotational motion .",
    "rectilinear translational self - propulsion with constant velocity represents a special case of this solution .",
    "we have calculated the velocity of rectilinear self - propulsion and the ranges of governing parameters that correspond to translational motions .",
    "the _ bd_-robot represents a dumbbell configuration , which consists of two homogeneous rigid spherical beads of different radii @xmath0 , @xmath1 connected by a rod of length @xmath2 ( see the figure ) .",
    "we study two - dimensional motions of a tree - dimensional dumbbell in cartesian coordinates @xmath3 .",
    "the centers of the spheres @xmath4 are described as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the radius - vector of a center of reaction .",
    "the axis of symmetry of a dumbbell is given by the vector @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "the unit vectors @xmath9 , @xmath10 and the angle @xmath11 are given by @xmath12 where the subscript @xmath11 stands for @xmath13 .",
    "the length @xmath2 is changing periodically @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a constant averaged value and @xmath16 is a @xmath17-periodic function of @xmath18 with zero average value ( throughout the paper a ` tilde ' above a function of time denotes that this function is oscillating and has zero mean value ) .",
    "the spheres experience external friction forces @xmath19 while the rod is so thin ( in comparison with either @xmath0 ) that its interaction with the fluid can be considered negligible .",
    "we consider the motions of a _ bd_-robot in a viscous incompressible fluid which , in the absence of the _ bd_-robot , oscillates as a rigid body .",
    "these rigid - body oscillations are prescribed as a two - dimensional translational spatial displacement @xmath20 of fluid particles ( at infinity in space ) ; the related acceleration is @xmath21 , where the subscripts stand for related derivatives .",
    "the problem can be studied in an oscillating ( non - inertial ) system of reference , in which a fluid at infinity is in a state of rest . in this frame , according to einstein s principle of equivalence , or according to a related transformation of a lagrangian function , the equations of fluid motion are standard , however , they contain an additional oscillating gravity force @xmath22 which causes buoyancy forces @xmath23 , where the coefficient @xmath24 is equal to the difference in the mass of a sphere and the mass of a displaced fluid ; @xmath24 can be either positive or negative .",
    "the potential energy of a sphere is @xmath25 .",
    "we consider a _",
    "bd_-robot of neutral total buoyancy , with total potential energy @xmath26 the problem formulation contains three characteristic lengths : the length of the rod @xmath15 , the radius of the spheres @xmath27 , and the amplitude of the rod s oscillation @xmath28 .",
    "in addition we have the characteristic time - scale @xmath29 , excess mass @xmath30 , gravity @xmath31 , and viscous force @xmath32 .",
    "we have chosen these scales as @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the fluid viscosity .",
    "the dimensionless variables ( marked with asterisks ) are @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "three independent small parameters of the problem are @xmath42 below we use only dimensionless variables , however all asterisks are omitted . note , that in the chosen dimensionless units , @xmath43 .",
    "we choose the generalised coordinates of _ bd_-robot to be @xmath44 .",
    "the motion of the _ bd_-robot , with a given @xmath45 ( [ constraint ] ) , is described by the lagrangian function @xmath46 , which includes the constraint ( [ constraint ] ) with lagrangian multiplier @xmath47 @xmath48 where @xmath49 , and @xmath50 are kinetic energy and potential energy ( [ pi ] ) of _ bd_-robot ; @xmath47 represents an additional unknown function of time .",
    "the lagrange equations are @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the generalized external viscous force , exerted by a fluid on the _ bd_-robot .",
    "as one can see , we use latin subscripts ( @xmath53 ) for cartesian components of vectors and tensors , subscript @xmath54 for generalised coordinates , and subscripts ( or superscripts ) @xmath55 to identify the spheres .",
    "we accept , that the fluid flow past _ bd_-robot is described by the stokes equations , where all inertial terms are neglected . in the consistent approximation",
    "the mass of a rod and masses of the spheres are negligible , hence @xmath56 .",
    "therefore ( [ lagr - contstr]),([lagr - eqns]),([notations ] ) give use to the following system of equations @xmath57 which is supplemented by constraint ( [ constraint ] ) .",
    "the great advantage of a lagrangian formalism is its self - sufficiency . in particular , the conditions of zero force ( [ sum - forces ] ) and the balance of torques ( [ sum - torques ] ) appear automatically , while eqn.([eqns - reactions ] ) allows us to find the reaction of constraint @xmath47 . in ( [ sum - torques]),([eqns - reactions ] )",
    "we have accepted that @xmath58 with constant @xmath59 ; this is our physical assumption , which states that two small parameters @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( out of three parameters in the list ( [ small - par ] ) ) are of the same order .",
    "physically , it means that the difference between the densities ( of each sphere and the fluid ) or the amplitude of oscillations of the fluid is small ( or both these parameters are small ) .",
    "the explicit expressions for @xmath62 are @xmath63 each force @xmath62 represents the first approximation ( with the error @xmath64 ) for the stokes friction force exerted on a sphere moving in a flow field generated by another sphere . to construct ( [ forces - stokes ] )",
    "we use a classical explicit formula for the fluid velocity past a moving sphere , see @xcite .",
    "( [ sum - forces])-([forces - stokes ] ) represent a system of four equations for four unknown functions of time :  @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath11 , and @xmath47 . for the prescribed @xmath2 ( [ constraint ] ) , the equation ( [ eqns - reactions ] ) need not to be considered if we are interested only in the motion of the micro - robot and are not calculating of reaction force @xmath47 . for future use , we rewrite ( [ sum - forces]),([sum - torques ] ) as @xmath67=0\\label{forces - iso}\\\\ & & { \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}\\cdot\\left[{\\boldsymbol{l}}_t+\\delta \\mathbb{s}(r^-{\\boldsymbol{x}}_t+\\kappa{\\boldsymbol{l}}_t)\\right]=-2\\varepsilon\\alpha{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}\\cdot\\widetilde{{\\boldsymbol{g}}}/\\kappa \\label{torq - iso}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 .",
    "the following _ dimensionless _ notations and definitions are in use :    \\(i ) @xmath69 and @xmath18 denote slow and fast times ; subscripts @xmath18 and @xmath69 stand for related partial derivatives .",
    "\\(ii ) a dimensionless function , say @xmath70 , belongs to the class @xmath71 if @xmath72 and all partial @xmath69- , and @xmath18-derivatives of @xmath73 ( required for our consideration ) are also @xmath74 . in this paper",
    "all functions belong to class @xmath71 , while all small parameters appear as explicit multipliers .",
    "\\(iii ) we consider only _ functions periodic in @xmath18 _ @xmath75 , where @xmath69-dependence is not specified .",
    "hence , all functions considered below belong to @xmath76 .",
    "\\(iv ) for arbitrary @xmath77 the _ averaging operation _ is @xmath78",
    "\\(v ) _ the oscillating part of an integral _ is : @xmath79    \\(vi ) _ the tilde - function _ ( or purely oscillating function ) represents a special case of @xmath80-function with zero average @xmath81 .",
    "the _ bar - function _ ( or mean - function ) @xmath82 does not depend on @xmath18 . for any periodic function",
    "@xmath73 a unique decomposition @xmath83 is valid .",
    "the introduction of a fast time variable @xmath18 and a slow time variable @xmath69 represents a crucial step in our asymptotic procedure .",
    "we choose @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "this choice can be justified by the same distinguished limit arguments as in @xcite . here",
    "we present this choice without proof , however , its most important part ( that this choice leads to a valid asymptotic procedure ) is exposed and exploited below .",
    "we use the chain rule @xmath86 and then we accept ( temporarily ) that @xmath18 and @xmath69 represent two independent variables . further more we consider series expansions in the small parameter @xmath60 and",
    "restrict our attention to terms which are at most @xmath87 .",
    "simultaneously , we keep at most linear in @xmath88 terms",
    ". it does not mean that in our setting @xmath89 , since in all expressions @xmath88 appears not separately but as products with various degrees of @xmath60 .",
    "hence , we do not specify the dependence of unknown functions on @xmath88 ; such dependence reveals itself naturally during the calculations .",
    "the unknown functions are taken as regular series in @xmath60 @xmath90 with a similar expression for @xmath11 .",
    "we accept that @xmath91 which express a basic property of our solutions that long distances of self - swimming and large angles of rotation are caused by small oscillations .",
    "the application of ( [ chain ] ) to ( [ x - f - ser ] ) gives @xmath92 and a similar expression for @xmath11 . in the calculations below all bar - functions belong to the zero approximation , while all tilde - functions belong to the first approximation ; therefore we omit the related subscripts .",
    "the successive approximations of equations ( [ forces - iso]),([torq - iso ] ) yield :    _ terms _ @xmath93 give the identities @xmath94 .    _ terms _ @xmath95 lead to @xmath96 the use of ( [ units ] ) transforms the second equation to the form @xmath97 .",
    "then the integration of ( [ first - order ] ) in the class of periodic functions yields @xmath98    _ terms _ @xmath99 : these terms do not vanish and can be easily calculated .",
    "however , as one can see below , they do not participate in the leading terms of the average motion that appear in the orders @xmath87 and @xmath100 .",
    "_ terms _ @xmath87 : eqns.([forces - iso])),([first - order-2 ] ) give @xmath101 where we have used the integration by parts in the average operation ( [ oper-1 ] ) . the use of the definition of matrix @xmath102 ( [ forces - stokes ] ) and ( [ units ] ) yield @xmath103 .",
    "then ( [ eqn - x-2 ] ) takes the form @xmath104 similarly , from ( [ torq - iso ] ) , we can derive the equation for @xmath105 and obtain the system of equations @xmath106 where we have used the equality @xmath107 , which is valid by virtue of ( [ notations]),([oper-1 ] ) , and @xmath108 .",
    "one can see , that the dynamics of a dumbbell is determined by the values of two parameters @xmath109 , @xmath110 and by three correlations @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 .",
    "we can make a general conclusion , based on ( [ x - phi - final ] ) , that the mean translational velocity is always perpendicular to the mean symmetry axes of a dumbbell ( @xmath114 is directed along the normal vector @xmath115 ) .",
    "the simplest motion takes place when @xmath116 .",
    "physically , it means that fluid oscillations are unidirectional , see ( [ gravity ] ) . in this case",
    "equations ( [ x - phi - final ] ) produce the integral @xmath117 with a vectorial constant of integration @xmath118 .",
    "this equality shows that @xmath119 changes along a circular path ( or along an arc of a circle ) of small radius @xmath120 .",
    "the equation for @xmath105 ( [ x - phi - final ] ) can be integrated exactly . for unidirectional oscillations along the @xmath121-axis , when @xmath122 ( [ gravity ] ) , the second equation ( [ x - phi - final ] ) takes the form @xmath123 .",
    "it can be integrated , having an initial value @xmath124 , as @xmath125 which shows that for @xmath126 we have @xmath127 ; it means that the axis of symmetry of a dumbbell is turning monotonically towards the direction of oscillations .",
    "equation ( [ x-0 ] ) describes the simultaneous change of @xmath128 along the arc of a small circle .",
    "it is clear , that in the general case of unidirectional oscillations along any direction ( different from @xmath121 ) , the result is the same : the axis of the dumbbell asymptotically approaches the direction parallel to the oscillations , and @xmath128 changes along the arc of a small circle .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that any unidirectional oscillations of the fluid do not result in the self - propulsion of the _ bd_-robot .      for @xmath129",
    "we first consider motions without rotation @xmath130 . in these cases",
    "the angular part of ( [ x - phi - final ] ) gives @xmath131 , which immediately leads to @xmath132 physically , the restriction ( [ phi - line - cond ] ) means that the _ bd_-robot can move without rotation if the oscillations @xmath16 are ` strong enough ' . in this case the first eqn . in ( [ x - phi - final ] )",
    "gives @xmath133 , which shows that the _ bd_-robot moves with constant speed @xmath134 in the fixed direction @xmath115 , which is given by the angle @xmath135 ( [ phi - line ] ) , where the sign is determined by the correlation @xmath111 .",
    "striving for more general results , one can show , that the system ( [ x - phi - final ] ) can be integrated analytically in the general case @xmath136 , with the conclusion , that if the parameters satisfy ( [ phi - line - cond ] ) then a trajectory with any initial data @xmath137 asymptotically ( when @xmath126 ) approaches the same straight paths ( [ phi - line ] ) as described above . exact integration outside of the range of parameters ( [ phi - line - cond ] ) is also accessible analytically ; it produces motions with rotation @xmath138 , which we do not consider in this paper .",
    "let us consider a particular example @xmath139 for @xmath140 the _ bd_-robot propels itself with constant speed @xmath141 along a straight path @xmath142 .",
    "it is remarkable , that the self - propulsion speed @xmath143 does not depend on the amplitude @xmath144 .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that such solutions are available only for ` strong ' oscillations , when @xmath145 ; for ` very strong ' oscillations , when @xmath146 , we have @xmath147 .",
    "the above results correspond to the prescribed periodic function @xmath148 ( [ constraint ] ) , which can be chosen arbitrary and represents a given time - dependent constraint",
    ". however , in practice , the oscillations @xmath16 produced by the forces exerted from an oscillating fluid on the beads , are more interesting .",
    "a simple way to consider such oscillations is to replace the rod with a spring of stiffness @xmath149 . in this case",
    "the dimensionless lagrangian function ( [ lagr - contstr ] ) and potential energy ( [ pi ] ) become @xmath150 one can check that for this lagrangian function the equations for total force and torque ( [ sum - forces]),([sum - torques ] ) remain the same , while the equation for the reaction of constraint ( [ eqns - reactions ] ) must be replaced with @xmath151 the relation between the problem for an elastic @xmath152-robot and the previous problem for a @xmath152-robot with the arbitrary oscillation of a rod is evident : the latter considers all possible solutions , while the former corresponds to a special subclass of @xmath148 only , that appears as the result of spring oscillations .",
    "hence the ability for self - propulsion can only ` worsen ' after the introduction of a spring .",
    "the order @xmath153 equation ( [ eqns - reactions - a ] ) produces a linear equation for @xmath16 @xmath154 it gives us @xmath148 which must be substituted into @xmath155 and @xmath156 in ( [ x - phi - final ] ) instead of an arbitrary chosen function @xmath16 .",
    "the rest of the problem remains unchanged .",
    "the general solution of ( [ eqn - l - a ] ) can be obtained analytically in an integral form , or in the form of a fourier series .",
    "both forms are rather cumbersome and are not considered in this paper .",
    "instead , we present an example for a gravity field @xmath157 , @xmath158 that coincides with ( [ example ] ) . the related solution of ( [ eqn - l - a ] ) is @xmath159,\\ p\\equiv -\\gamma b \\sin\\overline{\\varphi } , \\",
    "n\\equiv \\gamma a \\cos\\overline{\\varphi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where an exponentially decreasing complementary solution has been dropped .",
    "it leads to an explicit formula for @xmath160 ( [ psi ] ) @xmath161\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which determines the system of equations ( [ x - phi - final ] ) .",
    "in this case we obtain the following equations for the motion without rotation ( @xmath162 ) @xmath163 we can see , that any direction of a rectilinear self - propulsion can be arranged by an appropriate choice of @xmath28 and @xmath164 .",
    "it is also interesting that the speed of self - propulsion , @xmath143 , does not depend on the spring stiffness @xmath165 ; however , the required condition @xmath166 shows that both a small and high stiffness do not lead to rectilinear motion .",
    "another interesting conclusion is : for rectilinear motion to exist , the values of vibrational amplitudes @xmath28 and",
    "@xmath164 can not be chosen close to each other .",
    "it means that imposed vibrations ( [ gravity ] ) must be anisotropic ( the circular vibrations with @xmath167 and close to them are excluded ) .",
    "again , for @xmath136 , @xmath166 the system of equations ( [ x - phi - final]),([psi1 ] ) can be integrated analytically .",
    "the integration shows that any trajectory asymptotically ( for @xmath126 ) approaches ( [ elastic - mot ] ) . in the case",
    "@xmath168 the full system ( [ x - phi - final]),([psi1 ] ) also allows explicit analytical integration ; it leads to the motions with rotation @xmath138 , which we do not consider in this paper .",
    "\\(i ) our choice of slow time @xmath85 ( [ chain ] ) agrees with classical studies of self - propulsion for low reynolds numbers , see @xcite , as well as the geometric studies of @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) the scale of slow time @xmath85 implies that in order to obtain physical dimensionless velocities we have to multiply @xmath114 and @xmath169 ( [ x - phi - final ] ) by @xmath170 .",
    "accordingly , the mean translational velocity @xmath171 , while mean angular velocity @xmath172 .",
    "\\(iii ) we have built an asymptotic procedure with two small parameters : @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "such a setting usually requires the consideration of different asymptotic paths on the plane @xmath175 when , say @xmath176 . in our case",
    "we can avoid this additional analysis , since @xmath88 does not appear separately , but only in combinations like @xmath177 .",
    "\\(iv ) in this paper we consider only plane motions of a three - dimensional dumbbell .",
    "this class of motions corresponds to two - dimensional oscillations / gravity ( [ gravity ] ) . at the same time , for experimental realization , it could be necessary to solve a full three - dimensional problem .",
    "\\(v ) for the first experimental studies of self - propulsion of the _",
    "bd_-robot one can consider : rigid - body oscillations of a fluid , enclosed within a vibrating container ; the viscous flows , caused by oscillatory boundary conditions ; or the oscillations of a fluid due to an external acoustic wave .",
    "\\(vi ) the calculated velocities of self - propulsion are much smaller than flow oscillations and can be even smaller than some secondary flows ( like acoustic streaming ) . in this case , one may look for situations when a slow ( but permanent ) self - propulsion leading to new physical effects or providing advantages in applications .",
    "\\(vii ) it is well known , that an oscillating dumbbell is able to self - swim when an oscillating external torque , exerted on a dumbbell , is present ; the related discussion can be found in @xcite .",
    "the self - swimming of a magnetically driven oscillating dumbbell has been studied by @xcite .",
    "\\(viii ) our approach is technically different from all previous methods employed in the studies of micro - robots .",
    "the possibility to describe any motion of a _",
    "bd_-robot explicitly , shows the strength and analytical simplicity of our method .",
    "the studies of different micro - robots by the same method ( as in this paper ) can be found in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the same method resulted in a new asymptotic model and a new equation ( _ the acoustic - drift equation _ ) for the averaged flows generated by acoustic waves .",
