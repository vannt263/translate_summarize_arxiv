    "hydraulic fracture is a process of a crack propagating in a solid material , as a result of pressurized liquid injection .",
    "it can be observed in many natural phenomena , like magma driven dykes @xcite , sub - glacial drainage of water @xcite and others @xcite .",
    "recently it has been used for reservoir stimulation in the oil and gas industry to maximize hydrocarbon extraction .",
    "although this technology can be backdated to the 1930s @xcite , it has been in the last twenty years that hydrofracturing has become commonplace .",
    "mathematical modeling of this multiphysics process is a challenging task .",
    "the main difficulties are : ( a ) strong non - linearities related to the interaction between the solid and fluid phases ,",
    "( b ) singularities in the physical fields near the fracture front , ( c ) moving boundaries , ( d ) degeneration of the governing equations in the near - tip region , ( e ) pronounced multiscale effects .",
    "the complexity of the problem necessitates various simplifications dated back to works of @xcite . these studies",
    "together with the later works led to the formulation of the basic 1d models of hydraulic fractures : i ) the pkn model @xcite , ii ) the kgd model @xcite , iii ) the radial or penny shaped model @xcite . however , in the 1980s the need for more advanced and accurate modeling emerged .",
    "the so called pseudo 3d models ( p3d ) appeared @xcite .",
    "they approximate the behaviour of the planar 3d fractures , including those in the stratified reservoirs , with minimal computational costs .",
    "another attempt at advancing the mathematical modeling was the introduction of the planar 3d models ( pl3d ) @xcite , in which case the crack footprint and the internal fluid flow are described by the 2d mesh of cells and combined with the full 3d elasticity equations , allowing one to determine the fracture aperture as a function of the fluid pressure . in recent years , there have also been attempts to develop full 3d models utilizing various numerical techniques , e.g. finite element method @xcite , boundary element method ( or combination of the two @xcite ) , the discrete element methods @xcite or other techniques @xcite .",
    "a broad review of the topic can be found in @xcite where it is has been shown that , in spite of substantial progress made , there is still a demand for further improvements in efficiency and credibility of computations to tackle multiscale effects , complex geometries and properties of the rock and fracturing fluids , and to possibly perform the computations in real time",
    ".    alongside the development of mathematical models , fundamental research , aimed at identifying the basic solution features related to the underlying physics of the process , has been carried out .",
    "special attention has been paid to the near - tip behaviour of the solution .",
    "the early works introducing the correct tip asymptotics can be backdated to the 1980s ( - for the kgd model , @xcite - for the pkn model ) .",
    "more comprehensive studies on this problem were presented in @xcite for the zero toughness impermeable case , in @xcite for the zero toughness leak - off dominated variant . in @xcite , the near - tip process in an impermeable elastic medium for the plane strain conditions was modeled with the account of a lag between the fracture tip and the fluid front .",
    "@xcite have proposed asymptotic solutions in the case of a penny shaped fracture driven by the newtonian fluid for both small and large toughness values .",
    "the analysis for plain strain and penny shaped fractures propagating in the toughness dominated regime in permeable rock was delivered in @xcite , giving the early and large time asymptotes .",
    "results pertaining to the plain strain fracture driven by the shear - thinning fluids can be found in @xcite .",
    "simultaneously , recognition of the importance of the near - tip behaviour of solutions has led to classification of the basic fracture propagation modes @xcite .",
    "they have been categorized in the parametric space which is encompassed by four limiting physical regimes : i ) leak - off dominated , ii ) storage dominated , iii ) toughness dominated , iv ) viscosity dominated .",
    "the hydraulic fracture is considered to evolve in time between these specific modes depending on the injection rate , the rock and fracturing fluid properties .",
    "a number of semi - analytical and numerical solutions have been constructed for such asymptotic regimes . in particular ,",
    "the case of zero toughness impermeable rock was analyzed in @xcite , small toughness zero - leak - off variant in @xcite , large toughness impermeable in @xcite , and finite toughness permeable in @xcite .",
    "all these efforts have underlined the importance of the multiscale character of the problem .",
    "it is now well understood that the coupling between non - linear , non - local and history dependent physical fields results in a complex solution structure , where relative importance of the mentioned processes depends on temporal and spatial scales .",
    "it has been proved that the global behaviour of a fluid driven fracture is controlled by the near - tip region , and this has consequences for the computational implementation .",
    "furthermore , in the hydraulic fracture problem , the nature of the moving boundary results in degeneration of the governing equations and the boundary conditions at the crack tip , which makes tracing the fracture front an extremely difficult task @xcite . all these factors clearly indicate the challenge in understanding the solution structure ( especially the tip asymptotics ) and its appropriate application in the computational schemes . in the recent studies by @xcite",
    "it has been shown that the algorithms which use the appropriate multi - scale hydraulic fracture asymptote in the near tip region provide much better results than those which do not apply it . moreover , when accounting for the proper tip asymptotics , very good results can be obtained even for coarse meshing .",
    "the analysis given in @xcite proves that proper mathematical formulation of the problem of hydraulic fracture facilitates the correct introduction of the basic asymptotic features of the solution to the numerical algorithm .",
    "this in turn results in an appreciable improvement to the accuracy and efficiency of computations .    we propose a new unified approach that yields universal numerical algorithm capable of tackling various hf models .",
    "its basic assumptions are : i ) proper choice of independent and dependent variables ( including a new one - the reduced particle velocity ) , ii ) tracing the fracture front by use of the stefan condition ( speed equation ) which can be integrated in a closed form to give an explicit relation between the crack propagation speed and the leading coefficients of the crack opening asymptotics , iii ) proper regularization techniques , iv ) improved numerical approximation of the temporal derivative of the solution , v ) modular algorithm architecture .",
    "the application of the new dependent variable , the reduced particle velocity , instead of the usual fluid flow rate , facilitates the computation of the crack propagation speed from the local relation based on the speed equation . this way we avoid numerical evaluation of the undetermined limit of the product of fracture aperture and pressure gradient at the crack tip ( or alternatively the limit resulting from division of the fluid flow rate by the crack opening ) , which poses a considerable computational challenge . as a result",
    "the position of the crack front can be accurately determined explicitly . with regards to the numerical modeling of hydraulic fractures ,",
    "this condition was originally introduced by kemp @xcite but was later abandoned .",
    "recently , it has been rediscovered by linkov ( @xcite ) .",
    "the tip asymptotics is utilized in the numerical scheme together with appropriate regularization techniques .",
    "some elements of the employed scheme have been presented in @xcite , where a broad discussion on the advantages of application of proper dependent variables and regularization techniques can be found .",
    "one of the key points of the developed universal algorithm is utilization of the explicit relation between the crack propagation speed and the leading terms of the crack opening asymptotic expansion in the form  . for the pkn model",
    "it was found and described in @xcite , while for the kgd formulation respective results have been recently reported at a number of conferences .",
    "the above developments lead to a robust and efficient numerical scheme .",
    "its performance is demonstrated against classical 1d models : pkn and kgd ones .",
    "the solution accuracy is verified against analytical benchmarks and solutions available in the literature .",
    "most of the ideas developed here , can be directly extended to more general 2d and 3d cases .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 a general mathematical description of the problem",
    "moreover the basic idea of fracture front tracing is explained , also the motivation for and advantages of the applied approach are presented .",
    "we introduce here a dimensionless formulation of the problem , which is henceforth used .",
    "section 3 contains a detailed characterization of the solution tip asymptotics , and its link to the mechanism of crack tip tracing .",
    "a universal mathematical description is proposed for different elasticity operators and crack propagation regimes .",
    "a complete definition of the mechanism of crack front tracing based on the speed equation ( stefan condition ) is given .",
    "in section 4 , a new dependent variable , the reduced particle velocity , is introduced .",
    "the governing equations are reformulated in terms of the new variable .",
    "section 5 describes the reduction of the problem to a self - similar version for two different time - dependent functions : the power function and the exponential one .",
    "then the self - similar variant of the universal algorithm is presented .",
    "the performance of the algorithm is verified against dedicated analytical benchmarks ( detailed description in appendix ) as well as the reference solutions available in the literature .",
    "fully analytical benchmarks for the kgd variant of the problem are introduced here for the first time . in section 6 ,",
    "the idea of a universal solver is adapted to the transient case where the improved approximation of the temporal derivative is one of the key elements .",
    "extensive accuracy analysis is given .",
    "final discussions and conclusions are presented in section 7 .",
    "let us consider a rectilinear crack @xmath0 fully filled by newtonian fluid injected at midpoint ( @xmath1 ) at a given rate @xmath2 . as a result , the crack front ( @xmath3 ) moves and",
    "the crack length , @xmath4 , is a function of time .",
    "below we present a classic set of the governing equations for the 1d formulation of the problem , which can be found in e.g. @xcite for various hydrofracturing models . as usual ,",
    "due to symmetry of the problem , we analyse only one of the symmetrical parts of the crack @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "the continuity equation has the form : @xmath6 the fluid flow inside the fracture is described by the poiseuille equation which , in case of newtonian fluid , is described as : @xmath7    in the above equations @xmath8 stands for the crack opening , @xmath9 is the fluid flow rate , @xmath10 ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 - confining stress ) refers to the net fluid pressure .",
    "constant @xmath13 is computed as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 denotes the dynamic viscosity .",
    "function @xmath16 , in the right - hand side of the continuity equation , is the volumetric rate of fluid loss due to the rock formation in the direction perpendicular to the crack surfaces per unit length of the fracture .",
    "usually it is assumed to be given ( local formulation ) @xcite .",
    "more accurate analysis involves a nonlocal formulation where the mass transfer in the entire external domain should be taken into account @xcite .",
    "we will comment on the possible behaviour of @xmath17 later on .",
    "these equations are to be supplemented by the relation describing the deformation of rock under applied hydraulic pressure .",
    "thus , the net pressure in the fracture is given by the relationship : @xmath18 where operator @xmath19 refers to the chosen model of elasticity ( which assumes the predefined fracture geometry ) .",
    "we consider two most popular linear models ( local and nonlocal , respectively ) :    * the pkn model @xcite @xmath20 * the kgd model @xcite @xmath21    in the pkn model , constant @xmath22 was given by @xcite for an elliptical crack of height @xmath23 , while @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the elasticity modulus and poisson s ratio .",
    "constant @xmath26 in the kgd model follows , for example , from @xcite : @xmath27 the multiplier @xmath22 may depend on @xmath28 and/or @xmath29 as well : @xmath30 , constituting the so - called pseudo 3d model ( p3d ) @xcite .",
    "this case can also be considered in the framework of the presented approach .",
    "the inverse operators for  are : @xmath31 @xmath32 note that the original cauchy type singular integral in the elasticity equation ( [ elastic_kgd ] ) is defined ( compare @xcite ) over the entire crack , @xmath33 , and that representation ( [ elastic_kgd ] ) is valid only under the assumption @xmath34 on the other hand , the form of the integral operator @xmath35 guarantees this property if the net pressure is smooth enough ( differentiable ) near the zero point and the following condition holds : @xmath36 that is easily checked by differentiation .",
    "this condition has a clear physical sense : the stress intensity factor ( sif ) defined by the integral in ( [ cond_net_pressure ] ) is finite .",
    "thus , when equation ( [ inverse_kgd ] ) instead of ( [ elastic_kgd ] ) is utilized , ( [ bc_3 ] ) is satisfied automatically .",
    "moreover , using condition ( [ cond_net_pressure ] ) one can also prove that @xmath37    the foregoing equations should be supplemented by the initial and boundary conditions .",
    "thus , the influx boundary condition and two boundary conditions at the crack tip are : @xmath38 @xmath39    we use in this paper the non - zero initial conditions : @xmath40 usually , the uniform initial conditions are suggested instead ( e.g @xcite ) : @xmath41 however , for time dependent problems , it is quite common to replace them by the condition ( [ ic ] ) , where small values of @xmath42 and @xmath43 for @xmath44 are taken from the corresponding self - similar solution which neglects the leak - off to the formation ( early time asymptote ) .",
    "note that the condition ( [ ic ] ) describes then a preexisting hydraulic fracture .    in the case when fracture evolution is analyzed in the framework of linear elastic fracture mechanics ( lefm ) , that is for the the toughness driven regime for the kgd model ,",
    "the following propagation condition is imposed : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the material toughness @xcite while @xmath47 is the already mentioned sif computed by the following formula @xcite ( compare ): @xmath48 note that the tip asymptote for the crack opening is defined in this case as : @xmath49    finally , the global fluid balance equation takes the form : @xmath50dx-\\int_{0}^tq_0(t)dt+\\int_0^{l(t)}\\int_{0}^tq_l(t , x)dtdx=0.\\ ] ] which is usually used to determine the crack length ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    the above set of equations and conditions constitute the classical 1-d model of hydraulic fracture @xcite .    in our analysis",
    "we will utilize another dependent variable , the average fluid velocity through the fracture cross - sections ( called also a particle velocity ) , @xmath51 , defined as follows : @xmath52 this variable has been frequently mentioned in publications ( see for example @xcite ) , but has not been used directly in computational algorithms . in @xcite it was suggested to incorporate it as a dependent variable instead of the net pressure or the fluid flux in order to improve the algorithm performance .",
    "our analysis follows this suggestion .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume that there are no flow stagnation or inversion points along the fracture , which means that @xmath53 should be finite and positive .",
    "@xmath54 as a result , the spacial derivative of the net pressure is negative along the entire fracture @xmath55 taking into account the fact that the crack opening vanishes at the crack tip ( compare ( [ bc_2])@xmath56 ) , equation yields @xmath57      tracing the fracture front evolution is one of the major challenges in the problem of hydraulic fracture . in the recent paper by @xcite , various approaches to this task have been discussed . in the numerical scheme proposed in sections 5 - 6 below",
    ", we use a strategy for finding the fracture tip different from that advocated in @xcite .",
    "note that the above - mentioned paper briefly discusses our approach but this discussion may be misleading . for this reason and in order to eliminate any confusion , we clarify the key points of our approach .",
    "we emphasize that the standard methods of simulating hydrofracturing mostly employ the crack opening , @xmath58 , and the fluid flow rate , @xmath59 as the dependent variables .",
    "this allows one to directly account for respective boundary conditions at the fracture tip ( compare ( [ bc_2 ] ) ) , and has other benefits discussed in @xcite .",
    "however , when determining the crack tip position , this approach causes serious difficulties , as comprehensively analysed in @xcite , where in particular , the authors pointed out the major computational problem of evaluation of the fluid front velocity ( @xmath60 ) from the equation @xmath61 where both dependent variables vanish at the crack tip .",
    "our approach utilizes different pair of dependent variables : i ) the standard one - the crack opening @xmath58 , and ii ) the particle velocity ( the average through a channel cross section fluid flow velocity ) , @xmath62 , instead of the fluid flux , @xmath59 ) .",
    "the next crucial assumption used in our paper is a condition that + @xmath63 _ * the particle velocity has finite value at the crack front*_. + this assumption is satisfied for most hydraulic fracture models , with some reservations in the cases of severe leak - off regimes ( e.g. fluid driven regime for the kgd model combined with a carter law - see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "note that the assumption has a clear physical motivation as all the basic equations were derived neglecting the inertia effects ( no acceleration terms are present in them ) . obviously , the finite velocity of the fracture tip is consistent with experiments @xcite .",
    "the first consequence of the chosen set of dependent variables is that , when the first of the conditions ( [ bc_2 ] ) is satisfied , the second one is fulfilled automatically .",
    "moreover , the difficulties mentioned in @xcite , as well as those related to computing of the crack propagation speed from relation are fully eliminated .",
    "naturally , this new approach requires reformulation of all the governing equations in terms of the new dependent variables @xmath58 and @xmath62 .",
    "however , one needs to find : + @xmath64 _ the relationship between the crack propagation speed , @xmath65 , and the finite fluid front velocity , @xmath66 . _",
    "+ this question is not specific to our approach .",
    "it arises in any formulation of the hydraulic fracture problem ( which is not always , however , clearly highlighted ) . as stated in @xcite , the case where the fluid front coincides with the fracture tip",
    "is much more challenging from the computational point of view . in problems with moving boundaries such a condition",
    "is usually called _ the stefan condition _ @xcite . in mathematical modeling of hydraulic fractures it was probably kemp",
    "@xcite who first explicitly used this condition . _",
    "the stefan condition _ is usually employed in the analysis of hydrofracturing in its implicit form as a compatibility condition ( e.g. @xcite ) and has been defined in an explicit way for the steady state problems @xcite .",
    "kemp s condition has recently been rediscovered by linkov @xcite and called by him _",
    "the speed equation_. in our analysis , we shall use both names , the _ stefan condition _ and the _ speed equation _",
    ", interchangeably .",
    "the recalled condition has the following form in the 1d formulation :    @xmath67    where the left - hand side of ( [ se ] ) is the speed of the fracture tip , while the right - hand side is the fluid front velocity .",
    "equation ( [ se ] ) is valid under the assumption that the fluid front coincides with the fracture tip .",
    "this implies that there is no lag between them .",
    "also the invasive zone ahead of the crack ( the area ahead of the fracture tip penetrated by fluid ) and , in some cases , the carter leak - off should be excluded from consideration . in those three aforementioned cases",
    ", the speed equation ( [ se ] ) can be still utilised by supplementing the right hand - side with an additional term which takes into account the respective phenomenon ( lag , invasive zone , severe leak - off ) .",
    "as an additional argument to justify the speed equation ( [ se ] ) , one can examine a possible behaviour of the leak - off function @xmath17 near the crack tip .",
    "note that @xmath17 in ( [ continuos_1 ] ) describes the rate of fluid flow from the fracture into the surrounding formation , and generally is not known in advance . to describe this phenomenon",
    ", one needs to formulate a coupled problem linking the processes within the fracture to those in the rock formation which depends on various external conditions ( geometry , porosity , permeability , fluid saturation and others ) .",
    "this nonlocal formulation complicates the problem enormously .",
    "the usual way to overcome this difficulty is to treat the function @xmath68 as given one ( which anyway can be dependent on the processes within the fracture by the known relation through the crack opening , the net pressure and the properties of the adherent rock ) . only in the case of impermeable",
    "rock the problem of hydraulic fracture simplifies in this respect and one can set @xmath69 .    in the _ local empirical _ formulation",
    ", the leak - off function is assumed to be solution dependent relation .",
    "we assume the following behaviour of @xmath17 near the crack tip : @xmath70 where @xmath71 .",
    "note that @xmath72 corresponds to the classic empirical carter law @xcite .",
    "it is well known ( see for example @xcite ) that the leading term of the crack opening asymptotic expansion in the near - tip region can be expressed as : @xmath73 and it does not depend on the value of @xmath74 ( @xmath75 is to be found as an element of the solution ) . here , the constant @xmath76 depends only on the particular elasticity operator for the problem and the crack propagation regime @xcite ( see table [ t1 ] )",
    "however , further terms of the asymptotics of the crack opening and other dependent variables depend essentially on the behaviour of the leak - off function near the crack tip and play a crucial role in the analysis as they determine the smoothness of the particle velocity function in the vicinity of the fracture front .",
    "let us then discuss the possible behavior of the function @xmath17 , taking into account one of the basic assumptions used when deriving the lubrication equation . namely , it is assumed that the fluid flow inside a thin channel is predominantly directed along the channel walls .",
    "indeed , the assumption used when deriving the lubrication approximation is that there is no pressure gradient normal to wall . as a result ,",
    "the flow in this direction vanishes ( e.g @xcite ) .",
    "this , in turn , implies that @xmath77 at any point along the crack surfaces including the fracture tip . on the other hand",
    ", the fluid flux near the crack tip behaves similarly to the that of the crack opening ( since the particle velocity is finite at the crack tip ) . as a result",
    ", the following condition should be accepted : @xmath78 throughout this paper we assume that the condition ( [ leak_off_assumption ] ) holds true in its stronger version : @xmath79 this condition is equivalent to the speed equation in the form ( [ se ] ) , as it follows immediately from the continuity equation ( [ continuos_1 ] ) .",
    "the assumption ( [ leak_off_assumption_strong ] ) fails when one considers the toughness driven kgd model ( @xmath80 ) with the classical carter law ( @xmath72 ) . in this particular case",
    ", an additional term @xmath81 should be introduced in the right - hand side of ( [ se ] ) to guarantee its validity as one can easily check by substituting ( [ as_opening ] ) and ( [ q_l ] ) into ( [ continuos_1 ] ) for @xmath82 . here",
    "@xmath83 is a known function or a functional defined on the solution @xmath84(t)$ ] .",
    "however , in the case of the fluid driven kgd model ( @xmath72 , @xmath85 ) , failure to comply with condition results in an infinite value of the crack propagation speed ( in this case , many authors tend to accept the validity of the carter law only at some distance from the fracture tip - see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the authors believe that the empirical carter law loses its physical sense at the crack tip .",
    "for example , we showed in @xcite that for the pkn model a perturbation of the law in a very small region near the fracture front ( at a distance less than @xmath86 of the crack length ) produces a change in the fracture length , which amounts to a few percent .",
    "in other words , a change in the law over a distance less than @xmath87 mm would result in the deviation of the crack length greater than @xmath87 m , which is unrealistic .    in the following",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case ( [ q_l ] ) with assumption ( [ leak_off_assumption_strong ] ) , and consequently with the speed equation in the form ( [ se ] ) . the latter will be used throughout this paper to trace the fracture front . on the other hand , the _ speed equation _ serves as the boundary condition at the crack tip for the dependent variable , which is now the particle velocity , @xmath51 , not the fluid flux as in the standard approach .",
    "the advantages of such an approach have already been shown in @xcite .",
    "let us normalize the problem by introducing the following dimensionless variables : @xmath88 @xmath89 where @xmath90 $ ] , and parameter @xmath91 takes value either 1 or 2 for the pkn and kgd model , respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath92 coincides with the order of homogeneity of the operator @xmath93 .",
    "parameter @xmath94 is to be chosen as convenient .",
    "note that the normalization is not attributed to any particular influx regime , elasticity operator or asymptotic behaviour of the solution .    in the normalized variables ,",
    "the continuity equation takes the form : @xmath95 where the fluid flow rate was replaced by the product of the crack opening and the particle velocity according to .",
    "the normalized particle velocity yields : @xmath96 and the speed equation transforms now to : @xmath97_{\\tilde x=1}.\\ ] ] the normalized elasticity equation takes the form : @xmath98 where an identity operator , @xmath99 corresponds to the pkn model , while the integral operators for the kgd model are @xmath100 and @xmath101 for equations and , respectively . in our computations we shall use an alternative form of obtained using integration by parts : @xmath102 where the kernel @xmath103 is : @xmath104 and @xmath105 stands for the dimensionless toughness . consequently , the asymptotic estimate can be now rewritten in the form : @xmath106 from definition one can determine the dimensionless toughness as : @xmath107    the boundary conditions  are converted to : @xmath108    the initial conditions are now : @xmath109.\\ ] ]    the transformation of the global fluid balance equation gives : @xmath110d \\tilde x-\\int_0^{\\tilde t}\\tilde q_0(\\tilde t)d\\tilde t+\\int_0^{\\tilde t}l(\\tilde t)\\int_0 ^ 1 \\tilde q_l(\\tilde t,\\tilde x)d \\tilde x d\\tilde t=0,\\ ] ] note that relation is valid under the assumption that the process of hydraulic fracturing is monotonous ( @xmath111 ) .    remark 1 .",
    "note that the normalized boundary conditions ( compare @xmath112 , ) @xmath113 are satisfied automatically and no longer need to be enforced .",
    "however , when appropriate , they can be implemented in the code .    for simplicity ,",
    "from now on , we omit the `` @xmath114 '' symbol for all normalized variables and parameters , and consider respective dimensionless values only .",
    "in @xcite it was demonstrated that , in order to utilize the speed equation ( [ se_n ] ) efficiently , one needs to properly employ the tip asymptotics .",
    "this is the key point of the proposed method : such an approach makes it possible to evaluate the crack propagation speed without the technical difficulties discussed in @xcite and uncertainties related to dividing two infinitesimally small values near the crack tip ( the fluid flow rate and the crack opening ) .",
    "we shall show that there is a unique relationship between the crack length and the multipliers of one ( or two ) leading term(s ) of the solution s tip asymptotics .",
    "this relationship has a universal form and can be used regardless of the elasticity operator or crack propagation regime .",
    "the analysis presented below is nothing but a direct extension ( for the kgd model ) of the approach introduced and verified in @xcite .",
    "it has been proved that the crack aperture in the vicinity of the fracture tip can be expressed as ( see @xcite and the references therein , where most of the information can be found for at least the two leading terms ) : @xmath115 where powers @xmath116 are given in table  [ t1 ] for the respective hydraulic fracture models . in the case of non - local elasticity , it is more convenient to base the asymptotic representation on terms @xmath117 . for the pkn and",

    "in this paper the classic problem of hydraulic fracture , considered in its general form , has been revisited and reformulated in terms of a new pair of the dependent variables , with both having a clear physical sense : the crack opening , @xmath29 , and _ * the reduced particle velocity * _ , @xmath126 .",
    "the latter is directly related to the average ( over the fracture cross section ) speed of fluid flow .",
    "it was shown that the new formulation is mathematically complete and well defined .",
    "in particular , _ * unified equation , ( [ v_0_univ ] ) , directly relating the crack propagation speed to the asymptotics of the crack opening * _ were evaluated , using the speed equation , for various elasticity operators and fracture propagation regimes .",
    "self - similar formulations of the problem for different hydraulic fracture models have been given . in this",
    "setting , a universal algorithm for the computational simulation of hydraulic fracture has been developed .",
    "it enables one to account for various elasticity operators , fluid flow and fracture propagation regimes within the framework of a unified scheme .",
    "the proposed algorithm has a modular architecture and consists of two basic modules :    * the first one , a _ universal _",
    "one , computes the reduced particle velocity , and is the same regardless of the variant of the problem under consideration , * the second one , evaluating the crack opening , should be adjusted depending on which elasticity operator is used . in order to account for a specific crack propagation ( fluid / toughness driven ) regime , one only needs to adjust the values of the respective parameters which describe the asymptotics of the crack opening and the reduced velocity near the crack tip .",
    "thus , preliminary knowledge of asymptotic behaviour of the solution is crucial .",
    "the crack propagation speed is computed using respective explicit formula , ( [ v_0_univ ] ) , derived from the speed equation with utilization of the solvability condition ( the fluid balance equation ) providing _ * the explicit formula , ( [ l_int_pkn ] ) , linking the crack length to the tip asymptotics of the crack opening*_.    various numerical techniques are utilized in the proposed method with the reduced particle velocity as the main component .",
    "the key points of the algorithm are : ( i ) proper handling of the independent variables ( appropriate spatial and temporal meshing ) , ( ii ) relevant regularization techniques , in particular the so - called @xmath132-regularization and operator regularization of the governing equations , taking the solvability condition into account when necessary , ( iii ) explicit formula for the crack propagation speed for the fracture front tracing , ( iv ) rigorous utilization of the solution tip asymptotics , ( v ) improved approximation of the temporal derivative of the crack opening .",
    "extensive analysis of performance of the algorithm , for both its self - similar and the general time - dependent formulations , has been done and comparison made with analytical benchmark solutions developed for various models of hydraulic fracture . some of them were adopted from the authors previous papers , while others ( kgd models ) are discussed in appendix b. also , reference solutions available in the literature have been used.the following conclusions can be drawn :    * the algorithm is numerically stable regardless of the hydraulic fracture model used ; * the accuracy of produced results is appreciably better than that of other solutions available in the literature ; * in most cases the computational cost is very low . a properly distributed spatial mesh composed of several dozen of points",
    "provides accuracy better than 0.1@xmath253 .",
    "only the case of very small toughness may necessitate finer meshing .    to summarize , _ * the particle velocity based universal algorithm * _ developed in this paper is capable of tackling various hydraulic fracturing models under different crack propagation regimes .",
    "its flexibility is a result of its adaptive character and modular code architecture .",
    "the method of tracing the fracture front , based on the speed equation , is stable and accurate .",
    "the key issue related to its realization is application of the explicit formulae for the crack propagation speed and the solution tip asymptotics , together with resulting formulae for the crack length .",
    "it was shown that the new algorithm is more accurate than any other available in the literature .    additionally , taking advantage of the algorithm s accuracy , semi - analytic formulae for solving the kgd model in the fluid driven regime",
    "have been evaluated , with a solution which yields all necessary components : the crack opening , @xmath29 , the particle velocity , @xmath51 , the fluid pressure , @xmath259 ( the fluid flux should be computed as @xmath82 ) .",
    "although we restrict ourselves in this paper only to the newtonian fluids , the algorithm may be easily adapted to other rheological models .",
