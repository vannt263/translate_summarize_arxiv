    "novae occur in binary systems in which a roche lobe filling secondary is losing hydrogen - rich material through the inner lagrangian point onto a white dwarf ( wd ) primary .",
    "mass transfer can also occur in long period systems if the secondary has a significant wind , _",
    "e.g. _ the giant secondary in rs oph or v407 cyg . core material is mixed into the accreted material and is violently ejected into space when the pressure at the wd - accretion interface becomes great enough to initiate a thermonuclear runaway ( tnr ) .",
    "novae eject , into the interstellar medium ( ism ) , a mixture of material accreted from the companion star , highly processed material from the underlying wd , and products of nucleosynthesis occurring during the tnr . as a result of the tnr , up to 10@xmath1 m@xmath2 of material",
    "can be ejected from the wd enriched in c , n , o , ne , mg , al and other species @xcite at @xmath3 km s@xmath4 .",
    "any remaining hydrogen still bound to the wd continues to burn in hydrostatic equilibrium until it is consumed or ejected via a wind .",
    "initially , the radiative output of a nova occurs in the optical but as the photosphere of the wd recedes , the spectral energy distribution shifts to higher energies .",
    "the rate of the optical decline defines a nova s primary characteristics ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , namely the time to decline 2 magnitudes from visual maximum , t@xmath0 .",
    "the decline rate depends on the amount of mass ejected , its velocity , composition , and if it runs into circumbinary material .",
    "the bolometric luminosity during the outburst is high , near or exceeding the eddington limit ( for the fastest novae ) , and thus additional material is ejected via a strong stellar wind @xcite . in some novae",
    "the collision between this fast wind and the initial exploded mass or any pre - existing circumbinary material can produce x - ray emission from shocks .",
    "the emission from this early x - ray phase is hard , has a low luminosity , of order 10@xmath5 erg s@xmath4 , and declines relatively rapidly @xcite .",
    "as fuel continues to burn , mass loss causes the photosphere of the wd to shrink @xcite .",
    "the effective temperature increases , peaking in the soft x - rays , at ( 2 - 8)@xmath610@xmath7 k @xcite .",
    "once the ejecta have cleared sufficiently , and if the line of sight extinction is not severe , some novae exhibit characteristics similar to the super soft x - ray binary sources with strong and soft , e@xmath8 @xmath9 1 kev , x - ray emission .",
    "this point in novae evolution is called the sss phase . at low spectral resolution ,",
    "the uv / x - ray spectral energy distributions ( sed ) resembles blackbodies , but higher resolution _",
    "chandra _  or _ xmm _  grating observations reveal a significantly more complex picture .",
    "the spectra frequently have p - cygni profiles or emission lines superimposed on a line blanketed atmosphere .",
    "models sophisticated enough to interpret the high resolution data are only now becoming available @xcite . once nuclear burning ends , the x - ray light curve rapidly declines as the wd cools marking the end of the sss phase and the outburst .",
    "at some point mass transfer resumes and eventually another eruption occurs .",
    "these are called classical novae ( cne ) until a second outburst is observed then they become recurrent novae ( rne ) .",
    "detailed reviews of nova evolution are presented by @xcite and @xcite . @xcite",
    "discuss the theoretical implications of x - ray observations of novae while @xcite discusses the current understanding of the rn class .",
    "an important , but not the sole driver of the nova phenomenon is the mass of the wd .",
    "explosions on larger mass wds expel less mass but at higher velocities .",
    "they have larger luminosities , are in outburst for less time , and ( should ) have shorter recurrence times than novae on lower mass wds .",
    "high mass ( @xmath10 1.25 m@xmath2 ) wds reach tnr ignition more rapidly than low mass wds and thus do not have the chance to accrete as much material .",
    "they also reach higher peak temperatures during the tnr leading to a more energetic explosion .",
    "however , other factors are believed to play important roles leading to a nova event .",
    "these include the composition of the wd , either co or one , the initial temperature of the wd during accretion , the mass accretion rate @xcite , the composition of the accreted material @xcite , and the mixing history of the core / envelope .",
    "all impact how much mass can be transfered to the wd before an outburst begins .",
    "models show that different combinations of these characteristics can reproduce a wide range of nova outbursts @xcite .",
    "unfortunately very few of these parameters have been observationally verified in any nova .",
    "the x - ray regime is a crucial component for the study of novae providing insight into tnr burning processes , wd mass and composition , accretion and mixing mechanisms , dust grain formation and destruction , and mass loss processes .",
    "in addition , high mass novae such as rne are potential sn ia progenitors via the single degenerate scenario . to make progress understanding the physics of these important astrophysical phenomena , observations of a large number of novae are required to sample all the contributing factors .",
    "prior to the launch of _ swift _  the general x - ray temporal evolution of novae was far from complete as only a few novae had been observed at more than one epoch in x - rays .",
    "_ swift _  is an excellent facility for studying novae as it has a superb soft x - ray response with its xrt instrument @xcite .",
    "@xcite show how the xrt favorably compares with currently available x - ray instruments .",
    "_ swift _  also has a co - aligned uv / optical instrument , uvot ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) , which provides either 6 filter photometry or low resolution grism spectroscopy .",
    "the other _ swift _  instrument is a @xmath11-ray detector , bat .",
    "however , novae are generally not strong @xmath11-ray sources @xcite .",
    "the decay of @xmath12na ( half - life 2.6 yrs ) generates a 1275 kev emission line but only @xmath10 1.25 m@xmath2 wds are predicted to produce sufficient @xmath12na during the tnr .",
    "this line has not yet been definitively detected by satellites @xcite but there is a recent claim by @xcite that their models with compton decay of @xmath12na can account for the hard x - ray flux in v2491 cyg provided an exceptionally large amount of @xmath12na , 3@xmath610@xmath13m@xmath2 , was synthesized .",
    "another @xmath11-ray emission mechanism is electron - positron annihilation very early in the outburst but this is expected to be detectable only in nearby novae .",
    "the symbiotic rn rs oph , at 1.6 kpc , was clearly detected in the lowest energy channels of the _",
    "swift_/bat , but that emission is consistent with that from high temperature shocks as the outburst ejecta plow into the pre - existing red giant wind . recently the symbiotic rn v407 cyg was detected in the gev band by _ fermi - lat _",
    "@xcite only a few days after visual maximum .",
    "@xcite show that the @xmath11-ray emission can be explained by either compton scattering of infrared photons in the red giant wind or @xmath14 decay from proton - proton collisions .",
    "@xcite predict that @xmath14 @xmath11-rays will be created in the high circumbinary densities of very long orbital periods systems such as v407 cyg , with a period of @xmath15 43 years @xcite .",
    "_ swift _  has a rapid response too procedure and flexible scheduling which is critical in obtaining well sampled x - ray light curves of transient events . initial _ swift _",
    "results of 11 novae were presented in @xcite . since that time significantly",
    "more data have been obtained by the _ swift _",

    "expansion velocities provide another way to classify a nova since more massive wds eject less mass and at a greater velocity than low mass wds .",
    "this characteristic can be preferable to t@xmath0 since the rate of decline can be difficult to determine for novae with secondary maxima , dust formation , or that have poorly sampled early light curves .",
    "both fwhm and t@xmath0 are used as simple proxies for the wd mass .",
    "the n@xmath18 values were obtained from the heasarc n@xmath18 tool using the averaged lab and dl maps within a 0.5@xmath42 area around each nova .",
    "figure [ t2vsfwhm ] shows the t@xmath0 and fwhm distribution for all the novae with both values .",

    "the dusty novae are scattered throughout the fwhm - t@xmath0 phase space showing no particular preference for any type of nova .",
    "figure [ t2vsfwhm ] also shows that there is a wide dispersion between fwhm and t@xmath0 , e.g. novae with t@xmath0 of 10 days have fwhm values between 1000 and 3000 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the top panel of figure [ t2vsfwhm ] shows the distribution of t@xmath0 in one day bins . using the light curve classifications of @xcite , the sample",
    "is heavily weighted toward very fast ( t@xmath0 @xmath9 10 days ) and fast ( 11 @xmath10 t@xmath0 @xmath9 25 days ) novae .",
    "these are intrinsically more luminous , with a larger rise from quiescence to maximum light .",
    "the peak is at 8 days and with a median t@xmath0 of 9 days .",
    "there are only 5 novae in the entire sample with t@xmath0 times greater than 50 days , i m nor , lmc 2005 , qy mus , v723 cas , and v5558 sgr .",
    "the far right panel in figure [ t2vsfwhm ] gives the distribution for fwhm in 500 km s@xmath4 bins .",
    "the majority of the novae in the sample have low expansion velocities with the peak in the 1500 - 2000 km s@xmath4 bin .",
    "the median fwhm is 1800 km s@xmath4 .",
    "there are only 5 novae with fwhm @xmath43 4000 km s@xmath4 in the sample and all but v4643 sgr are rne or suspected rne .",
    "the x - ray sample is biased toward fast novae for multiple reasons .",
    "the bulk of the observations are from _ swift _ , and _ swift _",
    "has only been operational for 5 years .",
    "fast systems , like the rn rs oph will rise and fall on time - scales of months ( see section [ var ] ) while slow novae , such as v1280 sco , have not yet had sufficient time to evolve into soft x - ray sources ( and may not ) thus are therefore underrepresented .",
    "slow novae also require more observing time to be monitored over their lifetime , particularly if the same coverage of the x - ray evolution is desired .",
    "allocations of _ swift _  observing time over multiple cycles are difficult to justify and execute unless a compelling scientific rationale is forthcoming , such as unusual or significant spectral variations ( see section [ fex ] ) , count rate oscillations , abundance pattern changes , etc .",
    "slow and old novae ( many tens of months post - outburst ) are generally sampled once a year in part due to their slow evolution .",
    "however , the main reason the sample depicted in fig . [ t2vsfwhm ] favors fast novae is due to the strong selection effect toward outbursts on high mass wds . while high mass wds , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath43 1.2 m@xmath2 , are relatively rare in the field , the time - scale between outbursts is significantly shorter than for low - mass wds , meaning they dominate any observational sample @xcite . finally , high mass wds give rise to more luminous outbursts and the _ swift _  nova - cv group has a v @xmath9 8 magnitude selection criterion which leads to preferentially selecting brighter sources .",
    "figure [ dusthistogram ] shows the distribution of our sample ( table [ chartable ] ) with respect to dust formation frequency .",
    "only @xmath15 16% of the novae in the sample had clear indications in the literature of dust formation in the ejecta .",
    "the dust formation frequency increases to 31% when including the 7 novae where dust likely formed based on characteristics of the visual light curve but not yet confirmed by a measured sed excess in the thermal- and mid - infrared , _",
    "e.g. _ the `` maybe ' 's in column 10 of table [ chartable ] .",
    "this is consistent with the expectations of the general population of dusty novae which ranges from 18% to @xmath44% .",
    "the lower limit is set by @xcite who find that 93 well sampled american association of variable star observers ( aavso ) novae have the large dip in their visual light curves indicative of strong dust formation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the upper limit is from a recent _ spitzer _ survey of ir bright novae that finds many novae have weak dust emission signatures with little or no dip in the visual light curve especially at late epochs ( many 100s of days post - outburst ) when emission from the dust envelope is a few @xmath45jy @xcite    in order to obtain the best x - ray and uv data , it is desirable to target novae with low extinction along the line of sight .",
    "however , determining the extinction early in the outburst is challenging .",
    "n@xmath18 maps are crude since they sample large regions of the sky .",
    "the region size used to derive the n@xmath18 values in table [ chartable ] was 0.5@xmath46 .",
    "typically just a handful of sight lines are available in regions of this relatively small size .",
    "the problem is exacerbated in inhomogeneous areas like the galactic plane where most novae are found .",
    "the extinction maps of @xcite can be used to obtain e(b - v ) since their spatial resolution is significantly higher .",
    "however , the @xcite maps suffer from large errors in the galactic plane , @xmath47 5@xmath46 .",
    "maps also give the total galactic line of sight with no information versus distance and thus provide only an upper limit .",
    "e(b - v ) can also be determined from indirect methods but these require either high resolution spectroscopy to measure ism absorption lines ( _ e.g. _  d @xmath485890 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the line strengths of optical and near - ir spectroscopy of lines @xcite , or extensive b and v photometry during the early outburst .",
    "finally , e(b - v ) estimates can be affected by other factors occurring during the outburst such as dust formation or intrinsic absorption from the ejecta while the expanding material is still dense .",
    "it is therefore desirable to check that the general relationship between n@xmath18 and e(b - v ) holds for novae .",
    "figure [ ebmvnh ] shows n@xmath18 versus e(b - v ) for the novae in this paper with the dotted line showing the average milky way extinction law , e(b - v ) = n@xmath18/4.8@xmath610@xmath49 @xcite , as the dotted line .",
    "the circles represent novae with galactic latitudes , @xmath50 5@xmath46 while pluses are novae found within the disk , @xmath47 5@xmath46 .",

    "this light curve evolution was expected as the obscuration from the ejecta clears and the effective temperature of the wd photosphere increases @xcite .",

    "the first x - ray observation of v4633 sgr was obtained 934 days after visual maximum but it and subsequent observations were of a hard source implying that any sss emission was missed . with an upper limit of 2.5 years for its sss emission , v4633 sgr can not be considered a long - lived sss nova based on the distribution shown in figure [ histogram]a .",

    "the later `` excessive '' x - ray luminosities of @xcite were derived from blackbody fits which are known to predict higher luminosities than model atmospheres fit to the same data .",

    "of the 4 novae with supporting x - ray observations , only gq mus fully matches the criteria of a long lasting sss on a magnetic wd in a short period system .    with our expanded x - ray sample",
    "there are 3 additional novae with well constrained sss durations that can potentially be used to test the hypothesis .",
    "v4743 sgr @xcite , v597 pup @xcite , and v2467 cyg @xcite are ip candidates and thus believed to have strong magnetic fields .",

    "thus the data available do not imply that short orbital period or strong magnetic fields produce significantly longer sss than the average novae from our sample .",
    "an interesting question is why there is no trend between orbital period and sss duration as the underlying assumption of enhanced accretion due to heating of the secondary is sound .",
    "one reason would be that there is no significant enhancement in the mass transfer rate from the illuminated secondary , perhaps from shielding due to a thick disk .",
    "another possibility is that there is an effect but it is subtle and affected by other variables such as the strength of the magnetic field , composition of the accreted material , wd mass , etc .",

    "more observations of novae with different characteristics are required in order to understand the underlying physics .",
    "the creation , evolution , and eventual destruction of dust occurs on relatively rapid time - scales in novae making them excellent objects for understanding dust grain formation .",

    "a correlation of the recent _ spitzer _ spectroscopic observations of dusty novae ( see * ? ? ?",

    "grain formation inside dense clumps also explains the higher frequency of dust in slow novae ( see table 13.1 in * ? ? ?",

    "xmm _  observations .",
    "the dust likely formed in the later extraordinary mass ejection event that produced the large secondary peak in the light curve and increased ejection velocities .",
    "the additional material would have absorbed the soft x - ray emission and delayed the onset of any sss phase . in the last _ xmm _  observation it was extremely faint indicating that if there was a sss phase it was over by 990 days after maximum .",
    "v1280 sco was detected as an x - ray source late in its outburst but the x - rays were relatively hard and faint @xcite .",
    "v1280 sco has yet to be observed as an sss and its internal extinction is still large . in both v2362 cyg and v1280 sco , grain growth was likely enhanced to produce the large dust events due to the effective shielding of the large mass ejections .      at the maximum effective temperature , ( 2 - 8)@xmath610@xmath7 k , the bulk of the emission in a nova outburst comes from x - rays which are primarily soft .",
    "assuming the external column is low enough and the effective temperature is suitably high enough , this x - ray emission can be detected .",
    "the theory of constant bolometric luminosity predicts that at x - ray maximum the light curve should be relatively constant since one is observing the majority of the emitted flux .",

    "however , the expected x - ray plateau in all well studied _ swift _",
    "novae has been far from constant .",
    "in addition , the rise to x - ray maximum also shows large amplitude oscillations .",
    "what is the source of the variability during both phases ?",
    "one important caveat",
    "when discussing the _ swift _  data is that the xrt count rate is not a direct measure of the bolometric flux , only the portion that is emitted between 0.3 and 10 kev . during the sss phase the vast majority of photons",

    "there is evidence for this at other wavelengths .",
    "for example , a sudden absorption component that appeared in the balmer lines of v2214 oph in july 1988 was interpreted by @xcite as the passage of an absorbing clump in front of the the emitting region .",
    "both types of absorption changes should be manifest as a hardening of the x - ray spectrum or increase in the hardness ratio with increasing soft flux emission consistent with the counter examples of @xcite .",
    "as a test of the neutral absorption theory we use the model results from a recent photoionization analyses in webpimms to determine the count rates and hardness ratios for different column densities and simulate the effect of clumps .",

    "the effect should be greater in slower novae with more ejected mass such as v458 vul .",
    "in addition , @xcite find that in rs oph the ratio of high flux states to low flux states as a function of energy is not consistent with either type of variable visibility of the wd .",

    "the source remains x - ray faint until the wd photosphere shrinks back to its original size .",
    "figure [ v458vullc ] shows similar behavior in the _ swift _  x - ray and uv light curves of v458 vul compiled from the data in table 2 .",
    "the 100@xmath6 decline in the x - ray light curve is matched by a 1.5 magnitude increase in the uv light curve .",
    "figure [ xrtevol ] shows that similar x - ray and uv variations can be achieved by large declines in the effective temperature .",
    "for example , a decline from 700,000 k to 500,000 k produces a factor of 85 decline in the x - ray count rate and a 1.1 magnitude @xmath92 band increase .",
    "if the underlying phenomenon in v458 vul is the same as proposed for rx j0513.9 - 6951 and cal 83 and the accretion disk has been reestablished , v458 vul should have an orbital period of order one day to produce an accretion rate high enough to drive stable nuclear burning .",
    "however , @xcite find a short orbital period of @xmath15 98 minutes implying that v458 vul will not have a long term sss phase .",
    "the variability of novae also raises questions about how confident one can be in the determination of turn - off times .",
    "a prime example can be seen in the x - ray light curve of v458 vul in figure [ v458vullc ] . if monitoring had stopped following the four observations between days 450 and 480 the subsequent recovery would never have been found , and it would have been noted that v458 vul had a turn - off time of 1.2 years instead of @xmath84 2.9 years . while this could be a significant problem with the determination of a turn - off time in most novae , it is likely that the phenomenon observed in v458 vul is rare . the x - ray behavior of v458 vul , a 100@xmath6 decline in flux and a subsequent recovery , is the _ only _ case observed in the 19   novae studied by _",

    "since the sudden x - ray declines in v458 vul also had corresponding uv rises , if these source exist in m31 , they should be easily found with x - ray and uv capable facilities such as _ swift _  and _",

    "figure 17.1 and 17.2 show that the optical plateaus are nearly coincident with the sss emission in rs oph and u sco .",
    "the other well observed rne in the _ swift _  archive are novae lmc 2009a and v407 cyg .",
    "lmc 2009a was previously seen in outburst in 1971 @xcite .",
    "it had a much longer sss phase than rs oph and u sco and it ended 270 days after maximum .",
    "unfortunately , the v band light curve compiled from the aavso archives and our own smarts photometry does not extend beyond 110 days after visual maximum so we can not determine whether an optical plateau was observed later in this outburst , see figure 17.3 .",
    "however , the _ swift _",
    "uvw2 and smarts b band light curves are relatively flat during the sss phase ( see bode et al",

    "the data are not as extensive for v407 cyg but the rise in the soft x - ray emission consistent with nuclear burning on the wd ( see section [ v407cygsss ] ) is coincident with a short plateau in the optical light curve as shown in figure 17.4 .",
    "there are three other novae with well observed sss phases in the _ swift_archive that are suspected to be rne based on their outburst characteristics .",
    "the novae are v2491 cyg , kt eri , and v2672 oph .",
    "figure 17.5 shows that there is no indication of a plateau in v2491 cyg while it was a sss . however , the sss phase in v2491 cyg was extremely short , @xmath910 days , which may not be sufficient time to produce a noticeable optical plateau or the system did not have its accretion disk reform this early in the outburst .",
    "the early outburst spectra of kt eri were indicative of the he / n class with high expansion velocities typical of rne @xcite .",
    "kt eri also had short x - ray light curve modulation similar to rs oph , see section [ sssperiods ] and @xcite , while bode et al .",
    "( 2011 , in prep ) draw attention to kt eri s similarities with the x - ray behavior of lmc 2009a .",
    "the x - ray and v band observations are shown in figure 17.6 .",
    "the aavso v band light curve shows a flattening at 80 days after visual maximum or about 10 days after kt eri became a sss implying there was an optical plateau .    the case for v2672 oph as a rne is based on its extreme expansion velocities at maximum @xcite and early radio synchrotron emission similar to that observed in rs oph @xcite .",
    "@xcite also find many similarities between v2672 oph and u sco .",
    "unfortunately , the x - ray and optical observations were hampered due to the faintness at visual maximum and the relatively large column density .",

    "the aavso v band light curve is supplemented with smarts v band photometry which shows a plateau between day 10 through 50 after visual maximum .    of the 4 known rne and 3 suspected rne , there are sufficient optical data to reveal the presence of a plateau in six . of those six all but v2491 cyg have evidence of an optical plateau correlated with the x - ray sss emission .",
    "however , @xcite finds that not all galactic rne have optical plateaus .",
    "it is interesting to note that if the plateau phase is caused by reradiation off an accretion disk as suggested by @xcite then there is no effect on the presence or strength of the plateau due to the inclination of the system .",
    "one would expect the effect in more face - on systems like rs oph , @xmath93 = 39@xmath94@xmath95 @xcite than in edge - on systems such as u sco , @xmath96 @xcite . regardless of the root cause of optical plateaus ,",
    "their presence can clearly be used as a proxy signature of sss emission .",
    "however , it should be stressed that while optical plateaus likely indicate soft x - ray emission , the start and ending of this phase in the optical light curve does not necessarily correspond to the turn - on and turn - off times in the sss phase .",

    "<S> the _ swift _  grb satellite is an excellent facility for studying novae . </S>",
    "<S> its rapid response time and sensitive x - ray detector provides an unparalleled opportunity to investigate the previously poorly sampled evolution of novae in the x - ray regime . </S>",
    "<S> this paper presents _ swift _  observations of 52galactic / magellanic cloud novae . </S>",
    "<S> we included the xrt ( 0.3 - 10 kev ) x - ray instrument count rates and the uvot ( 1700 - 8000 ) filter photometry . also included in the analysis are the publicly available pointed observations of 10 additional novae the x - ray archives . </S>",
    "<S> this is the largest x - ray sample of galactic / magellanic cloud novae yet assembled and consists of 26  novae with super soft x - ray emission , 19 from _ swift </S>",
    "<S> _   observations . </S>",
    "<S> the data set shows that the faster novae have an early hard x - ray phase that is usually missing in slower novae . </S>",
    "<S> the super soft x - ray phase occurs earlier and does not last as long in fast novae compared to slower novae . </S>",
    "<S> all the _ swift _  novae with sufficient observations show that novae are highly variable with rapid variability and different periodicities . in the majority of cases , </S>",
    "<S> nuclear burning ceases less than 3 years after the outburst begins . </S>",
    "<S> previous relationships , such as the nuclear burning duration vs. t@xmath0 or the expansion velocity of the eject and nuclear burning duration vs. the orbital period , are shown to be poorly correlated with the full sample indicating that additional factors beyond the white dwarf mass and binary separation play important roles in the evolution of a nova outburst . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we confirm two optical phenomena that are correlated with strong , soft x - ray emission which can be used to further increase the efficiency of x - ray campaigns . </S>"
