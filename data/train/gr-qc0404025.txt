    "rapidly rotating neutron stars could be an important source of gravitational wave signals .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed that would cause them to emit quasi - periodic gravitational waves  @xcite .",
    "interferometric gravitational wave detectors are now operating in numerous locations around the world  @xcite , and much work has gone into the development of dedicated search algorithms for these signals .",
    "radio observations can provide the sky location , rotation frequency and spin - down rate of known pulsars , and this knowledge simplifies the analysis .",
    "this was the case for the recent search for a signal from psr  j1939 + 2134  @xcite . when the position and phase evolution of a source are not known , all - sky hierarchical strategies are required , and these have huge computational requirements  @xcite .",
    "here we concentrate on the search for a gravitational wave signal from a known location , but where spin parameters of the rotating neutron star are not well known ( but within a narrow band ) .",
    "sn1987a is a good example of a poorly parameterised source for which the sky location is known , but where there are large uncertainties in the frequency and spin - down parameters of a putative neutron star  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "we consider a search with six unknown parameters : the gravitational wave amplitude @xmath0 , the polarization angle @xmath1 ( which depends on the position angle of the spin axis in the plane of the sky ) , the phase of the signal at a fiducial time @xmath2 , the inclination of the spin axis with respect to the line - of - sight @xmath3 , the uncertainty in the absolute value of the signal frequency @xmath4 , and the frequency derivative @xmath5 .",
    "we use a bayesian markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) technique for this analysis as mcmc methods have been applied successfully to similar problems involving large numbers of parameters @xcite . in a previous study @xcite , we used a metropolis - hastings ( mh ) algorithm @xcite for a similar search , but with only five parameters ( @xmath5 being absent ) . when the frequency derivative @xmath5 is included in the basic mh routine of  @xcite",
    "the large correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath5 makes the parameter search difficult , and the basic mh algorithm becomes inefficient . in order to adequately sample the parameter space we implemented a combination of three different strategies for accelerating convergence of markov chains : reparameterisation , the delayed rejection method of tierney and mira  @xcite ( which is an adaptive version of the mh algorithm ) , and simulated annealing @xcite ( which is a monte carlo approach to global optimization ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath4 is highly correlated with @xmath5 , and a strong correlation also exists between @xmath0 and @xmath6 .",
    "an initial transformation of these variables to near orthogonality yields a more tractable parameter space that is more effectively sampled .",
    "the heterodyne manipulation of the data used in this study is identical to that presented ( by two of us ) in an end - to - end robust bayesian method of searching for periodic signals in gravitational wave interferometer data  @xcite , and is also described in  @xcite . a brief summary of this heterodyne technique is given in sec .",

    "our delayed rejection method , as well as the reparameterisation strategy , is presented in sec .",

    "[ results ] we present the results of this study , using synthesized signals , for this six parameter problem . a brief discussion of the long term goals for this work are presented in sec .  [ disc ]",
    "gravitational waves from spinning neutron stars are expected to be weak at the earth , therefore long integration periods are necessary to extract the signal .",
    "it is therefore important to take proper account of the antenna patterns of the detectors and the doppler shift due to the motion of the earth .    as in previous studies",
    "@xcite we consider the signal expected from a non - precessing triaxial neutron star .",
    "the gravitational wave signal from such an object is at twice its rotation frequency , @xmath7 , and we characterise the amplitudes of each polarization with overall strain factor , @xmath0 .",
    "the measured gravitational wave signal will also depend on the antenna patterns of the detector for the ` cross ' and ` plus ' polarisations , @xmath8 , giving a signal @xmath9 a simple slowdown model provides the phase evolution of the signal as @xmath10 , \\label{phase1}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 here , @xmath12 is the time of arrival of the signal at the solar system barycenter , @xmath13 is the phase of the signal at a fiducial time @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the position of the detector with respect to the solar system barycenter , @xmath16 is a unit vector in the direction of the neutron star , @xmath17 is the speed of light , and @xmath18 contains the relativistic corrections to the arrival time @xcite .",
    "if @xmath19 and @xmath20 are known from ( for example ) radio observations , the signal can be _ heterodyned _ by multiplying the data by @xmath21 $ ] , low - pass filtered and resampled , so that the only time varying quantity remaining is the antenna pattern of the interferometer .",
    "we are left with a simple model with four unknown parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath13 and @xmath3 .",
    "if there is an uncertainty in the frequency and frequency derivative then we have two additional parameters , the differences between the signal and heterodyne frequency and frequency derivatives , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , giving a total of six unknown parameters .",
    "a detailed description of the heterodyning procedure is presented elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "here we just provide a brief summary of this standard technique .",
    "the raw signal , @xmath22 , is centered near twice the rotation frequency of the neutron star , but is doppler modulated due to the motion of the earth and the orbit of the neutron star if it is in a binary system .",
    "the modulation bandwidth is typically @xmath23 times less than the detector bandwidth , so one can greatly reduce the effective data rate by extracting this band and shifting it to zero frequency . in its standard form",
    "the result is one binned data point , @xmath24 , every minute , containing all the relevant information from the original time series but at only @xmath25 the original data rate .",
    "if the phase evolution has been correctly accounted for at this heterodyning stage then the only time - varying component left in the signal will be the effect of the antenna pattern of the interferometer , as its geometry with respect to the neutron star varies with earth rotation .",
    "any small error , @xmath4 , in the heterodyne frequency will cause the signal to oscillate at @xmath4 ( plus the residual dopper shift ) .",
    "we estimate the noise variance , @xmath26 , in the bin values , @xmath24 , from the sample variance of the contributing data .",
    "it is assumed that the noise is stationary over the 60s of data contributing to each bin .",
    "after heterodyning , the signal on which we wish to carry out our mcmc analysis has the form  @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the time of the @xmath29 bin @xmath30 and @xmath31 is a vector of our unknown parameters .",
    "@xmath32 represents the residual phase evolution of the signal , equalling @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "the objective is to fit this model to the antenna output data @xmath34 where @xmath35 is assumed to be normally distributed noise with a mean of zero and known variance @xmath36 .",
    "assuming exchangeability of the binned data points , @xmath30 , the joint likelihood that these data @xmath37 arise from a model with a certain parameter vector @xmath38 is @xcite @xmath39     = \\exp \\left [ \\frac{-\\chi^2({\\mbox{\\boldmath${a}$}})}{2}\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath40 in order to draw any inference on the unknown parameter vector @xmath38 we need the ( posterior ) probability of @xmath38 given @xmath41 which can be obtained from the likelihood via an application of bayes theorem .",
    "the unnormalized posterior density @xmath42 is the product of the prior density of @xmath38 , @xmath43 , and the joint likelihood .",
    "accordingly , appropriate priors have to be chosen for the particular parameters . in this study",
    "we use uniform priors with prior ranges @xmath44 $ ] , @xmath45 $ ] and @xmath46 $ ] for the angle parameters @xmath2 , @xmath1 and @xmath47 respectively . for @xmath0 we also specify a uniform prior with boundary @xmath48 $ ] in units of the rms noise @xcite . for the frequency and spindown",
    "uncertainty we use suitable uniform priors with ranges of @xmath49$]hz and @xmath50$]hzs@xmath51 for @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the normalized posterior density @xmath52 can not be evaluated analytically , so we use monte carlo methods to explore @xmath53 .",
    "if we can simulate from @xmath53 , we can estimate all interesting quantities , including the posterior means of all parameters from the corresponding sample means , to any desired accuracy by increasing the sample size .",
    "however , drawing independent samples in a six - dimensional parameter space is not feasible .",
    "it has already been shown that mcmc methods can be used to parameterise gravitational wave signals of low signal - to - noise ratio  @xcite with four unknown parameters .",
    "these simulate a markov chain , constructed so that its stationary distribution coincides with the posterior distribution and the sample path averages converge to the expectations . a minimal requirement for this",
    "is the irreducibility of the chain and hence the ability of the chain to reach all parts of the state space  @xcite .",
    "a specific mcmc technique is the mh algorithm  @xcite which does not require the normalization constant , only the unnormalized posterior density of eq .",
    "( [ eq : post ] ) .",
    "we employed the mh algorithm for the four and five parameter pulsar detection problems  @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of the mh algorithm depends heavily on the choice of the proposal density .",
    "intuition suggests that the closer the proposal distribution is to the target , the faster convergence to stationarity is achieved .",
    "default choices such as a gaussian proposal or a random walk result in very slow mixing for this 6-parameter problem . to increase the speed of convergence",
    ", we employed an _ adaptive _ technique , adaptive in the sense that it allows the choice of proposal distribution to depend upon information gained from the already sampled states as well as the proposed but rejected states .",
    "the idea behind the delayed rejection algorithm specified by  @xcite is that persistent rejection , perhaps in particular parts of the state space , may indicate that locally the proposal distribution is badly calibrated to the target .",
    "therefore , the mh algorithm is modified so that on rejection , a second attempt to move is made with a proposal distribution that depends on the previously rejected state .",
    "this adaptive monte - carlo method  @xcite was generalized for the variable dimension case  @xcite and renamed the ` delayed rejection method ' .",
    "since we have a fixed dimension problem here we implemented the original version  @xcite , and also the generalization  @xcite that uses the reversible jump method .",
    "it turned out that the delayed rejection with the reversible jump method was not that beneficial for this particular problem and thus we will explain the original delayed rejection algorithm  @xcite here .    for the metropolis - hastings algorithm a new state in a markov chain is chosen first by sampling a candidate @xmath54 from a certain proposal distribution @xmath55 usually depending on the current state @xmath56 and then accepting or rejecting it with a probability @xmath57 depending on the distribution of interest .",
    "this rejection is essential for the convergence of the chain to the intended target distribution .",
    "the choice of a good proposal distribution is important to avoid persistent rejections in order to achieve good convergence of a chain .",
    "however in different parts of the state space different proposals are required .",
    "when a proposed mh move is rejected , a second candidate @xmath58 can be sampled with a different proposal distribution @xmath59 that can depend on the previously rejected proposal .",
    "since a rejection suggests a bad fit of the first proposal , a different form of proposal can be advantageous in the second stage .",
    "to preserve reversibility of the markov chain and thus to comply with the detailed balance condition , the acceptance probabilities for both the first and the second stage are given by @xcite @xmath60 and @xmath61}{p({\\mbox{\\boldmath${a}$}}_n)p({\\mbox{\\boldmath$d$}}|{\\mbox{\\boldmath${a}$}}_n ) q_1({\\mbox{\\boldmath${a}$}}'|{\\mbox{\\boldmath${a}$}}_n ) q_2({\\mbox{\\boldmath${a}$}}''|{\\mbox{\\boldmath${a}$}}_n,{\\mbox{\\boldmath${a}$}}')[1-\\alpha_1({\\mbox{\\boldmath${a}$}}'|{\\mbox{\\boldmath${a}$}}_n)]}\\right)\\ ] ] respectively .",
    "[ fig1 ] illustrates the idea of delayed rejection .",
    "when the second stage proposal step is applied due to rejection of the first , the chain has , in order to preserve the reversibility , to imply a return path which comprises a fictive stationary markov chain consisting of a fictive stage 1 proposal step from @xmath62 to @xmath54 which is rejected followed by an accepted fictive second stage move to @xmath56  @xcite .",
    "although the delayed rejection method provides better acceptance rates over the two stages , cross - correlations between the parameters still impede convergence of the markov chain .",
    "preliminary runs reveal that especially the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and to a certain extent @xmath0 and @xmath6 are highly correlated after the markov chain has found a potential mode .",
    "the consequence of which is poor mixing of the chain and therefore a reparameterisation is required .",
    "the coherence between @xmath4 and @xmath5 is obvious since the data is sampled from time @xmath63 to @xmath64 , where the heterodyned signal traverses a frequency from @xmath65 to @xmath66 ; time @xmath67 is an epoch time when @xmath68 .",
    "hence it is much more natural to work with these frequencies as new parameters and vary them with a certain correlation which influences @xmath5 indirectly .",
    "the original parameters are then obtained by the simple linear transformation @xmath69 and @xmath70 since the jacobian of this transformation is constant the prior distributions for the new parameters @xmath71 and @xmath72 are flat as well .    another cross - correlation can be observed between the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath73 that arises from the fact that @xmath0 can be seen as a scaling factor and @xmath6 as a non - linear weighting between the plus and cross polarisation part of the model . as seen in eq .",
    "[ yeq ] , the plus part is multiplied by the factor @xmath74 while the cross part encloses the term @xmath75 .",
    "the original parameters can be derived from @xmath76 and @xmath77 as mentioned above , the prior distribution of the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath78 are chosen uniform with joint probability density function @xmath79 where for this study @xmath80 in units of the rms noise .",
    "this implies a joint prior distribution for the parameters @xmath81 and @xmath82 of the form @xmath83 with jacobian @xmath84 since the jacobian is positive for the above restrictions we can write @xmath85 this joint prior density has the shape shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .     and @xmath82 for a given boundary @xmath86 for the parameter @xmath0,width=356 ]    these reparameterisations result in a fast mixing markov chain but",
    "still , the choice of a suitable proposal distribution is essential .",
    "usually , a multivariate normal distribution is utilized for the proposal distributions @xmath55 and @xmath59 , with means equal to the current state and different variances depending on the stage .",
    "larger variances are chosen for the ` bold ' first stage steps , while smaller variances are more beneficial for the ` timid ' second stage candidates .",
    "the covariance matrix has to comprise the correlation between the parameters @xmath71 and @xmath87 since this correlation indirectly controls the parameter @xmath5 as mentioned above . hence choosing proposals for @xmath71 and @xmath87 with a correlation of @xmath88 would imply no change of @xmath5 because both parameters are changed in the same way while a correlation of @xmath89 would have a great impact on @xmath5 since @xmath71 and @xmath72 are changed completely uncorrelated .",
    "thus the correlation between @xmath71 and @xmath87 has to be treated randomly in order to control @xmath5 .",
    "best results are obtained when a correlation of @xmath89 is chosen with probability @xmath90 for the bold moves of @xmath5 and a correlation of almost @xmath88 otherwise for timid moves of @xmath5 .",
    "the proposals for the parameters @xmath81 and @xmath82 are sampled independently since they represent scaling factors for the plus and cross polarisation part , respectively .",
    "finally we have to consider the correlation between the original parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 which are not reparameterised .",
    "pilot runs show that they are highly correlated .",
    "hence the proposal distribution is adapted accordingly .    unfortunately , the posterior distribution features very narrow modes in a large parameter space that has to be scanned . thus a simple normal distribution is not suitable for a proposal distribution as pilot runs have revealed",
    ", a proposal distribution with long tails and strong narrow mode is required .",
    "this can easily be achieved by generating a random sample between two boundaries @xmath91 and @xmath92 for the standard deviation of the proposal by generating a random weight for the weighted geometric mean of these two boundaries .",
    "hence we sample standard deviations according to @xmath93 where @xmath94 is beta - distributed with parameters @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the resulting proposal distribution is symmetric with very long tails and a strong narrow mode . in order to obtain higher standard deviations for the first stage",
    "the choice of @xmath97 ( with mean @xmath98 ) is adequate while for the second stage @xmath99 ( with mean @xmath100 ) samples smaller standard deviations .",
    "the implementation of the ideas outlined above leads to reasonable acceptance rates and hence to a much better convergence of the markov chain . while during the burn - in period it is mainly the stage 1 candidates that are accepted , the markov chain is driven mainly by stage 2 candidates after the burn - in . but",
    "still , the stationary distribution features many distinct modes that carry the risk of trapping the markov chain .",
    "therefore , we regard the posterior as a canonical distribution @xmath101 \\nonumber \\\\    & \\propto\\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\chi^2({\\mbox{\\boldmath${a}$}})-2\\log \\left [ p({\\mbox{\\boldmath${a}$ } } ) \\right]}{2 } \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\    & \\propto\\exp\\left[-\\beta\\left(\\chi^2({\\mbox{\\boldmath${a}$}})-2\\log\\left[p({\\mbox{\\boldmath${a}$}})\\right]\\right)\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with inverse temperature @xmath102 . during the burn - in period",
    "this inverse temperature can pass through values starting at a low value ( thus high temperature ) and ending up at @xmath103 which coincides with the posterior distribution .",
    "this simulated annealing technique was introduced by metropolis et al .",
    "@xcite and allows scanning of the whole parameter space by permitting larger steps . for the annealing schedule an exponential temperature curve is applied .",
    "for a certain number of iterations @xmath104 , it starts with an inverse temperature @xmath105 until it reaches @xmath103 .",

    "\\frac{1}{2 } , & \\textrm{if } t > t_s ,   \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] depending on the current iteration @xmath107 . since the starting temperature is dependent on the data set which is influenced by the amplitude @xmath0 of the signal it has to be adapted accordingly .",
    "we have synthesized fictitious data , and passed it through our six parameter mcmc routine .",
    "the presentation of results here is similar to that of the four and five parameter study of  @xcite .",
    "the artificial signals were embedded within white and normally distributed noise . the ability of the mcmc algorithm to successfully find the signal and estimate the six parameters was demonstrated , and is presented below .",
    "the artificial signals @xmath22 were synthesized assuming a source at ra @xmath108 and dec @xmath109 , as would be seen by the ligo - hanford interferometer .",
    "the signals were then added to noise ; we assumed a signal at @xmath110hz and a corresponding noise spectral density of at that frequency of @xmath111hz@xmath112 .",
    "the amplitude of the signal used in our test runs was varied in the range @xmath113 to @xmath114 .",
    "the length of the data set corresponded to @xmath115 samples or 10 days of data at a rate of one sample per minute ( which was the rate used for the ligo / geo s1 analysis described in  @xcite ) .    in fig .",

    "for this example the program ran for @xmath122 iterations . for a signal",
    "this large only about @xmath123 iterations were needed for the burn - in , and this data is discarded from the analysis .",
    "short - term correlations in the chain were eliminated by ` thinning ' the remaining terms ; we kept every @xmath124 item in the chain . in this example",
