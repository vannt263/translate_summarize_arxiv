    "the standard model of particle interactions is very successful , and the recent discovery of the higgs boson seals its validity . yet there are unanswered questions which on one side suggest to go `` beyond the standard model '' , perhaps connecting with a theory of quantum gravity , and on the other side beg for an `` explanation '' of the loose conceptual aspects , such as the hierarchy problem or the nature of symmetries . the spectral approach to noncommutative geometry  @xcite provides a framework for the description of the standard model encoding it in a general view of geometry based on an algebraic description .",
    "in particular , the action of a field theory is encoded in such a description , and one can construct a natural action for fermions and bosons based on the spectral properties of the ( generalized ) dirac operator .",
    "such a _ spectral action _ has been introduced in ref .",

    "@xmath8 spectral action_. in the following , in order to distinguish the @xmath9 spectral action from the usual one , we will call the latter the _ cutoff spectral action _ since the main difference lies in the regularization procedure .",

    "renormalizable_. in particular , it is not necessary to have to consider it as an effective theory valid just below the unification scale , and one can safely use it up to the planck scale where the very nature of spacetime changes due to quantum gravitational effects .",

    "the @xmath8 spectral action instead exhibits viable spectral dimensions . for higgs scalars and gauge bosons",
    "the spectral dimensions coincide with the topological one and equal four , while in the gravitational sector the spectral dimension equals two , which implies improved ultraviolet behavior of the gravitational propagators .",
    "the @xmath8 spectral action defines naturally , at the classical level , all dimension four operators , therefore the crucial point is the generation of lower dimensional operators , namely the quadratic higgs term , and the einstein - hilbert term if one considers the standard model coupled to gravity .",
    "it turns out , and this is one of the most interesting aspects of the paper , that these terms are generated by the presence , in the dirac operator , of a term corresponding to the right handed neutrino majorana mass .",
    "it is already known  @xcite that the presence of a term ( or a field ) of this kind is crucial in order to obtain the experimental higgs mass . for the current study",
    ", this term must contain dimensionful constants , and this leads to the introduction of the needed lower dimensional operators in the spectral action .",

    "this can be divergent and generally speaking does not coincide with the spectral action  @xcite .",
    "let us note that doing a rigorous analysis of the heat kernel expansion one does not actually obtain the higgs potential from the heat expansion , i.e.  one does not find a minimum for all natural that equals to 1 at @xmath61 and then rapidly decreases at @xmath62 .",

    "the result is valid for all @xmath66 , in particular in  the low energy \" region @xmath67 where the cutoff spectral action is supposed to work .",
    "therefore , in order to make this model viable it is necessary to add , by hand , to the @xmath68 term , a quadratic term with a large coefficient .",
    "such a term will provide the minimum of the overall potential , while it will lead to the correct higgs vacuum expectation value , which is many order of magnitude smaller than the cutoff scale @xmath26 .",
    "regarding the cosmological constant , let us note that the natural value obtained through the spectral action is @xmath69 , hence much bigger than the observationally known .",
    "hence , one should add by hand the appropriate term to render it compatible with its observational value .",
    "finally it is known , that the coefficient in front of the scalar curvature @xmath34 , that has to be identified with inverse gravitational constant , is ( depending on @xmath26 ) at least one order of magnitude smaller than the value , obtained from experiment , therefore one should also add a corresponding term to the action in order to get the correct value of this coefficient .",
    "thus , we conclude that the magnitude of the _ dimensionful _ parameters appearing in the model , the cosmological constant , the higgs vacuum expectation value and the gravitational coupling have to be put in   by hand with unnatural numerical values which are independent of the cutoff scale .",
    "we emphasize that independently of the choice of the almost - commutative manifold , the physical values of these quantities necessitate an experimental input which goes beyond the data encoded by the spectral triple .",

    "such a renormalization would decrease a little bit the predictive power for curved spacetime , however all particle phenomenology related with the flat spacetime would remain unchanged",
    ". this normalization may be favorable in order to have positively defined expression ( at large momenta ) for the euclidean path integral , therefore for completeness we present also results for running dimension in this case . _    in this situation , the running spectral dimension @xmath116 is real for all @xmath119 , but not just at @xmath121 and @xmath122 , and the corresponding plot is presented in fig  [ figure3 ] .",
    "in this paper we propose a new definition of the bosonic spectral action using the zeta function regularization .",
    "the corresponding theory is local , unitary and renormalizable .",
    "we recall that the mentioned statement concerns fermions and bosons , while quantization of gravity goes beyond the scope of our present study .",
    "such a separation is indeed reasonable ; quantum gravitational effects manifest themselves at energies @xmath123 gev , but nonlocality and nonrenormalizability manifest theirselves at the cutoff scale @xmath124 gev , i.e. at energies _ at least _",
    "100 times less .",
    "the spectral dimensions for fields of various spin are non trivial .    in order to obtain ( in the ultraviolet renormalization ) the higgs quadratic term ,",
    "a term in the dirac operator corresponding to a neutrino majorana mass is fundamental .",
    "a nonzero element in that position in the dirac operator is also necessary to obtain the correct mass of the higgs  @xcite . in this case",
    "the entry is a field a_i^c ( x ) , i=1,2,3  , [ mast ] ( where @xmath125 is a generation index ) and one can consider more general terms ^c ( a_i(x ) + m_i )  , where @xmath126 and @xmath127 are different constants for right - handed neutrinos in different generations , with the condition @xmath128 , for @xmath129 , otherwise a field redefinition could eliminate them .",
    "these terms are allowed by symmetries .",
    "indeed , the only reason of the usage of constant mass terms was the introduction of @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 terms in the action and therefore the corresponding counter terms upon ultraviolet renormalization .",
    "the numerical values of the constants @xmath127 is not relevant , they can be arbitrarily small ( and therefore without phenomenological consequences ) , but they must be nonzero in order to introduce the counterterms needed to renormalize the cosmological constant , the quadratic higgs and the einstein - hilbert terms .",
    "we emphasize , that at the present stage all phenomenological predictions of our approach ( like the prediction of the higgs mass ) are the same as in the ones derived from the cutoff spectral action .",
    "working in the formalism exhibiting both @xmath51 field and the first order condition , e.g.  the grand symmetry framework  @xcite , then the dirac operator only has neutrino majorana mass terms of the kind of and correspondingly no dimension zero and two operators appear in the classical action . in this case",
    "the @xmath8 spectral action reads : & & s_= dx ( _ 1 b_b^ + _ 2 w_^w^ + _ 3 g_^ag^a + _ 4h(-^2-)h .",
    "+ & & .+ _ 5 h^4+_6(-^2-)+ _ 7 ^4 + _ 8 h^2 ^ 2 + _ 9 c_c^ + _ 10r^*r^ * ) , [ sc ] both fermionic and bosonic parts of the spectral action are invariant under local conformal transformations ( x ) e^-(x ) ( x),h(x ) e^-(x ) h(x),(x ) e^-(x ) ( x ) , e^a_e^+(x)e^a _ , and this classical theory does not contain any dimensionful parameters .",
    "since the theory is renormalizable these parameters will not appear in the renormalization process .",
    "a natural development of the theory described so far is the possibility to generate dynamically the three scales discussed above , thereby predicting them based on the spectral data and the unification point .",
    "dynamical generation of scales upon quantization has a long history dating back from sakharov  @xcite for the gravitational sector , and coleman and weinberg  @xcite for the higgs sector .",
    "the zeta spectral action   is a particular scale invariant extension of the scalar model .",
    "such extensions are promising for the solution of the naturalness ( hierarchy ) problem  @xcite . in this approach spontaneous symmetry breaking value is `` triggered '' by quantum correction and the higgs vacuum expectation value can be computed  @xcite , thus increasing predictive power .",
    "as far the gravitational sector is concerned , there are several examples where the gravitational constant can be induced , see for example the review  @xcite",
    ".    it would be fascinating to put a full fledged quantization of gravity in this scheme , nd even if this is still far in the future , we note that possible stating points could be conformal gravity , especially in the bender - mannhiem formalism @xcite , which leads to unitary and renormalizable theory of gravity @xcite and has interesting astrophysical consequences @xcite .",
    "interesting connections between conformal and einstein gravities are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in conclusion , the zeta spectral action is an interesting alternative to the usual cutoff spectral action .",
    "it shows promises of explaining the phenomenology of the standard model and beyond .",
    "in addition , the way it treats the fundamental scales could also shed some light on the explanation of some fundamental questions .",
