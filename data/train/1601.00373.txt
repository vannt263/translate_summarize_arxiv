    "supersymmetry ( susy ) @xcite gives a natural solution to the hierarchy problem suffered by the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "it provides a good dark matter ( dm ) candidate and realizes the gauge coupling unification . among the susy models , the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )",
    "@xcite has been intensively studied .",
    "however , the mssm suffers from the @xmath3-problem @xcite . in order to solve such a problem , a singlet field @xmath4",
    "is always introduced to replace the @xmath3 term of the mssm , the resulting model is the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model(nmssm).@xcite the effective @xmath3-term is generated by the dynamical generation of the @xmath3-term through the coupling @xmath5 when @xmath4 develops a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , nevertheless , since the higgs and dark matter have the singlet components , many other problems in the mssm can also be relaxed .",
    "for example , the little hierarchy problem of the mssm is relaxed by the generation of an extra tree - level mass term for the sm - like higgs boson .",
    "since the gauge interaction of singlet dominant higgs almost vanishes , its mass can be tuned to any value .",
    "this is a special feature of the nmssm , because of that the mass of higgs can be much smaller than the electro - weak ( ew ) scale , the interchange of the light higgs gives a conceivably self - interaction of the singlet sector . in a previous paper@xcite we studied the possibility of the dm self - interaction to solve the small cosmological scale anomalies in the singlet extensions of the mssm.@xcite we found that the correlation between the dm annihilation rate and dm - nucleon spin independent ( si ) cross section",
    "strongly constrains this model so that it can not realize the dm self - interacting scenario in the nmssm .",
    "after that , we found that dm self - interacting scenario can be realized by extending the singlet most generally ( denoted as gnmssm ) . in case of @xmath6 , the singlet forms a dark sector .",
    "dm is singlino , light cp - even higgs is the mediator . enough large parameter space survives and the sommerfeld enhancement factor can be realized too .",
    "as pointed in @xcite , the singlet cp - even higgs can not be exactly dark , it must decay before the start of the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) ( @xmath7 sec ) so the decay products will not affect bbn . this constraint sets a minimum interaction coupling between the standard model and the dark sector in order to facilitate the fast decay of the singlet higgs before the bbn era .",
    "but if the singlet higgs couples to the sm particles , the direct detection rate of dm will be enhanced greatly by the light mediator,@xcite thus it will be excluded by measurement of the si cross section .",
    "this seems to be an obstacle of the model .",
    "one way to solve such an obstacle is to add a right handed neutrino to the gnmssm , in which the singlet higgs decay into right handed sterile neutrino , and it has nothing to do with the quarks , escaping from the detection rate .",
    "in fact , there should be such a singlet in the particle spectrum since the oscillation of neutrino implies that mass and right handed neutrino probably exists .",
    "a realistic susy model must have the massive neutrinos , too .",
    "the most economical introduction should be replacing the singlet higgs with singlet right - handed neutrino superfield ( @xmath8).@xcite however , such a model violates the r - parity , giving no dm candidate . in order to preserve r - parity",
    ", @xmath8 must be an additional supermultiplet .",
    "a tev - scale majorana mass for the right - handed neutrino is dynamically generated through the @xmath9 coupling when @xmath4 develops a vev ( note that such a tev - scale majorana mass is too low for the see - saw mechanism and thus the neutrino yukawa couplings @xmath10 must be very small ) . in the same way , a tev - scale mass for the right - handed sneutrino can also be generated , which can serve as a good dark matter candidate @xcite . in paper @xcite",
    ", we find the right handed neutrino can enhance the mass of sm higgs several gev .    in this work we will study the susy model of singlet higgs and right handed neutrino , and check if the self - interacting dm scenario and bbn constraints can be realized .",
    "we will take into account of constraints from dm relic abundance .",
    "we organize the content as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we will show the details of the model and discuss the general interactions of dm . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we show the numerical results , and conclusion is given in sec .",
    "as talked in the introduction , the @xmath3 term can not be replaced by singlet right handed neutrino @xmath11 in the gnmssm , and there must be a singlet higgs @xmath12 .",
    "the superpotential is @xcite w = w_yukawa + + _ s ^2 + ^3 + _",
    "n^2 + _n ^2  , [ grn - sp ] where @xmath13 note that here we impose r - parity and thus the linear and triple terms of @xmath11 are forbidden . as a result",
    ", there is no vev for the right - handed sneutrino ( we will show how to get the global minimum in the following ) .",
    "we set @xmath0 so that the singlet sector decouples from the sm sector . in the following discussion , we will concentrate on the singlet sector .",
    "the soft susy breaking terms take the form -l _ & = & m_s^2 | s |^2 + ( c_s + b_s _ s s^2 + a_s^3 + ) [ soft - gm ] + & + & m_n^2 | n |^2 + ( b_n _ n n^2 + _n a_n sn^2 + ) .",
    "the first line is the soft terms of the singlet higgs , while the second line is of the right handed sneutrino .",
    "the main difference between the nmssm and gnmssm is reflected in their higgs sectors which contain different singlet higgs mass matrices and self - interactions .",
    "the difference mainly comes from the f - term potential : v_f_s & = & |+_s s + s^2+_n n^2|^2 + & = & |s^2|^2 + ^2+_s^2|s|^2 + ( _ s s + s^2 + _ s s^2 s^+ ) + v_f_n & = & |2_n s+_n|^2 |n|^2 .",
    "since @xmath14 is a constant , the @xmath15 terms can be absorbed by the redefinition of the soft susy breaking parameters @xmath16 .",
    "then , the singlet potential is v & = & v_f+v_soft + & = & m_s^2|s|^2 + ( c_s+b_s _ ss^2 + a _  s^3 + _ s s^2 s^+ ) + & + & |2_n s+_n|^2 |n|^2+m_n^2 | n |^2 + ( b_n _",

    "we set @xmath23 at tev scale , thus the majorana mass is too small for the conventional see - saw mechanism and the yukawa coupling @xmath24 should be very small ( @xmath25 ) and be neglected . since there is no dirac mass term here , the mass spectrum of the right - handed neutrino sector is also very simple .",
    "denoting @xmath26 , there are only one cp - even right - handed sneutrino ( denoted as @xmath27 ) and one cp - odd right - handed sneutrino ( denoted as @xmath28 ) .",
    "the right - handed neutrino is denoted as @xmath29 . from eq .",
    "( [ vform ] ) , we can get the spectrum as m_r^2 & = & ( 2_n v_s+_n)^2 + m_n^2 + 2_n v_s a_n + 2_n(v_s^2 - v_u v_d ) + m_m^2 & = & ( 2_n v_s+_n)^2 + m_n^2 - 2_n v_s a_n - 2_n(v_s^2 - v_u v_d ) + m_n & = & _ n + 2_n v_s . [ rnspc ] note that in our numerical study we require @xmath30 and @xmath31 be positive , and , as a result , the global minimum of the scalar potential locates at the zero point of the right - handed sneutrino field ( the right - handed sneutrino has no vev and r - parity is preserved ) .    with the above spectrum we can get the couplings between the higgs and the right - handed neutrino / sneutrino .",
    "we list the corresponding feynman rules for the following calculation : v_hhh & = & -k(6s+a_+3_s)=-(3m_+a _ ) , + v_haa & = & -(2s - a_+_s)=-(m_-a _ ) , + v_h&=&- , + v_a&=&i^5 , v_h n n&=&-_n , + v_a n n&=&i_n^5 , + v_rn&=&-_n , + v_mn&=&_n^5 .",
    "note that lighter right handed sneutino can be a dm candidate . in this work , we require that the lsp is singlino @xmath17 .",
    "as talked in the introduction , the predictions of the @xmath32cdm model on small cosmological scale structures seem not so successful and there are mainly three anomalies : _ missing satellites _ , _ cusp vs  core _ , _ too big to fail_. @xcite . to solve these problems",
    ", it needs a proper self - interaction between dark matter that can give the non - relativistic self - scattering cross section.@xcite the scattering cross section between dm can be described by quantum mechanics . in our model , interchanging @xmath19 between singlino @xmath17 forms a yukawa potential v(r)=e^-m_h r.[vyukawa ] since mass of @xmath19 can be tuned to any value , self interaction can be realized without right handed neutrino .",
    "we will check the case of participation of right handed neutrino . also we will set @xmath29 lighter than @xmath33 so that @xmath19 can decay to the right handed neutrino @xmath29 to satisfy the bbn constraint .",
    "@xcite the numerical results are shown in the following section .",
    "the numerical input for the simulation of small scales is the differential cross section @xmath34 as a function of the dm relative velocity @xmath35 .",
    "the standard cross section @xmath36 receives a strong enhancement in the forward backward scattering limit ( @xmath37 ) , which does not change the dm particle trajectories .",
    "thus two additional cross sections are defined to parameterize transport  @xcite , the transfer cross section @xmath38 and the viscosity ( or conductivity ) cross section @xmath39:@xcite _ t = d ( 1- ) , [ sigmat ] _ v = d ^2 .",
    "@xmath38 is for the estimation of the dirac dm , while @xmath38 is for the majorana dm .",
    "since the singlino @xmath17 is a majorana fermion , thus we should check the viscosity cross section which should be defined with two variables : & = &    & = & |f()-f(-)|^2 = | _ ( ) ^ ( 2 + 1 ) ( ( 2i_l)-1)p_()|^2 [ sigmavasum ] using the orthogonality relation for the legendre polynomials , we can obtain & = & _ ( ) ^4 ^ 2(_+2 -_)(+1)(+2)/(2 + 3 ) , [ sigmavs ] + & = & _ ( ) ^4 ^ 2(_+2 -_)(+1)(+2)/(2 + 3 ) .",
    "[ sigmava1 ] the phase shift @xmath40 must be computed by solving the schrdinger equation @xmath41 directly with partial wave expansion method .",
    "the total wave function of the spin-1/2 fermionic dm must be antisymmetric with respect to the interchange of two identical particles",
    ". then the spatial wave function should be symmetric when the total spin is 0 ( singlet ) while the spatial wave function should be antisymmetric when the total spin is 1 ( triplet ) . in our following analysis",
    ", we assume that the dm scatters with random orientations , thus the triplet is three times as likely as the singlet and the average cross section will be _ v = _ vs+ _ va .[sigmava ; ; ]    since @xmath6 we do not need to take care of the direct detection rate of dm , but the observed relic abundence of dm must be considered . in our model , @xmath17 can annihilate to singlet higgs and right handed neutrino , and the rate determines the relic density which gives a stringent constraints on the model .",
    "the general form of the annihilation cross section is given by @xcite v = , where @xmath4 is the symmetry factor , @xmath42 are the contributions from different spin states of dm and @xmath43 is given by |_f=  , with @xmath44 being the final states .",

    "the analytical results of @xmath46 is shown in the appendix .",
    "next we do the numerical calculation to see if the model can survive under the constraints of relic density , scattering cross section and bbn . from the spectrum and feynman rules above",
    ", we can see that the mass parameters of the six particles ( @xmath47 ) can be set freely because the relevant input soft parameters can take arbitrary values .",
    "this makes the following calculation much easier and we can choose the input parameters easily without fine - tuning",
    ". then we have nine input parameters in our calculation , namely m _ ,  m_h ,  m_a ,  m_r ,  m_m ,  m_n ,  a _ ,  ,  _n .",

    "the left plot shows the case of only one mediator scalar @xmath19 , the middle plot shows the case of only singlet higgs in the gnmssm , while the right plots shows the results of the model above which is gnmssm plus a right handed neutrino .    from fig.[fig3 ]",
    ", we can see that the simulation of small structure gives a stringent constraints on the self interacting dm , especially , when there is only one light mediator .",
    "however , there still are points left which satisfy all the requirements of dwarf scale , milky way and cluster .",
    "gnmssm without right handed neutrino has a larger parameter space to solve the anomalies of all three small scales .",
    "the reason is that in the dm self - interaction model @xcite dm can only annihilate into @xmath53 via @xmath54-channel and @xmath55-channel while in the gnmssm dm can annihilate into @xmath53 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 via @xmath54-channel , @xmath55-channel and @xmath58-channel , as shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the results of gnmssm with right handed neutrino are almost the same as that without it .",

    "one can check that if @xmath1 is greater than @xmath59 , the mediator ( 10 mev ) can decay much earlier before 1 second , thus it is much easy to meet the bbn requirement .    though bbn constraints on @xmath1 is loose",
    ", the survived parameter space of the model can be changed when @xmath1 is at order of @xmath2 the annihilation to @xmath29 become significant .",
    "this can been seen from the left plot of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] that when @xmath1 increases up to @xmath2 , @xmath60 begins to decrease to a small value . in this case , the annihilation channels to @xmath29 ( shown in fig.[fig2 ] ) give proper contribution to the relic density of dm .",
    "the right plot shows survived points in @xmath61 space .",
    "we can see that as @xmath1 increases , the mass of mediator @xmath19 is constraint to several mev .",
    "moreover an interaction strength @xmath62 has been advocated as a way of suppressing the standard active - to - sterile oscillation production process , easing the cosmological constraints from @xmath63.@xcite note that the right handed sterile neutrino @xmath29 must decay prior to bbn too .",
    "the dominant decay channel is to three active neutrinos with rate @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the sterile - active mixing angle .",
    "a proper @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) can make sure that a mev order @xmath29 decays at a pre - bbn time.@xcite in all , we conclude that adding right handed neutrino to the gnmssm gives a satisfactory solution to the otherwise problematic decay of @xmath19 .",
    "in this work , in order to solve the bbn constraints on the singlet higgs we add the right handed neutrino to the gnmssm .",
    "we calculated the spectrum and feynman rules . and studied the the dm phenomenalogy . in case",
    "the @xmath0 the singlet sector can give perfect explanation of relic abundance and small structure simulations .",
    "the bbn constraints on the light mediator @xmath19 can be easily solved by decaying to the right handed neutrino . in case of the @xmath1 at the order of @xmath2 , the mass of the mediator mass can be constrained to several mev .",
    "since we set @xmath67 the direct detection rate does nt need to be considered . in case of @xmath68 ,",
    "the singlet higgs and right handed neutrino will interact with the gauge sector , the resusts will appear in our further studies .",
