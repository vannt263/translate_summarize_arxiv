    "the group of stars showing the b[e ] phenomenon is heterogeneous and has been divided by @xcite into subgroups according to their evolutionary phase .",
    "these subgroups contain supergiants , herbig stars , symbiotic objects and compact planetary nebulae .",
    "the biggest group , however , are the unclassified b[e ] stars whose evolutionary phase is not or not unambiguously known .",
    "the optical spectra of the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) b[e ] supergiant hen s 18 and of the galactic unclassified b[e ] star hen 2 - 90 show both the presence of very strong emission in the [ oi ] lines which indicates that there must be a huge amount of neutral material close to the star .    in a recent paper",
    ", @xcite showed that the disks around b[e ] supergiants can indeed become neutral , i.e. hydrogen can recombine , even close to the hot stellar surface , simply due to the high equatorial mass fluxes of these stars that result in effective shielding of the disk material from the ionizing stellar continuum photons .",
    "emission of oi is expected to arise from regions in which hydrogen is neutral due to the about equal ionization potentials of h and o. the best location is therefore the outflowing disk . to simplify the model calculations we assume that the outflowing disk is neutral in hydrogen already at the stellar surface .",
    "the only free electrons available to collisionally excite the levels in oi result from elements like fe which have a much lower ionization potential than h. the electron density is therefore of order @xmath7 depending on metallicity and on the internal ionization structure , i.e. temperature distribution , of the disk .",
    "the radial hydrogen density distribution is given by the equation of mass continuity .",
    "the terminal velocities for each star are derived from the wings of their [ oi ] lines ( see figs.[velo_s18 ] and [ velo_2 - 90 ] ) assuming that hen s 18 is seen under an intermediate angle and hen 2 - 90 is seen edge - on .",
    "we calculate the level population by solving the statistical equilibrium equations in a 5-level atom .",
    "since the forbidden lines are optically thin , no radiation transfer needs to be calculated which simplifies our analysis .",
    "there are three [ oi ] lines in our spectra of which we model the luminosities .",
    "these lines have laboratory wavelengths of 5577 ,  6300 ,  and 6364  ( see figs.[velo_s18 ] and [ velo_2 - 90 ] ) .",
    "hen s 18 is a supergiant with effective temperature @xmath8k , a luminosity of @xmath9 and a radius of about @xmath10r@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "its distance is roughly 60kpc .",
    "the oxygen abundance is set to @xmath12 , which is a mean smc value . in fig.[fits ] we show results for the line luminosity calculations for the [ oi ] lines indicated .",
    "we need a disk mass flux of @xmath0gs@xmath1@xmath2 which results into a disk mass loss rate of @xmath13m@xmath11yr@xmath1 if we assume that the disk covers a fraction of about 0.2 of the total volume .",
    "we want to strengthen that this is a lower limit to the disk ( and therefore the total ) mass loss rate of the star because we used the typical smc abundance in our calculations .",
    "since supergiants are normally in an evolved phase , the surface oxygen abundance might be much lower due to several dredge - ups .",
    "an underabundance in o would then result in a much higher mass flux needed to explain the observed line luminosities .",
    "hen 2 - 90 has been classified either as a symbiotic object or as a compact planetary nebula .",
    "its hst image @xcite reveals a bipolar high - ionized wind , a low - ionized wind at intermediate latitudes as well as a high - density circumstellar disk . in addition",
    ", a bipolar jet has been found with several knots extending up to @xmath14  on both sides of the star .",
    "the clearly distinct regions of different ionization degrees leads us to the assumption that hen 2 - 90 has either a latitude dependent surface temperature being hotter on the poles , or a latitude dependent mass flux being strongest at the equator , or both .",
    "the star is at a distance of about 2kpc and the following stellar parameters are known : @xmath15k , @xmath16r@xmath11 and @xmath17 @xcite . in fig.[fits ] we show the modeled line luminosities .",
    "the disk mass flux is found to be of order @xmath3gs@xmath1@xmath2 . from the hst image",
    "we find that the disk covers about 0.2 of the wind volume leading to a disk mass loss rate of about @xmath18m@xmath11yr@xmath1 .    for this star we did not only model the [ oi ] lines but almost all available forbidden lines arising in the optical spectrum @xcite .",
    "these lines come from all the different ionization regions in the non - spherical wind seen in the hst image . from a self - consistent modeling",
    "we find that the star must be underabundant in c , n , and also in o with an o abundance of only @xmath19 .",
    "we could explain the different ionization regions indeed in terms of a latitude dependent mass flux as well as a latitude dependent surface temperature which might be explained in terms of a rapidly rotating underlying star .",
    "in addition , we could fix the total mass loss rate of hen 2 - 90 to about @xmath20m@xmath5yr@xmath1 .",
    "it is obvious that our model predicts for both stars a [ oi ] 5577  luminosity which is higher than the observed value .",
    "this line corresponds to the transition @xmath21 in our adopted 5-level atom .",
    "there exists one single permitted transition between its upper level and an energetically much higher lying level with wavelength @xmath22  which falls into the wavelength range covered by a broadened ly@xmath23 line ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the fifth level might therefore be depopulated radiatively into this higher state from which several permitted lines arise .",
    "consequently , the observable 5577  line luminosity will decrease .",
    "this depopulation mechanism might also explain why the 5577  line is much narrower than the other two [ oi ] lines in our sample .",
    "nevertheless , the presence of [ oi ] lines proofs the existence of cool and neutral material close to hot b[e ] stars . from modeling the line luminosities",
    "we could ( i ) fix a temperature distribution within the disk and ( ii ) determine the disk mass fluxes resulting in disk mass loss rates which are lower limits to the total mass loss rates for the two studied stars .",
