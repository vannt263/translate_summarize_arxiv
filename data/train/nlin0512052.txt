    "properties of discrete solitons in the dnls equation with the simplest , cubic , nonlinearity have been studied in detail , including three dimensional settings @xcite , and are now well understood .",
    "these solitons were experimentally observed in arrays of nonlinear optical waveguides @xcite .",
    "they also correspond , in the dnls approximation , to the intrinsic localized modes in more sophisticated dynamical lattices .",
    "nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equations with more complex nonlinearities were studied in detail in continuum models . as well as their cubic counterparts , such models are of interest by themselves , and",
    "may also have direct applications @xcite .",
    "in particular , glasses and organic optical media whose dielectric response features the cubic - quintic ( cq ) nonlinearity , i.e. , a self - defocusing quintic correction to the self - focusing cubic kerr effect , are known @xcite .",
    "properties of solitons in the nls equations with the cq nonlinearity may be very different from those in the simplest cubic equation , especially in the case when the higher - order nonlinearity is combined with a periodic potential .",
    "recently , a great variety of multistable solitons with different numbers of peaks and different symmetries ( even , odd , etc . ) have been found in the cq nls equation embedded in the linear potential of the kronig - penney ( kp ) type ( a periodic array of rectangular potential wells ) @xcite , after bistable solitons were studied in the cq nls equation with a single rectangular potential well @xcite .",
    "solitons in the continuum cubic nls equation with the kp potential have been studied too @xcite .",
    "the limiting case of the cq nls equation with a very strong kp potential naturally reduces to the dnls equation with the cq nonlinearity , and our objective in this paper is to construct solitons in this discrete model and explore their stability .",
    "the model is not only interesting by itself ( as is shown in the present work ) , but may also be realized experimentally in the form of an array of waveguides built of the above - mentioned optical materials featuring the cq nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "it is relevant to mention that stable discrete solitons were recently found in the dnls equation with saturable nonlinearity @xcite ( note that the latter model was introduced back in 1975 by vinetskii and kukhtarev @xcite ) , and , moreover , optical discrete solitons supported by the saturable self - defocusing nonlinearity were experimentally created using the photovoltaic effect in a waveguiding lattice built into a photorefractive crystal @xcite .",
    "we show in this work that discrete solitons in the cq model are very different from their counterparts investigated in the aforementioned works@xcite , ( most importantly , they feature a great multistability , as shown below ) due to the fundamental fact that , unlike the saturable nonlinearity , the combination of the cq terms features _ competition _ of self - focusing and defocusing types . for the same reason , the solitons in the cq dnls equation are drastically different from ones investigated earlier @xcite in the dnls  equation with a _",
    "single _ nonlinear term of an arbitrary power ( for instance , quintic instead of cubic ) . finally , a quantum version of a finite - length dnls equation ( bose - hubbard model ) with the cq nonlinearity and periodic boundary conditions was considered in ref .",

    "since all these regions share the common base , there should be a nontrivial area where , presumably , the @xmath42 solitons exist and are _",
    "stable for all values of _ @xmath43 .",
    "it is also apparent from the stability diagram in fig .",
    "[ stability.ps ] that the stability regions for the @xmath37 solutions with different @xmath43 , in contrast to their @xmath42 counterparts , do not intersect each other . therefore , the solitons of the @xmath36 type feature no multistability .",

    "particularly , the @xmath38 region is completely embedded in the @xmath35 region .",
    "this property tends to suggest that , for any @xmath43 , there always exists non - empty regions where the @xmath42 and @xmath37 solitons coexist and are _ simultaneously stable_. it is interesting too that the @xmath36-stability regions outlive their @xmath41-counterparts as @xmath7 increases .",
    "this is due to the fact that the @xmath41 solutions correspond to the second family of homoclinic crossings that disappear , in saddle - node bifurcations ( see below ) , earlier than the first family of the crossings ( i.e. , the @xmath36 solutions ) .",
    "existence regions for the solitons , which may be broader than the regions where the solitons are stable , are defined as those in which the stable and unstable manifolds emanating from the origin do intersect .",
    "we have computed such a region numerically . in fig.[stability.ps ] , it is located to the right of the dashed - dotted line eb ( _ existence boundary _ ) . to the left of this curve , no localized solutions are possible . as @xmath7 increases , the eb curve approaches the line @xmath51 , that corresponds to the existence border for solitons in the continuum limit of the cq equation @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the existence regions of the @xmath41 solutions _ exactly coincide _ with their stability regions , i.e. , the solitons of the  @xmath41 type are _",

    "we also note that ( as explained in detail below ) the @xmath37 solutions represent only two distinct families of solitons , one site - centered ( for odd @xmath43 ) and one bond - centered ( for even @xmath43 ) .",

    ", we take the @xmath35 solution at @xmath54 , which is in the gap between the stability regions of the @xmath35 and @xmath52 solutions .",
    "a _ loop _ of pitchfork bifurcations occurs in the gaps between consecutive @xmath36-stability regions , see details in the next section .",
    "the evolution of this unstable solution amounts to periodic oscillations between the original @xmath35 soliton ( the solid line at @xmath45 ) and its translation by one site ( the dashed line at @xmath45 ) ) .",
    "therefore , this solution is a time - periodic one , being close to a heteroclinic connection linking the two unstable solutions , @xmath35 and its translation .",
    "in this section we aim to explain how the @xmath38 solutions disappear and how the evolution of the @xmath36 solutions leads to stability changes and creation of pairs of _ stable asymmetric _ solitons .",
    "it is straightforward to understand the simultaneous disappearance of the @xmath36 and @xmath41-type solutions as @xmath7 increases .",
    "the boundary on which this happens corresponds to the left side of the tent - like stability area of the @xmath41 solutions in fig .",
    "[ stability.ps ] .",
    "the @xmath37 and @xmath42 solutions collide on this boundary and disappear in a saddle - node bifurcation .",

    "[ tangles.ps](b ) , the stable and unstable manifolds barely intersect , and the two solitons are nearly identical . exactly at the bifurcation , the manifolds touch tangentially , and only one solution is generated ( i.e. ,  the @xmath35 and @xmath38 solitons are identical at this point ) . after this saddle - node bifurcation",
    ", these solutions do not exist anymore .",
    "another family of noteworthy bifurcations points corresponds to cuspidal points of the @xmath41-stability regions .",
    "three types of bifurcations occur near these points : ( a ) the saddle - node bifurcation described above , at which the @xmath36 and @xmath41 solitons collide and disappear ; ( b ) another saddle - node bifurcation , at which the @xmath41 solutions disappear ; and ( c ) a bifurcation at which the @xmath36 solitons lose their stability .",

    "bifurcation ( c ) deserves more attention . in fig .",
    "[ inset_bif.ps ] we depict in more detail the bifurcation scenario corresponding to a route from the stability region of @xmath35 to its @xmath52 counterpart , which passes through a gap where no @xmath36 solution is stable .",

    "the existence of a pitchfork loop a supercritical pitchfork shortly followed by a reverse subcritical one is evident . in panel ( a ) we depict by a square point one of the homoclinic intersections , which gives rise to solution @xmath35 . as @xmath7 increases , the supercritical pitchfork bifurcation is reached , panel ( b ) , that gives rise to a pair of extra homoclinic intersections ( see panel ( c ) and triangle and circle in panel ( d ) ) . as @xmath7 increases further , the reverse subcritical pitchfork occurs , eliminating the extra pair of intersections .",
    "quite interesting are the shape and stability of solitons that this extra pair generates in the narrow gap between the @xmath37 and @xmath57 stability regions ( which coincides with the region of the pitchfork loop ) , where these new solutions exist .",
    "they represent _ asymmetric _ solitons of the cq dnls equation , which are depicted in fig .",
    "[ manyorbits](b ) by means of triangles and circles .",
    "as might be expected , the stability is swapped by the pitchfork bifurcations .",
    "indeed , the stable @xmath36 solitons are unstable inside the pitchfork loop , where the new asymmetric solutions are _ stable_. an example of unstable evolution of an @xmath36 soliton inside the pitchfork loop is shown in the bottom row of fig .",
    "[ unstable_evol.ps ] .",
    "we stress that such pitchfork loops , and the respective asymmetric solitons , do not exist in the cubic dnls equation ( asymmetric solitons were also found in a dnls equation with a mixture of cubic onsite and intersite nonlinearities @xcite ) .",
    "further inspection of the pitchfork loop demonstrates that , if the @xmath35 _ site - centered _ soliton looses its stability through the direct bifurcation , then the reverse bifurcation , which closes the loop , stabilizes an @xmath52 _ bond - centered _ soliton . at the next pitchfork loop ( in the gap between stability of @xmath52 and @xmath58 ) , the latter bond - centered solution gets destabilized and , after the loop , an @xmath58 _ site - centered _ soliton gains its stability .",
    "as @xmath7 is increased further , this process repeats itself , creating stability bands for the @xmath37 solitons for larger @xmath43 .",
    "in fact , all the solutions @xmath37 represent only two distinct soliton families emanating from the principal homoclinic intersection : of site - centered solutions , and of bond - centered ones , the pitchfork loops conducting stability swaps between the two families . for given @xmath37 ,",
    "the number of the pitchfork loops passed by the soliton , while developing from the anti - continuum ( @xmath49 ) limit , is @xmath59 .",
    "the existence of _ stable _ bond - centered solitons is a noteworthy feature by itself , as in the usual dnls model with the cubic nonlinearity only site - centered states are stable ( in the dnls equation with the saturable onsite nonlinearity , stable bond - centered solitons were found too @xcite ) .",
    "an interesting issue which still has to be addressed is whether there exists an accumulation curve for the pitchfork loops , or the loops continue to appear as one approaches the continuum limit , @xmath60 .",
    "the variational approximation ( va ) can be used to describe the shape of stationary soliton solutions in an analytical form .",
    "the method will not only be successful in approximating the shape of the most fundamental solitons , but will also predict the saddle - node bifurcation where the @xmath38 and @xmath35 solutions collide and disappear .",

    "( [ mu ] ) , may be stable if @xmath78 , and is definitely unstable otherwise , where @xmath79 is the soliton s norm defined as per eq .",
    "( [ m ] ) .",
    "the simplest variational ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) yields @xmath80 [ note that both @xmath63 and @xmath62 depend on @xmath72 through eqs .  ( [ eigen ] ) and ( [ quad ] ) ] . the norm given by the latter expression is depicted , as a function of @xmath72 , in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ ap_am.ps ] .",
    "it is clear from the figure that @xmath81 for the @xmath38 soliton , and @xmath78 for @xmath35 ( these results can be proven analytically , within the framework of the va ) .",
    "thus , the vk criterion suggests that the @xmath38 soliton is unstable , while its @xmath35 counterpart may be stable . comparing this conclusion with the numerical results for the stability reported above",
    "we conclude that the vk criterion _ does not _ apply to our model .",
    "in fact , similar conclusions for the failure of the vk criterion where obtained in the _ continuous _ cq nls equation with an external potential , that might be both a single rectangular potential well @xcite , and a periodic lattice of rectangular wells ( the above - mentioned kronig - penney potential ) @xcite .",
    "a natural question that arises is the existence of multistable solutions in higher dimensional lattices .",
    "the higher dimensional equivalent of ( [ cqdnls ] ) is obtained by replacing the one - dimensional index @xmath4 and the discrete laplacian by their higher - dimensional analogues .",
    "unfortunately , the homoclinic approach is not applicable in higher dimensional lattices .",
    "nonetheless , the variational approach presented here is still amenable in the higher dimensional case .",
    "namely , a natural ansatz equivalent to ( [ ansatzva2 ] ) but now in two dimensions ( 2d ) becomes @xmath82 \\beta a & \\mathrm{~if~ } & n = m=0,\\end{array}\\right . \\label{ansatz2dva2}\\ ] ] where now we have two indexes @xmath83 along the two spatial dimensions , and the decay @xmath84 is the same as for the one - dimensional case [ cf .",
    "( [ eigen ] ) ] .",
    "preliminary results indicate the coexistence of _ stable _ soliton solutions in the 2d model . as an example we depict in fig .",
    "[ 2dva2.ps ] six coexisting solutions for the same parameter values .",
    "the top row in the figure depicts three _ stable _ coexisting solutions .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the variational approach for the 2d case is also able to capture other solutions such as , stable and unstable , multi - humped profiles ( see bottom row of fig .  [ 2dva2.ps ] ) .",
    "a detailed stability analysis for higher dimensional ( 2d and 3d ) soliton solutions falls outside of the scope of the present manuscript and will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the objective of this work was to introduce the discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) equation with the competing cubic - quintic ( cq ) nonlinearities . besides being a new dynamical model",
    ", this model may also apply to the description of an array of optical waveguides with the intrinsic cq nonlinearity .",
    "we have studied the multistability of discrete solitons in the model , looking for homoclinic solutions to the respective stationary discrete equation .",
    "regions of the existence and stability of single - humped soliton solutions were identified by using a numerical continuation method based on newton - type iterations .",
    "the stability of the various types of the solitons was investigated through numerical evaluation of eigenvalues for small perturbations .",
    "the resulting stability diagram suggests the existence of an infinite family of branches of _ stable _ solitons of the aforementioned type @xmath42 , for sufficiently small values of the coupling constant @xmath7 . as @xmath7 increases",
    ", these solutions get destroyed through saddle - node bifurcations .",
    "we have also identified another type of discrete soliton solutions , @xmath37 , with @xmath35 surviving in the continuum limit , @xmath33 .",
    "the stability of solutions of the latter type ( @xmath36 ) changes , with the increase of @xmath7 , through a series of small pitchfork loops ( each opens with a supercritical pitchfork , which is shortly followed by a reverse supercritical one ) .",
    "inside the loops the symmetric solitons @xmath37 loose their stability , while a pair of _ stable asymmetric _ solutions is created .",
    "the latter solutions have no counterpart in the cubic dnls equation , nor in the continuum cq  nls equation .",
    "finally , using the variational approximation ( va ) , we were able to approximate the main branches of the solutions and their bifurcations for small @xmath7 .",
    "we have also proposed an improved version of the va , with two free parameters rather than one , that drastically ( qualitatively ) upgrades the accuracy of the va , making it possible to predict simultaneously the most fundamental solitons and some higher - order ones .",
    "an interesting extension of this work would be to thoroughly investigate localized solutions in the two - dimensional version of the cq dnls equation , which may be realized , for instance , as a _ bunch _ of the corresponding nonlinear optical waveguides ( cf . the recently reported experimental realization for linear waveguides @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the existence and stability of _ asymmetric _ solitons in the two - dimensional model would be an issue of great interest .",
    "another promising direction for further considerations may be the study of kink solutions , corresponding to heteroclinic trajectories generated by the intersection of the stable and unstable manifolds of different fixed points of the map ( [ 2dmap ] ) .",
    "as concerns the underlying mathematical theory , an intriguing issue is to understand why the vakhitov - kolokolov criterion was found to consistently fail in the discrete cq nls equation and its counterpart with a periodic potential in the continuum case @xcite .",
