    "in the past , experiments with solar neutrinos and experiments with neutrinos from nuclear reactors probed different ranges of the parameter space for neutrino oscillations . basically , the distances between source and detector in reactor neutrino experiments ( @xmath0  km ) were too short to probe the parameter space relevant to explain the solar neutrino deficit @xcite",
    ". in the very near future , with the upcoming experiments kamland @xcite and borexino @xcite , it will be possible to study the parameter space of the large mixing angle ( lma ) solution not only with solar , but as well with reactor neutrinos .",
    "although borexino is optimized for solar neutrino detection , it will be able to detect @xmath1 s from far distant european nuclear reactors @xcite .",
    "_ vice versa _ , kamland is dedicated to reactor neutrino spectroscopy , however , if radio impurities are sufficiently low , it will also measure solar neutrinos .",
    "future projects , for example lens @xcite and xmass @xcite , seek to measure the primary pp- , @xmath2be- and cno neutrino fluxes in real time via neutrino capture and neutrino - electron scattering respectively . such measurements will provide important information on the flavor of solar neutrinos , on mixing parameters and on solar physics .",
    "if the lma solution is realized in nature , @xmath3 will be determined with high accuracy using reactor neutrinos .",
    "however , the measurement of the mixing angle will be statistically limited .",
    "precision measurements of the pp- and @xmath2be fluxes by elastic scattering ( es ) or neutrino capture ( cc ) would improve considerably the accuracy of the determination of the mixing angle . if the `` low '' , `` ( quasi- ) vac '' or small mixing angle ( sma ) is the correct solution ( see fig .  1 for terminology ) , then only solar neutrino experiments can explore the parameter spaces . full information of the solar neutrino spectrum , via both es and neutrino capture will be essential in any of the mentioned scenarios .",
    "since flavor conversion has been established from the the combined analysis of sno and super - kamiokande ( sk ) data @xcite , the scientific goals of upcoming experiments and future projects shift from discovery and identification of the deficit to a comprehensive study of the phenomena : first , to fix the specific region of the parameter space , and second , to measure with high accuracy the neutrino oscillation parameters and the primary solar neutrino fluxes .",
    "solar neutrinos are a unique tool to directly study the fusion processes in the interior of the sun .",
    "in particular , _ direct _ measurements , with energy information and in real time , of neutrinos from the primary pp- , @xmath2be- and cno processes are of fundamental interest . they will provide complementary information to observational data from helioseismology and probe the predictions of solar models .",
    "one of the main goals of future experiments is to study neutrino oscillations and determine the oscillation parameters . in particular",
    "they need to :    * confirm @xmath4 conversion seen by sk and sno at sub - mev energies ; * observe directly the signature of oscillations , i.e. time variations or energy spectrum deformations ; * probe flavor composition at sub - mev energies ( active vs. sterile neutrinos , sterile contributions ) ; * establish the correct oscillation solution ( lma , low , ( quasi-)vac , sma ) and measure the mixing parameters with high accuracy .",
    "other questions comprise : the investigation of @xmath5 , magnetic moment searches , coherent scattering off nuclei and neutrino instability .",
    "[ survival ]",
    "at @xmath7b @xmath6-energies the various oscillation solutions differ only slightly with respect to the energy dependence of the survival probability . at sub - mev energies ,",
    "however , they differ dramatically . moreover , for the low and vac solutions the survival probability varies periodically in time for sub - mev neutrinos .",
    "day / night variations will be observable in the case of the low solution and variations on the scale of weeks to months for vac solutions .",
    "1 displays the characteristic survival curves for various oscillation scenarios .",

    "two different design options for a detector based on 100 tons of natural molybdenum ( 9.6 tons of @xmath11mo ) exist : 1 ) a hybrid detector consisting of plastic scintillator bars interleaved by mo - foils ( 0.05 g / cm@xmath8 ) and read out with pmts via wave - length shifting fibers , or 2 ) a similar detector geometry with liquid scintillators instead of plastic . fig .",

    "for @xmath21yb a @xmath24 value of @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) was evaluated for the transition to the 194.5 kev ( 339 kev ) level @xcite . for @xmath20 in the weak matrix element is @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "these values are sufficiently accurate to evaluate the target mass necessary for the lens detector . however , to derive the neutrino fluxes , it is planned to use an artificial @xmath28cr neutrino source of several mci strength to calibrate the cross section at the few percent level .",
    "13 and 14 display the expected spectra and interaction rates for 20  t of natural ytterbium and 4  t of indium .",
