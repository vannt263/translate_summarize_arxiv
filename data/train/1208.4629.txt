    "@xcite the physical explanation is straightforward : the collapse of tension in the slinky occurs from the top down , and a finite time is required for a wave front to propagate down the slinky communicating the release of the top .    the basic wave physics behind this behavior follows from the equation of motion for a falling ( or suspended ) compression spring@xcite @xmath7 which applies to a tension spring when the turns are separated .",

    "the new model is fitted to data obtained from videos of the falls of two real slinkies having different properties .",
    "the model is shown to account for the observed positions of the top of each slinky in the experiments , and in particular reproduces the initial time - profile for the velocity of the top after release .",
    "the spring constant of the slinky is assumed as a free parameter in the model , and the best - fit model values are tested by comparison with independent determinations of the fundamental mode periods for the two slinkies , which depend on the spring constants .",
    "the model values appear consistent with the observations taking into account the observational uncertainties .",
    "the new model for the slinky dynamics during the fall developed here is semi - analytic , and allows treatment of a tension spring including approximate description of the dynamics of the collapse of the spring . during the collapse of the top of the slinky",
    "the turns collide , but the model does not describe this process in detail . instead , the collapse is approximately described by the assumption of a linear decrease in tension as a function of mass density along the spring behind the front initiating the collapse .",
    "the linear approximation is motivated by the experimental data from the slinky videos , which shows that the spacing between slinky turns during the collapse decreases approximately linearly with time .",
    "the behavior of a falling slinky is likely to be counter - intuitive to students and provides a useful ( and very simple ) undergraduate physics lecture demonstration .",
    "the explanation of the behavior may be supplemented by showing high - speed videos of the fall .",
    "the modeling of the process presented here is also relatively simple , and should be accessible to undergraduate students .",

    "<S> a slinky is an example of a tension spring : in an unstretched state a slinky is collapsed , with turns touching , and a finite tension is required to separate the turns from this state . if a slinky is suspended from its top and stretched under gravity and then released , the bottom of the slinky does not begin to fall until the top section of the slinky , which collapses turn by turn from the top , collides with the bottom . </S>",
    "<S> the total collapse time @xmath0 ( typically @xmath1s for real slinkies ) corresponds to the time required for a wave front to propagate down the slinky to communicate the release of the top end . </S>",
    "<S> we present a modification to an existing model for a falling tension spring  @xcite and apply it to data from filmed drops of two real slinkies . </S>",
    "<S> the modification of the model is the inclusion of a finite time for collapse of the turns of the slinky behind the collapse front propagating down the slinky during the fall . </S>",
    "<S> the new finite - collapse time model achieves a good qualitative fit to the observed positions of the top of the real slinkies during the measured drops . </S>",
