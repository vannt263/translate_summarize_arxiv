    "atom interferometers are very sensitive to inertial effects @xcite and this property was used to build accelerometers @xcite and gyrometers @xcite . because of this large sensitivity , a high mechanical stability of the experiment is required and several experiments @xcite used an active control of the interferometer vibrations .    in the present letter ,",
    "we study the phase noise induced by mechanical vibrations in three - gratings mach - zehnder thermal atom interferometers and we show that the rapid decrease of the fringe visibility with the diffraction order is largely due to this phase noise . vibrations displace and bend the rail which holds the three diffraction gratings and we have developed a model based on elasticity theory to describe this dynamics .",
    "we are thus able to understand the contributions of various frequencies and to make a detailed evaluation of this phase noise in the case of our setup : the result is in good agreement with the phase noise value deduced from fringe visibility measurements .",
    "we have built a very stiff rail for our atom interferometer and this arrangement has revealed very efficient : the remaining phase noise is dominated by rotations of the rail , which should be reduced by a better rail suspension .",

    "the observed fringe visibility is plotted as a function of the diffraction order @xmath4 in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "a gaussian fit , following equation ( [ n2 ] ) , represents very well the data in both cases and the quality of this fit suggests the importance of a phase noise from inertial origin .",
    "we consider a three - grating mach - zehnder interferometer represented in figure [ mzschematic ] .",
    "the inertial sensitivity of this type of interferometer is due to the existence of the diffraction phase which depends on the grating positions .",
    "the resulting phase of the interference signal is given by @xcite :    @xmath9\\ ] ]    here @xmath10 is the grating wavevector ( @xmath11 being the grating period ) ; @xmath4 is the diffraction order and @xmath12 the @xmath13-coordinate of a reference point of grating @xmath14 at time @xmath15 when it is crossed by the atomic wavepacket .",
    "equation ( [ n3 ] ) can be simplified by introducing the atom time of flight @xmath16 from one grating to the next , with @xmath17 and @xmath18 being the atom velocity ( we will neglect its dispersion throughout the present paper ) .",
    "we can express the time @xmath15 as a function of @xmath19 , which will be noted @xmath20 , and @xmath21 : @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",

    ", the first term is due to the instantaneous bending @xmath28 of the rail , the second term represents sagnac effect , as the velocity difference is related to the rail angular velocity , and the third term describes the sensitivity to accelerations .",
    "we want to relate the positions @xmath12 of the three gratings to the mechanical properties of the rail and to its coupling to the seismic noise . as the interferometer is sensitive only to the grating @xmath13-coordinates ,",
    "we use a 1d model to describe the rail dynamics .",
    "this model is based on elasticity theory @xcite in order to describe , in an unified way , the motion and the deformations of the rail . in this model ,",
    "the rail of length @xmath29 along the @xmath30 direction can bend only in the @xmath13 direction .",
    "the shape of its cross - section , assumed to be independent of the @xmath30-coordinate , is characterized by its area @xmath31 and by the moment @xmath32 , the @xmath13-origin being taken on the neutral line .",
    "the rail material has a density @xmath33 and a young s modulus @xmath34 .",
    "the neutral line is described by a function @xmath35 which measures the position of this line with respect to a galilean frame and which verifies @xcite :    @xmath36    the rail is coupled to the laboratory by forces and torques exerted at @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) by its supports .",
    "the @xmath13-component of the force @xmath39 and the @xmath40-component of the torque are respectively related @xcite to the third and second derivatives of @xmath35 with respect to @xmath30 .",
    "we assume that the torques vanish so that @xmath41 at @xmath37 and that the force is the sum of an elastic term proportional to the relative displacement and a damping term proportional to the relative velocity : @xmath42 - \\mu \\frac{\\partial\\left[x(\\epsilon l , t ) -x_{\\epsilon}(t ) \\right]}{\\partial t}\\ ] ]    where @xmath43 is the @xmath13-position of the support at @xmath44 and time @xmath20 .",
    "we introduce the fourier transforms @xmath45 and @xmath46 of the functions @xmath35 and @xmath47 .",
    "the general solution of equation ( [ elasticity1 ] ) is :    @xmath48    @xmath11 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the four @xmath52-dependent components of @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath50 and @xmath51 are related to @xmath11 and @xmath49 , thanks to assumption of vanishing torques",
    ". then @xmath11 and @xmath49 are linearly related to the source terms @xmath46 by equations ( [ elasticity3 ] ) . @xmath52 and @xmath53 are related by :    @xmath54    when @xmath55 is small enough , these equations predict a series of resonances . the first resonance , when @xmath56 , describes an in - phase oscillation of the two ends of the rail while the second resonance , occurring when @xmath57 , describes a rotational oscillation of the rail around its center",
    ". then , there is an infinite series of bending resonances occurring for @xmath58 verifying @xmath59 and @xmath60 related to the @xmath61 , by @xmath62 . in our model , the rail stiffness is described by one parameter only , namely @xmath61 .",
    "the fourier component @xmath64 of the phase @xmath6 given by equation ( [ n3 ] ) can be expressed as a function of the amplitudes @xmath11 and @xmath49 .",

    "this complicated equation can be given a very simple form by making expansions in powers of @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( assuming @xmath70 for further simplification ) :    @xmath71 \\frac{3i ( \\omega t)}{\\left(3-r\\right ) }   \\right .",

    "the first term , proportional to @xmath73 $ ] and to the time of flight @xmath21 , describes the effect of the rotation of the rail excited by the out of phase motion of its two ends .",
    "this term , which is independent of the stiffness of the rail , is sensitive to the rail suspension through the @xmath74 denominator .",
    "the second term is the sum of the bending term , in @xmath75 , and the acceleration term , in @xmath76 .",
    "both terms have the same sensitivity to the suspension of the rail , being sensitive to the first pendular resonance , when @xmath77 .",
    "the bending term is small if the rail is very stiff , i.e. when @xmath61 is large .",
    "when we built our interferometer , we knew that d. pritchard @xcite and siu au lee @xcite had been obliged to reduce @xmath28 in their atom interferometers by a servo - loop .",
    "rather than using a servo - loop , we decided to improve the grating stability by building a very stiff rail .",
    "we use aluminium alloy for its large @xmath78 ratio and we made the largest possible rail in the @xmath13 direction to get a large @xmath79 ratio . using equation ( [ solution11 ] ) , we estimate @xmath80 hz , in reasonable agreement with our measurement , @xmath81 hz , with a rather large q - factor , @xmath82 ( more details in @xcite ) .",
    "the suspension of the rail is very simple , with rubber blocks made to support machine tools . from a rough estimate of their force constant @xmath83 and the rail mass ,",
    "the first resonance is calculated to be at @xmath84 hz .    following previous works @xcite , the instaneous bending @xmath28",
    "is conveniently measured by a 3-grating mach - zehnder optical interferometer attached to the gratings of the atom interferometer .",
    "we have built such an interferometer @xcite , with @xmath85 lines / mm gratings from paton hawksley @xcite ( @xmath86 m@xmath87 ) and an helium - neon laser at @xmath88 nm .",
    "the phase @xmath89 of the signal of such an optical interferometer is also given by equation ( [ n4 ] ) simplified because the time of flight @xmath21 for light is negligible : @xmath90 .",
    "in our experiment , the excitation of the rail by the environment gives very small signals , from which we deduce an upper limit of the bending @xmath91 nm .    to evaluate the phase noise , we need to know the seismic noise spectrum .",
    "a spectrum was recorded on our setup well before the operation of our interferometer and we use this measurement as a good estimate of the seismic noise .",
    "we have replaced the recorded spectrum with several peaks appearing in the @xmath92 hz range by a smooth spectrum just larger than the measured one .",
    "most of the peaks do not appear on a spectrum taken on the floor , because they are due due to resonances of the structure supporting the vacuum pipes and their exact frequency has probably changed because of modifications of the experiment since the recording .",
    "the smoothed noise spectrum @xmath93 is plotted in figure [ noisespectra ] .",
    "this figure also plots the calculated phase noise spectrum @xmath94 , using equation ( [ excitation1 ] ) , and the sagnac phase noise spectrum @xmath95 deduced from equation ( [ excitation1 ] ) by keeping only the term proportional to the @xmath11 amplitude : clearly , sagnac phase noise is dominant except near the in - phase pendular oscillation and the first bending resonance .",
    "the contribution of the in - phase pendular oscillation depends strongly on its frequency and @xmath96-factor .",
    "the bending resonance is in a region where the excitation amplitude is very low , and , even after amplification by the resonance @xmath96-factor , the contribution of the bending resonance to the total phase noise is fully negligible .    in this calculation , we have not used our estimate of the first pendular resonance @xmath97 hz , because the predicted rms value of the bending @xmath98 was considerably larger than the measured upper limit .",
    "we have used @xmath99 hz , with @xmath100 and the measured @xmath61 value , @xmath101 hz and @xmath102 s ( @xmath103 and @xmath104 m / s ) .",
    "we assume that the two excitation terms @xmath105 have the same spectrum but no phase relation , so that we neglect the cross - term @xmath106 .",
    "for very low frequencies up to a few hertz , we expect @xmath107 and the associated correction would cancel the sagnac term and this why we have not extended the @xmath94 curves below @xmath108 hz .",
    "as soon as the frequency is larger than the lowest resonance frequency of the structure supporting the vacuum chambers ( near @xmath109 hz ) , the assumption that @xmath110 and @xmath111 have no phase relation should be good .    by integrating the phase noise over the frequency from @xmath108 to @xmath112 hz , we get an estimate of the quadratic mean of the phase noise :    @xmath113    this estimate compares well with the value @xmath114 , deduced from the fit of figure [ fig1 ] : we think that the agreement is convincing , if ones considers the large uncertainty on several parameters ( seismic noise , frequency and @xmath96 factors of the pendular resonances ) , .",
    "this result is largely due to sagnac phase noise , as the same integration only on sagnac phase noise gives @xmath115 rad@xmath116 and as shown by equation ( [ excitation4 ] ) , this phase noise can be reduced only by a modification of the rail suspension .",
    "the present paper has analyzed the phase noise induced in a mach - zehnder atom interferometer by mechanical vibrations ( more details in @xcite ) . starting from the well - known inertial sensitivity of atom interferometers ,",
    "we have developed a simple @xmath117d model describing the dynamics of the rail holding the diffraction gratings .",
    "this model provides an unified description of the low- and high - frequency dynamics , in which the rail behaves respectively as a solid object and an elastic object . in the low - frequency range , up to the frequency of the rotational resonance of the suspension , the out - of - phase vibrations of the two ends of the rail induce small rotations , which are converted into phase noise by sagnac effect , and this is the dominant cause of inertial phase noise in our interferometer .",
    "we think that the present analysis is important as it gives access to a reduction of this phase noise in atom interferometers .",
    "a better rail suspension should considerably reduce this phase noise .",
    "then , we would be able to observe atom interference effects with an excellent fringe visibility , close to the fitted value @xmath118 % of figure [ fig1 ] , and we would also be able to work either with diffraction orders @xmath119 or with considerably slower atoms .",
