    "the discovery of a higgs boson with mass of about 125 gev in 2012  @xcite at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) has initiated a new era of excitement in particle physics aimed at the understanding of the full nature of electroweak symmetry breaking . in particular",
    ", the question of whether this new boson is solely responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking and the origin of mass is a central thrust of the physics program at the lhc .",
    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics has been successful at explaining a wide range of experimental phenomena . however , there many open questions it fails to answer .",
    "similar to the introduction of the higgs mechanism to explain the su(2)@xmath10u(1 ) symmetry breaking of the sm , several extensions to the sm model have been proposed to address its incompleteness .",
    "for example , models of extra dimensions , such as the randall - sundrum ( rs ) model  @xcite , were introduced to solve the hierarchy problem by postulating that gravity is weaker compared to the other fundamental forces because it can propagate in extra spatial dimensions .",
    "while the extent of these new physics models is vast and their physics motivation often different , a common theme is the manifestation of new tev scale neutral gauge bosons ( @xmath11 ) that can be probed at the lhc . at the cern lhc ,",
    "the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite experiments have an extensive physics program to search for @xmath11 .",
    "a widely used model in these searches is the sequential standard model ( seqsm ) , which predicts a spin-1 neutral boson ( @xmath12 ) with sm - like couplings  @xcite .",
    "results of direct searches for high mass dilepton resonances in proton - proton collisions at @xmath13 , 8 , and 13 tev exclude @xmath12 masses below 3.75 and 2.1 tev in the @xmath7 and @xmath6 channels , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the strategy pursued in those analyses is a simple and robust dilepton selection , targeting production via drell - yan ( dy ) processes of order @xmath14 ( i.e. @xmath15 ) , with high signal acceptance that produces a `` bump '' ( narrow in @xmath7 and broad in @xmath6 ) in the reconstructed invariant mass spectrum of lepton pairs that sits above a smooth and steeply falling background distribution .",
    "the focus of this paper is to propose new searches for @xmath11 bosons at the lhc using events produced through vector boson fusion ( vbf ) processes ( figure  [ fig : feyn ] ) .",
    "the tagging of events produced though vbf processes has been proposed by some of the present authors as an effective experimental tool for dark matter ( dm ) and electroweak supersymmetry ( susy ) searches at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been shown in  @xcite that vbf processes become increasingly more important for probing large mass scales due to collinear logarithmic enhancements in the production cross - sections .",
    "this characteristic is particularly interesting in light of the recent observation of a @xmath16 excess ( local significance ) near @xmath17 gev in the high - mass diphoton searches at atlas and cms .",
    "although the significance of this bump has decreased with the 13 tev data acquired this year  @xcite , it has motivated exploring the effectiveness of the vbf topology for tev scale @xmath11 searches .",
    "additionally , the vbf topology provides effective reduction of the qcd multijet background in susy and dm searches  @xcite , which is an important characteristic which can also be utilized in @xmath11 searches which suffer from large qcd multijet backgrounds , such as @xmath18 .",
    "although there are many ways that a new heavy neu-     particle and two forward jets.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    tral gauge boson may arise from extensions to the sm , in order to allow for comparisons with current results from atlas / cms and to highlight the usefulness of the vbf topology in @xmath11 searches with large qcd backgrounds as well as those with clean signatures , we use the seqsm as a benchmark and consider @xmath11 decays to @xmath6 and @xmath7 . in the vbf @xmath19 study , we focus on the final state where both @xmath20 leptons decay to hadrons ( @xmath21 ) since it provides the largest branching fraction ( 42% ) and is expected to produce better sensitivity compared to final states with semi - leptonic decays of @xmath20 leptons .",
    "the dominant sources of background in these studies are production of top quark pairs ( @xmath22 ) and @xmath23/@xmath24 bosons with associated jets ( referred to as @xmath23+jets , @xmath24+jets , and more generally as @xmath25+jets ) .",
    "the @xmath23+jets background is characterized by two real prompt leptons from the @xmath23 boson decay in addition to two jets , either from initial state radiation ( processes of order @xmath26 ) or from pure electroweak processes .",
    "the w+jets background is only important in the @xmath6 study and satisfies the selection criteria when a jet is misidentified as a @xmath21 and two additional jets ( e.g. initial state radiation ) satisfy the vbf criteria .",
    "background from @xmath22 events is usually accompanied by one or two b quark jets , in addition to real prompt leptons .",
    "signal and background samples were generated with madgraph ( v2.2.3 ) @xcite , considering proton - proton beams with @xmath27 tev .",
    "pythia ( v6.416 ) @xcite was used for the hadronization process , while delphes     production cross - section as a function of mass .",
    "the vbf @xmath11 production cross - section excees the production via the dy process at approximately @xmath28 tev .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    ( v3.3.2 ) @xcite was used to simulate detector effects ( cms configuration was used ) .",
    "the @xmath23/@xmath24(@xmath29/@xmath30)+jets background events were generated with up to four associated jets , inclusive in @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the mlm algorithm @xcite was used for jet matching and jet merging , which optimizes two variables ( xqcut and qcut ) related to the jet definition .",
    "the xqcut variable defines the minimal distance between partons at madgraph level .",
    "the qcut variable defines the minimum energy spread for a clustered jet in pythia . in order to determine appropriate xqcut and qcut values ,",
    "the distribution of the differential jet rate was required to smoothly transition between events with @xmath33 and @xmath34 jets .",
    "the jet matching and merging studies resulted in an optimized xqcut of 20 and qcut of 40 . at the madgraph level",
    ", leptons were required to have a @xmath35 gev and @xmath36 , while jets were required to have a minimum @xmath37 gev and @xmath38 .",
    "the signal samples were produced considering only pure electroweak production of @xmath11 and two associated jets : @xmath39 with @xmath40 . as mentioned above",
    ", we considered the seqsm as our benchmark scenario for historical reasons and allowed decays to either @xmath6 or @xmath7 .",
    "we scanned @xmath41 ranging from 1 tev to 5 tev , in steps of 250 gev .",
    "figure  [ fig : xsections ] shows the @xmath12 production cross - section as a function of mass for both `` standard '' dy - like production , which are consistent with the values used by atlas and cms in  @xcite , and pure electroweak vbf production .",
    "the vbf @xmath11 production cross - section surpasses that of the dy process at approximately @xmath42 tev , making vbf processes     l c ccriterion & @xmath43 & @xmath44 +   + @xmath45 & @xmath46 & @xmath46 + @xmath47 & @xmath48 gev & @xmath49 gev + @xmath50 & @xmath51 & @xmath51 + @xmath52 & @xmath53 & @xmath53 + @xmath54 & @xmath55 & @xmath55 + n(b - jets ) & 0 & 0 + @xmath56 & @xmath57 gev & ",

    "for completeness , it is noted the cross - sections for vbf higgs production in  @xcite have also been reproduced as a cross - check of the madgraph calculations for vbf @xmath12 .",
    "the vbf topology is characterized by two high @xmath3 forward jets ( @xmath71 ) , with large pseudorapidity gap , located in opposite hemispheres of the detector , and tev scale dijet invariant masses .",
    "similar to the vbf susy and vbf dm searches in  @xcite , an advantage of this topology is the reduction of the qcd multijet background particularly important in searches with @xmath20 leptons suffering from relatively high jet@xmath72 misidentification rates .",
    "however , a vbf @xmath11 search differs fundamentally from those analyses in the following ways : @xmath73 since susy particles must be produced in pairs under the assumption of r - parity conservation , the vbf processes considered in  @xcite occur through t - channel diagrams , while vbf @xmath11 proceeds via s - channel ( figure  [ fig : feyn ] ) , resulting in lower average @xmath3 for the jets ; @xmath74 vbf @xmath75 contains leptons with higher @xmath3 ( tev scale ) .",
    "these features mean different search philosophies , including e.g. the @xmath21 identification strategy and the choice of the experimental trigger .",
    "for example , while the vbf susy searches profit from the use of a vbf dijet + @xmath76 trigger to select low @xmath3 leptons without bias , the high @xmath3 leptons from @xmath11 decays allow the use of single lepton or dilepton triggers to maintain unbiased vbf dijet and @xmath76 cuts targeting the lower jet @xmath3 and @xmath76 values typical of s - channel vbf @xmath11 production . while discovery of either type of new physics would be an incredible achievement , the difference between t - channel and s - channel provides     distribution of the highest @xmath3 jet for the sum of sm backgrounds and the vbf @xmath18 signal benchmark point with @xmath77 tev.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    a clean approach to reveal the difference between the two models .",
    "the event selection criteria used in both the @xmath43 and @xmath44 channels is summarized in table  [ tab : selections ] . in the @xmath43 channel ,",
    "we select events with two oppositely charged @xmath21 candidates ( @xmath78 ) , each with @xmath79 gev and @xmath80 2.5 , that must be well separated in @xmath81 space by requiring @xmath82 .",
    "the requirement on @xmath83 bounds the selected @xmath21 candidates to be within the tracker acceptance region of the detector .",
    "contamination from @xmath22 events is largely suppressed by vetoing events containing jets , with @xmath84 gev , identified as b quarks . to further reduce possible contamination from qcd multijet and @xmath85 + jets backgrounds",
    ", events must have @xmath86 gev . in table",
    "[ tab : selections ] we refer to the aforementioned criteria as central selections . in order to impose a stringent vbf selection aimed at the reduction of qcd multijet and background processes with two jets from initial state radiation ( e.g. @xmath87 order @xmath88 ) , a minimum @xmath3 threshold of 50 gev",
    "is used for the leading and sub - leading jets .",
    "the selected jets and @xmath21 candidates must be well separated by requiring @xmath89 .",
    "the @xmath90 distribution of the highest @xmath3 jet for the signal and sum of sm backgrounds is shown in figure  [ fig : jeteta ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : deta ] displays the difference in pseudorapidity , @xmath91 , between the two leading jets . the requirement that the two jets be in opposite hemispheres of the detector is imposed with @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "finally , the invariant mass of the dijet pair , @xmath68 , must be greater than 1 tev .",
    "similar event selection criteria is used for the @xmath44     between the two leadings jets for the sum of sm backgrounds and the vbf @xmath18 signal benchmark point with @xmath77 tev.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    channel .",
    "nevertheless , this channel has significantly lower background contamination in comparison to the @xmath43 channel .",
    "this is due to a much smaller jet@xmath94 misidentification rate ( at least one order of magnitude smaller ) .",
    "the low jet@xmath94 misidentification rate allows for lower @xmath3 thresholds on @xmath95 and jet candidates .",
    "muons and jets are required to have @xmath96 gev .",
    "the less stringent vbf selection in the @xmath44 channel allows us to regain signal acceptance .",
    "although we have assumed the atlas and cms dimuon triggers allow for 30 gev cuts on @xmath97 ( mostly to allow for observation of a @xmath23 mass peak ) , it should be noted that the average transverse momentum of muons from @xmath11 decays is @xmath98/2 , independent of the @xmath11 boost from the vbf selection , and thus the muon @xmath3 thresholds can be increased without affecting the projected signal significance .",
    "other sets of topological variables were considered , such as the cos@xmath99 and @xmath100 variables used in the atlas and cms searches to reduce the w+jets background and targeting the back - to - back nature of the lepton pair  @xcite . however , since the @xmath11 produced in vbf processes is boosted in order to balance the momentum of the vbf jets , those variables are sub - optimal in these studies . on the other hand ,",
    "the w+jets background is greatly reduced owing to the vbf criteria .",
    "the reconstructed dilepton mass is proposed as the main variable to discriminate against known sm backgrounds .",
    "an enhancement in the tails of the mass distribution would indicate the presence of new physics at the lhc . while the reconstructed dimuon mass @xmath101 in vbf @xmath102 shows up as a narrow bump",
    ", the visible ditau mass ( i.e. @xmath103 ) in vbf @xmath18 does not pr-     distributions in dy and vbf production of @xmath18 with @xmath77 tev.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    oduce a narrow `` peak '' since the @xmath6 system decays into neutrinos .",
    "for this reason , the reconstructed invariant mass distribution in the @xmath43 channel , @xmath104 , utilizes the reconstructe @xmath76 and is defined based on equation  [ eq : mt ] .",
    "@xmath105    figure  [ fig : dyandvbfditaumass ] shows the @xmath104 distributions in dy and vbf production of @xmath18 with @xmath77 tev .",
    "since the neutrinos from the @xmath106 decay are back - to - back in dy processes , there is a cancellation of missing momentum which does not allow the reconstruction of the true mass , on average ( i.e. @xmath107 tev in @xmath108 ) . on the other hand , and as noted above , since the @xmath11 produced in vbf processes is boosted in order to balance the momentum of the vbf jets , the neutrinos are not back - to - back and thus results in improved reconstructed mass scale and resolution . figure [ fig : massditau ] shows the expected @xmath104 background and signal distributions using events satisfying the @xmath43 cuts in table  [ tab : selections ] .",
    "the signal is overlaid on top of the stacked backgrounds .",
    "figure  [ fig : massdimuon ] shows a similar distribution , except for the @xmath7 channel .",
    "the last bin in these distributions represent the overflow bin .",
    "the bulk of the background distribution resides at low mass , while the signal dominates in the tails of the distribution .",
    "distribution for the main backgrounds and three chosen signal benchmark points , after applying the final event selection criteria.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "similar to the atlas and cms searches , we utilize a shape based analysis of the reconstruced mass distribution , using the rootfit @xcite toolkit , to construct a binned likelihood following the test statistic based on the profile likelihood ratio .",
    "reasonable systematic uncertainty is considered in order to calculate projected significance . however , since the background rates are small at high mass values where the signal dominates , the poisson uncertainty on the yields dominate the total uncertainty . the dominant sources of systematics are expected to be the uncertainty on @xmath21 identification ( 6% based on @xcite ) , vbf selection efficiency ( 20% based on  @xcite ) , and the uncertainty due to the variations in the yields and mass shapes arising from the choice of parton distribution function ( 15% based on  @xcite ) .",
    "based on these considerations , a 25% total systematic uncertainty on the signal and background yields is a reasonable choice .",
    "systematic uncertainties are incorporated via nuisance parameters following the frequentist approach .",
    "a local p - value is calculated as the probability under a background only hypothesis to obtain a value of the test statistic as large as that obtained with a signal plus background hypothesis . the significance @xmath109 is then determined as the value at which the integral of a gaussian between @xmath109 and @xmath110 results in a value equal to the local p - value .    figure  [ fig : results ] shows the expected signal significance , considering an integrated luminosity of 30 fb@xmath8 .",
    "the proposed @xmath11 searches using the vbf topology can provide expected significances greater than 5@xmath9 ( 3@xmath9 ) for @xmath12 masses up     distribution for the main backgrounds and three chosen signal benchmark points , after applying the final event selection criteria.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    to 2.2 ( 2.9 ) tev and 3.4 ( 4.0 ) tev in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 channels , respectively .",
    "using 1.69@xmath9 to define an exclusion bound at 95% confidence level , the projected exclusion bounds are @xmath111 tev and @xmath112 tev in the @xmath43 and @xmath44 channels .",
    "these projected exclusion bounds can be compared to the most recent atlas and cms results , which currently exclude @xmath12 masses below 2.1 tev and 3.75 tev in @xmath18 and @xmath102 channels , respectively .",
    "the proposed searches for tev scale neutral gauge bosons produced via vbf processes can increase the current atlas and cms bounds on @xmath41 by about 70% in the @xmath6 decay mode and 25% in @xmath7 decay mode . we stress that while it s clear the @xmath7 channel has better discovery potential for models with universal couplings of the @xmath11 boson to the leptons , the improved reach in the @xmath6 decay mode is particularly important in models with enhanced couplings to third - generation fermions ( e.g. topcolor - assisted technicolor  @xcite ) and can be derived from figure  [ fig : results ] by appropriately rescaling the vbf @xmath11 cross - section .",
    "the main result of this paper is that probing heavy neutral gauge bosons @xmath11 produced through vbf processes can be a key methodology to complement current searches for tev scale particles at the lhc . in the context of the seqsm , it is shown that the vbf production cross - section surpasses that of the more standard dy process at approximately @xmath28 tev , which makes     and vbf @xmath102 searches , using a shape based statistical analysis of the reconstructed mass distribution , as a function of @xmath41 .",

    "show that the requirement of a dilepton pair combined with two high @xmath3 forward jets with large separation in pseudorapidity and with large dijet mass is effective in reducing sm backgrounds .",
    "the expected exclusion bounds ( at 95% confidence level ) are @xmath111 tev and @xmath112 tev in the @xmath43 and @xmath44 channels , respectively , assuming 30 fb@xmath8 of 13 tev data from the lhc .",
    "the use of the vbf topology to search for massive neutral gauge bosons increases the discovery reach at the lhc , with expected significances greater than 5@xmath9 ( 3@xmath9 ) for @xmath12 masses up to 2.2 ( 2.9 ) tev and 3.4 ( 4.0 ) tev in the @xmath43 and @xmath44 channels . we have developed this paper for the seqsm benchmark .",
