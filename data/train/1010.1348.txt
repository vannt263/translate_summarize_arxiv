    "high-@xmath0 jets can be initiated either in a short - distance interaction among partons in high energy collisions such as @xmath1 , @xmath2 , in the dis @xmath3 , the @xmath4 annihilation and via electroweak ( or new physics ) processes .    in this framework , we compute the average ( charged ) multiplicity of a jet initiated by a heavy quark . for this purpose ,",
    "we extend the modified leading logarithmic approximation ( mlla ) evolution equations @xcite to the case where the jet is initiated by a heavy ( charm , bottom ) quark .",
    "the average multiplicity of light quark jets produced in high energy collisions can be written as @xmath5 ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 are defined in section [ sec : kivar ] ) , where @xmath8 is the anomalous dimension that accounts for soft and collinear gluons in the double logarithmic approximation ( dla ) @xmath9 , in addition to hard collinear gluons @xmath10 or single logarithms ( sls ) , which better account for energy conservation and the running of the coupling constant @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the inclusive @xmath12-distribution of particles inside a jet has been computed at mlla accuracy in the limiting spectrum approximation  @xcite , _ i.e. _ assuming an infrared cutoff @xmath13 equal to @xmath14 ( for a review , see also @xcite ) .",
    "mlla corrections , of relative magnitude @xmath15 with respect to the leading double logarithmic approximation ( dla ) , were shown to be quite substantial  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we also included corrections of order @xmath16 , that is next - to - next - to - leading or next - to - mlla ( nmlla ) .",
    "lastly , both observables , the average multiplicity and the inclusive @xmath12-distribution are computed under the assumption of local parton hadron duality ( lphd ) as hadronization model @xcite .",
    "as known from jet calculus for light quarks , the evolution time parameter determining the structure of the parton branching of the primary gluon is given by ( for a review see @xcite and references therein ) @xmath17 where @xmath12 is the transverse momentum of the gluon emitted off the light quark , @xmath18 is the virtuality of the jet ( or jet hardness ) , @xmath19 the energy of the leading parton , @xmath20 is the emission angle of the gluon ( @xmath21 ) , @xmath22 the total half opening angle of the jet being fixed by experimental requirements .",
    "let us define in this context the variable @xmath6 as @xmath23 .",
    "the appearance of this scale is a consequence of angular ordering ( ao ) of successive parton branchings in qcd cascades @xcite .",
    "the corresponding evolution time parameter for a jet initiated by a heavy quark with energy @xmath19 and mass @xmath24 appears in a natural way and reads @xmath25 @xcite , which for collinear emissions @xmath21 can also be rewritten in the form @xmath26 with @xmath27 ( see fig.[fig : qsplit ] ) .",
    "an additional comment is in order concerning the ao for gluons emitted off the heavy quark . in ( [ eq : qtheta ] ) , @xmath28 is the emission angle of the primary gluon @xmath29 being emitted off the heavy quark .",
    "now let @xmath30 be the emission angle of a second gluon @xmath31 relative to the primary gluon with energy @xmath32 and @xmath33 the emission angle relative to the heavy quark ; in this case the _ incoherence _ condition @xmath34 together with @xmath35 ( the emission angle of the second gluon should still be larger than the dead cone ) naturally leads ( [ eq : qtheta ] ) to become the proper evolution parameter for the gluon subjet ( for more details see @xcite ) . for @xmath36 , the standard ao ( @xmath37 )",
    "is recovered .",
    "therefore , for a massless quark , the virtuality of the jet simply reduces to @xmath38 as given above .",
    "the same quantity @xmath39 determines the scale of the running coupling @xmath11 in the gluon emission off the heavy quark .",
    "it can be related to the anomalous dimension of the process by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the number of active flavours and @xmath42 the number of colours .",
    "the variation of the effective coupling @xmath11 as @xmath43 over the heavy quarks threshold has been suggested by next - to - leading ( nlo ) calculations in the @xmath44 scheme @xcite and is sub - leading in this frame . in this context @xmath45",
    "will be evaluated at the total number of quarks we consider in our application .",
    "the four scales of the process are related as follows , @xmath46 where @xmath47 corresponds to the limiting spectrum approximation @xcite .",
    "finally , the dead cone phenomenon imposes the following bounds of integration to the perturbative regime @xmath48 which now account for the phase - space of the heavy quark jet .",
    "the last inequality states that the minimal transverse momentum of the jet @xmath49 is given by the mass of the heavy quark , which enters the game as the natural cut - off parameter of the perturbative approach .",
    "the system of qcd evolution equations for the heavy quark initiated jet , corresponding to the process described in fig.[fig : qsplit ] is found to read @xcite @xmath50    where @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are defined in @xcite . as a consistency check , upon integration over @xmath55 of the dla term in eq.([eq : nqhter ] ) , the phase space structure of the radiated quanta reads @xmath56(\\ln z\\tilde q).\\ ] ] notice that the lower bound over @xmath57 in ( [ eq : dconesimple ] ) ( @xmath55 in ( [ eq : nqhter ] ) ) can be taken down to  0 \" ( @xmath58 in ( [ eq : nqhter ] ) ) because the heavy quark mass plays the role of collinear cut - off parameter .",
    "working out the structure of ( [ eq : nqhter ] ) and ( [ eq : nghter ] ) , we obtain the rough difference between the light and heavy quark jet multiplicities , which yields , @xmath59n_q,\\quad n_q\\propto\\exp2\\sqrt{\\frac{\\tilde y}{\\beta_0}}.\\ ] ] it can be seen that ( [ eq : nqdiff ] ) is exponentially increasing because it is dominated by the leading dla energy dependence of @xmath60 . according to ( [ eq : nqdiff ] )",
    ", the gap arising from the dead cone effect should be bigger for the @xmath61 than for the @xmath62 quark at the primary state bremsstrahlung radiation off the heavy quark jet .",
    "the approximated solution of the evolution equations leads to the rough behaviour of @xmath63 in ( [ eq : nqdiff ] ) , which is not exact in its present form .",
    "that is why , in the following , we use the numerical solution of the equations ( [ eq : nqhter ] ) and ( [ eq : nghter ] ) .    in this study",
    "we advocate the role of mean multiplicities of jets as a potentially useful signature for @xmath61-tagging and new associated physics @xcite when combined with other selection criteria . in fig.[fig : nq ] , we plot as function of the jet hardness , the total average jet multiplicity ( @xmath64 ) , which accounts for the primary state radiation off the heavy quark ( @xmath65 ) together with the decay products from the final - state flavoured hadrons ( @xmath66 ) , in the form @xmath67 .",
    "moreover , the flavour decays constants @xmath68 and @xmath69 @xcite are independent of the hard process inside the cascade , such that @xmath66 can be added in the whole energy range . after accounting for the weak decay multiplicities , it turns out that the @xmath61 quark jet multiplicity becomes slightly higher than the @xmath62 quark jet multiplicity , although both remain suppressed because of the dead cone effect .",
    "computing the single inclusive @xmath71 distribution requires the definition of the jet axis .",
    "the starting point of our approach consists in considering the correlation between two particles ( h1 ) and ( h2 ) of energies @xmath72 and @xmath73 which form a relative angle @xmath28 inside one jet of total opening angle @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "weighting over the energy @xmath73 of particle ( h2 ) , this relation leads to the correlation between the particle ( h = h1 ) and the energy flux , which we identify with the jet axis @xcite .",
    "thus , the correlation and the relative transverse momentum @xmath12 between ( h1 ) and ( h2 ) are replaced by the correlation , and transverse momentum of ( h1 ) with respect to the direction of the energy flux . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cdf - nmlla ] @xcite , we report measurements over a wide range of jet hardness , @xmath75 , in @xmath76 collisions at @xmath77  tev  @xcite , together with the mlla predictions of @xcite and the nmlla calculations , both at the limiting spectrum ( @xmath78 ) and taking @xmath79  mev ; the experimental distributions suffering from large normalization errors , data and theory are normalized to the same bin , @xmath80 .",
    "cdf preliminary results for the inclusive @xmath81 distribution at various hardness @xmath18 in comparison to mlla and nmlla predictions at the limiting spectrum ( @xmath82 ) ; the boxes are the systematic errors.,width=370,height=340 ]    the hadronic @xmath12-spectrum inside a high energy jet is determined including corrections of relative magnitude @xmath83 with respect to the mlla , in the limiting spectrum approximation .",
    "the results in the limiting spectrum approximation are found to be in impressive agreement with measurements by the cdf collaboration , unlike what occurs at mlla , pointing out small overall non - perturbative contributions .",
    "the mlla predictions prove reliable in a much smaller @xmath81 interval . at fixed jet hardness ( and thus @xmath84 ) ,",
    "nmlla calculations prove accordingly trust - able in a much larger @xmath85 interval .",
    "thus , our present work focusing on the differences of the average charged hadron multiplicity between jets initiated by gluons , light or heavy quarks could indeed represent a helpful auxiliary criterion to tag such heavy flavours from background for jet hardness @xmath86 gev .",
    "notice that we are suggesting as a potential signature the _ a posteriori _ comparison between average jet multiplicities corresponding to different samples of events where other criteria to discriminate heavy from light quark initiated jets were first applied .",
    "fig.[fig : nq ] plainly demonstrate that the separation between light quark jets and heavy quark jets is allowed above a few tens of gev with the foreseen errors of the experimentally measured average multiplicities of jets .",
    "the single inclusive @xmath12-spectra inside a jet is determined including higher - order @xmath16 ( i.e. nmlla ) corrections from the taylor expansion of the mlla evolution equations and beyond the limiting spectrum , @xmath87 .",
    "the agreement between nmlla predictions and cdf preliminary data in @xmath76 collisions at the tevatron is impressive , indicating very small overall non - perturbative corrections and giving further support to lphd @xcite ."
