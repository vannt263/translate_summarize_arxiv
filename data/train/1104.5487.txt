    "rapid advances in the development of space - borne detectors @xcite that might be operational in the relatively near future are also expected @xcite .",
    "as pointed out long ago @xcite , cosmological phase transitions in the early universe might produce an imprint in the form of a stochastic background of relic gravity waves .",
    "these would arise as a result of the collision or turbulent motion of bubbles of `` true vacuum '' expanding and eventually filling the metastable vacuum in a cosmological first order phase transition @xcite",
    ". the resulting signal might be large enough to be detectable by the next generation gravity wave search experiments , providing a unique window on the early cosmological history of the universe @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of the gravity wave background arising from a first order cosmological phase transition is controlled by two physical properties of the phase transition itself : ( a ) the amount of false vacuum energy liberated during the phase transition  in other words , the latent heat associated with the transition ; and ( b ) the bubble nucleation time scale , which gives a measure of how rapidly the phase transition occurs relative to the early universe hubble expansion rate @xcite .",
    "the resulting gravity wave normalization and spectral peak can be estimated as a function of these two physical quantities .",
    "detailed analytical @xcite and numerical @xcite studies exist that relate the two parameters to the predicted spectrum , in particular for the case of detonations , where the speed of the bubble wall is larger than the speed of sound ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of the opposite case of deflagration ) .",
    "one class of models where a strongly first order phase transition is a necessary ingredient is electroweak baryogenesis @xcite . in the presence of b - violating electroweak sphalerons in the standard model(sm ) and sources of cp - violation beyond those of the ckm",
    "cp violating phase , the electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) can produce a sufficiently large baryon number density to explain the observed baryon asymmetry ( for recent studies see e.g. @xcite . to prevent the washout of the produced asymmetry",
    ", the phase transition must be strongly first order , thus necessarily producing gravity waves .",
    "interestingly , the typical frequencies at which gravity waves from the ewpt are red - shifted today falls in the milli - hertz to hertz range , where the expected sensitivity of the space - based interferometer lisa is maximal .",
    "the search for a gravity wave relic from the ewpt is therefore especially intriguing and promising ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .    from a particle physics perspective",
    ", the determination of the details of an ewpt depends on the calculation of the finite - temperature effective action @xmath1 as a function of the background bosonic fields  denoted generically here as @xmath2  that are present in the theory . in the case of the sm , lattice computations and the lep lower bound on the mass of the higgs boson",
    "imply that electroweak symmetry breaking in a sm universe occurs through a cross - over transition@xcite . to obtain a strongly first - order ewpt as needed for both electroweak baryogenesis ( ewb ) and the associated relic gravity waves",
    ", one must augment the sm scalar sector by the addition of new scalar fields , such as a second higgs su(2@xmath3 doublet as in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite or a real singlet in minimal extensions of the sm scalar sector ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "electroweak bubble nucleation occurs when a combination of the one of these new fields and the neutral component of the sm higgs doublet becomes non - zero .",
    "the properties of relic gravity waves produced by bubble collisions then follows from the behavior of @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "the most theoretically robust computations of the effective action are performed using non - pertrubative ( lattice ) methods .",
    "given the cost of such computations , however , this approach is not feasible for exploring ewpt dynamics in a variety of beyond the standard model ( bsm ) scenarios .",
    "consequently , one must resort to perturbation theory which , in turn , requires introduction of gauge - fixing . as recognized",
    "long ago @xcite , perturbative computations of the effective potential  and more generally @xmath4 $ ]  generically lead to a gauge - dependent function .",
    "physical quantities like the latent heat or the bubble nucleation rate should not , however , exhibit any gauge dependence .",
    "in fact , general arguments imply that the critical temperature @xcite and the bubble nucleation rate @xcite are gauge independent .",

    "a non - trivial gauge - dependence can enter perturbative computations from an inconsistent truncation of the perturbative expansion@xcite . in the context of sphaleron - induced baryon number washout , following on earlier work by refs .",
    "@xcite , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite how a consistent , systematic order - by - order approach can yield a gauge - invariant perturbative result .",
    "however , most of the remaining literature on the topic of the ewpt , including the context of gravity wave production and of baryogenesis relevant here , appears to suffer from gauge - dependence ( typically , perturbative calculations of ewpt - relevant quantities have been performed in the landau gauge ) .",
    "apart from the point of principle , the question then arises as to the quantitative impact that this gauge artifact has upon predictions of observable quantities .    in the present study",
    ", we address this question as it pertains to computations of gravitational wave spectra from a first order ewpt . to that end",
    ", we consider the simplest model involving scalar fields charged under a gauge group : the abelian higgs model , also known as the coleman - weinberg or scalar qed model .",
    "we then resort to a class of gauges known as @xmath0 ( or renormalizable ) gauges , and we calculate the effective potential at finite temperature including its explicit dependence on the parameter @xmath5 .    studying the abelian higgs model has two clear advantages .",
    "first , its parameter space is small and easily analyzed .",
    "second , and more importantly , one may calculate its effective potential using a gauge - invariant hamiltonian approach@xcite whose results can be compared with those obtained from the gauge - dependent approach .",
    "we then calculate quantities relevant to the character , strength and duration of the ewpt both in the @xmath0 gauges ( including landau gauge ) and in the gauge - invariant approach , and systematically compare the results .",
    "we find that the gauge choice may have a dramatic impact , amounting to several orders of magnitude , on the inferred gravity wave spectrum , and even on the first- or second - order character of the phase transition itself .",
    "we also observe that the landau gauge results closely matches , at least for the abelian higgs model , the results using the explicitly gauge - invariant hamiltonian formulation .",
    "this situation is perhaps not surprising , given the arguments in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see below ) .",
    "we caution however that this conclusion might not be easily generalizable to non - abelian gauge theories and that even in the abelian higgs model , a gauge - invariant resummation of higher - order terms that would otherwise spoil the convergence of the perturbative expansion remains to be developed . to underscore the importance of the latter problem , we study the impact of including the daisy resummation \" in @xmath0 gauges . we find that in the landau gauge , inclusion of the resummation typically reduces the overall amplitude of the gw spectrum compared to the gauge - invariant but un - resummed result .",
    "we then comment on strategies to tackle these issues in non - abelian models ( such as the standard model or its supersymmetric extensions )  including those of ref .",

    "we begin in section  [ sec : gaugedep ] with the explicit calculation of the gauge - dependence of the effective potential , at both zero and finite temperature , for the abelian higgs model . in section",
    "[ sec : gwparams ] , we explain the calculations required to predict gravitational wave spectra and other physical observables related to the phase transition . finally , we present our results and conclusions in sections  [ sec : results ] and  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we are concerned here with an abelian higgs model encompassing a complex singlet higgs field with lagrangian @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the standard electromagnetic tensor and covariant derivative , respectively .",
    "the potential @xmath9 is @xmath10 the tree - level vacuum expectation value is @xmath11 , and the bare higgs mass at the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) is @xmath12 .    in order to perform perturbative calculations , we must add gauge - fixing and ghost terms to the lagrangian . in the @xmath0 gauge , these are @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the grassmann - valued ghost field , and where we have split @xmath15 into its real and imaginary components : @xmath16 .",

    "note that in landau gauge ( @xmath20 , fixing @xmath21 ) , the ghost field completely decouples from the theory .    to include finite - temperature corrections , we must go to ( at least ) one - loop order in the effective potential . at zero - temperature ,",
    "the calculation of the one - loop effective potential proceeds by taking the trace of the inverse propagators for each particle .",

    "however , the value of @xmath18 that minimizes the one - loop effective potential _ is not _",
    "gauge invariant .",
    "for the particular case of the abelian higgs model , fischler and brout @xcite defined an effective potential from the vacuum - to - vacuum @xmath29-matrix element without resorting to the introduction of sources , a procedure that contrasts with the conventional definition in terms of the legendre transform of the source - dependent generating functional , @xmath30 $ ] . in this context , the free - energy \" is minimized by a spacetime - independent background field only in the landau gauge , whereas in other gauges the minimizing fields must carry a spacetime dependence .",
    "consequently , only in the landau gauge does the minimum of the effective potential in the absence of sources characterize the presence or absence of symmetry - breaking . for",

    "we observe that the daisy resummation of higher - order contributions was not considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , and it is not immediately clear how one would do so .",
    "consequently , when comparing results in the two approaches , we will not include the daisy resummation in the lagrangian formulation .",

    "the nucleation rate goes roughly as @xmath69 , where the constant of proportionality can be found largely on dimensional grounds . for electroweak scales , this gives a transition temperature determined by @xmath70 ( see e.g.  ref .",

    "we first observe that the transition occurs in the range @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the lowest temperature at which the original , high - temperature phase exists and @xmath74 is the temperature at which the minima of the potential in the two phases are degenerate .",

    "@xcite the gravity wave spectrum ( more precisely , the gravity wave energy density per frequency octave ) from collisions at production is parameterized by @xmath91 where the two exponents , obtained from fits to the numerical results , are set to @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the spectrum is redshifted according to @xmath94 @xmath95 with the functions @xmath96 and @xmath97 depending on the bubble wall velocity @xmath98 ( and hence implicitly on the relative energy density difference @xmath61 ) according to the following parameterization ( again as given in ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath99 @xmath100 finally , we employ the following parameterization for the bubble wall velocity @xcite @xmath101 valid in the limit of interest here of strongly first order phase transitions .",
    "note that the overall amplitude scales as @xmath102 for @xmath103 , so it can be changed by several orders of magnitude by choosing a model with a different @xmath87 .",
    "in the most basic model without any additional fields , four parameters determine the effective potential : the tree - level higgs mass @xmath52 , the tree - level vev @xmath104 , the gauge coupling @xmath105 , and the renormalization scale @xmath106 .",
    "we vary only the first two of these , keeping @xmath107 gev and @xmath108 tev fixed .",
    "we include phase transition calculations using the gauge - invariant hamiltonian formalism of boyanovsky et al .",
    "@xcite without resummation , shown in the figures as solid arrows .    in order to generate a fairly strong first - order phase transition , the gauge boson mass must be relatively large .",

    "all four properties  the transition temperature , the values of @xmath18 corresponding to the minima of the phases , the relative change in energy density , and the transition duration  heavily depend upon the choice of gauge .",
    "we also show the impact of including the daisy resummation , as discussed above .",
    "three broad features emerge from these figures .",
    "the results obtained with the hamiltonian formulation most closely match the results of landau gauge ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "however , the match is not exact .",
    "most significantly , the hamiltonian approach yields a small but measurable increase in the critical and transition temperatures .",
    "second , at @xmath54 , there can exist significant shifts in the gw - wave relevant parameters due to the inclusion of the daisy resummation .",
    "generally , one finds that the values of @xmath61 are decreased while @xmath115 are increased due to the inclusion of the resummation , implying a reduced amplitude and higher peak frequency in the gw spectrum .",
    "this significant departure from the fully gauge - invariant results ( albeit within the landau gauge ) suggests that developing a gauge - invariant daisy resummation procedure will be essential for obtaining physically realistic predictions .",
    "third , the dependence on @xmath5 can both exacerbate these differences and lead to new phase structures that are clearly unphysical artifacts of the gauge choice .",
    "for example , for @xmath116 gev ( fig .",
    "[ fig:120mh ] ) , the phase transition becomes second - order at high @xmath5 , so the change in energy density goes to zero and @xmath117 goes to infinity . a change in gauge",
    "can also lead to secondary minima and secondary transitions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : doubletrans ] ) . in figs .",
    "[ fig:10mh][fig:120mh ] , we always perform calculations for the transition with the largest change in vev , even when this transition happens after initial symmetry breaking . this leads to the discontinuities in figs .",
    "[ fig:35mh ] and  [ fig:120mh ] .",
    "given the unphysical nature of these artifacts , we do not discuss them further but simply point out the danger in this context of attempting to draw physical inferences from a gauge - dependent calculation .",
    "an example of multiple phase transitions in the same model . here ,",
    "@xmath118 gev , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 .",
    "since the existence of the secondary phase transition is gauge - dependent , it is clearly non - physical . ]    finally , we present our calculations for various gravitational wave spectra in figures  [ fig : gw10][fig : gw120_resum ] .",
    "we make comparisons of the hamiltonian approach and @xmath0 gauges without daisy resummation in figures  [ fig : gw10][fig : gw120 ] , and include the effects of resummation in figures  [ fig : gw10_resum][fig : gw120_resum ] . again",
    ", landau gauge and the hamiltonian approach produce very similar results .",
    "however , a change in the gauge parameter produces very large changes in both the calculated amplitude and peak frequency of the wave . without daisy resummation it does not appear possible , or at least feasible , to determine which way this change will manifest without doing the full numerical calculation . with resummation ,",
    "an increase in the gauge parameter tends to make the phase transition less strongly first - order , thereby decreasing amplitude and increasing the peak frequency of the resulting spectrum .",
    "we have thus far presented numerical calculations of strongly first - order phase transitions and spectra of the resultant gravitational waves in the abelian higgs model both for various values of the gauge parameter @xmath5 and in two gauge - invariant formalisms .",
    "the gauge - invariant hamiltonian formalism closely matches landau gauge .",
    "we find that small changes in @xmath5 can produce large changes in calculated physical quantities , implying that attention to gauge invariance in gw computations is essential for reaching physically meaningful predictions .",
    "moreover , we find that in the lagrangian formalism , the result may be significantly affected by inclusion of the daisy resummation , a conclusion similar to what has been observed in the context of sphaleron rate computations@xcite .    from these observations ,",
    "we conclude that the use of a non - gauge - invariant framework and the neglect of daisy resummations in computations of gw spectra for non - abelian phase transitions are likely to lead to physically unreliable predictions . at present",
    ", it appears that the generalization of gauge - invariant perturbative methods applicable in the abelian higgs model to non - abelian spontaneously broken theories is not straightforward",

    "first , one can compute thermodynamic quantities of interest ( such as @xmath61 and @xmath68 ) as well as the bounce action with monte carlo methods , thereby circumventing the gauge problem at the outset while including all higher - order effects ( including those entering daisy resummed perturbation theory ) by construction .",
    "the results would undoubtedly be the most reliable theoretically , but this approach is unlikely to be practically feasible for surveying a wide variety of models or exploring wide regions of parameter space for models like the mssm . as an alternative , following ref .",

    "the latter approach is relatively straightforward conceptually , but computationally involved , as one must go to at least second order in the loop expansion .",
    "it appears particularly challenging in the case of the tunneling rate computation . from a more formal side",
    ", it may be possible to construct a gauge - invariant hamiltonian formalism for spontaneously - broken non - abelian gauge theories .",
