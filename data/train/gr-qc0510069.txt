    "the analysis of the properties and behavior of gravity in higher dimensions has become a major area of research in recent years , motivated in particular by developments in string theory . among others , the einstein - gauss - bonnet ( egb ) gravity theory has been singled out as relevant to the low energy string limit @xcite . the egb theory is a special case of lovelock s theory of gravitation @xcite , whose lagrangian is a linear combination of euler densities continued from lower dimensions .",
    "lovelock s theory gives equations involving up to second order derivatives of the metric , and has the same degrees of freedom as ordinary einstein theory @xcite .",
    "a number of solutions to the egb equations , many of them relevant to the development of the @xmath5 correspondence @xcite , are known , among them a variety of black holes in asymptotically euclidean or @xmath6 spacetimes @xcite .",
    "these were found mostly because they are highly symmetric . analyzing their linear stability ,",
    "however , confronts us with the complexity of the egb equations , since the perturbative terms break the simplifying symmetries of the background metric . to be more specific , we consider spacetimes that admit locally a metric of the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the line element of an @xmath3dimensional manifold @xmath2 of constant curvature @xmath9 or @xmath10 .",
    "linear perturbations around ( [ b ] ) can be conveniently classified , following the scheme proposed in @xcite , into tensor , vector , and scalar perturbations . the @xmath11 case @xmath12 gives , for appropriate @xmath13 and @xmath14 , cosmological solutions , as well as higher dimensional schwarzchild black holes .",
    "the stability of these solutions under tensor perturbations was studied in @xcite .",
    "a complete classification of solutions to the egb equation with line element ( [ b ] ) and @xmath9 or @xmath10 , together with a case by case stability study under tensor perturbations appears in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we extend the analysis in @xcite to vector and scalar perturbations .",
    "the methods we employ here are rather different from the analytic computations carried out in @xcite and @xcite for arbitrary dimension .",
    "the complexity of the computations involved in the study of vector and scalar perturbations forced us to develop alternative approaches .",
    "explicit expressions were worked out for space - time dimensions @xmath15 , and their @xmath3dependence was then interpolated . as a result",
    ", we obtained expressions which are low degree ( @xmath16 ) polynomials in @xmath17 , correct at least up to the highest physically interesting space - time dimension ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "nevertheless , we conjecture that they are correct for arbitrary @xmath17 .",
    "this is because only the lower values of @xmath17 ( up to @xmath19 ) are required to obtain the @xmath3dependence , and higher values appear as  predictions \" .",
    "moreover , it is clear that a purely analytic derivation of the equations for general @xmath17 should lead to expressions of the form presented here , and this gives further support to our conjecture .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ vsp ]",
    "we give the general solution of the egb equations with metric ( [ b ] ) , then we introduce vector and scalar perturbations following @xcite . in section [ vegb ]",
    "we study the stability of ( [ b ] ) under vector perturbations in egb gravity . as was done for tensor perturbations in @xcite",
    ", we show that the problem reduces to obtaining a lower bound for the spectrum of a schrdinger operator which , in spite of its complexity , turns out to be an @xmath20deformation @xcite of a much simpler operator .",
    "section [ segb ] is devoted to scalar perturbations .",
    "a step by step guide for constructing the potential of the associated schrdinger operator is given , since its general expression for arbitrary dimensions is extremely long and has a complicated dependence on the parameters .",
    "this makes a general analysis of the stability problem under scalar type perturbations practically impossible . on the other hand ,",
    "since the procedure given in this paper allows for the explicit construction of the potential for any particular choice of dimension @xmath17 , and other parameters of the theory , our results can easily be used in the analysis of particular classes of situations . as an example and application",
    ", we analyze schwarzschild - like five dimensional black holes and find a scalar instability of low mass , which is absent in einstein gravity .",
    "section [ conc ] contains the conclusions .",
    "the einstein - gauss - bonnet ( egb ) equations in the vacuum case are given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the cosmological constant , @xmath23 the spacetime metric , @xmath24 the einstein tensor and @xmath25 the quadratic gauss - bonnet tensor .",
    "these are the first three in a tower @xmath26 of tensors of order @xmath27 in @xmath28 given by lovelock in @xcite .    here",
    "we consider static spacetimes satisfying ( [ lovelock ] ) with a metric of the form ( [ b ] ) .",

    "the non - zero components of the riemann and ricci tensors , and the ricci scalar for a metric of the form ( [ b ] ) are given in @xcite .",
    "inserting these in ( [ lovelock ] ) we find that ( [ b ] ) solves the egb equation ( [ lovelock ] ) if @xcite @xmath33 and @xmath34 is a solution of @xmath35 this implies that , @xmath36 } \\ ; \\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath37 picks a root of the quadratic polynomial @xmath38 .",

    "we also note @xcite that if @xmath44 the condition @xmath45 reduces to @xmath46 whereas for @xmath47 , @xmath45 is equivalent to @xmath48 in @xcite , the space - times ( [ b])-([f])-([p])-([f1 ] ) were classified by studying the intersections of the curves @xmath38 and @xmath49)-([f])-([p])-([f1 ] ) were studied in @xcite .",

    ", we were not able to find test functions with negative  energy \" expectation values , there seems to be no scalar instability in these cases ( see , e.g. , figure 6 ) , although a more systematic study has not been completed yet .",
    "note however that a low mass instability under _ tensor _ mode perturbations was previously found in six dimensional schwarzschild - tangherlini - egb black holes @xcite .",
    "the study of the linear stability of static solutions to the einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity with spatial slices of the form @xmath215 , @xmath2 an @xmath3manifold of constant curvature @xmath4 can be carried out using the techniques introduced by kodama and collaborators . in the classification of kodama ,",
    "@xcite , general linear perturbations can be constructed from appropriate harmonic tensors on @xmath2 , and classified accordingly into tensor , vector and scalar modes .",
    "tensor perturbations were analyzed in @xcite , the other modes being the subject of this paper .",
    "we proved that , as happens in higher dimensional gr stability problems @xcite , the perturbation equations can be reduced to a single stationary schrdinger - like equation on a function of the radial coordinate , the potential being different for the scalar and vector cases . finding the linearized egb equation and the appropriate integrating factors leading to",
    "the equivalent schrdinger problem is far more difficult in the vector and scalar modes than in the tensor modes .",
    "however , after performing the calculations in spacetime dimensions five to eleven , the dimension dependence of the equations was interpolated by formulas that we believe are valid beyond this range and that reproduce the expected @xmath183 ( gr ) results .",
    "+ in the vector case , we were able to prove stability using an s - deformation argument .",
    "the same result is found in higher dimensional gr . in the scalar case , however , we found an instability that is absent in gr @xcite .",
    "although the complexity of the potential prevents us from drawing general conclusions , the egb analogous to 5d schwarzschild black holes are shown to be unstable below a critical mass .",
    "a similar result was found in @xcite , where it was proved that low mass 6d spherical , asymptotically euclidian black holes are unstable .",
    "these results are relevant to tev scale quantum gravity scenarios , where those black holes are predicted to be produced in high energy collisions @xcite .",
    "+ the potentials that we have obtained have a number of applications beyond the study of the stability of black holes and cosmological solutions . among the most immediate ones",
    "are the analysis of black hole uniqueness , quasi normal modes @xcite , and the analysis of stability of naked singularities in egb gravity .",
