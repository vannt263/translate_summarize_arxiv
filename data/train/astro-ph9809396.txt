    "the analogy between filtering and object detection in point distributions was recognized since more than 25 years ( e.g. , yashin 1970 , snyder 1972 , rubin 1972 ) .",
    "recent astronomical applications are given in , e.g. , dalton et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , kawasaki et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and postman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . in the latter project ( palomar distant cluster survey , pdcs ) clusters of galaxies are detected and their redshifts and richnesses are estimated by maximizing the excess of the galaxy number counts as a function of angular coordinate and apparent magnitude with respect to the foreground and background galaxy distribution . in the following both distributions",
    "are referred to as ` background ' distribution .",
    "the algorithm is based on the assumption that the statistics are dominated by the background galaxy counts . in this ` high - background approximation ' the expected large numbers of galaxies ensure the validity of a gaussian approximation of the corresponding likelihood function ( central limit theorem ) which is maximized to find the clusters and their basic parameters .",
    "it can be shown that this type of maximization corresponds to the minimization of the error - weighted squared differences between observed and modeled data ( method of least squares , e.g. , barlow 1996 , p.93 ) .",
    "all counting errors are attributed to poisson noise in the background .",
    "the method outlined above is optimized in finding distant clusters where the approximations seem to be appropriate . in the following",
    "we describe a generalization of the pdcs filter where no _ a priori _ information about the contrast of the cluster distribution with respect to the background distribution is needed .",
    "we replace the gaussian approximation of the likelihood function by an exact expression based on local poisson distributions with position - dependent mean intensities guided by the projected cluster number density profile and by the luminosity function . a similar approach based on binned data",
    "was developed independently by kawasaki et al .",
    "their finally used likelihood function , however , differs from the one derived in the present paper .",
    "the aim of the present investigation is to study a mathematically exact and general likelihood filter which can be further optimized and then applied to the detection and characterization of isolated galaxy clusters located in comparatively uniform background galaxy fields .",
    "we plan to apply the method to galaxy fields centered around flux - limited samples of x - ray sources , e.g. , to the rosat - eso - flux - limited x - ray ( reflex ) cluster catalogue ( bhringer et al .",
    ", in preparation )",
    ". the algorithm can be applied , however , to a much broader class of detection problems .",
    "the reflex clusters have measured redshifts up to @xmath0 ; a few exceptional cases have @xmath1 .",
    "the bulk of the data is located in the range @xmath2 . within the reflex project",
    ", the filter can be used to compute statistical significances of cluster detections , and to estimate redshifts and richnesses of the optical counterparts .",
    "the redshift estimates could further support those cluster redshifts which are obtained spectroscopically with only small numbers of cluster galaxies .",
    "the richness estimates could give more information about selection effects introduced by the complex x - ray / optical survey process of the reflex project .",
    "the approach is based on the assumption that the spatial and the magnitude distributions of the galaxies located in the direction of clusters can be modeled by a marked inhomogeneous poisson point process .",
    "the resulting likelihood function is given in a compressed analytic form using the concept of the likelihood ratio statistics ( sect.[s_gm ] ) .",
    "it is shown that the pdcs filter can be recovered in cases where background number counts dominate the statistic ( appendixb ) .",
    "some practical notes on the application of the filter are given in sec.[s_pc ] .",
    "in sect.[s_fp ] the performance of the general method is illustrated by analyzing simulated data to measure possible statistical biases of the derived numerical estimators ( very often maximum likelihood estimators are not unbiased ; see , e.g. , ripley 1991 , sect.4 , and barlow 1996 , p.84 ) and by analyzing subsamples of the cosmos galaxy catalogue to test the methods under more realistic survey conditions .",
    "the results are summarized and the deviations from the idealized model assumptions are discussed in sect.[s_cr ] .",
    "all computations assume pressureless friedmann - lematre world models with the hubble constant , @xmath3 , in units of @xmath4 , a negligible cosmological constant , and the deceleration parameter @xmath5 .",
    "the spatial distribution of the galaxies can be regarded as an inhomogeneous but in principle more or less random pattern of points , i.e. , as a realization of a point process in mathematical terminology ( neyman & scott 1952 , layzer 1956 , see also neyman 1961 and references therein ) .",
    "the point process can be considered either as a random set of discrete points or as a random measure , counting the number of points in a given region ( method of counts - in - cells ) .",
    "the points may be distributed in a three - dimensional volume , in a two - dimensional patch on the celestial sky , in a magnitude space , etc .",
    "all distributions with random locations of points and with local density parameters guided by a _ nonrandom _ variable fall into the category of inhomogeneous poisson point processes .",
    "this is the case for the inhomogeneous galaxy distribution seen in the direction of one galaxy cluster where the local more or less radial - symmetric variation of the projected galaxy number density profile plus the uniform background field are determined by the intensity @xmath6 .",
    "the inhomogeneous poisson point process is well - known in the theory of point processes ( see , e.g. , cressie 1993 , p.650 and references therein ) . if we replace the deterministic variation of the density parameter by a",
    "variable we enter the field of doubly stochastic poisson processes ( cox processes , see , e.g. , stoyan , kendall , & mecke 1995 , p.154 ) which are the general types of point processes to characterize large - scale distributions of galaxies ( e.g. , a gaussian random field combined with local poisson point processes ) .",
    "let @xmath7 be one spatial realization of a point process .",
    "the @xmath8 points , all with different coordinates , are distributed within the total volume @xmath9 .",
    "a useful quantity with a simple interpretation and a direct relation to powerful analytical tools provided by the theory of point processes is the local janossy density , @xmath10 : after multiplication of @xmath11 with the product of the volume elements @xmath12 it gives the probability that in the total volume @xmath9 there are exactly @xmath8 points in the process , one point in each of the @xmath8 distinct infinitesimal half - open regions @xmath13 .",
    "the janossy density may be regarded as the likelihood @xmath14 of the realization , ignoring  as usual  the principle differences between probability density functions and sample functions : @xmath15 assume that the number of galaxies observed per unit solid angle depends only on the spatial coordinate @xmath16 and gives the intensity @xmath6 .",
    "more complicated models where also the magnitudes of the galaxies are taken into account are discussed below in the context of marked point processes ( see sec.[ss_impp ] ) . the intensity @xmath6 is considered as the @xmath16-dependent density parameter of an inhomogeneous poisson process .",
    "the janossy density and thus the likelihood function of the inhomogeneous poisson point process can be derived directly by using the machinery of probability generating functionals and khinchin measures ( daley & vere - jones 1988 , p.498 ) .",
    "the application of this formalism offers , however , the possibility to derive likelihood functions for more complex point processes , e.g. , multiple stochastic point processes which might be interested for many cosmological applications . a guideline through the basic equations of the formalism",
    "is given in appendixa .",
    "for inhomogeneous poisson point processes this standard formalism leads to the logarithmic likelihood ( see also snyder 1975 , karr 1986 , and appendixa ) @xmath17 equation ( [ l1 ] ) can also be found in a more heuristic way . as already mentioned above , the quantity @xmath18",
    "@xmath19 @xmath12 may be regarded as the probability of finding exactly one point in each of the infinitesimal volume elements @xmath20 , ( case a ) , whereas outside of these regions no further points are present , ( case b ) .",
    "these events are independent , due to the independence properties of the poisson process .",
    "the probabilities for ( a ) are given by @xmath21 ( for each individual point ) , and the probability for ( b ) is given by the avoidance or void probability function , @xmath22 .",
    "the integration extents over the volume @xmath9 reduced by the sum of the infinitesimal volume elements , @xmath23 , which can be neglected due to their small size so that , in total , the integration extents over the complete volume @xmath9 ( stoyan & stoyan 1992 , p.258 ) .      in order to generalize the model described above note that galaxy distributions can also be regarded as realizations of _ marked _ spatial point processes , each consisting of locations of events in a bounded study region @xmath9 and associated measurements ( marks ) .",
    "typical marks , often found in cosmological applications are apparent magnitude , luminosity , mass , energy , color , morphological type , etc . in this case",
    "the realization of a marked point process is @xmath24 .",
    "we assume the absence of any segregation effects , i.e. , that the marks are independent - and - identically - distributed and are independent of the associated marginal spatial point process .",
    "define the point process by a counting measure on the product space @xmath25 of two intervals with , for example , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "the moment measures of a marked spatial point process are simple extensions of the moment measures of an ordinary spatial point process .",
    "the generalization of ( [ l1 ] ) to marked inhomogeneous poisson point processes is thus straightforward and is given by @xmath28 usually , @xmath29 can be factorized as @xmath30 @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the conditional density of the marks , so that the log - likelihood can be maximized separately for the parameters characterizing @xmath33 and @xmath34 .      in the case of finding clusters of galaxies using spatial and magnitude information @xmath29",
    "can not be factorized as can be seen from the model for the number of galaxies observed per unit area and per unit magnitude interval introduced by postman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , @xmath35 here , @xmath36 gives the differential magnitude number counts of the background galaxies , @xmath37 is the luminosity function ( e.g. , in the schechter prescription ) of one cluster shifted along the apparent magnitude scale in accordance with the given redshift parameter and superposed onto the background distribution , @xmath38 is the cluster angular surface number density profile as a function of the projected ( radial ) distance @xmath39 from the center of the cluster with the projected characteristic radius @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is a dimensionless parameter characterizing the intrinsic cluster richness .",
    "equation ( [ mux ] ) assumes a uniform , i.e. , unclustered background galaxy distribution , and that all clusters have the same luminosity function and the same spatial number density profile . for the model ( [ mux ] ) with given @xmath36 , and the normalization ( if the integrals do not diverge ) @xmath42 equation ( [ lm1 ] ) can be written as @xmath43 it is convenient to normalize likelihood functions using the concept of likelihood ratio statistics .",
    "further notes on the scope of adaptability of the likelihood ratio statistics , especially when not all random variables may be independent , can be found in sen & singer ( 1993 , p.72 ) .",
    "for the present situation where @xmath36 is assumed to be known the results do , however , not explicitly depend on the specific normalization . as a reference process in the denominator",
    "usually the homogeneous poisson process is chosen . in order to get a likelihood ratio where its maximization explicitly maximizes the contrast between cluster and background , an inhomogeneous poisson process with an @xmath39-independent density as given in ( [ mux ] ) for @xmath44 ( background model ) seems to be more appropriate .",
    "note that although the point distribution of this specific model is homogeneous in the spatial domain it is still inhomogeneous in the magnitude space .",
    "the corresponding log - likelihood is @xmath45 with this normalization the final log - likelihood ratio is @xmath46 the richness parameter @xmath41 is obtained from the relation @xmath47 , resulting in the condition : @xmath48 equations ( [ lr1 ] ) and ( [ lam1 ] ) can be used for the detection of clusters in the following way : in the first step , values for @xmath49 and @xmath40 are selected so that , for given functional forms of @xmath50 and @xmath51 , equation ( [ lam1 ] ) gives the corresponding richness parameter using standard numerical root finding algorithms ( see , e.g. , brent 1973 , sect.3 and 4 ) . in the second step , this @xmath41 value is inserted into ( [ lr1 ] ) where @xmath52 serves as a significance measure for the detected cluster candidate .",
    "the relations between the observed and the distant - independent values of the filter parameters are determined by the redshift @xmath53 and the chosen cosmological model . the final cluster redshift and richness values are thus fixed by the @xmath53 value with the highest log - likelihood ratio . from @xmath44 it can be deduced that for a general galaxy field , @xmath54 is the mode of the distribution of the logarithmic values of the likelihood ratios .",
    "the distribution is asymmetric with a long tail to larger @xmath52-values where the rich clusters are expected .",
    "approximations of the equations ( [ lr1 ] ) and ( [ lam1 ] ) are given in appendixb .",
    "for the application of the filter the intervals @xmath9 and @xmath55 in ( [ norm ] ) must be specified .",
    "the following computations assume the half - open @xmath39- and @xmath56-ranges @xmath57 in equations ( [ interv ] ) @xmath58 is the halo or cutoff radius defined by @xmath59 for @xmath60 , and @xmath61 for @xmath62 .",
    "the bright and the faint - end limit of the apparent magnitudes of the sample galaxies are @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively . for radial - symmetric cluster profiles , equations ( [ interv ] ) , ( [ mux ] ) , and ( [ norm ] ) give a second estimator for the cluster richness , @xmath65 with the specific choice ( [ interv ] ) , @xmath66 is the difference between the total number of galaxies , @xmath67 , seen in the direction of the cluster , and the number of background galaxies , @xmath68 , expected for the cluster area determined by @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , @xmath66 is a statistical measure of the number of cluster galaxies , @xmath70 , detected in the magnitude range @xmath55 above the background distribution .",
    "the estimator gives richnesses which depend on cluster redshift .",
    "note the difference between @xmath41 defined as a parameter characterizing the intrinsic cluster richness by equation ( [ mux ] ) without any constrains on the intervals @xmath9 and @xmath55 , and @xmath66 defined as an estimator of the cluster richness through equation ( [ estrich ] ) under the constrains ( [ interv ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ estrich ] ) not only shows that estimates of cluster richnesses obtained with ( [ lam1 ] ) or ( [ estrich ] ) are biased .",
    "the equation also offers a new way to circumvent the more complicated estimation of @xmath41 by solving condition ( [ lam1 ] ) .",
    "richnesses obtained with ( [ estrich ] ) are , however , not obtained with the maximum likelihood principle .",
    "therefore , the combination of @xmath66 with ( [ lr1 ] ) does not necessarily yield consistent maximum likelihood values .",

    "the last equality in ( [ estrich1 ] ) uses the normalization ( [ norm ] ) separately for the radial and for the magnitude profile : @xmath78 the equations ( [ estrich1 ] ) can also be used to correct @xmath66 for redshift biases .",
    "finally , it should be noted that @xmath63 must be bright enough to include the brightest galaxy of the sample .",
    "the following computations illustrate the basic properties of the likelihood filter . the model is given by the equations ( [ lr1 ] ) , ( [ lam1 ] ) , ( [ interv ] ) , ( [ estrich1 ] ) , and ( [ incr ] ) . all numerical simulations and reductions",

    "although not essential for the application of the likelihood filter , knowledge of the relation between the traditional abell cluster richness , @xmath95 , and the not observable intrinsic cluster richness , @xmath41 , defined by equation ( [ mux ] ) is helpful in order to understand the efficiency of cluster detection and cluster characterization .",
    "isolated clusters with known redshifts , equatorial coordinates , and richnesses , superposed onto an homogeneous background galaxy distribution , are simulated with simple monte carlo methods in relativistic spacetime .",
    "the galaxies have apparent magnitudes in the range @xmath96mag .",
    "the background number counts , @xmath36 , are guided by polynomial fits to the differential distributions collected by metcalfe et al .",

    "the analysis concentrates on the abell richness classes @xmath98,0,1 , and 2 because most of the clusters we want to study have these comparatively low richnesses .",
    "the nonlinearity between the @xmath95 and the @xmath41 richnesses as seen in fig.[f_rich ] is introduced by the richness - dependency of @xmath99 , that is , the apparent magnitude of the 3rd - brightest cluster galaxy ( scott effect ) .",
    "the large scatter of the individual richness estimates is mainly caused by the large scatter of the @xmath99 values .",

    "the @xmath100 range of the @xmath52 values obtained for pure background fields without superposed galaxy clusters is indicated by the vertical error bar at @xmath44 .",
    "as expected , the log - likelihood values increase with increasing cluster richness and decreasing cluster redshift .",
    "the simulations suggest that if the clusters have the same luminosity function and radial number density profile as used in the likelihood filter then the method would detect all clusters in the cosmos galaxy catalogue with redshifts @xmath101 and richness @xmath102 or @xmath103 ( abell richness class 0 ) on significance levels @xmath104 . for larger redshifts ,",
    "however , only clusters with larger richnesses can be detected .",
    "the richness estimates @xmath41 obtained with equation([lam1 ] ) and the richness estimates @xmath71 obtained with ( [ estrich1 ] ) are compared in fig.[f_lambda0 ] . as shown in sect.[s_pc ] , @xmath41 estimates are always redshift - dependent when they are computed within fixed magnitude intervals .",
    "they give the number of cluster galaxies above the background field : this number decreases with increasing @xmath53 .",
    "contrary to this , @xmath71 estimates are corrected for the effect of the redshift - dependent magnitude range of the cluster galaxies .",
    "these estimates are almost constant over the given @xmath53 interval .",
    "the accuracies of richness estimates are always limited by principle problems concerning the determination of the cluster memberships and by the small numbers of detectable galaxies in distant clusters .",
    "these problems are illustrated in the figs.[f_lambda1 ] and [ f_lambda2 ] .",
    "the richness estimates @xmath71 are computed for clusters at different redshifts and intrinsic cluster richnesses @xmath41 .",
    "the number of simulated clusters is constant per unit redshift interval . as expected , the random errors of the @xmath71 estimates increase significantly for poor clusters at high @xmath53 .",
    "moreover , cluster richnesses are systematically overestimated for samples with high @xmath53 . only for cluster samples with small @xmath53 and high",
    "@xmath41 we can expect unbiased estimates which are directly linked to the intrinsic cluster richnesses .",
    "the following tests are devoted to studies concerning possible systematic redshift errors which might be inherent for the derived method . in order to detect @xmath53 biases without the disturbing effects of the discreteness noise ,",
    "the analysis begins with the simulations of clusters with high intrinsic richnesses , @xmath105 .",
    "we regard these simulations as some kind of numerical integration of the relevant equations . at the end of this paragraph",
    ", the results from the simulations of clusters with low richnesses are discussed .",
    "figures[f_lhc ] show the likelihood values obtained for four rich clusters simulated at the redshifts @xmath106 , 0.14 , 0.20 , and 0.26 .",
    "as already shown in the preceding sections , the magnitude and redshift ranges of these simulations give galaxy distributions as selected from the cosmos galaxy catalogue .",
    "for all redshifts the log - likelihood curves in fig.[f_lhc ] peak close to the true cluster redshifts ( indicated on top of each panel ) . for intermediate @xmath53 values , the comparatively high symmetry of the curves around the correct cluster redshift indicates the absence of large systematic @xmath53 errors . for small and for large redshifts",
    "the curves get more asymmetric .",
    "this might be taken as a hint to possible increasing systematic @xmath53 errors when the method is applied to comparatively nearby or distant clusters .",
    "the asymmetries , however , do not significantly affect the positions of the maxima of the log - likelihood curves and thus of the derived redshifts .",
    "for example , the differences , @xmath107 , between the true redshifts and the likelihood redshifts are @xmath108 for the extreme redshifts",
    "@xmath106 and @xmath109 , and do not exceed @xmath110 for all cases studied so far . for very rich clusters , the @xmath107 values do not show any @xmath53-dependent trends , and are of the order of the expected numerical accuracies .",
    "we thus conclude that numerical studies under ideal conditions ( high richness , and background distribution assumed to be known ) give no indications for possible @xmath53-dependent biases of the locations of the maxima of the log - likelihood curves .",
    "the situation changes for poor clusters and when the background number counts must be estimated from the sample itself .",
    "the comparison of the likelihood redshifts with the true cluster redshifts is shown for different intrinsic richnesses in fig.[f_zlikzsim ] . for high richnesses no systematic redshift errors",
    "are detected , supporting the results of the analyses described above .",
    "for poor clusters with , e.g. , @xmath111 ( i.e. , clusters close to the detection limit at @xmath112 ) a systematic overestimation of @xmath53 at high redshifts is found .",
    "this is mainly caused by the small number of cluster galaxies detected for poor clusters at high @xmath53 leading to a systematic undersampling of the bright end of the cluster luminosity function and of the outskirts of the projected cluster profile .      before we describe the results obtained with the likelihood filter on observed data",
    "a few comments regarding some practical limitations are given .",
    "the derivation of the likelihood filter rests on the assumption of an homogeneous and isotropic spatial distribution of the background galaxies . in mathematical terminology",
    "this involves the validity of first - order motion invariance , i.e. , the invariance of the mean intensity of galaxies in the study area outside the cluster region under spatial translations and rotations . in many practical situations the observed data",
    "do not fulfill these requirements .    on small scales , the galaxy field",
    "is strongly clustered so that comparatively large solid angles are needed to reduce biases in the background determination . on large scales",
    ", extreme care must be taken to achieve homogeneous sampling of the galaxy field .",
    "the latter aspect is important for the analysis of galaxy catalogues obtained from mosaics of digitized schmidt plates where the effects of vignetting , desensitization , and small errors in magnitude zero - points may introduce artifical fluctuations in the observed galaxy field , especially when galaxy distributions obtained from different plates are combined .",
    "for the application of the likelihood filter to observed data it is thus necessary to extract galaxy fields on areas which are not too small to be affected by galaxy number density fluctuations and which are not too large to be affected by artifical plate - to - plate variations .",
    "tuckey s median polishing offers a robust way to detect large - scale deviations from first - order motion invariance in point distributions .",
    "the algorithm successively subtracts medians out of rows of gridded data ( number counts in quadratic cells ) , then columns , then rows , then columns , and so on , accumulating them in ` row ' , ` column ' , and ` all ' registers , and leaves behind the table of residuals .",
    "the convergence of this procedure is discussed in kemperman ( 1984 ) .",
    "an illustration of the algorithm is given in appendixc .",
    "we use this algorithm after transforming the equatorial object coordinates into hammer - aitoff equal - area coordinates to flag regions by searching for cells in the row and in the column registers which significantly deviate ( @xmath113 formal background noise ) from the mean galaxy background distribution and exclude the corresponding plates from further analyses .",
    "the results obtained with median polishing sometimes strongly depend on the specific orientation of the row and column axes .",
    "therefore , we apply the algorithm using three different orientations . for each orientation ,",
    "median polishing usually converges after three to five iterations .",
    "the iteration stops when the relative changes between two successive iteration steps are less than one percent .    in fig.[f_zcom ]",
    "the redshift estimates obtained with the likelihood filter on subsamples of the cosmos galaxy catalogue are compared to cluster redshifts obtained from spectroscopic observations .",
    "the central cluster coordinates and the cluster redshifts are taken form the reflex catalogue ( bhringer et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "the test sample includes 43 reflex clusters observed among others within the eso key programme ( e.g. , guzzo et al . 1995 ) .",
    "these clusters have redshifts determined with eight to 20 cluster galaxies and are thus well - suited as redshift references . in addition , the presence of comparatively strong x - ray signals from these sources and the absence of active galaxies further support the existence of real clusters in these areas .",
    "the test sample is not a representative subsample of the complete reflex catalogue .",
    "it is biased to larger redshifts because the complete reflex sample includes also a large number of nearby clusters .",
    "all cosmos galaxies with @xmath114mag ( after correction for saturation effects and galactic extinction ) located within spherical regions of about two degrees radius around the x - ray cluster positions are selected .",
    "after median polishing and careful determination of the bright and of the faint magnitude limits of the galaxies in each study region , typically 10000 galaxies ( background @xmath115 cluster ) remain per cluster target .    for 28 clusters from the list of 43 test clusters the filter detects a maximum in the likelihood functions within the redshift range @xmath116 .",
    "the parameters of the likelihood filter are the same as used in the simulations .",
    "the corresponding @xmath117 values are shown in fig.[f_zcom ] .",
    "for the remaining 15 test clusters no redshifts could be determined , either because of their weak statistical significance @xmath118 ( two cases ) or because no local maximum was detected ( 13 cases ) .",
    "these redshift incompletenesses increase with increasing redshift from 20 to 25 percent for @xmath119 to 53 percent for @xmath120 .",
    "however , the redshift distribution of the test clusters was constructed to be almost redshift - independent so that the given incompleteness values must be weighted with the _ a priori _ probabilities for the presence of clusters of galaxies within different redshift intervals ( multiplication formula for probabilities ) .",

    "whereas the errors of the generalized method can be explained by the incomplete sampling of the filter profiles for poor clusters at high @xmath53 , the errors of the pdcs filter can not be judged in an easy way .",
    "reasons for the descrepancies between the two methods are still not clear because of the complexity of the pdcs approximations .",
    "nevertheless , it seems that if one uses the exact mathematical equations , as does the generalized method , corrections like the ` cluster signal correction ' of the pdcs filter are not necessary .    it",

    "the final question concerns the validity of the chosen assumptions used to derive the likelihood filters .",
    "problems caused by deviations of the spatial distribution of the background galaxies from the assumed uniform distribution were already discussed in sect.[ss_rfod ] .",
    "further systematic errors in the derived cluster redshifts and richnesses arise when the luminosity functions and the number density profiles of the likelihood filter do not match with the corresponding functions of the observed clusters . as an example , tabs.[t_mrco ] and [ t_mrc ]",
    "illustrate the effects of false filter parameter values @xmath126 ,",

    "the ` correct ' cluster parameters , derived for the case when @xmath50 and @xmath51 of the filter exactly match with the corresponding cluster functions , are shown as reference in the tables within the small boxes .",
    "the ranges of the filter parameters are clearly far beyond the variations expected for realistic cases .",
    "nevertheless , the results given in tabs.[t_mrco ] and [ t_mrc ] illustrate the stabilizing effect of using both spatial and magnitude information to derive the cluster @xmath53 and @xmath71 .",
    "for some parameter combinations , however , the systematic errors are amplified .",
    "it is also seen that false values of the cutoff radius , @xmath58 , give larger systematic @xmath53 and @xmath71 errors compared to false values of the core radius , @xmath40 .",
    "one might expect that the stronger effect of @xmath40 on truncated cluster profiles would also translate into higher sensitivities of @xmath53 and @xmath71 on this filter parameter .",
    "the conclusion , however , neglects the effects of errors in the background number counts .",
    "the number of the background galaxies expected for the cluster area scales with @xmath127 so that small errors in @xmath58 have a large effect .    in many clusters of galaxies",
    "the presence of substructures may lead to significant systematic errors in the estimated cluster richnesses and redshifts . in order to simulate unrelaxed clusters in a stage of formation by merging of subunits we approximate such configurations by superposing two cluster models at close separation which seems to describe observed mergers quite well ( e.g. , briel et al .",
    "1991 , bhringer et al .",
    "the two components are supposed to have the same redshift and therefore the same number density profiles and luminosity functions , but varying richness ratios are chosen .",
    "tab.[t_substr ] summaries the results obtained for different distances @xmath128 ( in units of @xmath40 ) between the centers of the two components , and for different ratios , @xmath129 , of the richnesses .",
    "the table gives for the combined system the estimated richnesses ( numerator ) normalized to the richness of the main component , and the estimated redshifts ( denominator ) .",
    "as expected , the maximum likelihood filter gives for small @xmath128 the approximate sum of the two richnesses , converging for large @xmath128 to the richness of the main component .",
    "fortunately , the redshifts are almost uneffected by this type of substructure .",
    "the effects of different faint - end slopes of the luminosity functions ( not shown here ) are significantly smaller compared to the effects mentioned above and can in general be neglected for the distant clusters .    to summarize , the likelihood filter described here , is shown to be a useful method to detect and to characterize distant clusters of galaxies .",
    "clusters with comparatively low richnesses can be detected out to fairly large distances .",
    "reliable redshift and richness estimates , can , however , only be obtained for the more nearby , richer , and isolated systems .",
