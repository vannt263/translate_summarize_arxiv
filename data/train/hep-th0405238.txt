    "many important examples can be presented : the @xmath8-model , with @xmath9 , is the prototype of theories having topological solitons ( kinklike solutions ) connecting two minima . in this case",

    "the deformation prescription is powerful .",
    "the conditions under which our procedure [ see ref.@xcite ] holds are maintained if we consider a function for which the contra - domain is an interval of @xmath48 , that is , if we take @xmath67 . in this case , however , the inverse transformation ( engendered by @xmath68 ) can only be applied for models where the values of @xmath13 are restricted to @xmath69 .",
    "we illustrate this possibility by asking for a deformation that leads to a model of the form needed in ref .",
    "@xcite , described by a `` semi - vacuumless '' potential , in contrast with the vacuumless potential studied in ref .",
    "consider the new deformation function @xmath70 , acting on the potential @xmath9 .",
    "the deformed potential is @xmath71 which is depicted in fig .  1 .",
    "the kinklike solution is @xmath72\\ , .\\ ] ] the deformed potential ( [ dpm ] ) engenders the required profile : it has a minimum at @xmath73 $ ] and another one at @xmath74 .",
    "it is similar to the potential required in ref .",
    "@xcite for the existence of dimension bubbles . the bubble can be generated from the above ( deformed ) model , after removing the degeneracy between @xmath3 and @xmath74 , in a way similar to the standard situation , which is usually implemented with the @xmath8 potential , the undeformed potential that we have used to generate ( [ dpm ] ) .",
    "an issue here is that such bubble is unstable against collapse , unless a mechanism to balance the inward pressure due to the surface tension in the bubble is found . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the mechanism used to stabilize the bubble requires another scalar field , in a way similar to the case of non topological solitons previously proposed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "this naturally leads to another scenario , which involves at least two real scalar fields .",
    "the deformation procedure can be extended even further , by relaxing the requirement of @xmath18 being a bijective function , under certain conditions .",
    "suppose that @xmath18 is not bijective but it is such that its inverse @xmath33 ( which exists in the context of binary relations ) is a multi - valued function with all branches defined in the same interval @xmath75 . if the domain of definition of @xmath33 contains the interval where the values of the solutions @xmath21 of the original potential vary , then @xmath76 are solutions of the new model obtained by implementing the deformation with @xmath18 .",
    "however , one has to check out whether the deformed potential @xmath77/(f^{\\prime}(\\phi))^2 $ ] is well defined on the critical points of @xmath18 .",
    "in fact , this does not happen in general but occurs for some interesting cases .",
    "consider , for example , the function @xmath78 ; it is defined for all values of @xmath13 and its inverse is the double valued real function @xmath79 , defined in the interval @xmath80 .",
    "if we deform the @xmath8 model with this function we end up with the potential @xmath81 .",
    "the deformed kink solutions are given by @xmath82 with @xmath21 replaced by the solutions ( @xmath83 ) of the @xmath8 model , which reproduce the known solutions of the @xmath35 theory .",
    "the important aspect , in the present case , is that the @xmath84-kink corresponds to field values restricted to the interval @xmath85 which is contained within the domain of definition of the two branches of @xmath86 .",
    "the fact that the @xmath35 model can be obtained from the @xmath8 potential in this way is interesting , since these models have distinct characteristics .",
    "notice that the critical point of @xmath18 at @xmath87 does not disturb the deformation in this case ; this always occur for potentials having a factor @xmath88 , since the denominator of @xmath89 is canceled out .",
    "one can go on and apply this deformation to the @xmath35 model ; now , one finds the deformed potential @xmath90 with solutions given by @xmath91/2}}\\ , , \\ ] ] corresponding to kinks connecting neighboring minima ( located at @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath37 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 ) of the potential , which is illustrated in fig .",
    "2 . we can repeat the procedure for the potential @xmath96 , to obtain a sequence of soluble polynomial potentials , all having exact kinklike solutions .",
    "this result should be contrasted with ref .",
    "@xcite , which shows that it is in general hard to find solutions when the model includes higher - order power in the scalar field .",
    "the deformation implemented by the function @xmath97 can also be applied to a potential possessing lumplike solutions .",
    "consider the inverted @xmath8 potential @xmath98 , which has the lump solutions @xmath99 .",
    "the deformed potential , in this case , is given by @xmath100 this potential , which is also unbounded from below , vanishes for @xmath101 , has an absolute maximum at @xmath87 and local minima and maxima for @xmath102 and @xmath103 , respectively .",
    "3 shows a plot of this potential .",
    "again , the number of solutions duplicates using such a deformation : there are two solutions , @xmath104/2},$ ] which correspond to lumps running between the local minima and the lateral zeros of the potential , and also , @xmath105/2 } , \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;x\\leq 0 \\\\",
    "\\pm\\sqrt{\\left[1-{\\rm sech}(x)\\right]/2}\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;x\\geq 0 \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] which correspond to kinklike solutions connecting the minima @xmath106 this is a very unique example where non topological or lumplike solutions are deformed into topological or kinklike solutions .",
    "potentials which have a factor @xmath88 can also be deformed using the function @xmath107 , producing many interesting situations .",
    "in fact , suppose the potential can be written in the form @xmath108 this is always possible for all well - behaved potentials that vanish at both values @xmath109 , as shown by taylor expansion .",
    "then , the sin - deformation leads to the potential @xmath110,$ ] which is a periodic potential , the critical points of @xmath111 not causing any problem to the deformation process .",
    "the inverse of the sine function is the infinitely valued function @xmath112 , with @xmath113 and @xmath114 being the first determination of @xmath115 ( which varies from @xmath116 , for @xmath117 , to @xmath118 , when @xmath119 ) , defined in the interval @xmath85 .",
    "so to each solution of the original potential , whose field values range in the interval @xmath85 , one finds infinitely many solutions of the deformed , periodic , potential .",
    "consider firstly the @xmath8 model . applying the sin - deformation to it",
    ", one gets @xmath120 which is one of the forms of the sine - gordon potential .",
    "the deformed solutions thus obtained is given by @xmath121+k\\pi$ ] , which correspond to all the kink solutions ( connecting neighboring minima ) of this sine - gordon model .",
    "for example , the kink solutions @xmath122 , which connect the minima @xmath109 of the @xmath8 model in both directions , are deformed into the kinks @xmath123=2{\\rm arctan}(e^{\\pm x } ) - \\pi /2 $ ] ( which runs between @xmath124 and @xmath125 ) if one takes @xmath126 while , for @xmath127 , the resulting solutions connect the minima @xmath128 and @xmath129 of the deformed potential .",
    "this example can be readily extended to other polynomial potentials , leading to a large class of sine - gordon type of potentials .",
    "for instance , the @xmath35 model , @xmath130 , deformed by the sine function , becomes the potential @xmath131,$ ] which has kinklike solutions given by @xmath132/2}+k\\pi .\\ ] ] on the other hand , if one considers @xmath133 , which is unbounded below and supports kinklike solutions connecting the two inflection points at @xmath38 , one gets the potential @xmath134 which is solved by @xmath135    another particularly interesting situation where non topological solutions are deformed into topological solutions appears if one consider the inverted @xmath8 model , which presents lumplike solutions .",
    "the sin - deformation of the potential @xmath136 leads to the potential @xmath137 . in this case",
    ", the lump solutions of @xmath17 , namely @xmath138 , are deformed into @xmath139+k\\pi$ ] .",
    "consider the @xmath140-solution and take initially @xmath126 .",
    "as @xmath23 varies from @xmath141 to @xmath37 , @xmath142 goes from @xmath37 to @xmath95 , and @xmath143=2{\\rm arctan}(e^x)$ ] changes from @xmath37 to @xmath125 .",
    "if one continuously makes @xmath23 goes from @xmath37 to @xmath144 , then the deformed solution passes to the @xmath127 branch of @xmath115 , @xmath145+\\pi$ ] ( @xmath146 for @xmath147 ) , which varies from @xmath125 to @xmath148 as @xmath23 goes from @xmath37 to @xmath144 .",
    "thus , in this case , the lump solution @xmath149 of the inverted @xmath8 model is deformed in the kink of the sine - gordon model connecting the minima @xmath87 and @xmath150 . under reversed conditions ( taking the @xmath127 branch before the @xmath126 one ) , the lump solution @xmath151 leads to the anti - kink solution of the sine - gordon model running from the minimum @xmath150 to @xmath37 .",
    "the other topological solutions of the sine - gordon model are obtained considering the other adjacent branches of @xmath115 .",
    "in the former work on deformed defects @xcite we have stressed that the deformation procedure strongly depends on a function @xmath152 the deformation function , and there we have only considered bijective functions that obey @xmath153 in the present work , we have extended the deformation procedure with the inclusion of two new possibilities .",
    "first , we have considered deformation functions such that @xmath154 with @xmath155 which gives rise to new models such as the one recently considered in ref .",
