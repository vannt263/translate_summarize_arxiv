    "the decay of a metastable system through macroscopic quantum tunneling ( mqt ) has been studied in view of conceptual questions in quantum theory already in the 1980s @xcite .",
    "recently , it has regained new interest e.g.  in the context of quantum information processing in solid state based systems @xcite or as an effective detection mechanism in shot noise measurements @xcite . in corresponding electrical circuits ,",
    "current - biased josephson junctions are used as building blocks where the phase difference across a junction is the only relevant degree of freedom .",
    "the switching from the zero voltage state can then be visualized as the dynamics of a fictitious particle moving in a cubic potential such that at low temperatures the escape is dominated by quantum tunneling through the potential barrier .",
    "the crucial impact of the electromagnetic environment on this process has already been elucidated twenty years ago and then led to the development of the `` standard '' theory of quantum dissipative systems @xcite .    to date , the most powerful approach to calculate tunneling rates in dissipative systems is the so - called im@xmath0-method which relates the escape rate to the imaginary part of the free energy of an unstable system @xcite .",
    "basically , it can be seen as the generalization of the method to extract the lifetime of an unstable state from an imaginary part of its resonance energy @xcite .",
    "the theoretical predictions of the im@xmath0 theory including dissipation @xcite have been thoroughly tested in the 1980s in josephson junction circuits @xcite . in these studies",
    "the dominant effect of friction was due to dynamical environmental modes with ohmic spectral density .",
    "these modes generate at very low temperatures @xmath2 a rate enhancement proportional to @xmath3 as compared to the zero temperature limit @xcite .    in recent experiments with superconducting circuits for the implementation of quantum bits",
    ", the role of low frequency modes in the environmental spectrum has turned out to be substantial @xcite .",
    "bath modes that are inert on the typical experimental time scales or show only slow to moderate dynamics basically determine the dephasing time for oscillations of coherent superpositions of qubit states .",
    "in many cases , the corresponding noise spectrum displays a @xmath1 dependence over a broad frequency range attributed e.g.  to low frequency bistable charge fluctuators or electromagnetic fluctuations in control lines .",
    "in fact , @xmath1 noise has been known for years to be always present in mesoscopic devices @xcite . while detailed theoretical studies on its influence on the decoherence process in qubit devices have been given ,",
    "apart from some qualitative estimates , much less is known about its impact on mqt .    in this paper , we analyse mqt processes subject to noise from very low up to moderate frequencies .",
    "one may expect that quantum fluctuations in the bath are thus suppressed . for two model environments ,",
    "namely , a pure sluggish bath and an environment with @xmath1 characteristic , we show in detail to what extent this is actually true and how such a situation is incorporated into the im@xmath0 theory .",
    "these findings are further applied to a particular kind of mqt phenomenon which has been predicted @xcite and observed @xcite recently in the so - called quantronium circuit @xcite .",
    "this system , a superconducting circuit implementing a two - level system ( qubit ) with a readout by mqt , realizes an extension of the standard mqt scenario : it describes a fictitious particle with a spin-@xmath4 as an internal degree of freedom such that the zeeman splitting of its levels is position dependent ; in certain ranges of parameter space the zeeman levels cross under the barrier leading to spin flips while tunneling .",
    "the mqt rate is then substantially enhanced since effectively the particle has to penetrate a smaller barrier .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ imf ] we give a brief account of how tunneling rates in dissipative quantum systems are calculated within the im@xmath0 approach .",

    "the situation where a particle is initially confined in a metastable well and , as time elapses , leaves it due to thermal activation has been studied in a variety of systems @xcite . in the low temperature range below a certain crossover temperature @xmath12 ,",
    "however , quantum tunneling is known to be the dominant escape process . particularly , for an undamped system one has @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the frequency for oscillations around the minimum of the well ( plasma frequency ) .    to describe quantum barrier penetration in presence of a dissipative environment ,",
    "one starts from a system+reservoir model @xmath15 , where @xmath16 this model of a bath consisting of harmonic oscillators captures linear dissipation and equivalently mimics an environment with gaussian statistics . in the limit of a quasi - continuum of oscillators the effective influence of the heat bath",

    "it is based on the calculation of the free energy @xmath20 and thus of the partition function @xmath21 of an unstable system .",

    "further , due to the relation ( [ eq1 - 4 ] ) the influence kernel can be inferred from the classical damping kernel @xcite .",
    "the above path integral ( [ eq1 - 4b ] ) sums over all closed paths in the imaginary time interval @xmath30 $ ] . in case of sufficiently high potential barriers",
    "a semiclassical approximation applies so that the partition function is dominated by all periodic minimal action paths and gaussian fluctuations around them .",
    "it turns out that while fluctuations around a well minimum of a metastable potential are stable , those around a barrier top are not . as shown by langer @xcite ,",
    "due to an analytic continuation this gives rise to an imaginary contribution to the partition function @xmath31 which , even though it is exponentially small compared to the well contribution @xmath32 , must be taken into account to finally obtain the escape rate @xcite @xmath33 for the non - dissipative case and @xmath34 the method is completely equivalent to the wkb formalism and in other ranges its results have been verified by full dynamical approaches @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "its theoretical predictions have been thoroughly tested in comparison with experimental data over broad temperatures ranges and for various systems @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the method is that it enables us to calculate the decay rate of a metastable system from a purely thermodynamic quantity without considering the complicated real time dynamics .",
    "the archetypical form of a metastable potential is @xmath35 with a well located around @xmath36 and a barrier top at @xmath37 .",
    "the barrier height is @xmath38 and the well frequency @xmath14 .",
    "metastability justifying a semiclassical approximation to the partition function then means that @xmath39 . for a current - biased josephson junction",
    "the known tilted washboard potential for its phase takes locally the above form of a cubic surface .",
    "accordingly , in the low temperature domain @xmath40 is dominated by the so - called bounce orbit , a minimal action path that runs in the time interval @xmath30 $ ] through the inverted barrier potential @xmath41 with minimal action @xmath42 .",
    "the corresponding tunneling rate turns out to be @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are functional determinants capturing gaussian fluctuations around the constant well orbit @xmath46 and the bounce , respectively . in the latter one ,",
    "the contribution from a zero mode direction in function space is omitted . in absence of a heat bath and for @xmath34",
    "the above expression leads to @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the dimensionless barrier height .",
    "while the impact of moderate to fast noise on tunneling rates has been elucidated analytically and numerically in the past @xcite , here , we focus on the low frequency limit and start with a sluggish bath .",
    "this means that the fastest modes available in the environment are still slow on the thermal time scale and compared to the system s well frequency .",

    "the sluggish bath can now most conveniently be treated by exploiting a hubbard - stratonovich transformation and introducing an auxiliary variable .",

    "the analysis of the device becomes particularly transparent in the charging regime ( @xmath203 ) where the two qubit states are determined by superpositions of zero or one excess cooper pairs on the island .",
    "then , the hamiltonian of the box - subsystem can be written in terms of pauli matrices and by measuring all energies in units of @xmath204 the total dimensionless hamiltonian of the circuit reads @xmath205 with the dimensionless parameters @xmath206 , @xmath207 , and @xmath208 . here , @xmath209 is the reduced gate charge and @xmath210 denotes the external bias current .",
    "@xmath211 represents the reduced magnetic flux in units of @xmath212 and @xmath213 is the mass of the artificial particle of the read - out junction with momentum @xmath214 and conjugate phase @xmath215 the dynamics of which takes place in a tilted washboard potential @xmath216 . for further details we refer to @xcite . due to the coupling between the two subsystems , the qubit and the big junction ,",
    "the dynamics of @xmath215 can be seen as that of a particle with two internal states .",
    "now , we consider the situation when the qubit is initially ( @xmath217 ) prepared in its ground state . by rising the bias current @xmath218 adiabatically",
    "the phase @xmath215 can be seen as a classical variable with negligible kinetic energy due to the large capacitance @xmath219 .",
    "depending on the spin state , the artificial particle then evolves on adiabatic potential surfaces @xmath220 obtained by simply diagonalizing @xmath221 in spin space for @xmath222 @xcite .",
    "when @xmath103 is close to 1 , however , the particle may tunnel out of the potential well . in this case",
    "the hamiltonian is most conveniently represented in the spin basis at the minimum @xmath223 of the lower surface @xmath224 , i.e. , @xmath225 here , the diabatic potential surfaces read @xmath226}{\\sqrt{e_c^2 + v_0 ^ 2}}\\right)\\ ] ] and the off diagonal elements @xmath227}{\\sqrt{e_c^2 + v_0 ^ 2}}\\ ] ] where @xmath228 and @xmath229 . by construction , for @xmath230 the off - diagonal elements vanish .",

    ".  [ figure - diabatic ] , right ) , the particle s spin may flip during the tunneling since this may enhance the probability for escape substantially .",

    "the corresponding mqt rate can be cast into @xmath240 where @xmath241 denotes the standard mqt rate without spin flip , while the second term captures contributions due to flips .",
    "the prefactor @xmath242 with @xmath243 the coupling at the crossing point of @xmath236 is related to the probability for a spin flip to occur and @xmath244 is the action along the flip - bounce .",
    "it turns out that a theory based on the non - dissipative partition function ( [ summeflip ] ) provides rates which are already in good agreement with experimental data @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a deeper understanding of the impact of low frequency noise on the zener - flip - tunneling is clearly needed .",
    "it was found in @xcite that when the particle traverses the intersection range of @xmath236 sufficiently fast the flip contribution is dominated by two spin - flips .",
    "further , in case of weak friction the most profound effect of dissipation on the rate is provided by the action factor .",
    "hence , we focus on the two - flip bounce and its action at low temperatures . in generalization of ( [ eq1 - 4b ] ) , the dissipative flip - bounce action takes the form @xmath245 & = & \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace{-2.5 cm } \\int \\limits_{-\\hbar\\beta/2}^{\\hbar\\beta/2 } d\\tau \\left\\ { \\frac{m}{2 } \\ ; \\dot q^2 + v_{-}(q)+ h_{s_1,s_2}(\\tau ) \\ , [ v_+(q)-v_-(q)]\\right\\ } \\nonumber \\\\ & - & \\frac{1}{2 } \\int\\limits_{-\\hbar\\beta/2}^{\\hbar\\beta/2 } d\\tau d\\tau ' q(\\tau ) k(\\tau - \\tau ' ) q(\\tau ' ) \\label{act_quantro}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath246 is the step function being unity in the interval @xmath247 $ ] and zero anywhere else and the kernel follows from ( [ 1overfaction ] ) .",
    "for the two flip contribution the action also depends on the flip times @xmath248 and @xmath249 .",
    "the influence kernel @xmath132 gives according to the analysis of sec .",
    "[ kernel ] rise to a static and a dynamical contribution , see ( [ 1overfaction ] ) .",
    "we first concentrate on weak friction for both , such that a perturbation theory to first order in @xmath158 and @xmath173 applies . by resorting again to a semiclassical evaluation",
    "this amounts to the fact to insert the undamped bounces @xmath250 and @xmath251 , respectively , into the influence functional .",
    "the rate enhancement due to zener flips can then be estimated by the difference between the simple bounce and the flip bounce actions , i.e. , @xmath252 ^ 2-\\left[\\int_{-\\hbar\\beta/2}^{\\hbar\\beta/2}d\\tau q_{\\rm flip}(\\tau)\\right]^2\\right\\}\\\\ \\nonumber & &   \\hspace{-2.5cm}+\\frac{1}{2 } \\left\\{\\int_{-\\hbar\\beta/2}^{\\hbar\\beta/2 } d\\tau d\\tau ' \\tilde{k}(\\tau - \\tau')\\left[q_{\\rm b}(\\tau )   q_{\\rm b}(\\tau')- q_{\\rm flip}(\\tau )   q_{\\rm flip}(\\tau')\\right]\\right\\}\\ , .",
    "\\label{diffact}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the explicit form for the flip bounce and its action has been given in @xcite to which we refer for further details . since the flip bounce always exhibits are smaller amplitude and width ( see fig .  [ figure - bounce ] ) , the terms in curly brackets are always positive .",
    "hence , we arrive at the important result that weak static noise always lowers the rate enhancement due to zener flip tunneling , while weak dynamical noise always increases its effect .",
    "the impact of which actually prevails depends only on the coupling strengths since the respective tunneling orbits enter both corrections in the same way .",
    "we note that so far ( [ diffact ] ) relies only on the weak coupling limit , but applies to any kind of spectral density of the environment .",

    "particularly , the flip - bounce is determined by a vanishing variation of @xmath255 $ ] with respect to all periodic paths and their corresponding flip times .",
    "it turns out that the optimal spin flips occur just as the trajectory reaches the intersection point and that they are centered symmetrically around @xmath256 . for the stationary action",
    "the time dependent potential can therefore be replaced by a piecewise potential @xmath257 where @xmath253 denotes the intersection point .",
    "the equation of motion for the flip bounce thus reads @xmath258    unfortunately , the straightforward approach developed for standard mqt rates and exploited also in sec .",
    "[ adiabatic ] , where the equation of motion is solved numerically by switching to fourier space , does not work here due to the piecewise potential .",
    "its derivative gives rise to @xmath137 function contributions , which pose numerical instabilities that can not be circumvented by the usual rescaling .",
    "we thus determined @xmath259 in coordinate space in an iterative procedure .",
    "one starts with the known flip - bounce for vanishing dissipation @xmath260 on the right hand side and calculates the dissipative flip - bounce @xmath261 by successively using @xmath262 for the dissipative part .",
    "the final flip - bounce follows after a sufficient number of iterations and by preserving the boundary conditions @xmath263 for @xmath264 .",
    "typically , convergence is achieved quickly after @xmath265 steps depending on the dissipation strength . from the flip - bounce the corresponding action",
    "is obtained which , for weak friction , leads together with the non - dissipative prefactor @xmath242 and the standard mqt rate to the total rate in the flip range .    in fig .",
    "[ figure - action ] the rate enhancement due to zener flip tunneling given by the action difference between standard bounce action and flip bounce action is shown for various values of the coupling to a @xmath1 bath .",
    "it is clearly seen that the impact of the static modes prevails and suppresses the enhancement with increasing temperature according to the above discussion . for weak coupling ,",
    "however , the suppression remains small even at higher temperatures . to further illustrate the zener flip effect on rate measurements , we show in fig .",
    "[ figure - zeners ] the probability to escape @xmath266 with varying bias current @xmath103 [ see ( [ probi ] ) ] for the quantronium circuit and in the range where zener flips occur .",
    "qualitatively , zener flips lead to a pronounced shift of the s - curve towards smaller values of the external bias current , though , with a smaller slope in the first part of the curve .",
    "the influence of sluggish bath modes is to slightly move the zener - curve back towards the standard mqt curve , but for weak damping this effect is hardly visible in the s - curves . by comparing with fig .",
    "[ slow - s - curves ] , however , one realizes that the zener - curve resembles a standard mqt curve in presence of a stronger low frequency environment . experimentally , some further information about the influence of environmental modes is thus required to detect the zener flip effect in a single s - curve measurement .",
    "the effect is clearly observable when one measures the bias current needed to maintain a certain value for @xmath266 while sweeping through the zener flip range by varying the magnetic flux @xmath211 @xcite .",
    "macroscopic quantum tunneling has regained new interest in the context of quantum information processing based on josephson junction circuits . in this paper",
    "we analyzed the influence of low to moderate frequency noise on the tunneling rate out of a metastable well , where the noise spectrum is restricted to frequencies somewhat smaller than the typical frequency for oscillations around the well bottom ( plasma frequency ) .",
    "a sluggish bath leads to a rate enhancement linear in the temperature , in contrast to the typical @xmath3 behavior for ohmic environments . for a sluggish bath with an additional @xmath1 characteristic it turns out that even in presence of dynamical modes the static component by far prevails",
    "this verifies that for mqt processes @xmath1 noise can basically be treated as classical noise and in an adiabatic approximation where for very weak coupling one effectively averages over rates for an ensemble of potential barriers .",
    "based on these findings the impact of noise on a particular kind of mqt process has been studied , where a particle carrying a spin-@xmath267 as an internal degree of freedom experiences a zener transition while tunneling . by comparing this new decay channel with ordinary mqt , we find that weak static noise suppresses the enhancement of zener flip tunneling , while weak dynamical noise increases it .",
    "further , we find that for escape probabilities ( s - curves ) the zener flip effect leads qualitatively to a similar result as a standard mqt process under the stronger influence of sluggish bath modes .",
    "for the experimental observation of zener flip tunneling it is thus advantageous to have an environment weakly coupled to the system ( higher @xmath268-factor ) and a spectrum with a decreasing intensity towards low frequency modes , e.g.  with a prevailing ohmic characteristic .",
