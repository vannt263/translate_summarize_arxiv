    "the differential cross section for reaction ( [ eq : hadron ] ) , is expressed as a convolution of partonic cross sections and parton distribution functions : @xmath47 here @xmath48 , and @xmath49 is the fixed - order reduced partonic cross section obtained by first calculating feynman diagrams up to a given fixed - order in qcd perturbation theory and then implementing a renormalization scheme to remove any ultraviolet divergences .",
    "the soft divergences at @xmath50 are cancelled between the virtual diagrams and the bremsstrahlung diagrams .",
    "the collinear divergences ( mass singularities ) at @xmath50 are absorbed into the definition of the parton distribution functions .",

    "collaborators showed that the effects of final - state and initial state gluon radiation tended to compensate in some instances , with final - state radiation tending to soften the spectrum and initial - state radiation broadening the distribution@xcite . to obtain the @xmath126 quark inclusive cross section ,",

    "the limitation on the description of rapidity correlations appears insignificant since these differ little at leading @xcite and next - to - leading order @xcite . on the other hand ,",

    "substantial broadening of the @xmath174 distribution was observed , tantamount to that one would expect if the incident partons carried an intrinsic transverse momentum of about 1.7 gev .",
    "while such a large intrinsic contribution was questioned in ref.@xcite as perhaps an unreliable artifact of the parton shower algorithm , the notable influence of the added transverse momentum on the @xmath174 distribution underscores the importance of the type of study carried out in the present paper .",
    "we recall that our soft gluon resummation introduces substantial additional @xmath224 . as a step in the direction of a full investigation of the influence of soft - gluon resummation on the @xmath174 distribution",

    ", the order @xmath1 perturbative result should be applicable . in the region of small @xmath7 , we argued that resummation techniques developed in the study of the drell - yan reaction should apply for initial state soft gluon radiation .",
