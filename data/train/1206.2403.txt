    "the notorious * problem of time ( pot ) * @xcite occurs because the ` time ' of general relativity ( gr ) and the ` time ' of ordinary quantum theory are mutually incompatible notions .",
    "this incompatibility leads to a number of problems with trying to replace these two branches of physics with a single framework in situations in which the conditions of both apply , such as in black holes or in the very early universe .",
    "i begin with an outline of some relevant aspects of what time means in general @xcite ( sec 1.1 ) and for each of these theories ( sec 1.2 - 3 ) .",
    "\\i ) * time as an ordering*. simultaneity enters here , i.e. a notion of present that separates future and past notions , each of which is perceived differently ( e.g. one remembers the past but not the future ) .",
    "the structure of the present _ instant _ is the whole - universe configuration that includes one s theory s notion of space as well as whatever internal spaces along the lines of gauge theory .",
    "\\ii ) * causation * : that one phenomenon brings at an earlier value of ` the time ' brings about another at a later value .",
    "\\iii ) * temporal logic * : this extends more basic ( atemporal ) logic with  and then \" and  at time @xmath1 \" constructs .",
    "\\iv ) in dynamics , one encounters the idea of * change in time*. thus here time is taken to be a type of container : a parameter with respect to which change is manifest .",
    "newtonian absolute time is an example of this ( and external to the system itself and continuous ) .",
    "contrast the leibniz  mach view of time in sec 1.3 !",
    "there is a long - standing philosophical fork between considering time to be fundamental and time being something that should be eliminated from one s conceptualization of the world .",
    "approaches of the second sort are to reduce questions about ` * being at a time * ' and ` * becoming * ' to just questions of ` * being * ' ( see sec [ tne ] ) .",
    "\\v ) mathematically , time is often taken to be modelled by the real line or an interval of this or a discrete approximation of this . though time can easily be _ position - dependent _ in field theories : @xmath2 in place of @xmath3 .",
    "[ i use @xmath4 to denote either , and follow suit with other quantities using these fonts for finite theories , field theories and portmanteaux of the two .",
    "this notation of straight symbol for field - theoretic version and slanty symbol for finite theory version shall pervade this article . ]",
    "\\vi ) time is additionally habitually taken to be * monotonic * ( rather than direction - reversing ) .",
    "this makes sense as regards its possessing ordering and causation properties .",
    "\\vii ) there is to be freedom in prescribing a timefunction as to the * choice of calendar year zero * and * of tick - duration * , i.e. if @xmath4 is a timefunction , so is @xmath5 for @xmath6 , @xmath7 constants .",
    "\\viii ) a good timefunction is * globally valid * @xcite both over time ( antagonist to the half - finite and finite interval times unless there is a good physical reason for this ) and over space ( made necessary by field theories and , to a greater extent generic curved space / gr ) .",
    "\\ix ) it also makes sense to require one s time function to be * operationally meaningful * ( computable from observable quantities  tangible and accessible in practise ) .    * candidate times*. simply calling an entity a time or a clock does not make it one .",
    "one needs to check a fairly extensive property list before one can be satisfied that it is a ) indeed a time or a clock and b ) that it is useful for accurate work in comparing theory and experiment .",
    "however , what is a sufficient set of properties for a candidate time to be a time is disputed because gr and ordinary qm , so this a choice of a sufficiency of properties rather than just a check - list .",
    "* newtonian absolute time * is what ordinary qm is based upon .",
    "this is a _ fixed _ background parameter .",
    "thus time comes to enter ordinary qm as a background parameter that is    \\1 ) used to mark the evolution of the system .",
    "\\2 ) it is represented by an _",
    "anti_-hermitian operator ( unlike the representation of other quantities ) .",
    "\\3 ) the time  energy uncertainty relation @xmath8",
    "is also given an entirely different meaning to that of the other uncertainty relations .",
    "[ i subsequently use @xmath9 units . ]",
    "\\4 ) there is unitary evolution in time , i.e. that probabilities always sum to one .",
    "this evolution is in accord with the theory s time - dependent wave equation ( for now a time - dependent schrdinger equation ) .",
    "scalar product _ on the hilbert space of states leads to conserved probability currents .",
    "\\5 ) moreover , there is a second dynamical process : collapse of the wavefunction that is held to occur in ordinary qm despite its not being described by the evolution equation of the theory .",
    "* special relativity ( sr ) * brings in the further notions of    \\1 ) a proper time corresponding to each observer , and of    \\2 ) time as another coordinate on ( for now , flat ) spacetime , as opposed to the external absolute time of newtonian physics .",
    "\\3 ) however , time in sr is also external and absolute in the sense of there being ( via the existence of killing vectors ) a presupposed set of privileged inertial frames .",
    "[ the quantum theory can be made independent of a choice of frame if it carries a unitary representation of the poincar group . ] in that sense in sr all one has done is trade one kind of absolute time for another @xcite .",
    "( the changes are in the notion of simultaneity @xcite rather than in removal of the absolute ; also the type of wave equation is now e.g. klein  gordon or dirac . )",
    "thus the passage from newtonian mechanics to sr , and thus from    ordinary qm to relativistic qft does not greatly affect the role of time .",
    "it is only gr that frees one from absolute time , and so that the sr to gr conceptual leap is in many ways bigger than the one from newtonian mechanics to sr . here",
    ",    \\1 ) the conventional * gr spacetime formulation * is in terms of @xmath10 for @xmath11 the spacetime topological manifold and @xmath12 the indefinite spacetime 4-metric that obeys the einstein field equations .",
    "[ i usually restrict to the vacuum case for simplicity , but extending this article s study to include the ordinary matter fields is unproblematic . ]",
    "\\2 ) time is a _",
    "general _ spacetime coordinate in gr , clashing with ordinary qm s having held time to be a unique and sui generis extraneous quantity .",
    "\\3 ) * the generic spacetime has no timelike killing vector * , so much of the preceding qm structure ceases to have an analogue .",
    "this puts an end to being able to pass between absolute structures in going from newtonian mechanics to sr , since the latter s notion of absolute time is based on minkowski spacetime s timelike killing vector .",
    "now instead one has to pass from having privileged frame classes to dealing with the spacetime diffeomorphisms ( which are a much larger and less trivial group of transformations ) .",
    "\\4 ) gr has the time - ordering property , and the notion of causality as an extension of sr but now with matter and gravitation influencing the larger - scale causal properties .",
    "\\5 ) gr additionally has a time non - orientability notion @xcite , and a closed timelike curve notion ; both of these are usually held to be undesirable features for a physical solution to possess .",
    "\\6 ) gr can furthermore be formulated as an evolution of spatial geometry ",
    "the spatial geometries themselves being the entities ( configurations ) that undergo the gr theory s dynamics : gr is a _ geometrodynamics _ ( see sec 2 for more ) .",
    "\\7 ) moreover , time as a general choice of coordinate is embodied geometrically in how gr spacetime is sliced into a * sequence of * ( or * foliation by * ) * spacelike hypersurfaces * corresponding to constant values of that time .",
    "there is one timefunction per choice of foliation ; thus time in gr is said to be ` * many - fingered * ' ( see secs 2 and [ facets ] for further detail ) . that space and time can be thought of as different and yet spacetime also carries insights probably accounts for why a number of pot facets are already present in classical gr ( see secs 3 and [ facets ] ) .",
    "external time is furthermore incompatible with describing truly _ closed _ systems such as closed - universe quantum cosmology itself . in this",
    "setting , page and wootters @xcite have argued convincingly that such a system s only physical states are _ eigenstates _ of the hamiltonian operator , which have an essentially trivial time evolution .",
    "furthermore , the idea of events happening at a single time plays a crucial role in the technical and conceptual foundations of qm , as follows @xcite .",
    "\\1 ) _ measurements _ made at a particular time are a fundamental ingredient of the conventional copenhagen interpretation ( which is anchored on the existence of a privileged time ) .",
    "then in particular @xcite , an * observable * is a quantity whose value can be measured at a ` given time ' . on the other hand , a ` history ' has no direct physical meaning except in so far as it refers to the outcome of a sequence of time - ordered measurements .",
    "that histories are part qm - like in path integral form , but also capable of harbouring gr - like features , may bode well for ( part of ) a reconciliation of gr and qm .",
    "how qm should be _ interpreted _ for the universe as a whole is then a recurring theme ( see e.g. secs 6.34 ) .",
    "\\2 ) in constructing a hilbert space for a quantum theory , one is to select a complete set of observables that are required to _ commute _ at a fixed value of time ",
    "i.e. obey * equal - time commutation relations*. this again extends to sr by considering not one newtonian time but the set of relativistic inertial frames ; then one s qm can be made independent of frame choice via it carrying a unitary representation of the poincar group . for a relativistic qft , the above equal - time commutation relations issue is closely related to requiring _ microcausality _",
    "@xcite : = 0 [ microcausal ] for relativistic quantum field operators @xmath13 and all spacelike - separated spacetime points @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "however , observables and some notion of equal - time commutation relations pose significant difficulties in the context of gr .",
    "our attitude is that background independence is philosophically - desirable and a lesson to be taken on board from gr , quite separately from any detail of the form of its field equations that relativize gravitation .",
    "` background independence ' is to be taken here in the sense of freedom from absolute structures , according to the following .    *",
    "temporal relationalism * @xcite concerns time being not primary for the universe as a whole ( leibniz s view ) .",
    "this is to be implemented by reparametrization - invariance in the absense of extraneous time - like variables the conundrum of our apparent local experience of time is then to be resolved along the lines of mach s time is to be abstracted from change ( see secs 2 and 3 for more detail of these last two sentences ) .    *",
    "configurational relationalism * consists in regarding the configuration space @xmath16 of dynamical objects to possess a group @xmath17 of transformations that are physically irrelevant @xcite .",
    "a classic example are the translations and rotations with respect to absolute space , though the internal - space transformations of gauge theory are also of this nature @xcite .",
    "moreover , background independence already implies a number of pot facets at the classical level , and the rest at the quantum level .",
    "so whenever one adheres to background independence in the above sense , some particular form of the pot arises as a direct consequence , and then one must face it .    note 1 ) whilst einstein was inspired by mach , he did not implement mach directly in setting up gr",
    ". however , direct implementation of mach via temporal and configurational relationalism does give back ( @xcite , secs 3 and 7 ) the dynamical formulation of gr .",
    "note 2 ) background independence criteria are held to be an important feature in e.g. geometrodynamics and loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) .",
    "note 3 ) perturbative covariant quantization involves treating the metric as a small perturbation about a fixed background metric .",
    "this is neither background - independent nor successful on its own terms , at least in the many steps of this program that have been completed , due to nonrenormalizability , and non - unitarity in higher - curvature cases .",
    "perturbative string theory is another background - dependent approach .",
    "this amounts to taking time to be a fixed - background sr - like notion rather than a gr - like one at the deepest level of this formulation . here",
    ", gr s field equations are emergent , so that problems associated with them are not held to be fundamental but should be referred further along to background spacetime metric structure that the strings move in .",
    "moreover , technical issues then drive one to seek nonperturbative background - independent strategies and then pot issues resurface among the various possibilities for the background - independent nature of m - theory .",
    "note 4 ) lqg has a greater degree of background independence than perturbative string theory : it is independent of background _ metric _ structure .",
    "[ however the argument for this can be repeated at the level of background _ topological structure _ ,",
    "for which one is presently very largely unprepared . ]",
    "whilst i consider the frozen formalism problem ( ffp ) in sec 3 and a number of conceptualizations that have been suggested to solve it in sec 6 , unlike in previous pot reviews @xcite , the present review concentrates on how there are other facets ( secs 4 and 5 ) , and on freeing conceptual strategizing from dealing primarily with the ffp ( secs 7 to 13 ) .",
    "the seven other facets are @xcite configurational relationalism , that generalizes the best matching problem that itself generalizes the thin sandwich problem @xcite , the problem of beables ( alias problem of observables ) , the foliation dependence problem , the constraints closure problem , the global pot , the multiple choice problem and the spacetime reconstruction / replacement problem .",
    "secs 6 to 13 additionally update the classic reviews @xcite due to the almost 20 years of work since .",
    "i use relational / machian / background - independent criteria as a characterization / possible deeper explanation of pot facets , and then as a selection criterion on theories and on pot strategies .",
    "these select for semiclassical , many timeless approaches and histories approaches .",
    "i end by considering composite of these strategies in sec 14 : halliwell - type @xcite and gambini  porto  pullin - type @xcite approaches .",
    "in dynamical / canonical approaches , the spacetime manifold @xmath18 is ` 3 + 1 ' split ( into 3-@xmath19 space and 1 time dimension ) into @xmath20 .",
    "this assumes that the spatial topology @xmath21 does not change with coordinate time @xmath22 .",
    "this furthermore assumes that gr is globally hyperbolic @xcite , which amounts to determinability of gr evolution from gr initial data ; this excludes e.g. time non - orientability and closed timelike curves .",
    "some considerations involve a single @xmath21 embedded into gr spacetime ( or without that assumption , usually leading to its deduction , c.f .",
    "sec [ facets ] ) .",
    "some further considerations require a _ foliation _",

    "note 2 ) the gr momentum constraint is straightforwardly interpretable in terms of the physicality residing solely in terms of the 3-geometry of space rather than in its coordinatization / point - identification .",
    "however , interpreting the gr hamiltonian constraint is tougher ; this leads to the ffp .    note 3 ) on the other hand , the gr momentum constraint often becomes entwined in technical problems that afflict pot strategies .",

    "the dirac algebroid has remarkable properties at the classical level , as exposited in sec [ facets ] .",

    "this suggests that the paradox apparent rather than actual .",
    "the usual form of the ffp is that variation with respect to the lapse implies the purely quadratic @xmath51 , which implies the ffp at the quantum level .",
    "that reparametrization invariance implies a purely quadratic @xmath51 is also fairly commonly stated in the literature .",
    "however , the stance of barbour and collaborators @xcite is that leibnizian temporal relationalism is the starting point and that this is _ implemented by _",

    "over the past decade , it has become more common to suggest or imply that the pot _ is _ the frozen formalism problem .",
    "however , a more long - standing point of view @xcite ( and also argued in favour for in e.g. @xcite and the present article ) is that the pot contains a number of further facets .",

    "one then has to face that the commutator algebroid of the quantum constraints is almost certainly distinct from    classical gr s dirac algebroid , and may contain foliation - dependent anomalies too .    attitude 2 ) background - dependent / privileged slicing alternatives are approaches with times with sufficient significance imposed on them that they can not be traded for other times ( these are more like the ordinary quantum theory notion of time than the conventional lore of time in gr ) . as the below examples",
    "show , the amount of theorizing involving attitude 2 ) has been on the increase ; however , i first present a few cautions .",
    "note 1 ) one should disentangle attitude 2 ) from how special highly - symmetric solutions _ can _ have geometrically - preferred foliations .",
    "however , gr is about generic solutions , and even perturbations about highly - symmetric solutions cease to have geometrically - privileged foliations to the perturbative order of precision @xcite",
    ". additionally , even highly - symmetric solutions admitting a privileged foliation in gr are _ refoliable _ , so the below problem with losing refoliation invariance does not apply .    note",
    "2 ) as states @xcite , _  the foliation fixing prevents one from asking what would happen if one attempted to measure the gravitational degrees of freedom on an arbitrary hypersurface .",
    "such a solution amounts to conceding that one can quantize gravity only by giving up gr : to say that a quantum theory makes sense only when one fixes the foliation is essentially the same thing as saying that quantum gravity makes sense only in one coordinate system . \" _    note 3 ) on the other hand , one can not press too hard with envisaging different foliations as corresponding to various motions of a cloud of observers distributed throughout space , since that could also be modelled by multiple congruences of curves without reference to multiple foliations .    example",
    "2.1 ) einstein  aether theory @xcite has privileged background structures due to a unit timelike vector field .",
    "example 2.2 ) shape dynamics in the sense of @xcite has a fixed cmc foliation . here , one  _ trades refoliation invariance for a conformal symmetry _ \" .",
    "[ moreover , not everybody working in this area is holding out for a fixed - foliation interpretation .",
    "the situation is an enlarged phase space ` linking theory ' , for which one gauge - fixing produces a gr sector and another gauge - fixing produces a cmc - fixed sector .",
    "then from the perspective of the linking theory , gr and cmc - fixed sector are gauge - related .",
    "]    example 2.3 ) hoava  lifshitz theory ( hlt ) @xcite has a privileged foliation ( which has also been identified @xcite as cmc ) . in this approach , one gives objective existence to the foliation and then have solely the foliation - preserving subset of the 4-diffeomorphisms , diff@xmath190 .",
    "there are in fact various versions of hlt , corresponding to whether @xmath191(t alone ) or @xmath192 , crossed with what form the potential term is to take .",
    "the @xmath191(t alone ) theories , by obvious parallel with sec 3 , avoid having a local @xmath51 and thus ffp , though this is clearly at the expense of dropping many of the gr - like properties of time .",
    "the other theories produce a local @xmath51 and have been found to require extension in the number of included terms @xcite so as to remain viable .",
    "example 2.4 ) some of the more successful forms of cdt have been found to involve preferred foliations @xcite .",
    "example 2.5 ) soo and yu @xcite look to use a master constraint - type argument so as to also trade refoliation invariance for a privileged foliation theory .",
    "note 3 ) the above examples bear rich inter - relations .",
    "if einstein  aether theory s unit timelike vector is restricted to be hypersurface - orthogonal , the infra - red limit of the extended @xmath192 hlt is recovered @xcite . searching for a suitable classical limit , the abovementioned cdt s produced hlt spacetime rather than gr spacetime @xcite ; soo and yu s approach has links with hlt too .",
    "also see @xcite for further inter - relations between hlt and both the rwr and shape dynamics areas of barbour s relational program .",
    "note 4 ) fixed foliations are a type of background - dependence , which , from a relational perspective , is undesirable _ from the outset _",
    ", for all that investigating the effects of making _ just _ this concession is indeed also of theoretical interest .    as regards attitude 1 ) , it can be used to provide a strong basic counting argument against the unimodular approach .",
    "for , there can only be 1 degree of freedom in a time @xmath193 that arises from the cosmological constant , and this can not possibly index the plethora of foliations corresponding to gr s many - fingered time notion .",
    "the geometrical origin of this mismatch is that a cosmological time measures the 4-volume enclosed between two embeddings of the associated internal time functional @xmath194 .",
    "however , given one of the embeddings the second is not uniquely determined by the value of @xmath193 ( since pairs of embeddings that differ by a zero 4-volume are obviously possible due to the lorentzian signature and can not be distinguished in this way ) .",
    "some constructive examples of attitude 1 ) are as follows .",
    "example 1.1 ) kouletsis and @xcite provided a means of including the set of foliations into an extension of the arnowitt  deser ",
    "misner phase space that is generally covariant .",
    "this amounts to extending phase space to include embeddings so as to take into account the discrepancy between the diff(m ) algebra and the dirac algebroid ( itself an older idea of isham and kucha ) , here effectuated by construction of a time map and a space map .",
    "thus this is a @xmath167 k ... approach ; it remains unstudied for gr past the classical level .",
    "example 1.2 ) in savvidou s approach to hpo , she pointed out that the space of histories has implicit dependence on the foliation vector ( the unit vector @xmath44 mentioned in sec 2 as being orthogonal to a given hypersurface ) . with this view of the hpo approach admitting 2 types of time transformation",
    ", the histories brackets turn out to now be foliation - dependent .",
    "however , the probabilities that are the actual physical quantities , are _ not _ foliation - dependent , so this approach avoids having a foliation dependence problem at its end .",
    "example 1.3 ) isham and savvidou also considered the possibility of quantizing the classical foliation vector itself @xcite .",
    "here ,    \\ { _ } = n _ , \\{^ } = i \\",
    "{ n _ - n _ } , where the antisymmetric @xmath195 is the conjugate of @xmath44 and satisfies the lorentz algebra .",
    "they then apply a group - theoretic quantization to the configuration space of all foliation vectors for the minkowski spacetime toy model of the hpo approach .",
    "closure becomes complicated at the quantum level .",
    "firstly , one has to bear in mind that the classical and quantum algebras / algebroids are not in fact necessarily related due to global and multiple choice problem considerations @xcite .",
    "suppose then that we experience non - closure .",
    "\\1 ) one could try to blame this on operator - ordering ambiguities , and continue to try to obtain closure .",
    "\\2 ) another counter that is sometimes available is to set some numerical factor of the obstructing term to zero ; this is the same means by which string theory arrives at its particular dimensionalities .",
    "\\3 ) another possibility is to accept the qm - level loss of what had been a symmetry at the classical level .",
    "\\4 ) yet another possibility is that including additional matter fields could cancel off the anomaly hitherto found ; some supergravity theories exhibit this feature .",
    "\\5 ) a final possibility is to consider a new constraint algebroid , in particular a simpler one , along the lines of e.g. the    @xmath40(@xmath3 alone ) hlt or the master constraint program .",
    "the latter cuts down the number of constraints so far that it would free the theory of all anomalies ; however , that is in itself suspect since the same conceptual packaging of constraints into a master constraint would then appear to be applicable to the flat - spacetime gauge theory of standard particle physics , and yet these have not been declared to no longer have anomaly concerns .",
    "on the other hand , other constraint algebroid variants enlarge the algebroid , e.g. more traditional forms of lqg algebroid ( anomaly analysis for which is in e.g. @xcite ) , histories algebroid @xcite or a linking theory algebroid @xcite .",
    "non - closure can be due to foliation - dependent terms , or , if scale is included among the physically irrelevant variables , then there can also be conformal anomalies ; these are likely to plague shape dynamics .",
    "finally , note that the concept of ` _ observables / beables anomaly _ ' , i.e. finding that promoting classical observables / beables to qm operators may produce quantities that do not commute with the quantum versions of the constraints .",
    "this will tend to add to the futility of o ... q schemes , since classical problem of beables solutions need not readily carry over to qm problem of beables solutions .",
    "at least in the simpler physical theories , observables / beables may well be largely exempt due to the nice properties of lie groups under quantization schemes , but , in cases going beyond that ( dirac observables , the classical dirac algebroid ... ) one may find one has to solve the qm problem of beables again .",
    "see the halliwell combined scheme of sec 14.1 for a good example , there are separate classical and qm implementations for dirac - type observables / beables , whilst the observables translate over straightforwardly for the triangle rpm model @xcite .",
    "global attitude 1 ) insist on only using globally - valid quantities for timefunctions and observables .",
    "example 1.1 scale times are not useable globally - in - time in recollapsing universes due to non - monotonicity . passing to dilational times ( conjugate to scales ) such as york time remedies this problem .",
    "example 1.2 ) the global pot then occurs e.g. in the separation into true and embedding ( space frame and timefunction ) variables in the internal time approach ( the torre impasse @xcite ) .",
    "example 1.3 ) moreover the above example s split might be defineable in some case , but only for some sequence of slices that can not be indefinitely continued as one progresses along a foliation that is to cover the entirety of that spacetime ( e.g. not all spacetimes can be entirely foliated by cmc slices ) .",
    "example 1.4 ) simpler models timefunctions can eventually going astray for some other reason not involving foliations [ after all , many simpler models do not have ( meaningful ) notions of foliation ] .",
    "e.g. in the semiclassical approach , the allotment of h - l status may be only local in configuration space , with the approximate dynamical trajectory / wavepacket free to leave that region , and likewise the wkb regime itself may only be local , and all of this can already happen e.g. in rpm s for which the notion of foliation is moot .",
    "example 1.5 ) the global pot can partly be avoided by using some timeless approach , though elements of this construct including the semblance of dynamics itself may be local .",
    "global attitude 2 ) allow for use of patching of various notions of time and of observables that are only locally valid @xcite . whilst this was very naturally covered at the classical level by time being a coordinate and thus only in general locally valid and subject to the ordinary differential - geometric meshing condition",
    ", the problem now is how to mesh together different unitary evolutions .",
    "many of the other pot facets themselves have global issues ( e.g. global best - matching resolution , global observables , globally valid foliations , globally valid spacetime reconstructions ) .",
    "example 2.1 ) bojowald et al s * fashionables * concept @xcite , or my * degradeables * parallel @xcite .",
    "fashionables are observables local in time and space , whereas degradeables are beables that are local in time and space .",
    "these are good words for local concepts , viz ` fashionable in italy ' , ` fashionable in the 1960 s ' , ` degradeable outside of the freezer ' and ` degradeable within a year ' all making good sense . also , fashion is in the eye of the beholder ",
    "observer - tied , whereas degradeability is a mere matter of being , rather than of any observing .",
    "these are * patching approaches * : observables / beables , and timefunctions , are held to only be valid on certain local patches .",
    "this holds for any of the dirac , and partial variants .",
    "example 2.2 ) bojowald et al s patching approach uses a moments expansion as a bypass on the inner product problem .",
    "it is also semiclassical , in their sense that they neglect o(@xmath196 ) and moment - polynomials above some degree .",
    "bojowald et al s specific fashionables implementation is based on time going complex around turning points within their notion of semiclassical regime . however , the geometrical interpretation of this transition between these fashionables is , for now , at least to me , unclear .",
    "example 2.3 ) at the level of observables for rpm s , using fashionables / degradeables means that the functionals of the shapes ( and scales ) and their conjugates do not need to be valid over the whole of configuration space .",
    "sec 8 s examples can be upgraded likewise to be about functionals that are local in the corresponding configuration spaces .",
    "rpm s should also allow for bojowald s working to be considered in cases which posses the major midisuperspace features .",
    "whilst patchings are multiple , and @xcite claim that as an multiple choice problem solver too , this does not address whole of this problem . generally , the multiple choice problem is multi - faceted  due to a heterogeneous collection of mathematical causes .",
    "multiplicity of times is also inherent in rovelli s ` any change ' and ` partial observables ' based relationalism , and in my stlrc ( where one tests one s way among the many to find the locally - best ) .",
    "\\1 ) some cases of multiple choice problem reflect foliation dependence .",
    "it has been suggested ( e.g. in @xcite ) that one way out of the multiple choice problem is to specify the lapse @xmath40 and shift @xmath41 a priori .",
    "however , such amounts to yet another case of    foliation fixing ( so return to sec [ fol ] ) .",
    "\\2 ) it may be that some cases of multiple choice problem could be due to context : different observers observing different subsystems that have different notions of time ; this fits in well with the partial observables and patching paradigms .",
    "\\3 ) some cases of multiple choice problem involve how choosing different times at the classical level for subsequent use ( ` promotion to operators ' ) at the quantum level can lead to unitarily - inequivalent qm s , even if at the classical level they are canonically - related .",
    "this is due to the groenewold  van hove phenomenon ( which already holds for finite theories ) .",
    "this is a time problem if one s search for time takes one among the classical observables ( i.e. o ...",
    "t ... q approaches ) .",
    "\\4 ) possible problems with patching are that the moments approach looks to rely on classical and quantum having the same kinematical bracket algebra ( generally untrue @xcite ) .",
    "the moments approach s use of all polynomials ( up to a given degree in the approximate case detailed in @xcite ) may be at odds with the groenewold  van hove phenomenon , indicating that subalgebra - selection reasons for the multiple choice problem are not included .",
    "thus only a partial resolution of the multiple choice problem looks to be on offer here .",
    "the groenewold ",
    "van hove part of the multiple choice problem is at least part - avoidable via the semiclassical approach being less reliant on kinematical subalgebra choices or unitary inequivalences .",
    "a further spacetime reconstruction problem subfacet is that , in internal time approaches , internal space or time coordinates are to be used in the conventional classical spacetime context ; these need to be scalar field functions on the spacetime 4-manifold . in particular , functions of this form do not have any foliation dependence . however , the canonical approach to gr uses functionals of the canonical variables , and which there is no a priori reason for such to be scalar fields of this type .",
    "thus one is faced with either finding functionals with this property ( establishing foliation independence by construction and standard spacetime interpretation recovery ) , or with coming up with some new means of arriving at the standard spacetime meaning at the classical level .",
    "microcausality recovery is possible in the savvidou @xcite or kouletsis @xcite canonical - covariant formalisms ( though this work has as yet very largely not been extended to the quantum level ) .",
    "programs are indeed often designed so that the continuum with spacetime properties recovery is the last facet to face .",
    "example 1 ) the status of the spacetime reconstruction problem remains unclear for the semiclassical approach once examined in detail @xcite .",
    "the next examples involve bottom - up approaches , i.e. less structure assumed .",
    "example 2 ) getting back a semblance of dynamics or a notion of history from timeless approaches counts as a type of spacetime reconstruction .",
    "this is in contradistinction to approaches in which histories are assumed .",
    "example 3 ) in lqg , semiclassical weave states have been considered by e.g. ashtekar , rovelli , smolin , arnsdorf and bombelli ; see @xcite for a brief review and critique of these works .",
    "subsequent lqg semiclassical reconstruction work has mostly involved instead ( a proposed counterpart of the notion of ) _ coherent states _ constructed by the complexifier method @xcite ; see @xcite for a different take on such .",
    "in lorentzian spin foams , semiclassical limits remain a largely open problem ; e.g. @xcite is a treatment of lorentzian spin foams that also covers how the regge action emerges as a semiclassical limit in the euclidean case , whilst almost all the semiclassical treatment in the most recent review @xcite remains euclidean .",
    "the further lqc truncation @xcite does possess solutions that look classical at later times ( amidst larger numbers of solutions that do not , which are , for now , discarded due to not looking classical at later times , which is somewhat unsatisfactory in replacing predictivity by what amounts to a _ future _ boundary condition ) .",
    "it also possesses further features of a semiclassical limit @xcite ( here meaning a wkb regime with powers of both @xmath197 and immirzi s @xmath58 neglected , whilst still subject to open questions about correct expectation values of operators in semiclassical states ) .",
    "example 4 ) cdt succeeds in generating a classical regime @xcite , albeit this is hlt rather than gr , which is subject to the various foliation - related issues in sec [ fol ] as well as non - pot related advantages in ultra - violet behaviour . from this , we may deduce that sometimes reconstructing spacetime is more straightforward if we forfeit its refoliation - invariance property ( i.e. trading completion of one facet for taking the consequences of refusing to face another ) .",
    "see also @xcite for a semiclassical analysis of cdt .",
    "example 5 ) spacetime reconstruction difficulties are to be expected from the causal sets approach s insistence on very sparse structure ; for recent advances here , see e.g. @xcite for a recovery of a spacetime - like notion of topology , or @xcite for a recovery of a metric notion .",
    "example 6 ) euclidean counterparts of dynamical triangulation run into wick rotation ambiguities ( a similar situation to that observed in @xcite ) , and @xcite argue this to be evidence for the need to maintain the notion of causality .",
    "i favour @xcite the machian @xmath78 as classical - level resolution of the pot modulo solving the best matching problem .",
    "one is then to continue at the quantum level by replacing @xmath78 by the equally - machian @xmath116 .",
    "one is to justify the underlying wkb ansatz by some combined approach , the most promising of which is along the lines of halliwell s histories , records and semiclassical combined approach ( see sec 14.1 ) . it may be possible to use a more minimalistic combined scheme instead ; the final subsection 14.2 contains two such . as regards these schemes involving semiclassicality , whilst this is a limitation for other purposes ,",
    "is argued to be valuable e.g. in the quantum - cosmological setting in footnote [ gnimmel ] .",
    "both histories and timeless approaches lie on the common ground of atemporal logic structures @xcite , and there is a records theory within histories theory , as per sec 6.4 .",
    "the semiclassical approach and/or histories theory could support records theory by providing a mechanism for the semblance of dynamics .",
    "histories decohereing is a leading ( but as yet _ not fully established _ ) way by which the semiclassical regime s wkb approximation could be legitimately obtained in the first place",
    ". the elusive question of which degrees of freedom decohere which should be answerable through where in the universe the information is actually stored , i.e. where the records thus formed are @xcite ; as gell - mann and hartle say @xcite , .",
    "[ situ ] emergent semiclassical time amounts to an approximate semiclassical recovery @xcite of emergent classical jbb time @xcite is an encouraging result as regards making such a semiclassical  timeless records combination .",
    "more concretely , the semiclassical approach aids in the computation of timeless probabilities of histories entering given configuration space regions .",
    "this is by the wkb assumption giving a semiclassical flux into each region @xcite ; this approach does not , however , proceed via an emergent semiclassical time dependent schrdinger equation such as in sec 6.2 .",
    "these timeless probabilities , and decoherence functionals , can be built from the class - function objects of eq ( 36 ii ) .",
    "these are additionally s - matrix quantities , resolving part of the problem of beables , and a first simple model ( rpm ) with linear constraints included has also been resolved @xcite . finally these are indeed locally - interpretable concepts and so are furthermore compatible with the basic conceptual ethos of fashionables / degradeables , giving some hope of global pot resolution and partial multiple choice resolution , so this approach comes fairly close to resolving the pot in semiclassical regimes , and _ very _ close to resolving the pot for rpm s themselves .",
    "moreover , whilst conceptually illustrative , the class function ( 36 ii ) itself has technical problems , in particular it suffers from the quantum zeno problem .",
    "this can be dealt with firstly by considering the following reformulation @xcite : ( n ) ... ( 2 ) ( ) = ( -iht ) , as well as now conceptualizing in terms of probabilities of _ never _ entering the region .",
    "next , one applies halliwell s ` softening ' ( in the sense of scattering theory ) , passing to ( n ) ...",
    "( 2 ) ( ) = ( -i(h - iv_0 p)t ) for @xmath198 .",
    "the class operator for _ not _ passing through region r is then c _ = ( i h t_2 ) ( -i\\{h - iv}\\{t_2 - t_1 } ) ( - i h t_1 ) .",
    "this now does not suffer from the quantum zeno problem whilst remaining an s - matrix quantity and thus commuting with @xmath62uad .",
    "the most developed of these to date is gambini  porto ",
    "pullin s @xcite .",
    "this is built upon a different formulation of conditional probabilities objects : = .",
    "[ newp ] the p(@xmath4 ) s here are heisenberg time evolutions of projectors p : @xmath199 these conditional probabilities allow for ` being at a time ' to be incorporated .",
    "this approach is for now based on the ` any change ' notion of relational clocks ( that can be changed @xcite to the stlrc notion ) .",
    "moreover , these clocks are taken to be non - ideal at the qm level , giving rise to    \\1 ) a decoherence mechanism ( distinct from that in histories theory ; there is also a non - ideal rod source of decoherence postulated ; the general form of the argument is in terms of imprecise knowledge due to imprecise clocks and rods ) .",
