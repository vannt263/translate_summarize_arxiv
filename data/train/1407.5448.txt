    "the study of functionals of stochastic processes attracts considerable interest from various points of view , most notably in the context of large deviation theory where the probability distribution of integrals or sums of random variables result in a potential characterizing large deviations from the mean and extreme events ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "some simple functionals can characterize the time a process spends at a phase space point or in a phase space region , or more simply such integrals may just represent physical quantities like the position of an object @xcite . here",
    "we consider these functionals in the context of piecewise - smooth stochastic systems .",
    "we use the motion of a brownian particle subjected to dry friction as an illustrative example where explicit expressions for the distribution of functionals can be derived in a formally exact manner , and where we can quantify the deviation from gaussian behavior which prevails in the asymptotic limit .",
    "functionals of a process @xmath0 have been investigated intensively in the past and have found numerous applications in physics @xcite .",
    "for instance , two of the popular functionals are the local time @xmath1 and the occupation time @xmath2 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , which describe how much time the process @xmath0 has visited the origin and how long it has taken positive values in the time window @xmath3 $ ] , respectively . here",
    "@xmath4 is the dirac delta function and @xmath5 is the step function with @xmath6 for @xmath7 and @xmath8 for @xmath9 . in addition , the area under the process , i.e. , @xmath10 , which is referred to as displacement if @xmath0 denotes the velocity of an object , is of particular importance due to its physical meaning .    to find statistical properties of functionals",
    "is usually nontrivial even for some of the simplest functionals , such as the local time and the occupation time . for the displacement , which is equivalent to solve a stochastic differential equation with inertial term ,",
    "one often restricts the study to the overdamped case , in which limit the inertial term can be neglected @xcite .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , the distributions of the displacement are only available in closed analytic form for the cases of the pure diffusion process and the ornstein - uhlenbeck process @xcite . to compute the distribution of a functional there are two significant achievements , i.e. , the celebrated feynman - kac formula developed by kac @xcite and the so - called backward fokker - planck technique proposed by majumdar and comtet @xcite .",
    "the former enables one to obtain a corresponding schrdinger equation for the distribution of a functional and the later results in a backward fokker - planck equation for the distribution .",
    "the advantage of the later over the former is that the later depends only on the initial condition of the process , no extra integral over @xmath11 is required to obtain the distribution of the functional .    in this paper",
    ", we attempt to derive analytic results for some functionals of the brownian motion with dry ( also called solid or coulomb ) friction , @xmath12 which is used to describe the velocity of a solid object of unit mass subjected to a dry friction in addition to a viscous drag and a random noise ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "here @xmath13 , denoting the sign of @xmath14 , represents the dry friction force with coefficient @xmath15 , @xmath16 denotes the viscous coefficient and @xmath17 is the strength of the gaussian white noise @xmath18 characterized by @xmath19 the notation @xmath20 stands for the average over all possible realizations of the noise . for this piecewise - linear stochastic model , the transition probability distribution or propagator can be obtained by using spectral decomposition methods @xcite or laplace transforms @xcite . especially , when @xmath21 , i.e. , the model ( [ ad_ch2 ] ) with pure dry friction ( also call brownian motion with two - valued drift ) , the corresponding propagator is available in closed analytic form ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the weak - noise approximation of the model ( [ ad_ch2 ] ) has also been investigated in detail by using a path integral approach @xcite .",
    "in addition , the first - passage time distributions of eq .",
    "( [ ad_ch2 ] ) can be derived by using spectral decomposition methods or solving the backward kolmogorov equation ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the dry friction effect in stochastic settings is also observed in experiments , such as those investigated recently by chaudhury _",
    "_ @xcite and gnoli _ et al .",
    "since the motion of two solid objects over each other is ubiquitous in nature @xcite , the dry friction model ( [ ad_ch2 ] ) plays a significant role at the interface between theory and experiment .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to have a close look at stochastic properties of functionals whose underlying dynamics is governed by this model .",
    "in particular we will focus on the local time , the occupation time and the displacement in this paper .",
    "it is worth noting that the local time and the occupation time of the pure dry friction case [ i.e. , @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( [ ad_ch2 ] ) ] have been investigated in @xcite even though the authors did not attempt to study the dry friction effect in a stochastic setting .",
    "an integral representation of the occupation time distribution of this simple model has also been derived in @xcite .",
    "but the recursive relations for the moments of the local time and the occupation time have not been given explicitly .",
    "in addition , to the best of our knowledge analytic results of the displacement for the pure dry friction case and functionals of the full model ( [ ad_ch2 ] ) are not available in the literature .",
    "the rest of this paper is arranged as follows .",
    "we first extend in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] the backward fokker - planck technique for a positive support functional to an arbitrary support functional by replacing the double laplace transform used in @xcite with a fourier - laplace transform . rather than solving the backward equation directly ,",
    "we then derive from this equation a recursive ordinary differential equation ( ode ) for the moments of the functional . in secs .",
    "[ sec3 ] and [ sec4 ] , we show that the moments of the local time and the occupation time are given explicitly by the solution of the corresponding homogeneous ode .",
    "then we apply the results to solve the dry friction model ( [ ad_ch2 ] ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] , even though a simple formula is not available for a general drift , we show that the moments of the displacement can be obtained in the laplace space for the dry friction model ( [ ad_ch2 ] ) .",
    "finally , results are summarized in sec .",
    "let us consider the functional @xmath22 for an integrable kernel @xmath23 .",
    "the stochastic process @xmath0 with initial condition @xmath24 is assumed to obey the following langevin equation @xmath25 with potential @xmath26 , where @xmath18 denotes the gaussian white noise defined by eq .",
    "( [ aa_ch2 ] ) . in",
    "what follows , we will first discuss some general properties of the distribution @xmath27 of the functional ( [ mya ] ) . in the latter parts we are then going to derive relations for the moments @xmath28 of @xmath29 which will be used in the applications .",
    "while it may be difficult to derive closed analytic expressions for the distribution @xmath27 of the functional ( [ mya ] ) , some statements can be made on the asymptotic properties in the limit of large @xmath30 if we assume that the potential of the langevin equation ( [ ca_ch2 ] ) is stable , i.e. , @xmath31 when @xmath32 , and that the correlation of the corresponding process decays sufficiently fast .",
    "then a simple heuristic argument suggests ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) that the distribution @xmath27 is simply gaussian around its mean in the long time limit .",
    "thus the limiting distribution is characterized only by the first and the second moments , @xmath33,\\ ] ] where @xmath34 and @xmath35 stand for the first moment and the variance of @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "as stated in @xcite , the argument is as follows : at large time @xmath37 , assuming the process @xmath0 to be mixing , the corresponding propagator @xmath38 tends to the stationary distribution @xmath39/z $ ] , where @xmath40 is a normalization factor .",
    "hence , at time increments which exceed the correlation time of the system , the random variables @xmath41 are only weakly correlated .",
    "therefore , from the definition ( [ mya ] ) we expect a central limit theorem to hold in the limit of @xmath37 being much larger than the relaxation time and the correlation time of the two aforementioned variables , resulting finally in a gaussian distribution for the functional @xmath36 around its mean .",
    "hence , in order to determine the limiting distribution of @xmath36 around its mean we only need to obtain the first and the second moments , which can be attained by using the results stated in the following subsections .",
    "our arguments will be able to predict higher - order cumulants as well so that we provide a quantitative tool to benchmark the aforementioned reasoning .",
    "for the subsequent investigations we will need the boundary conditions of the distribution @xmath27 in the limit when @xmath42 tends to infinity .",
    "these boundary conditions depend on the particular function @xmath23 which enters the functional @xmath29 .",
    "they can be derived from the observation that a process starting at infinity can not cross the origin in finite time . for simplicity",
    "let us discuss two particular choices , namely @xmath43 and @xmath44 , corresponding to the so - called local time @xmath45 which measures the time that the process visits the origin , and the so - called occupation time @xmath46 which measures the time that the process takes positive values .",
    "hence for the distribution of the local time we have @xmath47 and for the occupation time the boundary condition reads @xmath48 the third quantity we are going to discuss in some detail will be the displacement of the particle which can also be written as a functional with the choice @xmath49 , i.e. , @xmath50 for the displacement , the argument of the boundary condition is slightly more subtle .",
    "we expect that for @xmath51 the velocity of the particle does not change considerably in the time window @xmath3 $ ] and that the displacement should be at the scale of @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , the corresponding boundary condition can be formally approximated as @xmath53 in the asymptotic limit @xmath54 .",
    "such a condition will be used later to obtain the boundary condition for the moments of the displacement .",
    "we start to derive one of the main results by assuming the potential @xmath26 to be continuous and to be smooth everywhere apart from @xmath55 where we allow the potential to be not differentiable , so that the deterministic part of the langevin equation ( [ ca_ch2 ] ) has a discontinuity at @xmath56 .",
    "more general cases of piecewise - smooth systems could be considered with ease but the discussion of this special case will be sufficient to uncover the general structure .",
    "in addition , our particular choice also contains the dry friction model ( [ ad_ch2 ] ) . for a nonnegative support functional",
    "it has been shown by majumdar and comtet @xcite that the double laplace transform of the distribution @xmath27 satisfies a backward equation .",
    "@xmath57 similarly , using the method stated in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) it is straightforward to show that @xmath58 satisfies the following backward equation    @xmath59 r(k , s , v_0)+1=0 . \\label{ae}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    let us assume that the @xmath60-th moment @xmath28 of @xmath36 exists so that the moments of @xmath36 in the laplace space are given by @xmath61 thus by acting the operator @xmath62 on eq .",
    "( [ ae ] ) and setting @xmath63 , we obtain a hierarchy of equations for @xmath64 , @xmath65    which is easier to deal with than solving eq .",
    "( [ ae ] ) .      in order to solve eq .",
    "( [ bd_ch5 ] ) , it is essential to know the boundary conditions for the moments in the limit @xmath66 . using eq .",
    "( [ bi_ch5 ] ) and the uniform convergence of the laplace transform for @xmath67 it follows that the moments of the local time obey @xmath68 whereas a similar argument and eq .",
    "( [ bk_ch5 ] ) yield for the moments of the occupation time that @xmath69 for @xmath70 and @xmath71 . for the displacement , the reasoning presented at the end of subsection [ subii1 ] suggests that the @xmath72-th moment of the displacement as a function of @xmath42 should be bounded by a polynomial of order @xmath60 in @xmath42 .",
    "we will see later that this condition is sufficient to determine the solution of the dry friction model ( [ ad_ch2 ] ) .",
    "since we are here concerned with a piecewise - smooth potential @xmath26 , say with a kink at @xmath56 , we have to solve eq .",
    "( [ bd_ch5 ] ) for @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively . even for a piecewise - smooth potential @xmath75",
    "the solution of eq .",
    "( [ bd_ch5 ] ) has to be at least continuous , so that we require continuity of the moments at @xmath76 , resulting in the first matching condition @xmath77 as for the first derivative we may obtain a matching condition by integrating eq .",
    "( [ bd_ch5 ] ) across the discontinuity at @xmath78 . because of the continuity of the moments the right hand side will contribute only if the kernel @xmath79 has a @xmath80 singularity at @xmath56 .",
    "thus for the local time ( [ myd ] ) the matching condition reads @xmath81 whereas for any other kernel , e.g. , for the occupation time and for the displacement the matching condition just simplifies to @xmath82 here we have used the shorthand notation @xmath83 to denote @xmath84 .",
    "let us briefly discuss how we are going to approach the analytic solution of the hierarchy ( [ bd_ch5 ] ) for a general potential @xmath75 with nonanalyticity at @xmath56 .",
    "suppose that the appropriate fundamental piecewise - smooth solution @xmath85 of the corresponding homogeneous ode of eq .",

    ", we consider the hierarchy ( [ bd_ch5 ] ) separately on the two domains @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "given @xmath91 [ see eq .",
    "( [ bd_ch5 ] ) ] we denote by @xmath92 a particular solution of the inhomogeneous differential equation ( for @xmath93 ) which fulfils the boundary condition at infinity . by adding a multiple of the homogeneous solution",
    "@xmath85 we then obtain two branches with two constants of integration which are adjusted according to the matching conditions ( see subsection [ subsec2 ] ) .",
    "hence , at each level of the hierarchy we determine a particular solution @xmath94 and construct the general solution , which already satisfies the boundary condition at infinity ( see subsection [ subsec1 ] ) , through @xmath95 finally we compute the coefficients @xmath96 with the help of the matching conditions at @xmath76 ( see subsection [ subsec2 ] ) .",
    "the relevance of the trivial eq .",
    "( [ bh0_ch5 ] ) comes from the observation that we just have to deal with the matching conditions caused by the nonanalyticities of the potential .",
    "furthermore , in most of the cases considered here , we will be able to express the particular solutions @xmath94 in terms of the homogeneous solution @xmath97 as well , so that the entire structure just requires solving eq .",
    "( [ by_ch5 ] )",
    ".    we may not be able to do the inverse laplace transform for the moments analytically .",
    "however , in the long time limit the behavior of the moments is dominated by the singular terms of the laplace transform and those are often not too difficult to evaluate",
    ". we can also resort to numerical laplace inversion , such as the so - called talbot method @xcite , which usually gives accurate results even at a very short time .    in the next three sections",
    ", we will apply the formula ( [ bh0_ch5 ] ) to the local time , the occupation time , and the displacement .",
    "the analysis of the local time can be largely done for general potential while we are going to derive explicit formulas for the other two observables for the dry friction model ( [ ad_ch2 ] ) without and with viscous friction , respectively .",
    "to begin with we first consider the local time problem , i.e. , the setup with kernel @xmath43 . in this case",
    "it is possible to derive closed form expressions for a general potential @xmath75 with discontinuity at @xmath56 .",
    "we will use this simple case to illustrate our approach .      as the matching condition ( [ bj0_ch5 ] ) takes care of the singularities at @xmath56 we only need to consider the hierarchy ( [ bd_ch5 ] ) for nonvanishing arguments , i.e. , we can confine our study to the homogeneous equation ( [ by_ch5 ] ) .",

    "from the perspective of large deviation results it is of interest to look at the asymptotic properties of the higher order cumulamnts as well .",
    "of course they can be worked out rather straightforwardly from the expression ( [ db0_ch5 ] ) .",

    "let us now add viscous friction to the setup discussed in the previous subsection .",
