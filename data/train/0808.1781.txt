    "the appearance of spin degrees of freedom in atomic matter waves opens up possibilities for new phenomena such as spin waves  @xcite , spontaneous magnetization  @xcite and spin mixing  @xcite .",
    "however , perhaps the most intriguing effect is associated with complex patterns , such as spin textures  @xcite or domains  @xcite , which may appear either as stationary low - energy states or emerge spontaneously due to condensate instabilities .",
    "pattern formation is a common feature in the dynamics of extended nonlinear systems ranging from optics  @xcite to fluids  @xcite .",
    "such patterns often develop through the exponential growth of unstable spatial modulations , known as _",
    "modulational instability_. in the spinor condensates we have the opportunity to examine such effects in an environment which is remarkably easy to control and manipulate , simply through the addition of an external magnetic field .",
    "the origin of the intriguing physics of spinor condensates lies in the spin interaction between atoms , which allows for an exchange of atoms between different spin components .",
    "the parametric nature of this interaction mirrors similar effects observed in nonlinear optics , where the interaction of several optical modes may lead to the development of new frequencies  @xcite .",
    "of particular interest to our case is the possibility that instabilities of an intense light beam may occur even when the wave is coupled to a spatially stable eigenmode and propagates in the normal - dispersion regime  @xcite ; in this case the interplay of natural and self - induced birefringence leads to nonlinear polarization symmetry breaking and _ polarization modulational instability_. by analogy we thus might expect similar instabilities in an initially stable polar condensate subjected to additional spin component coupling through an external magnetic field .    in the absence of an external magnetic field , the development of spatial modulational instability in three - component ( or spin-1 ) _ ferromagnetic",
    "_ condensates and the subsequent formation of spin domains has been well established both theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite .",
    "however , early work on the zero field case  @xcite determined that antiferromagnetic ( or polar ) condensates are _ modulationally stable_. experimental observations suggested this is also true for a weak magnetic field , however these experiments were carried out with a condensate smaller than a spin domain  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we reveal that in fact the presence of a weak magnetic field ( @xmath0 mg ) leads to spin domain formation in antiferromagnetic condensates , provided the condensate is larger than the spin healing length .",
    "furthermore we show that this spin domain formation is initiated by a _ new type of modulational instability _ , reminiscent of instabilities observed in nonlinear optics  @xcite and not seen before in bose - einstein condensates .",
    "while spin - domain formation in antiferromagnetic condensates has been observed before in the presence of a magnetic field gradient  @xcite , we show here that it occurs equally well in the presence of a homogeneous magnetic field .",
    "furthermore we reveal that this modulational instability and spontaneous spin - domain formation is associated with stationary states which exist in the presence of the weak magnetic field , and which intrinsically break the validity of the single - mode approximation ( as seen earlier in @xcite ) .",
    "we discuss realistic experimental conditions for the observation of these novel effects .",
