    "it is usually stated that at any finite non - zero temperature , thermal fluctuations suppress quantum fluctuations and for that reason the latter can exist only at absolute zero or very low temperatures . with the progress in quantifying entanglement @xcite or quantum correlations , we have now a precise method for determining exactly at what temperatures quantum correlations cease to exist .",
    "this problem has been investigated extensively under the name `` thermal entanglement '' in many body quantum systems @xcite .",
    "the term is usually used to specify the amount of entanglement or genuine quantum correlation which exists between two parts of a system when the whole system is in a state of thermal equilibrium .",
    "one is interested in how this quantity depends on the coupling constants of the system and the temperature .",
    "usually there is a threshold temperature above which entanglement vanishes . in some rare cases",
    "it is even observed that raising the temperature first increases the quantum correlation and then begins to diminish it @xcite . in this way by a quantitative treatment of the problem we are able to sharpen our intuitive notions on the effect of temperature on quantum correlations .",
    "+ in addition to these purely theoretical considerations , these works are also motivated by the proposals in which spins in solid state systems play the role of qubits @xcite and the fact that thermal entanglement seems to be stable against de - coherence and needs no controlled switching for its generation .",
    "+ in this regard in the past few years many types of spin systems have been studied , which include , the heisenberg rings with ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic coupling in the absence and presence of magnetic fields , small clusters of spins with different types of isotropic and anisotropic coupling in homogeneous and in - homogeneous magnetic fields .",
    "these are only a small sample of the works which have been done in this direction .",
    "there are also other works which take into account other forms of interactions between the spins .",
    "+ obtaining exact results on thermal entanglement in spin systems on arbitrary lattices is extremely difficult , since this generally requires a knowledge of different correlation functions which in turn requires a knowledge of the full spectrum of the system .",
    "however in certain systems with extra symmetries one can obtain some partial and interesting results @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper we want to study in some considerable detail thermal entanglement of spins in mean field clusters of arbitrary sizes .",
    "these are clusters in which every spin is coupled to every other spin with equal strength .",
    "such an study has a two - fold motivation .",
    "first , mean field systems are amenable to exact analytical treatment since as we will see , one can determine the entanglement by the sole knowledge of energy eigenvalues , i.e. the partition function , and second they are the first approximation that one uses to study other models .",
    "therefore the results which are obtained for entanglement in these systems , may be good approximations for their corresponding results on other lattices specially when the coordination number of the latter is high .",
    "+ we would like to stress that in all these considerations we are concerned with the thermal state of the system which at zero temperature approaches an equal mixture of various ground states , if there is a degeneracy in the spectrum . for the entanglement properties of the ground states of @xmath7 mean field clusters",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "+ in these works a general class of mean field models under the name collective models have been considered and the entanglement properties of their ground states with particular emphasis to its relation with quantum phase transitions have been studied . + the structure and the results of this paper are as follows : in section [ model ] we introduce the model which consists of a system of @xmath0 spin one - half particles interacting with each other and placed in an external magnetic field .",
    "the interaction may be of ferromagnetic or anti - ferromagnetic type and there may also be present some degree of anisotropy in the couplings of spins in different directions .",
    "we obtain general formulas for the thermal entanglement of this model derived from its partition function . in the following sections we study in detail special cases of the model ,",
    "that is , in section [ xxx ] we consider the isotropic ( or @xmath1 model ) without magnetic field for both ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic interactions , where we show that only the anti - ferromagnetic cluster of @xmath2 spins shows entanglement . in section [ xxxb ]",
    "we study the effect of magnetic field in the @xmath1 model and show that the ferromagnetic clusters show no entanglement while anti - ferromagnetic clusters have entanglement in certain regions of the @xmath4 plane , the plane of magnetic field and temperature .",
    "finally in section [ xxz ] we consider the anisotropic ( @xmath5 model ) without magnetic field .",
    "for an @xmath2 cluster both the ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic interactions produce entanglement , however remarkably for @xmath6 we see that only ferromagnetic clusters show entanglement and no entanglement develops in anti - ferromagnetic clusters .",
    "we determine the regions in the @xmath8 plane , the plane of the anisotropy and temperature where entanglement is non zero . in all cases",
    "we determine the dependence of the entanglement in terms of the size of the cluster .",
    "needless to say in a mean field cluster the entanglement between any two spins is very low compared to the chain , due to the large number of neighbors of a site .",
    "therefore we use the re - scaled concurrence @xcite , the ordinary concurrence scaled by the number of neighbors to measure the degree of entanglement of a cluster .",
    "consider a cluster of spin @xmath9 particles in an external magnetic field and interacting with each other .",
    "we take the hamiltonian as @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 s are pauli operators .",
    "the coupling constant is taken as @xmath13 to ensure an extensive total energy .",
    "we also set @xmath14 for ferromagnetic and @xmath15 for anti - ferromagnetic clusters and without loss of generality @xmath3 is taken positive .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 determines the anisotropy of the interaction .",
    "for @xmath17 we have an isotropic ( @xmath1 system which in the absence of external magnetic field displays full @xmath18 symmetry .",
    "this system is exactly solvable since one can rewrite it in terms of the total spin operators @xmath19 in the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 and we have ignored an additive constant . note that in studying the ground state properties where one can restrict to a fixed spin sector ( i.e. @xmath22 ) , the model is equivalent to the lipkin - meshkov - glick model @xcite which has been extensively studied in @xcite .",
    "however for the thermal entanglement properties of the model one should take into account all spin sectors and the above equivalence no longer holds .    for any system of spins having the symmetry @xmath23=0",
    "$ ] , it has been shown @xcite that the reduced density matrix between two spins is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 and we have ignored the labels indicating the two sites in question which for the mean field cluster can be any two sites .",
    "here @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the spin - spin correlation functions and the magnetization per site respectively .",
    "@xmath28 ( note that there is slight difference between our notations and that of @xcite who take @xmath29 ) .",
    "for such a density matrix the concurrence is given by @xcite @xmath30.\\ ] ] from which one can obtain the entanglement of formation ( eof ) from @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
    "we now note that @xmath33 is real .",
    "this can be proved by resorting to the reality of the hamiltonian and hence the reality of the total and the reduced density matrices .",
    "it is worth mentioning that when the interaction strengths between the @xmath34 , and the @xmath35 terms are not equal , the symmetry @xmath36=0 $ ] will no longer hold and the reduced density matrix will not be of the form ( [ rho ] ) . for these cases one can resort to a recent conjecture of @xcite who provide the closed form of the concurrence for general models having permutation symmetry . +",
    "thus the concurrence can be expressed solely in terms of the correlation functions @xmath37.\\ ] ] the magnetization per site @xmath27 , and the energy per site @xmath38 are obtained from the partition function as follows : @xmath39    the correlation function @xmath40 is obtained from either of the following relations :    @xmath41,\\cr g_{zz}&= & - \\frac{1}{nj\\beta}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\delta}\\ln z-\\frac{1}{4(n-1)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the other correlation function @xmath42 is obtained from @xmath43 where we have used the exchange symmetry between all the pairs in the cluster .",
    "thus from ( [ mu , corr ] ) and ( [ epsilon ] ) we can determine all the correlation functions which are necessary for the calculation of the concurrence .",
    "+ the partition function is found from the following formula    @xmath44    where we have ignored a multiplicative constant and the lower limit of the sum begins from @xmath45 for even ( odd ) @xmath0 and @xmath46 is the number of times a spin @xmath47 representation appears in the decomposition of the tensor product of @xmath0 copies of spin @xmath9 representations .",
    "note that we have to make a distinction between odd and even number of sites @xmath0 , since for even @xmath0 ( odd @xmath0 ) only integer ( half - integer ) spins appear in the decomposition .",
    "we have now set up the required equations and are ready to analyze various situations .",
    "first we consider the isotropic model in zero magnetic field .",
    "in this case we have @xmath48 . for a finite cluster we have no spontaneous magnetization and hence @xmath49 . moreover by rotational symmetry we have @xmath50",
    ". therefore we find from ( [ c ] ) that    @xmath51=2\\ \\   { \\rm max } \\",
    "\\left [ 0,\\   \\frac{2}{3}\\mid x \\mid -      \\mid \\frac{1}{4}+ \\frac{x}{3}\\mid \\right],\\ ] ]    where we have abbreviated @xmath52 to @xmath34 .",
    "we now note that any state with total spin @xmath47 has an energy given by @xmath53 from which we can derive a bound for the variable @xmath54 .",
    "this bound is obtained by considering the maximum and the minimum values of @xmath47 , respectively given by @xmath55 and @xmath56 for even ( odd ) @xmath0 . @xmath57",
    "on the other hand it is readily seen that the function @xmath58 satisfies the following bound @xmath59 combination of ( [ x ] ) and ( [ fx ] ) shows that there is no entanglement for any isotropic cluster for @xmath60 .",
    "we can also exclude the ferromagnetic @xmath2 cluster by noting that for such a cluster @xmath61 ( sine at infinitely high temperatures @xmath62 , consequently at lower temperatures @xmath61 ) and @xmath63 making the fraction @xmath34 a positive number .",
    "thus we arrive at the result that + _ the only isotropic mean field cluster which can be entangled at non - zero temperature is the @xmath2 anti - ferromagnetic cluster . _",
    "+ it had already been shown @xcite that in the class of anti - ferromagnetic rings , the @xmath64 case does not show entanglement , here we see that this is a special case of a more general result which holds for all mean field clusters , including @xmath64 clusters as a special case .",
    "in the presence of magnetic field , the model will no longer have the @xmath65 symmetry and the relation @xmath66 no longer holds . however one can use ( [ z ] ) and calculate the partition function which now takes the form    @xmath67    all the required correlation functions can be obtained exactly , but can not be written in terms of short expressions .",
    "the concurrence is obtained numerically .",
    "the result is that no thermal entanglement develops in the ferromagnetic clusters but for anti - ferromagnetic clusters , there is entanglement which generally but not always diminishes by increasing temperature . figures ( [ 3sites ] ) and ( [ 4siteslastlast ] ) show the thermal entanglement of @xmath64 and @xmath68 clusters as functions of temperature and magnetic field . in both of them",
    "we see that there are regions in the @xmath4 plane where an increase of temperature first increases the entanglement and then tends to decease the entanglement .",
    "the maximum entanglement exists at zero temperature and inside a certain interval of magnetic field values .",
    "xxx cluster , a tetrahedron of anti - ferromagnetic spins , as a function of temperature and magnetic field.,width=302,height=302 ]    in order to depict the typical information contained in these two figures for different cluster sizes , we refer the reader to figures ( [ isotropicb ] ) and ( [ regions ] ) .",
    "figure ( [ isotropicb ] ) shows the entanglement at very low temperatures ( t=0.01 ) for @xmath1 clusters as a function of magnetic field @xmath3 , for cluster sizes .",
    "it is seen that by increasing the size of clusters , the interval for which there is entanglement shrinks to a vanishingly small interval centered around @xmath69 .",
    "figure ( [ regions ] ) shows the region in the @xmath4 plane in which the cluster is entangled .",
    "the region becomes smaller and smaller as the size of the cluster increases .",
    "the right - tilted shape of these regions indicates that in certain intervals of magnetic fields one can generate entanglement simply by increasing the temperature .",
    "the physical reason is that when the magnetic field is high , the ground state is a state with all the spins aligned in the direction of magnetic field and hence there is no entanglement at zero temperature .",
    "slightly increasing the temperature mixes the entangled excited states with the ground state and generates entanglement .",
    "finally figure ( [ pointplot ] ) shows the maximum re - scaled concurrence for clusters of different sizes .",
    "by re - scaled concurrence we mean the concurrence between two sites multiplied by @xmath70 which is the number of neighbors of a given site .",
    "it is seen that there is almost no entanglement for clusters of size larger than 23 .    .",
    "for @xmath71 , the concurrence vanishes . , width=302,height=302 ]    this concludes our investigation of the @xmath1 clusters in magnetic field .",
    "we now turn to another type of anisotropy , namely the @xmath5 clusters in which the anisotropy is not brought about by an external magnetic field .",
    "for these clusters we find a surprising results : except for @xmath2 , the anti - ferromagnetic clusters show no entanglement under any condition , regardless of the value @xmath16 and @xmath72 .",
    "however ferromagnetic clusters show entanglement for all negative values of the anisotropy parameter @xmath16 .",
    "we do not report the result for the @xmath2 ferromagnetic cluster , since this has been reported elsewhere @xcite and focus instead on clusters of arbitrary sizes .",
    "+ the entanglement of a ferromagnetic cluster of size @xmath73 is shown in figure ( [ anisoevensample20 ] ) .",
    "this figure is typical , that is all the ferromagnetic clusters have a similar behavior .",

    "figure ( [ anisoevencombined ] ) and ( [ anisooddcombined ] ) show the entanglement at very low temperature , i.e. @xmath74 , for even and odd size clusters as a function of @xmath16 .",
    "note the difference in trends , that is , for even size clusters as @xmath0 increases the re - scaled concurrence decreases while for odd size clusters , as @xmath0 increases the re - scaled concurrence increases .",
    "the two figures suggest that in the limit @xmath75 , the re - scaled concurrence approaches a curve which we redraw in figure ( [ limit ] ) .",
    "the insets in these figures i.e. figures ( [ anisoevencombined ] ) and ( [ anisooddcombined ] ) show the regions in the @xmath8 plane below which thermal entanglement exists for different clusters . for both even and odd size clusters , as the size of the cluster increases ,",

    "this gives the concurrence to be    @xmath113    therefore this cluster is entangled only for negative values of @xmath16 and for ferromagnetic interaction .",
    "+ let us see why at zero or very low temperature a ferromagnetic cluster shows entanglement in the limit of very large and negative @xmath16 , despite the ising like appearance of the interaction .",
    "the reason is that in this case , the hamiltonian approaches @xmath114 .",
    "since @xmath115 , the lowest energy states are those with @xmath116 , and these states , as shown in figure ( [ ferrospectrum_1 ] ) are the states @xmath117 which are highly entangled .",
    "one may now ask why the same phenomena does not happen in the anti - ferromagnetic case for very large positive @xmath16 , for which the hamiltonian takes a similar form ?",
    "the reason is that as shown in figure ( [ antiferrospectrum_1 ] ) the ground state is now a _",
    "mixture _ of four @xmath118 states , and this mixture does not have any entanglement , although the states themselves may be entangled .",
    "we have done a rather detailed study of the pairwise entanglement properties of a mean field cluster of spin one - half particles interacting via the heisenberg @xmath5 interaction .",
    "we have considered the ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic interactions and the isotropic ( @xmath1 ) and anisotropic @xmath119 cases with and without magnetic field . in each case",
    "we have determined the dependence of entanglement on various parameters like the external magnetic field , the anisotropy parameter , the cluster size as well as temperature .",
    "it has already been shown that , although the two particle concurrence of the ground state vanishes in the thermodynamic limit , the re - scaled concurrence does not vanish and shows quite interesting and nontrivial behavior @xcite .",
    "some of our results ( figures ( [ anisoevencombined ] ) and ( [ anisooddcombined ] ) ) shows that as the size of clusters approach infinity , the re - scaled concurrence at non - zero temperature approaches a specific function of the control parameters . in a future work",
    "we will focus on the thermodynamic limit of these clusters to investigate these functions where we should also take into account the possibility of spontaneous magnetization and symmetry breaking .",
