    "observatory in 1983 @xcite , and were confirmed by _ rosat _  and  _ asca _ measurements in 1997 @xcite .",
    "these x - ray lobes are believed to have been formed by the jets emitted from ss433 , as they are symmetrical about ss433 and lie along the same axis as that defined by the east - west elongation of the w50 radio shell and are within the precession cone of the ss433 jets .",
    "initial _ rosat _  and",
    "_ asca _ measurements of the spectra of these x - ray lobes were compatible with both power - law model and thermal models  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , however , the _ asca _ team reported harder power - low spectra of the western x - ray lobe in 2000 .",
    "the spectra were found to become softer with distance from ss433 within the range of the photon index from @xmath21 to @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "they also reported that the thermal model is acceptable only when an unusually low metal abundance is assumed .",
    "this indicated that the x - ray emissions of the western x - ray lobe have a non - thermal origin .",
    "these results were consistent with the picture that the high energy electrons are generated at the sides of the x - ray lobes closest to ss433 , with the electrons losing their energy by the synchrotron emission as they travel further from ss433 .",
    "the _ asca _",
    "results suggest that very high energy electrons with energies up to several hundred tev are expected to be produced through shock acceleration in the x - ray lobes , and the vhe gamma ray emissions are expected to be generated through the inverse - compton ( ic ) scattering .    in 2005 ,",

    "the data were obtained by on source observations tracking the source position , and by off source observations for the background .",
    "on source observations were timed to contain the meridian passage of the target , as was done by enomoto et al .",

    "therefore , shock acceleration may be present in this region and the emission of the vhe gamma rays may result .    using the 10 m cangaroo - ii telescope , we have searched for gamma rays in the vhe region from the western part of the x - ray lobe of ss433/w50 system",
