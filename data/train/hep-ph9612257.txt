    "there is a strong historical basis for the consideration of composite models which is presently mirrored in the proliferation of fundamental particles . in attempts to explain the repetition of generations or the large number of arbitrary parameters within the standard model ( sm ) , several levels of substructure have been considered@xcite , including composite fermions , higgs bosons , and even weak bosons . here",
    "we focus on the possibility that leptons and quarks are bound states of more fundamental constituents , often referred to as preons in the literature .",
    "the preon binding force should be confining at a mass scale @xmath11 which also characterizes the radius of the bound states .",
    "experimentally , @xmath11 is constrained to be at least in the tev range .",
    "theoretically , numerous efforts have been made to construct realistic models for composite fermions , but no consistent or compelling theory which accounts for @xmath12 presently exists . at energies above @xmath11 the composite nature of fermions would be revealed by the break - up of the bound states in hard scattering processes . at lower energies , deviations from the sm may be observed via form factors or residual effective interactions induced by the binding force .",
    "these composite remnants are usually parameterized by the introduction of contact terms in the low - energy lagrangian .",
    "more generally , four fermion contact interactions represent a useful parameterization of many types of new physics originating at a high energy scale , such as the exchange of new gauge bosons , leptoquarks , or excited particles , or the existence of anomalous couplings .",
    "these contact interactions are described by non - renormalizable operators in the effective low - energy lagrangian .",
    "the lowest order four - fermion contact terms are dimension-6 and hence have dimensionful coupling constants proportional to @xmath13 .",
    "the fermion currents are restricted to be helicity conserving , flavor diagonal , and @xmath14 invariant .",
    "these terms can be written most generally as@xcite @xmath15 where the generation and color indices have been suppressed , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is inserted to allow for different quark and lepton couplings but is anticipated to be @xmath18 . since the binding force is expected to be strong when @xmath19 approaches @xmath20 , it is conventional to define @xmath21 .",
    "the subscript @xmath22 indicates that the currents in each parenthesis can be either left- or right - handed and various possible choices of the chiralities lead to different predictions for the angular distributions of the reactions where the contact terms contribute .",
    "interference between the contact terms and the usual gauge interactions can lead to observable deviations from sm predictions at energies lower than @xmath11 .",
    "they can affect _",
    "e.g. _ , jet production at hadron colliders , the drell - yan process , or lepton scattering .",
    "the size of this interference term relative to the sm amplitude is @xmath23 , where @xmath24 represents the strength of the relevant gauge coupling .",
    "one may hence neglect modifications of the gauge couplings due to form factors .",
    "it is clear that the effects of the contact interactions will be most important in the phase space region with large @xmath19 . at hadron",
    "colliders these terms manifest themselves in the high @xmath25 region in jet and lepton - pair production and deviations from the sm can unfortunately often become entangled in the uncertainties associated with the parton densities@xcite .",
    "cdf has recently constrained@xcite @xmath26 contact interactions from the measurement of the dijet angular distribution ; it is found to be in good agreement with qcd , thereby excluding at 95 % c.l . a contact interaction among the up and down",
    "type quarks with scale @xmath27 tev or @xmath28 tev .",
    "composite scales of 25 tev can be reached in future runs at the tevatron@xcite and a search limit for @xmath11 in the 1520 tev range is expected at the lhc @xcite .",
    "cdf also found the restrictions@xcite @xmath29 tev and @xmath30 tev at 95% c.l . on @xmath31 contact interactions from @xmath32 of data on drell - yan production .",
    "run ii of the tevatron is expected to improve these limits to @xmath33 tev .",
    "hera also constrains @xmath31 contact terms , with the exclusion@xcite from h1 of @xmath34 tev at 95% c.l . , where the range takes into account various helicity combinations . a review of the bounds on four lepton contact interactions from pep",
    ", petra , tristan , and aleph is given in buskulic _",
    "et al._@xcite , but are superseded by recent results from opal at @xmath35 gev which bounds @xmath11 in the range @xmath36 tev ( again , for the various helicity states ) from @xmath37 and combined @xmath38 pair production @xcite .",
    "this search also constrains @xmath39 tev and @xmath40 tev at 95% c.l . from identified b - quark final states .",
    "there is an earlier analysis@xcite of @xmath41 contact terms from the forward - backward asymmetry of @xmath42 and @xmath43 mesons which yields a bound of @xmath44 tev .    in this contribution , we study the compositeness search reach on @xmath0 and @xmath1 contact terms using the processes @xmath45 where @xmath46 or @xmath47 at future lepton colliders .",
    "we shall consider @xmath3 colliders with center of mass energy 0.5 , 1 , 1.5 , 5 tev and luminosity 50 , 200 , 200 , 1000 fb@xmath48 , respectively , as well as muon colliders with @xmath49 tev and luminosity 0.7 , 50 , and 1000 fb@xmath48 .",
    "we build on earlier studies@xcite of compositeness searches at lepton colliders .",
    "the reactions @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( @xmath53 proceed via @xmath54-channel exchanges of @xmath55 and @xmath56 bosons , as well as the @xmath57 contact interaction .",
    "thus , not only the squared term of the contact interaction but also the interference terms between the @xmath55 , @xmath56 exchanges and the contact interaction will contribute to the differential cross section and yield deviations from the sm .",
    "we explicitly rewrite the contact terms for @xmath58 @xmath59 \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the polarized differential cross sections for @xmath60 are @xmath61 @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the scattering angle in the center of mass frame and @xmath64 represents the color factor being the usual 3(1 ) for quarks(leptons ) .",
    "the helicity amplitudes are @xmath65 with @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the sine and cosine of the weak mixing angle , and @xmath70 and @xmath71 represent the fermion s charge and third component of the weak isospin , respectively .",
    "the expressions for @xmath72 and @xmath73 can be obtained by interchanging @xmath74 .",
    "the use of polarized beams , combined with the angular distributions , can thus clearly determine the helicity of the contact term .",
    "the unpolarized differential cross section is given simply by @xmath75\\,.\\ ] ] the polarized and unpolarized total cross sections are obtained by integrating over @xmath76 , resulting in the spin - averaged unpolarized cross section : @xmath77\\,.\\ ] ] the forward - backward and left - right asymmetries are easily obtained and can be written as @xmath78 figure  1 displays the @xmath76 distribution for @xmath79 at @xmath80 tev for the sm and with a contact term present .",
    "the effects of a contact term are qualitatively similar for other final states . in all curves we set @xmath81 . in fig .",
    "1a we take @xmath82  tev which shows that a finite value of @xmath11 alters the angular distribution particularly in the forward direction .",
    "1b displays the angular distributions for right - handed polarized electrons .",
    "although the effects of contact interactions are more dramatic here , because the right - handed cross section is smaller , the relative contribution of right - handed contact terms will be smaller in unpolarized cross sections .",
    "thus , not only will polarization be important for disentangling the helicity structure of a contact interaction should deviations be seen , but polarization will also enhance the sensitivity to contact interactions . in fig .",
    "1c distributions are shown for @xmath83 and @xmath84 demonstrating that opposite signs for the @xmath85 s results in opposite interference . finally , in fig .",
    "1d the angular distribution is shown for @xmath86 but with @xmath87 5  tev , 10  tev , 20  tev , and 30  tev to give a feeling for the sensitivity to the scale of new physics .",
    "we note that the effects of the contact term on @xmath88 are relatively small when all quark flavors are summed , compared to the individual deviations in _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath89 or @xmath90 , because cancelations occur in the interference term between the up - type and down - type quarks .",
    "we thus concentrate on the heavy quark final states , taking a 60% identification efficiency for detecting b - quarks and 35% identification efficiency for detecting c - quarks at the nlc@xcite .",
    "the detection efficiency of heavy flavor final states at a muon collider has yet to be determined , but is expected to be worse than what can be achieved at the nlc due to the inability to put a vertex detector close to the interaction point and due to the heavier backgrounds .",
    "for now we assume canonical lep values , @xmath91 for the muon collider but warn the reader that these numbers are quite arbitrary and are only used for illustrative purposes .",
    "we assume 100% identification efficiency for leptons .",
    "although we do not take into account the purity of the tagged heavy flavor samples in our results , we note that the purities that can be achieved at a linear collider are higher than can be achieved at lep .",
    "to gauge the sensitivity to the compositeness scale we assume that the sm is correct and perform a @xmath92 analysis of the @xmath76 angular distribution . to perform this we choose the detector acceptance to be @xmath93 ( corresponding to @xmath94 ) for the @xmath3 collider and @xmath95 ( corresponding to @xmath96 ) for the muon collider@xcite .",
    "we note that angular acceptance of a typical muon collider detector is expected to be reduced due to additional shielding required to minimize the radiation backgrounds from the muon beams .",
    "we then divide the angular distribution into 10 equal bins .",
    "the @xmath92 distribution is evaluated by the usual expression : @xmath97 ^ 2\\ ] ] where @xmath98 is the luminosity and @xmath99 is the efficiency for detecting the final state under consideration which is discussed above . for polarized beams we assume @xmath100 of the total integrated luminosity listed in the tables for each polarization .",
    "we assume that only one of the @xmath85 s is nonzero at a time .",
    "the 95% c.l .",
    "bounds on @xmath11 are tabulated in tables i , ii , and iii .",
    "generally , high luminosity @xmath101 and @xmath5 colliders are quite sensitive to contact interactions with discovery limits ranging from 5 to 50 times the center of mass energy . for unpolarized beams with leptons in the final state ,",
    "the slightly higher sensitivity to contact interactions at @xmath101 colliders than at @xmath5 colliders with the same @xmath102 can be attributed to the larger expected acceptance for @xmath3 detectors . for @xmath103 final states",
    "the sensitivities for @xmath101 colliders are roughly 20% higher than for @xmath104 colliders while for @xmath105 final states the difference can be up to a factor of two .",
    "these differences are due to the different tagging efficiencies assumed for @xmath3 and @xmath5 colliders .",
    "polarization in the @xmath3 colliders can offer even higher limits depending on the final state being considered .",
    "more importantly , if deviations are observed polarization would be crucial for determining the chirality of the new interaction .",
    "finally , we note that for @xmath103 and @xmath105 final states sometimes very specific , relatively low values of @xmath11 , give rise to angular distributions indistinguisiable from the sm .",
    "however , we expect that these values will be ruled out by other measurements before high energy lepton colliders become operational so we only include the higher values in the tables .",
    "in this report we presented the results of a preliminary study on the sensitivity to contact interactions at future high energy @xmath101 and @xmath5 colliders . depending on the specific collider and final state",
    ", contact interactions can be detected up to 5 - 50 times the center of mass energy of the collider with the lowest number coming from the low luminosity 500  gev @xmath5 collider and the highest numbers from high luminosity @xmath3 colliders with polarization .",
    "these results should be taken as preliminary .",
    "first and foremost the sensitivities were based only on statistical errors and systematic errors were not included .",
    "in addition , a more thorough analysis should include potentially important effects like initial state radiation and should consider heavy quark final state purities .",
    "these considerations are under study and will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
