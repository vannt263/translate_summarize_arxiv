    "the concept of logical depth was introduced by c. bennett @xcite to differentiate useful information ( such as dna ) from the rest , with the key observation that non - useful information pertains in both very simple structures ( for example , a crystal ) and completely unstructured data ( for example , a random sequence , a gas ) .",
    "bennett calls data containing useful information logically deep data , whereas both trivial structures and fully random data are called shallow .",
    "the notion of useful information ( as defined by logical depth ) strongly contrasts with classical information theory , which views random data as having high information content .",
    "i.e. , according to classical information theory , a random noise signal contains maximal information , whereas from the logical depth point of view , such a signal contains very little useful information .",
    "bennett s logical depth notion is based on kolmogorov complexity .",
    "intuitively a logically deep sequence ( or equivalently a set ) is one for which the more time a compressor is given , the better it can compress the sequence .",
    "for example , both on trivial and random sequences , even when given more time , a compressor can not achieve a better compression ratio .",
    "hence trivial and random sequences are not logically deep .    several variants of logical depth have been studied in the past @xcite . as shown in @xcite , all depth notions proposed so far",
    "can be interpreted in the compression framework which says a sequence is deep if given ( arbitrarily ) more than @xmath10 time steps , a compressor can compress the sequence @xmath6 more bits than if given at most @xmath10 time steps only . by considering different time bound families for @xmath10 ( e.g. recursive , polynomial time etc . ) and the magnitude of compression improvement @xmath6 - for short : the _ depth magnitude _ - ( e.g. @xmath11 ) one can capture all existing depth notions @xcite in the compression framework @xcite . e.g. bennett s notion is obtained by considering all recursive time bounds @xmath12 and a constant depth magnitude , i.e. , @xmath13 .",
    "several authors studied variants of bennett s notion , by considering different time bounds and/or different depth magnitude from bennett s original notion @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the consequences these changes of different parameters in bennett s depth notion entail , by investigating the computational power of the deep sets yielded by each of these depth variants .    *",
    "we found out that the choice of the depth magnitude has consequences on the computational power of the corresponding deep sets .",
    "the fact that computational power implies bennett depth was noticed in @xcite , where it was shown that every high degree contains a bennett deep set ( a set is high if , when given as an oracle , its halting problem is at least as powerful as the halting problem relative to the halting problem : @xmath14 is high iff @xmath15 ) .",
    "we show that the converse also holds , i.e. , that depth implies computational power , by proving that if the depth magnitude is chosen to be `` large '' ( i.e. , @xmath7 ) , then depth coincides with highness ( on the turing degrees ) , i.e. , a turing degree is high iff it contains a deep set of magnitude @xmath7 . * for smaller choices of @xmath5 , for example ,",
    "if @xmath5 is any recursive order function , depth still retains some computational power : we show that depth implies either highness or diagonally - non - recursiveness , denoted dnr ( a total function is dnr if its image on input @xmath16 is different from the output of the @xmath16-th turing machine on input @xmath16 ) .",
    "this implies that if we restrict ourselves to left - r.e .",
    "sets , recursive order depth already implies highness . we also show that highness is not necessary by constructing a low order - deep set ( a set is low if it is not powerful when given as an oracle ) .",
    "* as a corollary , our results imply that weakly - useful sets introduced in @xcite are either high or dnr ( set @xmath17 is weakly - useful if the class of sets reducible to it within a fixed time bound @xmath18 does not have measure zero within the class of recursive sets ) .",
    "* bennett s depth @xcite is defined using prefix - free kolmogorov complexity .",
    "two key properties of bennett s notion are the so - called slow growth law , which stipulates that no shallow set can quickly ( truth - table ) compute a deep set , and the fact that neither martin - lf random nor recursive sets are deep .",
    "it is natural to ask whether replacing prefix - free with plain complexity in bennett s formulation yields a meaningful depth notion .",
    "we call this notion plain - depth .",
    "we show that the random is not deep paradigm also holds in the setting of plain - depth . on the other hand",
    "we show that the slow growth law fails for plain - depth : every many - one degree contains a set which is not plain - deep of magnitude @xmath19 . *",
    "a key property of depth is that `` easy '' sets should not be deep .",
    "bennett @xcite showed that no recursive set is deep .",
    "we give an improvement to this result by observing that no @xmath4-trivial set is deep ( a set is @xmath4-trivial if the complexity of its prefixes is as low as possible ) .",
    "our result is close to optimal , since there exist deep ultracompressible sets @xcite . * in most depth notions , the depth magnitude has to be achieved almost everywhere on the set .",
    "some feasible depth notions also considered an infinitely often version @xcite .",
    "bennett noticed in @xcite that infinitely often depth is meaningless because every recursive set is infinitely often deep .",
    "we propose an alternative infinitely often depth notion that does nt suffer this limitation ( called i.o .",

    "for hyperimmune - free sets we prove that every non - recursive , non - dnr hyperimmune - free set is i.o .",

    "our results show that the choice of the magnitude for logical depth has consequences on the computational power of the corresponding deep sets , and that larger depth magnitude is not necessarily preferable over smaller magnitude .",
