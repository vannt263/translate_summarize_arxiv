    "baryon matter of the universe is mainly in the form of intergalactic medium ( igm ) , of which the dynamics can be described as compressible fluid .",
    "luminous objects are formed from baryon matter in the gravitational well of dark matter .",
    "therefore , the dynamical state of baryon fluid in nonlinear regime is crucial to understand the formation and evolution of the large scale structures of the universe . in the linear regime ,",
    "the baryon fluid follows the mass and velocity fields of collisionless dark matter . in the nonlinear regime , however , the baryon fluid statistically decouples from the underlying dark matter field . the statistical behavior of baryon fluid is no longer described by a similar mapping of the underlying dark matter field ( e.g. pando et al . 2004 ) .",
    "it was first pointed out by shandarin and zeldovich ( 1989 ) that the dynamical behavior of baryon matter clustering on large scales is similar to turbulence .",
    "the expansion of the universe eliminates the gravity of uniformly distributed dark matter .",
    "the motion of baryon matter on scales larger than dissipation is like that of matter moving by inertia . in this regime ,",
    "the evolution of baryon matter is scale - free and dynamically like fully developed turbulence in inertial range .",
    "the turbulence of incompressible fluid leads the energy passes from large to the smallest eddies , and finally dissipates into thermal motion . while the clustering of cosmic baryon fluid is also due to the transform of density perturbations on different scales , and finally falls and dissipates into virialized halos of dark matter . yet",
    ", the turbulence of incompressible fluid is rotational ( landau & lifshitz 1987 ) , while the clustering of cosmic matter is irrotational , because vorticities do not grow in an expanding universe ( peebles 1980 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the turbulence - like behavior of cosmic baryon fluid has been gradually noticed .",
    "first , the dynamics of growth modes of the cosmic matter is found to be sketched by a stochastic force driven by burger s equation ( gurbatov , et al 1989 , berera & fang , 1994 ) .",
    "the burger s equation driven by the random force of the gravity of dark matter can also sketch the evolution of baryon fluid , if cooling and heating are ignored ( jones 1999 ; matarrese & mohayaee 2002 ) .",
    "later , the burger s fluid is found to show turbulence behavior if the reynolds number is large enough ( polyakov 1995 ; lassig 2000 ; bec & frisch 2000 ; davoudi et al .",
    "the reynolds number of igm at nonlinear regime actually is large .",
    "therefore , we may expect that , in the scale free range , the dynamical state of cosmic baryon fluid should be burger s turbulence .",
    "the turbulence of burger s fluid is different from the turbulence of incompressible fluid .",
    "the later consists of vortices on various scales , while the former is a collection of shocks .    with the cosmological hydrodynamic simulation based on navier - stokes equations in which heating and cooling processes are properly accounted",
    ", it has been found that the velocity field of the igm consists of an ensemble of shocks , and satisfies some scaling relations predicted by burger s turbulence ( kim et al .",
    "this result reveals that the turbulence features of cosmic baryon fluid are independent of the details of dissipation ( heating and cooling ) mechanism if we consider only the scale free range , i.e. from the scale of the onset of nonlinear evolution to the scale of dissipation , say jeans length .",
    "a new progress is to show that the velocity field of cosmic baryon fluid can extremely well described by she - leveque s ( sl ) scaling formula ( he et al .",
    "the sl formula is considered to be the basic statistical features of the self - similar evolution of fully developed turbulence .",
    "very recently , the non - gaussianities of mass density field of the hydrodynamic simulation samples are found to be well consistent with the predictions of the log - poisson hierarchy , which originates from some hidden symmetry of the navier - stokes equations .",
    "this hierarchical model gives a unified explanation of non - gaussian features of baryon fluid , including the intermittence , hierarchical relation , scale - scale correlations etc ( liu & fang 2008 ) .",
    "these results strongly indicate that , in the scale free range , dynamical state of cosmic baryon fluid is similar to a fully developed turbulence .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the log - poisson hierarchy of cosmic baryon fluid with observed data  the ly@xmath0 transmitted flux of quasar absorption spectrum , which is due to the absorptions of quasar continuum by the diffusely distributed neutral hydrogen ( bi et al 1995 , bi & devidsen 1997 , rauch 1998 ) .",
    "these samples offer a unique way to study the non - gaussian feature of cosmic baryon fluid .",
    "it has been known for a long time that the fields of ly@xmath0 forests and transmitted flux are highly non - gaussian .",
    "observation samples of ly@xmath0 forests and transmitted flux show scale - scale correlation ( pando et al 1998 ) , intermittence ( jamkhedkar et al . 2000 ; pando et al . 2002 ; feng et al .",
    "2003 ) , non - thermal broadening of and ly@xmath0 absorption lines ( zheng et al . 2004 ; liu et al .",
    "we will show that the log - poisson hierarchy provides a crux to understand the non - gaussian behavior .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    " 2 gives an introduction of the log - poisson hierarchy .",
    " 3 shows that the neutral hydrogen component of cosmic baryon fluid is of log - poisson hierarchy . in  4 , we study the log - poisson hierarchy of the field of ly@xmath0 transmitted flux with observed samples of quasar absorption spectra . a comparison between log - poisson hierarchy and log - normal model is also presented in  4 .",
    "the conclusion and discussion are given in  5 .",
    "to describe the statistical properties of an isotropic and homogenous random field @xmath3 , it generally uses correlation functions of @xmath4 , @xmath5 being the mean of density . for instance",
    ", a two - point correlation function is @xmath6 . to reveal the turbulence - like behavior , we use variable @xmath7 , where @xmath8 .",
    "the variable @xmath9 is very different from variable @xmath10 . the later can be larger than @xmath5 , but can not be less than @xmath11 , and therefore , for a nonlinear field , the distribution of @xmath12 generally is skew ; however , the distribution of @xmath9 is symmetric with respect to positive and negative @xmath9 if the field is statistically uniform .    with @xmath10 the clustering and non - gaussianity of mass density @xmath3",
    "are measured by two and multiple point correlation functions of @xmath10 . with @xmath13 ,",
    "the statistical features are described by structure function defined as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the order of statistics , and the average @xmath16 is taken over the ensemble of density field .",
    "a comparison of the correlation function and structure function has been analyzed in detail by monin & yaglom ( 1975 ) .",
    "the 2nd structure function @xmath17 as a function @xmath18 ( scale ) actually is the power spectrum of the mass density field @xmath19 ( fang & feng 2000 ) .    in the scale - free range of the dynamical equations and initial conditions ,",
    "the structure function is scale - invariant , and therefore , it is generally expressed as a power law of @xmath18 @xmath20 @xmath21 is called intermittent exponent . since the pioneer work of kolmogorov ( 1941 ) , it is believed that the relation of @xmath21 vs. @xmath15 is related to the scale - covariance of the dynamical equations and initial conditions . for fully developed turbulence of navier - stokes fluid , @xmath21 is a nonlinear function of @xmath15 .",
    "since then many hierarchy models for interpreting @xmath21 have been proposed ( frisch 1995 ) .",
    "finally the best model is given by the sl scaling formula ( she & leveque 1994 ) , which is yielded from the log - poisson hierarchy process ( dubrulle 1994 ) .",
    "although the cosmic baryon fluid is not incompressible , samples of mass and velocity fields of cosmic baryon fluid produced by the cosmological hydroidynamic simulation of the concordance @xmath1cdm model show in good arrgement with the sl scaling and log - poisson hierarchy .",
    "this is not surprising , because the hierarchical structure model is mainly based on the invariance and symmetry of nonlinear dynamical systems .",
    "therefore , systems other than the navier - stokes incompressible fluid will also show the sz scaling and log - poisson hierarchy if they have the similar invariance and symmetry ( she 1997 ) .",
    "the scenario of hierarchical clustering has been widely used to describe nonlinear evolution of the mass field of cosmic matter",
    ". we will first give the basic assumptions of log - poisson hierarchy cascade , and then discuss the physics behind this model .",
    "the log - poisson hierarchy assumes that , in the scale free range , the variables ( density fluctuation ) @xmath22 on different scales @xmath18 are related by a statistical relation as ( dubrulle 1994 , she & waymire 1995 ) , @xmath23 where @xmath24 in eqs.(3 ) and ( 4 ) , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is a random variable with the poisson pdf as @xmath27 to insure the normalization @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is over @xmath26 , the mean @xmath30 of the poisson distribution should be @xmath31/(1-\\beta).\\ ] ]    the model eq.(3 ) describes how a density fluctuation @xmath32 on larger scale @xmath33 statistically related to fluctuation @xmath34 on smaller scale @xmath35 .",
    "the log - poisson model depends only on the ratio @xmath36 .",
    "thus , it is scale invariant .",
    "the random variable @xmath26 can be considered as the steps of the evolution from @xmath32 to @xmath34 .",
    "when @xmath2 is smaller , only the evolutionary process with lower steps is important .    for a gaussian field , variables @xmath37 and @xmath38 have to be statistically independent .",
    "it likes that the fourier modes with different wavenumber @xmath39 and @xmath40 are statistically independent .",
    "therefore , a gaussian field has to be @xmath41 .",
    "thus , the parameters @xmath42 is a measure of the deviation from gaussian field .",
    "the meaning of @xmath43 will be given later .",
    "among hierarchical clustering models , the log - poisson hierarchy has the following features .",
    "first , the relation between @xmath32 and @xmath34 given by eq.(3 ) is a multiplicative random process .",
    "a random multiplicative cascade generally yields a non - gaussian field .",
    "that is , even the field on large scale @xmath33 is gaussian , it will be non - gaussian on small scale @xmath35 .",
    "this is different from additive random process ( e.g. cole & kaiser 1988 ) , which generally yields gaussian field ( pando et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "second , the cascade from scale @xmath33 to @xmath35 , and then to @xmath44 is identical to the cascade from @xmath33 to @xmath44 .",
    "it is because @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is again a poisson random variable with @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , the log - poisson hierarchy removes an arbitrariness in defining the steps of cascade from @xmath33 to @xmath35 or @xmath35 to @xmath44 .",
    "this arbitrariness is a major shortcoming of many hierarchical clustering models , one of them , for instance , is the clustering hierarchy models ( soneira & peebles 1977 , peebles 1980 ) .",
    "third , although the log - poisson hierarchical process is discrete in terms of the discrete random number @xmath26 , it is infinitely divisible .",
    "that is , there is no lower limit on the difference @xmath48 .",
    "it can be infinitesimal .",
    "this is consistent with the continuous variable @xmath18 used in the hydrodynamic equation of cosmic baryon fluid .",
    "the infinite divisibility can not be modeled with hierarchy of discrete objects with finite size .",
    "log - normal model is also infinitely divisible .",
    "however , their asymptotic behavior of @xmath21 at larger @xmath15 is unbound .",
    "we will compare the log - normal model with log - poisson in  4.4 .",
    "with log - poisson hierarchy eq.(3 ) , the intermittent exponent @xmath21 is found to be ( liu & fang 2008 ) @xmath49.\\ ] ] when @xmath50 , we have @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , @xmath52 is a gaussian field . a field with @xmath42",
    "is called intermittent .",
    "eq.(7 ) requires @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , the difference of an intermittent field from gaussian is mainly given by the term @xmath54 of eq.(7 ) .    from eq.(7 ) , the power spectrum @xmath55 is flat .",
    "this is not generally applicable for the cosmic density field . in the scale free range ,",
    "the power spectrum of mass field is of power - law .",
    "thus , we should generalize the log - poisson hierarchy eq.(3 ) by replacing @xmath37 and @xmath38 with @xmath56 and @xmath57 . in this case , the intermitted exponent @xmath21 is @xmath58.\\ ] ] eqs.(2 ) and ( 7 ) yield @xmath59 , and therefore , the parameter @xmath60 is the index of power spectrum . when @xmath61 , eq.(8 ) is the same as eq.(7 ) .",
    "since @xmath62 is the @xmath15-th moment of the @xmath63 , for high @xmath15 , one can attribute the structure function @xmath64 to the events located at the tail of the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of @xmath63 . to pick up the structures , which dominant the @xmath15-order statistics of @xmath63",
    ", we define @xmath65 from equations ( 2 ) and ( 8) , equation ( 9 ) gives @xmath66 where the constant @xmath67 is independent of @xmath18 and @xmath15 .",
    "for an intermittent field @xmath42 , we have @xmath68 .",
    "thus , from eq.(10 ) , one can find @xmath69^{1/\\beta},\\ ] ]    equation ( 11 ) is invariant with respect to a translation in @xmath15 .",
    "since @xmath70 measures the structures dominating the @xmath15 order statistics , the larger the @xmath15 , the larger the contribution of strong - clustered structures to @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , equation ( 11 ) describes the hierarchical relation between the stronger ( or high @xmath15 ) and weaker ( or low @xmath15 ) clustering . in the scale - free range where @xmath71 , we have @xmath72 if @xmath42 . that is , for an intermittent field , weak clustering structures are strongly suppressed with respect to the strong clustering ; the smaller the @xmath2 , the stronger the suppression of weak clustering structures .    from eq.(11 ) , we have @xmath73 this , for _ all _ @xmath18 and @xmath15 , @xmath74 $ ] vs. @xmath75 $ ] should be on a straight line with slope @xmath2 .",
    "it is called @xmath2-hierarchy .",
    "eq.(12 ) does not contain parameter @xmath43 and term @xmath76 , and therefore , it is a testable prediction of the log - poisson hierarchy .",
    "therefore , log - poisson hierarchy links the sizes of fluctuation structures [ eq.(3 ) ] as well as their amplitude or intensity [ eq.(11 ) ] .",
    "this is different from hierarchy models , which give only the relationship between the sizes of objects .",
    "the hierarchical relation eq.(11 ) actually is the origin of the log - poisson hierarchy .",
    "that is , the hierarchical relation like eq.(11 ) is the first recognized to be held for dynamical system described by the naiver - stokes equations , or equations close to the naiver - stokes fluid ( dubrulle 1994 , leveque & she 1997 ) .",
    "therefore , the sl formula has also been successfully applied to describe the mass fields of compressible fluid ( boldyrev et al 2002 , padoan et al 2003 ) .",
    "the ratio between higher order to second order moments @xmath77 is a popular tool to measure non - gaussianity .",
    "when @xmath78 , the ratio is kurtosis . for a gaussian field , the ratio is independent of @xmath18 , and equal to @xmath79 for log - poisson hierarchy , one can show(liu & fang 2008 ) @xmath80 the moment ratio @xmath81 is linearly dependent on @xmath82 ( scale free ) with the slope @xmath83 given by @xmath84 as expected , for gaussian field @xmath85 , @xmath86 , i.e. the ratio of moments is independent of @xmath18 [ eq.(14 ) ] .",
    "that is , @xmath83 only depends on the last term on the right hand side of eq.(8 ) , regardless the parameter @xmath0 .    other useful non - gaussian detector is the scale - scale correlation defined as @xmath87 which describes the correlation between the density fluctuations on scales @xmath33 and @xmath35",
    "obviously , for a gaussian field , @xmath88 .",
    "the clustering of cosmic large scale structure in the nonlinear regime essentially is due to the interaction between the modes of fluctuations on different scales ( e.g. , peebles 1980 ) .",
    "therefore , it is important to detect the scale - scale correlation of cosmic baryon matter .",
    "if the ratio @xmath89 is fixed , the log - poisson hierarchy predicts the scale - scale correlation to be ( liu & fang 2008 ) @xmath90 where the factor @xmath91 is constant when the ratio @xmath89 is fixed .",
    "this is because the log - poisson model is invariant with respect to scale dilation . from eqs.(7 ) or ( 8) , we have @xmath92 thus ,",
    "if @xmath89 remains constant , the relationship of @xmath93 vs. @xmath94 should be a straight line with slope @xmath95 .",
    "this slop is also only dependent on the last term on the right hand side of eq.(8 ) , regardless the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "ly@xmath0 absorption spectrum depends on the distribution of neutral hydrogen .",
    "we first study the mass density field of diffused neutral hydrogen .",
    "since the uv background radiation is uniform and does not introduce special spatial scale , one may expect that the mass density field of neutral hydrogen is also a field of the log - poisson hierarchy .",
    "however , the ratio of the neutral hydrogen density @xmath96 to total hydrogen density @xmath97 is not spatially constant , because the temperature - density relation is of multiphase ( he et al 2004 , 2005 ) .",
    "therefore , the mass field of the neutral hydrogen would not have the same log - poisson hierarchical features as of @xmath98 .",
    "the simulation samples of the fields of baryon fluid are generated by the same way as liu & fang ( 2008 ) , which is based on the hybrid hydrodynamic n - body code of weighted essentially non - oscillatory ( weno ) scheme ( feng et al . 2004 ) .",
    "it is in eulerian scheme and suitable to analyze the fluid in high as well as in low mass density areas .",
    "the weno samples have been successfully applied to reveal the self - similar hierarchy behavior of cosmic baryon fluid ( kim et al . 2005 ; he et al .",
    "2006 ; liu & fang 2008 ) , to explain the hi and heii ly@xmath0 absorption in quasar spectra ( liu et al .",
    "2006 ) , and to study the relation between x - ray luminosity and temperature of groups of galaxies ( zhang et al . 2006 ) .",
    "it is also used for studying ly@xmath0 leaks at high redshift ( liu et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the simulation is performed in a comoving cubic box of 100 @xmath99 mpc with 512@xmath100 grids and an equal number of dark matter particles .",
    "the grid size is @xmath101 @xmath99 mpc , which is less than jeans length , and therefore , it is enough to catch the statistical behavior in the scale - free range , i.e. larger than the jeans length and less than non - linear scale .",
    "we use the concordance @xmath1cdm cosmology model with parameters @xmath102=0.27 , @xmath103=0.044 , @xmath104=0.73 , @xmath105=0.71 , @xmath106=0.84 , and spectral index @xmath107 .",
    "the transfer function is calculated using cmbfast ( seljak & zaldarriaga 1996 ) .",
    "we take a primordial composition of h and he ( @xmath108=0.76 , @xmath109=0.24 ) .    the ionization fraction is calculated with ionization - recombination equilibrium under a uniform uv radiative background , of which the intensity is adjusted to fit the mean of observed ly@xmath0 tarnsmitted flux .",

    "we randomly sample 10,000 one - dimensional sub - samples to simulate the ly@xmath0 transmitted flux (  4 ) . to estimate the errors , we divided the 10,000 samples into 10 subsamples , each of which has 1,000 line samples",

    "because the scale free range is larger than the jeans length , the effect of thermal broadening would be small in this range . in this case , eq.(20 ) can be approximately as @xmath178dx.\\ ] ] this relation actually is a mapping from a physical space field @xmath167 to redshift space field @xmath163 , which is the same as that used in the redshift distortion of galaxy distribution .",
    "it has been shown that , with the dwt variables , the redshift distortion of eq.(21 ) can be estimated by ( yang et al 2002 ) @xmath179 where the dwt variables @xmath180 are given by @xmath181\\psi_{j , l}({x})d{x}$ ] .",
    "the redshift distortion factor @xmath182 depends on the dwt power spectrum of the velocity field @xmath174 on scale @xmath183 .",
    "because the average of @xmath16 in the structure function eq.(1 ) , or @xmath184 , is only over on modes @xmath121 , the redshift distortion factor @xmath182 does not involve in this average .",
    "thus , the function @xmath70 of @xmath180 will be different from the function @xmath70 of @xmath185 by a factor @xmath182 .",
    "thus , both @xmath186 and @xmath187 of @xmath188 do not contain the redshift distortion factor @xmath182 .",
    "thus , @xmath189 and @xmath187 of @xmath180 should also satisfy the @xmath2-hierarchy eq.(12 ) as that of field @xmath126 .",
    "that is , the @xmath2-hierarchy is not affected by the redshift distortion .",
    "figure 4 presents the @xmath2-hierarchy of observed transmitted flux @xmath161 .",
    "it is very well fitted by a straight line for data on the scale range from @xmath190 1 to 15 h@xmath128 mpc .",
    "it yields @xmath191 .",
    "figure 5 shows the @xmath2-hierarchy of observed transmitted flux , which is the same as fig.4 , and the noised simulation samples @xmath160 .",
    "we see that the both real and simulation samples are well coincident .",
    "the simulation samples yield @xmath192 .",
    "therefore , both real and simulation samples are well @xmath2-hierarchical , and the numbers of @xmath2 are well consistent .",
    "the data points of figure 4 are scattered along the straight line @xmath189-@xmath187 , while the points of figure 5 are clustered .",
    "this is due to all simulation samples have the same length , while for real samples consisting quasars with different redshift , we take only the sections of transmitted flux , which are in the redshift range @xmath193 - 2.6 .",
    "the statistics of eq.(14 ) is based on the ratio between high order moment @xmath194 and @xmath195 , both of which have the same order of @xmath63 . when @xmath78 , the ratio actually is kurtosis .",
    "the moment ratio of @xmath196 to @xmath197 , obviously , is independent of the redshift distortion factor @xmath182 .",
    "therefore , the ratio of @xmath196 to @xmath197 has to satisfy the same property as @xmath194 to @xmath195 .",
    "thus , for a given @xmath15 , the relation of @xmath198 and @xmath82 has to be a straight line with slope @xmath199/(1-\\beta)$ ] [ eq.(15 ) ] .",
    "since the parameter @xmath2 is already determined by the @xmath2-hierarchy , the test here is whether we can find one parameter @xmath43 to fit the slops of @xmath200 vs. @xmath82 for different @xmath15 .",
    "the result is presented in fig .",
    "6 . it shows the relation of @xmath201 vs. @xmath82 for real data with @xmath78 and 3 , i.e. the statistics are of the order of 4 and 6 .",
    "the slopes of the fitted straight lines are @xmath202 for @xmath78 , and @xmath203 for @xmath204 .",
    "thus , using @xmath205 , we have @xmath206 for @xmath78 and @xmath207 for @xmath204 . in spite",
    "that the statistical errors are still large , one can already see that different @xmath15-lines yield about the same parameter @xmath43 .",
    "in other words , the moment statistics passed the test of log - poisson hierarchy .",
    "the number of @xmath43 given by the real data of the transmitted flux is less than the number @xmath208 of @xmath126 field (  3.2 ) .",
    "therefore , the field of transmitted flux of real samples is less singular than the field @xmath126 .",
    "this is reasonable if considering the real data are noised .      in  4.2 and 4.3 .",
    ", we have found that the log - poisson parameters of the transmitted flux should be @xmath209 and @xmath207 .",
    "this result can be used to compare the log - poisson hierarchy and log - normal model .",
    "we now consider the moment ratio @xmath210 $ ] as a function of @xmath15 on a given scale @xmath18 .",
    "figure 7 presents the @xmath211 as a function of @xmath15 for real data on scales @xmath212 ( nabla ) , 3.07 ( triangle ) , 6.14 ( circle)and 12.3 ( square ) h@xmath128 mpc .",
    "@xmath15 is from 1 to 4 .",
    "the @xmath15-dependent curves shown in figure 7 are given by eqs.(14 ) and ( 15 ) , in which the fitted parameters are @xmath209 and @xmath213 the @xmath214 in eq.(14 ) is determined by @xmath215=0 $ ] when @xmath216 .",
    "although the observed data points of figure 7 actually are the same as figure 6 , we see that the observed data points show large scatter in figure 6 , but almost no scatter in figure 7 .",
    "this is because figure 6 gives moment ratio as a @xmath18 function , while figure 7 shows the @xmath15-dependence of the moment ratio . for a given @xmath18 ,",
    "the gaussian noise will yield a moment ratio given by eq.(13 ) , which is a smooth function of @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , a gaussian noisy sample should not cause scatter with respect to @xmath15 . on the other hand ,",
    "gaussian noise generally is not a smooth function of @xmath18 .",
    "it yields the scatter of fig .",
    "figure 7 shows that the @xmath15-dependence of moment ratio @xmath217 $ ] is significantly dependent on scale @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , it can not be fitted by a gaussian field , for which moment ratio is @xmath18-independent [ eq.(13 ) ] .",
    "the field of @xmath218 is non - gaussian .",
    "the smaller the scale @xmath18 , the stronger the non - gaussianity .",
    "the log - normal model of the transmitted flux of qso ly@xmath0 absorption spectrum is very successful to explain various low - order statistical features of ly@xmath0 forests ( bi 1993 ; bi & davidsen 1997 ) .",
    "the log - normal model also predicts that the transmitted flux is non - gaussian and intermittent . for the moment ratio , the log - normal model yields ( pando et al 2002 ) @xmath219\\ ] ] where @xmath220 is the power spectrum of the field . for each @xmath18",
    ", one can fit eq.(24 ) to observed points with @xmath220 .",
    "the results are plotted in figure 8 .",
    "it shows that , if we try to give a good fitting of eq.(24 ) with real data at orders @xmath221 , the @xmath15-curves of eq.(24 ) always give a large deviation from the real data at @xmath222 .",
    "this deviation can not be reduced with selecting @xmath220 .",
    "this is because the deviation is from the @xmath223-dependence of @xmath211 when @xmath15 is large .",
    "the @xmath223-dependence can not be reduced with the parameter @xmath220 .    on the other hand , at high @xmath15",
    ", the log - poisson model gives @xmath224 .",
    "the increasing with @xmath15 is then consistent with observation . in figs .",
    "7 and 8 we show the error bars for data points of @xmath212 h@xmath128 mpc . although the errors are large at high @xmath15 , the result is clearly consistent with @xmath15-dependence , and unfavor the @xmath223-dependence .",
    "therefore , the higher order statistics of the ly@xmath0 transmitted flux is effective to discriminate between the log - poisson and the log - normal model .",
    "the log - normal model yields too strong non - gaussianity .",
    "this point actually has already been mentioned in the study of turbulence ( e.g. frisch 1995 ) .",
    "the last statistical feature used to test the log - poisson hierarchy is the scale - scale correction .",
    "similar to the statistics of high order moment (  4.3 ) , the ratio of scale - scale correction , @xmath225 is independent of the redshift distortion factor @xmath182 . the field @xmath226 should show the scale - scale correlation as @xmath227 eqs.(17)-(19 ) .    before doing this test",
    ", we would emphasize that the scale - scale correlation is statistically independent of the statistics of high order moments .",
    "for instance , one can construct a field , which shows gaussian distribution in terms of its one point distribution of @xmath228 , but highly scale - scale correlated between variables @xmath228 with different @xmath119 ( pando et al 1998 , feng & fang 2000 ) .",
    "the clustering of cosmic large scale structure in the nonlinear regime essentially is due to the interaction between fourier modes on different scales .",
    "therefore , cosmic clustering will definitely leads to scale - scale correlation .",
    "scale - scale correlation is also very effective to distinguish various hierarchy cascade models ( pando et al .",
    "1998 ) .    figure 9 presents the @xmath78 scale - scale correlation of observed data , in which the ratio @xmath89 is fixed to be equal to 2 .",
    "the slop of the fitting straight line in fig .",
    "9 should be given by eq.(19 ) . since eq.(19 ) depends only on the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath43 , both of which have already been determined in  4.2 and 4.3 .",
    "there is no free parameters in the fitting of fig .",
    "if we doing a straight line , we found the parameters @xmath205 and @xmath229 .",
    "the value of @xmath2 is the same as that of  4.2 , while the value of @xmath43 is smaller than that of  4.3 , but the deviation is not larger than 1-@xmath230 .",
    "the scale - scale correlation is more sensitive to the quality of the data , as it is the correlation between modes on different scales .",
    "the result of figure 9 is basically consistent with the scale - scale correlation predicted by the log - poisson hierarchy .",
    "nonlinear evolution of mass and velocity fields is a central problem of large scale structure of the universe .",
    "the clustering of the cosmic baryon fluid , governed by the navier - stokes equation in gravitational field of an expanding universe , has to be self similarly hierarchical in the scale free range in which the dynamical equations and initial perturbations are scale - invariant .    the log - poisson hierarchical clustering sketches the nonlinear evolution of cosmic baryon fluid in the scale free range .",
    "if the initial density perturbations are gaussian , and their power spectrum is given by power law @xmath231 , the structure functions initially have to be @xmath232 . in the regime of linear evolution",
    ", the structure functions will keep to be @xmath233 , and the intermittent exponent is @xmath234 .",
    "according to the log - poisson hierarchy scenario , the nonlinear evolution leads to the hierarchical transfer of the power of clustering from large scales to small scales .",
    "the structure function will become @xmath235 , where the nonlinear term of the intermittent exponent is @xmath236 $ ] , in which the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath43 are dimensionless .",
    "@xmath2 measures the intermittency of the field , and @xmath43 measures the singularity of the clustering . for gaussian field , we have @xmath237 , and therefore , @xmath238 for all order @xmath15 . since the onset of nonlinear evolution , the parameter @xmath2 will gradually decrease , and the field becomes intermittent .    with simulation samples",
    ", we found that the parameter @xmath2 is decreasing with the decrease of redshift @xmath239 .",
    "it means that the field is weakly intermittent at earlier time , but strong intermittent at later time ( liu & fang 2008 ) .",
    "although @xmath240 , the nonlinear evolution keeps the cosmic baryon fluid to be scale - invariant .",
    "we showed that the mass density field of neutral hydrogen fluid in the scale free range is also well described by the log - poisson hierarchy in spite of the neutral hydrogen fraction of the baryon fluid is not constant in space .",
    "this is because the uv ionization photon is assumed to be uniform , and it does not violate the scale invariance of this system .",
    "however , the number of @xmath2 of neutral hydrogen is found to be less than that of total baryon fluid .",
    "therefore , the neutral hydrogen is less intermitted .    the ly@xmath0 transmitted flux of quasars ly@xmath0 absorption spectrum is considered to be effective to probe the mass and velocity fields of neutral hydrogen",
    ". however , the redshift distortion of the velocity field leads to the deviation of the field of the ly@xmath0 transmitted flux from the neutral hydrogen field .",
    "the transmitted flux does not satisfy all predictions of log - poisson hierarchy .",
    "fortunately , the effect of radshift distortion is approximately negligible for some log - poisson hierarchical predicted features .",
    "thus , we can test the log - poisson hierarchy with quasars ly@xmath0 absorption spectrum .    using high resolution and high s / n data of quasars ly@xmath0 absorption spectrum ,",
    "we show that all the non - gaussian features predicted by the log - poisson hierarchy , including the hierarchical relation , the intermittent exponent , the ratios of different moments , and the scale - scale correlation , are consistent with observed samples .",
    "the observed samples of the transmitted flux yield the same intermittence parameter @xmath2 as that of neutral hydrogen field produced with hydrodynamic simulation of the concordance @xmath1cdm universe .",
    "our result shows that the intermittent exponent @xmath21 , or parameters @xmath2 and @xmath43 , is effective to discriminate among models of nonlinear evolution .",
    "the log - normal model can well fit observed data on lower order statistics , but not good on higher orders . on the other hand , the log - poisson model gives good fitting on lower order as well as higher order statistics .",
    "therefore , a comparison between the log - poisson model and log - normal model on lower order statistics will be able to find the relation between parameters of the log - poisson and log - normal models .",
    "this relations would be useful to explain the parameters of log - poisson model with well - known parameters in cosmology , as the parameters of log - normal model generally are known in cosmology .",
    "recent studies have shown that the turbulence behavior of baryon gas can be detected by the doppler - broadened spectral lines ( sunyaev et al . 2003 ; lazarian & pogosyan 2006 ) .",
    "although these works focus on the turbulence of baryon gas in clusters , the result is still applicable , at least , for the warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) , which is shown to follow the evolution of burger s fluid on large scales ( he et al .",
    "2004 , 2005 ) .",
    "the last but not least , the polarization of cmb is dependent on the density of electrons , and therefore , the map of cmb polarization would provide a direct test on the non - gaussian features of ionized gas when the data on small scales become available ."
