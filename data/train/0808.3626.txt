    "there are several common features in theoretical approaches for studying qcd dynamics in hard nuclear reactions .",
    "these features are the following : ( a ) one can clearly identify a hard sub - process in the scattering mechanism ; ( b ) which can be factorized from the soft nuclear part of the reaction ; ( c ) the subprocess is hard enough for pqcd to be applicable ; ( d ) soft part of the reaction could be expressed through the measurable / extractable quantities such as partonic distribution functions , hadron - hadron scattering amplitudes , form - factors and calculable nuclear wave functions .",
    "if all the above requirements are achieved such theoretical approaches may yield ( sometimes ) parameter free predictions ( see e.g. @xcite ) and practically always will allow us to study the qcd aspects of strong interaction dynamics which otherwise can not be investigated without using nuclear targets .",
    "the several of such reactions which satisfy above criteria are , ( i ) semi - inclusive deep - inelastic nuclear reactions aimed at studies of nuclear modification of partonic distribution functions  ( pdfs ) ( emc effects ) ( see e.g. @xcite ) ; ( ii ) high momentum transfer elastic scattering off few - nucleon systems that can be used to study the onset of quark degrees of freedom in strongly correlated few nucleon systems@xcite , ( iii ) hard electroproduction reaction off nuclei in which the final state interaction is used to probe the dominance of point like configurations in the hadronic wave function at large @xmath4 ( color transparency / coherence phenomena ) @xcite ; ( iv ) dis nuclear scattering at @xmath5 as a framework for investigation of the mechanism of generation of super - fast quarks@xcite ( v ) as well as , hard break - up of two - nucleons in nuclei which can be used to probe the dynamics of strong interaction in two - nucleon system at intermediate to short distances@xcite .",
    "here we focus on the last class ( v ) of the reactions , in which high energy photon produces two energetic nucleons which equally share the initial energy of the photon .",
    "these reactions kinematically correspond to the break - up of 2n system at @xmath6 angle in the @xmath7 @xmath8 center of mass reference frame .    due to completely symmetric kinematic configuration the scattering process",
    "is dominated by photon probing the structure and the dynamics of the exchanged particle in the nn system ( fig.1 ) .",
    "high energy of photon in this case provides necessary resolution to probe the qcd content of nn interaction whether it proceeds through the @xmath9 exchange ( fig.1a ) , quark interchange ( fig.1b ) or gluon exchanges ( fig.1c ) .",
    "effectiveness of these processes in probing qcd aspects of nuclear interaction can be seen ( for @xmath10 reactions ) from the following kinematical considerations@xcite ) in which : @xmath11 simple estimate shows that already at @xmath12  gev the invariant momentum transfer @xmath13  gev@xmath14 and invariant mass of the @xmath15 system @xmath16  gev .",
    "these are conditions for which one expects an onset of quark degrees of freedom in the dynamics of strong interaction@xcite .",
    "one of the first theoretical predictions for high energy and large cm angle break - up reactions based on quark - gluon content of interacting hadrons was the quark - counting rules@xcite .",
    "according to these rules it was predicted in ref.@xcite that the differential cross section of @xmath10 reaction in high momentum transfer and large cm angle regime should behave like @xmath17 .",
    "this prediction was experimentally confirmed already starting at @xmath18  gev for several set of experiments at slac@xcite and jefferson lab@xcite .",
    "the quark counting predictions are based on the hypothesis that the fock states with minimal number of partonic constituents dominate in two - body large angle hard collisions@xcite .",
    "although successful in describing energy dependences of the number of hard processes , this hypothesis does not allow to make calculation of the absolute values of cross sections . especially for reactions involving baryons , calculations within perturbative qcd",
    "underestimate the measured cross sections by the orders of magnitude ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "this may be an indication that in the accessible range of energies the main part of the interaction is in the domain of nonperturbative qcd@xcite .",
    "however , the problem is that even if we fully realize the importance of nonperturbative interactions the theoretical methods of calculations in the nonperturbative domain are very restricted .",
    "the underlying assumption in hard rescattering model  ( hrm)@xcite is that high energy photodisintegration of two - nucleon system proceeds through the two stages in which an absorption of photon by a quark of one nucleon is followed by a high - momentum transfer ( hard ) rescattering with a quark from the second nucleon .",
    "the latter rescattering produces a final two nucleon state with large relative momenta .",
    "a typical diagram representing such a scenario is presented in fig.2 .        analyzing the type of diagrams as in fig.2 allows us to do the following observations :    * the dominant contribution comes from the soft vertices of @xmath19 transition , while quark interchange rescattering proceeds trough the hard gluon exchange , * the @xmath19 transition can be evaluated through the conventional deuteron wave functions , * the structure of hard quark interchange interaction in the rescattering part of the reaction is similar to that of hard nn scattering , * as a result the sum of the multitude of diagrams with incalculable nonperturbative parts of the interaction can be expressed through the experimentally measured amplitude of hard @xmath15 scattering .",
    "based on these observations , calculation of the @xmath20 amplitude yields@xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is high momentum transfer elastic @xmath2 scattering amplitude , @xmath23  ( @xmath24 ) represents the helicity wave function of nucleon and @xmath25 is the helicity of incoming photon .",
    "based on eq.([ampl ] ) one obtains the following expression for the differential cross section of @xmath20 reaction : @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the interesting properly of the function @xmath29 is that @xmath30 .",
    "therefore for @xmath6  cm scattering hrm prediction is parameter free . since @xmath2 cross section at high momentum transfer behaves like @xmath31 , the additional @xmath32 factor in eq.([crs_gdpn ] ) yields the same @xmath33 dependence for @xmath34 differential cross section as it follows from quark counting rule .",
    "however above derivation does not require an onset of pqcd regime . also , due to angular dependence of the @xmath2 amplitude",
    ", hrm predicts an angular distribution being not symmetric around @xmath6  cm .",
    "these predictions agree reasonably well with the experimental data@xcite(see e.g. fig.3 ) .",
    "cm scattering ( top ) and angular dependence of the cross section at @xmath35  gev ( bottom).,width=268,height=288 ]",
    "with all its success and accuracies yet to be improved hrm is only one of the approaches in describing hard photodisintegration reactions .",
    "other models such as reduced nuclear amplitude  ( rna ) formalism@xcite and quark - gluon string  ( qgs ) model@xcite describe many features of hard photodisintegration reaction , with qgs being rather successful in describing lower energy data .",
    "however rna and qgs require an absolute normalization .",
    "recently it was suggested@xcite that the break - up of pp pair from @xmath1 will further advance our understanding of the dynamics of hard photodisintegration of two - nucleon systems and allow further discrimination between above mentioned models  ( see also ref.@xcite ) .    within hrm the typical diagram describing two - proton break - up",
    "is shown in fig.4 .",
    ".,width=307,height=153 ]    hrm calculation similar to that of deuteron break - up reaction yields : @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 with @xmath40 being @xmath3 helicity amplitudes .",
    "since the cross section of hard @xmath3 scattering enters in eq.([pp ] ) one of the interesting predictions of hrm is the possibility of observation of energy oscillations at @xmath6 cm scattering similar to one observed in elastic @xmath3 scattering .",
    "another interesting feature of two - proton break - up reactions is the fact that at lower energies this reaction is three - step@xcite rather than two - step process .",
    "hrm in fact predicts that with an increase of photon energy due to the onset of quark - interchange ( rather than meson - exchange ) mechanism of nn interaction the two - body processes will dominate the cross section .",
    "the pioneering experiment of high energy @xmath3 break - up reaction@xcite was recently performed at jefferson lab which may shed new light on many issues of hard rescattering processes .",
    "in addition to the cross section measurements , polarization observables may provide a new insight into the dynamics of hard photodisintegration .",
    "original motivation for polarization measurements in high energy photodisintegration reaction was the expectation that the onset of the pqcd regime in the reaction dynamics will be accompanied by an observation of the helicity conservation in polarized reactions .",
    "both energy and angular distributions of several polarization observables have been measured at jlab@xcite .",
    "although the energy range covered was rather restricted , it provided an interesting insight into the structure of hrm .",
    "one of the unique features of hrm is that the struck quark carries the helicity of incoming photon . as a result one of the final nucleons",
    "will carry the bulk of the polarization of incident photon ( see e.g. eq.([ampl ] ) ) .",
    "thus in hrm photon plays as a helicity selector for the final nucleons .",
    "this yields a prediction for large asymmetry@xcite  ( @xmath41 ) for the longitudinal polarization of outgoing nucleons .",
    "in ref.@xcite we predicted a sizable asymmetry for @xmath41 even though the existing data@xcite ( with rather large errors ) at that time were indicating on vanishing values of @xmath41 .     for @xmath42",
    "gev.,width=326,height=288 ]    however , recent data@xcite , appears to confirm hrm prediction for large values of @xmath41 ( see fig.5 )",
    ". it will be interesting also to check the other hrm prediction that @xmath41 will continue to approach to unity with an increase of photon energy at @xmath6 cm scattering .",
    "it is very interesting that above described helicity selection mechanism of hrm predicts ( _ an opposite _ ) vanishing value of @xmath41 for two - body break up of proton pair from @xmath1 .",
    "this follows from the fact that the dominant part of the amplitude which represents two final state nucleons polarized in same direction are proportional to the nuclear ground state wave function with two initial nucleons having same helicities .",
    "due to pauli principle this part of the amplitude is strongly suppressed for the proton - pair in @xmath1 target .",
    "no such suppression exists for @xmath2 break up reactions .",
    "there is an accumulating evidence that hard rescattering mechanism explains the underlying dynamics of high energy and large cm angle break - up of a nucleon pair from @xmath0 and @xmath1 targets .",
    "one of the important features of hrm is that its prediction of unpolarized cross section at @xmath6 center of mass photodisintegration of deuteron is parameter free and no further adjustments are required .",
    "hrm predicts that energy dependence of two - proton break - up reaction should resemble that of hard elastic pp cross section , which could mean an observation of oscillation for @xmath43-weighted @xmath44 cross section similar to the one observed in hard elastic @xmath3 scattering .",
    "a new venue for advancing our understanding of the dynamics of hard break - up reactions could be an extension of these studies to the kinematics in which two excited baryonic states ( like @xmath45-isobars ) are produced at large center of mass angles of @xmath7  @xmath15 system",
