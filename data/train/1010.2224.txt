    "oe stars are a rare subset of the o - type stars that exhibit double - peaked or central emission in their balmer lines .",
    "this emission - line morphology is distinct from signatures of stellar winds , and is conventionally attributed to a circumstellar disk . although oe stars are usually considered to be a continuation of the be phenomenon toward hotter spectral types , it is difficult to understand how stable disks can coexist with the increasingly strong stellar winds typical of o - type stars .",
    "a plausible explanation is that the disk is maintained by a large - scale ( e.g. , dipolar ) magnetic field that channels outflowing wind material toward the magnetic equator , in which case the disk and the wind are really a single entity .",
    "a straightforward test of this hypothesis is to search for dipolar magnetic fields of sufficient strength to confine the wind . since hd155806 is the hottest galactic oe star currently known ( o7.5  v[n]e according to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* walborn 1973 ) ) , it should have the strongest wind ; and would therefore require the largest magnetic field to confine it .",
    "moreover , its comparatively narrow photospheric lines and brightness enhance the detectability of large - scale magnetic fields .",
    "the hypothesis of magnetic confinement was bolstered when ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hubrig et al .",
    "( 2007 ) ) reported the detection of a magnetic field with longitudinal strength of @xmath0 g , though ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hubrig et al . ( 2008 ) ) did not detect a significant field in subsequent observations .",
    "we used cfht / espadons to obtain high s / n spectropolarimetric observations of hd155806 on 2008 - 06 - 25 and 2008 - 07 - 19 .",
    "the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] show the mean absorption line profiles obtained with the least - squares deconvolution technique ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( donati et al . 1997 ) ) , while the upper panels show the distribution of circularly polarized light across the mean profiles .",
    "since deviations as large as the ones observed would occur ( 73% , 17% ) of the time for the observations in ( 2008 june , 2008 july ) , these data provide no evidence for the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "in addition , our reanalysis of the 5 vlt / fors1 grism observations discussed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hubrig et al . ( 2008 ) ) resulted in non - detections . *",
    "thus , we can not confirm the detection of a significant longitudinal field in hd155806 . *",

    "for hd155806 , a wind magnetic confinement parameter of @xmath1 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ud - doula & owocki 2002 ) ) implies that a dipolar field of _ at least _ 235",
    "g is required to confine the wind . since upper limits on the _ non - detection _ of a magnetic field in the espadons spectra are comparable , we conclude that the disk of hd155806 is not caused by magnetic confinement of its wind .",

    "* naz , et al .",
    "( 2010 ) ) did not detect the hard x - ray component in hd155806 that should be produced in such a hot star by the collision of channelled streams of wind emerging from opposite magnetic hemispheres .",
