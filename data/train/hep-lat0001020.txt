    "simulations of lattice qcd are increasingly dedicated to the goal of including the effects of sea quarks on many observables .",
    "one of the most distinctive signatures of sea quarks should be the elimination of the confining potential between widely separated valence quarks .",
    "quenched simulations have demonstrated that color - electric field lines connecting a static quark and antiquark are squeezed into a narrow tube or `` string '' @xcite .",
    "in full qcd however the flux - tube should be unstable against fission at large separations @xmath2 , where sea quarks should materialize from the vacuum and bind to the heavy quarks to form a pair of color - neutral bound states .",
    "it is perhaps surprising that some controversy persists in the literature as to whether `` string breaking '' has actually been observed in lattice simulations , and what techniques are required in order to convincingly demonstrate this phenomenon .",
    "this is despite extensive large scale simulations in unquenched qcd by several collaborations @xcite .",
    "this problem has come under renewed attack in the last few years with several new viewpoints emerging as to the underlying cause of the difficulty in observing string breaking , and suggestions as to the optimal approach for resolving this problem .",
    "these ideas have stimulated new work on string breaking in simulations of full qcd @xcite , and on a number of models that may shed light on string breaking .",
    "one suggestion to arise in the literature is that the wilson loop operator , which has typically been used to study the static potential between heavy quarks , has a very small overlap with the true ground state of the system at large @xmath2 , and hence is not suited to studies of string breaking @xcite .",
    "this has led to the consideration of other operators to study string breaking between static quarks , especially operators that explicitly generate light valence quarks at the positions of the heavy quarks @xcite .",
    "we note that another distinguishing feature of the operators proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite is that they generate correlation functions which receive disconnected contributions , where a pair of heavy - light bound states propagate independently of one another .",
    "another point of view was raised by one of us in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was suggested that string breaking can indeed be seen using wilson loops , but that it is essential to propagate the trial states over euclidean times @xmath3 of about 1  fm , the characteristic scale associated with hadronic binding . in contrast , typical studies of the static potential in unquenched qcd have been done on lattices with relatively `` fine '' spacings , limiting the propagation times to well under 1  fm , due to the high computational overhead .",
    "the use of coarse lattices enables much more efficient simulations of the static potential at the large scales relevant to string breaking .",
    "this was demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite where an improved action was used to observe string breaking on coarse lattices , using wilson loops in unquenched qcd in three dimensions , at dramatically reduced computational cost .",
    "in this paper we consider a number of the issues raised in the recent literature on string breaking , by doing simulations of quenched lattice qcd with valence `` quarks '' in the adjoint representation of the color group .",
    "there is a long history of lattice simulations of qcd with adjoint matter fields , which exhibits much of the physics of confinement of real qcd , and which also has a connection to supersymmetric physics @xcite . in particular",
    "an analogue of string breaking should occur in this model .",
    "for instance , the confining flux - tube between a pair of heavy adjoint quarks should be unstable against fission at large @xmath2 , where gluons can materialize from the sea to bind to the heavy quarks , forming a pair of color - neutral bound states dubbed `` gluelumps '' @xcite .",
    "hence the potential @xmath4 between a pair of static adjoint quarks in quenched qcd should approach a constant at large @xmath2 @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the energy of the lightest gluelump . once again , despite much effort @xcite , string breaking using wilson loops has not been seen in this model .",
    "however it has been suggested very recently that string breaking for adjoint quarks can be seen using correlators that explicitly generate valence gluons @xcite .",
    "here we undertake a detailed study of four dimensional su(2 ) gauge theory with static adjoint quarks ( this work was reported in unpublished form in ref .",
    "we use a tadpole - improved gluon action to do simulations on lattices with coarse spatial spacings @xmath0 .",
    "we use highly anisotropic lattices , with fine `` temporal '' spacings @xmath1 , in order to make a careful study of the time - dependent effective potentials .",
    "one lattice used here has @xmath7  fm and @xmath8  fm , which provides an increase in computational efficiency of some two orders of magnitude compared to simulations of adjoint quarks that were done in ref .",
    "@xcite using an unimproved action on lattices with spacings of about 0.1  fm .",
    "the lattice spacings are first determined from the potentials for quarks in the fundamental representation .",
    "we then study the wilson loop in the adjoint representation , and the masses of magnetic and electric gluelumps , which set the energy scale for string breaking according to eq .",
    "( [ vbreak ] ) .",
    "we consider correlators of gauge - fixed static quark propagators , without the string of spatial links that is found in the wilson loop ; this is similar to correlators proposed in refs . @xcite as alternatives to the wilson loop for observing string breaking .",
    "we also consider correlation functions for a pair of gluelumps , corresponding to states that explicitly contain valence gluons .",
    "we find that adjoint quark string breaking is extremely difficult to observe using wilson loops , because of a very strong suppression of the signal , due to approximate casimir scaling of the static potential . despite the considerable computational advantage provided by using coarse lattices , we are limited to propagation times well below 1  fm .",
    "it is clear from our results that plateaus in the effective mass plots can not be established at such short times .",
    "however it is also clear than a progressive `` flattening '' of the adjoint potential occurs as the propagation time is increased .",
    "by contrast saturation is readily observed in the effective potential naively constructed from the gluelump - pair correlator .",
    "similar results for some of the observables studied here were recently obtained on `` fine '' lattices using unimproved actions @xcite . the adjoint quark results in refs .",
    "@xcite were interpreted as providing support for the picture @xcite that wilson loops are not suitable for studies of string breaking , while suggesting that string breaking can readily be observed using operators that explicitly generate states containing light valence particles @xcite .",
    "however we suggest instead that one must be more careful in defining the goal of `` observing string breaking '' in euclidean time correlation functions .",
    "in particular we note that operators which explicitly generate light valence quarks , such as proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite , will _ automatically _ exhibit potentials that saturate , even in _ quenched _ qcd ( here considering the theory with fundamental representation quarks ) .",
    "this is especially clear when the correlator has disconnected contributions .",
    "this can also be seen from results presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , where correlation functions of exactly this form were studied in quenched qcd with fundamental representation quarks .",
    "if one goal of string breaking studies is to observe a distinctive feature of the effects of sea quarks , then clearly one must use an observable that distinguishes between the quenched and unquenched theories .",
    "we further argue that using an operator such as the wilson loop ( which might be thought of as creating `` initial '' states containing only heavy valence quarks ) is well motivated by making an analogy with the process of hadronization , which is the physical process that is most often alluded to in the context of `` string breaking . '' in hadronization the initial state consists of just two valence quarks at small separations , which then separate in real time , leading to the creation of light valence quarks at separations around 12  fm .",
    "the small overlap of the wilson loop with the broken string state at much larger separations may be an irreducible feature of using euclidean time correlators to mimic hadronization ; a nonlocal state of two widely separated heavy quarks connected by a string is bound to have a small overlap with the state consisting of two widely separated heavy - light mesons .",
    "on the other hand , we find that the overlap of the wilson loop with the broken string state is appreciable in a range of separations around the point at which string breaking actually occurs .",
    "simulations of wilson loops at very large separations , where the overlap becomes very small , are not relevant to hadronization , since in this physical process the original quarks never get to such points with the string intact .",
    "if one considers the static potential for quark separations around 12  fm , which are physically motivated by the analogy with hadronization , then `` string breaking '' does indeed appear to be accessible in full qcd using wilson loops .",
    "the important observation here is that propagation times of about 1  fm must be attained in order to resolve the broken string state @xcite .",
    "this can be more readily achieved by using improved actions to do simulations on coarse lattices ; we estimate that an increase in computational efficiency of some two orders of magnitude over most recent studies in full qcd can reasonably be achieved .",
    "this viewpoint is also supported by the results presented here , given the behavior of the time dependent effective masses , even though actual string breaking in adjoint wilson loops is not resolved . in this connection , we draw attention below to the somewhat surprising fact that string breaking in quenched qcd with adjoint quarks actually has a _ much _ higher computational burden than in unquenched qcd with real quarks . in our estimation",
    "all of the evidence supports the view that string breaking is accessible in large scale simulations of the wilson loop in full qcd .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "ii we present the details of the improved gluon action , and the construction of the various correlation functions to be studied .",
    "the results of the simulations are presented in sect .",
    "iii , where each correlator is considered in turn .",
    "finally , we present some further discussion and conclusions in sect .  iv .",
    "the tadpole - improved su(2 ) action on anisotropic lattices used here was previously studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , following earlier work in su(3 ) color @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is one half the trace of the @xmath11 wilson loop in the @xmath12  plane , @xmath13 is one half the trace of the @xmath14 rectangle in the @xmath12  plane , and where @xmath15 is the bare lattice anisotropy , @xmath16 this action has rectangles @xmath17 and @xmath18 that extend at most one lattice spacing in the time direction .",
    "this has the advantage of eliminating a negative residue high energy pole in the gluon propagator that would be present if @xmath19 rectangles were included .",
    "`` diagonal '' correlation functions computed from this action thus decrease monotonically with time , which is very important for our purposes .",

    "@xcite for observing string breaking will yield qualitatively the same behavior in both quenched and unquenched qcd .",
    "this raises the important question of exactly how one defines the goal of `` observing string breaking . ''",
    "perhaps one can advocate two points of view .",
    "from one point of view , one would say that correlation functions give spectral information only : the ground state energy versus quark separation . in this view",
    "such information is useful , for example , in characterizing the effects of quenching on meson - meson interaction energies @xcite , but not in relation to processes such as hadronization , which can only occur in the presence of dynamical fermions .",
    "then one might say that the difficulty in seeing `` string breaking '' with the wilson loop at very large separations indicates nothing more than that this operator has a poor overlap with the ground state in this regime .",
    "if spectral information is all that one is interested in , then one might not be too concerned that a particular operator shows qualitatively similar behaviour in the quenched and unquenched theories .    a second point of view , which we raised in sect .",
    "i , is that one can use certain correlation functions to make an analogy with hadronization .",
    "one might argue that this may be done by considering operators that do not generate light valence particles in the trial state .",
    "in particular , the operator should exhibit `` string breaking '' only in unquenched qcd ( here considering the theory with fundamental representation quarks ) .",
    "the wilson loop is such an operator , while operators which explicitly generate light valence particles are not . moreover , if a goal of string breaking studies is to observe a distinctive feature of the effects of sea quarks , then one should only consider observables that distinguish between the quenched and unquenched theories . in a sense",
    "the first point of view discussed above is concerned with `` static '' spectral information , that is qualitatively similar in the quenched and unquenched theories , while the second point of view makes contact with a `` dynamical '' process that is unique to the unquenched theory .    in making contact with hadronization one",
    "is interested in using the wilson loop to measure the potential for separations @xmath2 not much larger than the distance at which the string breaks , @xmath131  fm , since in the actual physical process the original quarks never get to larger separations with the string intact . in this region",
    "the overlap of the wilson loop with the ground state appears to be appreciable , judging from fig .",
    "[ fig : diagoverlaps ] , and from results presented in ref . @xcite .",
    "however one must still push the calculation to propagation times of about 1  fm , in order to properly resolve the broken string .",
    "this is where the difficulty actually lies in observing string breaking using wilson loops .    to date most simulations of full qcd",
    "have been done on lattices with relatively fine spacings , making it computationally very challenging to reach the length scales @xmath132  fm and propagation times @xmath133  fm relevant to string breaking .",
    "the use of coarse lattices with improved actions allows a much more efficient probe of this regime , as was recently demonstrated by one of us in ref .",
    "@xcite , where this approach was used to resolve string breaking with wilson loops in unquenched qcd in three dimensions .",
    "an increase in computational efficiency of some two orders of magnitude is possible using lattices with spacings between 0.3  fm and 0.4  fm , compared to most simulations that have been done so far in unquenched qcd .",
    "some work in this direction has recently been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "unfortunately calculations of the adjoint wilson loop in this string breaking regime did not prove to be feasible in this paper , with propagation times limited to well below 1  fm , even with coarse lattices . on the other hand",
    "it is clear that adjoint wilson loops exhibit a potential that progressively `` flattens '' at longer propagation times .",
    "moreover , the trend in the effective mass plots from the adjoint wilson loop at large @xmath2 is not inconsistent with the suggestion that string breaking would be observed at propagation times of about 1  fm .    in this context",
    "it is interesting to estimate the size of the adjoint wilson loop signal relative to the fundamental one , and to compare the computational cost of these simulations to those of unquenched qcd .",
    "if we assume roughly casimir scaling of the potential just below the string breaking distance , then the ratio @xmath134 of the adjoint to the fundamental wilson loops in su(3 ) color goes like @xmath135 \\approx 10^{-4 } , \\ ] ] using @xmath136  gev for the fundamental representation string tension , and @xmath132  fm and @xmath133  fm for the scales relevant to string breaking ( the ratio is yet smaller , by an order of magnitude , in su(2 ) color ) .",
    "this is to be compared with the roughly two orders of magnitude increase in the cost of simulating dynamical quarks compared to quenched simulations .",
    "( note that the gluelump - gluelump correlator @xcite does not show a comparable suppression of the signal , which is entirely a consequence of not removing the disconnected contributions from the correlator ) .",
    "hence , while the adjoint representation is interesting as a probe of confinement and supersymmetric physics , it is not a cost effective means of mimicking hadronization in full qcd .    on the other hand the results presented here do lend support to the general picture that wilson loops should in fact exhibit `` string breaking , '' as an analogy to hadronization .",
    "moreover string breaking should be accessible in real qcd with the computational power currently available in large scale simulation environments , especially if coarse lattices with improved actions are used .",
