    "have great influences on the subsequent formation and evolution history of stars and galaxies ; the star formation rate ( sfr ) in the metal - poor star - forming clouds is enhanced via the formation of h@xmath5 molecules on the surface of dust grain ( hirashita & ferrara 2002 ; cazaux & spaans 2004 ) .",
    "in addition , the cooling of gas by thermal radiation from dust themselves makes even the gas clouds with metallicity as low as @xmath8 @xmath9 fragment into low - mass gas clumps ( schneider et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ; omukai et al .",
    "thus , dust grains in the early universe may cause the characteristic mass scale of stars to shift from very high mass to low mass of @xmath10 @xmath7 observed at present time and strongly affect the evolution of the initial mass function ( imf ) at the early epoch of the universe .    also , dust grains in the early universe play crucial roles in revealing the structure and evolution of the universe from the relevant observations because they absorb stellar light and reemit it at infrared ( ir)submillimeter ( submm ) wavelengths .",
    "the thermal emission from dust at high redshifts can distort the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation ( loeb & haiman 1997 ) , and the obscuration and reddening of starlight by dust residing in the early interstellar and/or intergalactic space lead to the serious underestimate in evaluating the cosmic sfr from the observations directed toward the higher redshifts ( e.g. , hauser & dwek 2001 ) .    in fact , the recent observations have confirmed the presence of large amounts of dust grains at high redshifts of @xmath11 .",
    "the submm ( priddey et al . 2003 ; robson et al . 2004 ) and millimeter ( bertoldi et al . 2003 ) observations reported continuum thermal emission of dust grains from some quasars at @xmath12 , and have suggested a large amount of cold dust reaching up to @xmath13@xmath14 @xmath7 in the host galaxies of quasars .",
    "maiolino et al .",
    "( 2004a ) discovered the substantial extinction of stellar light by dust in the broad absorption line ( bal ) quasars at @xmath15 .",
    "they have shown that their extinction curves could be different from those of low - redshift quasars at @xmath16 , and have suggested that the difference may reflect different formation and evolution mechanisms of dust grains at @xmath11 .",
    "the main sources of dust grains in the early universe at @xmath12 are considered to be supernovae ( sne ) evolving from the massive stars because of their short lifetime .",
    "dust grains formed in the ejecta of sne are injected into the interstellar medium ( ism ) , and are subjected to destructive processes in the interstellar shocks induced by the ambient sne ( e.g. , jones et al . 1994 ; dwek , foster , & vancura 1996 ) .",
    "thus , the size distribution and amount of dust in the early interstellar space are determined by the balance between their production in sne and their destruction in shocks , and change with time according to the star formation activity ( e.g. , dwek 1998 ) .",
    "how much amount of dust grains are destructed in shocks as well as how much dust grains absorb stellar light and reemit it by thermal emission heavily depends on their chemical composition , size and amount .",
    "thus , it is essential to clarify the evolution of dust in the early universe by treating the formation and destruction processes of dust grains in a consistent manner , in order to elucidate the sfr and the imf during the early evolution of the universe from the future observations .",
    "nozawa et al . ( 2003 ) investigated the chemical composition , size distribution and amount of dust grains formed in the ejecta of pop iii sne . in this paper , as the second step to reveal the evolution of dust grains in the early universe , we explore dust destruction in the high - velocity interstellar shock driven by the sn explosion , adopting the dust model by nozawa et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for the initial dust residing in the early ism .",
    "we focus on dust destruction in nonradiative shock where dust grains are considered to be efficiently destructed by non - thermal and thermal sputtering ( e.g. , mckee 1989 ) because the nonradiative shock has a high shock velocity ( @xmath17 km s@xmath18 ) and a high gas temperature ( @xmath19 k ) .",
    "however , only a few set of experimental data on sputtering yield are available for the projectile - target combinations of astrophysical interest .",
    "hence , we first evaluate the sputtering yields for the combinations of dust species produced in pop iii sne and ion species of interest to us , collecting a large amount of sputtering data and applying the universal relation for sputtering yield proposed by bohdansky ( 1984 ) with a slight modification so as to reproduce well the experimental data .",
    "then , we investigate the dependence of the efficiency of dust destruction for each grain species not only on the gas density @xmath0 in the ism but also on the explosion energy @xmath2 and progenitor mass @xmath1 of sn driving the interstellar shocks by applying the hydrodynamical models of pop iii sne by umeda & nomoto ( 2002 ) . finally , we evaluate the time - scale of destruction for each grain species .    the efficiency of dust destruction by sputtering depends on the temperature and density of gas and the velocity of dust relative to gas in shock as well as the sputtering yield and the dust size .",

    "this paper is organized as follows : we first define the efficiency of dust destruction in   2 . in   3 , we describe the properties of the ism in the early universe together with the dust model adopted in the calculations , and in   4 , we present the basic equations of the hydrodynamic calculations for gas and the method of the simulation for dust destruction in shock",

    "the results of calculations of dust destruction are given in details for the model of interstellar shock that is driven by a sn with @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xmath22 and is propagating into the ism with @xmath23 @xmath24 , and the approximation formula for the time - scale of dust destruction as a function of @xmath2 and @xmath0 is derived in   7 , where the effects of the cooling of gas on the evolution of nonradiative shock and the destruction of dust are briefly discussed .",
    "the summary is presented in   8 .",
    "our main goal is to reveal the time - scale of dust destruction by interstellar shocks in the early universe . in general ,",

    "the truncation time @xmath37 being defined as the time at which @xmath30 drops down to 100 km s@xmath18 , the efficiency of destruction @xmath28 for each dust species is calculated by @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are , respectively , the mass of dust destructed and the mass of dust swept up by shock , and the mass of gas @xmath29 swept up by spherically symmetric shock is given by @xmath41 with the gas density @xmath42 in the ism and the travel distance of the shock front @xmath43 .",
    "we assume that the ism in the early universe is homogeneous and stationary ( @xmath44 ) , referring to the results of the simulations on the formation of the early h ii region by the first stars ( kitayama et al .",
    "2004 ) , which have shown that the radiative feedback from the massive stars causes the ambient ism to be homogenized with the mean gas density of @xmath45 1 @xmath24 . in the calculations , we consider the hydrogen number density in the ism to be in the range of 0.03 @xmath24 @xmath46 @xmath24 to reveal the dependence of the efficiency of dust destruction on the gas density in the ism .",
    "the ism surrounding the sn explosion is considered to be ionized by the radiation of the massive progenitor stars and heated to by @xmath47 k ( kitayama et al .",
    "2004 ; machida et al . 2005 ) , and then @xmath48 is expected to decrease below @xmath49 k where the recombination rate can be high even for the metallicity as low as @xmath50 @xmath4 ( wolfire et al .",
    "1995 ) . however , the evolution of gas temperature in postshock flow is almost independent of @xmath48 until the end of the sedov  taylor phase of high - velocity shock considered in this paper , and the temperature of gas @xmath51 at the shock front does not decrease below several of @xmath49 k at the truncation time , as is shown in the result of calculations ( see 7.1 ) .",
    "thus , we take @xmath52 k as the representative gas temperature in the ism , independently of the density of gas .    the truncation time as well as",
    "the time evolution of gas temperature and density structures in postshock flow is considered to be affected by the cooling of gas depending on the metallicity of the ism .",
    "especially , when @xmath53 k , the efficient line coolings of h and he ions cause the shock velocity to decelerate rapidly , and resultingly regulate the truncation time .",
    "however , the gas cooling function is almost independent of the metallicity for @xmath3 @xmath9 corresponding to [ fe / h ] @xmath54 since the metal lines do not contribute to the cooling of gas at @xmath55 k ( sutherland & dopita 1993 ) , and we adopt the gas cooling function for the zero metal case given in sutherland & dopita ( 1993 ) ( see 4.1 ) .",
    "note that the efficiency of dust destruction , which is defined by the mass ratio of dust destructed to dust swept up by shock , does not depend on the metallicity as long as @xmath3 @xmath9 , despite the fact that the amount of dust in the ism is proportional to the metallicity , and in the calculations we assume that the metallicity of the ism in the early universe is @xmath50 @xmath9 to investigate the destruction of dust in the ism .",
    "the elemental composition of gas in the ism is given in table 1 where the c , n , and o metals are included so as to adjust the metallicity to @xmath50 @xmath9 and their abundances are simply evaluated by multiplying the metallicity and the primordial ratios tabulated in sutherland & dopita ( 1993 ) ; note that these metals play no role in the physical processes relevant to dust destruction because of the much lower abundances than h and he .",

    "dust grains in the ism at the early epoch of the universe considered in this paper are expected to be predominantly produced in the ejecta of sne . to reveal what kind of dust grains form in the early universe , todini & ferrara ( 2001 ) calculated dust formation in primordial core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) , assuming the uniform elemental composition and gas density within the he core .",
    "they have shown that the newly formed grains are amorphous carbon with size around 300 @xmath58 , and al@xmath5o@xmath59 , mgsio@xmath59 , mg@xmath5sio@xmath60 and fe@xmath59o@xmath60 whose sizes are around 1020 @xmath58 . by extending the model of dust formation by todini & ferrara ( 2001 ) to pair - instability supernovae ( pisne )",

    "2000 ) .",
    "however , as discussed by kozasa , hasegawa , & nomoto ( 1989 ) , the species of dust formed in the ejecta largely depend on the elemental composition in the he core , and their sizes are affected by the time evolution of gas density and temperature .",
    "thus , nozawa et al . ( 2003 ) extensively investigated dust production in pop iii ccsne and pisne , by considering two extreme cases for the elemental composition in the ejecta ; the unmixed case with the original onion - like structure and the uniformly mixed case within the he core . in the calculations of dust formation",

    "these works strongly suggest that the comparisons with the observations relevant to dust in the early universe prefer dust grains produced in the unmixed pop iii ccsne rather than those in the mixed pop iii ccsne .",
    "therefore , as the representative model of the initial dust grains residing in the early ism , we adopt the size distribution and abundance of each grain species obtained by the calculations of dust formation in the unmixed ejecta of pop iii sn with @xmath65 @xmath22 by nozawa et al .",

    "it is useful for the following discussion to address here the behavior of size distribution of each dust species produced in the unmixed ejecta .",
    "c , fe and sio@xmath5 grains have a lognormal - like size distribution with the relatively large average radius of @xmath69 @xmath61 m , while the size distribution functions of fes , mg@xmath5sio@xmath60 and mgo grains are approximately power - law . the average radii of al@xmath5o@xmath59 and mgsio@xmath59 grains are very small ( @xmath70 @xmath61 m ) .",

    "this algorithm is one of the upwind schemes for the euler equations and is well suited to solve problems involving a shock .",
    "the calculations for the time evolution of shock and dust destruction are performed via the following two steps . in the first step",

    "note that dust destruction in this first step does not contributes to the evaluation of the destruction efficiency because the mass of gas swept up by shock is less than 0.1 % of that by @xmath98 .",
    "also , the cooling of gas by dust has no effects on the subsequent structure of shock . in the second step , fixing the spatial mesh number to 430 , we rearrange the density , temperature and velocity of postshock gas obtained from the first step into the inner 30 linear meshes .",
    "then , including dust , we calculate the time evolution of shock as well as dynamics and destruction of dust .    by treating dust as a test particle ,",
    "the physical processes relevant to dust are calculated as follows .",
    "consider a stationary ( @xmath99 ) dust grain characterized by its composition and number density with radius between @xmath100 and @xmath101 at a given position @xmath102 in the ism .",
    "once the grain enters into the shock front , the relative velocity to gas @xmath103 is assigned .",

    "note that the dust grain is considered to be completely destroyed if the grain radius is smaller than the nominal monomer radius of condensate given in nozawa et al .",
    "sputtering is divided into two categories reflecting the difference in the underlying mechanisms ; physical sputtering and chemical sputtering .",
    "physical sputtering invokes a transfer of kinetic energy from the incident particle to target atoms and subsequent ejection of those atoms which have acquired kinetic energy enough to overcome the binding forces exerted by the target .",
    "chemical sputtering invokes a chemical reaction induced by the impinging particles which produces an unstable compound at the target surface ( sigmund 1981 ) . in the high - velocity shocks considered in this paper , dust grains are predominantly destroyed by physical sputtering because dust temperature is at most 100 k in the postshock region ( dwek 1987 ) ; chemical sputtering is of no importance since this process is realized at the temperature as high as 800 k ( roth 1983 ) .",
    "thus , in what follows , we simply refer to physical sputtering as `` sputtering '' .",
    "the efficiency of destruction by sputtering is characterized by the sputtering yield defined as the mean number of emitted atoms per incident particle .",
    "the sputtering yield depends on the impact energy of a projectile and the incident angle to the target surface as well as on the projectile - target combination . however , only a few set of experimental data on sputtering yield are available for the combinations of dust materials and ion species of interest to us .",
    "one method evaluating the sputtering yields for the projectile - target combinations of astrophysical interest is to apply the monte - carlo code for the _ transport of ions in matter _",
    "( trim , ziegler , biersack , & littmark 1985 ) that simulates the energy loss of a projectile ion with given impact energy and incident angle in a solid ( field et al .",
    "1997 ; may et al .",

    "the trim code requires as input parameters not only the surface binding energy of the target , but also the displacement energy @xmath115 and the lattice binding energy @xmath116 .",
    "particularly , uncertainties in the value of @xmath115 are a significant source of error in the calculated sputtering yield ( may et al .",
    "2000 ; bianchi & ferrara 2005 ) .",
    "in fact , the sputtering yields computed by this simulation code have been known to significantly differ from the experimental data at low impact energies ( bianchi & ferrara 2005 ) .",
    "furthermore , it is time - consuming to combine the monte - carlo simulation with the hydrodynamical calculation for dust destruction .",
    "another one is to apply the universal relation which is the analytic formula derived by bohdansky ( 1984 ) for the energy dependence of sputtering yield at normal incidence for a monatomic solid . to investigate the destruction of interstellar dust such as c , fe , sic , sio@xmath5 and h@xmath5o ice , tielens et al .",
    "( 1994 ) have applied the universal relation by treating a constant @xmath117 in this formula as a parameter , and determined it by comparing the available experimental data with the sputtering yield calculated by the universal relation .",
    "they have shown that the universal relation can be applied to not only monatomic solids but also compound solids by taking the appropriate average values for the atomic and mass numbers and the surface binding energy under the assumption that each of element consisting of the target is sputtered off with the same rate . however , the agreement of the calculated sputtering yield with the experimental data is not so much good for the ion - target combinations with the mass ratio of target atom to incident ion ranging from 0.7 and 2 .",

    "the collisional interactions between dust and a hot gas in shock efficiently transfers charge , momentum and energy between the two phases . as a result",
    ", dust grains acquire the electric charge , undergo the resistance to their motion through the gas , are eroded by sputtering , and are heated by collisions with gas . also , heated dust grains cool the gas through their thermal emission .    electric charge on a grain plays an important role in grain physics in hot plasmas through the coulomb interaction and the lorentz force in the presence of magnetic field . here , we concentrate on the destruction of dust grains in fast ( @xmath163 km s@xmath18 ) and hot ( @xmath164 k ) nonradiative shocks . for @xmath165",
    "k , the effect of the electric charge of dust grain can be neglected because the dimensionless potential parameter @xmath166 defined by the ratio of the electric potential acquired by dust to the kinetic energy of gas is approximated by @xmath167 and is significantly smaller than unity ( draine & salpeter 1979 ; mckee et al .",
    "also , the erosion rate of refractory grains by thermal sputtering quickly decreases for @xmath168 k ( draine & salpeter 1979 ) .",
    "correspondingly , the erosion rate of dust grans by non - thermal sputtering decreases quickly for the relative velocity of dust to gas @xmath169 km s@xmath18 .",
    "therefore , it can be expected that the electric charge does not significantly affect the destruction of dust grains in nonradiative shocks considered in this paper .",
    "also , it is assumed that the early ism is not pervaded by a magnetic field because the magnetic field in the early universe is considered to be very weak ( gnedine , ferrara , & zweibel 2000 ) .",
    "thus , we formulate the basic equations describing the motion of dust grains and their erosion by sputtering in postshock flow , neglecting the effect of charge on dust grain .      once dust grains being at rest in the preshock ism encounter the interstellar shock , they move ballistically behind the shock front with the initial velocity relative to gas @xmath170 where @xmath30 is the shock velocity , and are eroded by non - thermal sputtering . a grain streaming through the ionized gas is decelerated by a drag force due to the direct collisions with gas particles , and thus the velocity of dust relative to gas decreases .",
    "the drag force acting on a grain results from the momentum transfer from gas to dust . under the assumption",
    "that a gas particle reflects specularly from grain surface and that the kinetic temperature of gas is the same for all gas species , the deceleration rate of a spherical grain of radius @xmath100 with the velocity relative to gas @xmath171 is given by ( e.g. , draine & salpeter 1979 ) @xmath172 where @xmath57 is the number density of hydrogen atom , @xmath173 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath104 is the gas temperature , @xmath174 is the bulk density of grain and @xmath175 with the mass @xmath176 of gas species @xmath119 .",

    "it can be seen from equation ( 19 ) , grains with smaller size and/or higher relative velocity can be effectively decelerated by drag force and come to comove with gas in shock .",
    "the destruction of dust grains in high - velocity and high - temperature nonradiative shock is dominated by sputtering .",
    "actually , we can neglect the thermal evaporation of dust , because the temperature of dust can not be raised as high as their sublimation temperature ( @xmath181 10002000 k ) for the preshock gas density considered in this paper ( e.g. , dwek 1987 ) .",
    "furthermore , we neglect the shattering process and partial vaporization caused by grain - grain collisions , since the number density of dust particles is very small in postshock flow and collisions between dust grains are extremely rare without a magnetic field .",
    "the erosion rate of grain by sputtering is calculated by taking the angle - averaged sputtering yield @xmath182 ( draine & salpeter 1979 ) and is given by ( e.g. , dwek et al .",

    "as shown in figure 3 , the gas density increases to 4 times that in the ism and the gas temperature steeply raises up at the shock front which is indicated by the arrow for a given time step . with the initial shock velocity @xmath214 6000 km s@xmath18 , the gas temperature at the shock front remains above 10@xmath215 k until @xmath216 years , and both @xmath30 and @xmath51 decrease with time . at @xmath217 years after the explosion",

    "@xmath30 decelerates below 100 km s@xmath18 at @xmath219 years when the shock front travels the distance of @xmath220 pc and @xmath51 drops down to several 10@xmath87 k. after then , a dense thin - shell forms at the shock front because of the effective line cooling , and the snr enters into radiative phase .",
    "the motion of dust grains ( upper panel ) and the evolution of their sizes ( lower panel ) in postshock flow as a function of time are depicted in figure 5 , as an example for c grains with the initial size of 0.01 @xmath61 m ( dashed ) , 0.1 @xmath61 m ( dotted ) , and 1 @xmath61 m ( solid ) .",
    "the thick solid curve in the upper panel indicates the position of the shock front .",
    "as dust grains initially at rest in the ism intrude into the blast wave , they depict the different trajectories depending on their initial sizes , which clearly demonstrates that the dust grains are segregated and subjected to the different sputtering processes in the postshock flow ; small grains with initial radius of 0.01 @xmath61 m are quickly decelerated by drag force , are trapped into gas near the shock front , and are completely destroyed by thermal sputtering .",
    "the 0.1 @xmath61m - sized grains are gradually decelerated to comove with gas in @xmath221 years after entering into the shock .",
    "large - sized grains with radius of 1 @xmath61 m are not so much suffered from deceleration by drag force and continue to keep the high velocity relative to gas . as a result",
    ", they are subjected to non - thermal sputtering , but their sizes are reduced very little , partly because they stay in the inner region of postshock flow where the gas density is lower than that near the shock front ( see fig .",
    "the modification of size distribution of each dust species due to destruction by sputtering is illustrated in figure 6 ; figure 6a for the initial size distribution before destruction and figure 6b for the size distribution after destruction .",
    "since the erosion rate by sputtering does not strongly depend on grain size ( see 6.2 ) , small grains are predominantly destroyed regardless of grain species ; the number of small - sized grain such as al@xmath5o@xmath59 is greatly reduced .",
    "c , sio@xmath5 and fe grains whose initial size distributions are lognormal with the relatively large average size are eroded but not completely destructed , and increase the numbers of smaller ones .",
    "grains with the size larger than 0.1 @xmath61 m are little affected by erosion .",
    "note that the size distribution summed up over all grains species gets flatter for the smaller radius with time compared with the corresponding initial size distribution approximated by a power - law formula with index of @xmath72 , while that for the larger radius remains almost unchanged .",
    "the destruction efficiency @xmath28 of each grain species is given in table 5 ( see unmixed grain model ) along with the initial average radius .",
    "it is expected that the efficiency of dust destruction are higher for grain species with the smaller average size because the smaller grains are predominantly destructed by sputtering .",
    "in fact , the efficiency of destruction of al@xmath5o@xmath59 grain with the smallest average radius is 0.667 and is the highest among dust species considered here .",
    "si and fe grains with initial average radii larger than 0.1 @xmath61 m have the destruction efficiencies less than 0.2 ; 0.13 for si grain and 0.15 for fe grain .",
    "however , the destruction efficiency of c grain with the smaller average radius is smaller than that of sio@xmath5 grain because of the lowest erosion rate among all grain species at @xmath222 k ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . also , fes grain has higher destruction efficiency ( 0.578 ) than those of mg@xmath5sio@xmath60 ( 0.451 ) and mgo grains ( 0.505 ) despite of the larger initial average radius , which reflects not only the higher erosion rate at @xmath223 k but also the mass distribution much more weighted toward the smaller grains .",
    "likewise , the destruction efficiency of mgsio@xmath59 grain with average size comparable to that of mg@xmath5sio@xmath60 and mgo is high ( 0.637 ) because of the lack of large grains .",
    "these facts indicate that the efficiency of dust destruction depends on the initial size distribution of dust grains as well as on the sputtering yield .    in order to clarify the effect of the initial size distribution on the efficiency of dust destruction , we present the results of dust destruction for the mixed grain model calculated with the same sn model and value of @xmath0 as those for the unmixed grain model .",
    "figure 7 shows the size distribution of each grain species ( al@xmath5o@xmath59 , mgsio@xmath59 , mg@xmath5sio@xmath60 , sio@xmath5 and fe@xmath59o@xmath60 ) before destruction ( fig .",
    "7a ) and after destruction ( fig .",
    "7b ) , and the destruction efficiencies of these grains are tabulated in table 5 ( see mixed grain model ) . as is the same as the unmixed grain model ,",
    "the numbers of al@xmath5o@xmath59 and fe@xmath59o@xmath60 grains with the small average size ( @xmath224 a few tens  ) are considerably reduced , which results in high efficiencies of destruction ( @xmath225 ) . for mgsio@xmath59 , mg@xmath5sio@xmath60 and sio@xmath5 grains with lognormal size distributions",
    ", the erosion of large grains leads to the increase of the number of smaller ones , and their destruction efficiencies span the range of @xmath226 .",
    "note that although the average size is twice larger than that in the unmixed case , the destruction efficiency ( 0.59 ) of mg@xmath5sio@xmath60 grain in the mixed case is significantly larger than that ( 0.45 ) in the unmixed case .",
    "the reason is that mg@xmath5sio@xmath60 grains formed in the unmixed ejecta have power - law - like size distribution and include the large - sized grains of @xmath227 @xmath61 m almost undestructed in shock ; the average size is not always suitable for assessing the feasibility of dust destruction .",
    "thus , we conclude that the dust destruction efficiency is very sensitive to the initial size distribution .",
    "the mass fraction of dust destructed reaches up to 34 % for the unmixed grain model and 50 % for the mixed grain model .      in this subsection",

    "also , the overall efficiency of dust destruction , which is defined as the ratio of the total mass of dust destructed to the total mass of dust swept up by shock , is plotted in figure 8a .",
    "the sn models used for the calculations are distinguished by open circles ( ccsne ) , open squares ( hne ) and filled triangles ( pisne ) .",
    "the destruction efficiencies for each grain species are almost the same for ccsne and a pisn with the explosion energy of @xmath229 irrespective of the progenitor mass @xmath1 , and increase with increasing @xmath33 .",
    "note that high explosion energy with @xmath230 causes the temperature of gas in postshock flow to raise up as high as @xmath14 k , but this does not directly influence on the efficiency of dust destruction because the increase of gas temperature does not always lead to the enhancement of the erosion rate by sputtering ( see fig .",
    "the reason for the increased efficiency with increasing @xmath33 is considered as follows .",
    "the high - velocity shock ( the initial shock velocity @xmath231 km s@xmath18 ) generated by the energetic sn explosion induces high velocity of dust relative to gas . then",
    ", dust grains are efficiently decelerated by drag force ( see equation ( 19 ) ) , are trapped in the high - density region near the shock front , and are significantly eroded by thermal sputtering .",
    "furthermore , since the high shock velocity takes much longer time to drop down to 100 km s@xmath18 ( see fig .",
    "9 ) , dust grains are immersed in a hot plasma for a long time , which causes even larger grains to be more eroded .",
    "it should be pointed out here that the efficiencies of destruction for the models of p170 with @xmath232 and p200 with @xmath233 are a little higher than that for h30 with @xmath234 .",
    "the reason is considered that the ejecta mass of pisne is more than 6 times larger than that of hne , and the resulting longer duration of the free expansion phase causes the longer truncation time than hne ( fig . 9 ) . on the other hand , the efficiency of destruction for p150 with @xmath235 @xmath22 and @xmath236 is almost the same as that for ccsne with @xmath236 because the initial shock velocity ( @xmath181 3000 km s@xmath18 ) much lower than that of ccsne makes the truncation time comparable to ccsne . therefore , although the destruction efficiency @xmath28 is almost independent of @xmath1 as long as @xmath229 , @xmath28 for pisne higher than that for hne at @xmath230 reflects the difference in the explosion mechanism depending on the progenitor mass .    to examine the dependence of @xmath28 on @xmath33 for each type of sn",
    ", we calculate the coefficients @xmath237 and @xmath238 in equation ( a1 ) given in appendix for sne ii ( c13 , c20 , c25 , c30 , h25 and h30 ) and pisne ( p150 , p170 and p200 ) separately , and the calculated overall efficiencies of dust destruction are indicated by dotted ( sne ii ) and dashed lines ( pisne ) in figure 8a . although the difference in the efficiency of dust destruction between sne ii and pisne increases with increasing @xmath33 , the deviations from the values calculated by @xmath237 and @xmath238 for all sn models are at most about 10 % at @xmath239 .",

    "the mass of gas swept up by shock @xmath29 and the truncation time @xmath37 calculated for @xmath228 @xmath24 are presented in figure 9 as a function of sn explosion energy . as is the same as @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath37",
    "are almost the same for @xmath229 regardless of @xmath1 , and increase with increasing @xmath33 .",
    "next , we show the dependences of @xmath28 and @xmath29 on the preshock gas density @xmath35 .",
    "figure 10a plots the overall efficiency of dust destruction versus @xmath35 for c20 ( crosses ) , h25 ( open circles ) and h30 models ( filled triangles ) with @xmath241 and 30 , respectively . the efficiency of dust destruction increases with increasing @xmath242 , since higher gas density causes more frequently collisions between dust and gas to erode efficiently the surface of dust grains by sputtering ; for example , the mass fraction of dust destroyed for h30 model is 78 % for @xmath243 @xmath24 , but only 23 % for @xmath244 @xmath24 . in figure 10b , we present the mass of gas swept up by shock @xmath29 as a function of @xmath245 for c20 , h25 and h30 models .",
    "note that @xmath29 decreases with increasing @xmath35 , because shock wave more quickly decelerates and travels only small distance .",
    "the approximation formulae presented in appendix being combined , the time - scale of destruction for each dust species by the interstellar shock in the early universe is presented by @xmath246 for all sn models , where the dependences of @xmath28 on @xmath33 and @xmath245 are given by equations ( a1 ) and ( a3 ) , respectively .",
    "we derived the time - scale of dust destruction as a function of not only the explosion energy of sn but also the gas density in the ism .",
    "the swept - up gas mass is proportional not to @xmath33 but to @xmath247 , being different from the formula proposed by mckee ( 1989 ) .",
    "the time - scale of dust destruction derived here could be applicable to investigate the time evolution of dust grains in the early universe .",
    "especially , the difference of the efficiency of dust destruction for each grain species may have great influences on the amount and size distribution of dust grains residing in the early interstellar space .",
    "figure 11 shows the cumulative energy lost by the atomic process ( dashed ) , the inverse compton scattering ( dotted ) and the thermal emission from dust ( solid ) calculated for the sn model of c20 and for the ism with parameters of @xmath248 and @xmath50 @xmath4 at the redshift of @xmath88 . the total energy lost by these cooling processes",
    "is drawn by the thick solid curve .",
    "the inverse compton cooling is comparable to that by the atomic process in the early phase of the snr ( @xmath249 years ) .",
    "as the gas temperature decreases , the atomic process by h and he line coolings becomes dominant .",
    "compared with the above two cooling processes , the thermal emission from dust is extremely low and contributes only less than 0.1 % to the total energy loss . the transition of nonradiative shock to radiative shock occurs when the cumulative energy loss reaches to 0.01 % of the explosion energy .",
    "thus , only the h and he line coolings affect the time evolution of nonradiative shock and the dust destruction efficiencies in the ism with metallicity less than @xmath50 @xmath4 corresponding to the dust - to - gas mass ratio of @xmath250 in this paper .    however , it is expected that the effects of cooling of gas by dust come to be important for the ism with higher dust - to - gas mass ratio .",
    "the result of the calculation for dust destruction in the ism with @xmath50 @xmath4 and the dust - to - gas mass ratio @xmath251 shows that the truncation time and the overall efficiency of dust destruction decrease by 4.4 % and 2.6 % , respectively , compared with the results for dust - to - gas mass ratio of @xmath250 , though the gas temperature in postshock gas decreases by about 20% .",
    "even if the dust - to - gas mass ratio is raised up to by four orders of magnitude , the cooling of gas by dust in nonradiative shock does not have the significant effects on the efficiency of dust destruction as well as the evolution of nonradiative shock .",
    "furthermore , the inverse compton cooling has influences on the evolution of nonradiative shock in the early universe . because the cooling rate by the inverse compton scattering is proportional to @xmath252 and that by atomic process is proportional to @xmath253 , the contribution of the inverse compton cooling is enhanced in postshock flow with the lower gas density and/or the higher gas temperature at the higher redshift . at the redshift of @xmath254 , for the sn model c20 with the preshock gas density of @xmath23 @xmath24 ,",
    "the truncation time is only 2 % shorter than that calculated at @xmath255 .",
    "thus , in this case , the inverse compton cooling seems not to affect the destruction efficiency of dust grains . however , more systematic studies covering wide ranges of the sn explosion energy and the gas density in the ism are necessary to reveal the effect of the inverse compton cooling .",
    "note that the cooling function of gas for @xmath256 @xmath257 is almost the same as that for the zero metal case ( sutherland & dopita 1993 ) .",
    "thus , the parameters of the ism considered in this paper ( @xmath50 @xmath4 and @xmath88 ) is competent for investigating dust destruction in the early universe , and the time - scale of dust destruction derived in 7.2 is applicable over the wide ranges of metallicity of gas in the ism ( @xmath3 @xmath4 ) and redshift ( @xmath258 ) .",
    "we investigate the destruction of dust grains in the interstellar shocks driven by sne as the second step to reveal the evolution of dust in the early universe , based on the dust models obtained by nozawa et al .",
    "we focus on dust destruction in nonradiative shock where dust grains are predominantly destroyed by non - thermal and thermal sputtering because of high temperature and high velocity of gas . the sputtering yields for the combinations of dust and ion species of interest to us",
    "are evaluated by applying the universal relation for sputtering yield with a slight modification and by determining the value of @xmath117 by fitting to the available experimental data and/or the results of the eddy simulations .",
    "the modified universal relation derived here can present the better fits to the available experimental data than the previous one .    in the calculations of dust destruction ,",
    "we solve the time evolution of gas temperature and density in spherically symmetric shocks , adopting the hydrodynamical models by umeda & nomoto ( 2002 ) as the initial condition for interstellar shock and including the cooling of gas by the atomic process , the inverse compton scattering and the thermal emission of dust .",
    "the erosion of dust by thermal and non - thermal sputtering caused by motion of dust relative to gas is carefully treated by taking into account the size distribution of each dust species .",
    "the results of calculations are summarized as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) because the sputtering predominantly destroys the small grain , the number of small - sized grain such as al@xmath5o@xmath59 and mgsio@xmath59 is greatly reduced .",
    "the erosion of c , sio@xmath5 and fe grains whose size distributions are lognormal - like with the average size larger than @xmath259 @xmath61 m increases the numbers of smaller ones .",
    "the size distribution summed up over all grains species becomes flatter for the small radius compared with the initial size distribution , while that for the radius larger than 0.2 @xmath61 m remains almost unchanged .",
    "\\(2 ) the efficiency of dust destruction is higher for the grains with the small average size such as al@xmath5o@xmath59 and mgsio@xmath59 and with the power - law - like size distribution such as fes , mg@xmath5sio@xmath60 and mgo . on the other hand ,",
    "si , fe , c and sio@xmath5 grains , which have the lognormal - like size distribution and the relatively large average radius , have lower efficiency of destruction .",
    "the detailed analysis of the behavior of dust destruction efficiency for each grain species indicates that not only sputtering yields but also the initial size distribution plays a crutial role in the efficiency of dust destruction by sputtering .",
    "\\(3 ) the efficiency of destruction @xmath28 for each dust species increases with increasing the explosion energy @xmath33 and/or with increasing the preshock gas density @xmath245 , but is almost independent of the progenitor mass @xmath1 of sn as long as @xmath33 is the same .",
    "the destruction efficiency @xmath28 as a function of @xmath33 is well reproduced by a power - law formula given by equation ( a1 ) .",
    "the dependence of @xmath28 on @xmath245 is well expressed by the quadratic equation ( a3 ) in terms of @xmath260 .",
    "\\(4 ) as is the same as @xmath28 , the mass of gas swept up by shock wave @xmath29 is the increasing function of @xmath33 and is approximated by a power - law formula given by equation ( a2 ) .",
    "however , @xmath29 decreases with increasing the gas density in the ism , and its dependence is also reproduced by a power - law formula whose index is given by equation ( a4 ) as a function of @xmath33 .",
    "finally , by combining these results , we present the analytic formula for the time - scale of destruction for each grain species in the early universe as a function of @xmath33 and @xmath245 .",
    "the derived time - scale of dust destruction can be employed to investigate the time evolution of the amount of dust grains in the early universe .",
    "\\(5 ) in the early universe , only the h and he line coolings affect the time evolution of nonradiative shock and the efficiencies of dust destruction .",
    "the thermal emission from dust grains is not so much important even for the ism with the dust - to - gas mass ratio of @xmath261 as long as the metallicity in the ism is @xmath3 @xmath4 .",
    "also , it is expected that the inverse compton cooling does not have the great effects on the evolution of shock at high redshifts .",
    "thus , the time - scale of dust destruction derived in this paper is applicable for ranges of metallicity of gas in the ism of @xmath3 @xmath4 and redshift of @xmath262 .    in this study , we focused on dust destruction in nonradiative shock where dust grains in the ism are considered to be predominantly destroyed .",
    "we should be mentioned here that a part of dust grains formed in the ejecta of sne are expected to be destroyed by reverse shock penetrating into the ejecta . because sputtering is the most dominant destruction process of dust grains in reverse shock as well , the simulation code of dust destruction constructed in this paper",
    "can be applied to explore the destruction of dust grains by reverse shocks .",
    "this work is now in progress .",
    "furthermore , in radiative shock with the shock velocities below 100 km s@xmath18 , shattering and partial vaporization by grain - grain collisions become important in the presence of a magnetic field . a magnetic field frozen into the gas",
    "causes charged grains to gyrate and accelerate behind the shock front and results in the enhancement of not only the sputtering rate but also grain - grain collision frequency .",
    "the shattering by grain - grain collision mainly leads to the redistribution of grain size ( tielens et al . 1994 ; jones , tielens , & hollenbach 1996 ) . the sophisticated study on this subject",
    "is left for the future work .",
    "the authors are grateful to the anonymous referee for critical comments which have improved the manuscript .",
    "the authors thank dr . h. umeda and prof .",
    "k. nomoto for making the ejecta model of pop iii supernovae available .",
    "this work has been supported in part by a grant - in - aid for scientific research from the japan society for the promotion of sciences ( 13640229 ) .",
    "in this appendix , we present the approximate formulae for the efficiency of dust destruction @xmath28 and the mass of gas swept up by shock @xmath29 as function of the sn explosion energy @xmath33 and the gas density @xmath263 in the ism . the energy dependence of the destruction efficiency for each grain species can be well reproduced by a power - law formula given by @xmath264 the solid lines in figure 8 indicate the least - squares fittings by this power - law formula for all sne whose numerical coefficients @xmath237 and @xmath238 are tabulated in table 6 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath29 on @xmath33 is well fitted by a power - law formula @xmath265 using the coefficients @xmath266 and @xmath267 given in table 6 , and is depicted in figure 9 for all sne ( solid ) , sne ii ( dotted ) , and pisne ( dashed ) .",
    "the destruction efficiency @xmath28 for each grains species @xmath26 as well as the overall destruction efficiency as a function of @xmath268 is expressed by @xmath269 and the coefficients @xmath270 , @xmath271 and @xmath272 derived by the least squares fittings are given in table 7 for the models c20 , h25 and h30 , respectively , along with the coefficients for overall destruction efficiency .",
    "the solid curves in figure 10a depict the overall destruction efficiencies calculated by equation ( a3 ) for the models c20 , h25 and h30 .",
    "this formula reproduces the destruction efficiencies calculated by the simulations with the accuracy less than 10 % for @xmath273 @xmath24 .",
    "the calculated @xmath29 can be reproduced by a power - law formula @xmath274 where the index @xmath275 is weakly dependent on @xmath33 and is approximated by @xmath276 this formula gives good agreements with the results of simulations , as represented by the solid lines in figure 10b .",
