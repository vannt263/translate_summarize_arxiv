    "since the pioneering work @xcite a number of further research papers have been devoted to the understanding of waves arising in 1d fpu - lattices , of which the only nontrivial completely integrable type is the so - called toda lattice , that admits explicit traveling wave solutions in terms of jacobian elliptic functions , see for instance @xcite . among these works",
    "@xcite was the first to reveal a connection between solitary waves with long - wave - lengths and small amplitudes and the korteweg  de vries ( kdv ) equation . by diminishing the lattice spacing the authors were able to pass to a continuum described by a kdv - equation , which is a completely integrable pde .",
    "however , since their analysis was purely formal , it did nt lead to a rigorous proof .",
    "the existence of kdv - like traveling waves in fpu chains was justified in a rigorous way much later , in the first of a series of papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , of which the other three deal with the stability theory . the proof was based on the introduction of a new framework for passing to the continuum and concerned only lattices with interations between nearest neighbours , see also @xcite for related results .",
    "the existence result @xcite is extended by herrmann and mikikits - leitner @xcite to 1d lattices with nonlocal interactions , where the original argument by a careful analysis of poles of the fourier multiplier in the complex plane is replaced by direct estimates on the real line .",
    "we mention here that for considerably general initial data with wavelength @xmath0 it is shown in @xcite that fpu solutions can be approximately expressed as the sum of two uncoupled counter - propagating kdv solutions on timescales @xmath1 .",
    "both the ansatzs employed in @xcite and @xcite can be viewed as special cases thereof .",
    "existence results on various types of waves in fpu - chains can be found in the literature .",
    "g. iooss @xcite provides a precise description of all subsonic and supersonic waves with small amplitudes via the center manifold reduction . in @xcite",
    "the existence of solitary waves with large amplitudes was proved for the first time by applying the concentration - compactness principle , see also @xcite for similar results under slightly different conditions .",
    "unimodal solitary waves are obtained in @xcite by studying a convex potential functional within a certain cone , where many different conditions for the physical potentials are collected . in all these results",
    "the wave speed is in principle unknown .",
    "however , there is a way of finding both periodic and solitary waves with any prescribed wave speed above a criticle value @xcite , which employs a special version of mountain pass theorem . in @xcite the existence of solitary waves",
    "is proved by approximation with periodic solutions , which are obtained by means of the standard mountain pass argument . aside from homoclinic waves ,",
    "heteroclinic solutions can also be found in fpu - chains : in @xcite it is shown that heteroclinic fronts exist in fpu - chains for certain convex potentials .    the investigations mentioned above concern exclusively 1d fpu - lattices . in the practice of physics , two or more dimensional fpu - lattices are more relevant , since they provide simplified models for crystals and solids such as metals , etc .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , no existence result for kdv - like waves in such fpu - lattices has been obtained except for a degenerate case @xcite , where it is assumed that the wave ( both the distance and velocity profiles ) is unidirectional and logitudinal moving along the horizontal direction .",
    "this assumption reduces the original two - dimensional system to a one - dimensional one and the geometric non - linearity arising from physical linearity due to the introduction of diagonal springs enables one to apply results from @xcite to obtain the existence of kdv - like solitary waves and also its asymptotic profile shape .    in the present paper we show an existence result for 2d fpu - lattices in a general framework , which covers different lattice geometries and allows for arbitrary propagating directions .",
    "our asymptotic approach adapts some arguments developed in @xcite , but is more sophisticated due to the two - dimensional setting .",
    "the discussion of 2d fpu - lattices in the present paper hints at similar results for 3d fpu - lattices , which have to be left for further investigations .",
    "besides , the study of stability of the resulting solutions requires ideas lying beyond the scope of the present paper and will be here completely omitted .      in this subsection",
    "we consider as an example the square lattice displayed in the left panel of figure [ lattices ] , which leads to the general system of equations .",

    "the existence of a solitary solution as given by theorem [ maintm ] involves the verification of assumptions [ ass sym ] , [ ass2 ] , [ ass inverse ] and [ ass1 ] .",
    "notice that since all the relevant effective potentials are smooth at the point @xmath355 , assumptions [ ass sym ] and [ ass1 ] are automatically satisfied .",
    "thus only two assumptions remain to be verified , which will be done numerically . for an intuitive picture we shall also give the behavior @xmath37 and @xmath356 with respect to angle @xmath15 .",
    "we first remind that gives two possible candidates for @xmath41 , but in our approach we always chose the larger solution , see .",
    "the reason is that although the other solution branch might give rise to a well - defined kdv wave in the limit @xmath116 , we can not expect the corresponding operator @xmath113 to be invertible . to see this , we observe that @xmath113 is invertible if and only if @xmath357 does not belong to the spectrum of the operator @xmath358 .",
    "since the fourier symbol of the latter is given by @xmath359 we conclude that @xmath360 where the functions @xmath361 , @xmath362 are completely determined by the coefficients @xmath34 and @xmath45 , see figure [ fig : auxfuntions ] for an illustration .",
    "moreover , by construction we have @xmath363 , so in the case of @xmath364 assumption [ ass inverse ] guarantees that @xmath365 and hence the desired invertibility of @xmath47 . for @xmath366 , however , assumption [ ass inverse ] can generically not be satisfied . in this case",
    "we expect that kdv - types waves still exist , but exhibit oscillatory tails due to resonances with the continuous spectrum .",
    "a proof of this fact would involve sophisticated arguments lying beyond the scope of the present paper , but we refer to @xcite for similar rigorous results on certain generalizations of one - dimensional fpu chains .     and",

    "as the first example we continue the discussion of the square lattice .",
    "we emphasize here as a complementary remark that the introduction of the diagonal springs leads to the non - linearity necessary for the existence of solitary waves . without diagonal springs",
    "there would be no resistance against the sheer forces and the mechanical structure would become unstable . for the expressions of the effective potentials and @xmath34",
    "see section 1.1 .",
    "the purpose of assumption [ ass2 ] is to ensure the existence of kdv traveling waves in the formal limit @xmath369 .",
    "this is actually a minimal condition for the existence of a solitary wave in its neighborhood . in figure",
    "[ figsqu ] we see that @xmath41 is always positive and it appears as oscillations around a constant and @xmath137 and @xmath370 can be defined for all @xmath371 $ ] . due to axial and rotational symmetry of the square lattice",

    "the local behavior of @xmath151 around @xmath153 complies with assumption [ ass2 ] .",
    "these graphs give numerical evidence for assumption [ ass inverse ] .    as an illustration of the @xmath15-dependence of the wave , we give in figure [ squw ] the two components of the limit velocity profiles for the same set of values of @xmath15 as in figure [ squt ] .",
    "in @xmath377 we observe the coincidence of the two components of @xmath37 , which is in consistence with the axial symmetry of the lattice with respect to the diagonal direction .",
    "the second example , which is called diamond lattice and illustrated in figure [ fig : diamondlattice ] , arises by taking out the springs on one diagonal of the square lattice and then rotating by @xmath378 degrees .",

    "@xmath398    by comparison of figures [ figsqu ] , [ figdia ] and [ figtri ] it appears that the more the symmetries the respective lattice possesses , the less dramatically @xmath41 will change with the angle @xmath15 . as shown by figure [ figtri ] , the square @xmath41 of the sound speed is constant for all @xmath15 .",
    "we have , however , no accurate formulation and no rigorous proof of this observation .    in figure [ trit ] the numerically computed function @xmath147 is given for @xmath399 , which provides numerical evidence for assumption [ ass inverse ] .    in figure [ triw ] we give kdv velocity profiles for the same set of values for @xmath15 as in figure [ diat ] .",
