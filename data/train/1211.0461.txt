    "different models based on the phenomenon of gluon saturation have offered appealing frameworks to predict and explain the observed charged - particle multiplicities in pb+pb collisions at @xmath3  gev at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , as well as their systematics from the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) to lhc : for a collection of the lhc predictions , see ref .",

    "@xcite , and a comparison with the first alice data in ref .",
    "@xcite . among these is also the so - called  ekrt  model introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , which combines perturbative qcd minijet production @xcite with a saturation of gluons to compute ( instead of fitting ) the initial conditions for the hydrodynamical evolution of the system .",
    "this model is often referred to as the  final - state saturation  model since the gluon saturation here refers to the saturation in gluon production rather than to that in the initial state ( color - glass condensate ) wave functions of the colliding nuclei .",
    "the purpose of this paper is , in addition to the implementation of the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) pqcd updates , to improve the conceptual and technical nlo framework of the ekrt modeling , to make an effort to quantify the underlying uncertainties , and to study the predictive power of the approach .",
    "we show that after the improvements this fairly robust modeling leads to a very reasonable phenomenology for the particle multiplicities and @xmath2 spectra simultaneously at rhic and the lhc .",
    "let us first look back at the key elements as well as the key predictions in the original ekrt model setups @xcite .",
    "the gluon saturation in central ( @xmath4 ) @xmath0+@xmath0 collisions was implemented through an uncertainty - relation based geometrical saturation criterion , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the number of produced minijets ( to a good first approximation all gluons ) @xcite which fall into the mid - rapidity acceptance window @xmath7 with a few - gev transverse momenta , @xmath8 .",
    "the factors @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( with @xmath11 the nuclear radius ) account for the transverse area occupied by the production of each minijet and that available in a central @xmath0+@xmath0 collision , and the proportionality constant @xmath12 was set to unity . in terms of collinear factorization ,",
    "i.e. dglap - evolved nuclear parton distribution functions ( npdfs ) @xmath13 , and perturbatively computable leading - order subcross - sections @xmath14 the minijet number can be computed as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the standard nuclear overlap function , expressed in terms of the nuclear thickness functions @xmath17 , and the hard qcd cross section is ( for the parton bookkeeping details , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath18 the  measurement function ",
    "@xcite above contains the imposed @xmath2 cut - off @xmath20 and rapidity acceptance @xmath21 , @xmath22 , \\label{eq : s2n}\\ ] ] where the labels 1 and 2 refer to the final state partons and @xmath2 to their ( identical ) transverse momentum .",
    "the functions denoted by @xmath23 are the usual step functions .",
    "the factor @xmath24 in eq .   above accounts for the nlo corrections . in the original ekrt paper",
    "@xcite a constant @xmath25 was assumed for simplicity ( and since no calculation for these existed ) but in the later setups @xcite a @xmath26-dependent @xmath24 was introduced on the basis of nlo computations of minijet @xmath1 production @xcite .",
    "once the saturation momentum @xmath27 fulfilling the criterion in eq .   is found , the amount of transverse energy carried by the minijets ( whose @xmath28 ) into the rapidity acceptance @xmath21 can be computed as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is obtained from eq .   by replacing the measurement function @xmath31 with a new one for @xmath1 , @xmath32 .",
    "\\label{eq : s2et}\\ ] ]    the initial conditions for hydrodynamics are then obtained from the computed @xmath33 and saturation scale @xmath34 by assuming that the system thermalizes essentially at formation , @xmath35 .",
    "the average initial energy density becomes then ( see @xcite ) @xmath36 . as discussed in @xcite",
    ", these initial conditions fix the rapidity density of entropy @xmath37 in the system , which in turn , with ideal hydrodynamics , is directly proportional to the final - state multiplicity . in the original ekrt framework @xcite , where hydrodynamics with only 1-dimensional bjorken scaling flow was considered , the main prediction was the obtained scaling law of the particle multiplicity , @xmath38 , where the binary collision scaling @xmath39 of independent minijet production was thus tamed to be close to a wounded - nucleon scaling , and where a definite power - law behaviour in @xmath26 was predicted .",
    "given the robusteness of the model and also that these predictions were prepared before any rhic data were available , the obtained @xmath26 scaling turned out to be surprisingly close to the one obtained with the first lhc heavy - ion alice data @xcite .",
    "another interesting observation in the original ekrt model @xcite was that the ratio @xmath40 is very close to the ratio @xmath41 of an ideal massless boson gas , which suggests that further gluon multiplication is not necessary for ( kinetic ) thermalization .",
    "this observation , together with the fact that the system becomes overdense with gluons at saturation , lends support to the early initialization time @xmath42 of the hydrodynamical evolution .    in the",
    "later , more detailed ekrt setups @xcite , where the pqcd calculation incluced the @xmath26-dependent @xmath24 factors @xcite mentioned above , the saturated minijet initial conditions served as input for ideal 1 + 1 d hydrodynamics ( central collisions , azimuthal symmetry , longitudinal scaling flow but dynamically evolving transverse flow ) once a binary - collision ( bc ) transverse profile for the energy density , @xmath43 was assumed .",
    "also a more realistic equation of state , resonance decays and centrality selection were considered in the hydrodynamical description .",
    "with such a setup , the charged - particle multiplicities measured in central au+au collisions at rhic at @xmath44  130 and 200 gev were all predicted quite nicely , see the comparison with the data in refs .",
    "remarkably , given that the prediction in ref .",
    "@xcite was made a decade before the lhc data and before the rhic @xmath45  gev data , also the corresponding multiplicity in central @xmath3  tev pb+pb collisions at the lhc was predicted reasonably well .    as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , a good agreement with the measured pion and kaon transverse momentum spectra in central au+au collisions at rhic ( @xmath46  and 200 gev ) was also obtained .",
    "the first ekrt - based results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for charged - hadron @xmath2 spectra in pb+pb collisions at the lhc suggest that the framework can be expected to work well also there . what should be emphasized with these rhic and lhc results",
    "is the robustness of the framework : due to the pressure , the @xmath47 work , the rapidity density of energy degrades by almost a factor three during the hydrodynamical evolution , so that it is quite nontrivial that a good agreement with the measured @xmath2 spectra follows .    also the centrality dependence of multiplicities in the ekrt approach has been studied , using the optical glauber model for the collision geometry and localizing the saturation criterion of eq .   in the transverse - coordinate plane @xcite . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , a good agreement with the rhic data for multiplicity - per - partipant - pair vs.  the number of participants is found when the same ( optical ) glauber model is applied also in the data analysis  for comparison , see fig .",

    "elliptic flow predictions in the ekrt framework can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite for rhic and in refs .",
    "@xcite for the lhc .",
    "inspite of the working phenomenology achieved , there are a number of open questions and shortcomings with the original ekrt model setup which we will consider in the present study :    _ ( i ) _ the formulation of the model with saturation of the number of produced gluons , @xmath6 in eq .  , is problematic , since the number of gluons can not be defined in a manner which would be collinear ( cl ) and infra - red ( ir ) singularity safe also in nlo pqcd : without introducing an extra resolution scale , how should one count soft gluons and two collinear gluons ? consequently , the factors @xmath24 in eq .",
    "can not be computed directly for @xmath6 but they have been extracted from an nlo calculation of transverse energy @xmath48 which is a cl / ir - safe quantity and can thus be rigorously defined and computed as in refs .",
    "these problems would obviously be avoided if the saturation would be required for @xmath48 instead of @xmath6 .    _",
    "( ii ) _ there are uncertainties related to the geometrical final - state saturation criterion : it has not been clear whether an explicit strong coupling constant @xmath49 should appear in eq .   if it describes a fusion of the produced gluons",
    "also , it has been unclear what is the role of the possible further proportionality constant @xmath12 in eq .  .",
    "also , if the softer gluons at @xmath50 are produced but they fuse in the overdensely populated phase space , one may ask whether the total transverse energy should still increase with the produced soft gluons ?    _ ( iii ) _ as explained above , the hydrodynamical evolution in this framework is initiated with the produced minijet transverse energy and not with their number , computed at @xmath27 once @xmath34 has been determined on the basis of the minijet number .",
    "the whole procedure of computing the produced initial energy densities for hydrodynamics would obviously become much more straightforward if the saturation criterion could be formulated for the produced @xmath48 instead of @xmath6 .    _",
    "( iv ) _ the saturation criterion in eq .   is extensive in @xmath21 on the left - hand side but not on the right - hand side ( see also the discussion in ref .",
    "since the previous studies have been made for @xmath7 , this has not been a problem in practice but obviously also this question calls for an improved formulation of the saturation criterion , where @xmath21 would explicitly appear also on the right - hand side of eq .  .",
    "( v ) _ the earlier ekrt studies ( as well as the nlo @xmath1 studies @xcite ) have so far applied only the eks98 @xcite lo npdfs in the computation of the minijet cross sections .",
    "an nlo update regarding the npdfs should be done , and also a study of the propagation of the npdf uncertainties into the hydrodynamic initial conditions and final state multiplicities should be performed .    in this paper , we address the above issues as follows : first , we reformulate the gluon saturation in terms of transverse energy per rapidity unit .",
    "this solves the first item above by removing the need for the phenomenological factors @xmath24 for @xmath6 , since we can now directly compute the saturating quantity in nlo pqcd .",
    "also the third item is then solved . to address the second item ,",
    "we show how the geometric saturation criterion without an explicit @xmath49 ( or its powers ) arises with a more detailed description of the ekrt saturation mechanism .",
    "also the fourth item gets conveniently solved with this reformulation . to address the fifth issue",
    ", we bring the nlo computation for minijet @xmath1 production up - to - date by using the eps09 nlo npdfs @xcite .",
    "we also study the npdf - originating uncertainties in the final - state multiplicities using the eps09 error sets .",
    "our aim here is to address also the uncertainties and phenomenological parameters of the approach more concretely than before . in the rigorously computable pqcd part",
    ", we discuss the freedom in defining the measurement function(s ) for the nlo @xmath1 calculation . in the more phenomenological saturation part",
    ", we quantify the uncertainty due to the unknown proportionality constant in the saturation criterion .",
    "we will also show how these uncertainties ( or rather , freedoms ) are correlated when studying the final - state multiplicities at the lhc and rhic . at the same time , we chart the predictive power of the improved ekrt framework .    once getting the pqcd+saturation part and multiplicities under improved control , we also consider the bulk hadron @xmath2 spectra in central au+au collisions at rhic and pb+pb at the lhc . to get an updated ekrt baseline for further improvements",
    ", we apply ideal hydrodynamics with a state - of - the art equation of state .",
    "it should be emphasized that our goal here is not to tune the model to fit the @xmath2 spectra at rhic and lhc as perfectly as possible but , rather , to study whether a reasonable agreement especially with the lhc @xmath2 spectra @xcite can be found , by keeping exactly the same parameter setup for rhic and lhc .",
    "we also discuss how the improved understanding of the ekrt framework presented in this paper leaves room also for further improvements such as adding dissipation ( viscosity ) into the hydrodynamical description .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : updatedekrt ] we present the improvements and updates of the nlo pqcd + saturation framework and specify our hydrodynamical setup .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] contains the obtained results for the systematics of multiplicities and @xmath2 spectra at rhic and the lhc . in sec .",
    "[ sec : outlook ] we summarize and discuss the further improvements left for future work .",
    "we take the following new angle in interpreting the saturation in the ekrt framework : instead of a saturation of the number of produced final state gluons we suggest the saturation to take place in transverse energy production when the @xmath51 and higher - order @xmath52 processes start to dominate over the conventional @xmath53 processes .",
    "the saturation should then not be considered just as final ( or initial ) state saturation but all @xmath54 processes which decrease the gluon number relative to the independent @xmath55 processes , are in effect . also , as all the higher order processes then effectively reduce the number of final - state gluons , and since the initial state gluons do not carry transverse momentum , the production of @xmath1 from the collisions at @xmath56 is conjectured to be negligible .",
    "we thus require that at saturation ( which is assumed transversally non - local here ) , the rapidity densities of the transverse energy fulfill the condition @xmath57 considering only the leading - order order cases in @xmath49 , we assign a factor @xmath58 for each of the incoming gluons ( @xmath59 for gluon pdfs , and @xmath60 ) , the factor @xmath10 for the transverse integration @xmath61 in @xmath62 , the appropriate powers of @xmath49 , the @xmath2 cut - off scale @xmath20 for the @xmath1 , the scale @xmath63 for @xmath64 , and the scale @xmath63 to compensate for the @xmath65 dimension of the extra @xmath17 in the @xmath66 case , we arrive at a scaling law @xmath67 at saturation , @xmath27 , this leads to a scaling @xmath68 for the gluon density probed at saturation . feeding this scaling back to eq .",
    "gives @xmath69 at saturation .",
    "thus , we arrive at the following geometrical - like saturation criterion for the average minijet transverse energy produced in a central @xmath0+@xmath0 collision : @xmath70 where no explicit @xmath49 appears , the rapidity interval @xmath21 ( from @xmath71 ) appears also on the right - hand side , and where the proportionality constant @xmath12 is to be determined on the basis of the measured data at one chosen cms - energy .",
    "this is the saturation conjecture we now test in the following .      the exact nlo formulation of minijet @xmath1 production , introduced originally in refs .",
    "@xcite , is based on collinear factorization and the subtraction method @xcite . as shown in eq .",
    ", the evaluation of the produced @xmath1 in central @xmath0+@xmath0 collisions is carried out by computing the first @xmath1 moment @xmath72 of the perturbative @xmath1 distribution of minijets in a single @xmath73+@xmath73 collision and including the nuclear collision geometry through the standard nuclear overlap function @xmath74 .",
    "the nlo pqcd framework is described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite but we briefly recapitulate the formulation of @xmath75 here , to discuss a generalization of the measurement functions for @xmath1 .",
    "the semi - inclusive @xmath1 distribution of minijets in a rapidity interval @xmath21 in @xmath73+@xmath73 collisions @xcite can be computed to nlo pqcd as @xmath76_2\\frac{d\\sigma^{2 \\rightarrow 2}}{d[ps]_2}s_2 + \\frac{1}{3!}\\int d[ps]_3\\frac{d\\sigma^{2 \\rightarrow 3}}{d[ps]_3}s_3 , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where the integrations take place in @xmath77 spacetime dimensions , and the @xmath55 and @xmath78 differential partonic cross sections are denoted as @xmath79_2 } & = \\frac{d\\sigma^{2 \\rightarrow 2}}{dp_{t2}dy_1dy_2d\\phi_2}\\\\ \\frac{d\\sigma^{2 \\rightarrow 3}}{d[ps]_3 } & = \\frac{d\\sigma^{2 \\rightarrow 3}}{dy_1dy_2dy_3dp_{t2}dp_{t3}d\\phi_2d\\phi_3}.   \\end{split}\\ ] ] for the two - parton final state the appropriate kinematical variables are the rapidities @xmath80 , transverse momentum @xmath81 and azimuth angle @xmath82 . from transverse momentum conservation",
    ", we have @xmath83 and @xmath84 as we do not include any intrinsic transverse momentum .",
    "similarly , for the three - parton final state , the suitable kinematical variables are @xmath85 and @xmath86 , since the transverse momentum conservation fixes @xmath87 . the measurement functions @xmath88 and @xmath89 , which depend on the four - momenta of the final - state partons , define the physical quantity to be computed . in this case",
    "this is the @xmath1 distribution of minijets which fall into a given rapidity acceptance window @xmath21 and which originate from hard ( perturbative ) collisions where at least an amount @xmath90 of transverse momentum is produced .",
    "thus , the measurement functions also define what we mean by a hard process here .    to regularize the ir / cl divergencies present in the partonic nlo cross sections , we must consider the ultraviolet(uv)-renormalized squared @xmath53 and @xmath78 scattering matrix elements of order @xmath91 , in @xmath77 dimensions and @xmath92 scheme .",
    "the divergent terms show an @xmath93 and @xmath94 behavior .",
    "the full analytical calculation for these matrix elements was done in ref .",
    "the explicit cancellation of the ir / cl divergencies takes place only if the three - parton measurement function , @xmath95 , reduces to the two - parton one , @xmath96 , in the ir and cl limits @xcite , i.e. when one of the final state partons becomes soft , or collinear with any other parton in the process .",
    "in a hard scattering of partons to nlo , we may have one , two , three or zero minijets in the rapidity acceptance region @xmath21 , which here is the mid - rapidity unit , @xmath97 all the partons are assumed massless , thus the transverse energy within @xmath21 is the sum of the absolute values @xmath98 of the transverse momenta of those partons whose rapidities are in @xmath21 : @xmath99 where the step function @xmath100 is defined as @xmath101    in the lo and nlo @xmath102 cases , where the transverse momenta are equal in magnitude , @xmath83 , the hard scatterings can be defined to be those with large enough transverse momentum , regardless of where the partons go in rapidity : @xmath103 , or equivalently , @xmath104 where @xmath20 is a fixed external parameter which does not depend on @xmath21 .",
    "this readily generalizes to the nlo @xmath105 processes as @xmath106    as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , a possible further element in defining the measurement functions here is that in the @xmath107 case we may still restrict the amount of minimum @xmath1 at @xmath21 in an ir / cl safe way : in the @xmath53 case , the non - zero @xmath1 in @xmath21 is always larger than @xmath20 , while in the @xmath107 case we can have ( and have plenty of , see @xcite ) hard processes where two partons fall outside @xmath21 and one soft parton inside . at the ir limit in this special case , we obviously have no @xmath1 in @xmath21 and the usual @xmath53 limit is correctly recovered .",
    "the other equally well ir / cl safe extreme case is that we could require the @xmath1 in @xmath21 be at least @xmath20 as always is in the @xmath55 case .",
    "the new feature introduced in the present study is that in fact _ any minimum amount of @xmath1 between 0 and @xmath20 _ constitutes an equally good , ir / cl safe restriction for the @xmath1 in @xmath21 which relaxes back to the @xmath55 case at the ir and cl limits .    by combining the definitions of @xmath1 in @xmath21 in eqs . , and together with the definition of the hard scatterings and the possible restriction of @xmath1 discussed above",
    ", the ir / cl safe measurement function @xmath96 can now be written down for the @xmath55 scatterings as @xmath108 and @xmath95 for the @xmath78 scatterings as @xmath109 where the constant @xmath110 $ ] .",
    "the measurement function @xmath95 above thus generalizes the formulation of ref .",
    "@xcite , where only the special cases @xmath111 and @xmath112 were studied . in the ir and cl limits , we can see that @xmath113 as is required for the cancellation of the corresponding divergencies .",
    "importantly , we notice already here that with the parameter @xmath114 we can control how much @xmath1 is allowed to form within a certain formation time @xmath115 , which in turn affects the hydrodynamical initial energy densities .",
    "thus , @xmath114 is a parameter of this model , whose value is to be determined from the rhic and/or lhc data as will be explained in sec .",
    "iii .    from eq .",
    "we now obtain the first moment of the semi - inclusive @xmath1 distribution as @xmath116 where , in @xmath117_2\\frac{d\\sigma^{2 \\rightarrow 2}}{d[ps]_2}\\tilde{s}_2(p_1,p_2)\\ ] ] and @xmath118_3\\frac{d\\sigma^{2 \\rightarrow 3}}{d[ps]_3}\\tilde{s}_3(p_1,p_2,p_3),\\ ] ] we have integrated the delta functions away , so that our final measurement functions can be written as @xmath119p_{t2}\\theta(p_{t2 } \\geq p_0)\\ ] ] and @xmath120 naturally , also the measurement functions @xmath121 and @xmath122 fulfil the ir / cl - safety criteria and thus the @xmath1 moment @xmath123 is a well - defined ir / cl safe quantity to compute .    as a straightforward improvement of the ekrt framework",

    "note that this choice of @xmath127 is ir / cl safe , as is required for the exact cancellation of the divergences .",

    "we are only interested in the multiplicity and @xmath2-spectra in central @xmath0+@xmath0 collisions and thus we can make some approximations in order to speed up the calculations .",

    "in this work , we introduced an improved formulation of the pqcd + saturation ( ekrt ) model @xcite , where the saturation of the gluon minijets occurs for the transverse energy , @xmath1 , rather than for the number of gluons .",
    "since the minijet @xmath1 is a quantity safe from the infrared and collinear singularities , it can be computed rigorously to nlo pqcd as a function of the minijet transverse - momentum cut - off @xmath20 .",
    "the ir / cl safe minijet @xmath1 in a chosen acceptance region is defined by measurement functions analogous to jet physics .",

    ", we formulated a dynamical saturation criterion for the minijet @xmath1 , which solves the open issues of the old ekrt - model regarding the appearance of the rapidity acceptance interval @xmath21 and powers of @xmath49 in the saturation criterion .",
    "the outcome is the ekrt - like geometrical saturation criterion for the collinearly factorized minijet @xmath1 production , containing one unknown proportionality constant @xmath12 .",
    "applying this saturation criterion to our nlo computation for the average minijet @xmath1 production in 5 % most central @xmath0+@xmath0 collisions at rhic and lhc , we determined the saturation scales @xmath34 and the amounts of @xmath1 produced into a mid - rapidity unit at saturation . in particular , we demonstrated how these depend on the model parameters @xmath114 and @xmath12 , and we also quantifed the eps09-originating error bars to these quantities .    converting the saturated minijet @xmath1 into the qcd matter energy density at @xmath35 ,",
    "thus assuming thermalization at formation , and adopting either a bc or a wn transverse profile , we obtained initial conditions for the hydrodynamic evolution . in this baseline study , where our main goal is to chart the general features and predictive power of the nlo - improved pqcd+ saturation + hydrodynamics modeling rather than a detailed fitting of the data",
    ", we restricted ourselves to boost - invariant ideal hydrodynamics with a state - of - the art pce eos @xcite .",
    "what we believe is particularly useful for understanding the initial - state phenomenology here , is that we concretely showed how the measured charged - particle multiplicities translate into the qcd - matter initial conditions through hydrodynamics ( the red bands in fig .",
    "[ etsathydro ] ) . using this mapping",
    ", we could directly see which parameter pairs @xmath196  if any - would reproduce the measured lhc and rhic charged - particle multiplicities simultaneously .",
    "remarkably , the outcome is that ( at least in this ideal - hydrodynamics framework ) such a simultaneous reproduction of multiplicities is very well possible , and that we can determine the acceptable range of values for these correlated parameters . using then one possible parameter combination , @xmath161 and @xmath160 , we computed the identified particle @xmath2 spectra for the 5 % most central @xmath0+@xmath0 collisions at rhic and lhc , fixing the kinetic decoupling temperature from the measured rhic spectra .",
    "again , the outcome is that the particle multiplicities and @xmath2 spectra are very nicely reproduced simultaneously both at rhic and the lhc  emphasizing the fact that the identified hadron @xmath2 spectra for the lhc pb+pb collisions which we obtained here , is a prediction , and not a fit to the alice @xmath2 spectra .",
    "to summarize , we have shown that the nlo - improved pqcd + saturation + ideal - hydrodynamics is a viable model for describing particle production in central heavy - ion collisions at the lhc and rhic .",

    "@xcite , we should next extend the study to non - central collisions .",

    "thanks to the recent developments , these tools now exist @xcite , so that also the localized saturation study can now be brought consistently to nlo .",
    "a localized saturation will also fix the transverse profiles of the initial energy densities in the saturated interior of the system , thus considerably decreasing the profile uncertainty . ultimately , to compute initial conditions for the event - by - event hydrodynamics ,",
    "such a localized study should be performed event - by event , using a monte carlo simulation which accounts for the fluctuations both in the number of binary @xmath198 collisions and in the minijet multiplicity ( @xmath1 ) from one @xmath198 collision to another .",
    "another very interesting line of further studies is the inclusion of dissipation , viscous corrections , to our hydrodynamic description .",
