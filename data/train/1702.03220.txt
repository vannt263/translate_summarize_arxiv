    "applications of pure mathematics in applied science are not rare . for decades differential geometry has been known as a useful tool to study lipid membranes @xcite .",
    "tu and ou - yang @xcite have published a review work on the recent theoretical advances in elasticity of membranes  which covers most of the recent and initial papers in this context .",
    "another review paper on the same issue has been published by deserno in @xcite . in this work , by using differential geometry , fluid lipid membrane as a @xmath4dimensional surface has been investigated . in @xcite the differential geometry of proteins and its applications have been presented .",
    "application of helicoidal membrane in connecting the stacked endoplasmic reticulum sheets inside the cell has been worked out by terasaki et al in @xcite and highlighted by marshall in @xcite .",
    "to the first order approximation , biological membranes are made of a bilayer of phospholipid molecules embedded in water @xcite .",
    "the physics of cell membranes including physics behind the self - assembly , molecular structures and electrical properties are given in @xcite .",
    "far from the biological ( cell- ) membranes , in the einstein theory of gravity there are objects which are called timelike thin - shells .",
    "these are basically membranes in spacetime . as the theory of general relativity itself ,",
    "the mathematical structures of such objects are very rich .",
    "although , initially the spacetime has been assigned to be @xmath5dimensional but the lower dimensional spacetime i.e. , @xmath6 is also very well known model .",
    "the analogy between the @xmath7dimensional thin - shells in @xmath8dimensional spacetime and the @xmath4dimensional surfaces in @xmath9dimensional space is the point that we shall get into in our formalism .",
    "more precisely , in this paper , we shall try to borrow concepts / mathematical rules of general relativity mainly in connections to the concept of thin - shells to develop the basic tools used in the study of ( cell- ) membranes .",
    "one of the most used concept in the early development of the biological membranes is the so called monge gauge ( mg ) .",
    "the mg @xcite is a parametrization / mapping of a @xmath4dimensional surface which is defined by a height function @xmath10 over a flat plane as a function of orthonormal coordinate on the plane @xmath11 and @xmath12 into a @xmath9dimensional flat space of coordinates @xmath13 and",
    "@xmath14 this is usually shown as@xmath15using the standard definition of the total and the gaussian curvature one finds @xcite @xmath16and@xmath17respectively . introducing @xmath18",
    "the above usually are compacted as@xmath19and@xmath20 in which the hessian @xmath21 is given by@xmath22for instance , in the famous paper of seifert and langer @xcite , the height function was set to @xmath23 + c.c.$ ] in which @xmath24 and @xmath25 are two constants . for more recent work one may look at the work of bingham , smye and olmsted @xcite .    as of @xcite and @xcite the other studies where the mg has been used , the original unperturbed surface is locally flat .",
    "however , in the case of a blood cell we may not be able to consider its membrane flat .",
    "therefore and fluctuation from its original rest shape needs to be analyzed exactly without using mg . in this study we show that in such cases one may use a proper mg which of course is not the one introduced above .",
    "spherically symmetry is the most common symmetry which occurs in nature and hence in this study we concentrate on spherically symmetric mg .",
    "let s start with a spherical shell of radius @xmath1 with some fluctuation on its surface given by the spherical height function @xmath26 in which @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the polar and azimuthal angle .",
    "unlike the cartesian height function , the non fluctuated sphere is given by @xmath27 our aim is to find the first and second fundamental forms as well as the extrinsic curvature tensor and the scalar curvature of the hypersurface @xmath28 in terms of @xmath29 only .",
    "we start with the definition of the normal vector on the surface @xmath28 given by@xmath30 in which @xmath31 is the definition of the surface @xmath28 in three dimensional flat spherical symmetric bulk space @xmath32 with line element@xmath33herein @xmath34 is defined as@xmath35 in which @xmath36 is the metric tensor of the bulk and @xmath37 .",
    "let s note that the greek letters @xmath38 are used for the bulk space while the latin letters @xmath39 shall be used for the hypersurface . using the definition ( 1 ) we find@xmath40@xmath41and@xmath42with@xmath43the induced metric on the hypersurface @xmath28",

    "we note that @xmath52 are the christoffel symbols of the second kind of the bulk space with the only nonzero components given by@xmath53@xmath54and@xmath55the components of the extrinsic curvature tensor are found to be@xmath56@xmath57@xmath58next , we find @xmath59 in order to find the total and the gaussian curvature . using the induced metric one finds@xmath60@xmath61@xmath62and@xmath63finally we find the mean curvature @xmath64 and the gaussian curvature @xmath65 given by@xmath66 in which@xmath67and@xmath68 in which@xmath69respectively .",
    "our first special case is the perfect sphere with @xmath70 this in turn implies @xmath71 and therefore@xmath72\\]]and therefore @xmath73 and @xmath74    in the second special case we set @xmath75 and consequently @xmath76 these result in@xmath77\\]]and@xmath78\\]]in which @xmath79 following @xmath59 one finds@xmath80and@xmath81     @xmath82 and @xmath83 the positive and negative @xmath84 give the left and the right respectively .",

    "1 we plot a sphere with a bump , whose equation is given by@xmath95 in which @xmath1 is the radius of the background sphere and @xmath96 and @xmath97 are constants .",
    "depending on the value of @xmath96 and @xmath97 the size of the bump changes and even get a reversed shape with negative @xmath96 ( see fig .",

    "we find @xmath129 and @xmath130 in fig .",
    "3 we plot @xmath120 and @xmath121 in terms of @xmath2 for the specific choice of the parameters presented in fig .",
    "finding the effect of a small shape fluctuation on the free energy of a membrane helps to predict the possible changes on the shape of such objects due to diverse kind of external perturbations .",
    "for instance when one taps on a soap bobble , it causes a change in its shape .",
    "we believe that the change of the shape of the soap bobble follows the minimum change of its free energy . therefore knowing how to find the geometric properties of such structure , makes our job simpler . some of the @xmath4dimensional surfaces can be approximated as a local flat surface and any fluctuation is considered as the mg .",
    "but in more general cases the unperturbed surface may not fit on a flat surface neither locally nor globally . in such cases a different version of the mg",
    "may be more helpful . in this work",
    "we have introduced the spherical mg in its most general form . with some specific cases and examples",
    "we have shown the application of this formalism .",
    "our next step will be to find the mg for toroidal and cylindrical surfaces ."
