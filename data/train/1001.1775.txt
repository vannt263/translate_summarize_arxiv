    "in his celebrated study on the theory of rough paths  @xcite , t.  j.  lyons introduced the following neo - classical inequality , which was a key estimate to prove one of the fundamental theorems  ( * ? ? ? * theorem  2.2.1 ) :    [ th : neo1 ] let @xmath0 $ ] , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "then , we have @xmath4    here , in general , we define @xmath5 for @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the gamma function . if @xmath9 appears in the denominator of the right - hand side of equation  , @xmath10 is regarded as @xmath11 .    when @xmath12 , the equality holds in , which is just the conventional binomial theorem",
    ". therefore , theorem  [ th : neo1 ] is regarded as a generalisation of the binomial theorem .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ th : neo1 ] in @xcite is rather technical and is derived from the maximum principle for sub - parabolic functions .",
    "based on the numerical evidence , lyons conjectured that coefficient @xmath13 in the left - hand side of inequality   could be replaced by @xmath14 . thus far , only partial positive answers were known : e.  r.  love  @xcite proved that the conjecture is true for @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) and that coefficient @xmath13 in can be replaced by @xmath17 in general .",
    "his proof is based on the duplication formula of the gamma function ; it seems difficult to use his method to provide a complete answer to the conjecture . some detailed calculation along the lines of his method",
    "has also been carried out in @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we provide an affirmative answer to lyons conjecture with more explicit information .",
    "our method is different from the methods mentioned above ; in our method , we use the basic theory of complex analysis .",
    "the answer to the conjecture is stated as follows .",
    "[ th : main ] let @xmath0 $ ] , @xmath18 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "then , we have @xmath19 the equality holds if and only if @xmath12 or @xmath20 .",
    "when @xmath12 or @xmath20 holds , it is evident that inequality   holds with equality .",
    "moreover , when @xmath21 and only one of @xmath22 and @xmath23 is @xmath11 , inequality   is trivial with strict inequality .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to prove with strict inequality for @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "we may assume that @xmath27 by symmetry . by dividing both sides by @xmath28 and letting @xmath29 , it is sufficient to prove the following : for @xmath24 , @xmath18 , and @xmath30 , @xmath31 in fact , we can prove the following identity .",
    "[ th : main2 ] let @xmath32 , @xmath18 , and @xmath30 .",
    "then , we have @xmath33    since the right - hand side of equation   is clearly less than @xmath34 for @xmath24 , theorem  [ th : main2 ] immediately implies that inequality   is valid ; therefore , theorem  [ th : main ] is proved . when @xmath35 , the right - hand side of is greater than @xmath34",
    "therefore , in this case , the converse inequalities of and are known as the byproducts .",
    "theorem  [ th : main2 ] is proved by the application of the fractional order taylor - like expansions with residual terms , which are obtained from the basic theory of complex analysis .    to show that coefficient @xmath14 is the best constant , we denote the right - hand side of equation   by @xmath36 .",
    "then , for fixed @xmath24 and @xmath37 $ ] , the error term @xmath38 monotonically converges to @xmath11 as @xmath39 since the integrand decreases to @xmath11 pointwisely . in this sense",
