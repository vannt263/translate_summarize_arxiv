    "the electric and magnetic proton form factors can be obtained from the measurement of the elastic @xmath3 cross section .",
    "the data are usually analyzed via the rosenbluth separation technique .",
    "this amounts to write the reduced cross section , in the one - photon - exchange approximation , in units of the mott cross section , as follows : @xmath4 @xmath5 being the scattering angle , @xmath6 the four momentum transfer , @xmath7 the proton mass . for a given @xmath6 value several measurements at different scattering angles",
    "are performed and then the magnetic @xmath8 and electric @xmath9 form factors can be simultaneously extracted ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    since the beginning of the 90 s new longitudinally polarized electron beams became available . from that time , experiments on the elastic scattering of polarized electrons on unpolarized or polarized target started . in the experiments on the scattering of polarized electron on unpolarized proton target ( @xmath10 )",
    "the transverse and longitudinal polarization of the recoil protons were measured .",
    "the ratio of these quantities is proportional ( in born approximation ) to the form factors ratio @xmath11 . in the experiments on the scattering of polarized electrons on a polarized target ( @xmath12 )",
    "the asymmetry was measured .",
    "this observable is also a function of the ratio of the electric and magnetic form factors .",
    "it turned out that the ratio @xmath11 obtained from polarization measurements  @xcite , for values of the four momentum transfer above 3  gev@xmath13 , is in disagreement with the same quantity evaluated with the proton form factors extracted with the rosenbluth separation technique .",
    "an obvious remark is that the rosenbluth separation method works less efficiently at large @xmath6 , the reason being that with increasing @xmath6 the term @xmath14 becomes significantly smaller than @xmath15 [ see eq.([sigma_reduced ] ) ] .",
    "moreover it turns out that even a tiny additional correcting term to the reduced cross section ( of the order of a few percent of the total @xmath16 ) can significantly affect the extracted value of @xmath17 and hence the form factor ratio @xmath11 . for most cross section data",
    "the `` classical '' radiative corrections have been applied @xcite .",
    "this however could not solve the problem of the inconsistency between the form factor ratio obtained from rosenbluth technique and polarization measurements .",
    "the possibility to solve this problem by taking into account the contribution of the two - photon exchange corrections ( tpe ) was considered in different papers ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these corrections are natural candidate for solving the above outlined inconsistency .",
    "indeed , at large @xmath18 the contribution of tpe corrections to the reduced cross section is of the order of @xmath19 .",
    "it has been shown that , by including tpe corrections in the data analysis , one can extract from the rosenbluth separation proton electromagnetic form factors which are in agreement with the results of polarization measurements  @xcite .",
    "it has been also shown that tpe corrections to the ratio of the transverse and longitudinal polarization of the recoil protons are smaller than experimental errors  @xcite and can be , at present , neglected .",
    "the above problem has been extensively studied by many authors from the phenomenological and theoretical point of view ( for a recent review see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . on the theoretical side",
    "the major difficulty is to take into account properly intermediate hadronic states , which contribute to the tpe amplitude  @xcite .",
    "however , the two - photon exchange contribution can be parameterized phenomenologically and the corresponding parameters can be determined from the experimental data  @xcite .    in the elastic electron - proton scattering process",
    "the leading tpe contribution is given by the interference between the born and the tpe amplitudes . as a consequence the correcting term is proportional to the real ( dispersive ) part of the tpe amplitude and turns out to be odd in the charge of the projectile .",
    "hence the tpe correction has opposite signs for electron - proton and positron - proton scattering . for this reason the measurement of the ratio @xmath20 provides a unique and model - independent possibility to determine the magnitude of the tpe correction .",
    "another possibility to measure the tpe effect is by observing the non - linearity in @xmath21 of the rosenbluth data ( see e. g. fig .",
    "[ fig_sigmar ] ) , which is implicated by the symmetry properties of the interaction @xcite . however , up to now such nonlinearities are not visible @xcite .",
    "accurate measurements of new rosenbluth data in a wide @xmath21 range are required to study this effect .",
    "measurements of the ratio ( [ ratio_ep ] ) were performed in the 60 s . in fig .",
    "[ fig_ratio_ep ] some of the slac data  @xcite for the ratio @xmath22 are shown .",
    "one can see that the experimental uncertainties do not allow to draw any definite conclusion on the presence of tpe corrections , since the data are compatible with @xmath23 .",
    "two new experiments are under preparation , which will measure the elastic electron(positron)-proton scattering cross sections with higher accuracy",
    ". one of them will take place at the vepp-3 storage ring  @xcite , the approximate beam energy being around 1.6  gev .",
    "measurements at @xmath24 and @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath27  gev@xmath13 , respectively , are proposed .",
    "the second experiment was proposed at jlab  @xcite . here",
    "a wide range of @xmath28 will be explored , with @xmath6 in the range @xmath29  gev@xmath13 .    in this letter",
    "we give the expected value for the ratio @xmath22 , in the kinematical range accessible to the above mentioned two new experiments .",
    "our results are determined from the global fit of the @xmath1 elastic data  @xcite .",
    "we provide our predictions with the corresponding uncertainties , which are also obtained from our global fit .",
    "in ref .  @xcite we performed a global fit of the @xmath1 elastic cross section and polarization data .",
    "the cross section data were fitted by taking into account a tpe correcting term , which was added to the reduced cross section , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , as follows : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the tpe correction , due to one- and two - photon interference . on the other hand ,",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the polarization data are practically not affected by tpe corrections .",
    "a decrease of the cross section due to a negative tpe correction allowed us to obtain form factors whose ratio is in agreement with the polarization data . since the polarization data are necessary for the extraction of the tpe correction through the comparison with the cross section data , the global fit in ref .",
    "@xcite was limited to the kinematical range of the polarization data .",
    "the dependence on @xmath21 of @xmath32 is constrained by the requirements of charge conjugation and crossing symmetry  @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", @xmath31 should satisfy the relation @xmath33 where @xmath34    based on the above properties chen  _ at al . _",
    "@xcite proposed two parameterizations of the tpe term . in both of them",
    "the @xmath6 dependence was given by the dipole form factor @xmath35 which was multiplied by functions of @xmath36 .",
    "such a @xmath6 dependence is heuristically justified by its simplicity and the effectiveness in the fit of the data ( however , a different @xmath6 dependence with double poles at @xmath37 and @xmath38 was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite we employed the form @xmath39 which is one of the functional forms proposed in ref .",
    "the best fit values obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for the parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 are @xmath42 with 1@xmath43 uncertainties given by the square - roots of the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix values in the parameter space are given in http://www.nu.to.infn.it/pap/08/ff/ff.php . ] .",
    "in the following the uncertainties are evaluated using the correlated systematic uncertainties of the parameters obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite through a standard least - squares analysis of the data .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_sigmar ] we plot the reduced cross sections ( divided by @xmath44 ) , computed for two @xmath6 values , 1.75 and 5  gev@xmath13 : the solid lines correspond to our global fit  @xcite , including the tpe term .",
    "we recall that the goodness of fit ( gof ) was gof = 71% . by comparing the lines with and without tpe correction",
    ", one can see that the estimated tpe correction is small ( of the order of a few percent ) , the major effect appearing at small @xmath21 values ( which correspond to the largest @xmath36 values ) .",
    "we now discuss our prediction for the ratio @xmath22 , which was already shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_ratio_ep ] together with the old slac data . in this figure , for each point we computed the ratio ( [ ratio_ep ] ) using the proton form factors and tpe correction term from our global data fit .",
    "the predicted points are plotted with the @xmath2 uncertainty .",
    "although our prediction for the ratio is well above one at small epsilon , the slac data do not have sufficient accuracy to reveal a significant deviation from unity .",
    "in the same figure we display also the two points which are going to be measured in the vepp-3 experiment  @xcite .",
    "for the kinematical conditions of this experiment we obtained @xmath45 where the @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath2 errors are indicated .",
    "the predicted ratios are clearly above one , by more than @xmath2 .    our predictions for the ratio @xmath22 for the kinematical conditions of the e04 - 116 jlab experiment  @xcite",
    "are presented in fig .",

    "the foreseen accuracy of measurements will be sufficient to reveal the predicted deviation from unity of @xmath48 .",
    "for the vepp-3 experiment the systematic uncertainty is estimated to be below 0.3% , while for the jlab project it is predicted to be smaller than 1.0% .",

    "[ fig_ratio_ep4 ] we compare our predictions for @xmath48 with those computed with pqcd in ref .  @xcite .",

    "@xcite corresponding to @xmath51 and @xmath52  gev@xmath13 . our predictions for @xmath48 are systematically lower than those in ref .",
    "@xcite , but there is an agreement at the @xmath47 level .",
    "as it is well known , the ratio of the electric and magnetic form factors of the proton obtained from the measurement of the polarization of the recoil proton in the scattering of polarized electrons on unpolarized protons and that obtained from the measurement of the cross section in the elastic @xmath53-scattering are not compatible with each other .",
    "it was suggested in several papers @xcite that this discrepancy can be resolved if one includes two - photon - exchange corrections .",
    "if the hypothesis of the importance of the two - photon exchange term is correct , then , due to the interference of the one - photon and two - photon amplitudes , the cross sections in @xmath53 and @xmath54 elastic scattering are different .",
    "these cross sections were measured in the past at slac @xcite , however the large errors in this experiment did not allow to draw definite conclusions about the tpe term .",
    "two new high - precision experiments on the measurement of the ratio @xmath48 of the cross sections of @xmath55 elastic scattering are now at preparation at the vepp-3 storage ring @xcite and at jlab @xcite .    having in mind these experiments , in this letter we performed the calculation of the ratio @xmath48 in the ranges of @xmath18 and @xmath21 which will be covered by these future measurements .",
