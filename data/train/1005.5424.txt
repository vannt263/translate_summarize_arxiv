    "a large scale endeavor has been undertaken by the rbc and ukqcd collaborations in the last few years to simulate 2 + 1 flavor full qcd with dynamical domain wall fermions ( dwf ) and iwasaki gauge action on several lattices with pion mass as low as @xmath13 mev and volume large enough for mesons ( @xmath14 )  @xcite .",
    "three sets of lattices @xmath15 and @xmath16 at @xmath17 gev and @xmath18 at @xmath19 gev with the fifth dimension @xmath20 are available , each with 3 to 4 sea quark masses with the lowest pion mass at @xmath13 mev . with these lattices , one can proceed to perform chiral extrapolation and continuum extrapolation assuming @xmath21 dependence of the physical quantities .",
    "since the domain wall fermion with @xmath20 is a good approximation for the chiral fermion satisfying ginsparg - wilson relation , it is shown that they have good chiral properties and that most of the chiral symmetry breaking effects are absorbed in the residual mass which is reasonably small for these set of lattices . as such ,",
    "these dynamical fermion configurations are very valuable and can be used to calculate physical quantities reliably , at least for the mesons .",
    "it is suggested from the study of the nucleon axial coupling @xmath22 and electromagnetic form factors that the present lattices are still small and lattices with spatial dimension of 6 fm might be needed in order to control the finite volume errors .",
    "while combined chiral extrapolation and continuum extrapolation are being carried out with valence domain wall fermions , we shall explore the viability of employing valence overlap fermions on these dwf configurations .",
    "both the domain wall fermion and the overlap fermion are chiral fermions . as such",
    ", they do not have @xmath23 errors and non - perturbative renormalization via chiral ward identities or the rom / ri scheme can be implemented relatively easily  @xcite . furthermore , the overlap fermion has additional desirable features which one can take advantage of in order to improve chiral symmetry as well as the quality of the numerical results .",
    "first of all , the numerical implementation of the overlap fermion allows a precise approximation of the matrix sign function so that the errors on the sign function and thus the residual mass can be as small as @xmath24 in practice  @xcite .",
    "the approximation to the exact chiral symmetry can also be gauged from the ginsparg - wilson and the gell - mann - oakes - renner relations .",
    "its multi - mass algorithm permits calculation of multiple quark propagators covering the range from very light quarks to the charm on these sets of dwf lattices .",
    "this makes it possible to include the charm quark for calculations of charmonium and charmed - light mesons using the same fermion formulation for the charm and light quarks  @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to incorporate partially quenched data in the chiral extrapolation .",
    "since the overlap operator is a normal matrix , it is easier to calculate its eigenmodes and implement low - mode deflation in the matrix inversion .",
    "as we shall see , this can speed up the inversion of small quark mass by more than an order of magnitude with no critical slowing down .",
    "furthermore , these low frequency modes can be used together with the noise approximation of the high - frequency modes to construct all - to - all or many - to - all correlators .",
    "we shall show that using @xmath9 grid source on a time slice is quite efficient in reducing variance for both the meson and baryon correlators .",
    "we should point out that although both the overlap and domain wall fermions are chiral fermions , using overlap valence on dwf gauge configurations with hyp smearing at finite lattice spacing constitutes a mixed action approach .",
    "mixed action approaches have been studied by many groups such as dwf valence on staggered fermion sea  @xcite , overlap valence on dwf sea  @xcite , overlap valence on clover sea  @xcite , and overlap valence on twisted fermion sea  @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the valence chiral fermion has the advantage that it introduces only one extra low - energy constant @xmath7 in the mass of the pseudoscalar meson with mixed valence and sea quarks which has the same effect as partial quenching .",
    "the mixed action partially quenched chiral perturbation theory ( mapq@xmath25pt ) which has been worked out for various physical quantities with various combination of fermion actions will be the simplest for the combination of overlap valence and dwf sea .",
    "this manuscript is organized as follows : the formalism for solving linear equation of the overlap operator with low eigenmode deflation and @xmath9 noise grid for the many - to - all correlators will be given in sec .",
    "the numerical details on the tuning of the negative mass parameter @xmath26 in the wilson kernel of the overlap , the speedup due to hyp smearing and low - mode deflation , and the role of the zero mode will be presented in sec .",
    "3 . in sec . 4",
    ", we shall present the calculation of @xmath7 and results for the meson and nucleon correlators with point source , @xmath9 grid source , and @xmath9 grid source with low - mode substitution .",
    "the efficacy of the many - to - all approach will be discussed .",
    "we will finish with a summary in sec .",
    "the massless overlap operator  @xcite is defined as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the matrix sign function and @xmath29 is taken to be the hermitian wilson - dirac operator , i.e. @xmath30 . here @xmath31 is the usual wilson fermion operator , except with a negative mass parameter @xmath32 in which @xmath33 . as",
    "will explained later in sec .",
    "[ num ] , we will use @xmath34 in our calculation which corresponds to @xmath35 .",
    "the massive overlap dirac operator is defined so that at the tree - level there is no mass or wavefunction renormalization  @xcite , @xmath36 throughout the paper , we shall use the lattice units for dimensionful quantities , except the lattice spacing @xmath37 will be explicit in figures .",
    "it has been advocated  @xcite that using deflation with low eigenmodes can speed up inversion of fermion matrices .",
    "it has been applied to the hermitian system  @xcite to speed up the inner loop inversion of the overlap operator and to non - hermitian  @xcite and hermitian system with multiple right - hand sides  @xcite .",
    "low - mode deflation has also been applied to domain decomposition  @xcite .",
    "in addition to speeding up inversions , substituting exact low eigenmodes in the noise estimation such as in quark loops  @xcite and all - to - all correlators  @xcite has demonstrated that better results for the meson two- and three - point functions can be obtained with reduced errors .    the massive overlap dirac operator in eq .",
    "( [ massive_ov ] ) has the same eigenvectors as the massless one , we shall consider the massless dirac overlap @xmath38 . due to the normality of @xmath38 , i.e. @xmath39 and the ginsparg - wilson relation @xmath40 , the eigenvalues of @xmath38 are on a unit circle with the center at unity .",
    "the real and chiral modes are at 0 and 2 .",
    "others on the circle are paired with conjugate eigenvalues . in other words ,",
    "if @xmath41 is an eigenvector of @xmath38 @xmath42 then @xmath43 is also an eigenvector with eigenvalue @xmath44 , @xmath45 to calculate the eigenmodes of @xmath38 , one notes that due to normality and @xmath46 hermiticity @xmath47 , @xmath46 commutes with @xmath48 , i.e. @xmath49 = 0 $ ] .",
    "therefore , one can use the arnoldi algorithm to search for eigenmodes of @xmath48 with real eigenvalues @xmath50 which are doubly degenerate with opposite chirality . to obtain the eigenmodes of @xmath38",
    ", one can diagonalize the two chiral modes in @xmath38 .",
    "this is much easier than searching in the complex plane for the eigenmodes of non - normal fermions . since the non - zero modes are conjugate pairs ( eq .",
    "( [ conjugate ] ) ) , we need only to save half of them , e.g.  those with positive imaginary eigenvalues .",
    "when the eigenmodes are calculated , one can proceed with deflation by solving the high frequency part of the propagator @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the projection operator to filter out the low eigenmodes .",
    "@xmath53 is the number of zero modes which are either all left - handed or all right - handed in each configuration .",
    "@xmath54 is the number of non - zero low - frequency modes which come in conjugate pairs . in solving eq .",
    "( [ xh1 ] ) , we use the conjugate gradient solver ( cgne ) for @xmath55 . in this case",
    ", one can utilize the property @xmath56 to save a matrix multiplication in each iteration with the chiral source @xmath57  @xcite and the solution @xmath58 has the same chirality as the source . in this case , eq .",
    "( [ xh1 ] ) can be written as @xmath59 where the sum is over the zero modes and the low modes on the upper half of the eigenvalue circle .",
    "although we do not calculate it this way , the high frequency part of the propagator can be written as @xmath60 the total high frequency part of the propagator will be , in the end @xmath61 given that the source @xmath62 .    to accommodate the @xmath63 chiral transformation with @xmath64  @xcite which leads to chirally covariant flavor octet quark bilinear currents in the form @xmath65",
    ", it is usually convenient to use the chirally regulated field @xmath66 in lieu of @xmath67 in the interpolation field and the currents .",
    "this turns out to be equivalent to leaving unchanged the unmodified interpolation field and currents and adopting instead the effective propagator @xmath68 which also serves to filter out the unphysical eigenmode at @xmath69  @xcite .    defining @xmath70 and @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the high / low frequency part of the effective propagator , @xmath73 originating from the source @xmath74",
    "can be obtained , after a few steps of derivation , as @xmath75 it is worthwhile pointing out from eq .",
    "( [ sh ] ) that once @xmath76 is solved , there is no need to explicitly multiply @xmath38 on @xmath76 which involves an inversion of the kernel @xmath77 in the zolotarev approximation of the matrix sign function .",
    "similarly , the low frequency part of @xmath78 can be obtained from spectral decomposition @xmath79 since the eigenmodes are available for the low frequency modes , one can obtain the all - to - all propagator for this part of the spectrum @xmath80 in the above expressions , we have suppressed the dirac and color indices .",
    "it is shown  @xcite that when noise is used to estimate the meson two- and three - point correlation functions in the connected insertion , substituting the noise estimated low - mode part of the correlator with the exact one improves statistics .",
    "consider , for example , the meson correlator from the local interpolation fields @xmath81 where the two - point correlator is @xmath82\\rangle,\\ ] ] where the source @xmath74 is on the @xmath83 time slice with support on @xmath84 .",
    "since the quark propagator @xmath78 is composed of the low - frequency and high - frequency parts @xmath85 , the two - point correlation function can be decomposed into the following @xmath86 where @xmath87 the noise @xmath74 has the property @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the noise average . the standard error due to the noise estimation of the correlation function averaged over the gauge configurations",
    "is given by  @xcite @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the variance of the gauge / noise ensemble , and @xmath92 is the number of gauge / noise configurations .",
    "how good the approximation is depends on the noise estimation . through the numerical study of the quark loop for the energy - momentum tensor with the wilson fermion on",
    "quenched gauge configurations , it is learned  @xcite that @xmath93 is much larger than @xmath94 with @xmath95 for the case with ( without ) 4-term unbiased subtraction . as such",
    ", it is desirable to replace the noise estimate of @xmath96 with the exact correlator to reduce variance due to the noise estimation .",
    "the low - mode substituted meson correlator is then @xmath97 with @xmath98 where the sum of @xmath99 runs over the set g with the same support on @xmath84 as the noise @xmath74 .    in the case of baryon",
    ", one can use the @xmath100 noise on a time slice for the quark source due to the property @xmath101 so that it is an approximation for the superposition of multiple baryon source with three quarks in each of the baryon originating from the same spatial location on the support of the @xmath9 noise .",
    "similar to the meson case , one can substitute @xmath102 , which is the part with all three quarks estimated by @xmath103 , with @xmath104 where all three quark propagators are given in terms of @xmath105 . in addition",
    ", one can replace the @xmath106 part , where one of the quark propagators is @xmath107 and the other two are @xmath103 , by @xmath108 in which the product of the two @xmath103 is replaced by @xmath109 .",
    "@xmath110 where @xmath111 refers to the set of correlators with permutation of @xmath112 and @xmath103 ( or @xmath105 ) for the three different quarks in the baryon .",
    "it is worthwhile pointing out that @xmath108 is like @xmath113 in the meson in the sense that the error due the noise is from @xmath93 associated with eq .",

    "to summarize , we have carried out a study of calculating overlap fermion propagators and hadron correlators on the @xmath0 flavor domain wall fermion configurations on @xmath115 , and @xmath3 lattices with both deflation in the inversion and low - mode substitution in constructing the correlators .    with hyp smearing and low - mode deflation ,",
    "we find a speed up from @xmath238 23 for the @xmath1 lattice with 200 pairs of eigenmodes and @xmath291 51 for the @xmath2 lattice with 200 pairs of eigenmodes to @xmath292 for the larger @xmath3 lattice with 400 pairs of eigenmodes .",
    "the cost of the overhead for calculating eigenmodes is 4.5 , 4.9 and 7.9 propagators for the above lattices , respectively , which will be amortized with calculation of propagators for more sources .",
    "we have calculated the quark mass dependence of the hyperfine splitting and find that one can accommodate charm quarks with small @xmath6 error . since this is a mixed action approach with overlap on dwf sea , we use the finite volume boundary condition property of the scalar correlator to estimate the low - energy constant @xmath7 for finite lattice spacing which is needed for the mixed action partially quenched chiral perturbation theory extrapolation to the physical point and the continuum limit .",
    "the preliminary result of @xmath293 turns out to be small .",
    "it only shifts the 300 mev mixed valence - sea pion mass by @xmath8 mev at @xmath167 gev for the @xmath3 lattice and @xmath294 mev at @xmath236 gev for the @xmath2 lattice .",
    "we have examined the signal - to - noise issue for the connected hadron correlators from the noise source on a time slice and found that the noise wall source is worse than the point source for all mesons except the pion .",
    "it is worse still for the baryon ( and multi - quark systems ) by a @xmath295 factor where @xmath252 is the 3-volume of the time slice .",
    "the situation can be ameliorated by reducing the contamination from neighboring sites with less source points .",
    "this introduces the idea of a noise grid source with support on some uniformly spaced grid points on a time slice . on the other hand , we find that the low - frequency part of the multiple hadron source with exact eigenmodes is highly correlated so that , beyond 64 grid points on a time slice of the @xmath3 lattice , the relative errors of the meson correlators do not decrease .",
    "these observations led to a suggestion of a new algorithm for the grid noise with low - mode substitution to reduce the variance from noise contamination while addressing the low - mode correlation at the same time .",
    "we decide to use 64 @xmath9 grid noise and low - mode substitution with 400 pairs of eigenmodes on the @xmath3 lattice with the light sea mass @xmath119 to calculate both the meson and baryon correlators .",
    "we find that for light quarks ( pion masses at 200 - 300 mev ) , the errors of the mesons and nucleon masses can be reduced by a factor of @xmath238 3 to 4 as compared to the point source . in the strange quark region ,",
    "the statistical errors of the pion and nucleon masses can be improved by a factor @xmath12 , but it is not much improved for the vector meson .",
    "we find that the results from low - mode substitution start to degrade beyond the strange quark region .",
    "this is due to the fact that the signal falls off quickly at large @xmath186 and yet the variance of the noise estimation of the high - frequency and the mixed high- and low - frequency parts of the correlator does not fall .",
    "luckily , the @xmath9 grid results are still better than the the point source and can reduce the errors of the charmonium masses by a factor of @xmath12 .",
    "one can use it to address the hadrons involving the charm quark .",
    "we should point out that the interplay between the noise grid source and low - mode substitution is quite general and is not restricted to a particular fermion action .",
    "so far the study of two - point functions has been favorable .",
    "the three - point function with @xmath9 grid source and low - mode substitution will undoubtedly pose a different set of challenges .",
