    "the explosion of a type ia supernova begins with the combustion at the center of a chandrasekhar mass white dwarf of carbon - oxygen ( c+o ) or oxygen - neon - magnesium ( o+ne+mg ) fuels .",
    "the heat is transported mainly by conduction due to degenerate and completely relativistic electrons as a subsonic deflagration wave propagatating outwardly of the star .",
    "the deflagration front born laminar is subject to several hydrodynamic instabilities such as landau - darrieus ( ld ) and rayleigh taylor ( rt ) instability ( arnett & livne 1994 , khokhlov 1993 ) that produce an increment of the area at which the nuclear reactions take place .",
    "this causes an increase of the nuclear energy generation rate and consequently an acceleration of the front .",
    "the combustion front is stabilized by the merging of cells , the formation of cusps , and the expansion of the exploding star .",
    "this leads to the formation of a cellular structure at microscopic scales .",
    "the bubbles that grow due to rt instability are also subject to kelvin - helmoltz ( kh ) or shear instability when nonlinear stabilization fails .",
    "the onset of the kh instability marks the transition to the fully developed turbulence regime at the lower scales . during this , fluid motions are characterized by the formation of a turbulent cascade in the inertial scales where viscous dissipation is not important . this turbulence can be described by the kolmogorov s scaling law .    the fractal model for the combustion ( e.g. , timmes & woosley 1992 , niemeyer & woosley 1997 ) has achieved some success on describing the acceleration of wrinkled flames both in experiments and also in numerical simulations .",
    "the velocity of the flame in this case is given by :    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the effective fractal velocity and @xmath5 is the laminar velocity of the flame ; @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the greatest and minimum scales , respectively , of preturbations which are r - t unstable ; and d is the fractal dimension of the front .",
    "the derivation of the value of d for a turbulent combustion regime has given @xmath8 ( see ghezzi , de gouveia dal pino & horvath 2001 ) , which is in agreement with previous numerical results ( blinnikov , sasorov & woosley 1995 ) .",
    "we have incorporated the effects of magnetic fields on the fractal growth of the combustion front assuming that the progenitor star of a sn ia is a magnetized white dwarf with a centered dipolar magnetic field with strengths at the surface @xmath9 g ( see jordan 1992 ) and roughly 10 times greater near the center . using the fractal model described above we have found that the presence of the magnetic field causes the effective velocity of the flame at the magnetic poles ( @xmath10 ) to be larger than that at the equator of the star thus producing an asymmetry in the explosion of the sn ia ( ghezzi , de gouveia dal pino & horvath 2001 ) :    @xmath11    for the evaluation of this equation we have used a fractal dimension @xmath12 , and taken the remaining data from timmes & woosley ( 1992 ) .",
    "we note that our analysis is applicable only for densities @xmath13 , since the turbulent motions could destroy the corrugated flamelet regime for lower densities ( niemeyer & woosley 1997 ) , and in this case the fractal model is no longer aplicable .",
    "figure 1 displays the percentage of asymmetry in the velocity field as a function of the internal magnetic field strength at a a middle radial distance @xmath14 from the center of the star ( where the fuel density is @xmath15 ) for white dwarfs with different compositions . for example , for a composition of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , we have used @xmath18 .",
    "we see that the asymmetry is sensitive to the composition of the progenitor .",
    "heavier progenitors show higher asymmetries since their laminar velocities are smaller , so that the kinetic energy term becomes less dominant with respect to the magnetic energy term in the asymmetry equation above .",
    "figure 2 shows the asymmetry on the combustion front at a density @xmath19 . the total asymmetry increases with increasing radius ( or decreasing density ) and is larger for progenitors with heavier compositions .",
    "an asymmetry in the velocity field is developed by the presence of a dipolar magnetic field during the fractal growth of the deflagration front of a type ia supernova that can lead to the formation of a prolate remnant .",
    "the magnetic field introduces an effective surface tension in the equator of the white dwarf progenitor that reduces the velocity of the combustion front at the equator , @xmath20 , with respect to the velocity at the poles , @xmath10 , so that @xmath21 .",
    "the asymmetry is larger for heavier progenitors . in particular , for progenitors with a composition @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and surface magnetic fields @xmath24 g , a @xmath25 to @xmath26 asymmetry has been found at a middle distance from the center of the star ( see fig .",
    "2 ) .    as only a small fraction of the observed white dwarfs",
    "are inferred to have magnetic fields higher than about @xmath27 g , asymmetries are not expected to occur very frequently .",
    "nonetheless , recent spectropolarimetric observations have revealed a linear polarization component in the radiation of very young sn ia remnants , which suggests that prolate atmospheres with asymmetries @xmath28 are producing it ( see leonard , filippenko , & matheson 1999 , wang , wheeler & hflich 1997 and howell , hoeflich , wang & wheeler 2001 ) .",
    "the model presented here offers a plausible explanation for such observations .",
    "the asymmetry has lower values at higher densities .",
    "so this figure represent the lower values for the asymmetry , since the central density values of the progenitors are of the order of @xmath31 @xmath30 . from this figure",
    "is possible to see that heavier compositions show higher asymmetry values .",
    "asymmetry percentage for two different progenitors with compositions @xmath32 @xmath33 , for the full line and @xmath34 @xmath35 , for the dotted line .",
    "the calculation were made at a density of @xmath36 ."
