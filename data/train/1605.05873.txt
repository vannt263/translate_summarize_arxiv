    "catalytically active janus micro - spheres are capable of autonomous motion and can potentially act as carriers for transportation @xcite .",
    "when hard colloidal particles are held in suspension , in a bath of smaller passive colloids under brownian motion , attractive interactions between the large colloidal particles arises by means of depletion forces .",

    "hence , the total entropy increases , as shown in the pioneering paper of asakura and oosawa @xcite almost fifty years ago .",
    "however , the excluded volume effect observed in equilibrium systems can not be the sole cause for the effective interaction between passive colloids in a bath of active particles @xcite .",

    "this is very surprising , and opposite to what has been recently observed for the interaction between paralell hard - walls @xcite , also in a bath of spp .",
    "as will be discussed along the manuscript , the clustering of spp on the surface of passive objects is the reason for the depletion interaction in a bath of spp @xcite .",

    "our system consists of two passive elliptical colloids ( pec ) in a 2d bath of @xmath1 active particles ( or spp ) .",
    "the spp are modelled as soft disks of diameter @xmath2 which interact with each other and with the pec through spring - like forces of stiffness @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , with @xmath5 .",
    "each spp moves with velocity @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the magnitude of the self - propulsion velocity . in every timestep @xmath8",

    "the force on the pec is the negative of this force , i.e. , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the spp - pec overlap .",

    "we proceed in this way by considering two pec at fixed separation and by calculating their interaction with the active particles .",
    "specifically , we calculate the average force @xmath65 , along the @xmath38-direction , exerted on the left ellipse ( fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] ) by the bath of active particles , which is the same in magnitude to the average force exerted on the right ellipse .",
    "we define @xmath64 as the distance between the closest points of the two passive elliptical colloids ( fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] ) .",
    "it is convenient to define a dimensionless parameter @xmath66 . for the case",

    "the ellipses have their major axis along the @xmath45-direction ( vertical ellipses ) , while for @xmath69 the ellipses have their major axis along the @xmath38-direction ( horizontal ellipses ) .",
    "we always consider the minor axis of the pec equal to 5 .",
    "in this way , for @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 . for @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the magnitude of the interaction between the pec is studied as a function of the dimensionless parameter @xmath76 , the distance between the pec , @xmath64 , the angular noise intensity @xmath14 and the area fraction @xmath77 , with the later defined as @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the number of spp , @xmath80 is the size of the 2d squared simulation box and @xmath81 is the total area occupied by the pec .",
    "note that @xmath77 is related to the density @xmath82 of spp , i.e. @xmath83 , where @xmath82 is the spp density .",

( 6 ) and ( b ) depletion force calculated from the compression of a single particle due to the right pec . ]      in this section we analyse the influence of the shape and orientation of the pec on the depletion interaction in the active bath . for this , we study how @xmath65 depends on the separation @xmath64 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] ) between the pec along the @xmath38-axis .",
    "the shape and orientation of the pec are controlled by the parameter @xmath76 which is considered in the interval @xmath96 .",
    "the other relevant parameters of the model , namely , the area fraction and noise intensity are kept constant as @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively .",
    "the average force @xmath65 on the left pec as a function of @xmath64 for different values of @xmath76 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "@xmath65 exhibits negative values for any @xmath76 , indicating that the left pec is pushed away from the right pec .",
    "the explanation for this behavior consists of two arguments , based on what we observed in our simulations : the first one is based on the aggregation of the spps in between the pec ( which is the main reason for the repulsive character of this force ) ; as a consequence of the fact that the spps do not collide in the usual sense , but stick to surfaces upon contact .",
    "the second argument is stated mainly to explain the general shape of the curves seen in fig .",
    "2 . therefore , the effective interaction between the pec is repulsive , which is opposite to the result obtained by asakura and oosawa@xcite for a bath of passive particles .",
    "recently , ni @xmath97 showed that the repulsive interaction is not the only one observed in a 2d bath of active particles .",
    "in the low density case , it was observed a long - range attraction between parallel hard - wall plates @xcite .",
    "similar results were also obtained by d. ray _",
    "et al _ @xcite but there they found regimes in which there is a crossover from attraction to repulsion between the walls as a function of wall separation and wall length and by stenhammar _",
    "et al _ @xcite , where it was found that in a mixture of active and passive particles motility of the active component triggers active - passive segregation , which illustrates the attraction between passive particles .",
    "for @xmath98 the magnitude of @xmath65 increases monotonically with increasing @xmath64 in both cases @xmath69 and @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath65 drops considerably as the separation between the obstacles approach the diameter of a single spp .",
    "this happens because the spp becomes able to pass between the obstacles , reducing drastically the pressure on them .",
    "it is also interesting to observe that the depletion forces on horizontal pecs are one order of magnitude higher than those on vertical pecs .    in order to complement and have a better undestanding of the previous results , the reduced area fraction distribution for @xmath99 and @xmath95",
    "is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "the concentration of spp is larger in the region between the pec compared to the agregation around them .",
    "this creates an unbalance on the spp concentration between pec such that induces forces on both pec in opposite directions .",
    "in addition , the concentrations of spp in cases with @xmath69 are larger than the ones found in cases with @xmath68 .",
    "this is one of the reasons for the difference in magnitude of @xmath100 as a function of @xmath76 observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "in addition , the closer the spp are from the line joining the center of the pec , the more intense is the _",
    "x_-component of the depletion force . figs .",
    "[ fig : fig3](a ) , ( d ) , ( g ) , and ( j ) indicate that the accumulation of spp around the vertical pec is higher in the region around @xmath101 , @xmath102 , while from figs .",
    "[ fig : fig3](c ) , ( f ) , ( i ) , and ( l ) the aggregation of spp around horizontal pec is higher around the point @xmath101 , @xmath103 .",
    "therefore , the distribution of spp around the pec indicates that the force exerted by the spp on vertical pec , is smaller than that exerted on horizontal pec .    regarding the dependence of @xmath100 on the separation @xmath64 between the pec ( fig .",
    "1 ) , we may understand this result qualitatively as follows .",
    "when the pec are at @xmath104 , a single particle ( we consider it to have very low rotational noise ) can fit through them with no overlap , and hence the force is zero .",
    "when @xmath105 , a particle may still pass between them , but with some overlap ( due to the soft - core elastic interaction ) . therefore , the repulsive force should increase .",
    "this will occur up to a point in which the maximum compression balance the intrinsic force of the spp , and it gets trapped in between the obstacles . as we lower @xmath64 , the horizontal ( @xmath38-axis ) projection of the trapping force decreases , for the spp will be trapped at a point further away in @xmath45 from the line joining the pecs ; therefore , we should expect a lower repulsion for closer @xmath64 .",
    "the active particles get trapped in a similar mechanism as found by kaiser _",
    "et al _ @xcite . in our case ,",
    "vertical pec , because of the more narrow inner space ( compared to that of horizontal pec ) , accumulates fewer particles than horizontal pec , which has a larger inner space .",
    "moreover remember that we considered very low rotational noise ( @xmath90 ) and its variation would only change the magnitude of the force ( as detailed in sect .",
    "[ subsect : noise ] ) , but not its general dependence on @xmath64 .",
    "quantitatively , we can frame this discussion by considering a circular pec ( @xmath106 ) , in which an active particle moves in the direction perpendicular to the line joining the obstacles and through the middle point of such line .",
    "when it is compressed by the pec , it experiences a force with a magnitude of @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the circular pec diameter and @xmath109 is the spp - pec distance .",
    "the vertical force on the active particle due to the compression with the pec is @xmath110 , and , in general , we have @xmath111 .",
    "when the equality holds , the particle gets trapped in between the pec .",
    "hence , we can calculate the @xmath42 in which this will occur , for a definite @xmath64 , by solving the following equation :    @xmath112    the repulsive force in each pec due to this passage of the small particle is simply @xmath113 ; then , by calculating @xmath45 , and @xmath114 , we can calculate @xmath115 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] we present this force and the corresponding solution to eq .",
    "[ eq : analytic ] , with the parameters used in our simulations .",
    "note that for @xmath116 , there is no curve because the particle is able to cross the line joining the pec , resulting that there is no solution to eq .",
    "[ eq : analytic ] .",
    "the curve we obtained has the the features of those seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , it has a minimum ( maximum force ) and decreases up to the point in which the pec touch each other , and the behavior with @xmath64 is non - linear .",
    "the depletion force evaluated above is lower , compared to the numerical results , by , approximately , one order of magnitude .    these differences between our simulation results and",
    "the single particle compression argument we drew are due to the aggregates between the obstacles .",
    "this phenomenon will clearly increase the depletion force because more particles will interact with the pec .    to make sure the results found in fig .",
    "2 are induced by the active behaviour of the spp , we made simulations switching off the self - propulsion with non - zero translational noise ( results not shown ) .",
    "the expected atractive interaction between the colloids in a bath of passive particles is indeed observed for @xmath117 and @xmath118 . on the other hand , for @xmath119",
    "the depletion force was found to be repulsive , contrary to the well known result of asakura - oosawa .",
    "the magnitude of this repulsive force is of the order of those we show in fig .",
    "2(b ) ( @xmath120 for a thermal noise intersity of 100 ) .",
    "we leave the investigation of this result for future work .",
    "recent studies have shown that the noise intensity plays an important role in active matter systems @xcite .",
    "therefore it is interesting to consider its influence on the depletion interaction in the present model .",
    "we study the noise dependence of @xmath65 for @xmath92 ( horizontal ellipse ) , @xmath106 ( circle ) and @xmath121 ( vertical ellipse ) .",
    "the area fraction is @xmath89 .",
    "the pec are placed in contact with each other , i.e. , @xmath122 .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] . in general",
    ", the repulsive force vanishes for a large enough noise intensity .",
    "as shown previously @xcite , the dynamics of ssp around rigid obstacles is based on the sliding of the particles over the pec surface .",
    "large noise intensity results in large fluctuations in the direction of the spp velocity which allows the spp to leave the pec surface , reducing the pressure , and consequently , reducing the repulsive depletion force between the pec .",
    "+ we also found that with decreasing @xmath14 , the magnitude of the force increases much faster for @xmath119 than in the other two cases .",
    "this is a consequence of the mechanism explained in the sect .",
    "[ subsect : shape ] . by decreasing the noise intensity",
    "large clusters are allowed to form , and these clusters contribute more to the repulsive force in the horizontal case .     as a function of the noise , @xmath14 for @xmath89 .",

    "the depletion force is repulsive for low @xmath77 , and becomes attractive for @xmath127 .",

    "horizontal ( along the x - axis ) and vertical ( along the y - axis ) pec are characterized by @xmath88 and @xmath87 , respectively . in general , the depletion force observed on horizontal pec is one order of magnitude larger than that observed on vertical pec , due to the particular sliding dynamics of active particles in rigid surfaces .",
    "we argued that the difference in value of @xmath133 observed for distinct @xmath76 is due to the larger aggregation ( the mechanism responsible for repulsion ) in between the horizontal pec as well as the larger horizontal projection of the compressive force between the spp and pec for @xmath146 .",
    "with respect to the separation between the pec , as the pec get further away from each other , the magnitude of the depletion force increases until the distance reaches @xmath147 , where the force drops sharply , and almost reaches zero .",
    "such a behavior was observed independently of @xmath76 .",
    "noise strength has a significant influence on depletion forces , once for the cases studied ( circular , vertical and horizontal elliptical objects ) the higher the angular noise , the lower the magnitude of the depletion forces .",
    "this happens because the clusters around the pec decrease in size as angular noise raises . by increasing the concentration of active particles ( area fraction )",
    "we show that it is possible to achieve attractive forces between the pec for @xmath148 .",
    "high values of the area fraction allow the spp to coalesce on the outer side of the obstacles , and contribute to lowering the repulsive depletion force .",
    "in particular , for @xmath121 ( vertical pec ) and @xmath127 , the spp decrease their presence in the region between the pec at the same time that they attach to the outer side of the pec such that the net force becomes attractive . for separation between the pec @xmath149 , the depletion forces decreases with increasing @xmath64 but with distinct rates , which depend on the shape of the pec .",
    "e. g. , for @xmath150 and @xmath119 ( horizontal pec ) , a considerable agglomeration of spp is still found between the pec resulting in a non - vanishing repulsive force , distinctly from the cases @xmath151 ( circles ) and @xmath152 ( vertical pec ) , where @xmath153 . finally , we studied the depletion force when one horizontal pec is close to a vertical pec in a bath of active particles .",
    "the depletion force is repulsive , but with an intermediate magnitude compared to those observed in the cases with two horizontal or two vertical pec .",
    "this work was supported by the brazilian agencies cnpq , capes , funcap and fapespa .",
    "the contact spp - pec can be modelled as follows : in order to write the overlap , @xmath154 , as a function of spp coordinates , we consider that spp interacts with a new pec ( pec ) such that its semi - axis are @xmath155 bigger than the original one .",
    "so @xmath156 , where @xmath157 for horizontal pec and @xmath158 for vertical pec. apostrophe ( @xmath159 ) means the pec variables . equation for @xmath160 and @xmath161 can be written as @xmath162 @xmath163      supposing , at first , a horizontal pec placed on x - axis , it is important to note that , in this case : + ( i ) ellipse focus coordinates are @xmath167 and @xmath168 ( focus 1 and 2 , respectively ) , where @xmath169 is the excentricity of pec + ( ii ) @xmath170 , then @xmath171 and @xmath172 and + ( iii ) @xmath173 and @xmath174 , so that equations ( 7 ) and ( 8) can be rewritten as @xmath175 @xmath176      sriram ramaswamy , annual review of condensed matter physics 1 , 323 ( 2010 ) .",
