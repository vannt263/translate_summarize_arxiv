    "galaxy formation is undoubtedly one of the desiderata in modern astrophysics , but remains a long - standing unsolved problem .",
    "the quest for ` primeval galaxies ' is still a strong motivation of deep surveys by large telescopes and future space missions . by now",
    ", much effort has gone into the search for galaxies at high redshift ( @xmath6 ) , some of which we believe are experiencing their first episode of star formation : lyman break objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; lyman @xmath7 emitters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; submillimetre galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; hyper - extremely red objects ( heros ) which are also thought to be strongly enshrouded by dust ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ".    however , these objects have already produced significant amount of stars , and consequently , are chemically enriched by heavy elements .",
    "galaxies are thought to be extremely metal - poor just after their birth , hence they may have had only a small amount of dust . even in lyman break",
    "galaxies however , there is clear evidence that they contain non - negligible amount of dust ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it remains difficult to explore the physics of metal - deficient first objects in the early universe because of our observational limitations .    among related issues , the extent to which very early star formation has been hidden by dust is one of the most interesting themes .",
    "little doubt remains about the importance of extinction properties to evaluate high-@xmath6 star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "dust grains absorb stellar light and re - emit it in the far infrared ( fir ) .",
    "indeed , the fir spectral range represents a unique opportunity to study the dust properties and distribution , and several dedicated infrared ( ir ) space or stratospheric missions are planned ( _ astro - f _ , _ sirtf _ , sofia , _ herschel space observatory _ , etc . ) .",
    "furthermore , how dust forms and evolves in primeval galaxies needs to be considered in order to understand the chemical and thermodynamical evolution of a metal - poor interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "dust grains drastically accelerate the formation rate of molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath8 ) , expected to be the most abundant molecule in the ism ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "hydrogen molecules emit vibrational - rotational lines .",
    "it is the only coolant in a cool ( temperature @xmath9  k ) dense core of metal - deficient system , since the atomic cooling does not work effectively .",
    "hence , the cooling rate of a primeval galaxy consequently depends strongly on the dust content and h@xmath8 abundance .",
    "recently ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter h02 ) have developed a model for the evolution of dust content in very young ( or primeval ) galaxies .",
    "dust is expected to be produced at the final stages of stellar evolution , and type ii supernovae ( sne ii ) are the dominant source for the production of dust grains in young star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "dust formation in stellar winds from evolved low - mass stars like red giant branch stars ( rgbs ) or asymptotic giant branch stars ( agbs ) can also contribute considerably , but the cosmic time is not long enough for such stars to evolve at high-@xmath6 .",
    "on the other hand , dust is also destroyed by sn shocks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; however , h02 have shown that the dust destruction is negligible compared to the formation rate in young ( @xmath10  yr ) galaxies .",
    "then they have modeled the evolution of fir luminosity and dust temperature in such a young starburst on the basis of sne ii grain formation model of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* tf01 ) .",
    "while high-@xmath6 primeval galaxies are still beyond the ability of present experiments , starbursts in the local universe are often assumed to be good representatives of the star forming activity at high redshifts . as such",
    ", they are cosmologically interesting as key laboratories for studying the ism , the transport of supernova processed metals , and the chemical evolution of galaxies and of the intergalactic medium @xcite . h02",
    "have paid especial attention to the nearby , extremely low - metallicity galaxy , since this object may be truly experiencing its first burst of star formation ( @xmath11 yr ; @xcite ) .",
    "the models by h02 successfully explain its observed properties such as dust mass and temperature , and far infrared ( fir ) luminosity .    in this paper , we further investigate the ir properties of very young galaxies , and construct a simple model of mid- to far - infrared ( mir and fir ) seds of galaxies starting from the h02 models .",
    "as already mentioned above , sne ii are expected to dominate the dust formation in very young galaxies .",
    "the size of dust grains formed in sne ii can not be as large as @xmath12 m ( tf01 ) , and host galaxies are too young for grains to grow in the interstellar space .",
    "tf01 have shown that the size distribution of grains produced by sn ii is well approximated to be single - sized .",
    "a narrow size distribution favoring small grain sizes makes the appearance of ir spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of young galaxies drastically different from that of nearby aged galaxies .",
    "we , for the first time , properly consider the dust size distribution peculiar to the very early stage of galaxy evolution , and construct a model of the ir sed of very young galaxies .",
    "then , we compare our models to the observations in , and continue the discussion by h02 on evolution of dust content .    in order to discuss the effects of dust in such galaxies , we must first discuss the effect of dust sublimation .",
    "dust grains are expected to sublime in hii regions because of the strong radiation from the central source ( in this case , ob stars ) .",
    "indeed , the small - sized carbon grains ( or pahs ) are deficient in a strong ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation environment ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the radius of the dust cavity caused by the sublimation is much smaller than that of the star forming region for classical size grains ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "further , as will be seen later , although our model dust grains are smaller than the classical grains , the sublimation process is governed by the energy of each injecting photon , because of the small grain cross section . for small grains , the peak temperature can not reach the sublimation temperature .",
    "hence we can safely neglect the effects of sublimation in our discussion .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we first model the dust content of a young galaxy whose age is less than @xmath13 yr in ",
    "[ sec : model ] .",
    "we show the evolution of the seds of young galaxies and their ir extinction curve in  [ sec : results ] .",
    "then , we discuss some topics related to the infrared properties of young galaxies in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we finally compare the model predictions with the observed quantities of the extremely low - metallicity bcd , , in ",
    "[ subsec : sbssed ] .",
    "the lowest metallicity star - forming galaxy ever known ,   ( @xmath14 ) , is another representative of the star forming dwarfs .",
    "we present a prediction for the sed of  in  [ subsec : izwsed ] .",
    "based on these investigations , we estimate how many low - metallicity dwarf galaxies and blue compact dwarfs will be detected in future observational projects in  [ subsec : future ] . the last section (   [ sec : conclusion ] ) is devoted to our conclusions .",
    "first we briefly describe the star formation and dust production model proposed by h02 .",
    "this model treats the evolution of dust content in a young galaxy whose age is less than @xmath13  yr .",
    "hence dust formation in stellar winds from evolved low - mass stars like rgbs or agbs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is negligible because the time interval is too short for stars to evolve to such stages .",
    "we can therefore safely assume that only sn ii contributes to the dust formation . for similar reasons ,",
    "the contribution of type ia supernovae to the total supernova rate can be also neglected .",
    "further , since dust destruction by sne may be important on a longer timescale of @xmath15  yr @xcite , we can also safely neglect this process .",
    "therefore , the only contributor to the total dust mass ( @xmath16 ) in a young ( @xmath17  yr ) galaxy is the supply from sne ii .    the rate of sne ii is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the star formation rate ( sfr ) at age @xmath20 ( we define @xmath21 at the beginning of the star formation ) , @xmath22 is the initial mass function ( imf ) , @xmath23 is the lifetime of a star whose mass is @xmath24 , and it is assumed that only stars with @xmath25 produce sne ii .",
    "h02 assume a constant sfr , @xmath26 , and a salpeter imf ( @xmath27 ; the mass range of stars is 0.160 @xmath28 ) to obtain a first estimate ) for the stellar imf , because tf01 only give dust production rate for stars @xmath29 .",
    "though some assume that the upper mass bound @xmath30 , our framework is insensitive to the upper stellar cut - off , because the number of such high - mass ( @xmath31 ) stars is extremely small .",
    "the contribution of the high - mass stars to uv luminosity is also much smaller than that of the intermediate ( @xmath32 ) mass stars if the stellar luminosity is weighted with the salpeter imf . in summary",
    ", the upper mass limit does not significantly affect our conclusions . ] .",
    "then the rate of increase of @xmath16 is written as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the typical dust mass produced in a sn ii .",
    "we adopt @xmath35 ( hf02 ) .",
    "we start the calculation from @xmath36 at @xmath21 .",
    "because dust production rate is proportional to @xmath37 which is proportional to the sfr @xmath38 , @xmath16 calculated by our model directly scales as @xmath38 .",
    "the dust mass evolution with @xmath39 is shown in figure  1 of h02 .      in this subsection",
    ", we present the construction of the seds for very young galaxies .",
    "as already discussed above , in their early phase , sn ii explosions dominate the supply of dust .",
    "the galaxies considered here are too young to have evolved low - mass stars like rgbs or agbs .",
    "these evolved low - mass stars are considered to be the source of large - size grains with a power - law like size distribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it should also be noted that they are too young to make small grains grow larger in their diffuse interstellar medium ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we recall that dust grains are schematically divided into silicate and carbonaceous ones ; only these two species are considered in this work . tf01",
    "have shown that the sizes of silicate and carbonaceous grains formed in sn ii ejecta to be about 10    and 300   , respectively .",
    "then the overall size distribution of dust is well represented by a superposition of two delta functions , which correspond to the sizes of silicate and carbonaceous grains .",
    "tf01 estimated the uncertainty of the grain sizes to be a factor of @xmath40 within a reasonable range of the relevant thermodynamical parameters .",
    "other sources of uncertainty and their estimates are discussed in tf01 . here",
    "we should keep in mind the lack of large - size grains of @xmath41 m in very young galaxies , while a substantial contribution of such large ` classical ' grains is inferred from the observation of the galactic diffuse ir emission or the ir seds of nearby galaxies .",
    "the discrete and small grain sizes make the appearance of the sed of young galaxies drastically different from that of aged normal galaxies , especially in the ir .",
    "we next focus on the most important radiation process of small dust grains .",
    "the dust grains originating from sne ii can not be as large as those formed in the atmosphere of evolved agb stars or grown in the diffuse interstellar space ( @xcite ; tf01 ) .",
    "tf01 clearly showed that the sizes of the silicate grains and of the carbonaceous grains are much smaller than that of classical large grains .    here",
    "we note that tf01 used the classical nucleation theory for the formulation of mass accretion onto grains @xcite .",
    "these grain sizes might be even smaller if we use a more recent formation theory of dust grains from metal - rich gas medium ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . this revision may introduce many subtle and perplexing effects in the dust formation process , and further investigations are awaited ( cf . * ? ? ? * ) . the effect of dust size",
    "will be addressed later in the context of the origin of near - infrared ( nir ) continuum radiation .",
    "it is well accepted that very small grains are ` stochastically heated ' , that is they can not establish thermal equilibrium with the ambient radiation field ( @xcite ( dl01 ) ) : the heat capacity of very small grains is too small to maintain its temperature until the next photon impinges .",
    "hence , the equilibrium temperature of a grain can not be well defined because its ` temperature ' varies violently with time , i.e. , it becomes very hot each time a uv photon is absorbed by the grain , and subsequently cools rapidly to a very low temperature .",
    "consequently , the continuum shape from very small grains becomes much wider than that of a modified blackbody , and the continuum has a strong extension to the nir .",
    "we adopt this picture and use it to calculate the dust emission in the nir  mir .",
    "now we formulate the stochastic heating of very small dust grains .",
    "the heat capacity of a grain has been extensively studied and modeled by previous papers ( dl01 ; ( * ? ? ? * and reference therein ) ) .",
    "we apply the multidimensional debye model for the heat capacity of a grain , @xmath42 , as introduced by dl01 . the specific heat of silicate grains is represented by @xmath43,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and that of carbonaceous grains is @xmath44,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the boltzmann s constant ( the subscripts ` sil ' and ` c ' represent the silicate and carbonaceous grains , respectively ) .",
    "namely , as for silicate grains , two - thirds of the vibrational modes are distributed according to a debye model with @xmath47 and debye temperature @xmath48  k , and one - third of the modes are described by a debye model with @xmath49 and @xmath50  k. for carbonaceous grains @xmath51 out - of - plane modes and @xmath52 in - plane modes are set .",

    "if the dust opacity is very large , then self - absorption occurs , and even mir radiation from dust is absorbed by the dust itself . in this work",
    "we did not try to solve the detailed radiative transfer but rather treat the extinction as given by a one - zone screen model .",
    "the resulting extinction curve is different from that of @xcite because of the different dust size distribution . in this case dust opacity and extinction",

    "we set the silicate dust grain size to @xmath122    and @xmath123  ( solid and dotted lines , respectively ) , because grain size can be changed by a factor of about two depending on the conditions of grain formation .",

    "heated grain extends toward nir wavelengths .",
    "this effect is quite sensitive to the grain size of @xmath126 , in our case that of silicate grains .",
    "in contrast , the so - called ` very small grains ( vsgs ) ' in the local normal ( viz .  solar metal abundance ) star forming galaxies are generally thought to consist of carbonaceous grains or their fragments . in the early , optically thin phase of a young galaxy ,",
    "these small silicate grains produce a prominent band feature around @xmath127 m in emission .",
    "it is worth mentioning that even in the extremely intense radiation field of @xmath128 , such a small grain can not establish thermal equilibrium with the ambient radiation , because the cooling time of a grain ( typically @xmath129  s at @xmath130  k ) is much shorter than the mean interval of photon injection onto the grain ( @xmath131s ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that the absence of unidentified infrared band ( uib ) features in the intense uv environment of  implies that stochastically heated small grains are unimportant in such galaxies .",
    "however , as we have explained , small silicate grains considered here may be uncorrelated with uibs .",
    "small silicate grain is naturally expected in sne ( tf01 ) , so we should properly take into account the effect of stochastic heating of small grains in starburst systems . indeed , until the extinction becomes significant , their contribution is dominant in n ",
    "mir wavelengths in our results .",
    "we also stress that the dust temperature of carbonaceous grains is very high , @xmath132  k in the early phase . because of the lack of classical size ( @xmath133 m ) large grains , submillimetre continuum radiation is weak , and the peaks are located around the mir during the first a few tens of myrs .",
    "such a high dust temperature is also predicted for giant forming ellipticals by @xcite .",
    "after the early phase characterized by the radiation from hot dust ( @xmath134  yr ) , opacity of dust becomes large , and consequently self absorption of dust gets quickly severe in the n  mir regime . finally , the observed dust temperature decreases to 50  k or less .",
    "in particular , the @xmath127 m silicate band causes a prominent absorption feature even for a young age @xmath135  yr .",
    "the absorbed light is then re - emitted in the fir - submm wavelengths , which results in a cooler effective temperature .",
    "consequently , the temperature history is consistent with that of h02 which was derived simply from energy considerations .",
    "we show the evolution of the ir extinction curves for the cases @xmath136  pc and 100  pc in figure  [ fig : irextinction ] .",
    "we should note that , since dust is supplied only from sne ii ( i.e. , the dust size distribution does not vary ) within the timescale considered here , shape of the extinction curve does not change in time .",

    "hence , results are the same for @xmath141    and 10   .    here",
    "we should keep in mind that the large opacity makes radiation pressure effective @xcite , and may cause the expansion of the star - forming complex and eventually , the onset of galactic wind at some stage in the galaxy evolution .",

    ", this is consistent with a small silicate grain size @xmath158   .",
    "further , the mir peak and lack of a prominent submillimetre component strongly support the absence of classical - size large grains .",

    "@xcite also reached to a similar conclusion for the lack of classical size grains from a different radiative transfer model .",

    "this aspect will be discussed in ",
    "[ subsubsec : extinction ] .    as we mentioned in ",
    "[ subsubsec : emission ] , the configuration of dust may be shell - like within a timescale of @xmath162yr .",

    ", we have succeeded in reproducing the overall sed of  with the starburst age @xmath163  myr .",
    "thus , all the peculiar properties of  are consistent with those of a genuine young galaxy in the local universe .",
    "this success strongly supports the validity of our model , despite its simplicity .",
    "myr ( solid line ) .",
    "the @xcite extinction curve , scaled to @xmath164  mag @xcite is also shown ( dashed line ) .",
    "open symbols represent the extinction deduced semi - empirically from the ` bare ' model sed and the observed data : squares are the semi - empirical extinction curve derived from the photometry , and triangles are from the isocam spectrum . ,",
    "width=340 ]      @xcite have shown that the extinction properties of can be well described by the extinction curve of @xcite , advocated for the extinction of the galactic centre ( gc ) , assuming a simplifying assumption of screen - like dust geometry . in their evaluation of extinction ,",
    "hunt et al .  assumed a superposition of two modified blackbodies for the continuum radiation , only the cooler of which was extinguished by the screen . @xcite and @xcite also assumed modified blackbody for the unextincted continuum to explore the properties of the ir radiation of this galaxy .",
    "however , as we have already seen in the previous section , we can not expect equilibrium between the uv radiation field and very small dust grains , which are thought to be the main source of the continuum radiation in the n  mir .",
    "this is also pointed out by @xcite .",
    "bearing this in mind , here we reconsider the ir extinction properties .",
    "the ir extinction curve predicted by our model is presented in figure  [ fig : extinction ] .",
    "this curve is the one of a galaxy with the same parameters used in figure  [ fig : sbs ] .",
    "first , it is roughly consistent with the @xcite extinction curve , scaled by a visual extinction @xmath165  mag @xcite .",
    "indeed , the gc curve is quantitatively well reproduced by our model with @xmath166 , the star forming region size @xmath167  pc , and the above starburst age .",
    "since our model provides the extinction curve only at wavelengths @xmath168 m , if we extrapolate the model extinction of @xmath169-band to @xmath170-band by the ratio tabulated in @xcite , we obtain the visual extinction strength @xmath171  mag .",
    "it is also equal to the value calculated by the relation @xmath172 @xcite .",
    "this value is in good agreement with the estimate of hunt et al . , although lower than the value @xmath173mag by @xcite .",
    "this may be caused by the difference of the radiation models used for calculation .",
    "here we should keep in mind that the @xmath174 measured at the optically visible region of  is small ( @xmath175  mag ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , typical of dwarf irregulars .",
    "so , the peculiar characteristics of  may be governed by the heavily embedded star - forming region .",
    "though the model extinction curve is roughly consistent with the gc one in the nir regime , our model predicts a flatter slope than the gc one in the extrapolation to the optical .",
    "our extinction curve in the nir regime has a slope similar to @xcite ( @xmath176 ) .",
    "@xcite found that the extrapolation of lutz s gc curve to the optical by the slope of @xmath177 , close to that of @xcite ( see the extension of the dashed line to the optical in figure  [ fig : extinction ] ) .",
    "the flatter slope of our extinction curve is a natural consequence of the fact that the continuum radiation is not produced from the dust in equilibrium with ambient uv field .",
    "the shape of the non - equilibrium continuum is much broader than that of modified blackbody radiation .",
    "the intensity of our continuum radiation in the n ",
    "mir is stronger than that of the modified blackbody if we fix the intensity at about @xmath178 m , hence , we need a stronger extinction ( flatter slope ) at n  mir wavelength range . the stronger extinction at the @xmath127 m broad silicate feature is also explained in a similar way .",
    "such behaviour is required to reproduce the absorption feature in the observed sed of .    in order to examine these issues in more detail",
    ", we estimated the extinction with our ` bare ' model sed , calculated without taking into account the self - absorption , rather than using the modified blackbody continuum .",
    "the deduced extinction is represented by open squares and triangles in figure  [ fig : extinction ] .",
    "we call the newly derived extinction the ` semi - empirical extinction curve ' . unfortunately , since the nir fluxes from dust emission contain a large uncertainty depending on the nebular and stellar contribution , we can not strongly constrain the shape of the curve , but the nir part of our model extinction curve shows rough agreement with the semi - empirical estimates . around the @xmath127 m silicate feature ,",
    "the model extinction curve shows very good agreement with the semi - empirical one .",
    "this result vindicates the performance of our model , as well as the simplifying assumption of a screen - like dust geometry .",
    "however , around the @xmath179 m silicate feature , our model significantly underestimates the extinction .",
    "correspondingly , our model sed overproduces the flux around @xmath178 m , compared with the observation of plante & sauvage ( figure  [ fig : sbs ] ) . many ir galaxies show the strong absorption feature at @xmath179 m ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the discrepancy stems from the shape of the extinction curve around @xmath178 m .",
    "we can not reproduce such a feature within our present framework based on the dust emissivity of @xcite .",
    "this riddle will be investigated in future work .    except the above discrepancy",
    ", our model extinction curve naturally explains most important properties of the gc curve of @xcite .",
    "the success of our model in reproducing the extinction curve strongly supports the composition of dust supplied by sne ii as predicted by tf01 .",
    "has long been a record holder as the lowest metallicity star - forming galaxy in the local universe ( @xmath180 ) , as well as a textbook example of a dwarf starburst .",
    "hence , in the context of our model , it is an intriguing object to discuss as another representative of extremely low - metallicity galaxies .",
    "@xcite estimated its distance to be 12.6  mpc , and we use this value for our discussion . whether  is really a newly formed system or not has been a matter of debate .",
    "the discovery of agb stars @xcite may suggest an underlying old population , but its contribution is almost certainly not dominant @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we therefore regard  as a forming galaxy for the first approximation .",
    "recently , from hst wfpc2 narrowband imaging , @xcite derived various important physical properties of this galaxy .",
    "they showed that the o8 ionizing equivalent number of this galaxy is 2886 for the total galaxy .",
    "it corresponds to a total ob star luminosity , @xmath181 . from the h@xmath7 image , we estimate the total size of the sf regions of @xmath182  pc .",
    "the sfr of  is @xmath183 , and for some patches , @xmath184  mag @xcite .",
    "we use these values to constrain the model prediction .    from the measured extinction ,",
    "may also contain a significant amount of dust .",
    "@xcite estimated the total dust mass @xmath185 .",
    "this value is consistent with the dust - to - gas ratio expected from the metallicity @xcite .",
    "the dust mass of our model reaches this value at the starburst age @xmath186  yr , an age consistent with the observationally suggested major sf age in  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ", we note that a smaller size of the sf region makes @xmath174 exceed 0.5  mag and is not permitted .",
    "we show the resulting sed in figure  [ fig : izw ] .",
    "the photometric data in the nir are taken from @xcite .",
    "for the case of , interstellar conditions are quite different from those in , in spite of their similar metallicities .",
    "since the visual extinction @xmath174 is very low even in its star forming patches , the radiation reprocessing from uv to fir is inefficient .",
    "it naturally leads to a low ir luminosity @xmath187 .",
    "for the same reason , the silicate band features are observed in emission in the sed of .",
    "it is worthwhile to focus on the differences between  and .",
    "indeed , these two representative low - metallicity star - forming dwarfs are significantly different in spite of their almost same metallicities .",
    "first , the sfr of  is much smaller than that of .",
    "this means that the dust production rate of  is much smaller than that of . in spite of their optical similarity ,",
    "has rather normal sfr while  has extremely vigorous star formation .",
    "such an active / passive star formation variety may play an important role in understanding their activity @xcite .",
    "second , the apparent sf region size of  is much larger than that of .",
    "this difference could be produced by the dust sweeping by the radiation pressure from the central stellar cluster .",
    "when the age of the system becomes older , the dust layer may be swept far away from the star - forming complex , and the opacity may get smaller .",
    "since  has an older age than , the dust layer of the can be transported further away .",
    "the small dust opacity of  might be understood by the combination of the above two effects .",
    "inspection of figure  [ fig : izw ] tells us that the peak of the sed of  is located around @xmath147 m both in the most optimistic and pessimistic predictions",
    ". however , the detection in these wavelengths is limited by galactic cirrus . a shorter wavelength ( @xmath188 m ) observation will be dramatically easier .",
    "the mir observation from space seems exciting , and crucial to examine the validity of our prediction . in the nir ,",
    "dust contribution may be negligible in the nir .",
    "the fraction of dust emission appears to be smaller than that of .",
    "this suggests that either of stellar and nebular contribution is dominant in the nir .",
    "we discuss the possibility and prospects for future observation in the next subsection .",
    "as we have seen in the above , even in the intense uv radiation field of very young galaxies , small silicate grains suffer from stochastic heating and consequently have a broad temperature distribution .",
    "hence , silicate grains mainly contribute to the mir continuum emission .",
    "carbonaceous grains have larger sizes and can be in thermal equilibrium , but the strong uv field makes their equilibrium temperature very high ( @xmath189  k ) , and they also contribute to the mir .",
    "these facts indicate that both ( restframe ) mir and fir surveys are necessary to examine the dust amount of galaxies over wide range of metallicity .",
    "our models show that the observed flux of  is expected to be @xmath190mjy at @xmath147 m .",
    "this agrees very well with a simple argument by @xcite , who showed that the expected flux for  is 7100 mjy at @xmath147 m .",
    "typical detection limits for the forthcoming fir surveys are @xmath191mjy at @xmath192 m and @xmath193mjy at @xmath194 m . we expect @xmath195 detections of such local low metallicity galaxies by some space observations in the near future such as the _ sirtf _  swire legacy program and _ astro - f _",
    "fir all - sky survey , if we assume the local luminosity functions for star - forming dwarf galaxies",
    ". however we should be aware of the cirrus confusion limit , which makes it difficult to detect ir extragalactic sources at wavelengths @xmath196 m . in order to detect these galaxies at @xmath197 m , a large aperture ( @xmath198 m ) fir space telescope like _ herschel _",
    "is required to obtain a small diffraction limit to overcome the cirrus confusion limits .",
    "_ herschel space observatory _ will be one of the optimal instruments for this purpose ( on the estimation of the fir confusion limit for various forthcoming instruments , see e.g. , @xcite ) . in any case",
    ", such a sample will be useful for the systematic studies on ` primeval galaxies ' , through the investigation of other possibly ` young ' local dwarfs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , our result for hot dust also offers a potentially important cosmological insight into high-@xmath6 galaxies : if dust in high-@xmath6 object is as cool as usually assumed , then we can not expect a high comoving sfr density because in a realistic cosmology the cosmic ir background ( cirb ) spectrum strongly constrains the high-@xmath6 ir emission @xcite",
    ". however , very hot dust in such high-@xmath6 object reconciles the cirb constraint with high sfr , and allows vigorous star formation hidden by dust in the early universe @xcite .",
    "some studies attempt to predict the number of submillimetre galaxies at high-@xmath6 ( @xmath199 ) from both empirical and theoretical viewpoints ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "most models assume galaxy seds similar to those of local dusty giant starbursts like m82 or arp 220 . however , we advocate our theoretical framework for very young galaxies to make it possible to treat dwarf starbursts , because present galaxy formation models suggest a vast number of dwarf galaxies in the early universe .",
    "@xcite provided a comprehensive framework of very high-@xmath6 ( or , say , primeval : @xmath200 ) dwarfs in the submillimetre and millimetre , and showed the alma detectability .",
    "they also suggest the existence of dust warmer than the typical galactic environment because of the intense radiation field .",
    "this emphasizes the importance of our sed modeling which is applicable to young galaxies with intense interstellar radiation fields . with our sed modeling ,",
    "thus , the advent of alma will enable us to compare our models with observations of such low mass , _ bona fide _ primeval galaxies .",
    "we have constructed a simple model of mid- to far - infrared ( mir and fir ) seds of galaxies to investigate the ir properties of very young galaxies , based on the galaxy evolution model of ( * ? ? ? * h02 ) .",
    "small grains can not establish thermal equilibrium with the ambient radiation field because of their very small heat capacity .",
    "we find that , even in the intense uv radiation field of very young galaxies , small silicate grains still can not be in equilibrium , and consequently have a broad temperature distribution .",
    "hence , silicate grains contribute mainly to the mir continuum emission .",
    "carbonaceous grains are larger and can be in thermal equilibrium , but the strong uv field makes their equilibrium temperature very high ( @xmath189  k ) ; hence they also contribute to the mir .",
    "we calculated the seds of very young , low - metallicity galaxies as a function of starburst age .",
    "in the first several myrs , such a galaxy shows very hot dust emission with a peak at @xmath1 m , because the self absorption is not very pronounced in this phase .",
    "later , the sed changes its appearance to a more common shape , dominated by cooler dust emission , caused by the strong self - absorption of mir light and re - emission at submillimetre wavelengths . the evolution of the dust opacity and the shape of the ir extinction curve were also given .",
    "we succeeded in reproducing the mir ",

    "we also successfully reproduced the extinction curve of , which agrees well with the semi - empirical extinction curve deduced from the observational data and our unextincted ` bare ' continuum sed .",
    "we obtain the visual extinction strength @xmath203mag , consistently with hunt et al.s estimate of @xmath204mag .    for future observations",
    ", we then made a prediction for the sed of another extremely low - metallicity galaxy , .",
    "as in the case of the optically visible part of ,  has a low visual extinction , which suggests a small dust opacity .",
    "hence it follows that the fir luminosity of  is probably low as @xmath205 , depending on the observational constraint of dust mass .",
    "we expect the peak of the ir sed of  to be around @xmath147 m , but galactic cirrus may hamper its detection at these wavelengths .",
