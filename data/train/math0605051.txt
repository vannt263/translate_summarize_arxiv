    "* 1 . goal of the paper . * in this paper , we consider applications of coherent risk measures  to    optimization ;    optimality pricing ;    equilibrium .    the optimization problem is considered in three forms .",
    "first we study what we call the _ agent - independent optimization_. it is in fact the markowitz - type optimization problem with variance replaced by a coherent risk measure , instead of variance .",
    "the function @xmath0 with @xmath1 is , in fact , an example of a coherent risk measure ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "thus , in essence , semivariance is a particular case of the coherent risk . ]",
    "i.e. a problem of the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 means the discounted p&l earned by a portfolio and @xmath4 is a coherent risk measure ( p&l means the profit&loss , i.e. the difference between the terminal wealth and the initial wealth ) .",
    "let us remark that this problem was considered in  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "is defined by a finite number of probabilistic scenarios , then the corresponding optimization problem becomes the one considered in the generalized neyman ",
    "pearson lemma ( see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "as opposed to these papers , we have at our disposal the notion of a _ generator _ introduced in  @xcite . in terms of generators",
    ", we are able to give a geometric solution of   ( see figures  1 , 2 ) .",
    "the model we are considering takes into account such market imperfections as cone portfolio constraints , transaction costs , and the ambiguity of the historic probability measure .",
    "problem   is the optimization problem for an investor whose capital evolves in a risk - free way .",
    "however , an investor might have a risky endowment with a random terminal wealth  @xmath5 ( @xmath5 might have a financial or a non - financial structure ; for example , it might be the terminal wealth of a firm producing some goods ) .",
    "the investor trying to minimize his / her risk by trading in the market faces the problem @xmath6 note that this coincides with the superreplication problem for the ngd pricing ( see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* subsect .  3.6 ) ) .",
    "we study   in two forms , which we call the _ global _ and the _ local single - agent optimization _ , respectively . on the financial side ,",
    "the former pertains to a `` small '' investor , while the latter pertains to a `` big '' investor . for both of them",
    ", we provide a geometric solution ( see figures  4 , 6 ) .",
    "also , in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sect .  5 )",
    ", we provide sufficient conditions for the uniqueness of a solution of various optimization problems .",
    "after considering the optimization problem , we return to the pricing problem and apply the obtained results to the optimality pricing of contingent claims ( in the finance literature , this is typically referred to as reservation pricing ) .",
    "again , we propose three forms of this technique .",
    "they differ by the inputs they require and the assumptions behind them ( thus , of course , they produce different outputs ) .    the first technique , which we call the _ agent - independent optimality pricing _",
    ", might be considered as the limit case of the raroc - based ngd pricing technique introduced in  @xcite .",
    "a rather surprising outcome of this technique is that it provides ( typically ) a single fair price of a contingent claim for all agents ( under the strong assumption that all the agents are using the same historic measure  @xmath7 and the same risk measure  @xmath4 and all the agents are trying to maximize raroc defined through  @xmath7 and  @xmath4 ) .",
    "another technique is called the _ single - agent optimality pricing_. it is , in fact , the coherent version of the classical utility - indifference pricing with the expected utility replaced by the coherent one . as an outcome",
    ", this technique typically provides a single number , which means the price of a contingent claim that is fair for a particular agent ( it depends on the risk measure he / she is using and on his / her endowment ) .",
    "then we consider one more technique called the _ multi - agent optimality pricing_. the idea is as follows .",
    "we have a contingent claim and several agents , each employing his / her own coherent risk measure .",
    "a price is said to be fair if it provides no trading opportunity , which would allow each agent to decrease his / her risk ( this is a modified form of the idea proposed in  @xcite ) . as an outcome , this technique typically provides a whole interval of prices , which are fair for this group of agents ( in fact , this interval is the convex hull of fair prices for these agents produced by the previous technique ) .    finally , we turn to the equilibrium problem .",
    "one of the basic results of the classical economic theory is the equivalence between the pareto optimum ( known also as the `` soviet - type optimum '' ) and the competitive optimum ( known also as the `` western - type optimum '' ) ; see  @xcite .",
    "this result is established within the framework of the expected utility .    in the present paper , we establish the analog of this result within the coherent utility framework .",
    "this is done for two types of equilibrium : for the unconstrained one ( theorem  [ ec7 ] ) and for the constrained one ( theorem  [ ei5 ] ) .",
    "a very important feature of coherent utility ( which is not shared by the expected utility ) is that it admits a rich duality theory .",
    "thus , we not only establish the equivalence between different types of equilibrium , but also provide its dual description .",
    "moreover , for the constrained equilibrium problem , we are able to provide an explicit geometric solution based on generators ( see figure  11 ) .",
    "it yields the equilibrium price as well as the equilibrium portfolios of the agents .    *",
    "2 . structure of the paper . * section  [ o ] deals with the optimization problem . in subsections  [ og ] , [ gog ] , and  [ log ] , we consider the three techniques described above . in subsection  [ os ] , the obtained results are applied to the problem of finding the optimal structure of a firm consisting of several units .",
    "the provided theorem states that a structure is optimal if and only if the _ raroc contributions _ of different units are the same . in subsection",
    "[ upl ] , we apply the obtained results to the study of the liquidity effects in the framework of the ngd pricing considered in  @xcite .    section  [ op ] is related to the optimality pricing .",
