    "since the first interference measurement @xcite on two expanding condensates there has been a growing interest in the experimental and theoretical study on the interference of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) . in particular , optical lattices created by retroreflected laser beams provide a unique tool for testing at a fundamental level the quantum properties of becs in a periodic potential @xcite .",
    "the interference patterns obtained from the expansion of an array of condensates trapped in an optical lattice are commonly used as a probe of the phase properties of this system @xcite .",
    "current understanding of the interference of becs is largely based on the concept of phase coherence which reveals the superfluidity and the matter wave nature of the condensates .    for the interference of two condensates",
    ", it is shown that an interference pattern arises whether they are initially in phase state ( with locked relative phase ) @xcite or in fock state ( with definite particle number ) @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "the interference effect is still originated from a well - defined relative phase which is `` built up '' during the sequences of measurement , i.e. , the definite phase is derived from the dynamic evolution of this system ( initially with random relative phase ) . for a fully coherent array of condensates in optical lattices ,",
    "the interference pattern obtained from the free expansion is a natural result of the fixed relative phases between different condensates belonging to consecutive wells @xcite . when the coherent array of condensates enter the mott insulating phase ( mip ) r17,r18 in which phase coherence is lost , things become complicated .",
    "the pioneering experiment @xcite of the superfluid to mott - insulator transition demonstrated that when the weakly interacting gas entered the mip the interference pattern became blurry even disappeared completely .",
    "whereas for a strong interacting gas it has been pointed out that a good measure for this mott transition was excitation spectrum rather than interference pattern @xcite .",
    "besides , relevant theoretical works @xcite based on a correlation function method imply that even in the mip interference pattern should also be observed in a single measurement . on the other hand , a recent interference experiment by hadzibabic _",
    "@xcite states that the periodicity of the optical lattice is sufficient for the interference of an array of independent becs even with no phase coherence . a similar discussion is also found in a theoretical ref .",
    "it is therefore important to explore the physics of interference patterns produced following the releasing and expansion of becs .    in this paper",
    ", we present a theoretical model to investigate the interference of an array of becs confined in a spin - dependent optical lattice , which is motivated by a recent experiment by mandel _",
    "the interference patterns obtained from our theoretical model and numerical calculations agree well with those observed in the experiment @xcite .",
    "our conclusion is that the interference of an array of bose condensates trapped in a spin - dependent optical lattice results from the entanglement of a single atom and the interference is irrelevant with the phases of individual condensates .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .  2 , after introducing the basic spirit of the experiment @xcite",
    "a theoretical model is presented . in sec .  3 ,",
    "we calculate numerically the density distributions of the wave packets in spin states @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "then we compare the theoretical interference patterns with those observed in the experiment .",
    "the following sec .  4 deals with an experimental suggestion of nonuniform phase distribution , which can be used to test further the theoretical model and prediction .",
    "finally , discussion and conclusion is given in sec .",
    "for a bose - condensed gas in a harmonic magnetic trap and a three - dimensional ( 3d ) optical lattice , the atoms are localized on individual lattice sites when the system enters the mip . after switching off the magnetic trap and the lattice potentials along the @xmath2 and @xmath3 directions there only exists a 1d spin - dependent optical lattice along the @xmath4 direction which is formed by two counterpropagating laser beams with linear polarization vectors enclosing an angle @xmath5 .",
    "then each atom is prepared into a coherent superposition of two spin states @xmath6 and @xmath7 using a microwave pulse . by changing the polarization angle @xmath5 one can realize the splitting and transport of atomic wave packets such that the wave packets of an atom in spin states @xmath1 and @xmath8 respectively",
    "are transported in opposite directions , which is the so - called spin - dependent transport . finally , the optical lattice is turned off and the emerging interference patterns can be used as a diagnosis signal for the coherence of the spin - dependent transport . in a word , the spin - dependent transport is the principal idea of the experiment by mandel _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "our starting point is that there is an array of bose condensates formed in the 1d spin - dependent optical lattice along the horizontal @xmath4 direction when the magnetic trap and the lattice potentials along the @xmath2 and @xmath3 directions are turned off . since the system experienced a mott transition in advance these condensates do not have any phase coherence relative to each other any more . in this situation",
    ", the tunnelling between neighboring lattice sites is suppressed and the effects of the atomic interactions during the expansion of the condensates can be neglected , which holds in the experiment .",
    "since each condensate confined in the lattice potential is fully coherent , in the frame of single particle theory it can be described by a single order parameter @xmath9\\phi _ { k}$ ] according to the hartree or mean - field approximation @xcite , where @xmath10 is the single - particle wave function in the @xmath11th lattice site and @xmath12 is the initially random relative phase of the @xmath11th condensate .",
    "the coefficient @xmath13 represents the average particle number of each condensate , with @xmath14 denoting the total particle number of the whole condensate , and @xmath15 being the total number of lattice sites .    following the experimental manipulation sequence in @xcite",
    ", we now consider an atom with two spin states @xmath1 and @xmath8 forming its two logical basis - vectors .",
    "initially , the atom lies in spin state @xmath16 . without loss of generality , by using an initial arbitrary @xmath17 microwave pulse to drive rabi oscillations between the two spin states ,",

    "the phase @xmath26 is almost constant throughout the cloud of atoms and its absolute value is small .",

    "@xmath31 is a normalization constant , and @xmath32 denotes the width of the condensate in each optical well . by applying a final @xmath33 microwave pulse whose transform rule is given by eq.([evolution rule ] ) , one has    @xmath34    where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are respectively given by    @xmath37\\exp [ -\\frac{% ( x - kd)^{2}}{2\\sigma ^{2 } } ]   \\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\sin [ \\frac{\\alpha } { 2}]\\exp [ i\\beta -\\frac{(x-(k+r)d)^{2}}{2\\sigma ^{2}}% ] \\ } ,   \\label{wave function of spin 0 } \\\\",

    "the phase fluctuation is characterized by the fluctuations in the chemical potential r27,r28,r29 . in the presence of a 1d optical lattice with sufficiently strong intensity , the phase fluctuations for different condensates in individual wells are independent from each other .",
    "two dominating physical ingredients are responsible for the creation of phase diffusion : one is the collision between condensed atoms and background hot cloud ( thermal fluctuation ) , and the second is spontaneously collective excitation due to quantum fluctuation @xcite . in real experiments , the phase diffusion effect is small and can be omitted safely . actually , when taking into account the phase diffusion effect , the holistic characters of interference pattern will not change except that the central peak of the interference pattern will decrease a little relatively @xcite .",
    "obviously , there is no interference between the wave packets in different spin states as the two logical basis - vectors @xmath52 and @xmath39  are orthogonal .",
    "the following model is based on an assumption that for the atoms in the entangled single - atom state between the internal and external degrees of freedom each atom interferes only with itself .",
    "concretely , the density distributions of the wave packets in spin states @xmath1 or @xmath53 , i.e. , the density distributions of the overall condensates confined in the total occupied lattice sites , are not expressed by eqs.([density of spin 0 ] ) and ( [ density of spin 1 ] )    @xmath54\\xi _ { 0,k}(x , t)\\right\\vert ^{2 } , \\label{density of spin 0 } \\\\ n_{1}(x , t ) & = & \\left\\vert \\sum_{k =- k_{m}}^{k_{m}}\\sqrt{\\frac{n}{2k_{m}+1}}% \\exp [ i\\theta _ { k}]\\xi _ { 1,k}(x , t)\\right\\vert ^{2 } , \\label{density of spin 1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    but given by eqs.([simplified density of spin 0 ] ) and ( [ simplified density of spin 1 ] )    @xmath55    the test criterion of this model depends on whether its theoretical prediction accords with the experimental results , i.e. , whether this model can interpret well the experiment . then we perform a monte - carlo analysis of @xmath56 by assigning sets of random numbers to the phase @xmath57 .",
    "our simulation results show that the interference patterns based on eq.([density of spin 1 ] ) do nt agree with those observed in the experiment @xcite at all . in addition , provide that there are locked phases for individual condensates , i.e. , the phase @xmath12 is not random ( a simplest case is that the phase of each condensate is the same ) , the calculation also shows that the interference patterns derived from eq.([density of spin 1 ] ) are not in agreement with the experimental results .",
    "thus it is implied that eqs.([density of spin 0 ] ) and ( [ density of spin 1 ] ) are invalid in explaining the experiment . as expected , however , we find that the theoretical interference patterns based on eq.([simplified density of spin 1 ] ) agree well with the observed interference patterns in the experiment ( see fig.1-fig.2 in section 3 ) , which indicates that this model , i.e. eqs.([simplified density of spin 0 ] ) and ( [ simplified density of spin 1 ] ) , can be employed to describe the real physics of the emerging interference patterns in the experiment @xcite .",
    "the physical essence of the density distributions expressed by eqs.(simplified density of spin 0 ) and ( [ simplified density of spin 1 ] ) is that due to the entanglement of a single atom each atom interferes only with itself ( or each condensate interferes only with itself ) , i.e. , there is no interference effect between two arbitrary different condensates . in other words ,",
    "the entanglement of a single atom is sufficient for the interference of the overall condensates and this interference will be irrelevant with the phases of individual condensates .",
    "by using the experimental parameters in @xcite , we plot the density distributions of the atomic wave packets in states @xmath52 and @xmath39 respectively based on eqs.([simplified density of spin 0 ] ) and ( [ simplified density of spin 1 ] ) .      in the following calculations ,",
    "the relevant parameters are consistent with those in the experiment , where @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 nm , and @xmath61 nm . for simplicity , we treat the relative phase @xmath26 as zero .",
    "nevertheless , we ll also take into account the effect of it on the interference patterns to compare with the omitted case .",
    "since the value of @xmath32 , which characterizes the width of condensate in each lattice site , is chiefly determined by the optical confinement r11 , one can evaluate it in terms of a variational calculation . as a result , the ratio @xmath62 is obtained .",
    "the total number of the lattice sites @xmath15 can be determined theoretically by the formula @xmath63 ( see eq.(10 ) in @xcite ) , where the geometric average of the magnetic frequencies @xmath64 hz , @xmath65 is the mass of @xmath66rb atom , the oscillator atom , the oscillator length @xmath67 , and the s - wave scattering length for @xmath66rb atom is @xmath68 .",
    "thus @xmath69 is obtained from the above equation .      in order to compare with the experiment ,",
    "we consider firstly the density distribution of the wave packets in state @xmath0 after the optical lattice is switched off with a time of flight being 14 ms .",
    "the analytical result of @xmath56 at time @xmath49 is given by eq.(simplified density of spin 1 ) . shown in fig.1(a ) is the density distribution ( in units of @xmath70 ) in state @xmath39 at @xmath71 ms after initially localized atoms have been delocalized over two lattice sites .",
    "note that in all the figures plotted in this paper the horizontal coordinate @xmath4 is in units of @xmath72 m and the vertical coordinate is in units of @xmath70 .",
    "the density distributions in the cases that initially localized atoms have been delocalized over three ( b ) , four ( c ) , five ( d ) , six ( e ) , and seven ( f ) lattice sites are given in fig.1(b)(f ) , respectively , where the delocalized extension  is denoted by @xmath25 .",
    "with the separation @xmath25 increasing , we see that the fringe spacing of interference patterns decreases remarkably and the visibility of the interference patterns reduces distinctively ( see fig.1 ) , which is in agreement with the experimental results ( see fig.4 in @xcite ) .    in fig.2",
    ", we show the evolution of the density distribution in state @xmath8 after initially localized atoms have been delocalized over three lattice sites . displayed in fig.2(b )",
    "is the density distribution at @xmath73 ms , which agrees well with the observed interference pattern in the experiment ( see fig.5 in @xcite ) .    in the calculations mentioned above , we have neglected the effect of the relative phase @xmath26 on the density distribution by treating it as zero . displayed in fig.3",
    "are the density distributions for the relative phase @xmath74 with @xmath75 and @xmath76 respectively . when taking into account the relative phase @xmath26 between the two wave packets the right - hand side peaks of the density distributions become higher than the left - hand side ones , which breaks the symmetry of the interference patterns to a certain extent .",
    "in addition , the larger the absolute value of the phase @xmath26 is , the weaker the symmetry of the interference pattern becomes . according to the observed interference patterns",
    ", we can conclude that the absolute value of the phase @xmath26 is possibly close to zero in the experiment @xcite .",
    "now , we discuss the density distributions in state @xmath52 which were not observed in @xcite . similarly to the foregoing analysis , the analytical result of the density distributions in state @xmath1 is given by eq.([simplified density of spin 0 ] ) . shown in fig.4",
    "are the density distributions in state @xmath38 at time @xmath71ms .",
    "in contrast with the density distributions in state @xmath39 , the positions of the sharp peaks in fig.4(a)(f ) just become those of local minimum densities in fig.1(a)(f ) and vice versa , which can be interpreted by the conservation of energy and particle number .",
    "as mentioned above , the bose condensates confined in the 1d spin - dependent optical lattice have no phase coherence relative to each other as the system experienced a mott transition beforehand .",
    "in this situation , the density distributions of the atomic wave packets based on our theoretical model are in good agreement with the observed interference patterns in @xcite . from the theoretical model ( see eqs.([simplified density of spin 0 ] ) and ( [ simplified density of spin 1 ] ) ) , the density distributions of the atomic wave packets in different spin states are irrelevant with the phases of individual condensates in this system . hence , when there is a locked phase distribution for the array of condensates , the density distributions will not change .    to test further the validity of this model",
    ", we propose an experimental suggestion of nonuniform phase distribution .",
    "concretely , we design a fixed linear phase distribution with a total width of @xmath77 for the array of condensates , in which the phase difference between two neighboring condensates is @xmath78 ( @xmath69 ) , i.e. , the phase of the @xmath11th condensate can be expressed by @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "this goal can be achieved by using the techniques of phase redistributions such as phase imprinting @xcite and phase engineering @xcite .",
    "once a nonuniform phase distribution is performed successfully on the array of condensates , one applies an initial @xmath81 microwave pulse to drive rabi oscillations between the two spin states @xmath1 and @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "thus all the atoms initially in spin state @xmath1 are placed in a coherent superposition of the two spin states , where the transform rule is given by eq.([evolution rule ] ) .",
    "the following deduction is similar to that in the preceding sections . after a spin - dependent transport and applying a final @xmath33 microwave pulse as well as a releasing of the optical lattice , the density distributions of the wave packets in states @xmath1 and @xmath0 respectively would be given by eqs.([density of spin 0 ] ) and ( [ density of spin 1 ] ) if there were interference effects between different condensates . in this case",
    ", the density distributions would be quite different from fig.1-fig.4 . shown in fig.5 would be the density distribution of the wave packets at time @xmath73 ms with @xmath82 and @xmath83 . from fig.5",
    ", we can see that there exists a strong decay and revival of the density oscillation , and there is even no legible interference fringe ( see fig.5(b ) ) .",
    "due to the entanglement of a single atom , however , we predict that after the nonuniform phase distribution the density distributions of the wave packets in states @xmath1 and @xmath39 respectively are still given by eqs.([simplified density of spin 0 ] ) and ( [ simplified density of spin 1 ] ) , i.e. , the density distributions will not change . in other words , for the atoms in the entangled single - atom state",
    "each atom interferes only  with itself whether the condensates are full coherent ( with fixed relative phases ) or completely independent ( with random relative phases ) , which implies that the entanglement of a single atom is sufficient for the interference of becs in a spin - dependent optical lattice and the interference effect is irrelevant with the phases of the individual condensates .",
    "this experimental proposal provides a straight way to test further our theoretical model and prediction .",
    "to summarize , we have developed a theoretical model to investigate the interference of an array of becs confined in a 1d spin - dependent optical lattice by calculating the density distributions and evolution of the atomic wave packets .",
    "in such a system as experienced beforehand a mott transition and a spin - dependent transport , each atom can be described by an entangled single - atom state between the internal ( spin ) and the external ( spatial wave packet ) degrees of freedom .",
    "our theoretical model is based on an assumption that for the atoms in the entangled single - atom state each atom interferes only  with itself .",
    "the results obtained from this model agree well with the interference patterns observed in a recent experiment @xcite , which in turn verifies the validity of this model and assumption . in addition ,",
    "when taking into account the relative phase @xmath26 between the two wave packets of an atom which is obtained during the transport process , it is found that the symmetry of the density distributions is broken to a certain extent .    from the present work",
    ", it has been shown that due to the entanglement of a single atom each atom interferes only with itself ( or each condensate interferes only with itself in this system ) , i.e. , there is no interference effect between two arbitrary different condensates . in other words ,",
    "the entanglement of a single atom is sufficient for the interference of becs confined in a spin - dependent optical lattice and the interference shows no relevancy with the phases of individual condensates .",
    "finally , an experimental suggestion of nonuniform phase distribution is proposed to test further our theoretical model and prediction .",
    "the theoretical model presented here can be also applied to describe the dynamics of becs trapped in a combined harmonic and optical lattice potential , wherein the number of atoms in individual lattice sites is different .",
    "possibly , the method even can be extended to consider the case of non - perfect mott - insulator state .",
