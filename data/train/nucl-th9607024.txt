    "during the last few years there has been an impressive improvement in the methodology used to perform fully microscopic calculations for the ground - state properties of nuclear systems .",
    "most progress has been made for light nuclei , particularly the systems of three and four nucleons , where quite different methods , including monte carlo methods @xcite , faddeev and faddeev - yakubovski methods @xcite , hyperspherical harmonic expansions @xcite , and translationally invariant configuration interaction methods @xcite , have been pushed to a high level of reliability .",
    "ideally one would like to extend as many of the methods as possible to heavier systems .",
    "unfortunately , however , some of these methods are specially designed for very light systems , and can not easily be extended to heavier systems .",
    "the green s function monte carlo methods have been extended to systems of up to six nucleons , but it is unlikely that such methods will be able to tackle systems with more than a few additional nucleons in the foreseeable future .",
    "the hyperspherical harmonic method is also limited in the number of nucleons it can treat , even though the pisa group has started an ambitious project for @xmath2-shell nuclei .",
    "arias de saavedra _",
    "_ @xcite have recently investigated the application of the fermi hypernetted chain ( fhnc ) method to heavier nuclei , with some apparent success .",
    "another promising approach is one based on a stochastic variational principle @xcite , but this method is also limited to relatively light nuclei .",
    "we should also mention the variational monte carlo calculations of @xmath3o @xcite which have considered realistic interactions .",
    "these impressive calculations , however , have used a multiplicative cluster expansion to deal with the operatorial structure of the trial wave function .    in this paper",
    "we shall discuss another approach , which was pioneered by us some years ago @xcite .",
    "this translationally invariant configuration interaction ( tici ) method was inspired by the coupled cluster ( cc ) method . in its lowest - order implementation ( cc2 ) the coupled cluster method consists of using wave functions obtained by acting on a reference state with the exponentiated one- and two - body correlation operators , @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "the cc method is most naturally formulated in the occupation - number representation . however , as was to be expected , we found very slow convergence with respect to the cut - off on the single - particle basis in this representation .",
    "this led us to consider a linearised form of the cc2 approach , namely the tici2 method , which also includes pair correlation effects but which can easily be converted to coordinate representation .",
    "it has the trial wave function @xmath5 must be a harmonic - oscillator shell - model function .",
    "in contrast to the standard cc2 method , the tici2 method is variational , and leads to an upper bound to the ground - state energy .",
    "the simple form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : wf0 ] ) for the wave function has provided very good estimates of the ground - state energy of @xmath6he for simple wigner forces @xcite . when we revert to occupation - number representation",
    ", we find that the ansatz ( [ eq : wf0 ] ) corresponds to the most general shell - model excitation operators containing both one particle - one hole and two particle - two hole components .",
    "these components have to be appropriately related so as to ensure the translational invariance .    one obvious improvement of this ansatz is the introduction of three - body correlations , of the form @xmath7 our calculations using this form of trial wave function , with a simple model interaction in @xmath8he , produced almost the exact energy for the ground state @xcite .",
    "as one can see , we have a systematic way of improving the wave function , by adding terms of physical relevance .",
    "one may expect that , in medium light nuclei , one must include only up to three- and maybe four - body correlations , in order to get a precise determination of the energy and the structure of the system .",
    "on the other hand , one must also deal with the complex operatorial structure of realistic nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interactions , which in turn requires an additional operatorial structure for the correlation operator . at the same time",
    ", one also needs to find a way to extend the method to deal with nuclei with a larger number of particles . as is also true for some ( but not all ) of the other approaches cited above",
    ", this extension is trivial , but the underlying computational complexity requires an appreciable effort .",
    "we should recall the obvious fact that the expectation value of a two - particle operator , like the nn potential , between states of the type of eq .",
    "( [ eq : wf0 ] ) requires the evaluation of the expectation value of up to six - body operators .",
    "these calculations are large but not prohibitively so .",
    "the dual purpose of this work is to show how this kind of computation may be carried out in practice , and also to investigate the importance of the operatorial structure of the pair correlation . in this paper",
    "we are considering simple interactions of the v4 form ( central , but spin- and isospin - dependent ) .",
    "we also consider a two - particle correlation operator of the same structure , i.e. , with the spin- and isospin - dependent form @xmath9    in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] we discuss the computational problems associated with this form of correlation operator and our way of tackling them .",
    "our scheme goes beyond the typical shell - model methodology , which basically deals with two - body operators . in its current form our calculations",
    "are limited to selected nuclei , specifically to those systems which may be described or approximated by spin - isospin saturated wave functions . at the cost of losing the rotational invariance ,",
    "one may basically deal with @xmath10 nuclei , where @xmath11 is an integer . for some systems ( like , e.g. ,",
    "@xmath12c or @xmath13be ) it is actually better to break the rotational symmetry in favour of a deformed structure . in these nuclei",
    "the energy of the deformed state is much lower than that built on a spherical state of the _ jj _ coupling scheme . a further restriction on the nuclei we can deal with originates from the fact that our method makes intricate use of @xmath0-coupling .",
    "this means that our method will not perform well beyond the shell closure at @xmath14ca .",
    "having discussed our methodology in some considerable detail , we then turn to a comparison of results in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "our main goal is to gain some insight into both the power of our method and any associated shortcomings .",
    "we make a detailed comparison with other many - body methods and exact results where available .",

    "in this section we shall show how to calculate matrix elements of a v4-type potential , when the correlations are of the form given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pairc ] ) .",
    "we present all reductions of the required @xmath15-body matrix elements by identifying the minimal set of integrals that we are required to calculate .",
    "the reduction of spin and isospin degrees of freedom is also discussed , for the case of saturated systems .",
    "the discussion has been limited to the case of the expectation value of the potential , which is the most complex quantity we need to evaluate . a similar , but much less complicated ,",
    "analysis can be carried out for the kinetic energy operator as well as for the computation of the norm of the pair - correlated state .",
    "let @xmath16 represent an independent - particle harmonic - oscillator shell - model wave function for the nucleus under consideration .",
    "for the case of the spin - isospin saturated systems in which we are interested , this uncorrelated state may be represented by a _ single _",
    "slater determinant , which is hence fully characterised by the enumeration of the occupied single - particle states .",
    "moreover , given that we are dealing with spin- and isospin - saturated systems , it is only necessary to specify the harmonic oscillator states occupied , and we can ignore spin and isospin for the characterisation of the states .",
    "for example , the uncorrelated state for @xmath3o requires the four single - particle states @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where the subscript refers to the magnetic quantum number .",
    "we can transform to a cartesian basis where the occupied single - particle states are represented by the three harmonic oscillator quantum numbers @xmath21 .",
    "the reference state for @xmath3o in this basis consists of slater determinant formed from the four occupied states @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "consider now the expectation value of the potential energy operator , given by @xmath26 where the subscripts @xmath27 and @xmath28 identify ( for later ease of discussion ) the correlation operators at the left hand side and the right hand side of the potential operator , respectively .",
    "the indices in parentheses label the particles involved in the corresponding correlation or potential operator . when we expand the sums in eq .",
    "( [ potential_1 ] ) there appears a total of @xmath29 terms .",
    "one way to classify the individual terms is by the number @xmath30 of particles involved .",
    "this number ranges from 2 ( e.g. , a term @xmath31 ) up to six ( e.g. , a term @xmath32 ) .",
    "moreover , in order to reduce the @xmath15-particle matrix element to an @xmath30-particle matrix element it is convenient to decompose the operator of eq .",
    "( [ potential_1 ] ) into a sum of _ symmetric _ @xmath30-body operators .",
    "it is very simple to make a diagrammatic analysis of these operators by assigning to all @xmath33 s and @xmath34 s a line connecting the points specified in their arguments @xcite .",
    "the topologically distinct diagrams constitute a natural basis for the expansion of the matrix elements .",
    "with some patience one then obtains the decomposition @xmath35 where the symmetric operators @xmath36 are defined in table [ diagrams ] . to clarify the meaning of this table ,",
    "let us evaluate , for example , the three body part of @xmath37 . according to the table",
    "it can be expanded in the diagrams 2 till 5 as @xmath38\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the sum over permutations @xmath39 includes the six permutations of the triplet @xmath40 . in other cases",
    "there may be restrictions on the permutations , as mentioned in the table .",
    "the number of permutations @xmath41 of a given diagram under these restriction is listed in the last column of the table .",
    "this allows the enumeration of the diagrams to be checked , since they must satisfy the equality @xmath42 where @xmath43 refers to a given diagram , and @xmath44 is the number of particles involved in that diagram .",
    ".the topologically distinct diagrams for potential matrix elements .",
    "the column labelled @xmath43 gives a unique label for each diagram , @xmath44 specifies the number of particles involved .",
    "the column labelled @xmath45 gives the particle labels ( @xmath46 ) of the left - hand side correlation function , @xmath34 those ( @xmath47 ) of the potential and @xmath48 those ( @xmath49 ) of the right - hand side correlation .",
    "the diagrams must be symmetrised with respect to the particle labels @xmath50 involved , but with some restrictions to avoid overcounting .",
    "these restrictions are given by the order in which the labels appear on the functions @xmath51 and @xmath34 .",
    "the number of permutations @xmath41 under these restrictions is given in the last column .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     in order to be able to judge the power of our technology we compare several different methodologies for the purely scalar mt v potential in table [ tab : mtv ] . for @xmath8he",
    "our results compare favourably with the green s function and diffusion monte carlo results , both of which have now been superseded by various highly accurate calculations , including one based on the stochastic variational principle ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references in that paper ) .",
    "more surprising is the comparison for @xmath3o . for the mt",

    "our calculations with only two - body correlations are able to reproduce over 80% of the binding energy ( 974 mev for tici2(sd ) as compared to 1189 mev for the very accurate dmc result ) .",
    "inclusion of state - independent three - body correlations in our calculation  a relatively straightforward extension  should probably be able to give a highly accurate answer .",
    "the tici2 method also appears to be competitive with several of the methods based on jastrow - correlated non - interacting wave functions of a single slater determinant form , where the jastrow correlation operator is a product over all pairs of particles of a scalar ( state - independent ) pair function of the interparticle distance only .",
    "the many - body energy expectation value for such trial jastrow wave functions can not be calculated analytically , but may be calculated within controlled error bands using variational monte carlo ( vmc ) techniques .",
    "each of the three vmc results cited in table [ tab : mtv ] is of this form , with the differences between them resulting from different choices of single - particle wave functions and from different forms of the jastrow correlation function over which the variational search is made .",
    "these are discussed in more detail below . as an alternative to the stochastically exact vmc calculations of the energy expectation value ,",
    "the various fermi hypernetted chain ( fhnc ) approximations @xcite represent massively resummed cluster expansions of the same quantity , in which some cluster terms ( of chain or ladder form ) are summed to all orders but various so - called elementary diagrams are neglected or approximated .",
    "the resulting fhnc approximants for the ground - state energy are no longer strict variational bounds , insofar as the higher - order terms have been neglected .",
    "firstly , the vmc result of @xmath52 mev for the binding of @xmath3o with the mt v potential from ref .",
    "@xcite uses single - particle wave functions generated by a woods - saxon potential and a scalar jastrow correlation function obtained from a constrained euler - lagrange optimisation of the second order cluster expansion approximation to the energy functional .",
    "we note that the corresponding result from the lowest order fhnc calculation , in the formulation of fantoni and rosati , the so - called fhnc/0 method @xcite in which the elementary diagrams are neglected completely , using the same single - particle wave functions and jastrow correlation function , is @xmath53 mev . secondly , the vmc result of @xmath54 mev from ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath3o binding energy employs harmonic oscillator single - particle wave functions and a jastrow correlation function of gaussian form , @xmath55 , with the oscillator length parameter and the constants @xmath56 and @xmath57 optimised . finally , the similar vmc result of @xmath58  from ref .",
    "@xcite uses optimised harmonic oscillator single - particle wave functions and a jastrow correlation function of the form @xmath59 .",
    "we note that a so - called fhnc//0 calculation for @xmath3o using the mt v potential has been performed by krotscheck @xcite . by using the best possible choices for both the single particle wave functions and the jastrow correlation function ( i.e. , by solving the corresponding euler - lagrange equation which arise by making the fhnc//0 energy functional stationary ) he obtains a value of 1059 mev for the binding energy .",
    "furthermore , by optimising only the jastrow correlation function via his euler - lagrange approach , and using single - particle wave functions obtained from a woods - saxon potential which reproduces the r.m.s .",
    "radius of the gfmc calculation of ref.@xcite , he obtains the only very slightly worse value of 1055 mev .",
    "he estimates , using the fhnc/@xmath60 approximation that the contribution from the neglected exchange diagrams is @xmath61 mev .",
    "we also note that by employing precisely the same nearly optimal woods - saxon single - particle wave functions , but with a jastrow correlation function obtained from a constrained minimisation of the two - body cluster expansion approximation to the energy functional , a corresponding fhnc/0 calculation @xcite gives a @xmath3o binding energy of @xmath62 mev .",
    "this difference of nearly @xmath63 mev is presumably a measure of the uncertainty in the fhnc/0 results , in the light of the other results cited .",
    "it seems rather unlikely that the corresponding vmc calculation for this same wave function will give such a large value for the binding energy .",

    "the effect of the incorporation of the state - dependent correlations in our tici2 calculations is again to increase the binding energy by about 20 mev .",

    "we have demonstrated that the tici2 methodology provides a very reasonable starting point for the calculation of the binding energies of light - to - medium mass nuclei .",
    "the important state - dependent pairwise correlation effects can be efficiently incorporated without destroying the variational bound .",
    "by contrast , most competing many - body methods suffer from various uncontrolled approximations , which often include the loss of a strict upper bound on the ground - state energy , even when the calculation starts from a variational framework .",

    "since such techniques provide perhaps the main competitor to our own approach outlined here , it is worth describing in some detail the source of the uncertainties that can typically arise in fhnc - type calculations .    in a nutshell , the standard fhnc formulation of fantoni and rosati sums all of the jastrow cluster - expansion terms that can readily be summed by one - dimensional integral equations ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references cited therein for details ) .",
    "one drawback of this procedure is that certain cancellations between elementary exchange diagrams are thereby ignored .",

    "the resulting prescription is both clear - cut and leads to relatively simple integral equations which are valid for small distances",
    ". nevertheless , the long - range parts are more problematic . in particular , for infinite homogeneous systems one neither expects to get nor obtains the correct behaviour of the liquid structure function @xmath71 as @xmath72 .",
    "moreover this prescription does not allow , in principle , for correct optimisation .",
    "in contrast to the fantoni - rosati fhnc/@xmath11 scheme , krotscheck has proposed a different classification which maintains the pauli principle at each step .",
    "one possibility among several to accomplish this is to classify the exchange diagrams with respect to the number of internal lines rather than vertices .",
    "the resulting lowest - order approximant in this scheme is termed fhnc//0 .",
    "in some well - defined sense it sums the union of the equivalents of the ring diagrams with a bare particle propagator and bosonic ladder terms . effectively , for the case of infinite homogeneous systems , it sums correctly and self - consistently the most important diagrams in coordinate space when short - range correlations are important , and in momentum space when long - range correlations are important . in turn",
    "this leads to an inconsistency between the pair distribution function , @xmath73 , and the liquid structure function , @xmath71 .    from the above brief discussion it should be clear that the main difficulty and uncertainty in fhnc techniques is in the treatment of elementary exchange diagrams .",

    "basically this scheme exploits the fact that one knows the values of these diagrams in the case of an infinite homogeneous system at momentum transfers @xmath74 and @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the fermi momentum .",
    "the fhnc/@xmath60 scheme uses these exact properties to estimate the value of the omitted terms by a simple polynomial interpolation between these limits .",
    "thus fhnc/@xmath60 is a superset of fhnc/0 , but with an approximate treatment of what the latter omits .",
    "such a correction of the fhnc/0 equations is necessary for the optimisation .",
    "we have already commented in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] on the discrepancy between the fhnc/0 and fhnc//0 results in the case of @xmath3o with the mt v potential .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that inclusion of the @xmath60 class of diagrams has only a marginal influence .    apart from the above difficulties and uncertainties over the treatment of elementary exchange diagrams , the incorporation of state - dependent correlations into fhnc treatments is also very fraught with difficulty .",
    "this arises essentially due to the non - commutativity of the correlation operators in a jastrow - type product wave function when the scalar jastrow function is replaced by an operatorial sum .",
    "the isospin - dependent correlations introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite very recently , and reported in sec .  [ sec : results ] , have led to workable fhnc calculations only because in this case the corresponding operators commute among themselves .",
    "the introduction of more complicated operatorial forms ( e.g. , of the sort used by us ) will not provide such a straightforward extension .",
    "our own tici2 method does not suffer from these drawbacks .",
    "we now turn briefly to the alternative idea approach , which is formulated purely in terms of the hyper - radius and the relative coordinate of the two particles needed to describe the pair correlations incorporated in the method . in this method ,",
    "as currently practised , several uncontrolled and often unjustified approximations are made . as a consequence",
    "the results are non - variational , and usually one has a range of values depending on which of many approximations has been made , none of which is fundamentally preferred to another",
    ". a recent investigation @xcite of a simple model suggests rather forcefully that even if _ no _ approximations are made , the inclusion of the hyper - radial excitations in a many - body wave function that lies at the heart of the idea method does not provide a very cost - effective improvement .",
    "this study suggest that it would be much more efficient to include pair ( and triplet , etc . )",
    "correlations to the best of one s ability , as done in the present work . from this viewpoint",
    "our own method of incorporating pair correlations is far more systematic than in the idea methodology .    in conclusion ,",
    "our method works well for interactions and correlations of v4 form .",
    "of course one needs a much more complicated interaction to describe phase shifts well : the latest argonne v18 interaction has 18 components .",
    "even though it may not be immediately obvious what kind of correlations are important when one wishes to deal with such a complicated force , it is clear that the first step is to look at interactions and correlations of the v6 form , where one includes the tensor force and tensor correlations .",
    "such an investigation is now under way , and it appears that the methodology sketched in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] can be extended to deal with such a more realistic force .",
    "actually when we have v6 type correlations , we may already pick up the major part of the spin - orbit force as well ; at this level there is no easy match between the operatorial structure of the correlations and that of the potential .    in the end",
    "we shall also have to include three - body correlations .",
    "since the effect of such correlations is not expected to be very large , one might hope that inclusion of state - independent three - particle correlations is enough .",
    "this would still lead to very complicated calculations , but we believe that we can certainly deal with such a scheme .",
    "indeed , we have already reported such results for @xmath8he using purely central ( scalar ) potentials @xcite .",
    "results for heavier nuclei with more realistic potentials will be reported in the future .",
