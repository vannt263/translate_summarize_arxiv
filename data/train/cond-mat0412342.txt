    "the modeling of complex materials based upon molecular dynamics simulation has been one of the remarkable advances in theoretical condensed matter physics . whether the potentials chosen are empirical or",
    "_ ab initio _",
    ", remarkable insights have accrued for diverse problems in materials physics and beyond . there is , however , an unsatisfying point to the logic of md simulation : it does not make use of all the information available about a material under study  notably the information implied by experiments . simulations often can not achieve agreement with experiment because of short simulation times , small system sizes or inaccuracies in the interactions . successful prediction of _ new _ properties is more likely for models in agreement with existing data .",
    "imposition of experimental information may be important in phase - separated or other complex materials for which obtaining a suitable starting structure may be difficult , and for which short md time scales preclude the emergence of such structures in the model .",
    "a different approach to model construction implemented by mcgreevy@xcite and colleagues is the so - called  reverse monte carlo \" ( rmc ) method .",
    "here , one explicitly sets out to make an atomistic model which agrees with experiments .",
    "rmc has been widely used to model a variety of complex disordered materials .",
    "this is accomplished by making monte carlo moves which drive a structural model toward exact agreement with one or more experiments . in practice",
    ", rmc is the ideal method to explore the _ range _ of configurations which are consistent with experiment(s ) . without adequate limitation to a  physical \" subspace of configuration space ,",
    "it is unlikely to produce a satisfactory model .",
    "that is , only a subset of rmc models [ which match the experiment(s ) ] is physically realistic ( consistent with accurate interatomic interactions ) .",
    "the imposition of topological / chemical bonding constraints in rmc can ameliorate this problem , but not remove it entirely@xcite .",
    "the mathematical structure of constrained rmc is a constrained optimization  traveling salesman \" problem . in our previous implementation of constrained rmc we formed a positive definite ( quadratic ) cost or ",
    "penalty \" function @xmath1 , which was then minimized ( ideally , but not practically ) to zero for a structural model which exactly satisfies all constraints imposed : [ eq-1 ] = _ j=1^k _ i=1^m_j _ i^j \\{f^j_e(q_i)- f^j_c(q_i)}^2 + _ l=1^l _ l p_l    where @xmath2 is related to the uncertainty associated with the experimental data points , @xmath3 is the number of experimental data sets employed , @xmath4 is the number of data for the @xmath5 set and @xmath6 is the number of additional ( non - experimental ) constraints included .",
    "the quantity @xmath7 is the appropriate generalized variable associated with experimental data @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the penalty function associated with each additional constraint and @xmath10 .",
    "additional \" constraints can be of many different forms ( for example , one may impose chemical or topological ordering , or phase separated units within a continuous random network ) the coordinates of atoms are changed according to monte carlo moves , which is akin to a simulated annealing minimization of our cost function @xmath1 .",
    "the method is easy to implement , though care must be taken to include the minimum number of independent constraints possible to reduce the likelihood of getting  stuck \" in spurious minima .",
    "we have shown that inclusion of suitable constraints leads to models of a - si much improved compared to rmc models using only the structure factor ( first term of eq .",
    "[ eq-1 ] ) as constraint@xcite .",
    "as the creation of models of complex materials is a difficult task , it is of obvious advantage to incorporate _ all _ possible information in fabricating the model .",
    "we assert that an ideal model of a complex material should ( 1 ) be a minimum ( metastable or global ) of a suitable energy functional faithfully reproducing the structural energetics , ( 2 ) should contradict no experiments . when stated in these terms , our criterion seems quite obvious , yet current simulation schemes do not simultaneously accommodate both criteria , but focus only on one or the other .    in this paper",
    ", we merge the power of _ ab initio _ molecular simulation with the _ a priori _ information of experiments to create models consistent with experiments and the chemistry implied by accurate interatomic interactions . to obtain joint agreement , we unite md with the reverse monte carlo ( rmc ) method .",
    "we name the scheme `` experimentally constrained molecular relaxation '' ( ecmr ) .",
    "one can understand our scheme as a way to ",
    "tune \" a structural model using md within the space of _ experimentally realistic _ models as defined by rmc .",
    "we choose a troublesome and complex material with a long experimental and modeling history : g - gese@xmath0 .    from an algorithmic perspective , our scheme has important advantages .",
    "for example , to model a glass like gese@xmath0 or sio@xmath0 using first principles methods , the method of choice is to form an equilibrated liquid , use some dissipative dynamics to simulate an ( unphysically ) rapid quench of the liquid into an arrested phase and finally to relax this to a local energy minimum , presumably at astronomical fictive temperature ( high potential energy ) .",
    "usually some repeated  annealing \" cycles are also used .",
    "if one is interested in a glassy phase all the work of forming and equilibrating the liquid is redundant , and it is a pious hope that the arrested liquid will resemble a real glassy phase . evidently the likelihood for success is strongly affected by topological and chemical similarity of the melt to the physical amorphous phase . if complex ordering  self - organization \" or phase separation occurs in the physical amorphous phase , the short simulations of conventional _ ab initio _ schemes will surely miss these important structural features . in this vein , we have used ecmr to construct models of a - si with intermediate range order on a nanometer length scale@xcite by inclusion of fluctuation electron microscopy@xcite .",
    "we note that successful techniques do exist to tackle the time - scale problem@xcite , though these do not enable the inclusion of experimental information .",
    "our method is efficient enough to enable the creation of a 647 atom model of g - gese@xmath11 using only a workstation .",
    "the method is at least a factor of five faster than a comparable quench from the melt simulation , with its inherent limitations .",
    "the obvious means to incorporate interatomic interactions into an rmc simulation is to add a constraint to minimize the magnitude of the force on all the atoms according to some energy functional or to minimize the total energy . for an _ ab initio _",
    "hamiltonian this is expensive , since monte carlo minimization of eq .",
    "[ eq-1 ] requires a large number of energy / force calls .",
    "thus , we have instead employed a simple  self consistent \" iteration scheme ( indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) : ( 1 ) starting with an initial configuration c@xmath12 , minimize @xmath1 to get c@xmath0 , 2 ) steepest - descent quench c@xmath0 with an _ ab initio _ method to get c@xmath13 , ( 3 ) subject the resulting configuration to another rmc run ( minimize @xmath1 again ) , repeat steps ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) until both the md relaxed model and rmc models no longer change with further iteration . in this paper , we limit ourselves to the first term in eq .",
    "1 ( the experimental static structure factor ) , though additional constraints certainly could be employed . for the rmc component of the iteration",
    ", we make the conventional choice of using monte carlo for the minimization .",
    "this is simple and does not require gradients ( and thus allows the use of non - analytic terms in eq .",
    "[ eq-1 ]  @xcite , if desired ) .",
    "we emphasize that our method is _ flexible_. it s logic suggests that one should include whatever experimental information is available . in this paper",
    "we limit ourselves to the pair - correlation functions . in principle",
    ", other experiments could be included as well .",
    "these might be costly to include ( for example to compel agreement with the vibrational density of states , the dynamical matrix would be required at each iteration ) .",
    "the method is equally suited to fast empirical potentials , which would allow studies of very large models .",
    "it is also possible to force a close fit to some restricted range of data , and a less precise fit elsewhere if desired .",
    "our scheme also provides insight into the topological signatures of different constraints ( experimental or otherwise ) .",
    "chemical and or topological constraints could also be maintained as part of the rmc iteration .",
    "our method can be understood as a way to minimize an effective potential energy function @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the potential energy of the configuration ( denoted by @xmath16 ) , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is a non - negative cost function enforcing experimental ( or other ) constraints as in eq .",
    "empirically , we find that it is possible to find configurations that simultaneously approximately minimize both terms ( which implies that the choice of @xmath19 is not very important ) .",
    "it is also clear that our method is really _ statistical _ : in general one should generate an ensemble of conformations using ecmr .",
    "for adequately large models , self averaging can be expected ; in this study of large ( 647 atom ) models of g - gese@xmath0 we find similar results for two runs ; for small systems a proper ensemble average is required .",
    "the method is new and as such needs to be studied and developed in a number of ways .",
    "nevertheless , we show in this paper that it is relatively easy to model a particularly challenging material with significant advantages in both experimental plausibility of the model and computational efficiency of the algorithm .     ,",
    "we apply ecmr to glassy gese@xmath0 , a classic glass forming material with challenging physical and technical issues : ( 1 ) it displays nanoscale order : a  first sharp diffraction peak \" ( fsdp ) is observed in neutron diffraction measurement , ( 2 ) the packing of gese tetrahedra involves both edge- and corner- sharing topologies ; ( 3 ) the material has interesting photoresponse ( understanding of which requires the electronic structure ) , ( 4 ) the material is difficult to simulate with _ ab initio _ techniques@xcite .",
    "the model used in our calculation consists of 647 atoms in a cubic box of size 27.525  .    in the nomenclature of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , c@xmath12 is obtained by constraining the coordination number ( 2 for se , 4 for ge ) and the bond - angle distribution of se - ge - se to an approximate gaussian with an average bond angle 109.5@xmath20 .",
    "the initial network was  generic \" and included none of the detailed local chemistry of ge and se aside from the coordination and chemical ordering ( bond _ angles _ were not constrained in rmc loops ) .",
    "equal weighting was used for all experimental points in this paper . using the method of isotopic substitution ,",
    "salmon and petri  @xcite were able to separately measure the three ( ge - se , ge - ge and se - se ) partial structure factors of g - gese@xmath0 .",
    "we jointly enforced all three partials ( in real space ) in the rmc component of the loop in fig .",
    "the md relaxation was done with fireball@xcite .",
    "it was found that after the fourth iteration , s(q ) hardly changed . in table",
    "i , we show the average force per atom at the beginning of each call to md relaxation ; good convergence is observed .",
    "subsequent discussion in this paper is for the last step of the md , with forces less than @xmath21 .",
    "it was not obvious to us in the beginning that rmc and first principles interatomic interactions could be made  self - consistent \" , but for this system at least , reasonable convergence is possible .",
    "it is likely that some initial conformations c@xmath12 will get  stuck \" and require a new start , but we have not encountered difficulty with this yet .      in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we compare the rmc , ecmr and experimental structure factors . here , the rmc model is that obtained by starting with the generic c@xmath22 configuration , and forcing agreement on the experimental @xmath23 ( without any other constraints ) . while the agreement is very good , it is not perfect",
    "this is to be expected for three reasons : ( 1 ) consistency between data and hamiltonian is never exact ; ( 2 ) our cell contains 647 atoms , which is compared to the thermodynamic limit and ( 3 ) we chose to constrain our model using real space data , which involves fourier transforms and windowing ( this introduces only small errors in this data set ) . in fig .",
    "2 we highlight the differences between experiment@xcite , a quench from the melt model@xcite and the new ecmr model . in the inset of figure 2 , we also illustrate the level of agreement using a pure rmc approach , which is similar to the ecmr result and notably better than quench from the melt . for reference",
    ", we have reproduced the full partial structure factors elsewhere@xcite .",
    "note in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that the first sharp diffraction peak ( fsdp ) is well reproduced , ( very close in width and centering , and much improved from all previous models in height ) . moreover , as for our  decorate and relax \" ( dr ) method@xcite , the large @xmath7 structure closely tracks experiment ( unlike the experience for quench from the melt models which are too liquid - like and therefore decay too rapidly for large q ) .",
