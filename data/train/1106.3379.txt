    "a popular and exactly soluble model in quantum optics is the jaynes - cumming model ( jcm ) .",
    "it describes the interaction of a two - level atom with a single - mode of the electromagnetic field @xcite . over the last two decades",
    "various extensions of the ordinary jcm have been used in various directions , e.g. , as adapted to : ( i ) the study of interaction of a three - level atom with a two - mode squeezed vacuum @xcite ; ( ii ) the study of atom - field interaction in the presence of a cavity damping @xcite ; ( iii ) the same as in ( i ) , including an additional ( nonlinear ) kerr medium @xcite ; ( iv ) the two - level atoms inside a cavity acted upon by an external field control @xcite ; ( v ) study of the nonlinear dynamical evolution of a driven two - photon jaynes - cummings model @xcite ; ( vi ) the study of a generalized jaynes - cummings models , including dissipation 15,16,16a and multiphoton interactions @xcite ; etc . in all these cases , with interest either on the field or on atomic properties , the theoretical approach traditionally assumes the atom - field coupling as a constant parameter .",
    "comparatively , the number of works in the literature is very small when one considers such coupling and the atomic frequency as time dependent parameters @xcite , including time dependent amplitudes @xcite .",
    "however , this scenario is also relevant ;  for example , the state of two qubits ( qubits stand for quantum bits ) with a desired degree of entanglement can be generated via a time dependent atom - field coupling @xcite .",
    "actually , such coupling can modify the dynamical properties of the atom and the field , with transitions that involve a large number of photons @xcite .",
    "in general , these studies are simplified by neglecting the atomic decay from an excited level .",
    "theoretical treatments taking into account this complication of the real world may employ a modified jcm . in these case , as expected , the state describing the system decoheres , since the presence of dissipation destroys the state of a system as time flows .",
    "in the present work we extend what we have learned from the jcm applied to the atom - field interaction to investigate a more advantageous system , from the experimental viewpoint ( faster response , better controllability , and useful scalability for quantum computation @xcite ) by considering  a nanomechanical resonator ( nr ) interacting with a cooper pair box ( cpb ) 17,16,18 .",
    "such nanodevice has been explored extensively in the literature , e.g. , to investigate : ( i ) quantum nondemolition measurements @xcite , ( ii ) decoherence of nonclassical states , as fock states and superposition states describing mesoscopic systems @xcite , etc .",
    "the fast advance in the technique of fabrication in nanotechnology has implied great interest in the study of the nr system in view of its potential applications , as a sensor - to be used in biology , astronomy , quantum computation , and in quantum information @xcite , to implement the quantum qubit ak3 and in the production of nonclassical states , as fock state akk , bb4 , schrdinger s cat state @xcite , squeezed states a34 , clusters states @xcite , etc . in particular , when accompanied by superconducting charge qubits , the nr has been used to prepare entangled states @xcite .",
    "zhou et al.@xcite have proposed a scheme to prepare squeezed states using a nr coupled to a cpb qubit ; in this proposal the nr - cpb coupling is under an external control while the connection between these two subsystems plays an important role in quantum computation .",
    "such a control is achieved via convenient change of the system parameters , which can set  on \" and  off \" the interaction between the nr and the cpb , on demand .    in this report",
    "we will investigate the cpb excitation inversion , its control , and the average photon number in the nr .",
    "we will consider dissipation in the cpb due to a decay rate from excited to ground states .",
    "we will also verify in which way the time dependence of the cpb - nr coupling modifies these two properties .",
    "to this end we must solve the time evolution of the whole cpb - nr system , via the approach presented in the following section .",
    "a josephson charge qubit system has been used to couple with a nr . here",
    "we study a modified model where a cpb is coupled to a nr , as shown in fig .",
    "cooper below .",
    "the scheme is inspired by the works of jie - qiao liao et al .",
    "@xcite and zhou et al .",
    "@xcite where we have substituted each josephson junction by two of them .",
    "this creates a new configuration that includes a third loop .",
    "a superconducting cpb charge qubit is adjusted via a voltage @xmath0  at the system input and a capacitance @xmath1 .",
    "we want that the scheme attains an efficient tunneling effect for the josephson energy . in fig .",
    "[ cooper ] we observe three loops : one great loop between two small ones .",
    "this makes it easier controlling the external parameters of the system since the control mechanism includes the input voltage @xmath0 plus three external fluxes @xmath2 @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in this way",
    "one can induce small neighboring loops .",
    "the great loop contains a nr which is modeled as a harmonic oscillator with a high - q mode of frequency @xmath5 and its effective area in the center of the apparatus changes as the nr oscillates , which creates an external flux @xmath4 that provides the cpb - nr coupling .    in pursuing the quantum behavior of a macro scale object the nano scale mechanical resonator plays an important role . at sufficiently low temperature",
    "the zero - point fluctuation of the nr will be comparable to its thermal brownian motion .",
    "the detection of zero - point fluctuations of the nr can give a direct test of heisenberg s uncertainty principle . with a sensitivity up to 10 times the amplitude of the zero - point fluctuation ,",
    "lahaye et al @xcite have experimentally detected the vibrations of a 20 mhz mechanical beam of tens of micrometres size . for a 20mhz mechanical resonator",
    "its temperature must be cooled below 1mk to suppress the thermal fluctuation . for a ghz mechanical resonator",
    "a temperature of 50mk is sufficient to effectively freeze out its thermal fluctuation and let it enter the quantum regime .",
    "this temperature is already attainable in dilution refrigerators .        in this work",
    "we will assume the four josephson junctions being identical , with the same josephson energy @xmath6 , the same being assumed for the external fluxes @xmath7 and @xmath3 , i.e. , with same magnitude but opposite sign : @xmath8 .",
    "this interaction actually couples the two subsystems .",
    "together with the free hamiltonian of flux qubit and nr , the hamiltonian of the whole system reads    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the creation ( annihilation ) operator for the nr excitation , with frequency @xmath5  and mass @xmath11 ; @xmath6 and @xmath12 are respectively the energy of each josephson junction and the charge energy of a single electron ; @xmath1 and @xmath13 are the input capacitance and the capacitance of each josephson tunnel , respectively .",
    "@xmath14 is the quantum flux and @xmath15 is the charge number in the input with the input voltage @xmath0 .",
    "we have used the pauli matrices to describe our system operators , where the states @xmath16 and @xmath17 represent the number of extra cooper pairs in the superconducting island .",
    "we have : @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20    the magnetic flux can be written as the sum of two terms , @xmath21where the first term @xmath22 is the induced flux , corresponding to the equilibrium position of the nr and the second term describes the contribution due to the vibration of the nr ; @xmath23 represents the magnetic field created in the loop .",
    "we have assumed the displacement @xmath24 described as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the amplitude of the oscillation . substituting the eq.(a4 ) in eq.([a1 ] ) and controlling the flux @xmath22 we can adjust @xmath27 , and making the approximation @xmath28 the above hamiltonian results as ( in rotating wave approximation ) , @xmath29where the constant coupling @xmath30 and the effective energy @xmath31 an important advantage of this coupling mechanism is its easy and convenient controllability .",
    "next , we will extend the previous approach to a more general scenario by substituting @xmath32 and @xmath33 $ ] @xcite ; in addition we assume the presence of a constant decay rate @xmath34 in the cpb ; @xmath35 is the transition frequency of the cpb and @xmath36 stands for the cpb - nr  coupling . @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the cpb transition and excitation inversion operators , respectively ; they act on the hilbert space of atomic states and satisfy the commutation relations",

    "accordingly , we obtain the new ( _ non hermitian _ ) hamiltonian    @xmath45    it is worth remembering that non hermitian hamiltonians ( nhh ) are largely used in the literature . to give some few examples we mention : ref .",
