    "it is now well - known that the green s function of the wave equation can be estimated from the cross correlation of the signals emitted by ambient noise sources and recorded by passive sensors @xcite . in a homogeneous medium and when the source of the waves is a space - time stationary random field that is also delta - correlated in space and time , it has been shown @xcite that the derivative of the cross correlation of the signals recorded by two sensors is proportional to the symmetrized green s function between the sensors . in an inhomogeneous medium and",
    "when the sources completely surround the region of the sensors it can be shown using the helmholtz - kirchhoff identity that there is a relation between the cross correlation of the recorded signals and the green s function @xcite .",
    "this is true even with spatially localized noise source distributions provided the waves propagate within an ergodic cavity @xcite .",
    "more generally , in an inhomogeneous medium the cross correlation as a function of the lag time can have a distinguishable peak at plus or minus the inter - sensor travel time , provided the ambient noise sources are well distributed around the sensors .",
    "the inter - sensor travel times obtained from peaks of cross correlations can then be used tomographically for background velocity estimation @xcite .",
    "additional peaks due to reflectors can be exploited so that reflectors can be imaged by migration of the cross correlation matrix of the signals emitted by ambient noise sources and recorded by a passive receiver array @xcite . in this paper",
    "we extend these results to situations in which the receivers are moving .",
    "the use of moving receivers is motivated by the general result that resolution is better when the receiver array is large .",
    "since large physical arrays are difficult to implement , a natural idea is to implement moving sensors to generate large synthetic apertures .",
    "so far very few results are available in this direction .",
    "only sabra mentions that doppler effects should not affect green s function estimation from ambient noise cross - correlations in underwater acoustics , when the sensors are moving with a velocity of a few meters per second ( which is very small compared to the sound speed that is approximately 1500 meters per second ) @xcite .",
    "in @xcite a different but related problem is addressed : the analysis of time - reversal experiments involving a moving point source that emits a pulse .",
    "it is shown that doppler effects and lack of source - receiver reciprocity significantly affect the time - reversal refocusing when the velocity of the source becomes comparable as the speed of propagation and refocusing can be enhanced by these effects .",
    "indeed the source - receiver reciprocity property means that the recorded signal is not modified if we interchange the source and the receiver , and this comes from the symmetry of the green s function .",
    "however this reciprocity is broken when the source moves .",
    "it is also broken when the receiver moves . as we will see doppler effects and lack of reciprocity also significantly affect correlation - based imaging when the sensor velocity is comparable to the wave speed , but here",
    "resolution is reduced .",
    "we will consider the following situation in the two - dimensional set - up in sections [ sec : gre]-[sec : ref ] : noise sources are at the surface of a large ball and emit stationary random signals .",
    "a receiver is moving along a circular trajectory and records the field .",
    "the medium may be complex within the circular trajectory of the receiver ( see figure [ fig1a ] ) .",
    "it is shown that the autocorrelation function of the recorded signal is related to the matrix of green s function between pairs of points along the trajectory , more exactly to a diagonal band of this matrix whose thickness is determined by the velocity of the receiver . as an application we consider the case where a point - like reflector is present within the circular trajectory of the receiver ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) and we show how to use the autocorrelation function of the recorded signal to localize the reflector by migration .",
    "a first naive migration function is proposed .",
    "its analysis reveals that it has a strong bias and that a modification is needed when the velocity of the moving receiver is not negligible compared to the speed of propagation . by applying this modification one",
    "gets an imaging function whose bias is negligible ( i.e. smaller than the wavelength ) but whose resolution ( of the order of the wavelength ) is reduced when the velocity of the receiver increases .",
    "a variant of this situation in which the receiver is moving along a linear trajectory is addressed in section [ sec : ref2 ] ( see figure [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the analysis and conclusions are analogous to the case of a circular trajectory .    by the same strategy it is possible to study other types of situations related to passive green s function estimation with moving objects , when the sources themselves are moving . in section [ sec:1 ]",
    "we consider the case in which the ambient noise is emitted by a point - like source that moves along a circular trajectory and that emits a stationary random signal .",
    "two observation points within the circle record the field ( see figure [ fig0 ] ) . the recorded signals are cross correlated .",
    "it is shown that the cross correlation of the recorded signals is close to the green s function between the two observation points , although a correction appears when the velocity of the moving source is large and the noise bandwidth is limited .",
    "however this correction vanishes for time lags approximately equal to the travel time between the sensors , which means that travel time estimation can be carried out with a bias smaller than the resolution and with the same resolution as if we were measuring the impulse response at one sensor when the other one emits a pulse with the same spectrum as the power spectral density of the noise source .",
    "the goal of this section is to show that the autocorrelation function of the signal emitted by ambient noise sources and recorded by a unique receiver moving on a circular trajectory is related to the green s functions between pairs of points along the circular trajectory .",

    "indeed , the cross correlation function of the signals recorded by two stationary receivers at @xmath43 and @xmath44 and emitted by ambient noise sources is known to be related to the imaginary part of the green s function between the two receiver points @xcite .",
    "the standard physical explanation of this result is via an analogy with a time - reversal experiment : the cross correlation of the recorded ambient noise signals is the signal recorded by the receiver at @xmath44 during a time - reversal experiment in which a short pulse is emitted from @xmath43 , recorded by a time - reversal mirror at the surface of the ball @xmath4 , and remitted , time - reversed , into the medium .",
