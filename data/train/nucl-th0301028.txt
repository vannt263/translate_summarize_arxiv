    "it is widely accepted that triplet pairing between constituent spin-1/2 fermions gives rise to superfluid phases in liquid @xmath0he at millikelvin temperatures and in the neutronic component of the quantum fluid interior of a neutron star at temperatures in the hundred kev range and below . in both cases ,",
    "the density is so high that the familiar singlet s - wave gap is quenched by the dominant effect of the short - range repulsion in that channel . instead",
    ", pairing is favored in a channel with an odd orbital momentum @xmath5 , and therefore in the triplet spin state .",
    "the pairing mechanisms active in these two examples produce interesting distinctions between them . in superfluid @xmath0he , pairing is triggered by spin fluctuations @xcite , and the b - state ( or b - phase ) with total angular momentum @xmath6 occupies most of the superfluid phase diagram .",
    "however , the spin - fluctuation mechanism induces relatively tiny energy splittings between states with different @xmath7 values .",
    "consequently , very close to the critical temperature @xmath8 there exists a phase transition from the b - phase to the a - phase , which involves a combination of @xmath9 and @xmath10 pairing channels .",
    "the situation in neutron matter is rather different . referring to the experimental data on the energy dependence of the @xmath11 scattering phase shifts @xcite",
    ", one may infer that central forces between a neutron pair are quite weak , and that pairing must be due predominantly to the spin - orbit force .",
    "based on empirical analyses of spin - orbit splitting in finite nuclei , the latter force is expected to be insensitive to polarization and correlation effects .",
    "the spin - orbit pairing mechanism implies that the spin @xmath12 and orbital momentum @xmath13 of the pair cease to be conserved separately , and pairing in the @xmath10 channel dominates @xcite .    in both fermi quantum liquids ,",
    "the effective in - medium interaction contains a component that mixes two - body states with orbital angular momenta @xmath14 .",
    "specifically , pairing channels with @xmath5 and @xmath15 are coupled by the magnetic dipole force in the case of liquid @xmath0he and by the tensor force arising from pion exchange , in neutron matter .",
    "however , the effect is of minuscule importance in the @xmath0he problem , since the magnetic dipole component is smaller in magnitude than the dominant central part of the interaction by a factor @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the magnitude of the dominant spin - orbit force in neutron matter is only a few times larger than the tensor component , so the effects of the latter can not be neglected .",
    "( more specifically , the parameter measuring the strength of the tensor force relative to the spin - orbit force varies around @xmath17 in the density interval @xmath18 @xcite if in - vacuum interaction constants are adopted , @xmath19 being the saturation density of symmetrical nuclear matter . )",
    "moreover , pion exchange is responsible for the most powerful fluctuations in neutron matter .",
    "accordingly , it is imperative to give careful attention to + @xmath0p@xmath1@xmath0f@xmath1 channel coupling in the quantitative description of pairing in neutron matter .    reliable prediction of the phase diagram of triplet pairing over an extensive temperature range has proven to be extraordinarily difficult .",
    "the traditional tool for elucidation of the phase diagram in liquid @xmath0he and other systems manifesting superfluidity or superconductivity has been the ginzburg - landau functional approach .",
    "but since ginzburg - landau theory is valid only near the critical temperature , it has little relevance to neutron stars , which cool down to temperatures one or two orders of magnitude below @xmath8 by a thousand years after their birth in a supernova event .",
    "there is of course the alternative of brute - force iterative solution of the gap equation , which has been widely used in quantitative studies of singlet s - wave pairing @xcite .",
    "however , this strategy is generally afflicted with slow convergence and uncertain accuracy both for s - wave interactions containing strong short - range repulsions and for pairing in higher angular momentum states , where one must deal with a multitude of coupled nonlinear singular integral equations . the limitations of standard iterative approaches become particularly serious when one seeks to construct the superfluid phase diagram of the system , which is sensitive to tiny energy splittings between the different solutions of the bcs pairing problem .",
    "explication of the complete superfluid phase diagram of neutron matter has two facets .",
    "first , one must identify and characterize the set of admissible solutions of the bcs gap equations arising in the @xmath0p@xmath1@xmath0f@xmath1 pairing problem , i.e. , one must find the `` spectrum of solutions . ''",
    "second , one must determine the relative stability of the different solutions under variation of density , temperature , and other relevant parameters , so as to uncover the possible phase transitions and map out the actual phase diagram .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present a detailed account of the substantial progress that has been made on the first of these tasks through application of the separation method developed in ref .",
    "@xcite for robust and accurate solution of bcs gap equations .",
    "( the reader may consult ref .",
    "@xcite for a comprehensive review of the separation approach . )",
    "many of the results obtained here have been exposed in condensed form in earlier works @xcite ; it is our intent here to offer a more complete justification of these findings , and to provide an enhanced understanding of their wider implications .    in the separation method ,",
    "the bcs system is recast so as to isolate the major , logarithmically divergent contributions to the pairing effect and treat them separately from the remaining features of the problem , which are very insensitive to the presence of the gap and its particular value .",
    "this method , which in essence reduces the problem to solution of system of algebraic equations , is equally reliable and precise in the limiting regimes @xmath20 and @xmath21 , as well as in between . in concrete calculations",
    ", we may accommodate and exploit the fact , based on the experimental @xmath22-scattering phases @xcite , that the central components of the in - vacuum @xmath11 interaction nearly compensate each other .",
    "assume _  quite plausibly  that this feature is maintained by the _ effective _ @xmath11 interaction within neutron matter .",
    "we furthermore assume  with less confidence  that the smallness of the parameter characterizing the importance of the tensor force relative to the spin - orbit force is maintained in dense neutron matter .",
    "it must be acknowledged that medium modification may be more significant in the case of the tensor force than it is for the spin - orbit component , especially in the vicinity of the phase transition leading to pion condensation @xcite .",
    "investigation of this issue calls for a concerted effort and will be pursued elsewhere .",
    "the current study of the @xmath0p@xmath1@xmath0f@xmath1 model is exhaustive in its assembly of the set of solutions whose structural expression involves only real numbers .",
    "the implementation of this program requires no numerical computations ; remarkably , everything can be done analytically . in principle , the same method can be readily applied to the determination of complex solutions . however , this more complicated problem inevitably entails some computer work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .  2 ,",
    "the coupled - channel bcs formalism is stated , the separation method is applied to the gap equations , and further analysis establishes the explicit equations of an incisive perturbative treatment of the @xmath0p@xmath1@xmath0f@xmath1 pairing model . in sec .  3 ,",
    "the parametric degeneracy inherent in the unperturbed @xmath0p@xmath1 problem is lifted , and all real solutions of the perturbed model are found .",
    "section 4 furnishes a convenient and succinct catalog of these solutions .",
    "finally , sec .  5",
    "is devoted to a discussion of potential vulnerabilities of our approach to the @xmath0p@xmath1@xmath0f@xmath1 problem in neutron matter , as well as informative connections with aspects of triplet pairing in liquid @xmath0he .",
    "fixing the spin and isospin of the pairing state at @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( triplet - triplet ) , we start with the partial - wave decomposition @xmath25 of the @xmath26 gap matrix in terms of the spin - angle matrices @xmath27 and the multi - channel bcs gap equations @xmath28 that embrace the formal problem to be solved @xcite .",
    "the latter equations contain the spin trace @xmath29\\ ] ] and the interaction matrix elements @xmath30 appearing in the partial - wave expansion @xmath31 of the block of feynman diagrams irreducible in the particle - particle channel .",
    "the quasiparticle energy @xmath32^{1\\over 2 } \\label{qen}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is assembled from the single - particle spectrum @xmath33 of the normal fermi liquid , measured relative to the chemical potential @xmath34 and often parametrized with an effective mass @xmath35 , together with the gap components @xmath36 .",
    "we note that @xmath37 takes on an angular dependence by virtue of the spin trace @xmath38 , which in principle greatly complicates the task of solving the system ( [ bc ] ) .",
    "however , this angular dependence only comes into play near the fermi surface ; hence it can be ignored in those integral contributions to the r.h.s .  of eq .",
    "( [ bc ] ) in which the region around the fermi surface is suppressed @xcite . consequently , in practice the gap equations approximately decouple in the variables @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , by virtue of the orthogonality property @xmath42 treatment of the exact , coupled equations ( [ bc ] ) is therefore not as difficult as it appears at first sight ( though still not at all trivial ) .    the angle dependence of the function @xmath43 makes it awkward to speak of _ the _ energy gap .",
    "therefore it is conventional to introduce the quantity @xmath44^{1/2 } \\label{egap}\\ ] ] as a representative measure of the pairing gap in the quasiparticle spectrum , where the overbar signifies an angle average .",
    "as we have argued in the introduction , the spin - orbit component of the neutron - neutron interaction exerts a strong influence on pair formation in dense neutron matter , favoring the condensation of pairs in the @xmath0p@xmath1 state . accepting this widely held view , the simplifying feature just revealed implies that contributions to triplet pairing from nondiagonal terms with @xmath45 or @xmath46 on the r.h.s .  of eq .",
    "( 1 ) can be evaluated within perturbation theory .",
    "defining @xmath47 , the relevant coupling parameter is @xmath48 .",
    "the evaluation is carried out in terms of the set of `` principal '' gap amplitudes @xmath49 , with @xmath50 running from @xmath51 to 2 .",
    "a further simplification ensues from time - reversal invariance , which implies that only three of these five quantities can be independent , say @xmath49 with @xmath52 .    focusing on the nondiagonal contributions to the r.h.s .  of eq .",
    "( 1 ) , we observe that two of them are of leading significance .",

    "the list of participating states appears to be exhausted upon addition of the @xmath0p@xmath55 and @xmath0p@xmath56 pairing channels , which are deemed to be of lesser importance ; their role will be examined later in this paper .",
    "adopting the @xmath0p@xmath1@xmath0f@xmath1 pairing model as circumscribed above , the bcs system ( [ bc ] ) takes the explicit form @xmath57 which will now be subjected to analysis and solution . in writing the r.h.s .  of this equation ,",
    "we have replaced the quasiparticle energy @xmath58 by + @xmath59^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath60 is the gap function of the much - studied @xmath0p@xmath1 pairing model in which the tensor coupling between @xmath61 and @xmath22 states is ignored .",
    "the substitution @xmath62 in the integrals on the right is justified by the small relative size of the quantities @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 .",
    "a conspicuous feature of the @xmath0p@xmath1 pairing model is the high parametric degeneracy of the spectrum of its solutions .",
    "this property has been investigated in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite in terms of the two ratios @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the degeneracy is reflected in the existence of a set of curves @xmath68 in the plane @xmath69 , upon which all the bcs equations of the @xmath0p@xmath1 problem are satisfied . as we shall see , this degeneracy is essentially lifted in the @xmath0p@xmath1@xmath0f@xmath1 pairing model where @xmath70 . a finite set of points @xmath69 , depending somehow on the @xmath71 value , replaces the set of solution curves @xmath68 of the @xmath0p@xmath1 model .",
    "it is the objective of this article to identify the different solutions of the system ( [ bc1 ] ) and to establish their structure in the realistic case of small @xmath71 .",
    "the analysis is aided by the fact that the parameters @xmath72 and @xmath73 are _ continuous functions _ of the coupling constant @xmath71 .",
    "this property implies that the number of solutions of the @xmath0p@xmath1@xmath0f@xmath1 pairing problem as well as their structure remains the same no matter how small @xmath71 is .",
    "consequently , implementation of our program reduces to determination of the functions @xmath74 and @xmath75 at @xmath76 , i.e. , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "it then becomes apparent that the quasiparticle energy @xmath79 may be replaced by @xmath80 on the left - hand - sides of eqs .",
    "( [ bc1 ] ) as well as on the right , since taking into account the difference @xmath79 and @xmath80 within ( [ bc1 ] ) can not , by itself , lift the parametric degeneracy .",
    "this conclusion is confirmed in the numerical calculations we have performed .",
    "the nondiagonal integrals on the r.h.s .  of eqs .",

    "the magnetic dipole interaction between the @xmath0he atoms  which is responsible for such a phase separation close to @xmath8  triggers the planar state with @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "this result is unaffected by strong - coupling corrections .",
    "let us now turn to a more detailed analysis of the impact of transitions between pairing states .",

    "as will now be argued , this property holds in an extended version that allows for transitions between states with different @xmath7 values . upon setting @xmath218 in the equations ( [ bi ] ) and ( [ rhsr ] ) determining @xmath139 and @xmath140 , there apparently remains a single term containing @xmath242 .",
    "but upon closer inspection of the integrands in ( [ corr ] ) , this term is also found to vanish . according to eq .",
    "( [ ko ] ) , @xmath243 is an even function of @xmath147 independently of @xmath106 , while @xmath244 , the explicit form of which is given in the appendix , is an odd function of @xmath147 .",
    "nullification of the respective integrals therefore occurs upon integration over @xmath150 .",
    "consequently , the equality @xmath245 applies even when the transitions @xmath0p@xmath235p@xmath56 are incorporated into the description .",
    "it follows that the spectrum ( [ two ] ) of the two - component solutions of the @xmath0p@xmath1@xmath0f@xmath1 pairing model endures upon inclusion of the @xmath0p@xmath235p@xmath55 and @xmath0p@xmath235p@xmath56 transitions .",
    "the opposite situation is encountered when one considers the particular solution of the @xmath0p@xmath1@xmath0f@xmath1 pairing model defined by the straight line @xmath128 .",
    "the single point @xmath246 of this line does survive as a solution of the pairing problem , but the other points do not . to confirm this assertion",

    "( [ intk ] ) .",
    "it can be checked that this expression has no new zeroes on the straight line @xmath128 in addition to the point @xmath218 .",
    "close inspection reveals that the revised locations of the other solutions found above depend on the matrix elements of the interaction @xmath234 ; if the ratio @xmath253 is small then the shifts from the old positions are also small .",
    "naturally it is of interest to trace the trajectories of solutions as this ratio is varied , thereby exploring the phenomenon of triplet pairing in the continuum of cases from that of dense neutron matter to that of superfluid @xmath0he .",
    "this investigation will be a subject of future work .",
    "our method is to be compared with ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory , which is generally regarded as the standard technique for mapping the spectrum of the phases of systems with triplet pairing . in the gl method ,",
    "the search for diverse phases is based on the construction of a suitable free energy functional up to terms of fourth ( or even sixth ) power in the gap value @xmath254 .",
    "this approach allows one to simultaneously evaluate the splitting between the different phases and efficiently determine the phase diagram .",
    "another advantage of the gl procedure resides in the facility of including strong - coupling corrections @xcite arising from the dependence of the effective interaction @xmath234 on the gap value , an effect that becomes important close to the critical temperature @xmath8 .",
    "unfortunately , the gl method fails when the temperature @xmath233 is significantly different from @xmath8 .",
    "its application to the phase - spectrum problem makes a sense only if the phase structure of superfluid neutron matter is independent of @xmath233 .",
    "however , special conditions must be met for this to be true in the face of the explicit appearance of the factor @xmath255 in the set of bcs equations , and the explication of these conditions is impossible within the gl approach itself .",
    "our method is free of these shortcomings .",
    "it is equally reliable close to @xmath8 and at @xmath256 .",
    "moreover , the incorporation of strong - coupling corrections reduces to the insertion of new terms in @xmath234 that depend on @xmath254 itself ; if this dependence is appropriately specified , no further hurdles must be overcome to fully elucidate the triplet superfluid phase diagram .    in a sequel to this paper , we shall report the findings of a quantitative treatment of the transitions between the phases arising in the @xmath0p@xmath1@xmath0f@xmath1 model and construct the corresponding superfluid phase diagram of dense neutron matter .",
