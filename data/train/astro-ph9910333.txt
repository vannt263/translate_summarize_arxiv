    "the central regions of spiral galaxies do not form and evolve in isolation .",
    "observations indicate that tidal interactions ( e.g. barnes & hernquist 1992 and references therein ) can trigger the transport of material from disks to the central regions of galaxies , while bar instabilities ( e.g. ho , filippenko , & sargent 1997 and references therein ) , which may dissolve to form bulge - like structures ( e.g. norman , sellwood , & hasan 1996 ) , can transport material to small galactic radii . moreover , if galaxies form in a hierarchal manner , as is required to match the integrated light density of the universe as a function of redshift ( e.g. madau , pozzetti , & dickinson 1998 ) , then the bulges of spiral galaxies will almost certainly accumulate stars spanning a range of chemical compositions and ages from other systems .",
    "nearby spiral galaxies are important laboratories for studying bulge evolution .",
    "the galaxy is of particular interest as the age of the bulge can be measured directly from the brightness of the main sequence turn - off , and the presence of metal - rich bulge globular clusters ( minniti 1995 ) with halo - like ages ( ortolani et al .",
    "1995 , fullton et al .",
    "1995 ) indicates that at least some portions of the galactic bulge formed during early epochs .",
    "however , the galactic bulge may not consist exclusively of old stars .",
    "andredakis , peletier , & balcells ( 1995 ) find a smooth change in the central structural characteristics of spiral galaxies with hubble type , suggesting that interactions with the disk have progressively greater impact on the central properties of galaxies with later morphological types ; hence , it might be anticipated that the contribution of younger stars to the light from the central regions of galaxies will increase towards later morphological types .",
    "the structural characteristics of bulges may also change with morphological type .",
    "phillips et al .",
    "( 1996 ) find that the central surface brightness profiles of spiral galaxies undergo a change near type sc ( phillips et al .",
    "1996 ) , in the sense that the bulges of systems earlier than type sc appear to be related to early - type galaxies , while the bulges of systems later than type sc appear to be structurally similar to nucleated dwarf galaxies .",
    "these data suggest that the central light concentrations in sc galaxies may be transitional objects , with characteristics bridging earlier and later morphological types .",
    "thus , studies of sc galaxies may provide important insight into the physical processes that determine bulge evolution .",
    "this is the first in a series of papers dealing with high angular resolution near - infrared observations of the central regions of nearby sc galaxies obtained with the cfht aob .",
    "the near - infrared is of interest for studies of this nature since the light at these wavelengths originates mainly from old and intermediate - age populations , which formed when the structural characteristics of the central regions of the host systems were imprinted .",
    "the contribution of line and continuum emission to the total light output is also smaller in the near - infrared than at visible wavelengths , thereby simplifying efforts to study stellar content .",
    "finally , angular resolutions approaching the diffraction limit of the cfht can be obtained with the aob at these wavelengths .    with a distance modulus @xmath4 ( van den bergh 1991 )",
    ", m33 is a logical starting point for a study of the central regions of sc galaxies .",
    "the surface brightness profile of m33 departs from an exponential near the galaxy center ( e.g. kent 1987 , bothun 1992 , regan & vogel 1994 ) , indicating that the central light concentration is structurally distinct from the disk .",
    "bothun ( 1992 ) suggests that the central light concentration may be the inner extension of the halo , although this conclusion is based in part on data having relatively coarse angular resolution .",
    "in fact , images with subarcsec resolution reveal that the central light concentration contains a blue nucleus ( kormendy & mcclure 1993 , mighell & rich 1995 , lauer et al 1998 ) .",
    "the nucleus is very compact , and at ultraviolet wavelengths 50% of the nuclear light falls within the central 0.14 arcsec ( dubus , long , & charles 1999 ) .",
    "the central light concentration is slightly flattened ( lauer et al . 1998 ) , and has an extremely high surface density , such that the innermost regions have likely experienced core collapse ( kormendy & mcclure 1993 , lauer et al . 1998 ) .",
    "there are indications that m33 may harbour an active nucleus .",
    "rubin & ford ( 1986 ) detected [ nii ] emission in the nuclear spectrum , while matthews et al .",
    "( 1999 ) find what appears to be a jet originating from the nucleus .",
    "the nucleus also contains a bright x - ray source ( long et al .",
    "1981 ) which , although having a spectrum suggestive of low - level agn behaviour , may instead be an x - ray binary ( trinchieri , fabbiano & peres 1988 ) .",
    "the nucleus of m33 does not contain a super - massive black hole ( kormendy & mclure 1993 ) , and the absence of such an object means that the dynamical evolution of the central regions will be very different from systems like m31 or the milky - way ( lauer et al .",
    "finally , regan & vogel ( 1994 ) find evidence of a weak bar , which may have played a significant role in the recent evolution of the nucleus .",
    "given that star formation is occuring throughout the disk of m33 it is perhaps not surprising that the central regions of this galaxy contain young and intermediate - age components .",
    "spectroscopic investigations by oconnell ( 1983 ) and schmidt , bica , & alloin ( 1990 ) indicate that a substantial fraction of the visible light within a few arcsec of the galaxy center originates from stars with ages @xmath5 gyr , and that the most chemically evolved stars in this region have solar metallicities .",
    "gordon et al .",
    "( 1999 ) examine spectra covering a broad range of wavelengths and conclude that star formation in the nucleus has not been continuous , and that the most recent burst of star formation occured 70  75 myr in the past .",
    "gordon et al .",
    "also conclude that the central regions of m33 contain dust that follows an extinction curve like that in the milky - way .",
    "the presence of intermediate age stars near the center of m33 have been confirmed by imaging studies .",
    "minniti , olszewski , & rieke ( 1993 ) used near - infrared images to detect stars as luminous as m@xmath6 near the galaxy center , although subsequent observations by mclean & liu ( 1996 ) , who studied the near - infrared properties of stars with distances in excess of 45 arcsec from the nucleus to avoid crowding , suggest that the brightest objects in the minniti et al . sample may be blends of fainter stars .",
    "mclean & liu ( 1996 ) found a discontinuity in the luminosity function ( lf ) near m@xmath7 , which was interpreted as the agb - tip of a population with an age of @xmath8 gyr .",
    "the highest angular resolution investigation of resolved stars near the center of m33 was conducted by mighell & rich ( 1995 ) using archival @xmath9 and @xmath10 wfpc1 images .",
    "these data revealed a large population of blue main sequence stars , which are less centrally concentrated than the old and intermediate - age components .",
    "giant branch stars were also resolved , and the width of the rgb suggests that the inner regions of m33 experienced a chemical enrichment history that is very different from the outer halo field studied by mould & kristian ( 1986 ) .    in summary ,",
    "the existing data indicate that the central regions of m33 contain a mixture of stellar populations , spanning a range of ages and metallicities .",
    "crowding has presented a significant obstacle for efforts to probe the regions in and around the central light concentration , and in the current study near - infrared images with @xmath11 arcsec angular resolution are used to investigate the stellar content within 18 arcsec of the galaxy center .",
    "details of the observations and the methods used to reduce the data are described in  2 , while the near - infrared photometric properties of resolved stars in the circumnuclear region are discussed in  3 .",
    "the stellar content of the central light concentration is investigated in  4 , and a discussion and summary of the results follows in  5 .",
    "the data were obtained during the night of ut sept 6/7 1998 with the kir imager , which contains a @xmath12 hg : cd : te array with 0.034 arcsec pixels , and cfht ao system ( rigaut et al .",
    "images were recorded through @xmath13 co , and @xmath14 m continuum filters with the galaxy nucleus centered on the detector ; the nucleus also served as the reference source for ao compensation .",
    "four groups of five exposures were recorded in each filter , with the telescope offset after each group to form a @xmath15 arcsec dither pattern .",
    "the total integration time was 20 minutes per filter , except for co , where the total exposure time was 40 minutes .",
    "the fwhm of individual stellar images is 0.34 arcsec in all filters .",
    "calibration frames were constructed using the procedures described by davidge & courteau ( 1999 ) .",
    "the raw data were corrected for detector dark count , flat - field variations , dc sky level , and thermal emission from objects along the optical path .",
    "the results were aligned on a filter - by - filter basis to correct for the offsets introduced at the telescope , and then median - combined to reject cosmic rays and bad pixels .",
    "the final @xmath16 image is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the @xmath17 and @xmath18 images are very similar to the @xmath16 image , and hence are not shown here .",
    "stars are resolved over much of the kir field , and the brightnesses of these were measured using the psf - fitting routine allstar ( stetson & harris 1988 ) .",
    "photometric measurements are complicated by the surface - brightness distribution of m33 , which changes significantly on sub - arcsec angular scales near the galaxy center , thereby making it difficult to measure local sky levels .",
    "this background structure was removed using the iterative technique described by davidge , le fvre , & clark ( 1991 ) .",
    "a single psf was constructed for each filter using routines in the daophot ( stetson 1987 ) photometry package .",
    "while isoplanicity causes the psf to vary with distance from the galaxy center , which served as the reference source for ao compensation , the star - subtracted images produced by allstar do not show obvious systematic residuals indicative of radial psf variations .",
    "moreover , observations of globular clusters have shown that during typical seeing conditions psf variations over the kir field do not affect photometric measurements by more than a few percent ( davidge 1999 , davidge & courteau 1999 ) .",
    "standard stars from casali & hawarden ( 1992 ) and elias et al .",
    "( 1982 ) were observed throughout the 4 night observing run , and photometric zeropoints were computed from the resulting images .",
    "the uncertainty in the zeropoints is typically @xmath19 mag .",
    "the brightnesses and colors of stars with @xmath20 are listed in table 1 .",
    "the @xmath21 and @xmath22 entries in this table are offsets , in pixels , from the center of m33 in the reference frame defined by figure 1 , which is 1000 pixels on a side .",
    "positive offsets are to the west and north .      the @xmath23 and @xmath16 lfs of the circumnuclear region are shown in figure 2 .",
    "the lfs follow power - laws at the bright end , and the drop in number counts at the faint end indicates that incompleteness becomes significant at @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath26 and @xmath0 cmds , shown in figure 3 , contain a plume of stars extending from @xmath27 to @xmath28 .",
    "the scatter in the two cmds is similar , amounting to @xmath29 mag and @xmath30 mag between @xmath31 and 18 .",
    "@xmath32 is more sensitive to variations in age and metallicity than @xmath33 , so this similarity in scatter suggests that observational errors , rather than the intrinsic properties of stars , dominant the dispersion along the color axes .    the statistical uncertainties in the photometric measurements have also been estimated with artificial star experiments .",
    "artificial stars with colors and brightnesses that follow the locus of points on the cmds were added to the @xmath23 and @xmath16 images using the daophot task addstar , and the brightnesses of the added stars were then measured with allstar .",
    "the standard deviations of the difference between the measured and actual brightnesses were computed , and the results were used to generate the error bars plotted in figure 3 .",
    "the uncertainties estimated in this manner are in reasonable agreement with the scatter on the cmds , providing further evidence that observational errors are the dominant source of scatter .    at the distance of m33 the rgb - tip for an old solar metallicity population",
    "would be expected to occur near @xmath34 , and a significant number of stars brighter than this have been detected near the center of m33 .",
    "crowding is a major concern in high - density environments , as spurious bright objects are produced when two or more moderately faint stars fall within the same resolution element .",
    "therefore , the possibility that the sources with @xmath35 may not be individual stars must be investigated .",
    "if the circumnuclear region consists exclusively of an old population like that in metal - rich galactic globular clusters then objects significantly brighter than @xmath34 will be the result of two ( or more ) giants within @xmath36 mag of the rgb - tip occuring in the same resolution element .",
    "ngc6316 is a moderately metal - rich globular cluster that was observed by davidge et al .",
    "( 1992 ) in @xmath16 , and the results from that study can be used to assess the effects of blending in the current dataset .",
    "davidge et al .",
    "( 1992 ) found 4 stars in the top 0.5 mag interval of the ngc6316 giant branch in @xmath16 over a field covering the cluster half mass radius ; hence , ngc6316 likely contains @xmath37 stars in the top 0.5 mag of the giant branch .",
    "the surface brightness of m33 10 arcsec from the galaxy center is @xmath38 mag / arcsec@xmath39 ( kent 1987 ) , so that each 0.34 arcsec wide resolution element samples a population with m@xmath40 if @xmath41 . given that the integrated brightness of ngc6316 is m@xmath42 ( harris 1996 ) then , if the center of m33 is dominated by an old moderately metal - rich population , each kir resolution element should contain @xmath43 upper giant branch stars .",
    "the probability of having two such stars in one resolution element is then @xmath44 , so that there will be roughly 9 objects with @xmath45 that are the result of blends in the current dataset . for comparison ,",
    "more than 300 objects brighter than @xmath27 have been detected .",
    "the incidence of blends plummets when k @xmath46 ; for example , a blend of 4 rgb - tip stars is required to produce an object with @xmath47 , and the probability of this occuring is @xmath48 , so that there would be 0.006 such objects per kir field .",
    "thus , the central regions of m33 contain stars that are brighter than would be expected from an old moderately metal - rich population .",
    "neither the peak brightness nor mean color of the cmd ridgeline varies across the kir field .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure 4 , where the @xmath0 cmds of stars in 3 annuli , centered on the m33 nucleus , are plotted .",
    "the absence of a correlation between peak stellar brightness and distance from the galaxy center provides further evidence that the brightest sources are individual stars , and not blends .",
    "the @xmath49 cmds of stars near the center of m33 are compared with large and small magellanic cloud red supergiants ( rsgs ) and long period variables ( lpvs ) from the studies of elias , frogel , & humphreys ( 1985 ) and wood , bessell , & fox ( 1983 ) in figure 5 .",
    "the rsgs define a vertical plume on the cmd , and the corresponding portion of the m33 cmd is unoccupied .",
    "however , the m33 data overlap with the magellanic cloud lpv observations , although the latter dataset contains stars that are almost 2 mag brighter than the brightest m33 stars . hence , the recent star forming histories of the inner disk of m33 and the magellanic clouds have been very different .",
    "the sequence defined by m giants in baade s window ( bw ) , which is also plotted in figures 3 and 4 , falls to the right of the m33 data , ostensibly suggesting that stars surrounding the central light concentration may be more metal - poor than those in bw",
    ". however , m33 contains stars that are intrinsically brighter than those in bw , indicating a difference in ages , which will in turn affect giant branch colors .",
    "in fact , the near - infrared spectral - energy distributions ( seds ) of stars in m33 and bw are not significantly different .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure 6 , which shows the @xmath50 two - color diagram ( tcd ) for stars with @xmath51 . to reduce scatter on the tcd ,",
    "mean colors were computed in @xmath52 mag intervals along the @xmath16 axis of the @xmath26 and @xmath0 cmds , and the points plotted in figure 6 are based on these means .",
    "the m33 points lie between the solar neighborhood and bw giant sequences in figure 6 and , with @xmath53 mag uncertainties in the color calibrations , the m33 data are not significantly different from the bw sequence .",
    "davidge ( 1998b ) used the solar metallicity models of bertelli et al .",
    "( 1994 ) to generate near - infrared agb sequences .",
    "these sequences are compared with the m33 observations in figure 5 , and it is evident that most of the stars detected near the center of m33 have an age between 1 and 10 gyr , while there are few stars with ages between 0.1 and 1 gyr .",
    "the colors of theoretical sequences on cmds are sensitive to uncertain quantities such as the mixing length and the relation between color and effective temperature used to tranform stellar structure models onto the observational plane .",
    "the bolometric lf provides a more direct means of investigating the ages of stellar populations .",
    "bolometric luminosities were computed for stars near the center of m33 using the relations between the bolometric correction , bc@xmath54 , and @xmath32 for solar neighborhood and bw giants from figure 1b of frogel & whitford ( 1987 ) .",
    "the resulting lfs , which are compared in the upper panel of figure 7 , are almost identical , and follow a power - law from m@xmath55 to the onset of incompleteness at m@xmath56 .",
    "the power - law exponent , derived from a least squares fit to the 4 lf bins with m@xmath57 between 5 and 3.5 , is @xmath58 .",
    "discontinuities in the lf near the bright end are one indication that the recent star forming history near the center of m33 has not been continuous .",
    "the lf in figure 7 appears to depart from the trend infered from moderately faint bins when m@xmath59 , which is the agb - tip luminosity for a population with an age log(t ) = 9.2 @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is in gyr , according to the solar metallicity bertelli et al .",
    "( 1994 ) models .",
    "the significance of this departure from the least squares fit shown in figure 7 is investigated in figure 8 , where the differences between the observed and predicted numbers of stars in each lf bin and the ratio of these differences to the estimated uncertainties , which provides a direct measure of statistical significance , are plotted .",
    "it is evident from the lower panel of figure 8 that the difference between the observations and the least squares fit is significant at the @xmath62 level or higher when m@xmath63 , indicating that a significant break in the lf occurs when m@xmath64 .",
    "the presence of such a break indicates that the majority of agb stars with m@xmath65 have ages 1  3 gyr , and that star forming activity declined @xmath66 gyr in the past ; consequently , the star formation rate near the center of m33 has not been constant during the last few gyr .",
    "minniti et al .",
    "( 1993 ) note that the lf of stars near the center of m33 is similar to that of the galactic center , and in the lower panel of figure 7 the bolometric lfs for stars near the centers of m33 and the galaxy are compared .",
    "the galactic lf was constructed from the observations of the field surrounding sgra obtained by davidge ( 1998a ) .",
    "it is apparent that the m33 and galactic lfs have very similar power - law exponents in the interval @xmath67 m@xmath68 .",
    "kormendy & mcclure ( 1993 ) and lauer et al . ( 1998 ) found that the nucleus of m33 is bluer than the surroundings at visible wavelengths . to determine",
    "if this is also the case in the infrared , mean @xmath32 , @xmath33 , co , and br@xmath69 values were computed in 0.1 arcsec wide annuli centered on the m33 nucleus , and the results are shown in figure 9 .",
    "the background sky level , which is of critical importance for measuring colors in low surface - brightness regions , can not be reliably measured from the kir data given the extended nature of m33 .",
    "although a blank sky field 1 degree from the galaxy center was observed immediately following the m33 observations , the sky brightness at infrared wavelengths can change significantly over time scales of a few minutes and angular offsets of a few arcmin . rather than rely on potentially uncertain",
    "sky measurements from the offset field , background sky levels for each filter were computed by assuming that the surface brightness profile near the center of m33 follows an r@xmath70 profile , as indicated by observations at visible wavelengths ( e.g bothun 1992 , regan & vogel 1994 ) .",
    "this profile was fit to the data between 1 and 3.5 arcsec from the galaxy center to satisfy the conflicting requirements of avoiding contamination from the bright nucleus while maintaining an acceptably high s / n ratio for surface brightness measurements .",
    "it should be emphasized that the color measurements have been restricted to the central 1.5 arcsec of m33 , where the surface brightness is high and photometric measurements are insensitive to the adopted sky levels .",
    "the @xmath32 and @xmath33 profiles in figure 9 indicate that the nucleus is bluer than the surroundings , in qualitative agreement with the kormendy & mcclure ( 1993 ) and lauer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) measurements .",
    "the co index strengthens with decreasing radius , reaching 0.24 within 0.1 arcsec of the nucleus , indicating that a significant population of bright cool stars is present near the center of m33 .",
    "gordon et al .",
    "( 1999 ) used @xmath71 m spectra obtained during 1 arcsec seeing to estimate the co index within 0.6 arcsec of the center of m33 , and found that co = 0.21 . to determine",
    "if the current data produce a similar result , the co and continuum images were convolved with a gaussian to simulate 1 arcsec fwhm seeing .",
    "the co index within a 1.2 arcsec aperture was then measured , with the result that co = 0.21 .",
    "thus , the current co measurements are consistent with the gordon et al .",
    "( 1999 ) result .",
    "the radial br@xmath69 profile in figure 9 is suggestive of strengthening absorption towards smaller radii in the pass band of the br@xmath69 filter .",
    "the nucleus of m33 has a very early spectral type ( van den bergh 1976 ) with strong h@xmath72 absorption ( e.g. rubin & ford 1986 ) , and it is tempting to interpret the radial br@xmath69 profile in the context of very strong nuclear br@xmath69 absorption .",
    "however , the near - infrared photometric properties of the m33 nucleus indicate that bright red stars are present ( see above ) , and it is not clear if strong br@xmath69 absorption would result in such a situation .",
    "other species , such as cn , which is prominent in carbon star spectra at these wavelengths ( e.g. davidge 1990 ) , could dominate the br@xmath69 filter pass band near the nucleus .",
    "high angular resolution spectroscopy covering br@xmath69 would be of interest to determine the cause of the radial variation in the br@xmath69 index .",
    "@xmath50 and @xmath73 tcds provide insight into the stellar content of the nucleus and the surrounding central light concentration .",
    "these tcds for the central regions of m33 are shown in in figure 10 , where the plotted points are the normals calculated in  4.1 .",
    "frogel ( 1985 ) measured the central colors of nearby sc galaxies through a 6.6 arcsec diameter aperture .",
    "these measurements are plotted in figure 10 , and it is evident that they overlap with the m33 datapoints that sample the outer parts of the central light concentration .",
    "the agreement is best on the @xmath73 tcd , where the frogel ( 1985 ) data continue the sequence defined by the m33 observations .",
    "this comparison indicates that the colors and co indices measured for m33 are consistent with those seen in other systems .",
    "also plotted in figure 10 are datapoints for m31 globular clusters ( frogel , persson , & cohen 1980 ) and open clusters in the magellanic clouds ( persson et al .",
    "the cluster and m33 data occupy similar regions of the tcds , indicating that the near - infrared light from the central few arcsec of m33 is mainly stellar in origin .",
    "the @xmath73 tcd is of particular interest as magellanic cloud clusters of searle , wilkinson , & bagnuolo ( 1980 ; hereafter swb ) types 1 and 2 define a distinct sequence on this diagram , in the sense of having relatively strong co absorption coupled with moderately blue @xmath32 colors .",
    "the photometric properties of swb type 1 and 2 clusters can be understood in the context of age : they are among the youngest in the magellanic clouds ( e.g. hodge 1983 ) and the strong co indices originate from very luminous agb - tip stars ( frogel , mould , & blanco 1990 ) , while the blue broad - band colors are a consequence of relatively hot giant branch temperatures , combined with a bright , blue , main sequence turn off .",
    "the nucleus of m33 has @xmath74 and co = 0.25 , whereas at larger radii co = 0.05 and @xmath75 .",
    "it is evident from the lower panel of figure 10 that the photometric characteristics of the nucleus are reminiscent of swb types 1 and 2 clusters , while at distances in excess of 0.4 arcsec from the nucleus , the m33 datapoints coincide with those of m31 globular clusters and magellanic cloud clusters with later swb classifications . given that swb types 1 and 2 clusters are much younger than m31 globular clusters , these data thus suggest that the color gradient near the center of m33 is due at least in part to age effects , in the sense that there is a relatively young nucleus surrounded by older stars .",
    "a young stellar population is present in the sgra complex ( davidge et al .",
    "1997 and references therein ) , and massey et al .",
    "( 1996 ) speculate that the nucleus of m33 may contain a population of hot stars similar to those in sgra .",
    "it is clearly of interest to compare the near - infrared photometric properties of the m33 nucleus and the galactic center . to conduct such a comparison ,",
    "the wide - field mosaiced images of sgra and environs obtained by davidge ( 1998a ) were block - averaged to reproduce the spatial sampling obtained by aob+kir at the distance of m33 , and the results were convolved with the psfs constructed for the photometric analysis in  3 .",
    "the background sky levels for the galactic center data were fixed so that the @xmath71 m light profile followed that plotted in figure 1 of saha , bicknell , & mcgregor ( 1996 ) .",
    "following the procedure described in  4.1 , @xmath32 and co were measured in the block - averaged and seeing - convolved sgra images by radially averaging these quantities in 0.1 arcsec wide annuli , and the results are shown in figure 11 .",
    "the data plotted in this figure have not been corrected for extinction and , aside from a constant offset due to differences between the mean extinctions of the two fields , the @xmath32 and co profiles for sgra are very different from those of the central regions of m33 , in the sense that weaker co absorption and larger @xmath32 colors are seen with decreasing radius near sgra . while there is a known co deficiency in the vicinity of sgra * ( e.g. haller et al .",
    "1996 , sellgren et al .",
    "1990 ) , this is restricted to the central 8 arcsec of the galaxy , which corresponds to 0.08 arcsec at the distance of m33 .",
    "hence , the depressed co level in figure 11 , which occurs over much larger angular scales , likely has a different origin .",
    "the extinction towards the galactic center is not uniform , and the near - infrared colors of individual stars suggest that a@xmath54 may reach a local maximum of @xmath76 mag within 40 arcsec of the galactic center , which corresponds to @xmath77 arcsec at the distance of m33 , with a@xmath78 mag in the surrounding areas ( davidge 1998a ) . both @xmath32 and co would be affected by significant amounts if a@xmath54 changed by 0.3 mag .",
    "in particular , a 0.3 mag decrease in a@xmath54 would increase @xmath32 by 0.5 mag , and lower co by 0.04 mag ; hence , a radial extinction gradient like that proposed by davidge ( 1998a ) could contribute significantly to the @xmath32 and co profiles in figure 11 .    the nuclear co indices and @xmath32 colors of m33 and the galaxy at 0.1 arcsec radius are compared in table 2 .",
    "the de - reddened colors , shown in the last two columns , assume that @xmath79 for m33 , and a@xmath80 for sgra .",
    "the errors listed in this table assume a @xmath19 mag uncertainty in the photometric calibration , a @xmath81 mag uncertainty in a@xmath54 towards sgra , and a @xmath81 mag uncertainty in @xmath82 towards m33 .",
    "a solar neighborhood extinction curve has also been adopted .",
    "it is evident from table 2 that the co indices for m33 and sgra are in excellent agreement , while the @xmath32 values differ at roughly the @xmath83 level .",
    "while the difference between the @xmath32 colors is only marginally significant , it underlines the need to obtain integrated near - infrared spectra of the nucleus of m33 and the sgra complex to provide a firmer basis of comparison .",
    "near - infrared images with 0.3 arcsec angular resolution have been used to investigate the stellar content near the center of the local group sc galaxy m33 .",
    "the brightest resolved objects in the innermost regions of the m33 disk are luminous agb stars , and the sources detected with the current data are likely the infrared - bright stars studied by mighell & rich ( 1995 ) .",
    "the brightest agb stars in the inner disk of m33 are almost 2 mag fainter in @xmath16 than the brightest agb stars in the magellanic clouds and late - type spirals in the sculptor group ( davidge 1998b ) .",
    "the near - infrared seds of the m33 stars are characteristic of moderately metal - rich populations , as expected given that the metallicity of gas near the center of m33 , infered from studies of hii regions , is comparable to that in the solar neighborhood ( garnett et al .",
    "1997 , shaver et al .",
    "1983 ) .",
    "there is a break in the agb lf at m@xmath84 , suggesting that the star formation rate in the inner disk of m33 @xmath2 gyr in the past was elevated with respect to more recent epochs .",
    "mclean & liu ( 1996 ) also detected a discontinuity at this luminosity at larger distances from the galaxy center , indicating that this enhanced level of star formation occured over a significantly larger area than the kir field . while the absence of very luminous agb stars indicates that the star formation rate changed @xmath66 gyr in the past , the presence of blue main sequence stars ( mighell & rich 1995 ) indicates that recent star formation has occured in the innermost regions of the m33 disk .    if the statistics of bright giants in the moderately metal - rich globular cluster ngc6316 are assumed to hold for the inner disk of m33 then a significant fraction of the sources detected in the current study with @xmath85 ( i.e. near the rgb - tip ) may not be individual stars , but rather blends of fainter stars",
    "however , the situation is very different for objects brighter than @xmath27 .",
    "for example , a blend of 4 rgb - tip stars would be required to produce an object with k = 17 , and the chance of this happening in the kir field is negligible .",
    "if the brightest objects detected in the current study were blends of two or more faint stars then the peak stellar brightness should vary with distance from the center of m33 , and this is not seen .",
    "in fact , the agb - tip brightness in the innermost regions of the m33 disk appears to be similar to that seen at much larger radii , as is the case in late - type spirals in the sculptor group ( davidge 1998b ) .",
    "the near - infrared colors of the central light concentration , which is not resolved into stars with the current data , vary with distance from the galaxy center , in the sense that the nucleus is bluer than the surroundings .",
    "this trend is consistent with observations at visible wavelengths ( kormendy & mcclure 1993 , lauer et al .",
    "kormendy & mcclure ( 1993 ) and lauer et al . (",
    "1998 ) noted that the nucleus of m33 may have experienced core collapse , and that the blue population may be the result of stellar mergers .",
    "however , this explanation for the blue population is not without problems .",
    "for example , the collision time scale near the center of m32 is only @xmath86 lower than in m33 , and there is no evidence for a significant population of blue merger remnants near the center of the former galaxy ( lauer et al .",
    "1998 ) . indeed , gordon et al .",
    "( 1999 ) reinvestigated the incidence of mergers near the center of m33 and concluded that lauer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have likely overestimated the frequency of collisions .    a recent episode of star formation near the center of m33 appears to offer the most reasonable explanation for the blue nucleus .",
    "indeed , the near - infrared photometric characteristics of the nucleus are similar to those of young and intermediate - age star clusters .",
    "gordon et al .",
    "( 1999 ) note that the luminosity and spatial extent of the m33 nucleus is not greatly different from that of sgra , where there is a well - documented young population .",
    "the current data indicate that the nuclei of m33 and the galaxy , when viewed at the same spatial resolution , have comparable co indices , providing yet another way in which the central regions of these galaxies are similar .",
    "given the relativley low mass infered for the central black hole in m33 ( assuming that such an object is even present ) , then it appears that star formation in the central regions of spiral galaxies does not require the presence of a super massive compact object .",
    "the source of the gas that fueled the recent nuclear star formation in m33 is a matter of speculation .",
    "kormendy & mcclure ( 1993 ) point out that it would be difficult for gas from the disk of m33 to find the nucleus given the shallow gravitational potential .",
    "however , regan & vogel ( 1994 ) found a weak bar - like structure , which could serve as a conduit for channeling gas into the central regions of the galaxy .    aside from the blue nucleus",
    ", the central light concentration of m33 has a near - infrared sed similar to that of globular clusters .",
    "the metallicity of the central light concentration provides important clues into its origins , and the co index between 0.5 to 1.0 arcsec from the nucleus , where contamination from the central blue population should be small , is co@xmath87 , which is indicative of a low metallicity .",
    "davidge ( 1999 ) revised the relation between integrated co strength in globular clusters and metallicity originally investigated by aaronson et al .",
    "( 1978 ) , and this re - calibration predicts that [ m / h ] @xmath3 in the outer regions of the central light concentration , with an estimated uncertainty of 0.5 dex . while oconnell ( 1983 ) and schmidt et al .",
    "( 1990 ) both conclude that a large metal - rich component is present near the center of m33 , the data used in those investigations were recorded through relatively large apertures , so there is significant contamination from the inner disk ; consequently , the metallicities infered from these studies do not necessarily apply to the central light concentration .",
    "a low metallicity for the m33 central light concentration is perhaps not surprising given the empirical relation between chemical composition and bulge mass derived from spectroscopic studies of early - type spirals ( e.g. jablonka , martin , & arimoto 1996 ) .",
    "the metallicity of spheroidal systems depends on the local escape velocity ( e.g. franx & illingworth 1990 , davies , sadler , & peletier 1993 , martinelli , matteucci , & colafrancesco 1998 ) , and the modest velocity dispersion near the center of m33 indicates that the escape velocity in this region is lower than near the centers of larger spheroids , such as the bulge of m31 ; consequently , a significant difference in mean metallicity is to be expected .",
    "finally , a low metallicity suggests that the central light concentration could not have formed from chemically evolved disk material .",
    "the metallicity computed in the preceding paragraph assumes that the central light concentration is a simple stellar system , and colors measured at visible wavelengths provide a means of testing this assumption .",
    "kormendy & mcclure ( 1993 ) find that @xmath88 1 arcsec from the nucleus , which corresponds to @xmath89 if @xmath79 , while lauer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) find that @xmath90 when r @xmath91 arcsec , so that @xmath92 . for comparison , globular clusters typically have @xmath93 between 0.85 and 1.45 and @xmath94 between 0.7 and 1.0 ( reed , hesser , & shawl 1988 ) . hence , the visible colors of the central light concentration appear to be lower than those predicted for an old population , as expected if a young component , which could influnece the co index , is present",
    ". however , the amount of contamination from a young population , especially at infrared wavelengths , may be modest .",
    "moreover , the difference between the colors of the central light concentration and those of globular clusters is greatest for the kormendy & mcclure ( 1993 ) data , which have a markedly lower angular resolution than the present observations , and light from the blue nucleus will influence the @xmath93 colors from these data at sub - arcsec radii . instruments currently being developed for 8 metre telescopes will allow visible and near - infrared spectra with angular resolutions comparable to , and perhaps even surpassing , that of the current observations to be recorded of the center of m33 , and data of this nature will provide a powerful means of decoupling age and metallicity in the central light concentration .",
