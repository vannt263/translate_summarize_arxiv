    "the hard x - ray point source , with 1% the luminosity of the pwn and surrounded by small - scale ordered structure , is likely emission from the pulsar @xcite .",
    "we have searched this location for a radio pulsar , and in this letter report the discovery of , the central pulsar in snr  .",
    "we began our search for the pulsar in snr  at the atnf parkes telescope , where during 20022005 we used three combinations of search frequencies and filterbank data acquisition systems to do four very long observations ( see table  [ tab : obs ] ) .",
    "the @xcite ne2001 free electron distribution model predicts that in this direction , for @xmath27 , the expected dispersion measure would be @xmath28pc@xmath2 , and that the pulse broadening due to interstellar scattering at the standard search frequency of 1.4ghz would be @xmath29ms .",
    "given the possibility of larger actual dm and @xmath30 , one of our observations was at 3ghz .",
    "we analyzed all search data with standard pulsar search techniques implemented in presto @xcite , including the excision of radio frequency interference ( rfi ) and a nearly optimal set of trial dms ( for more details see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we dedispersed at up to twice the maximum galactic dm of 1580pc@xmath2 predicted by ne2001 in this direction .",
    "no new pulsars were detected in any of the parkes data sets .",
    "the parkes sensitivity limits at 1.4ghz correspond to luminosity @xmath31mjykpc@xmath32 , provided that scattering was not the limiting factor . at 3ghz , although the sky background temperature was reduced , any ordinary pulsar would have had an even more significantly reduced flux , and the equivalent luminosity limit was worse .",
    "since young pulsars can have luminosities at least as small as @xmath33mjykpc@xmath32 @xcite , we did a deeper search at the nrao green bank telescope ( gbt ) .    in 2006 january we observed  at the gbt at a central frequency of 1.95ghz using the spigot autocorrelation spectrometer @xcite .",
    "for a typical spectral index of @xmath34 @xcite , the pulsar would be fainter by a factor of about 1.7 by comparison with 1.4ghz . however , this was more than made up by the larger gain and bandwidth at the gbt , such that our observation was a factor of about 2 more sensitive than the best parkes search , both compared at the same fiducial frequency of 1.4ghz .",
    "in addition , by using a higher search frequency , the scattering timescale was reduced by a factor of about 4 , which proved crucial in light of the actual pulsar period and the amount of observed scattering .",
    "we identified in these data a highly dispersed ( @xmath35pc@xmath2 ) and scattered pulsar candidate with period @xmath36ms ( figure  [ fig : psr ] ) .",
    "it is a faint signal , with flux density @xmath37jy , compared to the detection threshold in this observation for a pulsar with these characteristics of approximately @xmath38jy .",
    "we confirmed the pulsar in an equivalent observation using the green bank ultimate pulsar processing instrument ( guppi ) on 2009 march 11 ( figure  [ fig : psr ] ) , for which @xmath39jy . in the presence of rfi , guppi , an fpga - based digital spectrometer ,",

    "we obtain @xmath45s , scaled to the usually reported frequency of 1ghz ( for @xmath46 in the range 3.64.4 , @xmath47 varies over 0.160.28s ) .",
    "this compares to @xmath48s predicted by @xcite for this dm and direction .",
    "the observed dm is biased by the large degree of scattering , and in our fitting process we obtain the corrected @xmath49 .",
    "a comparison of the barycentric periods for the discovery and confirmation observations ( table  [ tab : obs ] ) shows that the pulsar period increased by @xmath50s . the time interval between these observations was @xmath51 days ( mjd @xmath52 ) .",
    "the average period derivative is thus @xmath53 .",
    "the corresponding derived pulsar parameters are @xmath54 , @xmath55kyr , and surface magnetic dipole field strength @xmath56 g . for the observed dm , the ne2001 model yields @xmath57kpc , though with substantial uncertainty .",
    "has a magnetic field strength at its light cylinder of @xmath58 g , which is the seventh highest among pulsars known in the galactic disk .",
    "it has been suggested that @xmath59 is a controlling parameter for the emission of very narrow `` giant '' radio pulses @xcite , and among the four pulsars known to emit giant pulses , psr  b054069 , in the lmc , has the smallest value , @xmath60 g .",
    "therefore , in addition to the periodicity searches of the data listed in table  [ tab : obs ] ( we also did a more sensitive folding analysis of all the parkes data sets , using the subsequently determined values of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , but did not detect the pulsar ) , we carried out a search for dispersed individual pulses in the two gbt data sets .",
    "we used standard matched - filter techniques described in detail by @xcite and implemented in the sigproc pulsar search package .",
    "no single pulses were detected . however , our sensitivity was much degraded as a consequence of the large single - channel dispersion smearing ( 12ms ) and the huge scattering ( about 13ms at 2ghz ) , but for which we could easily have detected giant pulses like those observed from psr  b054069 by @xcite .",
    "is a rare young neutron star in that its spin - down luminosity is surpassed among known galactic pulsars only by the crab .",
    "we have estimated the chance probability of detecting such a pulsar in our search by simulating an inner - galactic gbt survey with individual 6hr spigot observations at 2ghz .",
    "considering the best population model of @xcite , we find that such a survey would detect one ordinary ( non - millisecond ) pulsar every 0.07deg@xmath32 .",
    "our beam area is 11% of this , which is also the probability of finding one such pulsar blindly . until now , only the crab was known with @xmath61among 1600 ordinary galactic pulsars .",
    "the probability of finding any such high @xmath62 pulsar by chance is thus @xmath63 .",
    "is also very distant , based on its large dm , as expected for the pulsar in snr  from the high @xmath64 to its pwn .",
    "the current positional uncertainty of  is @xmath65 , which is sufficient to locate it in projection within the  shell ( figure  [ fig : snr ] ) . within this area ,",
    "there are no radio or x - ray sources other than the  pwn that could plausibly account for a young pulsar with @xmath66 , despite the great sensitivity of existing vla , _ chandra x - ray observatory _ , and _ xmm - newton _ observations .",
    "there is therefore no doubt that  and  are associated .",
    "the electron density model is not well constrained toward the distant inner galactic regions ( see * ? ? ?",
    "prior to the discovery of , only nine pulsars were known with @xmath67 , of which only two are within 20 degrees of the galactic center ( gc ) , none with independently estimated distances @xcite .",
    "therefore , the ne2001 distance of 13kpc for  could be substantially in error .",
    "it is not excluded that the pulsar could be located at 89kpc , physically near the gc .",
    "however , given both the very large @xmath64 and dm , it is unlikely that the pulsar is located substantially closer than the gc .",
    "also , the ratio @xmath68 for  is higher than seen toward all but about four other pulsars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "gaensler et al .  argue that this indicates a location behind substantial intervening molecular material , which would not be surprising for a location near or beyond the gc .",
    "it is also intriguing that two pulsars located only 0.3 degrees in projection from the gc ( at a lateral distance of about 40pc if near it ) have @xmath69  @xcite , like , which among known pulsars is the third nearest to the gc in projection .",
    "the scattering timescale for those two pulsars is a factor of a few larger than for , but still very small compared to the levels expected if they were located within the scattering screen thought to surround the gc at a distance estimated as 50330pc by @xcite .",
    "@xcite therefore argue that those two pulsars are located somewhat in front of the gc .",
    "the same may apply to , with a larger lateral separation of about 130pc , but we also can not exclude a substantially larger distance .",
    "we consider it likely that @xmath70 .",
    "the spin parameters of the new pulsar are similar to those of in snr  , which has @xmath71ms , @xmath72 , @xmath73kyr , and @xmath74kpc @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of interest to compare the properties of both systems .",
    "the radius of the central pwn in  is @xmath75pc , nominally 50% larger than the pwn in .",
    "the radio luminosities may be similar , although this comparison is uncertain because of the much better frequency coverage for  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . in x - rays ( 210kev ) , @xmath76 @xcite . at the highest energies , both pwne are unresolved tev sources , and colocated with their lower - energy counterparts , but  is @xmath77 times more luminous than  in a comparable band @xcite .",
    "although the characteristic ages of both psrs  j17472809 and j18331034 are @xmath78kyr , the actual age of  and its snr is only @xmath79kyr @xcite .  could therefore be the older of the two , and one might be tempted to appeal to this possible difference to explain the larger size of the  pwn ( and of its shell , whose radius @xmath80 is also nominally 50% larger than that of ) and ( along with a smaller nebular magnetic field ) its possibly lower x - ray efficiency .",
    "however , the nominal difference in the two efficiencies is small compared to the scatter observed among young pulsars .",
    "dissimilar sn explosion kinetic energies and ejected masses could instead explain the different radii ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "some observables point to the possibility that also for , @xmath81 .",
    "the  shell is relatively bright in radio , unlike .",
    "this could be due to a different circumstellar environment , or may suggest that the snr has swept enough mass and is transitioning to the adiabatic phase .",
    "nevertheless , the pwn still retains approximate circular symmetry and central location within the snr shell , which likely indicates that a strong reverse shock has not yet formed . in that case , for the observed ratio @xmath82 ( similar to that of ) , the pwn evolutionary models of @xcite indicate a small age .",
    "the pwn energetics also indicate a small age : for , the pwn magnetic and particle energies add to @xmath83erg @xcite . this is smaller than @xmath84erg , suggesting that @xmath85 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "all these ideas are outlined more fully for /  by @xcite , including a discussion of the very significant differences with psr  j0205 + 6449 and its pwn 3c  58 , despite comparable spin parameters .",
    "all these considerations point in the case of /  to a system that , while not necessarily quite as young as / , may have an age of no more than about 23kyr . in turn , for spin evolution under constant magnetic moment with braking index in the observed range 23 @xcite , this would imply a birth period of @xmath86ms .",
    "the tev @xmath11-ray emission observed from both  and  is most likely due to inverse compton scattering of relativistic pulsar wind electrons .",
    "the seed photons for such scattering in general arise from dust , the cosmic microwave background , and star light .",
    "if is located close to the gc , the main contribution to the photon field in  likely originates in star light @xcite , and this could account for much of the greater tev luminosity of  compared to .",
    "if on the other hand  is located at a substantially greater distance , we would infer an even larger tev luminosity for  while the stellar photon field would have lower energy density .",
    "thus , careful modeling of the tev emission from the  pwn may help to constrain the distance to the system . in any case",
    ", it may be that much of the observed difference between  and  arises not so much from intrinsic differences in the particle spectrum injected , respectively , by psrs  j17472809 and j18331034 , as from their different environments .",
    "the pulsars themselves have comparable luminosities and are very faint . for , @xmath87mjykpc@xmath32 and @xmath88 @xcite . for , @xmath89mjykpc@xmath32 , and @xmath90 , assuming that  is the counterpart ( another potential candidate lies @xmath91 to its north ; * ? ? ?",

    "because of interstellar scattering ,  is not detectable at 1.4ghz without a much more sensitive observation than is possible in practice ( @xmath92ms , estimated by scaling from @xmath47 ) . until recently ,",
    "there were only four galactic young pulsars known with @xmath93ms ( the crab , j1913 + 1011 , b1951 + 32 in snr  ctb  80 , and j2229 + 6114 associated with 3eg  j2227 + 6122 ) .",
