    ", the measurements of the conductivity spectra of ballistic samples at zero magnetic field , and different biases between the layers , may constitute an alternative experimental method for detecting the lifshitz transition in graphene bilayer , supplementing the recent study focusing on the anomalies in the sequence of landau levels @xcite , at least in principle .",
    "we have investigated , by means of analytical mode - matching for the effective dirac equation , the length - dependent minimal conductivity @xmath0 of _ unbiased _ graphene bilayer with the nearest ( @xmath111 ) and the next - nearest neighbor ( @xmath10 ) interlayer hoppings included . the scaling function @xmath3 was found ( i ) to be insensitive to the precise value of @xmath10 and to the crystallographic orientation of the sample , provided that the physical dimensions are in the asymptotic range , i.e. , that @xmath112 ( with @xmath113 being the energy - independent fermi velocity in a  monolayer ) , and ( ii ) to have an attractive fixed point at @xmath85 .",
    "these features closely resemble quantum critical behavior predicted theoretically for disordered dirac systems with coulomb interaction @xcite , although the system we consider is ballistic and interactions are not taken into account .",
    "our results show that the well - known correspondence between charge - transfer characteristics of classical diffusive conductor and perfectly clean monolayer graphene @xcite is accompanied by another , probably more surprising , analogy between chaotic impurity scattering of interacting dirac fermions and ballistic transport via bilayer samples , which gets unveiled when one - parameter scaling is demonstrated .",
    "the actual effects of electron - electron interaction in bilayer graphene are generally beyond the scope of this paper . nevertheless , it is worth to point out that possible effects primarily include the gap opening due to spontaneous breaking of the symmetry between the layers @xcite .",
    "we show , analysing numerically the transport through _ biased _ bilayer , that opening a  few mev gap @xmath29 ( i.e. , larger than the lifshitz energy ) leads to the appearance of conductivity peaks at fermi energies @xmath114 , where @xmath110 , reproducing the dimensionless conductivity of a  ballistic monolayer .",
    "these are the reasons , for which an extensive experimental study of size - dependent conductance for clean bilayer samples with lengths @xmath115 m and widths @xmath116 , which is missing so far , seems crucial to determine the significance of the factors such as the trigonal warping and the electron - electron interaction in effective description of bilayer - based graphene nanodevices @xcite .",
