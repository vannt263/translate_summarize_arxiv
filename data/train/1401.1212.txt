    "at first glance , star formation appears to be a localised process . the coldest gas in the galactic interstellar medium ( ism ) clumps into turbulent aggregations known as the giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) .",
    "these stellar nurseries are on average , three orders of magnitude smaller than the galactic radii and the pockets within them that collapse to form stars are another order of magnitude smaller still . additionally , gmc properties have been observed to be remarkably similar across different galaxies , which might suggest a disregard for the structure of the galactic host @xcite .    yet",
    ", there is still more evidence that star formation is far from being unaware of its global environment .",
    "observations indicate an empirical relation that relates the galaxy s gas surface density ( @xmath2 ) and its star formation rate surface density ( @xmath3 ) by a simple power law @xcite :    @xmath4    where the measurements of the power index , @xmath5 , vary between 1 and 2 . generally referred to as the kennicutt - schmidt relation , this link between the gas distribution in a galaxy and its star formation holds on both local and global scales .",
    "moreover , recent work has shown that systematic variations exist in the relation and that the star formation activity may also be sensitive to global structural variations such as galaxy type @xcite , conditions in the galactic central region @xcite and the grand design @xcite .",
    "notably , this is distinct from material simply being gathered to produce a higher star formation rate , since then both the gas density and star formation rate density would rise in unison and not produce a variation in the kennicutt - schmidt relation .",
    "however , observations of the barred galaxy ngc 4303 by @xcite revealed a different star formation efficiency in the spiral arms and bar region of the disc , even in locations where the gas surface density is comparable .",
    "if star formation truly does care about its large - scale environment then this should be reflected in the properties of the gmcs , the nurseries whose conditions determine whether a star can form . within the milky way , the properties of gmcs have been measured to high precision @xcite , yet it is difficult from within our own disc to assess the impact of global structure .",
    "a more likely source of information comes from the growing catalogue of nearby galaxy gmc properties , many of which elude to environmentally driven differences between the populations in different galaxies @xcite . however , extragalactic data is limited by resolution , making it hard to assemble large enough samples of gmc properties to explore the dependence on internal galaxy structure ( a deficit that alma will tackle ) .",
    "the results we do have from such surveys strongly indicate that structure plays a key role in star formation . in the spiral arms of m51 , observations by @xcite find evidence for giant molecular associations ( gmas ) which later fragment into smaller gmcs in the interarm region .",
    "these gmas have a significantly higher surface density , while having the same estimated volume density , as a typical galactic gmc , suggesting they are a distinct group of objects and not simply an agglomeration of overlapping clouds . in the same galaxy , @xcite observed that sheering flows and shocks driven by spiral structures can stabilise gmcs that would otherwise collapse to form stars , changing the dependence between the star formation rate and gas surface density in such environments .",
    "it is clear , therefore , that understanding environment effects on gmc properties is key to understanding star formation itself .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "a dependence on gmc properties with galactic structure has been found by @xcite who saw a similar result to @xcite , with clouds leaving the spiral arms to be sheared and form interarm feathering .",
    "more compact interarm spurs were found by @xcite , due to kelvin - helmholtz instabilities forming down the side of the spiral arms .",
    "@xcite also found that the elongated gas structures in their spiral arms dictated the spacing of their gmcs , with fragmentation occurring at regularly spaced intervals . in the transient spiral",
    "galaxy models of @xcite , gas arms can gather material to form a gma , but then can themselves disperse the arm and their own structure .",
    "the two - dimensional simulations of m83 by @xcite found that gmcs forming in the bar region tended to be less bound than those in the spiral arms .",
    "their findings were consistent with observations that the velocity dispersion of molecular gas in the bar region both in m83 and in maffei 2 is high @xcite , raising the value of the virial parameter .",
    "one possible reason for @xcite s findings is the increased likelihood of collisions between gmcs in regions of high gas density .",
    "such interactions can either build the cloud via mergers , deepening its potential well and central density to boost star formation or by triggering a shock at the collisional interface to produce stars .",
    "the latter mechanism has been previously suggested as a way to unite the local star formation process with the globally observed kennicutt - schmidt relation @xcite and also as a way to create massive stars @xcite .",
    "therefore , the structure of the disc has both the potential to change the properties of the gmcs and increase their interactions to trigger star formation .    in this paper",
    ", we will focus on the effect of a grand design bar and spiral on the formation and evolution of the gmcs . in section   2 , we present our model of the barred galaxy , m83 and discuss the details of the three - dimensional hydrodynamical simulation .",
    "section   3 details our results , discussing first the global evolution of the disc and moving on to exploring the cloud properties and estimated star formation rates . in section",
    " 4 , we consider the effect of resolution and the way in which gmcs are identified .",
    "section   5 presents our conclusions .",
    "the simulations presented in this paper were run using _ enzo _ : a three - dimensional adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) hydrodynamics code @xcite .",
    "_ enzo _ has previously been used to model galactic discs where it successfully produced a self - consistent atomic multiphase ism , consisting of a wide range of densities and temperatures @xcite .",
    "we used a three - dimensional box of side 50kpc with a root grid of @xmath6 cells and 8 levels of refinement , giving a limiting resolution ( smallest cell size ) of about 1.5pc .",
    "cells were refined whenever the mass included in the cell exceeded @xmath7 , or whenever the jeans length covered less than four cells .",
    "this latter condition is suggested by @xcite as the minimum resolution required to avoid artificial fragmentation .",
    "the evolution of the gas in _ enzo _ was performed using a three - dimensional version of the _ zeus _ hydrodynamics algorithm @xcite .",
    "_ zeus _ uses an artificial viscosity as a shock - capturing technique with the variable associated with this , the quadratic artificial viscosity , set to the default value of 2.0 .",
    "the gas was self - gravitating and allowed to cool radiatively down to 300k .",
    "the radiative cooling used rates from the analytical expression of @xcite for solar metallicity down to @xmath8k , and continued to 300k with rates provided by @xcite .",
    "this allowed the gas to cool to temperatures at the upper end of the atomic cold neutral medium @xcite .",
    "actual gmcs have temperatures of about 10k , an order of magnitude below our minimum radiative cooling temperature .",
    "however , we lacked the resolution to sufficiently resolve the full turbulent structure of our smaller clouds , nor did we include pressure from magnetic fields .",
    "this temperature floor therefore imposed a minimum sound speed of @xmath9km / s to crudely allow for these effects .",
    "in fact , the velocity dispersion within our clouds was typically higher than this by about a factor of three , implying that the floor was not having a significant impact on our cloud properties .",
    "to prevent unresolved collapse at the finest resolution level , a pressure floor was implemented that injected energy to halt the collapse once the jeans length became smaller than four cells .",
    "gas in this regime followed a @xmath10 polytrope , @xmath11 . in order to study the evolution of the gas clouds alone",
    ", there was no star formation or stellar feedback in this simulation .",
    "our galaxy was modelled on the barred spiral galaxy , m83 , with the gas distribution and stellar potential taken from observational results ( see below ) . at 4.5mpc away , m83 is a nearby type sabc galaxy and has been observed at various wavelengths to measure its atomic @xcite and molecular gas @xcite as well as optical emission lines @xcite and x - ray @xcite .",
    "its gmc properties are also being observed by alma in cycle 0 and cycle 1 ( hirota et al . , in prep . ) .      for the galaxy s radial gas distribution , we assumed an initial exponential density profile with a radial scale length of 2265 pc , based on the observations of @xcite .",
    "the initial vertical distribution was assumed to be proportional to @xmath12 with a vertical scale height of @xmath13pc .",
    "the total gas mass in the simulation was taken again from the observations of @xcite , where the @xmath14 gas mass was recorded as @xmath15 .",
    "this gave an initial gas distribution :    @xmath16    the gas was set in circular motion as calculated via @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the enclosed mass of stars , dark matter and gas within the radius @xmath19 .",
    "we used @xmath20 fixed - motion star particles to create a stellar potential model in keeping with the observed global characteristics of the stellar distribution in m83 .",
    "this model was from the work of @xcite , who analysed the 2mass k - band image of m83 @xcite .",
    "the stellar density , consisting of the disc , bulge , bar and spiral arms was given by :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the radial distribution of each component and @xmath23 is the vertical distribution .",
    "each of these were given by :    @xmath24 & & \\sigma_{\\rm bulge}(r ) = \\dfrac{1000}{\\{1+(r/140{\\rm pc})^2\\}^{1.5}},\\\\ & & \\hspace{120pt } ( 0\\ { \\rm pc}\\lid r \\lid 9200\\ { \\rm pc})\\nonumber\\\\[12pt ] & & \\sigma_{\\rm bar}(r ) = \\dfrac{3}{100}(1150{\\rm pc}-r ) + 3.0,\\\\ & & \\hspace{120pt } ( 0\\ { \\rm pc}\\lid r \\lid 3220\\ { \\rm pc})\\nonumber\\\\[12pt ] & & \\sigma_{\\rm spiral}(r ) = -\\dfrac{0.7}{900}(r-3450{\\rm pc})^2 + 0.7\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace{50pt } - \\dfrac{0.6}{2500}(r - 3450\\ { \\rm pc})(r - 5750\\ { \\rm",

    "however , m83 has a starburst at the nucleus and so the actual total stellar mass of the nucleus has to be less than what was assumed . owing to this",
    ", we decreased the influence of the bulge potential by 35% by distributing the star particles between equations  [ eq : ic_disc ] - [ eq : ic_spiral ] in a 2:0.7:2:2 ratio .",
    "we assumed the vertical stellar distribution @xmath23 was :    @xmath25    figure  [ star particles ] shows the resulting distribution of the star particles .",
    "the top panel shows the axisymmetric star particles distribution where blue dots mark disc particles and black show the bulge .",
    "the bottom panel shows the non - axisymmetric star particle distribution ( where red dots are the bar particles and green dots denote spiral arms ) which is rotated at 54 km / s / kpc , the estimated pattern speed for m83 @xcite .    each star particle has a mass of @xmath26 , giving a total stellar mass of @xmath27 , in agreement with observational results ( see section  [ sec : numerics_masses ] ) .    to remove the discreteness effects of the star particles , we smoothed the particles gravitational contribution by adding the mass onto the grid at amr level 4 , with a cell size of 50pc .      in additional to the stellar potential , the galaxy sits in a static dark matter halo with an nfw profile @xcite .",
    "the halo concentration parameter was set to @xmath28 , while the virial mass ( within which the density is 200 times the cosmological critical value ) , @xmath29 , a value obtained by comparison with the observational results ( see section  [ sec : numerics_masses ] ) .",
    "the stellar and dark matter masses of @xmath30m@xmath31 and @xmath32 m@xmath31 , were selected via comparisons between our model s rotation curve and that from the observational results from m83 @xcite .",
    "we also compared and matched the size of the bar obtained from the m83 @xmath33(j=1 - 0 ) observations @xcite with the size of the bar structure formed in the simulation at 240myr . in both cases ,",
    "the position of the bar - end from the galactic centre was approximately 2.3kpc . within the radius of the galaxy disc , the stellar mass dominated over the dark matter to ensure a grand design spiral .",
    "the giant molecular clouds in our simulation were identified as coherent structures contained within contours at the threshold density of @xmath34@xmath35 , similar to the observed mean volume densities of typical galactic gmcs . note",
    "that since the formation of molecules was not being followed in our simulation , the gas is purely atomic .",
    "however , at the threshold density , it is reasonable to assume the cloud would consist of both a molecular core and atomic envelope .",
    "we refer to this method as the _ ` contour method ' _ for cloud identification .",
    "we also used an additional method for defining gmcs that builds clouds around density local maxima@xcite . here",
    ", peaks are found in the baryon density field that have @xmath36 .",
    "neighbouring cells are then recursively searched and assigned to the cloud if they also have densities @xmath37 . density peaks",
    "further 20pc apart are identified as separate clouds .",
    "we refer to this method as the _ ` peak method'_.    the main difference between these two methods is that in the second case , multiple clouds may exist within the same continuous density structure if it contains more than one well - separated peak .    in this paper",
    ", we mainly focus on the results of the _ contour method _ due to its ability to identify large bodies that ( visually ) appear to be a single entity .",
    "this allows us to assess more easily the difference the environment was having on the cloud properties .",
    "notably , however , the overall results from these two methods are very similar .",
    "we discuss this in a quantitative way in section  [ sec : cloud_comparison ] .    to follow the evolution of the clouds , simulation outputs were analysed every 1myr and the clouds were mapped between outputs with a tag number assigned to each cloud .",
    "the algorithm of this cloud tracking is described in @xcite .",
    "a merger is said to have happened when a single cloud is at the predicted position for two other clouds after 1myr of evolution .",
    "in the initial stages of the simulation , the gas profile is smoothly exponential as described in section  [ sec : numerics_disc ] . as the simulation begins and the gas feels the impact of the stellar potential , two shock waves are formed at the point of co - rotation between the stellar potential s pattern speed and the gas circular velocity .",
    "as they move in opposite directions through the disc , the gas falls into the grand design pattern .",
    "self - gravity then begins to act , fragmenting the gas into knots and filaments .",
    "after 120myr ( one pattern rotation period ) , the gas is fully fragmented , and between 200myr and 280myr , the galactic disc settles into a quasi - equilibrium with no large structural change .",
    "the surface density of the inner 15kpc of the galactic disc is shown in figure  [ fig : disc_images ] at three different times after the main fragmentation : t = 200 , 240 and 280myr . given the period of rotation for the non - antisymmetric stellar potential ( pattern speed ) is about 120myr , the figure shows approximately @xmath38rd of a pattern rotation .",
    "the gas circular velocity gives a orbital period of about 240myr ( our middle panel ) at the disc s outer edge , 8kpc .",
    "the grand design of the bar and spiral arms can be clearly seen in each panel of figure  [ fig : disc_images ] .",
    "these global galactic structures are consistent with the @xmath33(j=1 - 0 ) image of m83 @xcite , with the bar - end at @xmath39 .",
    "the bar and spiral arms rotate counter - clockwise in pace with the non - axisymmetric stellar potential .",
    "we can see the formation of clouds as dense knots in the surface density field .",
    "these clouds are seen not only in the bar and spiral arms but also in the inter - arm region and outer disc .",
    "this is in keeping with observations , where clouds are observed both within the grand design s main features and also the inter - arm regions @xcite .",
    "the properties of the clouds during this quasi - equilibrium stage are the focus of this paper .",
    "the azimuthally averaged radial profiles for the galaxy disc are shown in figure  [ galactic disc properties ] at four different simulation times , t = 0 , 200 , 240 and 280myr .",
    "between 200myr and 280myr ( our main analysis time period ) , the disc properties are settled and show little evolution in agreement with what is seen visually in figure  [ fig : disc_images ] .    the left - most panel of figure  [ galactic disc properties ] plots the gas surface density , averaged over a height of @xmath40 , containing the full extent of the disc s vertical height .",
    "small fluctuations are seen in the surface gas density as the gas fragments interact and are stirred by the stellar potential , but the profile shape remains unchanged . at the very centre of the disc , the surface density does increase with time due to infall both from resolution ( it is impossible to maintain perfect circular motion on a cartesian grid at very small radii ) and gas motion induced by the bar s potential . in m83 , this bar instability causes a starburst in the central region at radius @xmath41 @xcite . if we allowed star formation and stellar feedback in our model , we would expect the gas ejection from such a burst to suppress this concentration of central gas . since we do not include this process in our model",
    ", we ignore the galaxy s central region ( @xmath42 ) in our analysis of the cloud properties .",
    "the middle panel of figure  [ galactic disc properties ] shows the radial profile of the mean circular velocity of the gas .",
    "this is calculated as a mass - weighted average over @xmath43 . here",
    ", the effect of the rotating stellar potential is clearly visible , with the gas deviating from its initial orbit away from the point of co - rotation between the pattern and initial gas orbital speed at @xmath44 kpc .",
    "beyond this point , the stellar potential rotates faster than the initial gas circular speed , driving the gas to a faster orbit .",
    "the circular velocity here is approximately 200km / s , agreeing with the rotation curve of m83 @xcite . within 3.5kpc ,",
    "the gas motion is dominated by the bar which , inside the bar ends at @xmath45kpc , forces the gas to flow along elliptical orbits .",
    "this produces an average velocity lower than the initial conditions , since the motion is not truly circular any more .",
    "the final right - most panel of figure  [ galactic disc properties ] , shows the one - dimensional velocity dispersion as defined by @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the velocity of the gas and @xmath48 is its circular velocity at that point . it is also calculated as a mass - weighted average over @xmath43 . with the gas motion initially set to follow a circular orbit ,",
    "the dispersion at t = 0 is zero . as the gas falls into the stellar potential and fragments into self - gravitating clumps that interact , the dispersion increases .",
    "as seen in the middle panel , beyond the co - rotation point , gas is accelerated by the spiral arms . meanwhile , within the bar region , the velocity dispersion is at its highest as the gas is pulled from its circular orbit to follow elongated elliptical paths through the bar . within this dense region",
    ", further cloud interactions also increase the velocity dispersion , a point we will return to when we consider cloud properties .    in figure  [ vertical gas properties ] , we show the vertical gas distribution and motion in the galactic disc .",
    "the left - panel shows the surface density of four regions of the edge - on disc at 240myr ( two pattern rotation periods and one gas orbital period at 8kpc ) .",
    "the top most image shows the complete disc , while the three images below show close - up sections of the bar , spiral and outer disc regions .",
    "overlaid on the lower three images are the positions of the clouds as identified by the contour method in section  [ sec : numerics_cloud ] . despite the gas cooling from its initial equilibrium temperature at @xmath8k and the lack of stellar feedback to inject energy ,",
    "the gas scale height remains around its initial value of 100pc , but with marked differences between the regions .",
    "within the bar region , the scale height is 115pc , the spiral region has a scale height of 105pc and the outer disc has a lower value at 80pc .",
    "the reason for the regional variations in the scale height can be seen in the right - hand plot of figure  [ vertical gas properties ] .",
    "this plot shows the normalised vertical velocity distribution of clouds in each of the three bar , spiral and outer disc regions at 240myr . in the bar region ,",
    "the clouds have a broad velocity profile , with vertical velocities out to 50km / s .",
    "in the disc , meanwhile , cloud vertical velocities remain more uniformly around 10km / s .",
    "this difference is due to strong interactions between the clouds . in the bar region ,",
    "the gas density is high and its flow is highly elongated by the bar potential , decreasing the distance between the clouds .",
    "the shear flow at the bar ridge and bar ends also decreases the interaction time , adding to the boost in the velocity dispersion we saw in figure  [ galactic disc properties ] .",
    "a lesser but still notable effect is also seen in the spiral region , where the arms also gather material together to increase cloud interactions . in the outer disc",
    "however , the density of clouds is much lower as can be seen visually in the left - panel of figure  [ vertical gas properties ] .",
    "the number of interactions is therefore less , resulting in a lower scale height .",
    ".,width=313 ]    to compare the impact of different galactic environments on gmc properties , we assigned an environment group based on the cloud s physical location within the disc .",
    "the boundaries of our three regions , the bar , spiral and disc , are shown in figure  [ galactic disc with clouds ] .",
    "if a cloud is found within the radii @xmath49kpc , we recognise the cloud as a _ spiral cloud_. outside @xmath50kpc are the _ disc clouds _ , where we intentionally ignore clouds forming on the outer ring instability .",
    "this outer dense band of gas is from the toomre instability @xcite during the disc s initial fragmentation and therefore not as realistic an environment for cloud formation . _",
    "bar clouds _ form in a box - like region at the galactic centre , with a length of 5.0kpc and width 1.2kpc .",
    "the nucleus region inside 600pc is ignored due to it being very difficult to track clouds in this very high density area and the absence of a star burst degrading the comparison with observed gmc populations , as discussed in section  [ sec : results_global ] .",
    "we also do not distinguish the difference between spiral arm and interarm regions ; the number of clouds sitting between the spiral arms is small and hard to identify consistently as the spiral pattern rotates .",
    "the results of our identification scheme are shown using different coloured markers overlaying the gas surface density at 240myr in figure  [ galactic disc with clouds ] .",
    "blue circles show the position of the disc clouds , green diamonds denote spiral clouds and red triangles mark the bar clouds .",
    "black markers are for clouds identified via our contour method described in section  [ sec : numerics_cloud ] but which we do not include in our analysis for one of the reasons described above .",
    "the number of clouds is roughly constant during our main time period of analysis , from 200 - 280myrs and clouds rarely move environment during their lifetime . in the 240myr snap - shot shown in figure  [ galactic disc with clouds ] ,",
    "77 clouds are in the bar region , 515 are in the spiral region and 102 are in the disc .",
    "cc    cc    cc    cc    to see the impact of their environment on the cloud formation , we plot the cloud property distributions for clouds in each of our defined regions at 240myr in figure  [ distribution of cloud properties ] . in each plot",
    ", the red solid line denotes the distributions for clouds found in the bar region , the green dotted line is for clouds in the spiral region and the blue dashed line is the disc clouds . when describing our results below , we have compared most extensively with observational gmc catalogues from the milky way @xcite and m33 @xcite .",
    "these comparisons have limits , since as @xcite notes , gmc populations between galaxies have systematic differences and the surveys have been performed at different resolutions . at present",
    ", there is no survey of gmcs in m83 due to the low resolution of the molecular line observations ; a situation that should change with the results from alma cycle 0 and 1 . in the meantime ,",
    "the observations from m33 and the milky way provide a guide to assess our simulated cloud results .",
    "figure  [ distribution of cloud properties](a ) shows the mass distribution for these three environments , where the cloud mass is calculated the sum of the gas mass in each cell belonging to the cloud , as identified by the contour method described in section  [ sec : numerics_cloud ] . in all three cases ,",
    "the peak value for the cloud mass lies at around m@xmath51m@xmath31 .",
    "this is in reasonable agreement with the gmcs observed in m33 , where the peak mass was found to be @xmath52 and larger than observations of the milky way , where the peak weighs in at @xmath53m@xmath1 .",
    "the milky way , however , has an average surface density than is almost one - eighth that of m83 @xcite , likely aiding the production of smaller clouds .",
    "while the typical mass for the clouds does not appear to depend on galactic environment , there are two clear differences between the mass distributions in figure  [ distribution of cloud properties](a ) .",
    "firstly , there is a trend in the broadness of the mass distribution , with the bar clouds having the larger abundance of the most massive ( m@xmath54m@xmath1 ) and smallest ( m@xmath55m@xmath1 ) clouds .",
    "the disc cloud profile has the most limited range , with the maximum cloud mass found in the disc being just under @xmath56m@xmath1 , compared to the bar region s maximum at almost @xmath57m@xmath1 .",
    "this high mass end is in keeping with observations performed by @xcite , who investigated the compact fir bright sources on the _ herschel _ maps of m83 to estimate the mass of the giant molecular associations .",
    "these gmas had a gas mass in the range of @xmath58m@xmath1 , in agreement with our own clouds",
    ". it should be noted , however , that @xcite s resolution is limited to spatial scales around 200 - 300pc and our own simulation lacks star formation and feedback .",
    "both of these may have an influence in increasing maximum cloud size , with similar simulations demonstrating star formation can reduce cloud mass above @xmath59m@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the second notable feature is that the distribution of the bar clouds is bimodal , with two peaks at m@xmath51m@xmath31 and at m@xmath60m@xmath31 .",
    "the second of these peaks marks out the high mass clouds which appear as a distinct population , rather than a declining tail as seen in the spiral and disc regions .",
    "similar splits can be seen in the radii and surface density distributions and was an unexpected phenomenon whose origin we will return to below .",
    "all the trends observed in the mass distribution are repeated in the distribution for the cloud radii , shown in figure [ distribution of cloud properties](b ) , which defines the average radius of the cloud as    @xmath61    where @xmath62 is the projected area of the cloud in the x - y plane , @xmath63 is that in the y - z plane , and @xmath64 is that in the z - x plane .",
    "as with the mass , the peak value for the radius is the same for the bar , spiral and disc regions at @xmath65pc .",
    "this typical size agrees well with observations of the gmcs in both the milky way and m33 , which show characteristic radii of 9pc and 10pc , respectively . while the majority of clouds are found at this radius in all environments ,",
    "there is again a trend to find larger clouds in the spiral and bar , with the largest clouds in the galaxy forming in the bar region .",
    "disc clouds , meanwhile , remain below 50pc .",
    "we also see further evidence for a bimodal bar region population , with a clear deficit of clouds between 20 - 40pc in this environment .",
    "the spiral and disc populations appear to show a more gradual decline with the numbers of clouds at higher radii steadily decreasing .",
    "this situation changes when we look at the cloud surface density in figure  [ distribution of cloud properties](c ) . here",
    ", the cloud surface density is defined as    @xmath66    in this distribution , all three environments show a clear bimodal nature , with peaks at @xmath67m@xmath1/pc@xmath68 and @xmath69m@xmath31/pc@xmath68 .",
    "the first of these two peaks corresponds well with the typical surface density of the milky way clouds , which peaks around @xmath70m@xmath31/pc@xmath68 .",
    "the two populations in the bimodal distributions are most evenly distributed in the case of the bar clouds , with the peaks taking approximately equal magnitudes .",
    "the spiral and disc clouds show a smaller population for the lower surface density peak , which is least marked in the disc clouds .",
    "the three environment groups also follow the previous trend , with the bar clouds having the largest fraction of low surface density clouds ( @xmath71m@xmath1/pc@xmath68 ) and high surface density clouds ( @xmath72m@xmath1/pc@xmath68 ) , while the disc clouds retain the smallest range .",
    "perhaps the most surprising feature of the bimodality in the surface density is that it is seen in all three populations , while the mass and radius distributions only show a split for the bar clouds .",
    "moreover , the divide in the surface density appears to occur in the middle of the distribution , whereas the mass and radial plots suggest a smaller population of larger objects . to explore the origin of this phenomenon , we plotted the mass versus radius in the left - hand panel of figure  [ larson s law ] .",
    "known as one of larson ( empirical ) laws @xcite , the scaling relation between cloud mass and radius has been observed both for gmcs in the milky way and for cloud properties in other galaxies .",
    "the dashed and dot - dashed line on the left - hand panel of figure  [ larson s law ] show the observational fits , with the former being the m33 relation , @xmath73 and the latter , the milky way s scaling , @xmath74 .",
    "however , instead of seeing a single correlation between the cloud mass and its radii , figure  [ larson s law ] shows two parallel sequences lying either side of the observational results .",
    "these two sequences exist within each environment and correspond to the bimodality in the cloud surface density distribution in figure  [ distribution of cloud properties](c ) .",
    "the upper correlation contains clouds with a surface density higher than @xmath75 , while the lower line has clouds below that limit .",
    "if we focus purely on the bar clouds in figure  [ larson s law ] ( shown with red square markers ) , we can see there is another split in the upper , high surface density , sequence . in the plot region around m@xmath76m@xmath31 and @xmath77pc",
    ", there is a complete deficit of bar clouds .",
    "this then , corresponds to the bimodality of the mass and radii distributions in the bar cloud population in figure  [ distribution of cloud properties](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "clouds above these values are large and massive and typically not found in the disc region .",
    "the spiral region has clouds that extend into this area , but the number is low compared to the quantity of clouds of smaller size .",
    "the bar clouds , meanwhile , have a significant fraction of their number in this upper region , with the smaller clouds split between the two scaling sequences .",
    "thin black lines on figure  [ larson s law ] show the divisions for these three cloud groups which will be discussed as their own cloud types in the next section .",
    "if we return to figure  [ distribution of cloud properties](d ) , the distribution of the one - dimensional velocity dispersion of the clouds in the three environments is shown .",
    "the mass weighted , one - dimensional velocity dispersion is defined as    @xmath78    where @xmath79 is the velocity of the gas and @xmath80 is the cloud s centre of mass velocity . as with the previous distributions ,",
    "the peak dictating the typical cloud velocity dispersion is the same for all regions with a value of @xmath81km / s .",
    "this is comparable to the 6km / s characteristic velocity of the m33 and slightly larger than the milky way s 1km / s , which corresponds to the smaller cloud size .    at the high velocity dispersion end of the plot ,",
    "the bar clouds have the largest relative population , with the greatest fraction of clouds with @xmath82km / s .",
    "this is followed by the spiral and then disc populations , with the majority of the disc clouds having velocity dispersions less than 20km / s .",
    "the bar population is again bimodal , with peaks at @xmath83km / s and at @xmath84km / s .",
    "we can see this bimodality again by looking at the second larson scaling relation between velocity dispersion and radius ( @xmath85 ) , as shown in the right - hand panel of figure  [ larson s law ] . to better compare with the observational measurements , the velocity dispersion used includes the combined thermal component and",
    "is defined as :    @xmath86    where @xmath87 is the sound speed of cloud .",
    "this addition makes only a small difference , since the cold cloud gas has a typical sound speed of @xmath88km / s , 0.6% of the non - thermal 16km / s motions .",
    "the power - law fit for the observational data from m33 is shows as a dashed line , with an index of @xmath89 .",
    "the upper sequence in the bimodality lies on this observational relation but with a steeper inclination , giving @xmath90 .",
    "this value sits on the upper observed bound @xcite but is considerably higher than the typical measurements , which agree with the m33 result of @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "this steepening may be due to a sensitivity to the physics not included in this simulation .",
    "in particular , the lack of feedback may allow our larger clouds to become more bound ( and thereby have a higher velocity dispersion ) while our smaller clouds may struggle to resolve the internal motions .    as with the mass - radius scaling relation in the left panel , the linewidth - radius relation shows two sequences , although the lower sequence is significantly smaller than the upper trend .",
    "in the upper sequence of the bar clouds , there is a gap at @xmath92km / s and @xmath77pc , corresponding to the bimodal splits in figure  [ distribution of cloud properties](d ) and ( b ) , the same segregation that is seen for the bar clouds in the mass and radius relations .",
    "the final two plots in figure  [ distribution of cloud properties ] show the virial parameter and the orientation of the gmcs .",
    "the virial parameter in figure  [ distribution of cloud properties](e ) is defined at    @xmath93    and is a measure of the gravitational binding .",
    "a value of @xmath94 indicated that the cloud is gravitationally unbound while @xmath95 suggests a bound system @xcite .",
    "the clouds in all three environments show a peak @xmath96 value of @xmath97 , indicating that the majority of the clouds are virialised but only marginally bound .",
    "clouds in the milky way are observed to have a slightly lower @xmath96 value of @xmath98 .",
    "there is no obvious bimodal split in any of the cloud populations , but at values of @xmath94 , the bar region contains a significantly higher fraction of clouds .",
    "this is followed by clouds in the spiral and disc region , whose distributions drop off smoothly after @xmath99 .",
    "while the bar clouds also peak at this value , the majority of clouds sit to its right , indicating that most clouds in the bar region are unbound and take on a wide range of virial parameters .",
    "by contrast , the range in @xmath96 in the disc is much lower , with most of the populations sitting close to the peak value .",
    "this difference in the range of @xmath96 could indicate a more dynamic environment , where clouds have less time to settle to a virialised state .",
    "the final plot in figure  [ distribution of cloud properties ] , ( f ) , shows the distribution of the angle @xmath100 , between the cloud angular momentum vector and the galactic rotation axis .",
    "the cloud angular momentum is defined as the rotation with respect of the centre of mass of the cloud , with @xmath101 indicating a prograde rotation in the same sense as the galaxy and @xmath102 consisting of clouds with retrograde motion . in agreement with previous simulations @xcite ,",
    "clouds forming during the initial fragmentation of the disc ( @xmath103 ) are born prograde , inheriting the galactic disc s rotational direction , @xmath104 .",
    "after one pattern rotation period ( @xmath105 ) , when the disc has fully fragmented , the fraction of clouds at different spin orientations begins to increase .",
    "the disc clouds show the slowest evolution , with the population of high prograde and retrograde clouds increasing fastest in the bar , followed by clouds in the spiral region . by 240myr ,",
    "all three regions have clouds with the full range of orientations to the galactic rotation axis .",
    "the peak rotation angle actually sits at @xmath106 , suggesting most clouds rotate perpendicular to the disc .",
    "the fraction of retrograde rotating clouds is largest in the bar region , with the disc clouds remaining predominantly prograde .    in their isolated milky way model ,",
    "@xcite suggest that the cloud s initial prograde rotation can be lost during encounters with other clouds , e.g. cloud - cloud collisions or tidal interactions .",
    "the faster shift towards a more retrograde population is therefore indicative of a more dynamic environment with many cloud interactions .",
    "this ties in with the virial parameter distribution in figure  [ distribution of cloud properties](e ) , which shows clouds in the spiral and bar tend to be less bound , consistent with a high number of interactions .",
    "observations of m33 shows a range of cloud rotations , with 47% having a prograde rotation , 32% having a rotation perpendicular to the disc and 21% with retrograde rotation .",
    "if cloud interactions are a dominant form of higher @xmath100 values , then this suggests that cloud environment ( which will dictate such encounters ) is a key factor in determining gmc properties .    a last property that can be extracted from the data in this section concerns the stability of the disc .",
    "traditionally , the resistance of a rotating disc to fragmentation is measured by the toomre q parameter for gravitational stability @xcite .",
    "defined as @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the epicycle frequency , @xmath109 is the thermal sound speed in the disc and @xmath110 is the gas surface density , a value of @xmath111 indicates instability while higher @xmath112 values imply the disc will not fragment .",
    "since @xcite s original calculation involved a two - dimensional disc , the exact threshold for stability is debatable , with values between 1.5 - 0.7 being suggested via calculation and observation for a three - dimensional system @xcite .",
    "our disc begins with a steadily rising @xmath112 value between 2 and 4 from 1kpc to the outer edge .",
    "as the gas cools , this drops to between 0 and 2 over the majority of the disc surface , suggesting ( correctly ) that the disc will fragment .",
    "however , when the gas breaks into the objects we identify as the gmcs , the azimuthally averaged @xmath112 value increases as cold gas is bound up in the clouds while the larger volume of surrounding warmer gas is stable . this has also been seen in other simulations of galaxy discs such as @xcite . while the @xmath112 value implies the disc is now stable , this conclusion has to be incorrect since regions within the clouds must collapse to form stars .",
    "this discrepancy was noticed by @xcite , who pointed out that the toomre equation assumes a well defined surface density and velocity dispersion , whereas in fact the larson scaling relations show these properties are strongly dependent on the size of the region being measured due to turbulence .",
    "they argue that turbulence within the gmcs produces a transition between instabilities governed by large - scale gravitational fragmentation ( toomre ) and those controlled by small - scale turbulence .    to assess which of these forces has the upper hand",
    ", @xcite created a stability map based on the indices in the larson scaling relations , @xmath113 and @xmath114 : @xmath115 and @xmath116 . from our fits in figure  [ larson s law ] ,",
    "we find @xmath117 and @xmath90 , placing our clouds close to the border between toomre stability and small - scale instability .",
    "such a balance is expected if the clouds are virialised since the pressure balancing the self - gravity would follow the same scaling with size @xcite . however , our exact values place our clouds just above the line , suggesting that while close to viralisation , turbulence will initiate further instability .",
    "we therefore conclude that after the initial fragmentation , the disc is borderline stable to gravitational instabilities but unstable to turbulence .",

    "bracketed numbers show the actual number of clouds of that type divided by the total cloud number in the region . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the star formation efficiency ( @xmath119 ) from each of these three methods is compared in table  [ table_sfe ] with respect to the value in the disc .",
    "the sfe that is based simply on gas density ( standard model , section  [ sec : stars_standard ] ) increases by a factor of 1.5 in the spiral region and 2.6 in the disc . on the other hand ,",
    "the interaction based sfe ( cloud collision , section  [ sec : stars_collision ] ) shows an increase of 1.73 in the spiral and 4.34 in the disc .",
    "this simple calculation dramatically shows the main difference between the bar , spiral and disc environments : while the gas density is higher in the bar and spiral and plays a role in shaping the cloud properties , a more major difference is the frequency of the cloud interactions .",
    "notably , when turbulence is included as with the @xcite model ( section  [ sec : stars_turbulence ] ) , there is no difference in sfe between regions .",
    "however , it is unlikely we are resolving the full effect of the cloud interactions on the cloud s internal structure , which is likely to lead to higher compressible turbulent motion .",
    "since the star formation rate is too high compared to observations , the sfe is likewise above the observed values . @xcite finds a sfe for m83 between 0.2 - 2gyr@xmath120 for the bar and spiral region .",
    "the standard star formation model and turbulent model in sections  [ sec : stars_standard ] and [ sec : stars_turbulence ] have a sfe almost a factor of 10 too high ( in agreement with their star formation rates ) , with absolute values of 6.1 , 8.7 and 16.0gyr@xmath120 for the disc , spiral and bar regions respectively in the standard model and roughly 20gyr@xmath120 for the turbulent model .",
    "the cloud collision model agrees well with @xcite s observations in the spiral , with a sfe = 2.7gyr@xmath120 .",
    "however , it is markedly too high in the bar region at 4.34gyr@xmath120 , due to the reasons discussed above regarding the likely productivity of small cloud collisions .",
    "cc    cc    cc    ccc    the results presented in section  [ sec : results ] show the existence of three types of gmcs : the regular _ type a _ clouds , the _ type b _ giant molecular associations and the transient _ type c _ clouds .",
    "a key question therefore is whether these three different types can be observed in real galaxies .",
    "one of the controlling factors in both observational and simulation results is that of resolution .",
    "we therefore compared the cloud properties presented in section  [ sec : results ] with those found in two simulations performed at lower resolution .",
    "the comparison of the cloud property distributions at the three resolution limits is shown in figure  [ fig : resolution_properties ] .",
    "the distributions are plotted for all the clouds in the galaxy with the three lines indicating the limiting resolution ( smallest cell size in the volume ) of the simulation .",
    "the red solid line is our main simulation , with a limiting resolution of @xmath121pc .",
    "the green dashed line shows the results for a run with one less level of amr , giving a limiting resolution of @xmath122pc .",
    "the blue dashed line marks our lowest resolution simulation with @xmath123pc .",
    "the cloud mass ( figure  [ fig : resolution_properties](a ) ) and cloud velocity dispersion ( figure  [ fig : resolution_properties](d ) ) distributions show very little difference between the three resolutions .",
    "this is true even at low masses , where the clouds become more difficult to resolve .",
    "however , there is a difference at low cloud radii , where our main highest resolution simulation produces a greater proportion of clouds with @xmath124pc . at lower resolutions , the clouds blend to become extended structures with radii out past 60pc",
    "this has a very notable effect on the cloud surface density ( figure  [ fig : resolution_properties](c ) ) , where the second population of clouds with @xmath125m@xmath1/pc@xmath68 is entirely missing at the two lower resolutions , removing the bimodality .",
    "the larger radii also impacts the virial parameter ( figure  [ fig : resolution_properties](e ) ) , with cloud typical value moving from @xmath126 for the two lower resolution cases .",
    "the effect on the angular momentum angle , @xmath100 , in figure  [ fig : resolution_properties](f ) is small overall , showing similar proportions of prograde and retrograde clouds at all resolutions .",
    "the removal of the bimodality in the surface density profile at lower resolutions can be seen clearly in the mass - radius relation .",
    "figure  [ comparison of mass radius relation between different resolution ] shows the same plot at the three different resolution limits . only in our highest resolution case ( left ) is the upper and lower trend clearly visible . as we progress to lower resolution , the _ type a _ and _ type b _ clouds in the upper trend increase in radius , pushing their relation to the right on the plot .",
    "the result is a continuous sequence for all cloud types with a more uniform surface density around @xmath127m@xmath1/pc@xmath68 .",
    "this effect could mean that observations are unable to differentiate between _ type a _ and the transient _ type c _ clouds unless they are at very high resolution .",
    "the exact definition of a gmc is unclear both in theory and observation .",
    "generally , cloud identification schemes use a density threshold to arbitrate where the edge of a cloud should be , but even here there are multiple permeations .",
    "observers cloud find in surface density space or using position - position - velocity data while theorists prefer to use volume density , rather than selecting a viewing angle for their simulation .",
    "there is then the question of when an extended body should be considered multiple clouds , with the answer depending both on resolution and the researcher s choice .    to assess the impact of the choice of cloud definition on our results , we compared cloud properties found using the two identification schemes described in section  [ sec : numerics_cloud ] .",
    "the main difference between the two methods is how peaks within a continuous density structure are treated .",
    "our main _ contour method _ treats these as single cloud , while the _ peaks method _ divides the cloud if the peaks are more than 20pc apart ( the typical size for a gmc ) .",
    "this difference in methodology produces a large variation in the number of clouds . when using the _ contour method _ , we find 77 clouds in the bar region , 515 in the spiral and 102 in the disc at 240myr .",
    "the _ peak method _",
    "run on the same output locates 336 clouds in the bar , 1538 in the spiral and 229 in the disc .",
    "unsurprisingly , it is the bar and spiral regions that display the biggest differences in cloud number , with the tidal interactions around the giant _ type b _ clouds being subdivided by the _",
    "peak method _ into multiple bodies .    despite the difference in cloud number ,",
    "most features in the cloud properties closely coincide .",
    "the peak values for the quantities shown in figure  [ distribution of cloud properties ] are the same with an overall comparable range of values .",
    "the bimodality of the mass - radius scaling relation is also seen with the _ peak method _ , although the number of smaller clouds within a larger body increases the scatter .",
    "however , the distinct population of _ type b _",
    "gmas is not seen in the mass distribution when using the _ peak method_. figure  [ comparison of mass distribution between cloud definitions ] shows the mass distribution for the _ contour method _ ( top ) and _ peak method_. as mentioned above , the peak mass for the clouds is the same in both cases and the range in values is similar , but the bar clouds show no bimodality in the lower distribution . the fact these _ type b _ gmas exist in the data is visually seen in figure  [ figure of three clouds ] , but their irregular tidal tails produce a multitude of peaks that are broken up into separate smaller clouds by the _",
    "peak method_.    while neither technique is ` right ' or ` wrong ' ( since there is no established way to define a gmc ) , it is harder to discern the environmental differences when using the _ peak method _ , since it tends to produce a more uniformly sized cloud populations in regions of intense interaction .",
    "this is also felt to a smaller extent in the comparison of the mass range in the bar and spiral . for the _ peak method _ ,",
    "the distributions show only a small difference at the high mass end , but the _ contour method _ shows more clearly that the spiral region has a wider spread of cloud masses .",
    "this comparison suggests that the choice in cloud identification scheme may not be important in determining the broad cloud properties but may make a significant difference when exploring the finer details such as the difference between environmental regions .",
    "we performed three - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of a barred spiral galaxy down to a limiting resolution of 1.5pc and compared the properties of the gmcs forming in the bar , spiral and disc environments .",
    "our main results are as follows :    1 .",
    "the typical ( peak ) value of the cloud properties such as mass , radius and velocity dispersion , is independent of galactic environment .",
    "the values found agree well the gmc observation in the milky way and nearby galaxies , having a typical mass of @xmath128m@xmath1 and radius 11pc ( figure  [ distribution of cloud properties ] ) .",
    "this is despite having no active star formation or feedback in the simulation .",
    "the high - end tail in the mass , radius , surface density , velocity dispersion and virial parameter shows a clear relation to the galactic environment , with the pattern being bar @xmath129 spiral @xmath129 disc for the regions most likely to host clouds with extended structures .",
    "3 .   clouds in the bar region display a bimodality in the mass , radius and velocity dispersion distributions that is not visible in the spiral or disc regions .",
    "this is due to the formation of gmas , which build mass @xmath130m@xmath1 through multiple mergers with other clouds . since the bar is a densely packed region of clouds in close - passing elliptical orbits , the fraction of gmas is greatest in this environment , producing the bimodal distributions .",
    "all environments show a bimodal surface density distribution .",
    "this corresponds to two parallel trends on the mass - radius scaling relation .",
    "the lower trend is formed of transient , unbound clouds that are created in the tidal tails and filaments surrounding more massive clouds .",
    "( figures  [ distribution of cloud properties ] , [ larson s law of three type ] , [ figure of three clouds ] ) .",
    "5 .   based on the distribution results above",
    ", clouds can be classified into three types : _ type a _ are the most common cloud , forming the largest population in all three environments .",
    "their properties agree well with gmcs observed in other galaxies . _",
    "type b _ are massive gmas , formed via mergers with smaller clouds and most prominent in high interaction environments . _ type c",
    "_ clouds are unbound , transient objects formed in the dense filaments and tidal tails surrounding other clouds .",
    "they usually merge or dissipate within a few myr , although can live for longer if unperturbed .",
    "( figures  [ larson s law of three type ] , [ lifetime and merger rate ] ) 6 .   the main difference between galactic environments is not the properties of a typical cloud born in each region , but the ratio of the above three cloud types .",
    "the determining factor in this ratio is the level of interactions between the gmcs .",
    "_ type b _ and _ c _ clouds are formed during cloud collisions , with _ type b _ being the product of multiple mergers and _ type c _ forming most frequently in the dense filamentary structures that surround such encounters .",
    "the bar region has the highest rate of cloud mergers and also the largest number of _ type b _ and _ c _ clouds .",
    "the spiral region is the next most interactive while the disc is the most quiescent , leading to a cloud population that is predominantly _ type a_. ( table  [ table : cloud_percentage ] , figure  [ lifetime and merger rate ] ) .",
    "lower resolution simulations blur the distinction between the three cloud types , due to _ type a _ and _ type b _ clouds having larger radii at lower resolutions . linked with this",
    ", the cloud identification scheme can also affect separating cloud types .",
    "the cloud peak properties and range of values are preserved between two different cloud finding algorithms run on our simulation , but the scheme which splits density peaks in close proximity to one another fails to identify the _ type b _ gmas .",
    "this needs to be considered when comparing populations of clouds in observational and simulation data .",
    "although we successfully reproduce many of the properties of observed gmcs , the question of impact from stellar feedback is not addressed in our simulations . on our limited resolution",

    "<S> we investigate the impact of galactic environment on the properties of simulated giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) formed in a m83-type barred spiral galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> our simulation uses a rotating stellar potential to create the grand design features and resolves down to 1.5pc . from the comparison of clouds found in the bar , spiral and disc regions , we find that the typical gmc is environment independent , with a mass of @xmath0m@xmath1 and radius 11pc . </S>",
    "<S> however , the fraction of clouds in the property distribution tails varies between regions , with larger , more massive clouds with a higher velocity dispersion being found in greatest proportions in the bar , spiral and then disc . </S>",
    "<S> the bar clouds also show a bimodality that is not reflected in the spiral and disc clouds except in the surface density , where all three regions show two distinct peaks . </S>",
    "<S> we identify these features as being due to the relative proportion of three cloud types , classified via the mass - radius scaling relation , which we label _ a , b _ and _ c_. _ type a _ clouds have the typical values listed above and form the largest fraction in each region . _ </S>",
    "<S> type b _ clouds are massive giant molecular associations ( gmas ) while _ type c _ clouds are unbound , transient clouds that form in dense filaments and tidal tails . </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of each clouds type depends on the cloud - cloud interactions , which cause mergers to build up the gma _ type b_s and tidal features in which the _ type c _ clouds are formed . </S>",
    "<S> the number of cloud interactions is greatest in the bar , followed by the spiral , causing a higher fraction of both cloud types compared to the disc . </S>",
    "<S> while the cloud types also exist in lower resolution simulations , their identification becomes more challenging as they are not well separated populations on the mass - radius relation or distribution plots . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we compare the results for three star formation models to estimate the star formation rate and efficiency in each galactic region .    </S>",
