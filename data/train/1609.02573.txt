    "<S> the optical phase fronts remain orthogonal to the optical direction of propagation , and optical waveplates provide polarization adjustment so that the refractive index ellipsoid and 3-wave phase matching conditions , and the @xmath33 tensor orientation and emitted thz polarization , remain unchanged from the commonly employed linbo@xmath30 thz generation configuration .        </S>",
    "<S> the double - tilt approach has been demonstrated through an optical arrangement similar to that employed for the znte and pca measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the combined pulse - front tilt was maintained in the horizontal lab - frame horizontal plane , with the consequence that the transverse and longitudinal ( effective propagation ) directions , and the emission surface of the linbo@xmath30  are oriented out of the lab - frame horizontal or vertical planes . as for the znte and pca measurements , a temporal and spatial mapping of the fields near the surface was obtained with eo sampling . </S>",
    "<S> the transverse intensity profile of the optical beam is also shaped with cylindrical telescopes so that following oblique incidence on the grating and projection onto the out - of - plane oriented crystal surface , the thz source dimensions are approximately 15 mm in the propagating source longitudinal direction , and 2 mm in the orthogonal transverse ( cherenkov matched ) direction .    </S>",
    "<S> a temporal and spatial map of the thz field 500@xmath4 m from the linbo@xmath30  surface was measured with electro - optic sampling and is summarised in the data of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ lndata : fig]c - e . in this data </S>",
    "<S> set the single - cycle thz pulse is travelling at 0.98c , as determined through the time - delay of the peak longitudinal electric field as a function of longitudinal position across the emitting surface . </S>",
    "<S> the laser power incident on the linbo@xmath30  thz generating crystal was limited by the available laser system , and diffraction grating and optical losses , to 600@xmath4j . </S>",
    "<S> the transverse optical pulse shaping increased the optical pump energy density in the non - linear linbo@xmath30  while maintaining the desired propagation distance of approximately 10 mm . </S>",
    "<S> absolute electric field strength of a thz pulse can in principal be determined in eo sampling , through calibration of the eo signal into absolute polarization rotation of the optical probe together with knowledge of the phase - matching and @xmath34 non - linear response of the eo detection crystal ( see , for example , cliffe et al.@xcite ) . where the thz and optical probe do not propagate collinearly in the detection crystal , the experimental response function is further subject to angular separation of the optical probe and non - linear generated optical waves  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the physical separation of the optical waves in propagation from detection crystal to the photo - diode detectors will give rise to an underestimate of the thz electric field strengths . </S>",
    "<S> the field reduction arising from this physical separation of optical waves is extremely challenging to objectively determine , and here we have instead provided a lower - bound measurement of the electric field , based on an assumption of collinear thz and optical probe waves . with our modest laser powers </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a lower bound measured field strength of 0.20mv.m@xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> based on established capability of linbo@xmath30  we believe the true field strength to significantly higher , and that with improvements in laser system field strengths approaching 10mv.m@xmath35 may be readily obtained .    * discussion * + we have described and demonstrated a method for generating single cycle thz pulses that propagate with an effective sub - luminal velocity , and without distortion of the single - cycle field profile during propagation . the electric field polarization is constructed with a component in the longitudinal or propagation direction as required for acceleration of charged - particle beams . the transverse electric and magnetic fields that arise from the spatial and temporal gradients of the travelling source provide a focusing structure analogous to rf particle accelerators , but with a 1000-fold reduction in spatial scale . </S>",
    "<S> the 1ps duration of the thz pulse is 6-orders of magnitude smaller than the @xmath4s cavity fill - time of conventional rf accelerating structures . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath36 reduction in the time - integrated energy content of the electro - magnetic field while maintaining field overlap with particle beams offers the potential for dramatic reductions in the power requirement of high energy particle accelerators . </S>"
