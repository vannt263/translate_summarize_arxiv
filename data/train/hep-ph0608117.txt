    "at high energy , all the internal timescales of a hadron are time dilated .",
    "therefore , more and more soft fluctuations  carrying a smaller and smaller fraction @xmath0 of the hadron momentum  become long - lived and become relevant in interactions with another hadron . on the contrary , on the timescales relevant for such an interaction process",
    ", the large @xmath0 partons can be seen as completely frozen degrees of freedom , whose only role is to act as sources that radiate more small @xmath0 gluons .",
    "moreover , the small @xmath0 modes will eventually have an occupation number larger than unity , and undergo recombinations ",
    "a process known as _ saturation _",
    "@xcite .    in the color glass condensate ( cgc )",
    "framework @xcite , one thus divides the degrees of freedom of a hadron in static color sources",
    " described by a density denoted @xmath1  that represent the large @xmath0 partons , and dynamical gauge fields that represent the small @xmath0 partons .",
    "the cgc can thus be seen as an effective theory of gauge fields coupled to external sources .",
    "the details of this separation of degrees of freedom can change with the separation scale , but this should not affect physical quantities .",
    "this leads to a renormalization group equation  known as the jimwlk equation @xcite  that governs the evolution with @xmath0 of the distribution @xmath2 $ ] of hard color sources .    in these proceedings",
    ", we consider the collision at high energy of two hadrons ( or heavy ions ) described in the cgc framework .",
    "we assume that the distributions of hard color sources that describe the two projectiles are known , and we address the question of calculating physical observables in given configurations of the two sources .",
    "moreover , we will consider only the regime where the two projectiles are saturated , in which the two sources @xmath3 are strong  both of order @xmath4 .    as stated before",
    ", one must consider an effective theory described by the following lagrangian , @xmath5 with currents given at lowest order in the sources by @xmath6 these currents must be covariantly conserved ",
    "@xmath7=0 $ ]  which leads to a feedback of the gauge field on the currents . therefore , in general , the eqs .",
    "( [ eq : j ] ) get modified by corrections of higher order in @xmath3 .",
    "an important observation is that the strength of the sources lead to non - perturbative effects , in the sense that an infinite set of diagrams must be summed in order to calculate a quantity at a fixed order in @xmath8 .",
    "however , the large strength of the sources has also a valuable consequence : as we shall see later , the leading order is dominated by tree diagrams only , and it can be studied by classical methods .",
    "following @xcite , let us first consider the theory of a real scalar field coupled to strong sources .",
    "most of the _ structural _ properties we want to discuss can indeed already be studied in this simpler framework .",
    "some general results  that are to a large extent independent of the details of the theory under consideration  can be obtained by considering the generating function for the probabilities @xmath9 of producing a given number @xmath10 of particles  : @xmath11 in @xcite , we have proven that , if we denote @xmath12 the sum of all the cut _ connected _ vacuum - vacuum diagrams represents the natural order of these cut diagrams when the sources are strong . ] with exactly @xmath13 cut lines , the logarithm of @xmath14 reads @xmath15 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : f - def ] ) and ( [ eq : f1 ] ) , one gets the following expression has recently been proposed in @xcite . ] for the probability @xmath9  : @xmath16 in this formula , the index @xmath17 is the number of connected cut subdiagrams from which the @xmath10 particles are produced : @xmath18 particles are produced by the first of these @xmath17 subdiagrams , @xmath19 by the second one , etc ... if we further expand the prefactor @xmath20 , we obtain  : @xmath21 in this expression for @xmath9 , the index @xmath22 is the number of connected subdiagrams that are not cut ( this can be seen from the fact that it comes from the absorptive correction , whose sole role is to preserve unitarity ) .",
    "the term of fixed @xmath17 and @xmath22 in this formula can therefore be interpreted as the probability of producing @xmath10 particles from @xmath23 connected subdiagrams , @xmath17 of which are cut and @xmath22 of which are not cut . by summing this probability over @xmath10 , one `` integrates out '' some degrees of freedom in order to keep only the information about the probability of having @xmath17 cut subdiagrams and @xmath22 that are not cut , regardless of the number of produced particles .",
    "this probability reads  : @xmath24 summing this expression over @xmath22 from @xmath25 to @xmath26 , one finally obtains the probability of having @xmath17 cut subdiagrams  : @xmath27 one therefore sees that the number of cut subdiagrams has a poissonian distribution , with an average of @xmath28 .",
    "( [ eq : rpq ] ) and ( [ eq : rp ] ) are the essence of the abramovsky - gribov - kancheli cancellations @xcite .",
    "as one can see from the above derivation , they are simply a consequence of the factorization of a generic diagram in terms of its connected subdiagrams . therefore , we expect them to be much more general than the context of reggeons field theories in which they have first been discussed .",
    "another point should also be obvious at this point  : in order to obtain the eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rpq ] ) and ( [ eq : rp ] ) , one has `` integrated out '' the number @xmath10 of produced particles . by doing this ,",
    "the infinite sequence @xmath29 has reduced to the single combination @xmath30 .",
    "this means that a lot of the dynamical information about the theory under consideration has been lost in this process , and that there are certain questions that can not be answered anymore by the sole knowledge of the @xmath31 s .",
    "let us now consider the generating function @xmath14 per se , and discuss what it would take to calculate it .",
    "the following results on this question have been established in @xcite  :    * diagrammatically , @xmath14 is the sum of all the cut vacuum - vacuum diagrams , where each cut propagator is weighted by a factor @xmath32 . * at * leading order * , the derivative of @xmath33 , @xmath34 can be calculated from a pair of solutions @xmath35 of the _ classical equation of motion_. for a scalar field theory with a cubic coupling and a source @xmath36 , the classical eom reads @xmath37 the expression of @xmath34 is simpler if written in terms of the fourier modes @xmath38 and @xmath39 of these classical fields , @xmath40 and reads @xmath41 * the two solutions @xmath42 of the classical eom must obey the following boundary conditions  : @xmath43 * from unitarity , @xmath44 .",
    "this property serves as the initial condition for going from @xmath45 to @xmath14 , by writing  : @xmath46    unfortunately , finding the pair of solutions of the classical equation of motion that obey the boundary conditions of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : boundary3 ] ) is a difficult numerical problem , that has not yet been studied in this context .",
    "however , as we shall see in the next section , one can obtain from here a formula for the average multiplicity which is much easier to evaluate numerically .",
    "the moments of the distribution of multiplicities , in particular the average multiplicity @xmath47 , enjoy a special status because extra simplifications occur in their calculation .",
    "let us consider the multiplicity since it is the simplest one .",
    "one can get the multiplicity from the generating function as @xmath48 ( the second equality is of course simply due to @xmath49 . ) therefore , calculating @xmath50 is a special case  with @xmath51  of the calculation of @xmath34 . at @xmath51 , the third and fourth of the boundary conditions in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : boundary3 ] ) simply reduce to @xmath52 which means that the fields @xmath53 and @xmath54 are equal at large positive times , as well as their first time derivative .",
    "since the classical equation of motion is deterministic , this implies that these two classical fields are equal at all times .",
    "the first two boundary conditions in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : boundary3 ] ) then imply that @xmath42 are vanishing at large negative times , as well as their first time derivative .",
    "therefore , at leading order , the multiplicity @xmath50 is given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fourier - phi ] ) and ( [ eq : df1 ] ) with @xmath55 the _ retarded solution of the classical eom with a null initial condition at @xmath56_. one should emphasize the following : it was obvious from the beginning that the multiplicity at leading order would be somehow related to solutions of the classical equation of motion  since it involves only tree diagrams at this order  but it is a non - trivial result that this is with retarded boundary conditions .",
    "the retarded nature of the boundary condition is crucial in practice , in order to solve this problem numerically .",
    "going back to qcd , it is straightforward to generalize the previous results to the case of gluon production .",
    "the inclusive gluon spectrum is given at leading order by @xmath57 in this formula , @xmath58 is the _ retarded solution of the classical yang - mills equations _  in the presence of the sources @xmath3  and with @xmath59 and @xmath60 at @xmath56 .",
    "this problem was solved numerically in @xcite .",
    "the diagrams that are resummed by eq .",
    "( [ eq : gluon - lo ] ) are represented in figure [ fig : gluons - lo ] , as well as the resulting gluon spectrum .",
    "similarly , the production of quarks at leading order has been considered in @xcite .",
    "note that we use `` leading order '' somewhat abusively here , since quark production is strictly speaking a next - to - leading order effect  indeed , in the saturated regime , the number of produced gluons scales like @xmath4 while the number of produced quarks scales like @xmath61 .    for quark production at leading order",
    ", one must use the following formula , @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the retarded solution of the dirac equation  with the classical field obtained in the calculation of gluon production in the background  with a free negative energy spinor , @xmath64 , as the initial condition .",
    "the diagrams involved in eq .",
    "( [ eq : q - lo ] ) are sketched in the left of figure [ fig : quarks - lo ] .",
    "also represented in the right part of this figure is the resulting quark spectrum , for various quark masses .",
    "in fact , the production of quarks is one of the pieces  the simplest one  that contribute to particle production at nlo , i.e. at order @xmath61 . in @xcite , we have detailed the principles of a full nlo calculation of the particle yield , in the case of scalar fields .",
    "of course , things will be more complicated in qcd with gluons , but one crucial property of the result will survive  : _ the calculation of particle production at nlo can be done from retarded solutions of the classical eom and retarded solutions of the eom of a small fluctuation on top of the classical field_. the crucial point again is the fact that these objects are needed with retarded boundary conditions , which means that it is a problem which is tractable numerically in a straightforward way .",
    "two types of topologies , sketched in figure [ fig : gluons - nlo ] , contribute to the gluon multiplicity at nlo @xcite .",
    "one of them ( left diagram ) is very similar to that already encountered in quark production ",
    "it corresponds to the production of pairs of gluons , and involves retarded solutions for the equation of motion of small gluonic fluctuations on top of the classical field .",
    "the diagram on the right can be seen as a 1-loop virtual correction to the classical field ",
    "the field in the complex conjugate amplitude remaining the tree - level one .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the latter contribution can also be expressed in terms of retarded solutions of the small fluctuations equation .",
    "therefore , the result according to which the inclusive multiplicity can be calculated from retarded solutions of some equations of motion remain true at nlo . to this diagram with a virtual gluon loop",
    ", one must add two similar diagrams , respectively with a quark loop and a ghost loop ( only in gauges that have ghosts for the latter ) .",
    "one additional issue arises when one considers these one - loop corrections to the gluon yield : some of the contributions have a divergence of the form @xmath65 which is reminiscent of the divergences already resummed by the jimwlk evolution of the distribution of sources @xmath66 $ ] and @xmath67 $ ] for the two projectiles . for the cgc framework to be self - consistent",
    ", one must prove that these divergences that appear in the gluon yield for fixed @xmath68 and @xmath69 can be absorbed in the evolution of the @xmath70 $ ] @xcite .",
    "one can also consider exclusive processes in this framework .",
    "for instance , instead of the plain  fully inclusive",
    " probability @xmath9 of producing @xmath10 particles , one may define a probability @xmath71 of producing @xmath10 particles in a certain region @xmath72 of the phase - space _ and none outside of @xmath72 _ , and construct a generating function for these exclusive probabilities , @xmath73 one can show @xcite that this generating function can in principle be calculated at leading order by methods that are similar to those described in section [ sec : gen ] , modulo two differences .    * the boundary conditions for the two classical fields in terms of which on can express @xmath74 read  : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a function which is 1 in the region @xmath72 and zero outside . * _ the `` integration constant '' @xmath77 is no longer unity_. in fact , this quantity is the total probability of not producing particles outside of @xmath72 .",
    "it will appear as a prefactor in all the probabilities @xmath71 , and it can therefore be interpreted as a _ survival probability _ for the empty region outside @xmath72 .",
    "multiparticle production in field theories coupled to external time - dependent sources ",
    "e.g. in the color glass condensate framework for hadronic collisions at high energy  exhibits some non - trivial features when these sources are as strong as the inverse coupling : even in the weak coupling regime , one must resum at each order an infinite set of diagrams . quite generically , one recovers in this type of model the combinatoric relations among the probabilities of cut subdiagrams that lead to the agk cancellations .    at leading order",
    ", both the generating function of the probability distribution and the average multiplicity can be calculated from solutions of the classical equation of motion in the presence of the external sources . however , while these solutions must be found with complicated boundary conditions in the case of the generating function , the problem can be reduced to finding retarded solutions in the case of the multiplicity , leading to straightforward algorithms for calculating the multiplicity numerically .",
    "this has been done at leading order in the cgc framework for the production of gluons and quarks in nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "the present study can be extended in several directions .",
    "one of these extensions is the production of gluons at nlo ( nlo particle production has in fact been studied in @xcite , but the techniques developed there must be extended to gauge theories ) .",
    "another extension is the study of exclusive reactions , where one enforces some constraints on the phase - space of the produced particles .                  ,",
