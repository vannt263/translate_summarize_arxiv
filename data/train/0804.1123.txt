    "in recent years , with the advent of sensitive @xmath12-ray and x - ray detectors , high - energy radiation from stellar objects has been observed routinely .",
    "this includes in particular the long - soft @xmath12-ray bursts ( grbs ) , associated at present with a subset of hydrogen- and helium - deficient ( type ic ) sne ( woosley & bloom 2006 ) .",
    "their duration of @xmath13 2s suggests a compact progenitor with a @xmath81s light - crossing time , a wolf - rayet ( wr ) star .",
    "observations have revealed that there is in fact a continuum from @xmath12-ray to x - ray signatures in association with such sne .",
    "hence , some events are related to grbs in association with relativistic ejecta , while others are associated with x - ray flashes and the sn shock breaking out into the progenitor s dense wind , as in the type ic sn 2006aj and the type ib sn 2008d ( campana et al .",
    "2006 ; waxman et al . 2007 ; soderberg et al . 2008 . ; li 2007 , 2008 ) . in such sne ,",
    "the subsequent thermal emission from the cooling stellar envelope has also been observed ( e.g. , sn ic 1998bw : galama et al .",
    "1998 ; sn ib / c 1999ex : stritzinger et al .",
    "2002 ; sne 2006aj and sn 2008d ) .",
    "in contrast to type ib / c sne , hydrogen - rich ( type ii ) sne originate from main - sequence objects in the mass range 825 , with iron cores at the time of collapse buried under an envelope of @xmath8620 . the envelope light crossing time is @xmath80.65 @xmath14hr ( @xmath14 is the progenitor radius in 10@xmath15 ) and varies from about 5 minutes for a blue supergiant ( bsg ) progenitor to 1 hr in the largest rsgs ( levesque et al . 2005 ) . in type",
    "ii sne , these two properties prevent a central - engine from powering relativistic ejecta and from producing their associated non - thermal @xmath12-ray / x - ray radiation .",
    "hence , a burst of high - energy radiation from a type ii sn is most likely associated with shock emergence at the surface of the progenitor and its immediate aftermath .",
    "the shock - breakout phenomenon has been studied theoretically ( falk 1978 ; klein & chevalier 1978 ) , with specific attention to the bsg progenitor of sn 1987a ( ensman & burrows 1992 ; blinnikov et al .",
    "2000 ) or type ib / c sne ( blinnikov et al . 2002 ) .",
    "when the radiation - dominated sn shock wave travels outward through the envelope and reaches regions of moderate optical depth ( i.e. , @xmath16 of a few tens ) , a radiative precursor initiates the brightening of the object leading to a brief soft x - ray burst .",
    "this precursor starts when the radiative diffusion time ( @xmath17 ; @xmath18 is the atmospheric scale height ) becomes shorter than the shock - travel time to the surface , located at @xmath191 .",
    "the envelope structure and extent are two key ingredients controlling the properties of the radiative precursor . in the absence of a wind ,",
    "the expected durations are @xmath81s in a wr star ( blinnikov et al .",
    "2002 ) , @xmath8100s in a bsg ( ensman & burrows ) , and @xmath81000s in a rsg ( klein & chevalier 1978 ) .",
    "a very optically - thick wind , with a scale height comparable to the stellar radius , may , however , dramatically increase the diffusion time , and consequently the precursor duration .    in this letter ,",
    "we report the serendipitous detection with _ galex _ of _ rising _ uv emission in two type ii - p sne discovered by the supernova legacy survey ( snls ) , snls-04d2dc ( also reported by schawinski et al .",
    "2008 ) and snls-06d1jd , and associate both events with the breakout phase .",
    "this contrasts with previous early uv observations of type ii sne , i.e. , the type ii - pec sn 1987a ( hamuy et al .",
    "1988 ) , the type iib sn 1993j ( schmidt et al . 1993",

    "we finally post - process a sequence of 20 kepler models with the non - lte non - relativistic steady - state code cmfgen ( hillier & miller 1998 ; dessart & hillier 2005a ) .",
    "the solution for level populations and the radiation field at @xmath810@xmath54 frequencies is , thus , iterated to convergence on the stationary hydrodynamical structure , but allowing the temperature to relax in regions exterior to a rosseland - mean optical depth of @xmath820 .",
    "this ensures that our assumption of steady - state is consistent , i.e. , the diffusion time at the rsg surface being much less than the sn age .",
    "this is the first time the phase contemporaneous to shock breakout is modeled with a non - lte multi - angle multi - frequency radiative transfer code , which allows for both line and continuum sources of opacities and treats multiple species and ionization states , including hi , hei ",

    "thus , prevents our modeling of the radiative precursor .",
    "however , the small atmospheric scale height @xmath550.01@xmath51 in our rsg progenitor surface suggests that the precursor will last @xmath81000s , light - travel - time effects smearing the observed signal over @xmath8@xmath562000s .",
    "longer durations are possible , but would require a larger atmospheric scale height , perhaps reaching @xmath57 .",
    "this may be produced by an extended low - density envelope , as adopted by @xcite , although this appears incompatible with the rsg envelope structure computed with kepler , the 3d hydrodynamics simulations of rsg envelopes ( freytag et al . 2002 ) , and the quantitative spectroscopic analyses of rsg stars ( josselin & plez 2007 ) .",
    "alternatively , this may be produced by an rsg in a super - wind phase , i.e. , an rsg with an unusually high mass - loss rate @xmath5yr@xmath6 compared to the more standard values of a few @xmath5210@xmath58yr@xmath6 @xcite .    in figure [ fig_phot_prop]_a _ , we show in black the evolution of the temperature @xmath59 and radius @xmath60 , defined by @xmath61= 2/3 , where @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) is the absorptive ( scattering ) opacity .",
    "@xmath59 reaches up to @xmath81.35@xmath5210@xmath54k only @xmath80.5hr after breakout , associated with a brightening phase at constant radius ( light - travel time effects and the radiative precursor would yield a @xmath82000s signal instead ) .",
    "note that at this time , the `` rsg '' has the surface temperature of a white dwarf and radiates at 10@xmath9 times the rate of the sun ! the temperature ,",

    "kepler predicts a steep density distribution at the photosphere , scaling as 1/@xmath67 at breakout to 1/@xmath68 55hr later , a property also inferred from line profile morphology in sn 2006bp by d08 . with electron scattering dominating the opacity",

    "galex _ and snls light curves created from our synthetic spectra for snls-04d2dc and snls-06d1jd .",
    "the cmfgen models ( @xmath71 hr @xmath72 hr ) are offset by @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) mag for snls-04d2dc ( snls-06d1jd ) to match the sn 2006bp template light curves ( @xmath752 days ) that were scaled to fit the optical observations , suggesting that our models underestimate the observed luminosity by a factor of @xmath84 .",
    "we find no significant variability in the photon data between the first and second halves of the first two @xmath76 minute observations during the rise of the uv emission from snls-04d2dc and snls-06d1jd , with @xmath77m@xmath78 mag .",
    "although the lack of significant intra - observation variability and the @xmath8 2 mag amplitude of variability predicted by our models for the @xmath41hr long breakout signature implies that the _ galex _ observations do not coincide with the peak of the uv burst , the onset of the fast brightening uv emission is suggestive evidence that we have detected the breakout phase and constrains the time of shock breakout to an accuracy of 0.35 ( 0.75 ) days for snls-04d2dc ( snls-06d1jd ) , i.e. 7.1 hr ( 13.7 hr ) in the sn rest frame . within the errors , the subsequent 2day long uv plateau is well reproduced by the model , although we note the poor match to the noisy fuv data in the plateau of snls-04d2dc and to the fuv / nuv color of snls-06d1jd at @xmath81day .",
    "future , better sampled , higher s / n uv light curves of breakout events in type ii - p sne will provide more accurate constraints , foster a better understanding , and , thus , permit more definite conclusions on this ephemeral breakout phase and the rsg envelope structure .",
    "_ galex _ dis serendipitously detected fast rising uv emission in two snls type ii - p sne , which we associate with the breakout phase in a rsg star .",
    "the observed amplitude of the uv signal is smaller than that of the @xmath41hr long breakout burst predicted by our models , which suggests that the observations did not capture the peak of the burst ( we see no strong variability within the 20 minute observations ) , although our theoretical peak flux is likely overestimated by the one - temperature treatment in kepler .",
    "the important conclusion from these models is that the observed uv brightening by @xmath81mag is predicted to occur only during this early , breakout , phase and thus is a direct probe of the time of shock breakout in these sne .",
    "moreover , we both observe and predict that the immediate post - breakout in the uv is followed by a plateau phase of about 2 days , supporting a rsg - like progenitor ( more compact progenitors , e.g. , bsgs , cool much faster after breakout , as seen for sn 1987a ) , and providing an interesting clock to gauge the time since breakout . in sn 2006bp ,",
    "the sn was fading in the uv right from the start of data collection , and a time since explosion of 1.7days was indeed inferred ( d08 ) .",
    "the post - breakout uv plateau is the result of two competing effects , with the strong decrease in bolometric luminosity compensated by the shift of the sed to longer wavelength as the ejecta expand and cool ( fig .",
    "[ fig_phot_prop]_a _ ) . at maximum light ,",
    "the peak of the sed in our models is at 90    ( in the rest frame ) , and so the uv rise reveals only the evolution of the tail of the sed , not that of the peak .    the volumetric rate of type ii - p sne is close to that of type ia sne @xcite ; thus , we use the measured fraction of type ia sne in the total sample of snls sn candidates from sullivan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , @xmath79 , to estimate the fraction of type ii - p sne in our sample .",
    "if we assume that the shock breakout occurs @xmath80 days before the optical discovery of the sn , then the number of candidates in our study that had a probability of at least one _ galex _ observation during the 2 day uv plateau following shock breakout is @xmath81 .",
    "by contrast , the number of candidates that had a probability of having a _ galex _ observation that coincided with a 1hr long flash at the time of shock breakout is @xmath821 .",
    "we now estimate the number of type ii - p sne observed during the uv - plateau phase as @xmath83 , and get a detection efficiency of @xmath84 .",
