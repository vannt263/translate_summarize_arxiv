    "despite intense study over the past several decades , glassy and amorphous materials are still poorly understood .",
    "for example , a fundamental explanation for the stupendous rise in the viscosity of fragile glass - forming liquids as the temperature is lowered near the glass transition is still lacking @xcite . also , the response of glassy and amorphous systems to applied stress is difficult to predict because these systems display complex spatio - temporal dynamics , such as shear bands @xcite , strongly non - affine and cooperative motion @xcite , and dynamical heterogeneities @xcite .",
    "even basic questions concerning the nature of stress and structural relaxation have not been adequately addressed .",
    "important open questions include 1 ) what are the characteristic rearrangement events that lead to stress and structural relaxation , 2 ) how many particles are involved in such rearrangement events , and 3 ) are these events correlated and over what length and time scales ?",
    "an extremely useful concept for understanding the dynamical and mechanical properties of glassy systems has been the potential energy landscape ( pel ) formalism @xcite .",
    "the pel is the highly multi - dimensional potential energy function that depends on all of the configurational degrees of freedom of the system .",
    "it has been shown that the equation of state @xcite and dynamical quantities @xcite such as the diffusion constant and viscosity of supercooled liquids and glasses can be calculated in terms of geometrical features of the pel like local potential energy minima and low - order saddle points .",
    "related studies have also been performed on hard spheres to understand the glass transition in these model systems . a significant focus of this research",
    "has been to explain kinetic arrest in terms of decreasing free volume @xcite and configurational entropy @xcite near the glass transition .    in this article",
    "we investigate particle packings and features of the potential energy landscape in 2d bidisperse systems of frictionless disks .",
    "the disks interact via a finite - range continuous repulsive potential .",
    "we focus on mechanically stable _ ( ms ) _ packings with vanishing particle overlaps . in these mechanically stable packings",
    "any particle displacement results in an increase of the potential energy , i.e. , leads to overlap between particles .",
    "thus the set of ms packings in our system is equivalent to the set of collectively jammed states @xcite for hard disks .",
    "however , since we consider particles that interact via a continuous potential , we can explore not only geometrical features of configuration space in the neighborhood of a given collectively jammed state , but also properties of the energy landscape near a given mechanically stable packing .",
    "an important feature of the present work ( and our related earlier study @xcite ) is that we focus on small systems containing @xmath0 or fewer particles .",
    "related studies of small hard disk systems have been carried out previously @xcite , but these did not address questions concerning the frequency with which ms packings occur , which is the main focus of this work .",
    "we confine our studies to small systems for several reasons .",
    "first , we believe that understanding properties of small nearly jammed systems is crucial to developing a theoretical explanation for slow stress and structural relaxation in large glassy and amorphous systems .",
    "second , in small systems we are able to generate nearly all of the mechanically stable disk packings , which enables us to accurately measure the frequency with which different ms packings occur . also , detailed results obtained for small systems of different size can be extrapolated and used to infer properties of glassy materials in the large - system limit",
    ".    results from a number of recent studies emphasize that small subsystems are important for understanding the slow dynamics displayed in supercooled liquids and glasses .",
    "for example , experiments on colloidal glasses @xcite show that slow relaxation in glassy materials occurs through local cage breaking events .",
    "caging behavior has also been shown in a number of computer simulations of hard and soft particles , for example in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another indication that small subsystems play an important role in determining the dynamics of glass - forming liquids can be found in the results of recent numerical simulations of large binary hard - disk systems in ref .",
    "@xcite . using an appropriately defined signature of the kinetic glass transition ,",
    "these authors have shown that a slowly quenched system falls out of equilibrium at packing fractions @xmath2 in the range @xmath10 ( the larger packing fractions correspond to slower quench rates ) . as revealed by our recent study @xcite",
    "( see also the results presented herein ) , this is the packing - fraction range where the maximum of the density of ms packings occurs for small systems of @xmath11 particles .",
    "we believe that this is not a coincidence .",
    "the important role of small subsystems in dense hard - particle fluids stems from the fact that small systems become geometrically jammed ( i.e. , the system can not rearrange ) at packing fractions where significant free volume is still available for the motion of particles in their local cages .",
    "in contrast , for macroscopic systems even infinitesimal free volume per particle makes structural rearrangements geometrically possible .",
    "such observations suggest that one should seek macroscopic descriptions of glass - forming materials in terms of many coupled , nearly jammed small subdomains . at a packing fraction",
    "at which small subdomains become geometrically jammed , rearrangements can occur only if a domain is sufficiently uncompressed .",
    "large local density fluctuations , however , occur infrequently , because of the low compressibility of the surrounding domains at packing fractions above the dynamic glass transition .",
    "hence , the structural relaxation time is extremely large . a picture similar to the one put forward by adam and gibbs over @xmath12 years ago @xcite can also be constructed for systems of particles interacting via continuous potentials .",
    "in this case , relevant packing fractions can be defined using a temperature - dependent effective particle diameter .",
    "a small subsystem of a macroscopic system corresponds to a subspace in configuration space .",
    "thus , an approach that describes the dynamics of glass - forming liquids in terms of a set of small coupled subsystems should help to reconcile the local picture of glassy materials ( e.g. , trap models @xcite ) with the global pel view .",
    "however , before predictive theories can be constructed based on the ideas outlined above , one needs to obtain a more complete understanding of the behavior of small nearly jammed systems .",
    "an analysis of ms packings in small systems is relevant not only for understanding the slow dynamics of glass - forming liquids , but also for explaining the meaning of random - close packing in macroscopic athermal amorphous materials .",
    "we now turn to this aspect of the problem .    in ms packings composed of touching ( but not overlapping ) disks , the number of degrees of freedom is less than or equal to the number of constraints .",
    "thus , ms packings , or collectively jammed states , can be represented by single points in configuration space . in small systems we are able to generate nearly all mechanically stable disk packings .",
    "thus , we can investigate , separately , the number of distinct packings that exist in a given interval of packing fraction @xmath2 ( i.e. , the density of ms packings ) and the probability with which these packings occur for a given generation protocol @xcite .",
    "an analysis of the protocol - independent density of ms packings and protocol - dependent probabilities for each distinct packing allows us to address the question of why random close packing seems to be a well defined quantity ( i.e. , many distinct generation protocols give similar values for it , for example in refs .",
    "@xcite ) , but it is also a poorly defined concept because other protocols , for example , those that allow slow thermal quench rates , yield a continuous range of packing fractions at which jammed states occur @xcite .    in our opinion , questions concerning random close packing have not yet been fully resolved . in particular , although the maximally random jammed ( mrj ) state as described in ref .",
    "@xcite is a useful and important concept , we believe that it is not the final answer . for example , mrj involves an arbitrary choice of how to characterize order in the system and does not address the question of why a wide class of generation protocols yield similar values for random - close packing .    in our recent paper",
    "@xcite we argued that the random close packing density corresponds to the position of the peak in the density of ms packings @xmath13 , which becomes a @xmath14-function in the infinite system - size limit .",
    "as opposed to the protocol - dependent probability density @xmath15 for obtaining a packing at a given @xmath2 , the density of ms packings is a _ protocol - independent _ quantity .",
    "unless a given protocol is strongly biased toward states in the tail of the distribution @xmath13 , for example those protocols that involve significant thermalization , a well - defined random close packed density is obtained in the large system limit .",
    "this explains why many quite distinct protocols consistently yield similar values for the random close packed density @xmath16 .",
    "this explanation , while quite plausible , leaves a number of important issues unresolved .",
    "for example , we find that individual ms packings occur with extremely different frequencies even for a typical fast - quench protocol @xcite . two ms packings at approximately the same packing fraction @xmath2 but with drastically different frequencies are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : compare ] .",
    "there are no striking structural differences between these two ms packings , yet , the packing shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare](a ) is @xmath17 times less frequent than that in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare](b ) .",
    "moreover , we find that there are many more infrequent ms packings than frequent ones .",
    "an important issue is what determines whether a particular ms packing is frequent or rare .",
    "although it is clear that the particular protocol chosen to generate the ms packings plays a role in determining the frequency distribution @xcite , we argue that geometrical features of the pel also strongly influence the frequency distribution .",
    "first , our protocols , which involve a sequence of compression and decompression steps followed by energy minimization do not target any particular ms packings .",
    "yet , the probabilities of different ms packings vary by many orders of magnitude . moreover ,",
    "as we will show below , even when we significantly alter the protocol used to generate the ms packings , the most frequent packings remain frequent and the rare packings remain rare .",
    "the question of what gives rise to the extremely diverse probabilities of different ms packings is not only important for the analysis of random close packing , but also for developing statistical descriptions of granular materials and other athermal systems .",
    "for example , it has been assumed in edwards entropy descriptions of granular media @xcite that different jammed packings occur with approximately equal weights .",
    "similar assumptions are also usually employed in pel theories of glassy materials @xcite .",
    "however , these assumptions should be reexamined , since analogous geometric features are likely to control the frequency distributions of relevant states in these systems as in our studies of the frequency of ms packings .",
    "understanding the reason for the enormous probability differences and the comparative roles of the frequent and infrequent states are thus important unresolved problems .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ mechanically stable packings in bidisperse systems of disks ] , we describe the model and protocol we use to generate the ms packings and how we classify and count each distinct packing . in sec .",
    "[ packing frequency distribution ] , we review our results for the density of ms packings and their frequency distribution in small 2d bidisperse systems . in sec .",
    "[ energy_landscape ] , we investigate the correlation between local geometric features of configuration space near each ms packing and the ms packing frequencies by adding thermal fluctuations to the packings .",

    "[ hidden variable ] we introduce a simple phenomenological model to explain the dramatic variation in ms packing frequencies .",
    "we conclude and briefly discuss future research directions in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "we study the mechanical and statistical properties of ms packings in two - dimensional bidisperse systems of @xmath18 frictionless disks interacting via the finite - range , pairwise additive , purely repulsive spring potential of the form @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the characteristic energy scale , @xmath21 is the separation between particles @xmath22 and @xmath23 , @xmath24 is their average diameter , and @xmath25 is the heaviside step function .",
    "the particles are in a square unit cell with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the mass @xmath26 of all particles is assumed to be equal .",
    "we consider @xmath27-@xmath27 binary mixtures of large and small particles with diameter ratio @xmath28 .",
    "we study bidisperse mixtures because the presence of particles with different sizes inhibits crystallization ( provided that the size ratio is incommensurate with a binary crystal structure ) .",
    "in contrast , monodisperse disk packings crystallize readily @xcite , so these systems have entirely different properties than glass - forming liquids that are the subject of our investigations .",
    "bidisperse mixtures of disks with diameter ratio @xmath28 have been used in several previous studies @xcite .",
    "such mixtures thus constitute a convenient reference system for investigations of fundamental properties of amorphous and glassy materials .    in systems with finite - range purely repulsive interparticle potentials",
    "there are two general classes of potential energy minima .",
    "first , the system can possess a connected network of particle overlaps that spans the system ; the sum of forces on each particle in such networks is zero .",
    "these configurations have positive total potential energy , and each displacement of the particles in the network results in an energy increase . for the second type",
    "there are no particle overlaps , all forces are zero , the total potential energy vanishes , and the particles can be moved without creating an overlap .",
    "our focus here is on states that are on the border between these two general classes : we assume that the system is at an energy minimum with infinitesimal particle overlaps ( thus , the total energy is also infinitesimal ) .",
    "since these states are assumed to be in stable mechanical equilibrium and possess vanishingly small overlaps , we term these states ms packings .    if all particles of a ms packing participate in the system spanning force network , no particle displacement is possible without creating an overlap .",
    "occasionally , a small number of particles in a ms packing ( no more than three for the small systems considered herein ) do not participate in the force network .",
    "states with such free particles ( rattlers ) have to be treated with care in the packing generation procedures .",
    "however , we do not find that the properties of ms packings with rattlers deviate significantly from those of ms packings without rattlers .",
    "we use here a class of packing - generation protocols that involve successive compression or decompression steps followed by energy minimization @xcite .",
    "the system is decompressed ( or , equivalently , the particle diameters are decreased ) when the energy of the system at a local minimum is nonzero ; otherwise , the system is compressed .",
    "the increment by which the particle packing fraction is changed at each compression or decompression step is gradually decreased .",
    "after a sufficiently large number of steps , a ms packing with infinitesimal overlaps is thus obtained .    for each independent trial",
    ", we begin the process by choosing random initial positions for the particles at packing fraction @xmath29 ( which is well below the minimum packing fraction at which ms packings occur in 2d ) .",
    "we then allow the system to relax , and perform a sequence of compression / decompression and relaxation steps .",
    "we can repeat this process for many independent initial conditions , generate a large number of ms packings , and measure their respective probabilities for a given protocol .    in the present study , we use two energy - minimization methods : ( a ) conjugate - gradient ( cg ) minimization algorithm or ( b ) molecular dynamics ( md ) with dissipation proportional to local velocity differences .",
    "the conjugate - gradient method is a numerical scheme that begins at a given point in configuration space and moves the system to the nearest local potential energy minimum without traversing any energy barriers @xcite .",
    "in contrast , molecular dynamics with finite damping is not guaranteed to find the nearest local potential energy minimum since kinetic energy is removed from the system at a finite rate .",
    "the system can thus surmount a sufficiently low energy barrier . in the molecular dynamics method ,",
    "each particle @xmath22 obeys newton s equations of motion @xmath30 { \\hat{r}}_{ij},\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the acceleration of particle @xmath22 , @xmath32 is the relative velocity of particles @xmath22 and @xmath23 , @xmath33 is the unit vector connecting the centers of these particles , and @xmath34 is the damping coefficient . in the present study , we chose the dimensionless damping coefficient @xmath35 , but this will be varied in subsequent studies . in the infinite - dissipation limit @xmath36 the potential energy can not increase during a molecular - dynamics relaxation , and thus the molecular - dynamics and conjugate - gradient methods should give very similar results .",
    "we note , however , that even in this limit the two methods are not equivalent because there may be more than one energy minimum accessible from a given point in configuration space without traversing an energy barrier . in our previous studies",
    "@xcite , we used only the conjugate - gradient minimization algorithm .      in specific implementations of our ms - packing generation protocols",
    ", one needs to use appropriate numerical criteria for stopping the energy minimization process either in a configuration with overlapping particles forming a force network or in a state with no particle overlaps . for the the conjugate gradient method",
    ", we terminate the minimization process when either of the following two conditions on the potential energy per particle @xmath37 is satisfied : ( a ) two successive conjugate gradient steps @xmath38 and @xmath39 yield nearly the same energy value , @xmath40 ; or ( b ) the potential energy per particle at the current step is extremely small , @xmath41 ( where @xmath37 is normalized by the energy - scale parameter @xmath20 ) . since the potential energy oscillates in time in the molecular dynamics method , condition ( a )",
    "is replaced by the requirement that the relative potential - energy fluctuations satisfy the inequality @xmath42 .    following the energy minimization ,",
    "we determine whether the system should be compressed or expanded .",
    "if , @xmath43 , the system is below the jamming threshold , and thus it is compressed by @xmath1 . if , on the other hand , @xmath44 , the system is decompressed by @xmath1 .",
    "for the first compression or decompression step we use the packing - fraction increment @xmath45 . each time the procedure switches from expansion to contraction or vice versa ,",
    "@xmath1 is reduced by a factor of @xmath46 .    for the molecular - dynamics procedure to be efficient , rattler particles with no contacts",
    "must be treated with care .",
    "when the system is near the jamming threshold , we set the velocities of rattlers to zero ; we also shift the center - of - mass velocity of the remaining non - rattler particles to zero to assure momentum conservation .",
    "this modification of the energy - minimization procedure allows our stopping criteria to be implemented without change even when rattlers are present .",
    "otherwise , the kinetic energy of a rattler decays too slowly , and it is extremely difficult for the system to reach the threshold @xmath47 .",
    "the ms packing generation process terminates when @xmath48 after energy minimization . in the final state ,",
    "the system is thus in mechanical equilibrium with extremely small overlaps in the range @xmath49 .",
    "we verify the stability of each final equilibrium configuration by calculating the dynamical or hessian matrix ( i.e. , the matrix of second derivatives of the total potential energy with respect to the particle positions ) @xcite . in a small percentage of cases",
    "we find that the dynamical matrix has extra zero eigenvalues that do not correspond to rattlers , which indicates that the system is at a saddle point rather than at an energy minimum .",
    "such unstable packings are not considered . a more detailed discussion of the dynamical ( hessian ) matrix is given in sec .",
    "[ classify ] .",
    "our procedure for finding mechanically stable disk packings allows us to determine the jamming threshold in @xmath2 to within @xmath50 .",
    "the procedure is similar to those implemented recently for static granular packings with and without friction @xcite .",
    "our results , however , have much greater precision .",
    "high accuracy is important in our packing - enumeration studies , because some of the distinct ms packings have nearly the same packing fraction .    to illustrate typical behavior of the system during the ms - packing generation process in the version with molecular - dynamics energy minimization procedure we show , in fig .",
    "[ fig : v_t ] , the evolution of the potential energy per particle @xmath37 for several consecutive values of @xmath2 .",
    "note that the potential energy is not monotonic in time because of finite particle inertia .",
    "we consider two ms packings to be identical if they have the same network of contacts ( i.e. , their networks can be mapped onto each other by translation , rotation , or by permutation of particles of the same size ) .",
    "an analysis of the topology of the network of contacts is , however , a fairly complex task .",
    "thus , in practice it is convenient to use some alternative but equivalent criteria .",
    "a test based on the packing fraction alone is inadequate , because some packings with distinct topological networks have the same packing fraction ( within the numerical noise ) .",
    "we find , however , that a test based on a comparison of the spectra of the dynamical matrix is sufficient .    for a pairwise additive , rotationally invariant potential ( [ spring potential ] ) the dynamical matrix ( hessian )",
    "is given by the expressions @xcite @xmath51 and @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 . in the above relations the indices @xmath22 and",
    "@xmath23 refer to the particles , and @xmath55 represent the cartesian coordinates . for a system with @xmath56 rattlers and @xmath57 particles forming a connected network the indices @xmath22 and @xmath23 range from @xmath58 to @xmath59 , because the rattlers do not contribute to the potential energy .",
    "the dynamical matrix is symmetric , and it has @xmath60 rows and columns , where @xmath61 is the spatial dimension .",
    "thus it has @xmath60 real eigenvalues @xmath62 , @xmath63 of which are zero due to translational invariance of the system . in a mechanically stable disk packing ,",
    "no set of particle displacements is possible without creating an overlapping configuration ; therefore the dynamical matrix has exactly @xmath64 nonzero eigenvalues . in our simulations we use the criterion @xmath65 for nonzero eigenvalues , where @xmath66 is the noise threshold for our eigenvalue calculations .    in our numerical simulations",
    "we distinguish distinct mechanically stable disk packings by the lists of eigenvalues of their dynamical matrices .",
    "we assume that two ms packings are the same if and only if they have the same list of eigenvalues .",
    "( the eigenvalues are considered to be equal if they differ by less than the noise threshold @xmath67 . ) to verify our method we have also compared the topology of the network of particle contacts in different packings , and we have found that these two methods of identifying distinct mechanically stable packings agree .    as noted above , it is in general not true that each distinct ms packing possesses a unique packing fraction @xmath2 .",
    "however , we find that for small systems only at most a few percent of distinct ms packings share the same packing fraction . thus ,",
    "in the following we will associate a unique @xmath2 with each ms packing to simplify the discussion .",

    "the fluctuations in the packing fraction of large ms packings can be described by a superposition of local fluctuations in a large number of subsystems .",
    "therefore , the width of the peak in @xmath13 should scale approximately as @xmath99 by the central - limit theorem , which was confirmed in ref .",

    "close packing is a _ protocol - independent _ quantity .",

    "we have also discovered interesting regularities of the packing distributions , both as a function of @xmath2 and within narrow packing - fraction intervals .",

    "during the course of the molecular - dynamics run , we periodically save the particle coordinates .",
    "for each snapshot , the particle coordinates are fed into our ms packing - generation routine to find the nearest ms packing using the cg energy minimization scheme .",

    "we chose the time interval between instantaneous md snapshots to be @xmath128@xmath129 ( where @xmath130 is the integration time step ) , which is small enough so that it does not influence our results .",
    "for each initial ms packing and temperature @xmath119 , the procedure is repeated at least @xmath110 times with random initial velocities to obtain the average breaking time @xmath131 .",
    "a typical example of the breaking - time measurements at two different temperatures for a ms packing near the peak of the density of states @xmath13 is depicted in fig .  [ brakup time measurements ] .",

[ fig : eigens ] for the minimum , median , and maximum eigenvalues of the displacement matrix for @xmath97 at fixed @xmath168 .",
    "we also performed measurements at @xmath169 and obtained similar results .",
    "the power - laws extend over at least @xmath101 orders of magnitude in @xmath4 , although there is some scatter in the data for the largest eigenvalue @xmath170 .",
    "@xmath170 for several of the packings from the most frequent subset @xmath143 deviate from the main trend .",
    "the scaling exponents are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling_exponent ] and range from approximately @xmath7 for the largest eigenvalue to near @xmath8 for eigenvalues below the median .",
    "the fact that the largest several scaling exponents differ significantly from unity again indicates that ms packings are anharmonic , since in harmonic systems @xmath171 ( assuming that the eigenvalues of the dynamical matrix are independent of @xmath4 ) .    to illustrate the non - uniformity of the displacement - matrix spectrum , in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio_e ] we plot the ratio @xmath163 versus @xmath4 at fixed @xmath168 .",
    "we find that the ratio roughly obeys the power - law @xmath172 consistent with the results shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : eigens ] ( a ) and ( c ) and [ fig : scaling_exponent ] . fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio_e ] emphasizes that ms packings can possess extremely nonuniform displacement fluctuations with @xmath163 as large as @xmath173 for packings with small energy barriers . as in fig .",
    "[ fig : eigens ] ( c ) , there are several frequent ms packings with @xmath174 that have considerably larger ratios than this trend , but the vast majority of points obey ( [ rat ] ) .",
    "our data shows that ms packings possess highly nonuniform displacement eigenvalue spectra ( nearly all have @xmath175 ) and the non - uniformity substantially increases with decreasing @xmath4 .",
    "this suggests that the basins associated with ms packings are highly anisotropic in configuration space , and this gives rise to displacement fluctuations that are much larger in one or a few directions than others .",
    "thus , one simple picture is that ms packings break only along particular directions in configuration space and that the breaking direction will be correlated with the direction in which the displacement fluctuations are the largest .",
    "we will investigate this intuitive picture in future studies .",
    "the results presented in figs .  [ fig : eigens][fig : ratio_e ] allow us to determine if there is a direct link between the volume @xmath149 and the packing probabilities @xmath3 , where @xmath149 is the volume of configuration space near a given ms packing that contains points with potential energy @xmath150 .",
    "an estimate of this volume can be obtained by assuming that at temperature @xmath176 the system explores a large portion of @xmath149 .",
    "accordingly , we find @xmath177 where @xmath178 .",
    "the last expression in ( [ size of local region ] ) was obtained using the relation between @xmath156 and @xmath4 in ( [ gamma ] ) .",
    "thus , if we assume that the packing probabilities are controlled by the volume @xmath149 , we obtain @xmath179 where @xmath180 for the @xmath101-particle system considered here .",
    "however , our results in fig .  [ barrier hight cg and md ] show that the dependence of the packing probabilities on @xmath4 is much weaker than that predicted by ( [ final ] ) .",
    "the exponent for the @xmath101-particle data is approximately @xmath46 , not @xmath181 .",
    "thus , our results indicate that the packing probabilities are determined by a much lower dimensional quantity than the volume @xmath149 .",
    "our results are consistent with a scenario in which the packing frequencies are determined by only the largest several displacement eigenvalues .",
    "it is likely that the packing probabilities are correlated with the largest displacement eigenvalues because they may correspond to the ( initial ) escape directions from the basin of a ms packing .",
    "we also examined structural properties of ms packings in an attempt to identify features that control ms packing probabilities . specifically , we measured the probability distributions for the angles between lines connecting centers of particles in contact ( cf . , the definition in fig .",
    "[ fig : freq ] ) .",
    "we focused on the distribution of maximal angles between particle contacts because large angles ( close to @xmath182 ) correspond to unsupported ( and thus unstable ) chains of nearly collinear particles .",
    "as defined in fig .",
    "[ fig : freq ] , @xmath183 is the angle between the lines connecting the central particle @xmath22 to pairs of adjacent , contacting neighbors @xmath23 and @xmath85",
    ". a given particle will possess @xmath184 contact angles , where @xmath184 is the number of contacts for that particle .",
    "we calculated the maximum contact angle @xmath185 for each of the @xmath59 non - rattler particles and the maximum angle @xmath186 for each configuration .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : angle ] ( a ) , we present a scatter plot of @xmath187 for each ms packing in a system with @xmath97 particles versus the frequency @xmath3 with which the packing occurs for the md packing - generation protocol .",
    "this plot shows that there is no strong correlation between @xmath186 and @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , some highly probable ms packings possess large contact angles near @xmath182 .",
    "unsupported nearly linear chains of particles imply a low energy barrier .",
    "since the barrier heights are correlated with the probability @xmath3 for the md protocol , our results may thus suggest an important role of near contacts between particles .",
    "such contacts do not directly support the chain but they may prevent transitions to other ms packings when the system is fluctuating @xcite .",
    "we will return to this problem in future investigations .",
    "we also measured the distribution of the largest contact angles on each particle @xmath188 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : angle ] ( b ) , we compare the distributions of @xmath188 for the @xmath113 most frequent ( thin lines ) and @xmath113 most infrequent ( thick lines ) ms packings generated for a @xmath101-particle system using the md protocol .",
    "the figure shows two sets of curves .",
    "the probability distribution represented by the solid lines includes all @xmath188 in the system ; the dashed lines represent the distribution of only the largest half of the angles for each ms packing .",
    "in contrast to the results represented in fig .  [",
    "fig : angle ] ( a ) , the distributions depicted in fig .  [ fig : angle ] ( b ) do show a clear correlation between large angles @xmath188 and the frequencies @xmath3 of ms packings : the infrequent ones have an excess of large angles near @xmath189 compared to the frequent packings .",
    "thus infrequent ms packings tend to have multiple particles with large contact angles .    the structural differences between the frequent and infrequent states that we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : angle ] are quite subtle .",
    "we do not have any significant correlation with the single angle @xmath186 in the packing .",
    "the differences show up , however , collectively in the distribution of the contact angles for each particle in the packing .",
    "one of our long - term goals is to connect important geometrical features of configuration space to structural properties of ms packings that can be measured in experiments .",
    "in previous sections we presented a detailed study of the probability distribution of ms packings in small 2d systems of bidisperse frictionless disks .",
    "we showed that the probabilities of individual packings may differ by orders of magnitudes , not only as function of packing fraction , but also in individual narrow packing - fraction intervals .",
    "moreover , we identified important features of the packing probabilities @xmath3 that are only weakly affected by the details of the packing - generation protocol .",
    "since our packing - generation algorithms do not target any specific packings , there must exist important properties of the multidimensional configuration space that give rise to such widely varying packing probabilities .",
    "we have examined several local properties of the pel near the ms packing configurations and have found gross correlations between these properties and the packing probabilities .",
    "however , there is large statistical scatter in the data , and thus we conclude that none of the local features of pel that we have examined can fully explain the packing probability distribution .",
    "yet , in spite of the complexity of the problem we have found several interesting regularities . in particular we have determined that the probabilities @xmath3 in a narrow packing - fraction interval , evaluated for different values of @xmath18 , can be rescaled onto a single master curve with the characteristic shape shown in fig.[sorted probabilities for different n ] ( b ) . in this section",
    "we further explore this striking similarity of the sorted probability distributions .",
    "we base our analysis on a simple phenomenological model that has been inspired , in part , by the correlation between the packing probabilities and the minimal energy barriers [ cf .",
    "fig.[barrier hight cg and md ] ( b ) ] .    in this model",
    "we characterize each ms packing by a set of @xmath190 independent continuous random variables @xmath191 all with the same probability distribution @xmath192 , which is approximately uniform for @xmath193 and quickly decays beyond @xmath194 .",
    "the number of random variables @xmath195 is comparable to the number of degrees of freedom in the system @xmath196 .",
    "our central assumption is that the probability @xmath3 of a ms packing within the packing - fraction interval of interest is controlled by the _",
    "smallest _ of the random variables [ random variables ] : @xmath197    using this assumption , the probability density @xmath198 for the random variable @xmath199 can be written as @xmath200 where @xmath201 is the probability that @xmath202 .    from this result",
    "we can evaluate the expected value of the number of ms packings @xmath203 that have @xmath204 , @xmath205 where @xmath206 is a total number of ms packings .",
    "now we apply the above results to the packing fraction interval in which we have @xmath207 states . after inserting assumption [ main assumption of model ] into [ cumulative number of states in the model ] ,",
    "we obtain the expression @xmath208 where @xmath209 is the proportionality constant in eq .  [",
    "main assumption of model ] .",
    "accordingly , for a given probability distribution @xmath210 , our analysis yields the relation between the sorted probabilities @xmath3 and the index @xmath85 in the sorted sequence of states .",
    "this relation corresponds to the plot shown in fig .",
    "[ sorted probabilities for different n ] ( strictly speaking , to its inverse ) .",
    "our theory can not be directly verified without specifying the distribution of the random variables @xmath195 , and we do not have any _ a priori _ information regarding this distribution .",
    "our goal here , therefore , is more limited .",
    "we simply want to determine whether or not the numerical results shown in fig .  [ sorted probabilities for different n ] are consistent with our assumption that @xmath192 is a relatively uniform function in some range of @xmath211 , outside of which it quickly decays .    in making this assumption , we have in mind features of the pel such as the distance from a given ms packing to the passes in the rim of the local potential - energy basin . in each direction , the distance to the rim is smaller than the particle diameter ; it is also conceivable that the distance to the closest pass determines the probability @xmath3 .",
    "however , the specific meaning of the hypothetical random variables [ random variables ] in our phenomenological theory at this point has not been fleshed out .    to determine the approximate form of the probability distribution @xmath210 from our numerical results , relation [ number of states for given f ] is inverted , @xmath212 and the data sets represented in fig .",
    "[ sorted probabilities for different n ] are replotted in a form that emphasizes the structure of our model .",
    "specifically , in fig .",
    "[ speculation ] , the quantity on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "[ probability of x in terms of i ] is shown versus the normalized probability @xmath213 @xcite .",
    "the results in fig .  [ speculation ] indicate that the transformed quantity [ probability of x in terms of i ] is a nearly linear function of @xmath3 . by eqs .",
    "[ probability x not in interval ] and [ probability of x in terms of i ] , this linear behavior is consistent with @xmath214 where @xmath25 is the heaviside step function .",
    "the form of the probability distribution @xmath215 determined from our numerical results is thus compatible with assumptions of our model .",
    "the results in fig .  [ speculation ] can not be treated as a direct verification of our model , and the model itself is rather _",
    "ad hoc_. nevertheless , the simplicity of the result [ pi is theta ] is notable .",
    "we thus believe that our model captures at least some essential aspects of the problem .",
    "however , the exact source of the very broad distribution of the probabilities @xmath3 and the nature of the self - similarity of this distribution for different values of @xmath18 ( as revealed by the results shown in fig.[sorted probabilities for different n ] ) still remains an important open problem .",
    "we have performed extensive numerical simulations with the aim of generating mechanically stable ( ms ) packings of frictionless disks in small bidisperse systems .",
    "the ms packings are created using a protocol in which we successively grow and shrink soft , purely repulsive particles .",
    "each compression or decompression step is followed by potential energy minimization , until all particle overlaps are infinitesimal .",
    "we focus on small systems with at most @xmath0 particles in 2d because in these systems we are able to find nearly all distinct ms packings and can therefore accurately measure the frequency with which each packing occurs .",
    "one of the principal results in this work is that ms packing frequencies differ by many orders of magnitude both as a function of packing fraction and within narrow packing - fraction intervals .",
    "we have implemented here a fairly generic algorithm for generating ms packings , and this algorithm does not specifically target any of them . yet",
    "we find that packing frequencies are extremely varied ; moreover , the frequency variation increases with system size .",
    "we also find that the probability distribution can be scaled onto a single master curve .",
    "we argue that these striking results are important in a broader context of theories of jammed granular media and glassy materials . in thermodynamic theories for dense granular media",
    "@xcite it is usually assumed that ms packings within a small packing - fraction interval are equally probable . for our packing - generation protocol ,",
    "this assumption is certainly not valid .",
    "although we do not yet have sufficient data , we believe that ms packings will also not be equally probable for other commonly used experimental protocols , e.g. , slow shear @xcite or vibration under gravity @xcite . however , thermodynamic theories based on the equal - probability assumption are often applied to understand the properties of sheared or vibrated granular materials @xcite .",
    "our findings show that the often - used equal - probability assumption for stable grain packings in granular matter and inherent structures in glass - forming liquids should be re - examined .",
    "if it turns out that the assumption is generally violated , except for some unphysical , highly specialized algorithms ( and we expect that this is the case ) , thermodynamic theories of disordered granular packings will need to be significantly reformulated .    in this work we focused entirely on a system of frictionless particles .",
    "however , we would like to point out that for frictional particles there is another conceptual difficulty with the assumption of equal - probability packings . since static friction can arrest particle motion at different contact angles ( analogous to a block that can stop at any position on a wedge ) ms packings of frictional particles do not form points in configuration space , but rather continuous hyper - surfaces . since packings of frictional particles are often hyperstatic @xcite , the dimensionality of these hyper - surfaces changes from packing to packing , and it is thus difficult to introduce an appropriate probability measure .",
    "returning to the summary of the key results of our study , we note that important features of the ms packing probabilities do not change when we alter the packing - generation protocol .",
    "thus , we argue that _ protocol - independent _ properties of configuration space must play an important role in determining the ms packing frequencies . to investigate the connection between geometric properties of configuration space and ms packing probabilities , we added thermal energy to a set of ms packings and then measured several quantities as the system fluctuated .",
    "we monitored the time that elapsed before a ms packing broke to a distinct one , which allowed us to determine the heights of energy barriers that separate one ms packing from another .",
    "we also studied the displacement fluctuations in all possible directions away from the original ms packing to infer crucial features of the shape of the basin near each packing .",
    "we found a gross correlation between the frequencies @xmath3 of ms packings and the height of the lowest energy barrier @xmath4 separating this packing from other ones .",
    "the md packing frequencies roughly scale as @xmath216 with @xmath145 , but there is significant scatter in the data .",
    "in addition , we found that the eigenvalues of the displacement matrix scale as @xmath217 with @xmath218 .",
    "these results suggest that the ms packing frequencies are determined by one or a few degrees of freedom , not by the local volume of configuration space near each basin ( in which case @xmath3 would scale much more strongly with @xmath4 ) .",
    "however , the scatter in our data implies that there are important unknown variables that are linked to the ms packing probabilities .",
    "our results clearly indicate that this is complex problem and much more work needs to be done to fully understand what determines the ms packing frequencies . here",
    "we mention briefly some directions that we are actively pursuing to address this question .",
    "1 ) we are measuring the hypervolumes of the regions in configuration space whose vertexes are the nearby low - order saddle points of each ms packing .",
    "we will investigate the relation between these hypervolumes and packing probabilities .",
    "2 ) we are studying the ( @xmath219)-dimensional breaking vector that connects the initial ms packing to the ms packing to which it breaks .",
    "we want to determine whether or not the breaking vector is correlated with the directions of large displacements when the system is thermally fluctuating .",
    "financial support from nsf grant numbers cts-0348175 ( gg , jb ) , dmr-0448838 ( gg , cso ) , and cts-0456703 ( cso ) is gratefully acknowledged . we thank n. xu for providing us with some of the ms packings obtained using the cg energy minimization method and b. chakraborty and n. menon for helpful discussions .",
