    "magnetic fields likely play an important role in the star formation process ( e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the nature of this role is not yet clear , however , primarily due to the scarcity of observational data on magnetic fields in star forming regions .",
    "the zeeman effect remains the most direct method for measuring magnetic field strengths ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "observations of the zeeman effect in h i and oh thermal lines have revealed the strength of the magnetic field in the lower density envelopes of molecular clouds ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "observations of the zeeman effect in h@xmath5o  masers , on the other hand , offer a window into magnetic fields in the highest density regions ( @xmath6 ) of star forming regions ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "interstellar masers , being compact and intense , are extremely effective probes of young star forming regions .",
    "recently , @xcite carried out the first systematic study of the zeeman effect in the 6.7 ghz methanol maser line .",
    "such ( 6.7 ghz ) masers are examples of class ii methanol masers , which are known to be probes of the early phases of high mass star forming regions .",
    "yet another class of masers , namely class i methanol masers , may probe even earlier phases of star forming regions ( @xcite ) .",
    "this appears to be the case for m8e , which is a high mass star forming region located at @xmath7 , @xmath8 , at a distance of 1.5 kpc ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "m8e is comprised of a bright infrared source ( m8e - ir ) , and a radio  region about 8@xmath9 to its northwest ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "low spatial resolution co observations by @xcite showed that m8e is embedded in a dense molecular core . at higher resolution , @xcite mapped a bipolar outflow in the @xmath10co emission line ( @xmath11= 11 km @xmath12 ) , with blue and red wings spread over 50 km @xmath12 . based on their vlti observations ,",
    "@xcite concluded that m8e - ir contains a central protostar of mass 10 - 15 @xmath13 .    in this paper , we report the _ first _ detection of the zeeman effect in the 36 ghz class i ch@xmath0oh  maser line .",
    "the observations were carried out with 13 antennas of the expanded very large array ( evla ) toward the high mass star - forming region m8e , and represent an early success of the evla . in ",
    "[ sodr ] , we present details of the observations and reduction of the data .",
    "the analysis involved in extracting magnetic field information from the zeeman effect is given in ",
    "[ sanal ] .",
    "the results are presented and discussed in   [ sr ] .",
    "observations of the @xmath14 methanol maser emission line at 36 ghz were carried out using the expanded very large array ( evla ) of the nrao in two 2 hr sessions on 2009 july 9 and 25 .",
    "thirteen evla antennas equipped with the 27@xmath1540 ghz ( ka - band ) receivers were used in these observations . to avoid the aliasing that affects the lower 0.5 mhz of the bandwidth for evla data correlated with the vla correlator , the spectral line was centered in the second half of the 1.56 mhz wide band .",
    "the source 3c286 ( j1331@xmath163030 ) was used to set the absolute flux density scale , while the compact source j1733@xmath151304 was used as an amplitude calibrator .",
    "the editing , calibration , fourier transformation , deconvolution , and processing of the data were carried out using the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) of the nrao . after applying the amplitude gain corrections of j1733@xmath151304 on the target source m8e ,",
    "the spectral channel with the strongest maser emission signal was split , then self - calibrated in both phase and amplitude in a succession of iterative cycles . the final phase and",
    "amplitude solutions were then applied on the full spectral - line @xmath17 data set , and stokes @xmath18 and @xmath19 image cubes were made . in the channel with the maser line peak , we recovered about 70% of the flux density reported in the single dish observations of @xcite .",
    "further processing of the data , including magnetic field estimates , was done using the miriad software package .",
    "for cases in which the zeeman splitting @xmath20is much less than the line width @xmath21 , the magnetic field can be obtained from the stokes @xmath19 spectrum , which exhibits a _ scaled derivative _ of the stokes @xmath18 spectrum ( @xcite ) .",
    "here , consistent with aips conventions , @xmath18 = ( rcp@xmath16lcp)/2 , and @xmath19 = ( rcp@xmath15lcp)/2 ; rcp is right- and lcp is left - circular polarization incident on the antennas , where rcp has the standard radio definition of clockwise rotation of the electric vector when viewed along the direction of wave propagation .",
    "since the observed @xmath19 spectrum may also contain a scaled replica of the @xmath18 spectrum itself , the zeeman effect can be measured by fitting the stokes @xmath19 spectra in the least - squares sense to the equation @xmath22 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the fit parameter @xmath23 is usually the result of small calibration errors in rcp versus lcp , and is expected to be small . in these observations , @xmath23 was of the order of @xmath24 or less . while eq .",
    "( [ evlco ] )  is strictly true only for thermal lines , numerical solutions of the equations of radiative transfer ( e.g. , @xcite ) have shown that it gives reasonable values for the magnetic fields in masers also . in eq .",
    "( [ evlco ] ) , the fit parameter @xmath25cos@xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the zeeman splitting factor ( hz @xmath2 ) , @xmath28 is the magnetic field , and @xmath26 is the angle of the magnetic field to the line of sight ( @xcite ) .",
    "the value of the zeeman splitting factor @xmath27 for ch@xmath0oh  masers is very small , because ch@xmath0oh  is a non - paramagnetic molecule .",
    "following the treatment of @xcite for the zeeman splitting of 6.7 ghz methanol masers , we derive the zeeman splitting factor using the land@xmath29 @xmath30-factor based on laboratory measurements of 25 ghz methanol masers ( @xcite ) , and find @xmath27 = 1.7 hz @xmath2 .",
    "while this will likely introduce a systematic bias into the magnetic field results , it remains the best possible estimate pending laboratory measurements of the 36 ghz maser line .",
    "in order to demonstrate our detection of the zeeman effect in the 36 ghz class i ch@xmath0oh   maser line toward m8e , we display the stokes @xmath18 and @xmath19 profiles toward two positions in this source in fig .",
    "[ fivd ] ; the two positions are to the northwest and southeast of the maser line peak . as described in   [ sanal ] , we determined magnetic fields by fitting the stokes @xmath19 spectra in the least - squares sense using equation ( [ evlco ] ) .",
    "the values of the fit parameter @xmath31 ( see eq .",
    "[ evlco ] ) obtained from this fit are @xmath32 hz for the northwest position , and @xmath33 hz for the southeast position . using the zeeman splitting factor @xmath1 hz @xmath2  discussed in   [ sanal ]  above , this gives @xmath34  = @xmath3 mg for the northwest position , and @xmath4 mg for the southeast position . by convention",
    ", a negative value for @xmath34  indicates a field pointing toward the observer .",
    "the line - of - sight magnetic field has opposite signs at the two positions for which stokes @xmath18 and @xmath19 profiles are shown in fig .",
    "[ fivd ] , with values of @xmath1531.3 mg and 20.2 mg , respectively .",
    "the observed change in the sign of @xmath34  at these two positions , together with a slight asymmetry in the maser line profiles at each position , indicates that we are observing at least two masers that are very close in position and velocity .",
    "the masers are marginally resolved in our c - configuration observations , otherwise the opposite magnetic fields would sum to zero .",
    "evla b- or a - configuration observations will be necessary to fully resolve the maser components .",
    "such observations will not be possible until late 2010 or early 2011 .",
    "the observed change in sign of @xmath34  occurs over a size scale of 0@xmath9.9 , equal to 1300 au ( assuming the distance to m8e is 1.5 kpc ) .",
    "this may mean that the clumps where the 36 ghz maser is being excited come from two different regions where the field is truly different .",
    "alternatively , it may mean that the field lines curve across the region in which the masers are being excited , so that the line - of - sight field traced by one maser is pointed toward us , whereas that traced by the other maser is pointed away from us .",
    "since this is the first detection of the zeeman effect in the 36 ghz ch@xmath0oh  maser line , we will address the issue of beam squint , a topic which seems to arise every time a zeeman detection is mentioned .",
    "beam squint arises because the rcp and lcp beams have slightly different pointing centers .",
    "therefore , if a velocity gradient is present across an extended source , beam squint can give rise to a false zeeman pattern .",
    "since masers are compact sources , beam squint should not be an issue here .",
    "moreover , since the signs of the detected field are reversed at the two positions , it would be difficult to manufacture a velocity gradient that would reverse the signs of the fields as observed .",
    "our detected @xmath34  values in the 36 ghz class i ch@xmath0oh  maser line toward m8e are similar to the values obtained in the 6.7 ghz class ii ch@xmath0oh  maser line observed by @xcite toward other sources .",
    "@xcite detected significant magnetic fields in 6.7 ghz methanol masers with the 100 m effelsberg telescope in 17 sources , with an average value of 23 mg .",
    "since class i and class ii ch@xmath0oh  masers trace different spatial regions , this may indicate that the magnetic field is the same over the extent of these two regions , giving rise to the possibility that ch@xmath0oh  masers trace the large - scale magnetic field in the star forming region .",
    "alternatively , if class i masers occur in the very early stages of star formation ( before the formation of an ultracompact  region ) , and class ii masers occur later on , the similarity in @xmath34  for these two classes , if true , may indicate that the magnetic field strength remains the same during the early stages of the star formation process .",
    "certainly , more observations are necessary , especially in regions where both class i and class ii masers are known to occur , in order to address the possibilities noted above .",
    "finally , we use our observed value for the magnetic field to compare the magnetic and dynamical energies in these masing regions .",
    "the magnetic energy density is given by @xmath35 .",
    "here , we have used the relation @xmath36 that was obtained by @xcite on statistical grounds . for @xmath34  @xmath37 25",
    "mg from these observations , the magnetic energy density will be @xmath38 ergs @xmath39 .",
    "the kinetic energy density ( thermal and turbulent ) is given by @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the velocity dispersion , the mass @xmath42 ( assuming 10% he ; @xmath43 is the proton mass ) .",
    "since masers occur only in special directions along which they have developed the required velocity coherence , the velocity dispersions in the masing region may be greater than that traced by masers .",
    "if we use @xmath44 km @xmath12   a reasonable value ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , we get a kinetic energy density equal to @xmath45 ergs @xmath39  for @xmath46 @xmath39 , the density quoted in @xcite at which maser action in the 36 ghz line is maximized . moreover ,",
    "suppose we find fields of similar strength in the 44 ghz ch@xmath0oh  maser line in a future observation , 44 ghz being the other prominent class i ch@xmath0oh  maser line .",
    "then , considering the density @xmath47 @xmath39  at which maser action in the 44 ghz line is maximized ( @xcite ) , we will get a kinetic energy density equal to @xmath48 ergs @xmath39 .",
    "either way , the magnetic energy is dominant by at least two orders of magnitude , indicating that the magnetic fields must be dynamically significant in these regions .",
    "we have detected for the first time the zeeman effect in the 36 ghz class i ch@xmath0oh  maser line toward the high mass star forming region m8e .",
    "the detected values for the line - of - sight magnetic field are @xmath3 mg and @xmath4 mg",
    ". there may be systematic bias in these values due to the assumed zeeman splitting factor of @xmath1 hz @xmath2 , which is based on laboratory experiments on the 25 ghz ch@xmath0oh  maser line .",
    "our detected values are similar to the magnetic fields detected in 6.7 ghz class ii ch@xmath0oh  masers by @xcite .",
    "this suggests that ch@xmath0oh  masers may trace the large - scale magnetic field ; alternatively , the magnetic field may remain the same during the early evolution of the star forming region between the time when class i and class ii masers are excited .",
    "our detected values for @xmath34  imply that the magnetic field is dynamically significant to these regions .",
    "our detection gives rise to a host of questions that need further observational and theoretical work .",
    "we are planning future observations of the zeeman effect in more 36 ghz masers and at higher resolution .",
    "we are also planning for observations of 44 ghz masers with the aim of detecting the zeeman effect .",
    "as mentioned above , the 44 ghz line constitutes the other prominent class i ch@xmath0oh  maser line .",
    "we are also planning to carry out high angular resolution observations of the zeeman effect in regions containing both class i and class ii masers , in order to compare the strength of magnetic fields between the regions traced by these classes . from theorists ,",
    "we seek detailed models for class i masers in order to understand their properties better , especially the range of densities at which they are excited . also , there is a pressing need for laboratory studies of the zeeman splitting coefficient for ch@xmath0oh  masers .",
    "the resolution of some or all of these issues will open up yet another important window into the early stages of high mass star forming regions .",

    "we thank tom troland for some very productive discussions , and an anonymous referee for helpful suggestions .",
