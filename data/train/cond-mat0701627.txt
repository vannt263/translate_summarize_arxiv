    "in a previous publication@xcite the classical spherical spin glass was analyzed by using supersymmetry methods@xcite and it was pointed out that the model was `` anomalous '' because the order parameter @xmath0 that measures the replica s overlap was vanishing and the configurational average of any number of replicas gave the correct known result@xcite , then the annealed approximation with only one replica was also correct .",
    "more recent work on the calculation of the complexity , or logarithm of the density of states of a certain energy , of the p - spherical spin glass , @xmath1 , @xcite and of the sherrington - kirkpatrick model @xcite shows that the annealed average gives the correct answer when the action is invariant under the generalized becchi - rouet - stora - tyutin ( brst ) supersymmetry@xcite .",
    "+ in the present paper we first demonstrate how the generalized brst supersymmetry transformation applies to the functional integral formulation of the quantum spherical spin-glass.we also discuss how this internal invariance leads to ward identities that result in the vanishing of the replica overlap @xmath2.this result had been obtained previously for the classical spin - glass@xcite and justifies the performance of the annealed configurational average@xcite also in the quantum spherical spin - glass .",
    "the model was proposed earlier in ref.@xcite and was solved by using the distribution of eigenvalues of a gaussian random matrix .",
    "later , the interest in this model was renewed because it corresponds to the infinite-@xmath3 limit of the spin - glass of @xmath3-components quantum rotors and it was studied@xcite by using the replica method in a replica symmetric theory .",
    "both theories give the same phase diagram , although thermodynamic quantities as free energy and specific heat are not discussed . on the other hand , the spin - glass model of quantum rotors",
    "is equivalent to the ising spin - glass model in a transverse field@xcite .",
    "a formulation for quantum spherical spins with a different temporal dependence was presented for multispin interactions@xcite.critical properties were analyzed in ref.@xcite and applications to physical systems were presented in ref.@xcite .",
    "all these papers coincide in that the quantum spherical model presents a finite entropy and vanishing specific heat at low temperature , while the classical model presents a negative infinite entropy and constant specific heat . + we study the quantum spherical spin - glass in the annealed average by using a functional integral formulation derived by using feynman s prescription@xcite .",
    "in sect.2 we present the general formalism and discuss the supersymmetry transformation that leaves invariant the action together with the corresponding ward identities@xcite , while in sect.3 we discuss the results.we are careful to normalize the free energy so as to recover a finite classical limit when the rotors moment of inertia @xmath4 . in this way the phase diagram , that is calculated from the spherical condition , coincide with previous studies@xcite.in the classical limit @xmath5 the entropy diverges at @xmath6 in the typical fashion of the classical spherical model@xcite , with the important difference that it remains finite in the quantum regime for finite values of the rotors moment of inertia .",
    "the specific heat shows the usual discontinuity at the critical temperature but it vanishes at @xmath6 in the quantum regime .",
    "we derive scaling laws for the dynamical susceptibility , in agreement with previous results@xcite .",

    "the transformation differs infinitesimally from unity and @xmath47 can be neglected , although this concept is somehow meaningless in the case of grassmann variables .",
    "now it is convenient to switch to the superalgebra notation@xcite of the appendix and to introduce the supervectors for the auxiliary fields @xmath48 and for the field variables @xmath49 in this way the functional @xmath50 in equation([11 ] ) may be written in compact form @xmath51 \\label{15}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that may be formally integrated to give @xmath52 \\label{16}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the 4x4 supermatrices @xmath53 by symmetry we should have @xmath54 to derive ward identities@xcite we consider that , as the system is invariant when the fields are subject to the supersymmetry transformation in equation([12 ] ) @xmath55 where @xmath56 then it should be also invariant when we transform the external fields @xcite in equation([16 ] ) @xmath57 where the super - adjoint @xmath58 is defined in the appendix .",
