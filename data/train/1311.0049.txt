    "spin - orbit and exchange are the two dominant spin dependent interactions in solids .",
    "whereas the exchange splitting is only present in magnetic materials , spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) is ubiquitous .",
    "the proposal of various physical effects driven by spin - orbit interactions , such as the spin hall effect , both extrinsic@xcite and intrinsic,@xcite as well as the quantum spin hall phase,@xcite together with their experimental confirmation,@xcite is opening new venues , enlarging the set of materials that could give rise to practical spintronic devices .",
    "the effects of spin - orbit interaction are particularly notorious in materials without inversion symmetry,@xcite because they present spin splitting of the bands and the anomalous velocity is non - zero .    from this perspective",
    ", the new generation@xcite of semiconducting two dimensional ( 2d ) crystals , such as transition metal dichalgonides ( tmd ) monolayers ( ml ) , is particularly appealing .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction of the constituent atoms is large and those 2d crystals have no inversion symmetry .",
    "the resulting spin splitting of the bands gives rise to the so called spin - valley coupling,@xcite which has been experimentally confirmed.@xcite this effect is conspicuously apparent in the valence band ( vb ) of these materials showing the soc splittings ranging between 150 mev ( mos@xmath0 ) up to to 400 mev ( wse@xmath0 ) .",
    "the effect of soc in the conduction band ( cb ) , in contrast , have been overlooked except for a few instances.@xcite however , given that very often 2d tmd can be @xmath4-doped and the conduction band spin splitting is definitely non - zero , it is of the largest interest to study this effect .",
    "the origin of the large spin - orbit splitting of the vb is well understood : at the @xmath5 points , the valence band bloch states wave are mostly made of the metal @xmath1 orbitals with @xmath6 , where @xmath7 labels the valley index.@xcite therefore , the @xmath8 component of soc naturally gives a valley dependent splitting of the bands .",
    "in contrast , the dominant contribution of the cb lowest energy state comes from the @xmath9=0 orbitals , that cancels the spin orbit splitting , calculated at first in perturbation theory .",
    "thus , the conduction band spin splitting was neglected in the influential seminal work of xiao _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , proposing a * * k**@xmath10*p * model , and most of the papers that followed .",
    "only very recently attention is being payed to the conduction band splitting,@xcite using an extension of the * * k**@xmath10*p * original model,@xcite showing that inter - band coupling to remote bands , results in a finite cb splitting .",
    "however , the use of bloch states inherent in this method obscures the atomic origin of the spin splitting , which remains to be determined and is the main focus of the present work .    in order to address the relative contributions to the cb splitting of the two chemical species in the unit cell it would be convenient to describe the electronic structure of mos@xmath0 and related 2d crystals in terms of localized atomic orbitals .",
    "however , most of the existing density functional theory ( dft)@xcite calculations of the spin - orbit properties of these materials use plane waves as a basis set.@xcite in order to bridge the gap between plane wave and atomistic descriptions we make use of the tight - binding ( tb ) hamiltonian with a minimal basis set formed by the maximally localized wannier functions ( mlwfs ) .",
    "@xcite this approach keeps a precision of the plane wave calculations,@xcite and at the same time allows a description of the spin - orbit coupling using the intra - atomic terms @xmath11 . similar approach ( we call it tb+soc )",
    "was used to study the bi@xmath0te@xmath12 , bi@xmath0se@xmath12 , sb@xmath0te@xmath12 topological insulators,@xcite and its important advantage is that the atomic soc of the transition metal ( tm ) and chalcogenide ( ch ) atoms , can be varied as the @xmath13 and @xmath14 parameters , which permits to trace the origin of the spin splitting of the different bands .",
    "the study of spin orbit coupling physics in other two dimensional crystals , such as graphene , using the atomic @xmath11 hamiltonian has revealed very fruitful in the past.@xcite    the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ dft_calculations ]",
    "we present the dft methodology and the electronic structure of the four two dimensional crystals studied here , mos@xmath0 , ws@xmath0 , mose@xmath0 and wse@xmath0 . in section [ mlwf_basis ]",
    "we describe the way of obtaining the mlwf basis and the resulting tb hamiltonian . in section [ atomicsoc ]",
    "we include soc to the tb hamiltonian as a sum of atomic terms which depend on the @xmath13 and @xmath14 parameters , and we determine values of these parameters . in section [ cb_soc ]",
    "we take advantage of the model of section [ atomicsoc ] to discuss the relative contribution to the spin - orbit splitting of the conduction band of the two chemical species of the unit cell . in section [ conclusions ]",
    "we discuss the limitations of the model and we present our main conclusions .",
    "we now review the electronic properties of the mos@xmath0 , mose@xmath0 , ws@xmath0 , and wse@xmath0 mls calculated with dft in the plane wave basis as implemented in the vasp package.@xcite we take an energy cutoff @xmath15=400 ev .",

    "[ bands ] we show a comparison of the dft+soc bands ( left panel ) and with the just described tb+soc method ( right panel ) .",
    "it is notorious that , fixing the splitting of two bands at the @xmath5 point , yields a fairly good agreement for all the bands on the entire brillouin zone , giving additional support to the methodology .",
    "a more quantitative comparison between the tb+soc and the dft+soc calculations is shown in table [ tab1 ] where we compare the spin splitting of several bands at the @xmath5 point obtained with the two methods .",
    "of course , by construction of the method , the agreement for the vb and v2 is perfect .",
    "in addition , it is apparent that the tb+soc provides a fairly good quantitative agreement for the spin splitting of the conduction and v1 bands , except for wse@xmath0 . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we compare @xmath27 for dft+soc and tb+soc along the @xmath28 high symmetry points .",
    "it is apparent that the tb method captures the non - trivial momentum dependence featured by the dft+soc , although there is a systematic off - set which is also larger for wse@xmath0 .",
    "we are now in a position to discuss the mechanism for the conduction band splitting in the tmd monolayers .",
    "inspection of the @xmath29 values in table [ tab2 ] reveals , that @xmath30 should vanish to first order in @xmath13 , and have a small linear contribution in @xmath14 . to check this out we plot in fig .",

    "is a straight line with negative slope .",
    "this can be understood within 1st order perturbation theory , that yields the following expression for the chalcogen atom soc contribution to the splitting : @xmath34 where the negative sign comes from the fact that , at the @xmath5 point , the cb bloch state overlaps with the @xmath35 chalcogenide atomic like state ( see table [ tab2 ] ) . with this equation",
    "the negative slopes @xmath36 in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) became clear .",
    "they are controlled by @xmath37 ( see table [ tab2 ] ) , and are the same for the tungsten based ws@xmath0 and wse@xmath0 compounds as well as molybdenum based mos@xmath0 and mose@xmath0 compounds .",
    "( color online ) spin - orbit splitting of the conduction band at the @xmath5 point calculate for the considered tmd mls as a function of @xmath13 ( a ) and @xmath14 ( b ) parameters in the .",
    "the corresponding @xmath14 ( a ) and @xmath13 ( b ) parameters are fixed to the values estimated with the tb+soc method ( see table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "bold dots mark the @xmath13 and @xmath14 parameters calculated with the same method.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    in contrast , the @xmath38 dependence ( for @xmath39 ) is not linear reflecting the inter band character of this contribution and has a positive sign .",
    "of course , opposite signs and trends are found at the @xmath40 point , on account of time reversal symmetry .",
    "the well defined sign of the inter - band contribution to the cb spin splitting is understood as follows .",
    "first , we use second order perturbation theory , that yields positive ( negative ) shifts via inter - band coupling to states below ( above ) in energy .",
    "second , given the fact that at the @xmath5 point the bloch states overlap with states with a well defined handedness , together with the angular momentum conservation , result in a spin - selective inter band coupling .",
    "thus , the tm soc can connect the cb state ( @xmath41 ) with spin @xmath42 only to the states with the opposite values of @xmath43 ( @xmath441 ) and spin ( @xmath45 ) , which happen to be available at the band v1 , providing a positive contribution of the shift given by @xmath46 whereas the coupling of the cb to v1 give a null shift of @xmath47 .",
    "in contrast , the cb state with spin @xmath45 , can only connect to states with @xmath48 , which happen to be available at the c1 state , giving a negative shift to the @xmath45 level and thereby another positive contribution to the splitting : @xmath49    we now define @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "combining eq . (",
    "[ 1st - cb])-([second - ordercc1 ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ wfunc ] ) , using @xmath52 and @xmath53 , with @xmath4=c1,v1 , we can write the following perturbative expression for the cb spin splitting at the @xmath5 valley : @xmath54 however , since @xmath55 ev and @xmath56 ev , the two terms proportional to @xmath57 are positive .",
    "the values of @xmath31 calculated with eq .",
    "( [ delta_c ] ) for the four tmd mls are listed in table [ tab1 ] ( see row pt ) .",
    "it is apparent that the perturbative calculation captures the trend of the non - perturbative results calculation result and provides a qualitative insight of the contribution of each atom to the conduction band splitting .    in summary ,",
    "the cb splitting has two contributions with opposite signs . for the k valley",
    ", the chalcogen soc gives a negative contribution and the transition metal a positive one .",
    "this explains the material dependent sign .",
    "thus , ws@xmath0 combines the largest positive with the smallest negative contribution , resulting in a clearly positive splitting . on the opposite side",
    ", mose@xmath0 combines the smaller tm soc and the largest ch soc , resulting in the largest negative contribution . in mos@xmath0",
    "the two competing contributions are the smallest ( comparing to the other considered mls ) and go a long way to cancel each other : sulphur alone would give @xmath58 mev whereas mo alone would give @xmath59 mev .",
    "we now discuss some of the limitations of our model .",
    "first , it is apparent that the agreement between the tb+soc model and the dft+soc results is not good in the case wse@xmath0 .",
    "this is reflected in the discrepancy of the cb spin splitting shown in table [ tab1 ] and in the large variations of the value of @xmath26 determined using perturbation theory and the non - peturbative method ( see table [ tab_lambdas ] ) .",
    "this is due in part to the truncation in the number of bands in the tb method .",
    "interband contributions to bands omitted in the tb model contribute to the spin - orbit splitting , and this effect is of course larger for wse@xmath0 for which both @xmath25 s are largest .    a second contribution to this discrepancy might arise from the fact that the mlwf are not exactly the same than atomic orbitals . however , the differences are large only in the interstitial region and should weakly affect the spin - orbit physics .",
    "in contrast , the loss of atomic symmetry in the interstitial region clearly explains why our attempts , not discussed above , to parametrize the wannier - tb hamiltonian with a slater koster@xcite parameters have failed .",
    "therefore , the method discussed in this paper needs to be modified in order to map the dft calculation into a tb model parametrized with a few slater koster parameters , in the line of recent work.@xcite a third missing ingredient in the tb+soc , compared to the dft+soc , are interatomic terms , as opposed to the intra - atomic contributions described in eq .",
    "( [ ham_soc ] ) .    in summary ,",
    "dft calculations show that semiconducting two dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides have spin orbit splittings at the conduction band that although smaller than those at the valence band are definitely large enough to be relevant experimentally .",
    "@xcite in order to understand the chemical origin of the splitting , we have derived a tight - binding hamiltonian ( eq .",
    "( [ ham_soc2 ] ) ) using the maximally localized wannier functions as a basis . taking advantage of their atomic like character , it is possible to add the atomic spin orbit coupling operators to the tight - binding model , using the atomic @xmath25 as adjustable parameters .",
    "we have found that this method describes very well the bands in the energy range from -8 ev to 3 ev around the fermi level . the tight - binding model permits to determine that both types of atoms , metal and chalcogen , contribute to the conduction band spin splitting with opposite signs .",
    "this naturally explains why conduction band spin - orbit splittings of the ws@xmath0 and mose@xmath0 present opposite signs .",
    "our findings have implications on a wide array of spin related physical phenomena that are being explored in two dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides and their nanostructures,@xcite including the conduction band landau levels,@xcite spin relaxation , @xcite , exciton spin selection rules,@xcite rkky coupling , @xcite as well as the spin and valley hall effects . @xcite",
