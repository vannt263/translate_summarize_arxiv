    "for spin - based quantum computing @xcite , increasing research efforts have focused in recent years on c , si , and ge @xcite because they can be isotopically enriched to only contain nuclei with zero spin @xcite and thus exhibit exceptionally long spin lifetimes @xcite .",
    "the one - dimensional character of ge - si core - shell nanowires leads to unique electronic properties in the valence band , where heavy and light hole states are mixed @xcite .",
    "early experiments in ge - si core - shell nanowires include experiments on double quantum dots@xcite and spin relaxation times.@xcite the band mixing causes an enhanced rashba - type spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) @xcite , which can be exploited for efficient spin manipulation@xcite .",
    "therefore ge - si core - shell nanowires are an ideal platform for future quantum computation applications .    in this letter",
    ", we define single quantum dots of several lengths in a ge - si core - shell nanowire .",
    "we controllably split longer quantum dots up into double quantum dots with tuneable interdot tunnel coupling .",
    "both single and double quantum dots show an exceptional degree of measurement stability .",
    "we will discuss measurements in two different devices _",
    "d1 _ and _ d2 _ ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sdqd_device ] ) on two different chips , which have been fabricated in the same way : a p@xmath0-doped si substrate is covered with sio@xmath1 , on which six bottom gates _",
    "g1_-_g6 _ with pitch are patterned with electron beam lithography ( ebl ) . before metallization of the bottom gates ,",
    "a 13  s buffered hydrofluoric acid dip etches 20  nm deep trenches into the sio@xmath1 , so that the bottom gates ( approximately 20  nm thick ) are sunken into the sio@xmath1for an improved planarity .",
    "the gates are covered with al@xmath1o@xmath2grown with atomic layer deposition at .",
    "two single nanowires with a si shell thickness of   and a ge core radius of   ( _ d1 _ ) and ( _ d2 _ ) are deterministically placed on top of the gate structure with a micromanipulator . based on transmission electron microscopy studies of similar wires , both the core and the shell",
    "are monocrystalline , and their axis is likely pointed along the @xmath3110@xmath4 crystal axis.@xcite subsequently we define ohmic contacts to the nanowires and gate contacts made of ti / pd ( ) with ebl .",
    "the nanowire parts above the bottom gates are at no point exposed to the electron beam , preventing carbon deposition and introduction of defects into the otherwise defect - free ge core .",
    "all measurements are performed using dc electronic equipment in a dilution refrigerator with a base temperature of 8  mk .",
    "a bias voltage @xmath5 is applied to source , the current @xmath6 is measured at the drain contact .",
    "an effective hole temperature of @xmath7 has been determined in one of the devices by measuring the temperature dependence of the coulomb peak width.@xcite    ( dark red ) , six bottom gates g1-g6 ( light red ) , each   wide and with a pitch of .",
    "the bottom gates are buried under of al@xmath1o@xmath2(yellow ) , on top of which the nanowire is deposited ( green ) and ohmic contacts ( ti / pd , blue ) are defined.[fig : sdqd_device ] ]",
    "by using different gates to induce tunnel barriers we can form quantum dots in our nanowire with lengths varying from very long quantum dots ( using _ g1 _ and _ g6 _ ) to very short dots ( using adjacent gates ) .",
    "this flexible quantum dot length together with a tuneable tunnel coupling between the quantum dot and the reservoirs is a great improvement compared to using lateral heterostructures @xcite , or schottky barriers at the nanowire - metal interface with the contacts @xcite .",
    "we assume the length of our gate - defined quantum dots to be the the distance between the inner edges of the barrier gates . using a gate width of @xmath8",
    "this results in quantum dot lengths of @xmath9 for adjacent barrier gates , @xmath10 for barrier gates with one plunger gate in between , @xmath11 for two plunger gates , @xmath12 for three plunger gates , and @xmath13 for four plunger gates , i.e.we are able to tune the dot length over almost an order of magnitude .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sdqd_sqdlength](a)-(e ) we plot @xmath14 versus @xmath5 and the voltage on the plunger gate @xmath15 .",
    "the formation of quantum dots of five different lengths is reflected in the clear coulomb diamonds .",
    "the shortest quantum dot is formed in device _",
    "d1 _ [ fig .",
    "[ fig : sdqd_sqdlength](a ) ] .",
    "the quantum dots formed with one up to four plunger gates are formed in both devices _ d1 _ and _ d2 _ , figs .",
    "[ fig : sdqd_sqdlength](b)-(e ) display bias spectroscopies of quantum dots formed in _",
    "d2_.     ( left ) and total capacitance @xmath16 ( right ) of the dot plotted versus the dot length @xmath17 .",
    "red triangles measured in _ d1 _ , black circles in _ d2_. ]    we extract the respective charging energies @xmath18 for both devices from the coulomb diamond height and find a decreasing @xmath18 from to , inversely proportional to the increasing dot length [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : sdqd_sqdlength](f ) and tab .",
    "[ tab : sqd_parameters ] ] .",
    "since @xmath18 is linked to the total capacitance @xmath16 of the quantum dot via @xmath19,@xcite @xmath16 is directly proportional to the quantum dot length . @xmath18 and @xmath16 are highly consistent for the two devices .    for the quantum dot configurations with a dedicated plunger gate [ figs .",
    "[ fig : sdqd_sqdlength](b)-(e ) ] , @xmath18 as well as the shape of the coulomb diamonds stay constant over several charge transitions , reflecting the validity of the constant interaction model . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sdqd_sqdlength](a ) , @xmath18 increases significantly from to and also the slopes of the coulomb diamond edges change .",
    "we attribute this to using the right barrier gate as a plunger , leading to a decreasing dot size and changing capacitive couplings to this barrier gate and the adjacent reservoir .",
    "therefore , the constant interaction model is not valid in this configuration , and the tuneability of the quantum dot is limited compared to the longer quantum dots with a dedicated plunger gate .",
    "we extract the values for @xmath18 and @xmath16 for the zero - plunger configuration from the middle coulomb diamond , for which they are in line with those for the longer dots .",

    "[ fig : sdqd_dqd](b ) we show a high - resolution stability diagram of a double quantum dot wealky coupled to the reservoirs at @xmath20 with barrier gate voltages of @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 . clearly visible is a very regular pattern of 25 bias triangle pairs , from which we extract the gate - to - dot capacitances in the same way as before .",
    "we obtain @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and mutual capacitances of @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the increased values for @xmath28 indicate an indeed increased capacitive coupling between the dots .",
    "we extract the charging energies from fig .  [",
    "fig : sdqd_dqd](b ) by relating the bias triangle size to an energy of .",
    "we obtain a charging energy of the left dot @xmath29 and of the right dot @xmath30 . for the mutual charging energy @xmath31 we extract @xmath32 .",
    "the size and shape of the bias triangles are exceptionally stable over the whole range of the measurement .",
    "this underlines the high degree of control over the electrochemical potentials of the quantum dots as well as the tunnel and capacitive couplings .",
    "our devices are therefore exceptionally suitable for direct - transport experiments in comparison to other systems , where tunnel couplings change strongly when changing the charge occupation.@xcite such experiments are relevant , because the applied bias between the two reservoirs serves as an energy scale , which , e.g. , allows for the determination of the singlet - triplet splitting@xcite and the zeeman splitting.@xcite    in summary we demonstrate a high degree of control over the charge distribution in a double quantum dot .",
    "we have changed the mutual capacitances , a measure for the degree of separation of the dots , by a factor of six while keeping the capacitances between the left ( right ) dot and _ g3 _ ( _ g5 _ ) almost constant .",
    "the corresponding charging energies are in agreement with the experiments on single quantum dots of the same length in _ d2_.",
    "in conclusion , we have electrostatically formed highly - tunable single and double quantum dots inside ge - si core - shell nanowires .",
    "we can vary the length of the single quantum dots from to corresponding to charging energies of the quantum dots varying from @xmath33 down to @xmath34 .",
    "furthermore , we have split a single quantum dot into a double quantum dot in a controlled way .",
    "our low - cross - capacitance gate design enables us to keep the voltage on the outer barriers constant while varying the interdot barrier , i.e.it is not necessary to retune all gates . all capacitances and charging energies extracted from single and double quantum dot measurements are highly consistent .",
    "25 bias triangle pairs form a very regular pattern in the stability diagram with constant triangle sizes , indicating an exceptional degree of control over the tunnel couplings over a large range of gate voltages .",
