    "the ability to send data from one part of a computer to another accurately and quickly is an essential feature in virtually any design .",
    "the use of artificial spin clusters in quantum computing has been of growing interest .",
    "there is an implementation which has been demonstrated using superconducting flux q - bits@xcite .",
    "this paper demonstrates an effective and scalable way of sending arbitrary q - bit states along a spin chain with heisenberg type coupling using quantum annealing .",
    "assuming one could implement a hamiltonian which follows this model , for example using the methods proposed in @xcite using coupled cavities , this system design could be used for a data bus which transports quantum states to different sections of a quantum computer system . for instance , the protocols discussed in this paper could potentially be used to move states from memory to a system of quantum gates in an implementation of the circuit model",
    ".    there has already been significant work done on the subject of quantum data buses using spin chains , @xcite .",
    "however these works differ significantly from the method proposed in this paper in that the encoded q - bit is not transmitted through a degenerate ground state manifold , but through excitations of the hamiltonian .",
    "this paper investigates a method of using q - bits as an intermediate bus for the transfer of quantum information .",
    "this method can be compared to another method which is that of pulses @xcite , where a hamiltonian is applied to a system for a period of time to perform a given operation . in the case of information transfer",
    "this operation is usually a swap . unlike the method of using pulses , this method of using q - bits",
    "does not require precise timing to insure that the correct operation is performed .",
    "the method of using a spin chain hamiltonian as a data bus also means that one does not need to either be able to address any pair of q - bits in the system or perform multiple operations to transfer an arbitrary q - bit .",
    "the pulse method does have the advantage that every intermediate spin can be used as quantum memory .",
    "however this is at the cost of the increased complexity of using dynamic quantum evolution in excited states , and the requirement of precise timing .",
    "the adiabatic quantum bus method also has the advantage that , as in any adiabatic quantum process , only the lowest energy parts of hamiltonian need to be faithfully realised by the implementation method .",
    "for example , a hamiltonian which actually has an infinite number of excited states on each `` spin '' , but where only the low energy states which act like a spin @xmath0 heisenberg system , contribute to the ground state would be perfectly acceptable to use as an adiabatic quantum bus without modification .",
    "but the higher energy states may cause issues using a method such as pulses .",
    "this general feature of adiabatic quantum processes such as the one illustrated in this paper makes them more versatile than their non - adiabatic counterparts .",
    "the effect we will examine exploits the su(2 ) symmetry of the heisenberg hamiltonian and uses the ground state degeneracy created by this symmetry in a chain with an odd number of spins .",
    "it has already been demonstrated @xcite that disturbances can be sent an unlimited distance along such chains because of their degenerate ground state .",
    "this paper goes a step further and actually demonstrates how a specific state can be transported across the chain using a quantum annealing protocol .",
    "further investigation will also be provided into application of this method to systems such as the xyz spin chain which only have a @xmath1symmetry .",
    "the model we consider is the j1-j2 heisenberg spin chain with open boundaries ,    @xmath2    this model has su(2 ) symmetry , which is expressed by the hamiltonian being block diagonal , such that there are n+1 blocks each with @xmath3 states .",
    "each block represents all of the states with a given number , k , of up spins .",
    "if the number of spins in the model is odd , then the additional symmetry under a flip of the spins in the z direction , i.e. @xmath4 implies that all states of the hamiltonian have a twofold energy degeneracy . in the anti - ferromagnetic case , ( @xmath5 ) the ground state manifold consists of one state from the @xmath6 and one from the @xmath7 sector .",
    "a simple example of this would be taking a system with 5 spins , the ground state would be twofold degenerate and would span the k=2 and k=3 sectors .",
    "one can now consider an initial hamiltonian of the form of eq .",
    "[ eq : j1-j2 ] where the couplings are the ones given by    @xmath8    the general condition on @xmath9 and @xmath10 is that the coupling is predominantly anti - ferromagnetic everywhere and that each spin is coupled to the others by at least one non zero j. for simplicity this paper considers only @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "this ground state manifold consists of the tensor product of the ( unique ) ground state of the chain of length n-1 with the nth spin in an arbitrary state , a state in this manifold is of the from given by    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the ground state of the spin chain of length n-1 and @xmath15is an arbitrary single spin state .",
    "one can now consider the same hamiltonian , but with @xmath16 .",
    "this hamiltonian also has the form of eq .",
    "[ eq : j1-j2 ] , but with couplings    @xmath17    the general condition on @xmath18 and @xmath19 is that the coupling is predominantly anti - ferromagnetic everywhere and that each spin is coupled to the others by at least one non - zero j. for simplicity this paper considers only @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "a state in the ground state manifold is now given by    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is an arbitrary single spin state .",
    "one can now consider a quantum annealing process with described by    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is [ eq : j1-j2 ] with the conditions given in [ eq : j1 init ] and [ eq : j2 init ] and @xmath26 is [ eq : j1-j2 ] with the conditions given in [ eq : j1 fin ] and [ eq : j2 fin ] . also a and b follow the conditions @xmath27    for all values of a and b the su(2 ) symmetry is preserved .",
    "therefore the hamiltonian remains block diagonal at all times .",
    "the symmetry of the hamiltonian under @xmath4 is also preserved at all times .",
    "this implies that the ground - state degeneracy ( as well as the twofold degeneracy of all states ) is preserved .",
    "the block diagonal structure implies that there will be no exchange of amplitude between spin sectors during the annealing process , while the degeneracy implies that no relative phase can be acquired between the states in the @xmath6 and the @xmath7 sector . from the combination of these two conditions",

    "[ fig : transport cartoon ] .    ]",
    "the use of the j1-j2 heisenberg chain for transport by quantum annealing has several advantages .",
    "first the model with uniform coupling is gapped for @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that within the adiabatic evolution process , at least locally , the system should behave as a gapped system in this regime , as long as global effects such as odd length frustration do not cause problems .",
    "it is important to note that even the largest system size considered here is far from the thermodynamic limit .",
    "one should note , however , that given the connectivity schemes of adiabatic quantum chips already in existence @xcite , one may only need to transport a q - bit state a few spins to get it to any part of the system .",
    "further evidence of favorable scaling comes from @xcite which demonstrates that disturbances can travel an unlimited distance in the presence of a degenerate ground state , even in a gapped system .",
    "furthermore , @xcite suggests that these disturbances can carry entanglement , polarization , and quantum information .",
    "the transport by annealing given here is a specific example of how this effect can be taken advantage of .",
    "another advantage of the use of the j1-j2 heisenberg hamiltonian is the existence of the so called majumdar - ghosh point @xcite ( @xmath32 ) . at this point",
    "the ground state ( with an even number of spins ) has the simple form of a matrix product of singlets . due to this fact the system should be relatively easy to prepare .",
    "the system is also gapped at the majumdar - ghosh point , making the majumdar - ghosh heisenberg hamiltonian , an ideal system for transport by quantum annealing and the ideal candidate for building an adiabatic quantum data bus .",
    "although this paper focuses on the j1-j2 heisenberg model , it should be noted that this same annealing scheme should work with any pattern of coupling in the intermediate spins ( i.e. j1-j2-j3 ) .",
    "one would also expect this scheme to work in models where the su(2 ) symmetry is broken but there is a remaining @xmath1symmetry such as the xyz or xy model , again with arbitrary patterns of coupling .",
    "note however that this mehhod will not work in the ising model , because although there is a @xmath1 symmetry , the hamiltonian lacks terms to exchange q - bits between sites because it is diagonal in the computational basis .",
    "none of the arguments so far have given much illumination to the difficulty or ease of annealing within the sector . while we have discussed",
    "that transport of a q - bit state is possible in principle by annealing , we have not yet shown that the annealing process is fast enough to be practical .",
    "for this we turn to numerics . for the purposes of this paper",
    "we will consider the annealing time , @xmath33 , required to reach a given fixed fidelity , @xmath34 , with the true final ground state ,    @xmath35    the j1-j2 heisenberg model is not an analytically solved model , at least for finite values of @xmath36 , so numerical methods must be used in this calculation .",
    "one can first consider one part of the annealing process , in which a single spin is joined to a even length j1-j2 spin chain , using both @xmath37 and @xmath36 couplings which are linearly increased to equal values of those used in the rest of the chain , .",

    "[ fig : t_join ] , the annealing time required becomes large and highly sensitive to small variations for larger values of @xmath36 .",

    "fortunately there are many other possible options to take advantage of the easily prepared ground state and hopefully avoid the regions of small gap found here .",
