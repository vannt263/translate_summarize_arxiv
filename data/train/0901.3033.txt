    "decades after the experimental detection of the neutrino @xcite , it was generally accepted that the neutrino mass @xmath4 was rigorously zero . the crucial experiments with the 50 kton neutrino detector super - kamiokande found strong evidence for oscillations ( and hence - mass ) in the atmospheric neutrinos @xcite .",
    "the direct neutrino measurements allowed to bound the neutrino mass .",
    "the upper limit for the mass of the lightest neutrino flavor @xmath0 was obtained from experiments for measurement of the high - energy part of the tritium @xmath5-spectrum and recent experiments yielded @xmath6 upper limit @xcite . as a result of the recent experiments , the upper mass limits of @xmath7and @xmath8are @xmath9 kev @xcite and @xmath10 @xcite , respectively .",

    ". the astrophysical constraint of the neutrino mass is @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the recent extensions of the standard model lead to non - zero neutrino masses , which are within the large range of @xmath14 .    in the classical @xmath15 model",
    "the mass relations between charged leptons and down quark masses are simply identities : @xmath16 @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the mass relations of georgi - jarlskog @xcite ensue from the @xmath19 model and relate charged leptons and down quark masses : @xmath20 @xmath21 and @xmath18 .",
    "however , these mass relations deviate several times , compared to experimental data .",
    "moreover , similar mass relations are unsuited for neutral leptons ( neutrino ) masses .",
    "the seesaw mechanism naturally generates small majorana neutrino mass @xmath22 from reasonable dirac mass @xmath23 and very heavy majorana sterile neutrino mass @xmath24 , namely @xmath25 .",
    "but there are many seesaw models that differ in the scale @xmath24 and dirac mass .",

    "based on the experimental data , we search for a simple relation between the masses of charged leptons ( @xmath49 ) and the respective up quarks ( @xmath50 ) by the least squares .",
    "although the linear regression @xmath51 @xmath3 shows close correlation , it yields electron mass many times lower than the experimental value .",
    "after examination of other simple approximations ( logarithmic , exponential and power law ) we found out that the power law fits best experimental data :    @xmath52    where @xmath53 and @xmath54    despite the large uncertainty of the @xmath55 quark mass ( from @xmath56 to @xmath57 @xmath58 ) and @xmath59 quark mass ( from @xmath60 to @xmath61 ) , the slope remains within the narrow interval from 0.683 to 0.782 .",
    "although only three points make the approximation , the correlation coefficient is very high ( @xmath62 ) and the maximal ratio of the predicted mass in relation to the respective experimental value is @xmath63 @xmath64 ( for muon ) .",
    "the predicted masses of the electron and tau lepton differ from the respective experimental values with less than 40% .",
    "therefore , the mass relation ( [ eqn2 ] ) could be accepted satisfactory .",
    "we suggest that a mass relation similar to ( [ eqn2 ] ) connects the masses of the neutral leptons ( @xmath65 ) and the respective down quarks ( @xmath66 ) :    @xmath67    where @xmath68 and @xmath69 is an unknown constant .    for @xmath70 formula ( [ eqn3 ] ) yields",
    "@xmath71 @xmath58 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 @xmath58 .",
    "these values are several orders of magnitude bigger than the experimental upper limits of the neutrino masses ( see table 1 ) , therefore @xmath74 .",
    "astrophysical constraints allow to limit more closely the value of _ k _ since they give @xmath75 @xmath3 .",

    "these results support the normal hierarchy of neutrino masses .",
    "on the other hand , the large mixing angle ( _ lma _ ) of mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( _ msw _ ) solution for _ sne _ @xcite yields :    @xmath83    this equation , together ( [ eqn6 ] ) and ( [ eqn7 ] ) , yield @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 @xmath3 .",
    "these values are almost three times bigger than the values obtained by super kamiokande data , therefore , they do not fit well with the latter . however , the small mixing angle ( _ sma _ ) _ msw _ solution for _ sne _ @xcite yields :    @xmath87    this equation , together ( [ eqn6 ] ) and ( [ eqn7 ] ) , yield @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "these values differ by less than 25% from the results obtained above by super kamiokande data , which show that according to the suggested approach , _ sma msw _ solution fits better with the _ ane _ than _ lma msw_.    thus , the obtained quark - lepton mass relations and the results of the solar and atmospheric neutrino experiments provide to estimate the masses of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 of @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "these values are close to the neutrino masses ( @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 ) found in @xcite by the mass relation , connecting the masses of four stable particles and the coupling constants of the fundamental interactions .",
    "we could calculate constant @xmath69 using the most trustworthy data for neutrinos and down quarks masses , namely @xmath2 and @xmath36-quark masses :    @xmath97    [ t ]    fig1.png    the obtained mass relations ( [ eqn2 ] ) and ( [ eqn3 ] ) are shown in fig .",
