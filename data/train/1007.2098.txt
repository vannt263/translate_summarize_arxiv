    "electron - phonon ( ep ) interaction is responsible of many important phenomena in solids . as an example , the temperature behavior of the electron relaxation time in metals is to a great extent due to the scattering between carriers and atomic vibrations @xcite such that finite temperature transport is largely ruled by the ep interaction .",
    "similarly , the high temperature heat capacity in metals is enhanced by the increased electronic mass due to the interaction with lattice vibrations @xcite .",
    "in metals , at low temperatures , ep coupling can generate a superconducting state in which electrons move with no electrical resistance @xcite .",
    "it also can increase the effective mass of the carriers so much that the system is driven from a metallic to an insulating state , as it happens in case of polaronic or peierls instabilities @xcite . finally , the electron - phonon scattering is often the largest source of phonon damping in phonon - mediated superconductors @xcite .",
    "first - principles theoretical determination of the electron - phonon coupling strength in solids requires the calculation of the electronic structure , the vibrational properties , and the electron - phonon coupling matrix elements . in state - of - the - art electronic structure calculations",
    "these quantities are obtained using the adiabatic born - oppenheimer approximation @xcite and density - functional theory ( dft ) in the linear - response approach @xcite .",
    "more specifically , within the born - oppenheimer approximation , the determination of phonon frequencies , that are related to the real part of the phonon self - energy , requires the calculation , _ in a self - consistent manner _ , of the variation of the kohn - sham potential @xmath3 with respect to a _",
    "static _ ionic displacement @xmath4 @xcite , namely @xmath5 . as the displacement of the ions is static",

    "conversely , the phonon linewidth , related to the imaginary part of the phonon self - energy , is obtained in a _",
    "non self - consistent _ procedure using the electron charge density and the previously determined @xmath5 .",
    "the advantage of using a non self - consistent procedure to study phonon linewidth is mainly related to the less expensive computational load with respect to a self - consistent one .",
    "in addition , as recently demonstrated , interpolation schemes @xcite of the electron - phonon matrix elements can be used to calculate the imaginary part of the phonon self - energy on ultra - dense k - point grid .",
    "it is however unclear to what extent this procedure of calculating self - consistently the real part of the phonon self - energy and non self - consistently the imaginary part is actually correct .",
    "indeed , the proper way of treating phonons should be to consider a monochromatic time - dependent displacement ( at the phonon frequency @xmath6 ) and perform a time - dependent self - consistent linear - response scheme .",
    "the resulting variation of the self - consistent potential @xmath7 would then be a complex quantity .",
    "the real part of the resulting phonon self - energy would then determine the phonon frequencies while its imaginary part would lead to the phonon linewidth .",

    "although feasible in principle this procedure would require a full rewriting of the linear response code including time dependence and it would also be more expensive then a standard static linear - response calculation",
    ". moreover , in the presence of kohn anomalies and long - range force - constants , where extremely accurate k - point sampling of the fermi surface is needed to converge the phonon self - energy , the calculation would be unfeasible .",
    "thus , it would be desirable to have a non -self consistent linear - response formulation to obtain both the real and imaginary phonon self - energy , both within the adiabatic / static and non - adiabatic / dynamic approximation .    in this work",
    "we develop a scheme to calculate non self - consistently both the real and the imaginary part of the phonon self - energy by using a functional that is variational with respect to the variation of the self - consistent charge density .",
    "our method opens the way to calculate adiabatic / static and non - adiabatic / dynamic phonon frequencies using an ultra - dense sampling of the electron and phonon wave - vector in a non self - consistent way , starting from the static self - consistent variation of the time independent kohn - sham potential ( @xmath5 ) , obtained with a coarse sampling . in this way , the main computational load related to phonon frequencies calculation is drastically reduced .",
    "the efficiency of the method is further enhanced by using the interpolation of the electron - phonon matrix elements @xcite based on wannier functions @xcite .",
    "the method is applied to study the dynamical and superconducting properties of mgb@xmath0 and cac@xmath1 , two of the most studied superconducting materials in the last few years .",

    "in fact , although many experimental and theoretical studies appeared , there are still important open issues and debated results .    for example",
    ", conflicting results for the calculate mgb@xmath0 electron - phonon coupling ( @xmath8 ) are present in the literature mainly due to difficulties in brillouin zone sampling .",

    "this continuous improvement of the theoretical explanation of the normal and superconducting properties of mgb@xmath0 was in part due to some difficulties in the proper calculations of the electron - phonon coupling and of the phonon frequencies .",
