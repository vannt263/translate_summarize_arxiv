    "there are two principal reasons why density functionals should be constructed to satisfy known exact constraints .",
    "the first is idealistic : our approximations should not needlessly violate what we know to be true .",
    "the second is practical : satisfaction of many constraints helps the approximation to work over a wider range of densities .",
    "for example , functionals that are constructed only by fitting to molecular data are less accurate for solids than functionals that satisfy solid - state - like constraints such as the uniform gas limit  @xcite , which by itself fully defines the first or lsda rung of the ladder .    at the second or gga rung ,",
    "the constraints are already less constraining .",

    "even for a chosen set of constraints , there may be quite different ways in which they can be satisfied  @xcite .",
    "thus , the nonempirical ggas are in practice guided by some additional physical postulate . for the pbe gga ,",
    "this guiding postulate is the sharp ( atomic - like ) cutoff of the spurious long - range part of the gradient expansion for the exchange - correlation hole  @xcite .",
    "for the pbesol gga for solids , it is restoration of the gradient expansion for the exchange energy over a wide range of slowly- or moderately - varying densities  @xcite .",
    "we close this introduction by summarizing some of the successes and failures of the tpss meta - gga , the nonempirical functional on the highest semilocal rung of the ladder . for the standard enthalpies of formation of the 223 molecules of the g3/99 test set  @xcite ( including cof@xmath27 ) , the mean absolute error ( mae ) computed self - consistently using the fully uncontracted 6 - 311++g(3df,3pd )",

    "thus , atoms and molecules at equilibrium , with integer electron numbers , are predominantly normal systems in which the errors of semilocal exchange and semilocal correlation tend to cancel .",
    "this does _ not _ mean that semilocal functionals always predict realistic binding energy curves .",
    "in fact , they do so only when the fragments have integer electron numbers .",
    "asymmetric molecules , when described by semilocal functionals , often dissociate to fragments of spurious fractional charge , for which the energy is seriously too low ( ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "even when the fractional charge is real , as in the dissociation of x@xmath28 , the self - interaction error of semilocal functionals makes the energy seriously too low ( ref .  , and references therein ) at the dissociation limit x@xmath29x@xmath30 , where it ought to be equal to that of x@xmath31x@xmath32 .",
    "the combination of stretched bonds and noninteger average ( hence fluctuating ) electron numbers on the fragments makes for a highly abnormal valence region .",
    "a milder version of the same abnormality is found for the moderately stretched bonds in the transition state of a chemical reaction , where semilocal functionals predict reaction barriers that are too low or even negative .",

    "from this fact , it is already clear that the known exact constraints do not tell us how much full nonlocality is needed in correlation for compatibility with exact exchange .",
