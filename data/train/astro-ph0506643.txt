    "recently @xmath0 cephei pulsators have proven to be very promising targets for asteroseismic purposes . besides the derivation of strong constraints on the mass and metallicity , among other global parameters , the fitting of three independent observed frequencies constrained the core overshooting parameter of the @xmath0 cephei stars v836 cen and . moreover , from the observation of two multiplets , non - rigid rotation was proven for both stars ( aerts et al.@xcite , dupret et al.@xcite and pamyatnykh et al.@xcite ) .",
    "in addition , it has been shown that non - standard stellar models have to be invoked in order to fit four independent frequencies of ( ausseloos et al.@xcite ) .    by increasing the number of such asteroseismic studies of additional @xmath0 cephei target stars ,",
    "it is clear that our understanding of the internal structure of these massive stars will significantly improve in the near future . in this framework",
    "a three - site photometric campaign as well as a long - term spectroscopic monitoring were dedicated to the b2iv @xmath0 cephei star ( hd157056 , v@xmath10 = 3.248 ) .",
    "the detailed analyses of the gathered photometric and spectroscopic observations are respectively described by handler et al.@xcite , hereafter paperi , and in the present paper .    in paperi ,",
    "the frequency analysis and mode identification from 1303 colour photometric measurements show the presence of one radial mode , one rotationally split @xmath11 triplet and possibly three components of a rotationally split @xmath12 quintuplet .",
    "such a pulsation spectrum is similar to the one observed for v836 cen ( aerts et al.@xcite ) .",
    "consequently fruitful results can be expected from our asteroseismic study devoted to .",
    "the present paper describes the detailed analysis of our spectroscopic data with the main aim of identifying the @xmath4-value of the mode with the highest amplitude , belonging to the quintuplet . in that way we can add an independent",
    "well identified mode to the radial one and the central mode of the triplet already detected .",
    "such an identification will allow seismic modelling of the star , which will be done in the near future .",
    "the spectroscopic variability of , as well as the main period of some 0.14 days , have been known for a long time but no spectroscopic mode identification was yet attempted .",
    "radial velocity variations with a main period of 0.2862d were first discovered by henroteau(@xcite ) . from new radial velocity measurements , van hoof",
    "et al.@xcite suggested a period of 0.15d , which corresponds to about half henroteau s period .",
    "they also noticed that the mean velocity at the time of their observations was @xmath13 , a value distinctly different from henroteau s values of 1920 and 1922 , which were 0 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "mcnamara@xcite and afterwards van hoof and blaauw @xcite confirmed the period found by van hoof et al.@xcite and refined it to 0.1404d .    from their radial velocities measurements of members of",
    "the sco - cen association levato et al.@xcite suspected to be a single - lined spectroscopic binary but they could not derive orbital elements .",
    "moreover , mcalister et al.@xcite detected to be a speckle binary and handler et al.@xcite determined that the speckle companion must be a b5 main sequence star .    in the literature ,",
    "values for the projected rotational velocity @xmath15 of were derived .",
    "brown and verschueren@xcite measured @xmath16 and abt et al.@xcite found @xmath17 for our studied star , compatible with the previous result .    the paper is organized as follows . in section2",
    "we give a description of our observations and data reductions .",
    "in section3 we show that the primary has a low - mass spectroscopic companion besides the distant speckle companion and we derive orbital parameters .",
    "section4 is devoted to the frequency analysis on our data after removing the orbit , followed by the identification of the wavenumbers @xmath18 for the main frequency @xmath1 . in section5",
    "we derive the position of in the hertzsprung - russel diagram . in section6",
    "we end the paper with a summary .",
    "our spectroscopic data were obtained with the coralie chelle spectrograph attached to the 1.2 m leonard euler telescope in la silla in chile , during several runs spread over 2000 - 2003 .",
    "we also have at our disposal some measurements gathered with the feros and giraffe chelle spectrographs attached respectively to the eso 2.2 m telescope ( la silla , chile ) and to the saao 1.9 m telescope ( south africa ) .",

    "we did a more precise correction for the pixel - to - pixel sensitivity variations by using all available flatfields obtained during the night instead of using only one flatfield , as is done by the on - line reduction procedure .",
    "the feros data reduction was performed using the on - line feros reduction pipeline which makes use of the eso - midas software package .",
    "this reduction includes consecutively the extraction of the inter - order background of the chelle spectra , the straightening and extracting of the orders , the removal of the blaze function and the pixel - to - pixel variations , the rebinning of the orders to the wavelength scale by using thar calibration spectra and a merging of the chelle orders .",
    "we performed an additional correction for the wavelength sensitivity of the shape of the internal flatfields by means of a smoothed average of dome flatfields .",
    "the giraffe spectra were reduced by using the giraffe pipeline reduction program xspec2 , which follows a similar procedure as the feros pipeline reduction .",
    "the spectra of a thar arc lamp , taken at regular intervals to calibrate possible drifts in wavelength , and two different types of flatfields were used for the reduction .",
    "we note that bias frames were not separately taken as the bias value was calculated from the overscan region on the ccd .",
    "flatfielding was accomplished by using camera flats , which were obtained by illuminating the camera with uniform light using a tungsten filament lamp and a diffusing screen .",
    "the blaze correction was determined by measuring the response across each order when the fibre was illuminated by the tungsten lamp ( fibre flats ) .",
    "finally , all spectra were normalized to the continuum by a cubic spline function , and the heliocentric corrections were computed .",
    "for our study of the line - profile variability we used the siiii triplet around 4567  .",
    "we point out that an effective temperature of some 18400 k was derived in paperi for the b5 speckle companion , which implies that this companion contributes very little to the siiii lines . moreover , the astrometric data presented by mcalister et al.@xcite and by shatsky & tokovinin@xcite point towards an orbital period of order 100 yr , so our approximation that it shows no radial - velocity variation on a timescale of 3 years seems justified .",
    "we computed the first three velocity moments , and ( see aerts et al.@xcite for a definition of the moments of a line profile ) of the siiii 4553   line with the aim of performing a frequency analysis .",
    "the integration boundaries of the moments were dynamically determined by visual inspection of each spectrum in order to avoid noisy continuum . to perform the frequency analysis on the first moment , which is the radial velocity placed at average zero",
    ", we used the pdm method ( stellingwerf@xcite ) and the scargle method ( scargle@xcite ) .",
    "we tested frequencies from 0 to 10 cycles per day ( ) with a frequency step of @xmath19 .",
    "the error estimate of our determined frequencies is between 0.0001 and 0.001 .",
    "we obtained the same results with both methods .",
    "the frequency that dominates the radial velocity is 0.0175 .",
    "such a long period of some 57 days does not belong to the pulsation period range of @xmath0 cephei stars and is too long to be the rotation period of a star with @xmath17 and @xmath20 .",
    "consequently we attributed this variability with a peak - to - peak amplitude of @xmath21 to binarity .    in order to derive the orbital parameters of the binary system we used the code fotel developed by hadrava@xcite .",
    "the program fotel is designed to solve either simultaneously or separately light- and radial velocity curves of binary stars with a possible distant third component .",
    "for we only used radial velocity measurements because there is no sign of the binarity in photometric measurements at our disposal in paperi .",
    "we found an orbital period of @xmath22 days with eccentricity @xmath23 .",
    "the other orbital elements and their standard errors are listed in table[elements ] . the phase diagram with respect to @xmath24",
    "is shown in fig.[orbit ] .",
    "if we consider that the orbital inclination @xmath25 corresponds to the inclination of the primary @xmath26 , the result of the mode identification described in section4.2 leads to @xmath25 in the interval [ 70@xmath27,90@xmath27 ] . with a mass for the primary component of some 9 @xmath29 ( see paperi ) , we conclude that the secondary component has a mass lower than 1 @xmath29 .",
    "we note that the duty cycle of the photometric data in paperi is not sufficient to detect a possible eclipse .",

    "while the tertiary contributes significantly to the spectrum of the triple system , its siiii lines are so weak that they must be situated completely within those of the primary .",
    "we have no information about possible variability of the tertiary . in any case",
    ", should it be a rotational or a pulsational variable star , we expect its frequency range to be vastly different from the one of the primary , given its mid - b spectra type .",
    "its presence will therefore not affect the pulsational interpretation of the primary we present below .",
    "a similar situation of having a companion spectral line within the one of the primary occurs for the @xmath40cephei star @xmath40crucis ( aerts et al.@xcite ) .      after removing the orbit we searched for additional frequencies in the residual radial velocities by subsequent prewhitening .",

    "note that @xmath5 is the frequency already detected in previous spectroscopic observations of and both frequencies correspond to those found in photometric measurements in paperi . in the radial velocity and in the higher order moments we could not find any additional frequency after prewhitening with @xmath5 and @xmath41 .",

    "according to the criterion given by briquet & aerts@xcite , we only needed to test @xmath79 .",
    "the results of the mode identification are given in table[mom ] .",
    "the lower the discriminant @xmath77 , the better the agreement between theoretical and observed moment values . we can conclude that the mode identification by means of the moment method favours an @xmath80 . since the photometric mode identification described in paperi excludes an @xmath81 , the mode identification gives a preference to @xmath7 or @xmath82 .",

    "we conclude that we can not discriminate between @xmath7 or @xmath82 and the solution @xmath83 gives a theoretical second moment amplitude slightly too large compared to the observed one .",
    "we also computed observed and theoretical moments up to order 6 in order to attempt to discriminate between the different solutions , as could be done for several slowly pulsating b stars by de cat et al.(@xcite ) .",
    "the solutions with @xmath84 and @xmath82 give very similar first six moments and the solution with @xmath83 shows a slightly less good fit to the even moments .      in order to discriminate between the best moment solutions we also used the amplitude and phase distributions shown in fig.[amp_phase ] ( see telting and schrijvers@xcite , schrijvers and telting@xcite for a definition ) .",

    "because generating line - profile variations is very time consuming , even with nowadays computers , we performed this procedure for the frequency @xmath5 and for couples @xmath84 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 since our goal is to discriminate between these possible @xmath18 for the main mode .",

    "these observed spectral lines were compared with theoretical ones for both the primary and tertiary computed for spherically symmetric non - local thermodynamic equilibrium ( nlte ) atmosphere models by means of the fastwind code in the version of puls et al.@xcite . the main input parameters to obtain the theoretical profile are @xmath93 , @xmath94 , the microturbulent velocity and the particle number ratios @xmath100(he)/@xmath100(h ) , @xmath100(si)/@xmath100(si@xmath101 ) .",

    "the application of asteroseismic techniques will be described in a following paper .",
    "we can summarize our findings as follows .",
    "the 1303 colour photometric three - site data obtained during 77 nights of observation allowed the authors of paperi to detect seven pulsation modes within a narrow frequency interval between 7.116 and 7.973 @xmath106 . our less numerous data of 121 spectra were obtained during three years and allowed us to discover a low - mass spectroscopic companion of the b2 primary and to determine an orbital period of some 57 days .",
    "the presence of a speckle b5 companion was already known so that we can conclude that is a triple system .",
    "moreover , we could recover three of the seven pulsation frequencies of the primary observed in photometry by means of a frequency analysis on the radial velocity but also from a two dimensional frequency search on the line profiles themselves .",
    "the photometric and spectroscopic mode identifications turned out to be complementary and fully consistent with each other .",
    "the colour photometry attributed unambiguously the frequency 7.4677 @xmath106 to a radial mode , which is corroborated by spectroscopy .",
    "two multiplets are also identified in photometry : one complete @xmath11 triplet , which is not observed in the spectroscopic data at our disposal , as well as three components of an @xmath12 quintuplet , of which we detected two components in our spectroscopic data . because this quintuplet is not complete ,",
    "there are still two possibilities for the @xmath4-values of the observed @xmath47 modes .",
    "this ambiguity was lifted thanks to our spectroscopic mode identification , taking into account the photometric identification of the radial mode . by comparing the observed first three moments of the siiii 4553   line as well as the observed amplitude and phase variations across this silicon line to the same theoretically computed quantities for several wavenumbers @xmath18 and for a large grid of continuous parameters",
    ", we identified the main mode with frequency 7.1160 @xmath106 as a non - axisymmetric @xmath84 mode and consequently we fixed the mode identifications of the whole quintuplet .",
    "the position of the primary in the hertzsprung - russel diagram was also photometrically and spectroscopically determined , leading to compatible stellar parameter values .",
    "these observational results form a good starting point for in - depth seismic modelling of the star .",
    "in particular , since its frequency spectrum is so similar to the one of , we have the opportunity to test if the occurence of core overshooting and non - rigid rotation found for that star ( aerts et al.@xcite , dupret et al.@xcite ) also applies to .",

    "<S> we present the results of a detailed analysis of 121 ground - based high - resolution high s / n spectroscopic measurements spread over 3 years for the @xmath0 cephei star . </S>",
    "<S> we discovered to be a triple system . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the already known speckle b5 companion of the b2 primary , we showed the presence of a low - mass spectroscopic companion and we derived an orbital period of 56.71 days with an eccentricity of 0.1670 . after removing the orbit we determined two frequencies for the primary in the residual radial velocities : @xmath1 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we also found the presence of @xmath3 by means of a two dimensional frequency search across the siiii 4567   profiles . </S>",
    "<S> we identified the @xmath4-value of the main mode with frequency @xmath5 by taking into account the photometric identifications of the degrees @xmath6 . by means of the moment method and the amplitude and phase variations across the line profile </S>",
    "<S> , we derived @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> this result allows us to fix the mode identifications of the whole quintuplet for which three components were detected in photometry . </S>",
    "<S> this is of particular use for our forthcoming seismic modelling of the primary . </S>",
    "<S> we also determined stellar parameters of the primary by non - local thermodynamic equilibrium hydrogen , helium and silicon line profile fitting and we obtained @xmath8 k and @xmath9 , which is consistent with photometrically determined values .    </S>",
