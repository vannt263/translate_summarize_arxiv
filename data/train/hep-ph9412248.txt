    "in recent years there has been a considerable interest@xcite , both theoretical and experimental , in the study of the @xmath7 meson and its interactions with the nucleon . suggestions@xcite",
    "have been made for using the @xmath7 to probe @xmath16 quark component in the nucleon wave function .",
    "also there is a rising interest in the measurement of rare and forbidden decays of @xmath7@xcite as a test of physics beyond the standard model . in the present work ,",
    "focus is on photoproduction of the eta meson and the role of production and decay of the @xmath0 resonance ( the so - called @xmath17(1535 ) in the pion - nucleon phase - shift analysis ) of spin @xmath18 and odd parity .",
    "this resonance has a remarkably large @xmath19 branching ratio , a fact that needs explanation in the theories of hadron structure based on quantum chromodynamics ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "it lies only @xmath21 above the @xmath19 threshold , and is the dominant contributor to the photoproduction amplitude even at threshold .",
    "in contrast to the low energy @xmath22 and @xmath23 interactions , where values of scattering lengths imply a repulsive interaction@xcite , the @xmath19 scattering length obtained in the analysis@xcite of @xmath24 suggests an attractive interaction between @xmath7 and @xmath25 .",
    "more recently , the analysis of the @xmath26 near threshold suggests a possibility of an attractive @xmath27 interaction and may also lead to the formation of `` bound '' @xmath7-nucleus states@xcite .",
    "an ideal tool for the study of the @xmath0 is through electromagnetic processes , as we demonstrate in this work .",
    "the eta meson is a member of the ground state su@xmath28 meson nonet .",
    "thus , the study of eta photoproduction , the subject of this paper , shares many of the fundamental motivations of the extensive study of pion photoproduction over the past twenty years or so , including those done at rpi , both theoretically@xcite and experimentally@xcite .",
    "these and other related studies have provided an impressive amount of information about the dynamical properties of the @xmath29 as an isolated quantum mechanical system , and its behavior inside the complex nucleus . above this resonance region , however , large background contributions@xcite , and the overlapping of higher resonances make studying one specific resonance by pion production mechanisms very difficult . just as the dominance of the @xmath29 in the @xmath30 processes have allowed the extraction of quantitative information on its electromagnetic transition amplitudes , we hope to extract similar information on @xmath0 via the @xmath31 process@xcite .",
    "this is an important focus of this paper .",
    "these photocoupling amplitudes provide useful tests for realistic hadron models inspired by qcd .",
    "most of the older data on photoproduction of the eta meson on protons come from the experiments done in the late sixties and early seventies@xcite-@xcite .",
    "these have been reviewed by genzel , joos and pfeil@xcite , and baldini@xcite .",
    "the existing older experimental data are neither very consistent nor complete in kinematic coverage .",
    "there are large ranges of photon energies and scattering angles , where no data on differential cross section exist at present .",
    "the available old data base on differential cross section on photoproduction@xcite-@xcite contains 137 points , most of which are for center of momentum ( c.m . ) energy below @xmath32 .",
    "only one polarization observable , the recoil proton polarization , has been measured@xcite , but is too poor ( seven data points , of which five are at @xmath33 ) to be of much theoretical value . to this , some more data , of limited quantity ( @xmath34 differential cross - section data points ) , have been added by homma _",
    "et al._@xcite covering the photon lab energy region from @xmath35 to @xmath36 .",
    "this data set has large energy uncertainties of the order @xmath37 and the angular resolution is @xmath38 .",
    "more recently , members of the pittsburgh - boston - lanl collaboration at bates@xcite have been able to measure the angular distribution for the ( @xmath39 ) reaction at photon lab energies of @xmath40 and @xmath41 at six angles each .",
    "to summarize , the data base for the eta photoproduction have not reached the relatively high level of accuracy known for pion photoproduction in the @xmath29 region .",
    "an equivalent multipole set , crucial in constraining theoretical models , _ does not exist_.    with the advent of high - duty cycle electron accelerators , such as the recently upgraded machines at the bates ( mass . ) , bonn , mainz , nikhef , and particularly , cebaf , just coming on - line , systematic and precise studies of the @xmath7 photoproduction over a wide range of energies , angles , and momentum transfers should become routine",
    ".    first round of experiments at the mainz microtron has been completed , and 45 new data points , as yet preliminary , have been added @xcite to the data base , covering the photon lab energies from @xmath42 to @xmath43 .",
    "this data set has the potential to make the existing data base almost irrelevant in future , due to better energy and angular resolutions , and statistics .",
    "existing theoretical analyses for the @xmath44 reaction are either based on a breit - wigner type parameterization@xcite or coupled channel isobar model@xcite . however , it is not clear how to interpret the couplings extracted in the latter work , as they yield  bare \" couplings that can not be related to the observable or physical couplings .",
    "most of these models have not only suffered from the crudeness of the data , but also from the lack of enough theoretical constraints in restricting the number of parameters fitted , 24 or more .",
    "recently , there was considerable excitement over the experiments at saclay@xcite and mainz@xcite on the pi - zero photoproduction near threshold .",
    "the results first seemed to indicate a dramatic discrepancy between the experimentally determined threshold amplitude@xcite @xmath45 and the theoretical prediction@xcite based on approximate chiral symmetry ( implying a useful low energy theorem , let ) .",
    "this triggered a considerable amount of work@xcite on possible corrections to the let .",
    "however , careful reanalyses@xcite concluded that there were no significant deviations from the let prediction for the multipole @xmath45 .",
    "given this intense theoretical discussion on the @xmath6 photoproduction , the @xmath7 photoproduction have taken an added interest@xcite , in view of the large chiral symmetry violation in the case of the eta meson .",
    "after the letter by two of us@xcite on the eta photoproduction has appeared , tiator , bennhold and kamalov@xcite have used a tree - level scheme motivated by our work .",
    "but there are important differences between our approach and theirs .",
    "first , these authors ignore the complexity of the spin-3/2 particles@xcite , u - channel resonance exchanges@xcite etc .",
    "thus , their treatment of background is quite different from ours .",
    "second , they have focused on the extraction of the eta - nucleon coupling constant .",
    "however , we do not agree with their primary conclusion that the eta photoproduction data determines the eta - nucleon coupling quite accurately .",
    "this difference between us is not surprising due to the point ( 1 ) .",
    "as we show below , the eta - nucleon coupling constant is not well determined from the data base that we have .",
    "we , instead , address here the physics of the @xmath46(1535 ) .",
    "finally , due to the multiple scattering effects , tiator _",
    "_   get bare couplings of the meson - baryon or photon - baryon vertices that can not be directly compared to hadron model predictions , or to those we extract in our paper .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to study photoproduction of the eta meson on protons from threshold through the @xmath0 resonance region in the effective lagrangian formalism , with a view to extract the product of the @xmath47 electromagnetic transition amplitude and the amplitude for the decay of the @xmath0 via the eta - nucleon channel , from the existing data .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : section ii is concerned with the formalism of photoproduction of the eta meson .",
    "kinematics , invariant amplitudes and multipole expansion are reviewed .",
    "section iii introduces the effective lagrangian formalism and the amplitudes arising from various particle exchanges are given in the tree approximation .",
    "this section is devoted to the photoproduction mechanism .",
    "some important theoretical issues associated with the treatment of the spin-@xmath48 baryons are also examined in this section .",
    "results , followed by a comparison between @xmath6 and @xmath7 photoproduction near threshold , are given in the section iv .",
    "section v summarizes our conclusions and poses some future research problems in this area .",
    "appendices provide some details of the theory , helpful for further understanding of the formalism .    in brief",
    ", this work explores the tree - level structure of the eta photoproduction in the @xmath0 region .",
    "the overwhelming dominance of the @xmath0 resonance , demonstrated below , should make the main results obtained in this paper , substantially immune from the unitarity corrections , ignored here .",
    "the reason for this optimism is that the breit - wigner form of the @xmath0 is already unitary , and other contributions are too small to be of great consequence in the unitarity violation .",
    "in order to fix the notation and the convention@xcite basic formulae for kinematics , invariant amplitudes , differential cross section and other observables are reviewed in this section .      in this work ,",
    "the following reaction of photoproduction of the @xmath7 meson on a nucleon is considered    @xmath49    where for each particle we have indicated the four - momentum in parentheses .",

    "energy is @xmath62 the threshold for the photoproduction of the eta meson is at the photon lab energy of @xmath63 , corresponding to a @xmath56 of @xmath64 .",
    "these contrast with the corresponding values for the neutral pion of @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the s - matrix elements for the elementary processes ( 1 ) can be written as@xcite @xmath67 the invariant matrix element @xmath68 can be decomposed as @xmath69 where @xmath70 are the dirac spinors for the initial and final nucleon respectively ; @xmath71 describes the current operator produced by the strongly interacting hadrons , and @xmath72 is the photon polarization vector .",
    "the spin dependence can be made explicit by decomposing the hadron current operator @xmath71 in terms of eight most general lorentz covariant pseudovectors ; @xmath73 because of the pseudoscalar nature of the @xmath7 meson , the only dirac matrices that enter in ( 15 ) are @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "taking into account the dirac equation for the incoming and outgoing nucleon , both on shell , @xmath77 and conservation of the four - momentum ( @xmath78 ) , one can form eight lorentz pseudovectors @xmath79 , where @xmath80 are @xmath81 where @xmath82 .",
    "any other pseudovector can be reduced to a linear combination of the @xmath83 .",
    "current conservation ( gauge invariance ) condition , @xmath84 , and the identity @xmath85 reduce the number of independent amplitudes to four for photoproduction@xcite , where @xmath86 is the electromagnetic hadron current .",

    "the isospin decomposition of the amplitudes is accomplished in the following way .",
    "the photon interaction has an isovector part and an isoscalar part , assuming that it has no isotensor part@xcite .",
    "the vector part leads to isovector amplitudes @xmath96 and the scalar part gives isoscalar amplitudes @xmath97 . since the @xmath7 meson is isoscalar , only isospin @xmath98 final states are allowed .",
    "thus , the isospin decomposition of the amplitudes has the simple form @xmath99 where the two physical amplitudes are given by @xmath100      it is convenient to reexpress the invariant amplitudes in terms of amplitudes corresponding to a definite parity and angular momentum state .",
    "the matrix elements appearing in eq.(19 ) are first written in a two - component form by expressing the @xmath101-matrices in terms of the pauli @xmath102-matrices , and the dirac spinors in terms of the two component spinors : @xmath103 where the @xmath104 are the initial and final nucleon pauli spinors and the factor @xmath105 has been introduced as a definition of the @xmath106 .",

    "it is well known that the amplitudes derived from the @xmath146 coupling are in accord with the low energy theorem ( @xmath147 ) based on gauge invariance and ( approximate ) chiral symmetry@xcite .",
    "however , because of the relatively large @xmath7 mass and big breaking of the chiral @xmath148 symmetry@xcite , compared to chiral @xmath149 one@xcite , there is no compelling reason to choose the @xmath146 form of the @xmath27 coupling . the feynman diagram for pv amplitudes",

    "are the preliminary mainz data on the total eta photoproduction cross - section , again with the absolute normalization being arbitrary . we compare them with our predictions from the effective lagrangian approach , with parameters determined from the old world supply of data , fit a. the _ shapes _ of both the angular distributions and total cross - section of the mainz data are predicted rather nicely ( figs . 8 and 9 respectively ) .",
    "the arbitrary factor needed to bring the data of the differential and total cross - section is the same .",
    "we are waiting with anticipation for the definitive normalizations of these data .",
    "we can get an idea of the importance of the preliminary mainz data on the physics of the @xmath46 resonances , particularly @xmath0 .",
    "the parameter @xmath381 , in units of @xmath406 , defined earlier , extracted only from the mainz data ( fit d ) is @xmath407 for the off - shell parameter @xmath408 , and @xmath409 for the off - shell parameter @xmath410 , for the vector meson form factor cut - off parameter @xmath411 .",
    "these compare with the value @xmath412 from our fit a of the world s old data set .",
    "thus , the error on the @xmath413 parameter is somewhat reduced , using the mainz data .",
    "taking @xmath414 , the preliminary mainz data yield a value of @xmath326 , in units of @xmath415 , @xmath416 for the above two cases , consistent with our results from the older data set , eq.(100 ) .",
    "it is substantially larger than the latest results from the quark model@xcite @xmath417 , and that from the analysis of pion photoproduction .",
    "the results ( eqs .",
    "101,102,104 ) are subject to revision , if the mainz data change substantially , as they are reanalyzed , but the basic conclusion of their importance in determining the @xmath413 parameter should remain valid . for comparison ,",
    "we quote here the values of @xmath413 and @xmath326 extracted from the bates data under similar theoretical assumptions in analysis : @xmath418      the threshold eta photoproduction and its impact on the determination of the @xmath27 coupling constant is the last topic we wish to address here .",
    "it is particularly interesting to contrast the @xmath419 amplitude for the @xmath7 photoproduction with that for the @xmath420 photoproduction at their respective thresholds .",
    "table [ table12 ] demonstrates the real part of the @xmath45 amplitude for the @xmath7 photoproduction off the proton at threshold , contrasted with the same for the @xmath6 photoproduction .",
    "while there is clear preference for the pv coupling at the @xmath421 vertex , this is not so for the @xmath7 meson , as we have pointed out earlier . here",
    ", we have given the @xmath419 amplitude as determined from the fits a , b , c and d , demonstrating the relevance of different data sets in the context of the @xmath419 amplitude .",
    "_ all fits agree in the dominant role of the @xmath0 resonance_.    interestingly , the value of the @xmath27 coupling constant extracted from the fits is only mildly sensitive to the choice of the @xmath146 or @xmath145 coupling at the meson - nucleon vertex . from fits to all data sets , using the resonance parameter set of @xmath330 , we get @xmath422 for the @xmath7 photoproduction , the vector meson contributions are sizable , but the @xmath0 excitation amplitude in the @xmath2-channel stands out , in contrast to the @xmath6 case , where both the vector meson and the @xmath29 contributions are minor . another important contribution to eta photoproduction",
    "is from the @xmath241 , with its off - shell effects tending to interfere destructively with the the large contribution of the @xmath145 born terms , or constructively with the smaller contribution of the @xmath146 born terms .",
    "given the renewed theoretical interest arising from the prospect of testing @xmath20 in the non - perturbative domain by computing hadron properties , and the experimental possibilities of exploring many of these properties in the novel electron / photon facilities now under development , particularly cebaf , eta photoproduction on the proton have been investigated in the @xmath0 resonance region , with a view to help understand the structure of the nucleon and its excited states . in this paper ,",
    "the goal has been to extract the product of the electric dipole transition amplitude @xmath423 and the decay amplitude @xmath424 , from the existing old experiments and new ones .",
    "the dominant tree - level contributions considered here have been computed in the framework of the effective lagrangian formalism , proven to be very successful in describing pion photoproduction in the @xmath425 region . unlike the @xmath6 case , there is no compelling reason to choose the pseudovector(@xmath146 ) form of the @xmath27 ( or @xmath426 ) coupling , and we have investigated both the pv and the pseudoscalar(ps ) couplings at the @xmath27 and the @xmath427 vertices . we have taken into account various background contributions , and have attampted to extract information on the excitation and decay of the @xmath0 resonance .",
    "our conclusions are as follows : + 1 .",
    "unlike the pion , where there is a clear preference for the @xmath146 coupling at the meson - nucleon vertex , seen in the threshold @xmath6 photoproduction data on the proton , the present experimental data on @xmath428 photoproduction do not distinguish between pseudovector and pseudoscalar couplings , as contributions from various resonances and non - resonant background compensate .",
    "this is not surprising , as the chiral symmetry is strongly broken by the eta mass .",
    "likewise , there is no strong preference for either coupling at the @xmath427 vertices .",
    "the extracted amplitude shows that the @xmath6 and the @xmath7 photoproduction processes near threshold have very significant differences , even as they share the common contributions , such as the nucleon born terms , the basis for the predictions of the low energy theorems ( let ) for the pion case . among these differences ,",
    "the contribution to the @xmath7 photoproduction by the @xmath2- channel excitation of the @xmath0 resonance is obvious .",
    "the situation is quite different in the @xmath6 case , where one probes only the nucleon born terms , and , through it , the chiral symmetry breaking effects , with minor contributions from the @xmath29 excitation .",
    "thus , the chiral symmetry breaking effects are hard to quantify in the @xmath7 case .",
    "many previous attempts at the analysis of @xmath7 photoproduction data have not only suffered from the crudeness of the data , but also from the lack of enough theoretical constraints in restricting the number of parameters fitted , _",
    "twenty four or more_. the effective lagrangian provides us with a _ tremendous reduction _ in the number of free parameters , _ eight in the present work_. the data base is immensely improved with the addition of the bates and mainz data sets , the latter still in their preliminary form .",
    "the @xmath45 amplitude at the eta photoproduction threshold , inferred from the new bates data , does not agree with those extracted from the older data set and the new mainz data .",
    "however , the conclusions on the @xmath0 excitation amplitude are similar in analyses of all of these data sets .",
    "our analysis yields a _ precise estimate _ of the product @xmath429 for the @xmath0 , which is quite insensitive to the uncertainties in the other resonance properties known thus far . for a given set of these resonance parameters ,",
    "it is _ not sensitive _ to the detail of the background , such as the off - shell parameters of @xmath241 , the form factor in the vector meson amplitude and the type of the meson - nucleon coupling .",
    "the present experimental situation on photoproduction at higher energies ( w@xmath430 1400 mev ) is not precise enough to extract any meaningful information about the contributions from resonances other than the @xmath0 . + we should stress that precise data on the polarization observables are missing and are badly needed .",
    "these would be valuable to test the models for the background contributions .    as to the future extension of this work",
    ", we must mention the prospect for a rigorous investigation of the unitarity effects .",
    "the application of unitarity to the eta photoproduction process is a very complicated task , because there are a fair number of channels coupled to the process and many of them contain more than two particles in the final state , as in the case of multipion production channels .",
    "therefore , even a modest unitarization of the amplitude should include at least five channels .",
    "there is no consistent partial wave analysis of the channel , @xmath431 , one of the most important ; also , no experimental information on the @xmath432 process is available .",
    "a successful understanding of strong interaction processes will help implement unitarity to electromagnetic processes .",
    "therefore , the pion - induced eta production , to be studied at facilities like cosy in jlich , germany , could help a great deal .",
    "these could be investigated using the lagrangians for the strong vertices considered here .",
    "valuable information on the strong decays of the type @xmath433 could be extracted .",
    "existing treatments of these processes give acceptable representation of the data , but do not make any precise connection with hadron models .",
    "an obvious extension of the present analysis is the photoproduction of @xmath434 meson on the nucleon , which is underway@xcite .",
    "a comparative study of @xmath7 and @xmath434 may lead to valuable information on how @xmath7 and @xmath434 interact with nucleons and its excited states .",
    "it is also interesting to use the @xmath7 photoproduction amplitude as an effective impulse operator to study photoproduction of eta mesons off nuclei .",
    "such a theoretical study has been initiated by doyle@xcite , and followed by others@xcite .",
    "one would like to learn more about the properties of the @xmath0 in the nuclear medium@xcite .",
    "one important task is to use the effective lagrangian , developed here , to investigate the photoproduction of the @xmath7 meson on the deuteron , where there seems to remain a serious discrepancy between the recent theoretical investigation@xcite and photoproduction experiments .",
    "_ this process is very crucial in extracting the electromagnetic transition amplitude of @xmath0 on the neutron , for which hadron models have clear - cut predictions_.    hopefully , this paper has provided a good motivation for future work involving physics of eta mesons and excited baryons .",
    "careful studies of electromagnetic as well as hadronic eta production processes are needed to obtain a more complete picture of the @xmath19 and @xmath7-nucleus interactions .",
    "new facilities , such as cebaf and cosy , would be good places to explore this subject further .",
    "particular mention should be made of the superior design capabilities of a device called the cebaf large acceptance spectrometer ( clas ) : its almost @xmath435 solid angle coverage and the possible use of polarized targets and beams in conjunction with it .",
    "our work lays the basic foundation for theoretical analysis which would be indispensible for the studies for photo- and electroproduction of eta mesons@xcite with such spectrometers .",
    "we are particularly grateful to r. m. davidson and l. zhang for many helpful discussions .",
    "we thank many experimental colleagues around the world for their strong interests and inputs , especially , s. dytman , b. gothe , b. krusche , b. ritchie , b. schoch , p. stoler and h. stroeher .",

    "<S> the observed differential cross - section is not very sensitive to either the nature of the eta - nucleon coupling or to the precise value of the coupling constant ; we extract a broad range of values for the @xmath7nn pseudoscalar coupling constant : @xmath15 from our analysis of all available data . </S>",
    "<S> we predict , in our ela , the angular distributions for a critical series of experiments at mainz , and find them to be in good agreement with the preliminary mainz data . finally , we discuss implications for future experimental studies with real photons at the continuous electron beam accelerator facility ( cebaf ) and other emerging medium - energy electron accelerators . </S>",
    "<S> polarization observables , in particular , invite special scrutiny at high precision . </S>"
