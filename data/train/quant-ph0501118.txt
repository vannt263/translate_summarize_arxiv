    "it should , however , be noted that the two - level spectrum would clearly dominate the experimental outcome , as the intensity of the three - level spectrum is very low due to the trapping of the population in the @xmath2 state .",

    "the modification of the lamb shift in a dressed environment ( i.e. , a strong laser field ) is complementary to other `` dressed '' situations like a cavity .",
    "indeed , the lamb shift in a cavity has received considerable attention in the past two decades , both theoretically as well as experimentally  @xcite .",
    "also , one should take the occasion to mention that laser - dressed states have been used in many experiments on the mollow - related phenomena , especially dressed states involving rydberg levels .",
    "one of the ` classic ' experimental setups in the field involves a maser tuned near resonance to a transition between two rydberg states , which provides a strong driving field , as well as a microwave cavity whose eigenmode is also close to the resonance .",
    "there are three frequencies relevant to the problem : ( i ) the frequency of the driving field , ( ii ) the atomic resonance frequency ( corresponding to the transition between rydberg states ) , and ( iii ) the eigenmode of the cavity .",
    "it is well known that spontaneous emission can be enhanced if the cavity eigenmode frequency is equal to a mollow sideband  @xcite .",
    "the modifications of the cavity - induced spontaneous emission are well described by the optical master equation  @xcite , and good agreement between theory and experiment is obtained  @xcite .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors describe an experiment in which a two - photon transition between dressed states is observed in a driven microwave cavity .",
    "the atomic beam consists of @xmath126 atoms excited to the @xmath127 state , and a maser is tuned near , but not on resonance to the transition to the @xmath128 state . when the detuning @xmath69 is adjusted so that @xmath129 , the otherwise dominant one - photon decay is suppressed , and the atom decays via emission of two photons into the cavity mode , under simultaneous absorption of a photon from the laser mode .",
    "the third photon is necessary in order to ensure angular momentum conservation in the electric dipole transition .",
    "consequently , a further natural ground for an extension of the ideas outlined here would be to consider the laser - dressed lamb shift in the additionally modified environment of a cavity .    in general",
    ", our approach is concerned with atomic physics ; yet the analysis requires the techniques of quantum field theory .",
    "approximate answers can be obtained for realistic situations by simply applying the results of the asymptotic - state formalism  @xcite to the quantities that are of relevance to the dynamical process . however , as demonstrated here and in  @xcite , there exist some small residual dynamic effects which can only be understood if one uses a picture in which the dynamics is treated in full .",
    "an experimental investigation of the laser - dressed lamb shift , which depends on the laser intensity and the detuning , would require an accurate measurement of a ( stabilized ) laser intensity , which is problematic ; other experimental issues include the doppler effect , which must be controlled by using a well - collimated atomic beam  @xcite .",
    "yet , the intriguing consequences of the theoretical predictions may warrant this effort .",
    "recent progress in heterodyne measurements of the resonance fluorescence of single ions  @xcite may indicate that ultimately , achieving high accuracy in the measurement of the fluorescence spectra will rather depend on technical questions than on fundamental theoretical limitations .    financial support",
