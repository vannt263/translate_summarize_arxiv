    "one of the most important problem in quantum information theory is to determine the quantum capacity of a noisy quantum channel .",
    "the capacity is defined as the transmission rate optimized over all possible quantum error correcting codes such that decoding errors vanish in the limit of asymptotically many uses of the channel .",
    "mathematically , a quantum channel can be described by the trace preserving completely positive ( tpcp ) map from the input system to the output system . by using the stinespring dilation of the tpcp map",
    ", we can naturally define a complementary channel to an environment system , and we can regard the noisy quantum channel as a wire - tap channel @xcite from the sender to the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper who can observe the environment system of the channel ( eg .  see @xcite ) .",
    "then we can define the private capacity of the noisy quantum channel as the transmission rate optimized over all possible wire - tap codes such that decoding errors and information leakage vanish in the limit of asymptotically many uses of the channel .",
    "the private capacity and quantum capacity of noisy quantum channels were established in @xcite .",
    "however unlike the capacity formula of a classical noisy channel or the private capacity formula of a classical wire - tap channel , the private capacity and quantum capacity formulae are not single letter characterized , i.e. , the formulae involve the limit with respect to the number of channel uses , and they are not computable .",
    "indeed , some numerical evidences clarified that the expressions in the capacity formulae are not additive @xcite , and the single letter characterization is not possible in general at least by using the same expressions .",
    "a quantum channel is called degradable if there exists another degrading channel such that the conjunction of the channel to the legitimate receiver and the degrading channel coincide with the complementary channel to the eavesdropper . in such a case ,",
    "the single letter characterizations of the private capacity and quantum capacity were established @xcite .",
    "a quantum channel is called conjugate degradable if there exists another degrading channel such that the conjunction of the channel to the legitimate receiver and the degrading channel coincide with the complementary channel to the eavesdropper up to complex conjugation . in such a case ,",
    "the single letter characterizations were also established @xcite .",
    "to date , all quantum channel whose capacities are single letter characterized are degradable or conjugate degradable , and it is important to clarify a broader class of quantum channels such that the single letter characterizations are possible .    aside from the possibility of the single letter characterizations ,",
    "there is also another interesting problem . in the quantum information theory ,",
    "the private information transmission and the quantum information transmission are closely related @xcite , and the possibility of the latter implies the possibility of the former",
    ". however , the private information transmission and the quantum information transmission are not exactly equivalent . indeed ,",
    "although the private capacity and quantum capacity coincide for degradable quantum channels @xcite , the former can be strictly larger than the latter in general .",
    "especially the private capacity can be positive even if the quantum capacity is zero @xcite .",
    "thus it is important to clarify a condition on quantum channels such that the private capacity and quantum capacity coincide or not .    to shed light on the above mentioned two problems , we introduce two new classes of quantum channels , which we call _ more capable _ and _ less noisy_. the more capable class consists of channels such that the quantum capacities of the complementary channels are zero .",
    "the less noisy class consists of channels such that the private capacities of the complementary channels are zero .",
    "later , these definitions turn out to be natural analogies of the partial orderings , more capable and less noisy , between classical channels @xcite",
    ".    the inclusive relation of the degradable , the conjugate degradable , the less noisy , and the more capable classes are summarized in fig .  [ fig : quantum - channel ] . in this paper , we show that the private capacity and quantum capacity coincide for channels in the more capable class . furthermore",
    ", we also show that the private capacity and quantum capacity can be single letter characterized for channels in the less noisy class .",
    "these results provide partial solutions to the above mentioned two problems .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ section : preliminaries ] , we review some known results on the private capacity and quantum capacity of quantum channels . in section [ section : main ] , the more capable and less noisy classes are introduced , and we state our main results . in section [ section : proof ] , we summarize certain properties implied by more capable and less noisy , and show proofs of our main results .",
    "we finalize the paper with conclusion in section [ section : proof ] .",
    "let @xmath0 be a quantum channel from an input system @xmath1 to an output system @xmath2 . by using the stinespring dilation ( eg .  see @xcite ) , there exist an environment system @xmath3 and an isometry @xmath4 from @xmath1 to the joint system @xmath5 such that @xmath6\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for every input @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the partial trace with respect to the environment system . by using this representation",
    ", we can naturally define another channel @xmath9,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is usually called the complementary channel of @xmath0 .",
    "although the stinespring dilation is not unique , the following arguments do not depend on the choice of the dilation because two dilations can be converted to each other by applying a local unitary to the environment systems .    throughout the paper ,",
    "we basically follow the notations from @xcite .",
    "the von neumann entropy of a density matrix @xmath7 is defined by @xmath10 , and the quantum relative entropy between @xmath7 and @xmath11 is defined by @xmath12 . for input state @xmath13 to the channel @xmath0 , the coherent information is defined by @xmath14 .",
    "when the input state is clear from the context , we omit the subscript and denote @xmath15 .",
    "the quantum mutual information of @xmath16 on the joint system is defined by @xmath17 .",
    "especially , when @xmath16 is classical with respect to @xmath18 , i.e. , @xmath16 is of the form @xmath19 then the quantum mutual information can be written as @xmath20    when the legitimate receiver can observe the output of @xmath0 and the eavesdropper can observe the output of @xmath21 , the private capacity is characterized by @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 are states ( not necessarily pure states ) on @xmath1 indexed by @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is a probability distribution on a finite set @xmath27 .    on the other hand , when the sender want to transmit quantum information to the receiver through the channel @xmath0 , the quantum capacity is characterized by @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29    both eqs .",

    "furthermore , the private capacity can be strictly larger than the quantum capacity , i.e. , @xmath32 for some channels @xcite .",
    "the channel @xmath0 is said to be degradable if there exists a tpcp map @xmath33 such that @xmath34 .",

    "( [ eq : q - more - capable ] ) or ( [ eq : q - less - noisy ] ) more capable or less noisy .    in @xcite , alternative description of less noisy , less divergence contracting , was introduced , and we can also extend such a description to the quantum channel .",

    "later , we will show that the quantum channel is less noisy if and only if less divergence contracting ( proposition [ proposition : q - equivalence - less - noisy - divergence ] ) .",

    "conjugate degradable implies less noisy .    when the quantum capacity of the channel is @xmath62 but it can be used to share bound entanglement , then the channel is called a binding entanlement channel @xcite .",
    "especially when the channel produces a positive partial transpose ( ppt ) bound entanglement , the channel is called ppt binding entanglement channel . if a complementary channel is a binding entanglement channel , then the main channel obviously belongs to the more capable class .",
    "since the complementary channel of the conjugate degradable channel can only produce ppt bipartite state @xcite , if there exists a conjectured negative partial transpose ( npt ) binding entanglement channel , the complementary of such a channel belongs to the more capable class but not to the conjugate degradable class .",
    "it is known that there exists a channel such that the quantum capacity is zero ( ppt binding entanglement channel ) but the private capacity is strictly positive @xcite . let the complementary channel @xmath21 be such a channel . then the channel @xmath0 is more capable but not less noisy , then the complementary channel @xmath21 is more capable . then , theorem [ theorem : more - capable ] implies that @xmath63 , which contradict with the fact @xmath64 . ] .",
