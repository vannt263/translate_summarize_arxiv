    "entanglement plays an important role in quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum dense coding @xcite , quantum key distribution @xcite , and some other protocols @xcite all require the entanglement to set up the maximally entanglement channel . on the other hand , to complete the quantum computation , they should also create the entanglement @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , during the distribution and storage of the entanglement , it always suffers from the environment noise . the environment noise will make the entanglement degrade .",
    "the degraded entanglement will make the quantum communication insecure .",
    "it will also make the quantum computation cause error .    generally , the maximally entangled state will degrade to a mixed state . in an optical system , the maximally",
    "entangled state such as the bell state @xmath0 will become the mixed state as @xmath1 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath3 is the horizonal polarization of the photon and @xmath4 is the vertical polarization    of the photon . on the other hand , the maximally entangled state @xmath5",
    "also can degrade to a pure less - entangled state @xmath6 @xcite . here",
    "distilling the high fidelity of the mixed states from the low quality of the mixed states is the entanglement purification @xcite .",
    "there are a lot of excellent works focused on the entanglement purification , such as the entanglement purification protocols based on the controlled - not gate @xcite , linear optics@xcite , nonlinear optics @xcite , and so on @xcite .",
    "the approach of distilling the pure maximally entangled states from the less - entangled states is entanglement concentration .",
    "there are also many excellent works for entanglement concentration , such as the entanglement concentration based on the collective measurement @xcite , unitary operation @xcite , linear optics @xcite and so on @xcite .",
    "actually , the decoherence models described above are both existed in a practical entanglement distribution .",
    "unfortunately , in the previous works , people deal with these problem independently .",
    "they either focused on the entanglement purification nor entanglement concentration .",
    "therefore , they can only partially solve the problem of decoherence . in this paper",
    ", we will describe a general distillation mode for decoherence .",
    "suppose that the pure maximally entangled state @xmath5 will both degrade to the mixed state and the less - entangled state , and the decoherence model can be described as @xmath8    here we denote @xmath9 ) , it is shown that the initial state @xmath5 becomes a mixed state @xmath10 , while in each part of the mixed state , it is still a less - entangled state , say @xmath11 or @xmath12 .",
    "therefor , in order to distill such mixed state @xmath10 , we not only need to improve the fidelity of the mixed state @xmath13 , but also concentrate the less - entangled state @xmath11 and @xmath12 to the maximally entangled state . in this paper",
    ", we will describe the approach that we can distill such mixed state effectively .",
    "after performing the protocol , we can obtain the high fidelity mixed state with each components being the maximally entangled state .",
    "that is , our protocol can both realize the entanglement purification and entanglement concentration in one step .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we will explain our protocol with the correcting of the bit - flip error . in sec .",
    "iii , we will describe the distillation of the phase - flip error .",
    "interestingly , both steps can be repeated to obtain a high success probability . in sec.iv",
    ", we will extend our protocol to the case of multi - partite entangled systems . in sec .",
    "v , we will make a discussion and conclusion .",
    "before we start to explain our protocol . it is necessary to introduce the cross - kerr nonlinearity , which is the key element in our protocol . from fig .",
    "1 , the hamiltonian of the cross - kerr nonlinearity can be written as @xcite @xmath14 if we consider a single photon with @xmath3 polarization in @xmath15 spatial mode .",
    "this photon combined with the coherent state @xmath16 will evolve to @xmath17 . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath4 polarization in @xmath15 spatial mode combined with the coherent state @xmath18 will evolve to @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , by measuring the phase shift of the coherent state , we can judge the single photon number . in this way",
    ", we do not need to detect the single photon directly .",
    "it is so called the quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) measurement , which has been widely used in quantum information processing @xcite .    from fig .",
    "2 , suppose that alice and bob share two pairs of the mixed states in the spatial modes @xmath15 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "the mixed state @xmath10 can be described in eq .",
    "( [ general0 ] ) . before the two pairs passing through the qnd",
    ", they first perform a bit - flip operation on the second pair in @xmath21 and @xmath22 modes .",
    "the state @xmath11 will become latexmath:[\\ ] ]",
    "in this section , we will describe the distillation of the phase - flip error . in the previous entanglement purification protocols ,",
    "the phase - flip error can be conversed to the bit - flip error by hadamard operation and can be purified in the next round .",
    "however , in this protocol , we can not treat it like the previous entanglement purification protocols .",
    "suppose that alice and bob share the mixed state of the form @xmath85 here @xmath86 is in the @xmath15 and @xmath20 spatial modes and @xmath87 is in the @xmath21 spatial mode .",
    "alice first let his two photons pass through the qnd .",
    "the state @xmath88 and @xmath89 combined with the coherent state can be described as @xmath90    obviously , if the coherent state picks up no phase shift , they will obtain the state @xmath5 after measuring the photon in @xmath91 spatial modes in @xmath63 basis , with the probability of @xmath92 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the initial state is @xmath93 , they will obtain @xmath55 with the probability of @xmath94 . in this way",
    ", the mixed state @xmath95 becomes a new mixed state @xmath96 the success probability is @xmath97 .",
    "certainly , they can also repeat the protocol to increase the success probability , if the coherent state picks up the phase shift @xmath57 . in the second round",
    ", alice only needs to prepare another single photon of the form of @xmath98 as shown in eq .",
    "( [ single1 ] ) .",
    "following the same principle , if the coherent state picks up no phase shift , they will obtain @xmath99 with the success probability of @xmath100 .",
    "if they repeat it for @xmath78 round , the success probability is @xmath101 if they obtain the state @xmath99 , it is the standard mixed state with a phase - flip error like ref .",
    "@xcite . in this way",
    ", they both perform the hadamard operation to converse the phase - flip error to a bit - flip error . after performing the hadamard operations on two photons , the state of @xmath5 does not change , while @xmath55 becomes @xmath5 .",
    "the form of the transformed mixed state is the same as the mixed state shown in eq .",
    "( [ newmixed ] ) .",
    "therefore , it can be distilled in a next round .",
    "in this section , we will describe the distillation of the multipartite greenberg - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state .",
    "an @xmath78-particle ghz state can be described as @xmath102 suppose that the mixed state can be written as @xmath103     represents the @xmath78-particle ghz state.,width=302 ]    here @xmath104 and @xmath105 the principle of distillation the multipartite ghz state is similar to the previous description .",
    "the @xmath78 photons are distributed to alice , bob , charlie , etc . in each round , they choose two pairs of mixed state @xmath106 .",
    "the first pair is in the spatial modes @xmath15 , @xmath20 , @xmath107 , and so on .",
    "the second pair is in the @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath108 , and so on .",
    "they first let the state @xmath109 perform bit - flip operation on each photon and make the whole state become @xmath110 the state @xmath111 becomes @xmath112 the new mixed state can be written as @xmath113    as shown in fig .",
    "3 , they choose two copies of mixed states in each round .",
    "the whole system can also be regarded as the mixture of four states . with the probability of @xmath114 , it is in the state @xmath115 . with the same probability of @xmath26 , they are in the states @xmath116 and @xmath117 . with the probability of @xmath29 ,",
    "it is in the state @xmath118 .",
    "the principle of the distillation is similar to the previous one .",
    "after the photons passing through the qnds , they pick up the case that all the coherent states have no phase shift . in this way",
    ", the cross - combination items can be eliminated automatically .",
    "the remained states are @xmath102 with the probability of @xmath38 , and the state @xmath119 with the probability of @xmath40 . finally , by measuring the even number of the photons in the basis @xmath63",
    ", they will ultimately obtain the new mixed state @xmath120 here @xmath121     is altered with the initial coefficient @xmath122 . here",
    "we let @xmath123 .",
    "@xmath78 is the iteration number.,width=264 ]    on the other hand , if they pick up the same phase shift @xmath57 , and measuring the even number photons in the @xmath63 basis , they will obtain @xmath124 and @xmath125 similarly , they only need to prepare the single photon state of the form as show in eq .",
    "( [ single1 ] ) , and following the same operation shown in the previous section , they will obtain the same mixed state @xmath126 with the probability of @xmath72 $ ] . in this way , it can also be repeated to obtain a high success probability .",
    "once the bit - flip error can be corrected , the phase flip error can also be corrected in a next round .",
    "so far , we have fully described our protocol . we first explained the protocol with a bit - flip error . by selecting the cases that both coherent states picking up no phase shift",
    ", they can obtain the higher fidelity of the mixed state . on the other hand ,",
    "if both the coherent states pick up the phase shift with @xmath57 , this protocol can be repeated to reach a high success probability . in our protocol",
    ", we also show that the phase - flip error can also be well distilled .",
    "different from the bit - flip error correction , it can be achieved in two steps . in the first step ,",
    "they first prepare a single photon . after the single photon and the mixed state both pass through the qnd in alice s location , they select the case that the coherent state pick up no phase shift . in this way",
    ", the original mixed state becomes a standard mixed state in eq .",
    "( [ general3 ] ) .",
    "subsequently , they perform the hadamard operation on both photons to convert the phase - flip error to the bit - flip error , which can be distilled in a conventional way .",
    "interestingly , in the first step , if the coherent state pick up the phase shift @xmath57 , it can also be repeated to obtain a high success probability .",
    "it is interesting to compare this protocol with previous entanglement purification protocols and concentration protocols . in the pioneer work of purification @xcite",
    ", they achieved the bit - flip error correction with the post - selection principle .",
    "@xcite also described the entanglement concentration protocol . in their protocol , they can obtain the maximally entangled state with the success probability of @xmath127 . in our protocol , if we let @xmath128 , our model is simplified to the standard entanglement concentration . on the other hand ,",
    "if we let @xmath129 , this protocol is essentially the entanglement purification model .",
    "therefore , our distillation protocol is more practical and universal than both purification and concentration protocols . actually , if the pure maximally entangled state degrades to the mixed state shown in eq .",
    "( [ general0 ] ) , one can also perform the entanglement concentration first to obtain the standard mixed state in eq .",
    "( [ general3 ] ) and perform the entanglement purification subsequently . in our protocol , one of the advantage is that it can be completed in one step .",
    "moreover , this protocol can be repeated to obtain a high success probability . in fig .",
    "4 , we calculated the success probability altered with the initial coefficient @xmath122 in the distillation of the bit - flip error .",
    "we also let @xmath123 . from fig .",
    "4 , it is shown that the success probability increases greatly if we repeat this protocol .",
    "the max success probability is only 0.34 with @xmath130 , while it can reach 0.66 with @xmath131 .    in our protocol",
    ", the cross - kerr nonlinearity plays an important role in distillation .",
    "the success case is that the coherent state picks up no phase shift .",
    "it is essentially to make a parity check .",
    "they can distinguish the even parity state @xmath32 and @xmath33 from the odd parity state @xmath34 and @xmath35 , according to the different phase shifts of the coherent states . in a practical experiment",
    ", we should require the phase shift of the cross - kerr nonlinearity to reach a visible value .",
    "that is to require the @xmath132 .",
    "one method is to increase the amplitude of the coherent state .",
    "the other method is to amplify the normal cross - kerr nonlinearity .",
    "recently theoretical work showed that the giant kerr nonlinearity can be obtain in a multiple quantum - well structure with a four - level , double @xmath133-type configuration @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the weak measurement can also be used to amplify the cross - kerr nonlinearity @xcite . moreover",
    ", current experiment reported that the `` giant '' cross - kerr effect with phase shift of 20 degrees per photon has been observed @xcite .    in conclusion",
    ", we presented a practical entanglement distillation protocol for general mixed state model . in the general mixed state model ,",
    "each components are still the less - entangled states .",
    "therefore , our protocol can not only improve the fidelity of the mixed state , but also can concentrate the less - entangled state to the maximally entangled state .",
    "for the bit - flip correction , the distinct advantage is that such process can be completed in one step .",
    "moreover , this protocol can reach a high success probability by repeating this protocol , resorting to the qnd measurement .",
