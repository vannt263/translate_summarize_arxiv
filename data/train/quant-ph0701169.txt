    "it is quite clear that the main interest to the quantum computing has been generated by shor s factorization algorithm @xcite which has exponential efficiency gain compared to any known classical algorithm .",
    "indeed , shor s algorithm allows to find the factors of a large number @xmath3 with @xmath4 quantum gates while all known classical algorithms require a number of operations that grows exponentially with @xmath5 ( see e.g. review and relevant refs . in @xcite ) . without any doubt",
    "this result has a fundamental importance from a mathematical view point .",
    "however , its implementation in real life requires an understanding of effects of imperfections and errors unavoidably present in any real physical realization of the algorithm on a realistic quantum computer . again , here a mathematician can be satisfied by a mathematical statement that in quantum computations the errors grow not faster than quadratically with the number of performed quantum gates ( see @xcite ) and thus the global accuracy of the algorithm is good enough if the norm of errors in each quantum gate is sufficiently small .",
    "however , a physicist generally would like to see more concrete and realistic estimates of the algorithm accuracy .",
    "unfortunately , direct experimental verification of the accuracy for a large number of gates and qubits is not possible at present .",
    "indeed , the most advanced quantum computation of shor s algorithm has been done on a 7-qubit nmr - based quantum computer that allowed to factorize only a rather small number @xmath6 ( even if certain simplifications of the original algorithm have been used ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , the only possibility remaining is the method of numerical simulations testing various types of realistic errors and imperfections .",
    "the first steps in this direction have been done in @xcite . a number of interesting effects of errors on the accuracy of shor s algorithm has been found in these pioneering works but the factorized number was still @xmath6 and therefore it was not possible to determine the accuracy scaling at large values of @xmath3 .",
    "more recently , additional numerical studies have been performed to investigate the effects of finite accuracy in quantum phase rotations of the quantum fourier transform ( qft ) algorithm used in shor s factorization @xcite , dynamical phase errors in shor s algorithm with @xmath3 up to 33 @xcite and discrete qubit flip errors @xcite with @xmath3 up to 247 . in the latter case the qft part of shor",
    "s algorithm has been performed in a semiclassical way using the one qubit control trick ( see e.g. @xcite ) while the modular multiplication has been been performed with up to 20 qubits including the workspace using the circuit described in @xcite . in this work",
    "we perform extensive numerical simulations investigating effects of imperfections on the accuracy of shor s algorithm factorizing numbers up to a maximal value @xmath0 using up to @xmath7 qubits .",
    "we concentrate our studies on the case of static imperfections which induce static one - qubit energy shifts and residual static couplings between qubits following the lines started in @xcite .",
    "this type of imperfections is especially important since generally the errors produced in this case are accumulated coherently and lead to a more rapid drop of fidelity and accuracy of quantum computations compared to the cases of noisy unitary errors in quantum gates @xcite and dissipative decoherence @xcite .",
    "it is known that for the quantum algorithms simulating problems of quantum chaos periodic in time the floquet eigenstates are exponentially sensitive to static imperfections @xcite . due to",
    "that the study of their effects on the accuracy of shor s algorithm becomes especially relevant since recently it has been shown that certain blocks of the shor algorithm are characterized by the properties of quantum chaos @xcite .",
    "also it is important to note that shor s algorithm is essentially based on a determination of a certain frequency of return . in some cases , like in the grover algorithm , such a frequency",
    "can be exponentially sensitive to static couplings @xcite that makes the investigation of static imperfections effects in shor s algorithm even more important .",
    "thus , in the present work we present the first numerical studies of how the static imperfections affect the accuracy of shor s algorithm .",
    "our aim is to determine the parametric dependence of the accuracy on the imperfection strength , number of qubits and number of gates . for this",
    "we use a simplified but generic model of imperfections which can be applied to various implementations of shor s algorithm discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "the paper has the following structure : section ii gives a brief description of ideal shor s algorithm , section iii describes the model of errors introduced by static imperfections , the results of numerical studies are presented in section iv and the discussion of the results is given in section v.",
    "first we briefly describe the main structure of shor s algorithm @xcite factorizing a large integer number @xmath3 using parallelism of many - body quantum evolution .",
    "following shor we choose a random number @xmath8 relatively prime to @xmath3 and calculate its _ order _ @xmath9 ( also called _ period _ ) defined as the minimal positive integer value such that @xmath10 once @xmath9 is known there is a high probability to obtain two non - trivial factors of @xmath3 by a classical computation in polynomial time ( in the number of binary digits of @xmath3 ) .",
    "this procedure fails in rare cases @xcite and in such a case one has simply to chose a different value of @xmath8 and restart again .",
    "the difficult task is to compute the order @xmath9 and this task can be efficiently achieved by shor s algorithm provided we have a reliable quantum computer with a sufficient number of qubits at our disposal .",
    "this algorithm requires an @xmath11-qubit state composed of two quantum registers which we will call the _ control register _ ( with @xmath12 qubits ) and the _ computational register _",
    "( with @xmath13 qubits ) .",
    "we associate to the basis states of both registers integer numbers by : @xmath14 where in binary representation @xmath15 and @xmath16 for the control register or @xmath17 for the computational register . here",
    "@xmath18 represents the @xmath19th qubit of the register and @xmath20 . in order to factorize",
    "a number @xmath3 one needs to choose @xmath12 and @xmath21 such that @xmath22 and @xmath23 , therefore typically @xmath24 .",
    "we first prepare the initial state @xmath25 and then apply single qubit hadamard gates to every qubit in the control register and get ( dropping subscripts ) @xmath26 the principal idea of shor s algorithm is the observation that one can construct a combination of quantum gates , acting on both registers , that performs for all @xmath27 simultaneously the operation  : @xmath28 which gives the state @xmath29 then , after obtaining the state @xmath30 , we apply the qft @xcite to the control register @xmath31 and measure both arguments to get @xmath32 where @xmath33 is arbitrary and the sum over @xmath34 runs over all values such that @xmath35",
    ". therefore @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 + 1 $ ] and the evaluation of the sum yields : @xmath39 this function only depends weakly on the choice of @xmath40 ( since @xmath41 and @xmath42 such that @xmath43 and @xmath44 is nearly constant in @xmath40 ) and as a function of @xmath45 it has @xmath9 equidistant strongly localized peaks of width unity , of height @xmath46 and located at @xmath47 with @xmath48 .",
    "if the algorithm is run by an _",
    "ideal _ quantum computer , then with a very high probability the outcome of a measurement will be given by an integer value of @xmath45 which is very close to one of the peaks @xmath49 .",
    "thus , using a continuous fraction expansion we can determine the rational number @xmath50 closest to @xmath51 with a denominator smaller than @xmath3 . here",
    "the choice @xmath41 ensures that there is at most one such number inside the peak and therefore @xmath50 coincides with @xmath52 .",
    "furthermore the position number @xmath53 of the peak is quite random and if by chance @xmath53 is relatively prime to @xmath9 one obtains directly @xmath54 and the algorithm succeeds .",
    "however , if @xmath53 and @xmath9 have a common divisor larger than unity we have @xmath55 and the algorithm did not succeed .",
    "therefore one has to check classically if the candidate `` @xmath56 '' for @xmath9 is indeed a solution of @xmath57 .",
    "this fortunately can be done in a polynomial time . in case of failure",
    "the algorithm has to be repeated and even though the probability of success is not very high one obtains after a few ( @xmath58 ) measurements @xcite the correct value @xmath59 .",
    "practically it is more convenient to measure only the control register which provides @xmath45 with the total probability : @xmath60 we note that the dependence of @xmath61 on @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : probresult ] ) is rather weak and therefore the above procedure to determine the minimal period @xmath9 remains the same .",
    "however , this description of the algorithm still lacks some precision how to implement the operation described in equation ( [ eq : operation ] ) .",
    "suppose we are able to perform on the computational register the multiplication by @xmath62 : @xmath63 by some unitary operator . of course this operator can not be unitary if we require this for all values @xmath64 simply because the classical application @xmath65 is not unique on this set ( unless @xmath66 which is of no interest ) .",
    "if we require that @xmath8 and @xmath3 are relatively prime then this application is unique at least for @xmath67 and for @xmath68 we have to complete it in some unique way , for example by : @xmath69 if @xmath70 .",
    "therefore we define the quantum multiplication operator by @xmath71 by : @xmath72 the states @xmath73 with @xmath70 are in principle not relevant for the _ ideal _ shor algorithm because they are never populated in the perfect computation and the effect of the quantum gates on these states is rarely discussed in the literature @xcite . however , they are important to ensure overall unitarity and they may be very well populated if the quantum computation is subjected to errors or imperfections .",
    "furthermore , we note that in the definition ( [ eq : quantmultdef ] ) we could in principle replace the unit - operator acting on the non - relevant states by an arbitrary unitary operator ( acting on a space of dimension @xmath74 ) provided that we do not mix relevant ( @xmath75 ) and non - relevant states ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "we now introduce the controlled multiplication operator @xmath76 acting on both registers ( control and computational register ) applying the simple multiplication ( [ eq : quantmultdef ] ) on the computational register if and only if the @xmath77th qubit of the control register is @xmath78 . developing @xmath79 with @xmath80 we see that the operation ( [ eq : operation ] ) can be performed by the unitary operator : @xmath81 since @xmath82 and where in the last equation every multiplication is taken modulo @xmath3 .",

    "has to show that this operator can be realized in terms of elementary one or two qubit quantum - gates .",
    "we do not enter into details here and mention as examples the important works @xcite that provided explicit implementations of the quantum multiplication by @xmath62 using @xmath83 elementary gates .",
    "these implementations require also additional work space qubits which are initially @xmath84 and must remain so after completion of this operator , i.e. the implementations must eventually provide code to reversibly `` erase '' the additional work space qubits .",
    "we assume that there are no errors inside this additional work space and no errors coupling it to the control and computational registers . in this way",
    "we may restrict our consideration only to @xmath85 qubits .",
    "we now turn to shor s algorithm in the case of static imperfections @xcite generated by residual couplings between qubits and energy level shifts .",
    "the effects of these imperfections and their numerical modeling have been considered in detail in @xcite on examples of quantum chaos algorithms ( see also refs . in @xcite on other works ) . there",
    "it has been shown that effects of static residual couplings can be modeled by an additional unitary rotation acting between two arbitrary gates  : @xmath86 . here",
    "@xmath87 represents the hamiltonian due to the residual static couplings between qubits which provides a non - trivial evolution of the state stored in the quantum register even in absence of any quantum gate . in this approach",
    "the quantum gates are considered to be exactly ideal . in principle @xmath87",
    "may couple all qubits in the control register , in the computational register and in the additional work space necessary for the concrete implementations of the quantum multiplication operator ( [ eq : quantmultdef ] ) .",
    "however , in this work we use a simplified error model in which @xmath87 couples only the qubits in the computational register and therefore in shor s algorithm the initial hadamard gates or the final quantum fourier transform are not affected by these errors . in principle the quantum fourier transform is considered as relatively stable with respect to errors @xcite and the number of hadamard gates @xmath12 is relatively small .",
    "furthermore we do not consider a specific implementation of the quantum multiplication operator ( [ eq : quantmultdef ] ) , we only assume that it can be written as a product @xmath88 where @xmath89 , @xmath90 are the elementary quantum gates which constitute this operator and @xmath91 is the number of these elementary gates . a specific choice of @xmath89 depends on the classical variable @xmath8 , and also on @xmath3 , and since the value of @xmath8 significantly affects the algorithm implementation we have a different set of gates @xmath89 for each @xmath8 ( and @xmath3 ) .    thus , in presence of static imperfections the quantum multiplication operator @xmath92 has the form : @xmath93 we now introduce an effective perturbation operator for the full multiplication operator by : @xmath94 from eq .",
    "( [ multproduct_static ] ) we may determine @xmath95 as : @xmath96 with @xmath97 we mention that the precise relation between @xmath95 and @xmath87 is not really important in our approach since we directly model @xmath95 in our numerical simulations and use the expression ( [ heffdef ] ) without entering into details of a particular implementation of @xmath98 .",
    "we remind that in ( [ heffcalc ] ) , ( [ hjdeff ] ) the dependence of @xmath95 on @xmath8 is given by the choice of elementary gates @xmath89 which are changed with a change of @xmath8 . a schematic quantum circuit of shor s algorithm on a quantum computer with static imperfections in the quantum multiplication operator ( [ eq : quantmultdef ] ) is shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] .    =    as we already mentioned , the implementations of the quantum multiplication operator ( [ eq : quantmultdef ] ) described in refs .",

    "@xcite contains a quantum code that erases the work space qubits correctly but only for the relevant states @xmath73 with @xmath99 as initial states and not for the non - relevant states with @xmath70 . for a perfect quantum computer",
    "this is of course not a problem , but when taking into account errors the non - relevant states may be populated and different implementations , which are absolutely equivalent for the relevant states , may potentially behave quite differently with errors . even if the particular implementation ensures that a non - relevant state as initial state produces a properly erased work space register , the errors may still produce non - erased contributions .",
    "actually the use of work space qubits implies that the notion of non - relevant states has to be enlarged , i.e. a combined state @xmath100 in the computational and work space register has to be considered as _ non - relevant _ if either @xmath70 for @xmath101 or @xmath102 arbitrary for @xmath103 .",
    "if shor s algorithm is implemented on a perfect quantum computer without any imperfections these non - relevant states are never populated .",
    "however , errors and imperfections will populate these states and their role is potentially quite important in this context . in this work",
    "we do not want to enter into the details of the effects due to the work space qubits .",
    "so , we simply assume that our model of imperfection effects ( [ multproduct_static ] ) acts only in the computational register , or in other words the static imperfections do not couple computational qubits with work space qubits . however , even in this approximation we still keep track of the non - relevant states in the computational register ( the states @xmath73 with @xmath70 ) .    for numerical simulations of shor",

    "( [ heffcalc ] ) , ( [ hjdeff ] ) strongly depends on the actual value of @xmath8 because this factor is hardcoded in realistic implementations by the choice of elementary gates @xmath89 .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : fullmult ] ) , we have to apply the ( controlled version ) of the multiplication operator for all values @xmath109 in our numerical simulations we have ensured by the proper choice of @xmath110 that @xmath111 is identical @xmath112 to @xmath113 if for @xmath114 we have @xmath115 , otherwise , we have chosen different realizations of @xmath116 for each value of @xmath117 assuming that the @xmath8-dependence of the hard coded implementation is sufficiently complex to render @xmath95 uncorrelated for different values of @xmath8 .",
    "this introduces some kind of slight correlation that takes into account the static property of the imperfections .",
    "however , we have also checked that neglecting these correlations ( choosing each time a different realization of @xmath95 even if the same @xmath8-value appears again ) does not affect significantly our numerical results discussed below .",
    "we also note that in potential applications ( for `` real '' quantum computers ) with larger values of @xmath3 and @xmath12 , @xmath21 these kind of correlations will become less important .",
    "so , in majority of cases for each @xmath19 we have @xmath118 with independent random realizations of @xmath116 in eq .",

    "( [ heffcalc ] ) , ( [ hjdeff ] ) and should directly couple many qubits in the computational register .",
    "our model ( [ heffmodel ] ) for the imperfections is quite convenient for numerical computations and is similar to the model used in @xcite but with a difference that in those works it is the elementary residual hamiltonian @xmath87 which is chosen in this way [ see eq .",
    "( [ multproduct_static ] ) ] .",
    "therefore we should expect that @xmath95 has a more complicated structure than ( [ heffmodel ] ) .",
    "however , choosing @xmath120 and @xmath121 of comparable size we are well in the quantum chaos regime @xcite and therefore the model ( [ heffmodel ] ) describes well the effects of static imperfections .",
    "it should be also noted that the quantum gates of the algorithm introduce additional strong mixing between all qubits even if they are not directly coupled by @xmath122 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "we also checked that a change of @xmath122 from the form of eq .",
    "( [ heffmodel ] ) to the case when all qubits are coupled by residual interactions does not affect significantly the results of numerical simulations .",
    "this is in agreement with the results obtained in @xcite .",
    "another advantage of a choice of @xmath122 in the form ( [ heffmodel ] ) is the local structure of couplings between qubits that corresponds to a physical reality .",
    "it is also important to note that when we have @xmath123 gates as in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , then the effective strength of @xmath124 is effectively renormalized as @xmath125 since static errors in each realization of @xmath126 ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) are independent and random .",
    "we leave the question about possible strong correlations between @xmath126 due to a specific implementation of the algorithm for future studies .",
    "the above consideration assumes that sufficient randomization of static imperfections takes place along the path of a specific quantum circuit for the modular multiplication .",
    "in this case we may assume that the effective hamiltonian @xmath122 in the propagator contains different random couplings between qubits for each value of @xmath8 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ heffcalc]-[jdelta ] ) ) .",
    "however , it is possible that the errors remain well correlated along the path of this circuit and in this case it is more appropriate to consider that @xmath122 does not depend on @xmath8 and remain the same along the whole shor s algorithm . in our numeral studies we mainly concentrate on the first possibility ( `` generic imperfection model '' ) but in order to have the complete picture of the effects of static imperfections we also considered the second case with @xmath122 remaining constant along the full circuit ( `` correlated imperfection model '' ) . according to our previous discussion",
    "the important property of both models is that the errors appear only via the positions of the propagator @xmath127 between the modular multiplications in the full circuit of the algorithm .",
    "hence the specific implementation of the modular multiplication circuit does not affect the random properties of inter - qubit couplings in @xmath122 .",
    "therefore , once the parametric dependence on the imperfection strength @xmath124 , number of qubits @xmath21 and number of gates @xmath128 is established through numerical simulations , we can apply these results to arbitrary implementations currently discussed in the literature .    in some sense",
    ", the model of static errors considered here can be viewed as a kind of generic static error model .",
    "it shows sufficiently rich and generic effects of errors and due to its certain simplicity allows to make numerical simulations with factorization of larger @xmath3 values compared to previous numerical studies @xcite .",
    "this allowed us to determine the accuracy dependence on the parameters and to obtain the scaling law for a large number of qubits .",
    "this required to perform extensive numerical simulations with up to 30 qubits which became possible because we neglected the errors in the work space qubits .",
    "however , as soon as we obtain the parametric dependence of the algorithm accuracy we may reincorporate the effect of imperfections in the work space by modifying the effective qubit number in the computational register .",
    "we also neglected the static imperfections in the control register since the number of gates in the qft ( operating in the control register ) is much smaller than the number of gates in the main part of shor s algorithm .",
    "however , in the case of the correlated imperfection model , we verified that the introduction of couplings in the control register does not modify the established parametric dependence on the number qubits .",
    "we emphasize that our numerical calculations keep the exact quantum entanglement for the whole quantum evolution with up to 30 qubits .",
    "we note that a further increase of the factorized number @xmath3 can be achieved by replacing the control register by one qubit combined with appropriate measurements of this qubit and a semiclassical implementation of the qft @xcite .",
    "however , this approach simulates the quantum measurement process in the algorithm and does not give a direct access to the full probability distribution in the quantum register which is substantially used in our studies .",
    "we present obtained numerical results in the next section .",
    "the effects of static imperfections in shor s algorithm are studied numerically following the approach described in the previous section : a wave vector of size @xmath129 is propagated numerically according to the quantum circuits shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1],[fig2 ] , all quantum gates are assumed to be exact , the imperfections , induced by residual couplings between qubits in the computational register , are encountered by the propagators @xmath130 appearing @xmath12 times in the circuit as it is described in fig  [ fig2 ] .",

    "<S> we study effects of imperfections induced by residual couplings between qubits on the accuracy of shor s algorithm using numerical simulations of realistic quantum computations with up to 30 qubits . the factoring of numbers up to @xmath0 show that the width of peaks , which frequencies allow to determine the factors , grow exponentially with the number of qubits . </S>",
    "<S> however , the algorithm remains operational up to a critical coupling strength @xmath1 which drops only polynomially with @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath2 is explained by analytical estimates that allows to obtain the scaling for functionality of shor s algorithm on realistic quantum computers with a large number of qubits . </S>"
