    "nevertheless , the three - loop results obtained in @xcite do not agree with the nsvz @xmath2-function .",
    "however @xcite this disagreement can be eliminated by a special choice of renormalization scheme , the possibility of such a choice being highly nontrivial @xcite .",
    "actually it is possible to relate @xmath7 scheme and nsvz scheme order by order @xcite in the perturbation theory .",
    "it is worth mentioning , that at two - loops the nsvz @xmath2-function was also obtained with differential renormalization @xcite .",

    "this solution is different from the one , given by shifman and vainshtein .",
    "moreover , it contradicts the results of explicit two - loop calculations , made with dred .",
    "it would be natural to suppose , that in the holomorphic normalization the @xmath2-function is exhausted at the one - loop if higher covariant derivative regularization @xcite , supplemented by the pauli - villars , is used .",

    "the explicit two - loop calculations for theories , regularized by higher derivatives ( hd ) , were made first in @xcite for @xmath4 susy qed and gave a zero two - loop contribution to the @xmath2-function defined by - function , that is proportional to the trace anomaly . ]",
    "@xmath11    this result implies the absence of the anomaly puzzle in view of the solution proposed in @xcite .",

    "the calculations of this contribution with different regularizations were analysed in @xcite , where the difference of the results for the scheme independent two - loop @xmath2-function was attributed to the mathematical inconsistency of dred @xcite , which had been pointed in @xcite . in particular , the inconsistency of dred leads to incorrect zero results for anomalies , because dred does not break the chiral symmetry .",

    "hd regularization is mathematically consistent and allows to calculate anomalies correctly . in particular , the anomalous contribution to the @xmath2-function , obtained with hd , is not equal to 0 . actually this contribution is a sum of feynman diagrams with insersions of counterterms on matter lines .",
    "the sum of such diagrams is equal to 0 with dred and agrees with the results of @xcite and @xcite with hd regularization .",
    "after rescaling , which converts ( [ holomorphic_normalization ] ) into ( [ canonical_normalization ] ) , the diagrams with insersions of counterterms vanish , and the @xmath2-function becomes equal to the nsvz expression .",
    "it is necessary to note , that although the @xmath2-function ( [ beta_definition ] ) is exausted by the first loop in the holomorphic normalization , the gell - mann - low function has contributions from all orders .",
    "this contradiction is discussed in the present paper .",

    "[ section_conclusion ]    in this paper we calculated the three - loop @xmath2-function for @xmath4 susy qed regularized by higher derivatives . using the standard definition of the generating functional we found , that two- and three - loop contributions to the @xmath2-function ( [ beta_gamma_definition ] ) were 0 for a large number of subtraction schemes . in this case",
    "the sum of diagrams without insersions of counterterms on matter lines is exactly equal to the terms of the corresponding order in the expansion of the nsvz @xmath2-function .",
    "however two- and three - loop contributions are exactly cancelled by diagrams containing insersions of counterterms .    the result for @xmath2-function ( [ beta_gamma_definition ] ) obtained with hd regularization differs from the corresponding result obtained with dred , because dred is not mathematically consistent and does not permit to calculate anomalies @xcite ( if there are no additional assumtions like @xmath12 e.t.c . ) .",
    "in particular , the konishi anomaly , which contributes to @xmath2-function ( [ beta_gamma_definition ] ) , calculated with dred is 0 .",
    "this in turn leads to the anomaly puzzle .",
    "hd regularization enables us to find an anomalous contribution of diagrams with insersions of the counterterms , which was calculated in @xcite exactly to all orders and is equal to    @xmath160    the calculations done in this paper confirm this result in the three - loop approximation .",
    "the result for @xmath2-function ( [ beta_gamma_definition ] ) , obtained with the generating functional ( [ modified_z ] ) , is consistent with a multiplet structure of the anomalies : since in supersymmetric theories the axial and the trace of the energy - momentum tensor anomalies are members of a supersymmetric multiplet , the @xmath2-function ( [ beta_gamma_definition ] ) should be exhausted by the first loop . in particular ,",
    "if the theory is regularized by hd the adler - bardeen theorem does not conflict with supersymmetry , while for theories , regularized by dred , such a contradiction seems to take place @xcite .    however , the generating functional ( [ modified_z ] ) depends on @xmath16 due to the rescaling anomaly . as a consequence ,",
    "the @xmath2-function ( [ gl_function ] ) is different from the one defined by equation ( [ beta_gamma_definition ] ) .",
    "if we would like to define a @xmath16-independent generating functional , then either adler - bardeen theorem is not valid or the trace anomaly is not proportional to the @xmath2-function .",
    "therefore , if the generating functional does not depend on the normalization point , then the arguments based on the multiplet structure of anomalies can not be used . in our opinion",
    "this solves the anomaly puzzle in the considered model .",
    "one of the possible ways to define a @xmath16-independent generating functional is the using of the canonical normalization ( [ canonical_normalization ] ) .",
    "then there are no diagrams with insersions of counterterms and the @xmath2-function is equal to the nsvz expression .",
    "it is important to note , that unlike dred the hd regularization does not require to tune the subtraction scheme .",
    "the nsvz expression ( at least in the three - loop approximation ) for @xmath2-function ( [ beta_gamma_definition ] ) is authomatically obtained with hd regularization if an operator , constructing a counterterm for a given function , is linear .",
    "it is necessary to note , that so far we considered only the abelian case .",
    "for the supersymmetric yang - mills theory the using of higher covariant derivative regularization @xcite leads to very involved calculations , because in this case feynman rules become much more complicated . in this case the using of usual derivatives",
    "can simplify the calculations considerably .",
    "however , such regularization breaks the gauge invariance .",
    "nevertheless , even in the case of noninvariant regularization it is possible to obtain the gauge invariant renormalized effective action by a special choice of subtraction scheme @xcite . for abelian supersymmetric theories",
    "such scheme was proposed in @xcite .",
    "construction of the invariant renormalization procedure for supersymmetric non - abelian models is in progress .",
