    "while there are numerous invariants for embeddings of graphs in @xmath1-manifolds , most have limited applications either because they are hard to compute or because they are only defined for particular types of graphs .",
    "for example , thompson @xcite defined a powerful polynomial invariant for graphs embedded in arbitrary 3-manifolds , which can detect whether an embedding of a graph in @xmath0 is planar .",
    "however , computing thompson s invariant requires identifying topological features of a sequence of 3-manifolds , such as whether each manifold is compressible .",

    "also , the yamada polynomial can be used to detect whether a spatial graph with vertices of degree at most 3 is chiral ( i.e. , distinct from its mirror image ) . the yokota polynomial is an ambient isotopy invariant for all spatial graphs that reduces to the yamada polynomial for graphs with vertices of degree at most 3 . however , the yokota polynomial is more difficult to compute , and can not be used to show that a spatial graph is chiral .    in a lecture in 1990 ,",
    "jon simon introduced an invariant of embeddings of the graphs @xmath2 and @xmath3 with labeled vertices in @xmath0 .",
    "the simon invariant is easy to compute from a projection of an embedding and has been useful in obtaining results about embeddings of non - planar graphs @xcite . in 1995 , taniyama @xcite showed that the simon invariant is a special case of a cohomology invariant for all spatial graphs which had been introduced by wu @xcite , and showed that the wu invariant can be defined combinatorially from a graph projection .",
    "however , the wu invariant is not always easy to compute , and ( like the simon invariant ) depends on the choice of labeling of the vertices of a graph .",
    "for this reason , the role of the wu invariant in distinguishing a spatial graph from its mirror image has been limited to showing that for any embedded non - planar graph @xmath4 , there is no orientation reversing homeomorphism of @xmath5 that fixes every vertex of @xmath4 ( see @xcite ) . without this restriction on the vertices ,",

    ", we define numerical invariants that are obtained by reducing the wu invariant and by generalizing the simon invariant .",
    "we then use our invariants to prove that no matter how the complete graph @xmath6 , the mbius ladders @xmath7 , and the heawood graph are embedded in @xmath0 , there is no orientation reversing homeomorphism of @xmath0 which takes the embedded graph to itself . finally , we show that our invariants can be used to give a lower bound on the minimal crossing number of embedded graphs .",

    "[ cr]let @xmath21 be an embedding of an oriented graph @xmath20 in @xmath0 with generalized simon invariant @xmath121 , and let @xmath392 be the minimum crossing number of all projections of all embeddings ambient isotopic @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath393 be the maximum of @xmath394 over all pairs of disjoint edges in @xmath20 .",
    "then @xmath395    fix a diagram of @xmath49 which realizes the minimal crossing number @xmath392 . observe that @xmath392 includes crossings between an edge and itself as well as crossings between adjacent edges , which are not included in @xmath396 .",
    "therefore , we have the following sequence of inequalities .",
    "thus we have the result .",
    "since every reduced wu invariant with respect to a given homomorphism @xmath92 is a generalized simon invariant with epsilon coefficients given by @xmath67 , theorem [ cr ] is true for any reduced wu invariant @xmath93 .",
    "recall from example [ 2k3_2 ] that the reduced wu invariant of @xmath291 is twice the linking number . thus applying theorem [ cr ] to an embedding of @xmath291",
    "gives us the well known fact that the minimal crossing number of a @xmath398-component link is at least twice the absolute value of the linking number .",
    "applying theorem [ cr ] to examples [ k5 ] and [ k33 ] shows that the minimal crossing number of any spatial embedding of @xmath2 or @xmath3 is at least the absolute value of the simon invariant .",

    "since @xmath399 for any projection of @xmath21 , it follows from theorem [ cr ] that @xmath400 .",
    "it is not hard to check that these epsilon coefficients indeed give us a generalized simon invariant for @xmath110 . alternatively ,",
    "if we let @xmath404 be the triangle with vertices @xmath137 , @xmath405 , and @xmath140 and let @xmath406 be the triangle with vertices @xmath407 , @xmath408 , and @xmath409 , then we can define @xmath93 as the sum of @xmath410 together with the simon invariant of the oriented @xmath3-subgraph obtained from @xmath110 by deleting @xmath404 and @xmath406 .",
    "let @xmath21 be the spatial embedding of @xmath107 illustrated in figure [ k6simon2 ] , where the rectangle represents the number of positive crossings .",
    "we compute the generalized simon invariant @xmath93 as :      since @xmath412 , it follows from theorem  [ cr ] that @xmath413 .",
    "the projection in figure  [ k6simon2 ] has @xmath414 crossings .",
    "thus this projection has a minimal number of crossings .",
    "in particular , this means that for every odd number @xmath415 , there is an embedding @xmath173 of @xmath110 in @xmath0 such that @xmath416 .",
