    "as mentioned in the abstract , the goal of this paper is to introduce two ways within the algorithmic approach to the study of the tilings @xmath0 when @xmath1  is odd .",
    "this approach is in the spirit of what has be done by the author starting from the basic paper  @xcite .    in section  [ hypgeom ] ,",
    "we remind the reader the basic features of hyperbolic geometry , in particular what is needed to define and to study the tilings @xmath0 . in section  [ whenevenq ] ,",
    "we remind the splitting of the hyperbolic plane leading to a spanning tree of the tiling @xmath0 when @xmath1  is even . in section  [ whenoddq ]",
    ", we consider the tiling @xmath0 when @xmath1  is odd . in subsection  [ basic ] , we remind the construction performed in  @xcite . in subsections  [ split1 ] and  [ split2 ] , we present the two ways of splitting mentioned in the abstract .",
    "both ways have nice properties except in one case , when @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "subsection  [ til45 ] is devoted to the study of this case .",
    "in this section , we first remind poincar s disc model and a few features which will allow us to define tessellations in the hyperbolic plane which we shall study in subsection  [ tessellations ]      hyperbolic geometry appeared in the first half of the 19@xmath4 century , proving the independence of the parallel axiom of euclidean geometry .",
    "models were devised in the second half of the 19@xmath4 century and we shall use here one of the most popular ones , poincar s disc .",
    "figure  [ poincare_disc ] illustrates the parallel axiom of hyperbolic geometry in this model .",
    "110=    in poincar s disc model , the points of the hyperbolic plane are exactly those which are inside a once for all fixed open disc of the euclidean plane .",
    "the border of the disc is called the set of * points at infinity*. note that the points at infinity do not belong to the hyperbolic plane .",
    "lines are trace of diameters or circles orthogonal to the border of the disc , see the line  @xmath5 in figure  [ poincare_disc ] . in this figure",
    ", we have a point  @xmath6 not on  @xmath5 and we can see a line  @xmath7 which cuts  @xmath5 .",
    "two lines passing through  @xmath6 play a particular role : the lines @xmath8 and  @xmath1 , which touch  @xmath5 in the model at  @xmath9 and  @xmath10 which are points at infinity .",
    "these lines are called * parallel * to  @xmath5 .",
    "more generally , in the model , two lines are parallel if and only if they have a common point at infinity .",
    "now , figure  [ poincare_disc ] shows that there is another important case which has no counterpart in the euclidean plane : the line  @xmath11 also passes through  @xmath6 without cutting  @xmath5 , neither inside the disc nor outside it .",
    "such a line is called * non - secant * with  @xmath5 .",
    "non - secant lines are characterized by the fact that they have a unique common perpendicular .",
    "this is also a specific property of the hyperbolic plane where there can not be rectangles .",
    "another important property , equivalent to the parallel axiom of this geometry is that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always less than  @xmath12 , the measure of the straight angle .",
    "henri poincar also established an important theorem from which we know that there is an infinite family of tilings in the hyperbolic plane when in the euclidean plane the same definition leads to three tilings only , up to similarity .",
    "to state the theorem , we have to remember the definition of a * tessellation*. consider the following process .",
    "we start from a single polygon  @xmath9 and we replicate it by reflection in its sides .",
    "then , recursively , we replicate the images of  @xmath9 by reflection in their sides .",
    "if the images do not overlap and if any point of the plane is contained in at least one image , we say that we have a tiling which is generated from  @xmath9 by tessellation .",
    "we also call the tiling a tessellation generated by  @xmath9 .    in the late 19@xmath4 century , henri poincar proved the following :    a triangle  @xmath13 of the hyperbolic plane generates a tessellation if and only if its angles are of the form , and , where @xmath8 , @xmath1 and  @xmath14 are positive integers satisfying .    note that the condition merely says that @xmath13  is a triangle of the hyperbolic plane .",
    "an important particular case of this theorem is the case when @xmath9  is a regular polygon .",
    "this case can be derived from the theorem by considering the rectangular triangle  @xmath13 which is constructed from  @xmath9 by taking as vertices the centre of  @xmath9 and the end - points of a half - side .",
    "if @xmath8  is the number of sides of  @xmath9 and if is its interior angle , then the angles of  @xmath13 are , and .",
    "accordingly , the condition is now .",
    "remark that , in the euclidean plane , we can perform the same construction starting from a rectangular triangle  @xmath13 .",
    "this time , as the sum of angles of a triangle in the euclidean plane is  @xmath12 , we get that necessarily , , which gives three solutions exactly : @xmath15 , @xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "this gives us the square , the regular hexagon and the equilateral triangle respectively .    in the hyperbolic plane",
    ", we have an infinite family .",
    "moreover , it is defined with @xmath18 and then @xmath20 , or with @xmath17 and then @xmath21 or when @xmath22 and then @xmath23 or when @xmath24 and then @xmath25 .",
    "remember that in the case @xmath26 called the * pentagrid * , very simple tools to navigate in this tiling were devised , see  @xcite .",
    "this was extended to the tilings @xmath27 in  @xcite , then to the tiling @xmath28 called the heptagrid in  @xcite , later to the tilings @xmath0 in  @xcite .",
    "all these tilings fall under the class of * combinatoric tilings * defined in  @xcite . in this class , we have an algorithmic way to study the tiling which is based on the construction of a tree which spans the tiling .",
    "the tree is associated to a process of partition of the hyperbolic plane which generates several tiles at each step of the construction .",
    "the construction produces the whole tiling in infinite time .",
    "it is important to notice that there is a bijection between the tree and the tiles of the tiling .",
    "a particular way to number the nodes of the tree provides us with efficient tools of navigation in the tiling initially established in  @xcite for the pentagrid and then generalized as above indicated",
    ".    a precise description of these results and their proofs together with the references can be found in  @xcite .",
    "what we remind in section  [ whenevenq ] will give an insight in the method and its results .    in our next section ,",
    "we turn to the general case of the tilings @xmath0 when @xmath1  is even .",
    "later , in section  [ whenoddq ] , we introduce the new idea and its application to an appropriate splitting of the hyperbolic plane leading to another construction of the tilings @xmath0 when @xmath1 is odd .",
    "here , we remind the splitting of the hyperbolic plane thoroughly explained and analyzed in  @xcite .",
    "it leads to an algorithmic construction , in infinite time , of the tiling @xmath0 when @xmath1  is even .",
    "the case when @xmath1  is odd , which is more complex , will be dealt with in the next section .    when @xmath1  is even , we define a * sector *  @xmath29 as the angular sector defined by taking a vertex  @xmath30 of the polygon  @xmath9 on which the tiling is constructed and the rays issued from  @xmath30 which supports the two edges of  @xmath9 which meet at  @xmath30 .",
    "we call @xmath30 the * vertex * of  @xmath29 and @xmath9 is its * head*. it is easy to see that the whole tiling is the union of @xmath1  copies of  @xmath29 which share the same vertex .    number the edges of  @xmath9 @xmath31 , ... , @xmath32 , the numbers increasing while clockwise turning around  @xmath9",
    ". similarly , denote by  @xmath33, ... ,@xmath34 the vertices of  @xmath9 , deciding that @xmath35 and  @xmath36 are the end - points of  @xmath31 .",
    "we also assume that the lines supporting @xmath31 and  @xmath32 also support the rays  @xmath37 and  @xmath38 issued from  @xmath35 which define @xmath29 .",
    "as @xmath1  is even , we can write @xmath39 and we can easily see that the angle between @xmath40 and  @xmath38 which is outside  @xmath9 and inside @xmath29 is @xmath41@xmath42@xmath43 , see figure  [ split_evs0 ] .",
    "and so , @xmath44@xmath421 copies of @xmath29 exactly fill up the region  @xmath45 which is outside  @xmath9 , inside  @xmath29 and between  @xmath37 and the line which supports  @xmath40 .",
    "say that @xmath45 is a * fan * of @xmath44@xmath421 copies of  @xmath29 .",
    "we can define similar regions @xmath46 which are fans of @xmath44@xmath421 copies of  @xmath29 , with @xmath47@xmath42@xmath48 .",
    "indeed , @xmath49 is bordered by the continuation of  @xmath50 and the side  @xmath51 and its continuation outside  @xmath9 and outside  @xmath46 . now , the complement in @xmath29 of  @xmath9 and all the @xmath46 s we have just defined is a new region  @xmath52 .",
    "this region is defined by  @xmath53 , @xmath54 and  @xmath32 , the angles between @xmath54 and its neighbouring edges inside  @xmath55 being both @xmath41@xmath42@xmath43 .",
    "110=    let @xmath56 be the reflection of  @xmath9 in  @xmath54 .",
    "denote by  @xmath37 the continuation of @xmath53 and by  @xmath38 that of  @xmath32 .",
    "the splitting of  @xmath55 is a bit different from that of  @xmath29 , but it relies on the same considerations . rename  @xmath31 the edge of  @xmath56 which is shared with  @xmath9 and denote by  @xmath50 the other sides of  @xmath56 , @xmath57 , the numbering being increasing while clockwise turning around  @xmath56 .",
    "we notice that this time , in the complement in  @xmath55 of  @xmath56 , @xmath37 and @xmath40 define an angle which is @xmath41@xmath42@xmath58 , so that we split this region , say  @xmath45 into  @xmath41@xmath42@xmath59 copies of  @xmath29 : this time , we have a fan of  @xmath41@xmath42@xmath59 copies of  @xmath29 . the next regions @xmath46 are defined by  @xmath60 and  @xmath51 in the complement in  @xmath55 of  @xmath9 and the regions  @xmath61 for @xmath62 , @xmath63 and  @xmath50 . but , for @xmath47@xmath42@xmath48 , each @xmath46 is a fan of @xmath44@xmath42@xmath64 copies of  @xmath29 .",
    "now , the other ray  @xmath38 and  @xmath32 define in the complement of  @xmath9 in  @xmath55 another region  @xmath65 which is also a fan of  @xmath41@xmath42@xmath59 copies of  @xmath29 : this copies are obtained by using an odd number of reflections in lines .",
    "now , what remains in  @xmath55 after removing  @xmath65 is a region  @xmath66 which is a copy of  @xmath55 , see figure  [ split_evs1 ] .",
    "accordingly , we have split @xmath55 into a copy of  @xmath9 , @xmath67@xmath42@xmath68@xmath42@xmath69 copies of  @xmath29 and one copy of  @xmath55 .",
    "note that we can write the splitting as follows : which is the splitting given in  @xcite .",
    "110=    we briefly remind the consequence of the just computed relations . from them",
    ", we easily derive a matrix which we interpret as an * incident matrix * called the * matrix of the splitting*. the rows indicate how a region is split in terms of the basic regions , @xmath29 and  @xmath55 .",
    "the columns indicate how many copies of the considered region enter the splitting of the region associated to the considered line . from the matrix , we get its characteristic polynomial which here we call the * polynomial of the splitting*. it is not difficult to see that the polynomial is . it is known that , this polynomial has a real root  @xmath70 which is positive and greater than  1 , see  @xcite .",
    "it is also known that the recurrent relation obtained from the polynomial defines a sequence of increasing positive numbers in which we can decompose any natural number with sums of terms of the sequence , each term entering the sum being multiplied by an integer whose range is 0 .. @xmath71 , where @xmath72 .",
    "it is known that , in general , the representation is not unique .",
    "however , it can be made unique by requiring that we take the longest representation in terms of number of digits .",
    "we call the set of these maximal representations the * language of the splitting*. now , it is also known that the language is regular if and only if @xmath70 is a pisot number , which means that @xmath73 and that if @xmath74 is the other root , @xmath75 .",
    "we know that most of the languages associated to a tiling  @xmath0 are regular but they are very different .",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite for the corresponding study .",
    "when @xmath1  is odd , we can no more split the tiling using lines which support the sides of the tiles . in  @xcite",
    ", we solved the problem by using a zig - zag line which follows sides of the tiles . in subsection  [ basic ] , we remind the main lines of this splitting and its main properties . in subsection",
    "[ split1 ] , we describe the new idea and a way of splitting which we can straightforward devise from it .      in  @xcite we define the basic regions by using a zig - zag line constituted of sides of the tiling .",
    "each side is defined from the previous one by making a constant angle defined by @xmath76 , where @xmath77 .",
    "this angle is the biggest positive integral multiple of @xmath78 which is less than the straight angle .",
    "more precisely , fix an edge  @xmath31 .",
    "let  @xmath30 be the vertex to which we arrive after choosing  @xmath31 .",
    "denote the other vertices by @xmath40 ,  ... ,  @xmath79 .",
    "the angle between @xmath50 and  @xmath51 is @xmath78 for @xmath80@xmath42@xmath81 and it is the same for the angle between @xmath79 and  @xmath31 .",
    "now , it is plain that @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the closest to the line which supports  @xmath31 : both these edges make an angle @xmath76 with  @xmath31 .",
    "we decide to number the edges in the following way : the last chosen edge is always  @xmath31 .",
    "the other edges are numbered from  2 up to  @xmath1 by counter clockwise turning around  @xmath30 , the vertex to which @xmath31  arrives and from which the edges @xmath50 are issued , @xmath84 .",
    "the next vertex is @xmath82 : it becomes the new value of  @xmath31 and its other end becomes the new value of  @xmath30 .",
    "see figure  [ vertex_0 ] which illustrates this process .",
    "110=    with these conventions , it is possible to define two regions @xmath29 and @xmath55 which provide results very close to those obtained in the case when @xmath1  is even . figures  [ split_odds0 ] and  [ split_odds1 ]",
    "illustrate the situation in the case when @xmath85 .",
    "this is enough to allow us to see how the splitting is performed in this case . in particular",
    ", we find the same splitting matrix as in the case when @xmath1  is even .",
    "110=    110=      now , we turn to the new splittings announced in the abstract and in section  [ intro ] .",
    "both the new splittings are based on the same notion of a mid - point line .",
    "this notion was introduced in the heptagrid , in order to define the regions of the splitting giving rise to this tiling . in this case , a mid - point line is a line which joins mid - points of consecutive edges of the tiling .",
    "110=    it is not difficult to see that when @xmath86 , this property of the mid - points of edges is no more true : three mid - points @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 such that @xmath87 with  @xmath88 and @xmath88 with @xmath89belong to the same heptagon but @xmath87 and @xmath89 belong to different ones are never on the same line . in the next subsubsection",
    ", we shall see that however , there is a way to generalize the mid - points of the heptagrid .",
    "then , in subsubsection  [ splitnew1 ] and in subsection  [ split2 ] we shall see the application of this new construction to two variants of a splitting of the tiling @xmath0 in the case when @xmath1  is odd .",
    "subsubsection  [ til45 ] will deal in another way for the special case when @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath77 , as this number will play an important role . in our new setting",
    ", we shall again use a mid - point line , but this time , it will be defined by the angle @xmath76 . note that when @xmath17 , @xmath90 , so that this definition is a natural generalization of what we did in the heptagrid . indeed ,",
    "consider  @xmath30 a vertex of  @xmath9 , a regular polygon with @xmath8  sides and @xmath1  copies of  @xmath9 exactly covering a neighbourhood of a vertex .",
    "let @xmath91 be the copies around  @xmath30 covering one of its neighbourhoods .",
    "assume that @xmath92 and let the others , @xmath93 be increasingly numbered while counter clockwise turning around  @xmath30 .",
    "let  @xmath94 be the side of  @xmath9 abutting  @xmath30 which is not shared by  @xmath95 .",
    "the continuation of  @xmath96 cuts @xmath97 into two parts which are the reflection of each other in the continuation of  @xmath96 .",
    "let  @xmath98 be the side of  @xmath99 which makes the angle  @xmath76 with  @xmath96 at  @xmath30 .",
    "let @xmath100  be the mid - point of  @xmath96 and let @xmath101  be that of  @xmath98 .",
    "let @xmath102 be the line joining  @xmath100 and  @xmath101 .",
    "let  @xmath103 be the other end - point of  @xmath98 .",
    "consider the angle at  @xmath103 defined by  @xmath98 which is @xmath76 , but defined clockwise .",
    "this defines the side  @xmath71 of one copy of  @xmath9 among those which , dispatched around  @xmath103 exactly cover a neighbourhood of this point .",
    "now , from the above definition of angles , it is not difficult to see that with respect to the line  @xmath104 supporting  @xmath98 we have that @xmath96 lies in one of the half - plane delimited by  @xmath104 and @xmath71  lies in the other .",
    "let @xmath105 be the mid - point of  @xmath71 .",
    "the triangles @xmath106 and @xmath107 are equal and this shows that @xmath102 also joins  @xmath101 to  @xmath105 , see figure  [ vertex_new ] as @xmath30 and  @xmath103 are not on the same side of  @xmath104 . in this way , we can see that @xmath102  is a line of mid - points of sides of the tiles , but instead of joining mid - points of consecutive edges , it joins mid - points of edges of the tiles which make the angle @xmath76 : we shall say that the line joins * @xmath44-consecutive mid - points*. from now on , we shall call * @xmath44-mid - point lines * the lines which joins @xmath44-consecutive mid - points .",
    "110=      now , we are ready to define the splitting .    first , define a sector  @xmath29 to be delimited by a vertex  @xmath30 , called the vertex of  @xmath29 .",
    "the head of the sector is a copy of  @xmath9 for which  @xmath30 is a vertex .",
    "let @xmath71 and  @xmath108 denote the sides of  @xmath9 which meet at  @xmath30 .",
    "the bisector of the angle between @xmath71 and  @xmath108 at  @xmath30 which is outside  @xmath9 is the edge  @xmath98 of a copy of  @xmath9 among the @xmath1  copies of  @xmath9 which can be put around  @xmath30 .",
    "let @xmath109 , @xmath110 and  @xmath6 be the mid - points of  @xmath108 , @xmath71 and  @xmath98 respectively .",
    "we may assume that we go from  @xmath108 to  @xmath71 by counter clockwise turning around  @xmath30 .",
    "let @xmath111 be the ray issued from  @xmath110 whose supporting line goes through  @xmath6 .",
    "we take the ray which does not contain  @xmath6 .",
    "note that the ray is supported by a @xmath44-mid - point line .",

    "clearly , @xmath112 is also a @xmath44-mid - point line : the next mid - point on this ray , starting from  @xmath109 belongs to an edge of a tile which is outside  @xmath9 , see figure  [ sect_s0 ] .",
    "we define @xmath29 as the region delimited by @xmath30 , @xmath110 , @xmath109 and both rays @xmath111 and  @xmath112 . from the definition of  @xmath111",
    ", we easily conclude that the tiling @xmath0 can exactly be split into @xmath1  copies of  @xmath29 .",
    "110=    consider the region @xmath29 , as illustrated in figure  [ split_s0 ] .",
    "the figure indicates how we split this region .",
    "there is a small difference with the case when @xmath1  is even : we have to introduce three regions in order to get a combinatoric splitting .",
    "first , consider the delimitation of the sector . on the figure ,",

    "we consider the ray issued from  @xmath117 and which goes through the mid - point  @xmath118 of  @xmath114 . on figure  [ split_s0 ]",

    "this is why we define the set of tiles spanned by  @xmath29 as those which have at most one vertex outside  @xmath29 .",
    "110=    now , from this remark , we can say that there is a fan of @xmath44@xmath421 copies of @xmath29 delimited by @xmath36 , the ray issue from  @xmath120 and supported by that joining  @xmath88 to  @xmath120 and the ray issued from  @xmath89 and passing through  @xmath121 .",

    "so , we can summarize the splitting of  @xmath29 by writing :    now , as @xmath130 is obtained from  @xmath29 by just removing a copy of  @xmath130 , we immediately get that the splitting of  @xmath130 , illustrated by figure  [ split_sb0 ] can be summarized by the following formula :    110=    presently , we arrive at the splitting of  @xmath55 .",
    "everything goes as for  @xmath29 , taking into account the following : for defining  @xmath55 , we need @xmath8@xmath421 sides of  @xmath9 , but we have to take into account the mid - points of the edges of the reflection of  @xmath9 in  @xmath131 which have @xmath35 and  @xmath36 as end - points , see figure  [ split_s1 ] .",

    "it can be seen that the continuation of the rays @xmath208 and  @xmath209 issued from  @xmath109 define again a copy of  @xmath130 which contains exactly the tiles contained in this angular sector and which are not contained neither in the sector defined by @xmath207 and  @xmath208 nor that which is defined by @xmath209 and  @xmath210 .",
    "110=    this means that , around a vertex , the @xmath1  polygons which meet at this vertex define @xmath1  copies of  @xmath130 which do not cover the hyperbolic plane . in between two consecutive copies of  @xmath130 ,",
    "there is room for exactly one copy .",
    "accordingly , we can split the hyperbolic plane into @xmath211  copies of  @xmath130 , reproducing @xmath1  times the scheme represented by figure  [ deuxsect_sb0 ] .",
    "now , consider figure  [ deuxsect_sb0 ] .",
    "as the side @xmath212  is a rotated image of the side  @xmath98 , we get that @xmath209 is a rotated image of  @xmath207 under the same rotation .",
    "now , we have just seen that the continuation of the rays @xmath208 and  @xmath209 issued from  @xmath109 define again a copy of  @xmath130 .",
    "this means that @xmath29 can be split into two copies of  @xmath130 exactly .",
    "accordingly , the splittings of  @xmath130 and @xmath55 illustrated by figures  [ split_sb0 ] and  [ split_s1 ] can be adapted to the regions @xmath130 and  @xmath55 only .",
    "this gives us the following formulas :    110=    this time , the polynomial of the splitting is : as @xmath39 + 1 , this can be rewritten as    when @xmath20 , the last coefficient of this polynomial of degree  2 is negative and so it has a positive real root  @xmath70 .",
    "we remark that    @xmath213@xmath42@xmath214@xmath42@xmath215@xmath42@xmath214@xmath42@xmath216 ,    as @xmath217 and @xmath67@xmath42@xmath214@xmath42@xmath218 when @xmath22 and @xmath219 .",
    "so that @xmath220@xmath42@xmath214@xmath42@xmath221 . consequently , if @xmath74 is the other root of the polynomial , it is also a real number and we have that    @xmath222@xmath42@xmath223@xmath423 , and so @xmath224 ,    as @xmath225 . and so , @xmath75 which means that @xmath9  is a pisot polynomial .",
    "we remain with the cases when @xmath155 and @xmath156 .    when @xmath155 , the polynomial is now : @xmath226@xmath42@xmath227@xmath42@xmath228 when @xmath25 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath9  has a real root @xmath70 , with @xmath229@xmath42@xmath230 when @xmath25 .",
    "there is another root @xmath74 for which we have @xmath231 , so that @xmath232 as @xmath25 .",
    "when @xmath2 and @xmath155 , we have that @xmath233@xmath42@xmath234@xmath42@xmath59 . as 1",
    "is a root of  @xmath9 , it can not be a pisot polynomial and so , the language of the splitting is not regular in this case , as it is also the case with the splitting of subsection  [ split1 ] .    when @xmath156 , the polynomial becomes @xmath235@xmath42@xmath221+@xmath236 , so that the roots are now @xmath237 and @xmath238@xmath42@xmath221+@xmath239 when @xmath225 . and",
    "so , in this case , @xmath9 is a pisot polynomial .",
    "accordingly , the language of the splitting defined by this new variant is regular in all cases , except in the same case as that induced by the splitting of subsection  [ split1 ] , _ i.e. _ when @xmath2 and @xmath155 .      for this special case ,",
    "corresponding to the case when @xmath2 and @xmath155 in our study of subsections  [ split1 ] and  [ split2 ] , it can be noted that the tiling @xmath240 is the dual tiling of the tiling @xmath26 , the pentagrid for which the language of the splitting is regular . from this remark , we deduce that the coordinates which are used for the pentagrid can also be used for the tiling  @xmath240 . in order to show how to perform this association ,",
    "we remind the construction of the pentagrid using the fibonacci tree which is in bijection with the tiles contained in a quarter , see figure  [ penta ] .",
    "110= 112= 114=    the splitting is summarized by the left - hand side picture of the figure , the middle one showing the recursive construction of the tree yielded by the splitting : the fibonacci tree .",
    "the right - hand side represents the fibonacci tree which can be defined for itself : it has black nodes and white ones . by definition ,",
    "black nodes have two sons , white ones have three sons . for each node , exactly one of its sons is black , always the leftmost one .",
    "the left - hand side picture of figure  [ correspondence ] shows how the pentagrid can be covered by five sectors around a central cell .",
    "110= 112= now , we can perform the announced association as follows .",
    "we start from the splitting given by the left - hand side picture of figure  [ correspondence ] . on the right - hand side picture of the figure",
    ", we have the correspondence for the first three levels of the pentagons .",
    "the idea is to cover all vertices of the pentagons of a sector by numbers in a bijective way , the vertices on the rightmost branch being excluded .",
    "number the sides of a pentagon from  1 to  5 , counter clockwise turning around the tile , number  1 being given to the side shared by the father of the node .",
    "we decide that the father of the head of a sector is the central cell . with this convention",
    ", the number of a tile is given to its vertex shared by sides  1 and  2 for a white node and to its vertex shared by sides  2 and  3 for a black node .",
    "it is easy to see , by induction on the level of the fibonacci tree , that with this process , we completely cover the vertices of all pentagons of a sector , excepted the vertices which are on the right - hand side ray which delimit the sector , including the vertex of the sector .",
    "it is not difficult to see that this algorithm can be generalized to all tilings of the form @xmath241 for which the numbering used for @xmath27 , very close to that of the pentagrid , could be used in place of the one devised in section  [ basic ] .",
    "it is interesting that both the splittings we defined in subsections  [ split1 ] and  [ split2 ] give rise to languages which are always regular , except for the tiling @xmath240 in both cases . as shown in  @xcite",
    ", these languages can be very different .",
    "in particular , there are sharp differences in the forbidden patterns for the language when the constant coefficient of the polynomial of the splitting is positive and when it is negative .      for the splitting of subsection  [ split1 ]",
    ", we have a polynomial of degree  3 , but it is still pisot in all cases but one : when @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the advantage of this splitting is that we have less tiles generated at each node by the splitting . so that the process is here closer to the process defined by the recursive application of the reflection in the sides of the previous generation .",
    "the splitting of subsection  [ split2 ] has two regions only , giving rise to a polynomial of degree  2 which is usually easier to solve than a cubic one .",
    "also , in this case , the language of the splitting is regular in all cases but one : again the case when @xmath2 and @xmath3 as with the other splitting .",
    "however , the number of tiles which are generated is bigger at each generation .",
    "moreover , in one generation of the splitting process we get tiles which are not in contact , neither by an edge nor by a vertex , with the tiles of the current generation .",
    "this is a difference with the traditional definition of a generation .",
    "nevertheless , it can give a formal support to the notion of influence not only on the immediate neighbourhood which may have its own , as the action at a distance in quantum physics or , in mechanics , with gravity .",
    "and so , this splitting might have more advantages than the other .    at last , the algorithm of subsection  [ til45 ] and its generalization to the tilings @xmath241 raises the question whether further generalizations are possible or not .",
    "this is a question for future research ."
