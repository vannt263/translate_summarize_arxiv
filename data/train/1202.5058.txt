    "a key feature of quantum theory is the prediction of correlations that have no classical analogue , i.e. correlations that differ fundamentally from bertlmann s socks @xcite . whereas such quantum correlations were initially considered to be an artifact of the theory , it was later confirmed in several experiments that they actually exist in nature .",
    "they are a manifestation of the fact that composite quantum systems can be entangled , in the sense that they are not exclusively separable .    nowadays",
    ", it is widely known that quantum entanglement enables numerous applications ranging from quantum cryptography to quantum computing .",
    "although the theory of entanglement has been extensively studied within recent decades ( for recent reviews consult refs .",
    "@xcite ) , it is still an evolving research field with many open problems .",
    "one of these problems concerns the reliable and efficient detection of entanglement in experiments @xcite .",
    "while for bipartite two - level systems it is possible to experimentally verify the presence of entanglement by making a few joint local measurements , the number of measurements needed for entanglement detection generally scales rather disadvantageously with the size of the system .",
    "the main challenge for high - dimensional multipartite systems is not only to develop mathematical tools for entanglement detection , but to find schemes whose experimental implementation requires minimal effort . in other words ,",
    "the aim is to verify entanglement with as few measurements as possible , specifically without resorting to full state tomography .",
    "another fundamental concept of quantum theory is complementarity , which states that there exist observables that can not be measured simultaneously . in the mathematical formalism",
    ", complementarity expresses itself through the fact that there are pairs of observables for which no common eigenbasis can be found .",
    "consequently , if two observables are complementary then it is impossible to prepare a system such that the outcome of both is predictable with certainty .",
    "the extreme case of complementarity is when the eigenbases of two observables form a pair of mutually unbiased bases ( mubs ) @xcite .",
    "this is when all ( normalized ) eigenvectors of one observable have the same overlap with all eigenvectors of the other observable .",
    "thus , if a system is in an eigenstate of a particular basis , then the measurement result in a corresponding mutually unbiased basis is completely random .",
    "the question of how many mubs exist for a given hilbert space has been a lively topic of research ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "although it is been known since @xmath0 @xcite that for @xmath1 the number of mubs is at most @xmath2 and that such a _ complete set _ of mubs exists whenever @xmath3 is a prime power , the maximal number of mubs remains open for all other dimensions .",
    "even for the smallest non - prime power dimension @xmath4 , the existence of a complete set remains an open problem and current numerical @xcite and analytical @xcite evidence suggests that it is likely that there is none .",
    "it is currently unclear if the ( non-)existence of a complete set of mubs in non - prime - power dimensions has fundamental reasons or consequences .",
    "however , one should also look at mubs from a pragmatic perspective ; or as phrased by bengtsson @xcite : `` ... the real mub problem is not how many mubs we can find . the real mub problem is to find out what we can do with those that exist . ''",
    "existing applications of mubs are quantum state tomography @xcite , cryptographic protocols @xcite and the mean king s problem @xcite . in short , they are generally useful for finding and hiding ( quantum ) information .    in this paper , we present a new application of mutually unbiased bases .",
    "namely , we link the concept of mubs with the separability problem .",
    "we show that one can exploit the properties of mubs to derive powerful entanglement detection criteria for arbitrarily high - dimensional systems .",
    "these criteria are well suited for the experimental verification of entanglement as they are experimentally accessible through measuring correlations between only a few local observables .",
    "in contrast to a full state tomography where the experimental effort can grow exponentially with the system size @xcite , our approach enables optimal entanglement detection using a number of measurement settings which scales only linearly with the dimensionality of the local subsystems . in fact",
    ", we also show that even two local mub settings , in general , suffice for a comparably robust entanglement test .",
    "furthermore , by considering the noise thresholds of our criteria we find an interesting theoretical connection between the separability of density matrices and the maximum number of mubs .",
    "in particular , we provide an alternative proof that there can not be more than @xmath2 mubs in any dimension .",
    "we also consider extensions of our methodology for continuous variables and multipartite systems .",
    "these are discussed by the example of the two - mode squeezed state and the aharonov state .",
    "a set of orthonormal bases @xmath5 for a hilbert space @xmath6 where @xmath7 is called mutually unbiased ( mu ) iff @xmath8 holds for all basis vectors @xmath9 and @xmath10 that belong to different bases , i.e. @xmath11",
    ". if two bases are mutually unbiased , their corresponding observables are complementary  a measurement of one of these observables reveals no information about the outcome of the other .    in dimension @xmath12 , a set of three mutually unbiased bases is readily obtained from the eigenvectors of the three pauli matrices @xmath13 and @xmath14 : @xmath15 these three bases constitute a complete set since it is impossible to find an additional basis that is mutually unbiased to all of them .    in general , for prime - power dimensions",
    "@xmath16 , there are several explicit methods to construct a complete set of @xmath2 mubs making use of finite fields @xcite , the heisenberg - weyl group @xcite , generalized angular momentum operators @xcite and identities from number theory @xcite . for the special cases @xmath17 and @xmath18 , it was shown that such sets can be constructed in a rather simple and experimentally accessible way @xcite .",
    "the concept of mutually unbiased bases can also be extended to continuous variable ( cv ) systems @xcite . here",
    ", the bases given by the ( generalized ) eigenstates of position and momentum operators provide a well known example of mubs . if one allows the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ mu condition ] ) to vary between each pair of bases , a continuum of mubs is available @xcite . requiring that all pairwise overlaps have the same modulus leads to a symmetric set of three mubs for cv systems @xcite .",
    "first , in order to relate mubs with the separability problem , let us specify how correlations can be quantified . consider a bipartite system where measurements on each of the two subsystems @xmath19 and @xmath20 have @xmath3 different outcomes @xmath21 . if we can predict with certainty the outcome of a measurement on @xmath19 when we know the outcome of a measurement on @xmath20 ( or vice versa ) we call a system fully correlated .",
    "on the other hand , we call a system completely uncorrelated if the outcome of a measurement of one party tells us nothing about the other party , i.e. when the outcomes are completely random . following this notion",
    ", it is possible to construct a correlation function for any two observables @xmath22 on @xmath23 .",
    "we denote the joint probability that the outcome of @xmath24 is @xmath25 and the outcome of @xmath26 is @xmath27 by @xmath28 .",
    "we define the correlation function @xmath29 which we call the _ mutual predictability_. it can be used to quantify the probability of predicting the measurement results of @xmath24 knowing the outcome of @xmath26 and vice versa .",
    "namely , if the observables @xmath24 and @xmath26 are fully correlated then the outcomes @xmath30 can always be labeled in a way such that @xmath31 .",
    "it is noteworthy that labels in general have no physical meaning .",
    "thus , it is up to us what outcome we declare as @xmath32 .",
    "however , the point is that when the observables @xmath24 and @xmath26 are completely uncorrelated we obtain @xmath33 no matter what labeling we choose .    in the quantum case ,",
    "each observable @xmath22 corresponds to an orthonormal basis @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "here we have @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the state of the system , and thus the mutual predictability reads .",
    "again , one obtains @xmath31 for fully correlated states when @xmath34 and @xmath35 are chosen appropriately with respect to @xmath37 , and @xmath33 for completely uncorrelated states , independent of the chosen bases .",
    "for a particular state @xmath37 and measurement settings @xmath22 the quantity @xmath38 tells us nothing about the separability of a state .",
    "for instance , we can have @xmath31 for all entangled pure states @xmath39 which directly follows from the schmidt decomposition .",
    "any entangled state may be written in the form @xmath40 with @xmath41 using the orthonormal schmidt bases @xmath42 and @xmath43 . using observables @xmath24 and @xmath26 that correspond to these bases , we obviously obtain @xmath31 .",
    "however , we also obtain @xmath31 for a classically correlated separable state @xmath44 as it yields the same joint probabilities @xmath45 when we use @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "hence , to detect entanglement , the mutual predictability @xmath38 has to be measured in at least two bases , @xmath22 and @xmath46 .",
    "let us consider a pure product state which we write as @xmath47 in an arbitrary basis @xmath48 . for @xmath49",
    "one obtains @xmath50 if both parties use the basis @xmath48 .",
    "however , in a second basis @xmath51 which is mutually unbiased to @xmath48 , the mutual predictability @xmath52 is completely lost : since @xmath48 and @xmath51 are mutually unbiased we have that @xmath53 and consequently @xmath54 .    inspired by this result ,",
    "let us consider the quantity @xmath55 .",
    "as shown , with a pure product state we obviously can attain @xmath56 for a pair of mubs .",
    "similarly , we can achieve @xmath57 for a product state using @xmath58 mutually unbiased bases @xmath59 and corresponding terms @xmath60 ; because when the mutual predictability equals @xmath61 in one basis then it is @xmath62 with respect to the other @xmath63 bases .",
    "the main result of this paper is that these values are upper bounds for separable states , i.e. for all separable states and any set of @xmath58 mutually unbiased bases for @xmath19 and @xmath20 it holds that @xmath64 in particular , for a complete set of mubs we have @xmath65    for an arbitrary pure product state @xmath66 we have @xmath67 here , the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means @xmath68{x_1",
    "\\cdot x_2 \\cdots x_n}$ ] for positive numbers implies that @xmath69 now we can exploit that for any pure state @xmath70 and @xmath58 mutually unbiased bases it holds that @xmath71 which was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite as a generalization of the result established in ref .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ amgm ] ) together with eq .",
    "( [ mstatement ] ) prove the validity of ( [ maincriterion ] ) for all pure product states . finally , since @xmath72 is linear in the density matrix @xmath37 it follows that ( [ maincriterion ] ) holds for all ( mixed ) separable states as pure states represent extreme points .",
    "the quantities @xmath72 together with the corresponding bounds for separable states can serve as criteria for entanglement detection in mixed states . however , what about the detection strength ?",
    "let us consider the @xmath3-dimensional isotropic states @xmath73 with @xmath74 .",
    "these are known to be entangled for @xmath75 and separable for @xmath76 @xcite . for an arbitrary basis choice @xmath77 in system @xmath19 and @xmath78 in @xmath20 the mutual predictability is always @xmath79 since @xmath80 is @xmath81 invariant @xcite .",
    "thus , using @xmath58 mutually unbiased bases @xmath82 for @xmath19 and @xmath83 for @xmath20 we attain @xmath84 which violates ( [ maincriterion ] ) for @xmath85 .",
    "consequently , entanglement allows for values @xmath86 which can be considered as an exact quantification of the statement that quantum correlations are more resistant against changes of the basis than ordinary correlations in separable states .",
    "as we also see the noise robustness of the criteria ( [ maincriterion ] ) increases with the number of mubs ( see figure  [ isobound ] ) . if there exists a complete set of @xmath87 mubs the criterion ( [ maxcriterion ] ) is necessary and sufficient for the separability of @xmath80 as @xmath88 is the exact bound of separability .    ) for the @xmath3-dimensional isotropic states @xmath73 in dependence on the number of mutually unbiased bases @xmath58 .",
    "the detection strength improves with increasing @xmath58 until for @xmath87 all entangled states are detected.,width=302 ]    the significance of these results is manifold : first , the criteria ( [ maincriterion ] ) are surprisingly powerful .",
    "each isotropic state is local - unitarily equivalent to any other maximally entangled state mixed with white noise @xcite . by incorporating the corresponding local basis transformation that brings such a state into the isotropic form we can detect all entanglement when @xmath3 is of prime power dimension .",
    "remarkably , only two mubs are needed for detecting entanglement up to a threshold of @xmath89 noise . in comparison ,",
    "bell inequalities are often used as indicators of entanglement as they are simple to realize in experiments @xcite . however , using two measurement settings for each party they merely reach a maximal noise threshold between @xmath90 and @xmath91 depending on the dimension @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "notably , two mubs suffice to verify all entangled pure states in arbitrary dimension as is proven in appendix [ sufficiency ] . moreover , regarding experimental verification of entanglement , we are now in the position that we can customize the number of mubs depending on what is experimentally feasible .",
    "second , we emphasize that with the presented concept we establish a direct link between the separability boundary and the maximum number of mubs ( illustrated in figure  [ isobound ] ) .",
    "notice that if there were @xmath92 mubs for a hilbert space @xmath93 , then we would have @xmath86 for separable states , namely for isotropic states @xmath80 with @xmath94 .",
    "this , however , is not compatible with the statement of eq .",
    "( [ maincriterion ] ) , and thus we have shown by contradiction that there can not exist more than @xmath2 mubs .",
    "last , it should be noted that our criteria are adaptable for arbitrary mixed states , i.e. for verifying entanglement in density matrices beyond the white noise scenario . in general ,",
    "if one applies our criteria to an arbitrary unclassified state @xmath37 one can improve the detection by maximizing the outcome of @xmath72 over local - unitaries ( by seeking the optimal transformation @xmath95 ) and permuting the order of the basis vectors in the mutually unbiased bases .",
    "appropriate tools for this optimization can be found in refs .",
    "an analysis of a broader class of states which is related to a geometric structure of the hilbert - schmidt space is given in appendix [ geometry ] .",
    "the concepts introduced in the previous section are not limited to discrete systems but can easily be applied to continuous variable ( cv ) states . as the noise robustness of the criteria ( [ maincriterion ] ) increases with the number of mubs , it is to expected that we can find quite strong entanglement detection criteria for cv systems since in this case there exist infinitely many mubs @xcite . from a theoretical point of view",
    "it would certainly be interesting to study the generalization of our concept for a continuum of mubs .",
    "however , in the current paper we take the viewpoint of an pragmatic experimentalist who has access to only a limited number of complementary observables .",
    "let us study the simplest case where one has access to only two mutually unbiased bases corresponding to position @xmath96 and momentum @xmath97 measurements of single particles .",
    "consider the two - mode squeezed state wave function @xcite @xmath98 \\",
    ", \\nonumber \\\\ & \\psi_s(p_1,p_2)=\\\\ & \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi } } \\exp[-e^{-2r}(p_1-p_2)^2/2-e^{+2r}(p_1+p_2)^2/2 ] \\ , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] depending on the squeezing parameter @xmath99 , whose entanglement we would like to verify in an experiment by measuring joint probabilities .",
    "we use the mutual predictabilities @xmath100 of correlated positions @xmath101 and @xmath102 of anti - correlated momenta @xmath103 even though the correlations are measured quite imprecisely by dividing the state space into only two regions for each particle and observable ( which can be regarded as a detector with very low resolution that produces only two distinguishable outcomes , equivalent to @xmath12 ) this suffices to detect almost all entanglement in a squeezed state : via the minimal realization of our approach , i.e. @xmath104 for separable states , we detect entanglement if the squeezing parameter is @xmath105 .",
    "this is already very close to the exact solution @xmath106 @xcite .",
    "recall that this is done only by measuring correlations between positions @xmath107 and momenta @xmath108 , that is without full knowledge of the state .",
    "note that , if experimentally possible , we are always allowed to add further mubs and use a finer partitioning of the hilbert space ( in accordance with the detector resolution ) to improve the detection strength . however , in several cases few ( or even only two ) mubs are enough to experimentally verify the presence of entanglement .",
    "it is characteristic for multipartite systems that entanglement can occur in various ways . here",
    ", it can happen that some parts of the system are entangled , while at the same time , others are separable @xcite .",
    "for this reason , the concept of @xmath109-separability has been introduced : a pure state @xmath110 of an @xmath111-partite system is called @xmath109-separable if it can be written as a tensor product of @xmath109 vectors , i.e. @xmath112 . states that are @xmath111-separable do not contain any entanglement and are called _ fully separable_. of special interest are quantum states whose entanglement ranges over all @xmath111 parties . those are termed _ genuine multipartite entangled states _",
    "@xcite and can not be factorized at all , that is when @xmath113 .",
    "the generalization to mixed states is straightforward : a mixed state @xmath37 is called @xmath109-separable if all pure state decompositions @xmath114 require at least one @xmath115 which is at least @xmath109-separable according to the above definition .    while for pure states it is straightforward to examine if a state is genuine multipartite entangled , it is demanding to answer this question for mixed states .",
    "the main problem here is that standard entanglement criteria which are applicable to bipartite systems generally fail for the verification of genuine multipartite entanglement .",
    "this is due to the fact that biseparable states ( @xmath116 ) can be entangled with respect to all bipartitions when they are mixed rather than pure : a typical example is a state of the form @xmath117 .",
    "although this state is not genuine tripartite entangled , it might not be separable with respect to any fixed bipartition of the system .    along with the fact that there currently exist only few criteria for the detection of genuine multipartite entanglement in mixed states",
    "( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) comes another problem to deal with .",
    "namely , most of the currently known criteria are not scalable , that is in most cases the number of needed measurement settings grows exponentially with the number of parties .",
    "this is generally a serious obstacle to experimental implementations . in this section ,",
    "we show that genuine multipartite entanglement can also be verified using few mubs by adopting the previously introduced concept to the multi - particle scenario .     of the criteria ( [ gmecriterion ] ) for the n - partite aharonov state in the presence of white noise , i.e. @xmath118 . for @xmath119 the state @xmath120 is detected to be genuine multipartite entangled .",
    "the detection strength increases with the number of used mutually unbiased bases @xmath58.,width=302 ]    let us discuss our approach by the example of an @xmath111-partite @xmath111-dimensional singlet state @xcite , known as the _ aharonov state _ @xcite @xmath121 where @xmath122 denotes the generalized levi - civita symbol .",
    "for example , for three qutrits it reads @xmath123 the aharonov state has two central properties .",
    "first , from a correlation point of view , it is completely anti - correlated .",
    "this implies that if one performs measurements on @xmath124 parties and is aware of all outcomes then one can predict with certainty the outcome of the remaining party . furthermore , this state is @xmath125 invariant implying that these anti - correlations always hold when all of the @xmath111 parties choose the same local basis @xcite . with respect to the mentioned symmetries of the state",
    ", it is reasonable to introduce an @xmath111-particle anti - correlation function @xmath126 which is @xmath127 iff all local measurement outcomes of the observables @xmath128 are always unequal .",
    "specifically , @xmath127 for the aharonov state when @xmath129 , i.e. when the same basis is chosen for all subsystems ( as explained above ) .",
    "we build the linear combination @xmath130 using @xmath58 mutually unbiased bases .",
    "this quantity @xmath131 is bounded by @xmath132 for biseparable states .",
    "suppose we have a pure state @xmath133 which is biseparable with respect to any bipartition @xmath134 .",
    "in general , such a state can reach @xmath127 for a certain choice of observables @xmath135 .",
    "however , if we replace the local bases @xmath128 by corresponding mutually unbiased bases @xmath136 then the predictability is lost , similarly to the bipartite qudit case ( sec .",
    "[ biqudits ] ) .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath137 where @xmath138 and @xmath139 are the dimensions of @xmath140 and @xmath141 . since @xmath142 is the minimum dimension over all bipartitions of the @xmath111-partite @xmath111-dimensional system it is guaranteed that @xmath143 holds for all biseparable states . consequently , with @xmath58 mubs we arrive at ( [ gmecriterion ] ) , and since @xmath131 is linear in the density matrix @xmath37 it follows that any violation directly implies the existence of genuine multipartite entanglement in a ( mixed ) state .",
    "let us discuss the detection strength of the criteria ( [ gmecriterion ] ) by the example of the aharonov state in the presence of white noise @xmath118 .",
    "for the pure aharonov state @xmath144 we have @xmath145 for all @xmath24 , and for white noise @xmath146 we have @xmath147 .",
    "thus , in total we obtain @xmath148 which for @xmath149 leads to a violation of @xmath150 .",
    "figure  [ aharonovfig ] illustrates the noise robustness of the criteria ( [ gmecriterion ] ) in dependence on the number of used mutually unbiased bases @xmath58 .",
    "as can be seen therein , while the concept used is rather simple , the derived criterion is remarkably powerful in detecting genuine multipartite entanglement in the vicinity of the aharonov state . for protocols where this particular state is used as a resource",
    "( e.g.  @xcite ) this could be exploited to test whether the state was correctly distributed between all parties .",
    "note that there currently exists no comparable test for verifying genuine multipartite entanglement in @xmath120 and that the actual noise threshold is unknown .",
    "note furthermore that it is to be presumed that our concept can easily be adopted to other multipartite states by taking into account their symmetries and correlations . in many cases",
    "this should lead to criteria with a valuable experimental - effort - to - detection - strength - ratio .",
    "in conclusion we have established a connection between mutually unbiased bases and entanglement detection .",
    "we showed that mubs allow for an intuitive way of constructing entanglement criteria for arbitrarily high - dimensional systems .",
    "these criteria are beneficial for experiments since they require only a few local measurements . by means of the isotropic and bell - diagonal states ( appendix  [ geometry ] ) we demonstrated that our approach can yield necessary and sufficient criteria for separability if a complete set of mubs is available for the local subsystems .",
    "in addition , we found that the number of mubs can be related to the separability problem and provided an alternative proof that for a @xmath3-dimensional system there can not exist more than @xmath2 mubs .",
    "besides optimal detection through complete sets of mubs we showed that even using only two local complementary measurement settings it is possible to verify entanglement with a quite adequate robustness to noise . for experiments where",
    "the set of measurable observables is limited this may be of valuable help .",
    "for instance , for systems in high - energy physics investigated at accelerator facilities only a restricted observable space is available due to the laborious effort and technical limitations . however , e.g. for neutral entangled @xmath151-mesons  @xcite one could realize two mubs during the time evolution of the system allowing for a direct test of entanglement via the introduced criteria .",
    "two mubs are also sufficient for detecting all entangled pure states of any two - qudit system ( appendix  [ sufficiency ] ) and allow for powerful entanglement detection in continuous variables .",
    "even the presence of genuine multipartite entanglement can be tested very effectively through correlations in mubs , which we demonstrated by the example of the aharonov state .    for prime power dimensions ,",
    "mubs enable a complete state tomography .",
    "consequently , local information and correlations with respect to mubs should provide necessary and sufficient information to detect all entanglement in systems which are composed of subsystems with prime power dimensionality .",
    "for such systems , it should be possible to develop a general framework of entanglement detection based on complementary observables .",
    "for qubit systems , such a framework should be equivalent to the concept of correlation tensors ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) , as the decomposition of density matrices in terms of pauli matrices is intrinsically linked to mubs .",
    "however , a generalization of correlation tensors to higher - dimensional systems has so far been addressed only by means of the generators of the special unitary group @xcite . here , a theory in terms of mubs should allow for an alternative method to investigate multilevel quantum correlations which is expected to be experimentally advantageous .",
    "the presented scheme might also yield new results on systems with non - prime power dimensions : just as we have shown that an upper bound on the number of mubs can be deduced from the separability problem via the isotropic states , it might also be possible to determine the actual number of mubs using a certain state and/or system . finally , as numerous quantum features such as discord @xcite , steering @xcite and nonlocality ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) give rise to particular correlations , it is conceivable that they can also be brought into relation with mutually unbiased bases , or even be directly formulated in terms of them .",
