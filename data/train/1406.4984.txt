    "<S> we introduce a microscopic computation which shows that the hamiltonian of a bose - einstein condensate can be analytically solved in the two - mode approximation , in particular , in the case of an asymmetric double - well condensate in the dilute regime . </S>",
    "<S> our model is exactly diagonalisable when the overlap of the quasilocalized modes in each well is small enough with respect to the trap asymmetry . for larger overlaps or highly symmetric traps , our diagonalisable hamiltonian acquires extra terms that we treat within perturbation theory .    </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian of a two - mode bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) has been extensively studied in the literature @xcite due to its relative simplicity and application to double - well @xcite or spin-@xmath0 @xcite condensates .    in spite </S>",
    "<S> that the two - mode bec corresponds to the most simple multi - mode situation , canonical models employed , such as the bose - hubbard hamiltonian @xcite , can not be solved analytically . therefore , common techniques to study this system involve numerical methods , approximations ( such as the use of bethe ansatz ) and semiclassical analysis ( mean - field theory ) where the modes are treated classically . </S>",
    "<S> however some of the authors of this paper have introduced a model which hamiltonian can be diagonalized analytically @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the model is a generalization of the bose - hubbard hamiltonian which includes mode - exchange and coherent tunneling interactions previously ignored or neglected . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , physical effects produced by such interactions have been experimentally observed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since our model involves certain constraints among the different terms of the hamiltonian , the question of to what extent it describes a realistic bec remains open . </S>",
    "<S> this is the question that we address here .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we show that the exactly solvable model of the two - mode bec introduced in @xcite can be derived from the microscopical description of a double - well bec . </S>",
    "<S> showing this simply involves a generalization of the modes commonly employed in the two - mode approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the microscopic calculation we carry out here yields directly the diagonalizable model plus extra - terms that can be treated perturbatively as long as the overlap between the quasi localised modes in each well is much smaller than the trap asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we find that this is indeed the case in a wide variety of experiments involving double - well becs . </S>",
    "<S> the behaviour of the diagonalizable model under generic perturbations has already been studied in @xcite . exploiting these results we compute the relevant corrections of the eigenstates within perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we provide a complete toolbox for the analytical description of a wide range of double - well becs , which includes not only the ground state of the system but all the eigenvalues and eigenvectors .    . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 , @xmath2 are almost - localised modes with a small overlap characterised by @xmath3 ( see the text ) . in the bose - hubbard model , </S>",
    "<S> the two - mode approximation considers two equally balanced superpositions of @xmath1 and @xmath4 . here </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a more general superposition ( see eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : lmodes ] ) which allows to treat the hamiltonian analytically , as long as @xmath5 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> let us discuss our results in more detail . </S>",
    "<S> we start with the microscopic description of a bec . </S>",
    "<S> consider the many - body energy functional for bosonic particles of mass @xmath6 trapped in a potential @xmath7 undergoing two - body collisions with s - wave scattering length @xmath8 : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the coupling strength and @xmath11 is the hamiltonian of the trap . </S>",
    "<S> the wavefunction @xmath12 can be expanded in terms of the eigenfunctions @xmath13 of the total hamiltonian @xmath14 and their corresponding annhilation operators @xmath15 as @xmath16 at absolute zero temperature and in the absence of particle collisions , all particles occupy the ground level of the single - particle hamiltonian @xmath17 producing a bec . in this case , the ground - state wavefunction @xmath18 is symmetric . however , in the case that particles collide with interaction energy small compared to the single - particle energy , we can consider that particles occupy the two lowest eigenstates of the hamiltonian , i.e the antisymmetric mode @xmath19 is also populated . in this case , a two - mode approximation is valid and the total wavefunction of the system is well described by @xmath20 the real wavefunctions @xmath21 and @xmath22 are orthonormal modes @xmath23 with @xmath24 which have a small transition amplitude such that @xmath25 typically , the modes in terms of the symmetric and antisymmetric solutions are written as , @xmath26 by substituting the two - mode approximation eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : almostmodes ] ) in the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) we obtain , @xmath27 where @xmath28    the hamiltonian eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hamiltonian])describes a constant number of particles @xmath29 where @xmath30 of them occupy mode @xmath31 with corresponding energy @xmath32 . the number of particles in each mode change with probability amplitude @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to this , particles undergo same - mode collisions with scattering lengths @xmath34 and @xmath35 , elastic collisions between particles in different modes @xmath36 and mode - exchange collisions @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath36 . while the latter terms are usually neglected , their effects </S>",
    "<S> have been observed in the laboratory @xcite and they have been extensively discussed theoretically @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now focus in double - well becs and distinguish two cases of interest , namely symmetric and asymmetric potentials . </S>",
    "<S> we label the symmetric and antisymmetric solutions of the single particle hamiltonian corresponding to the symmetric well as @xmath39 and @xmath40 the solutions in the asymmetric potential . therefore </S>",
    "<S> , in the case of the symmetric potential the two - mode approximation corresponds to two almost - localized modes @xmath41 in the literature of double - well becs @xcite , these modes are commonly labeled @xmath42 to emphasize that they are almost localized modes in well a and b respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we will use this notation here as well .    in the asymmetric potential case </S>",
    "<S> , we can write the modes @xmath43 and @xmath44 in terms of the symmetric quasilocalized modes , @xmath45 it is easy to see that in terms of the symmetric and antisymmetric solutions of the symmetric potential we obtain @xmath46 where @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> note that we recover the symmetric case when @xmath48 .    </S>",
    "<S> we have introduced the set of quasilocalized modes because the integrals in the hamiltonian are easily evaluated in the @xmath1 and @xmath4 basis . </S>",
    "<S> they are nearly normalized modes with @xmath49 , @xmath50 , where the amplitude of transition between them @xmath51 is assumed to be very small . therefore , all the fourth - order integrals containing both modes , such as : @xmath52 are of order @xmath53 .    relaxing the notation , </S>",
    "<S> the modes of the asymmetric potential are related with the quasilocalized modes by the transformation : @xmath54    note that for the case @xmath48 , the two - mode approximation becomes @xmath55 which yields a hamiltonian which describe two non - interacting well - localised modes , @xmath56 with @xmath57 in this case the modes @xmath1 and @xmath4 become orthonormal . </S>",
    "<S> another case of interest is that of @xmath58 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the two - mode approximation commonly used in the literature for a symmetric double well potential which leads to the well known hubbard - bose hamiltonian after neglecting the terms corresponding to mode - exchange collisions @xmath59 , @xmath37 , @xmath60 and @xmath36 .    here </S>",
    "<S> we consider a more general mode decomposition parametrized by the angle @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> however , this simple change has strong consequences . </S>",
    "<S> after evaluating the integrals in this new set of modes and adding the constant @xmath62 we obtain the hamiltonian , @xmath63 where @xmath64 is diagonalizable : @xcite @xmath65 and @xmath66 , @xmath67 are of order @xmath68 , @xmath53 respectively . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath69 and @xmath70 for @xmath71 assuming that the scattering length of particles in each mode is equal . </S>",
    "<S> close attention must be taken in evaluating @xmath72 and @xmath73 since the wavefunctions must be renormalized before the integration is carried out . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath64 describes a bec in an asymmetric double - well potential . @xmath74 and @xmath75 correspond to the number of particles in each well . </S>",
    "<S> the wave functions @xmath21 and @xmath22 overlap giving rise to tunneling of particles through the potential barrier . </S>",
    "<S> particles undergo on - site collisions @xmath76 and in the overlapping region of the wavefuntions particles of different wells can collide @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> two other interesting effects are present in the hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> one of them in coherent tunneling in which two particles collide and tunnel as a single particle @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> these effects has already been observed in laboratory . </S>",
    "<S> a less known effect is collision assisted tunneling in which a particle tunnels thanks to energy gained during a on - site collision @xmath79 .    </S>",
    "<S> the eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath64 are @xmath80 note also that the two - mode approximation requires that on - site interactions are much stronger than the interactions between particles in different wells . </S>",
    "<S> this is possible if we restrict ourselves to small values of @xmath61 such that @xmath81    let us consider the term @xmath66 , @xmath82 where we have already assumed the approximation in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : theta ] ) .    by comparing eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : lapartediag ] ) and ( [ eq : firstorder ] ) , we see that we can treat @xmath66 as a perturbation , as long as @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> this is indeed the case in a wide variety of experiments involving double - well condensates @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the tunnelling rate @xmath84 takes experimental values ranging from @xmath85 @xcite to @xmath86 @xcite , while the energy offset between the wells can be as high @xmath87 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> even if the wells are intended to be perfectly symmetric , the uncertainty in the trap depth leads us to assume a minimum trap asymmetry of @xmath88 @xcite .    using the results in @xcite , we find the following non - vanishing matrix elements in perturbation theory : @xmath89 now let us discuss the term @xmath67 , which includes all the fourth - order integrals containing both modes : @xmath90 where the @xmath53 integrals @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 are defined in eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : ints ] . </S>",
    "<S> the leading contributions to the non - vanishing matrix elements of the perturbation are : @xmath94 the behaviour of several physical quantities of interest in a model described by a hamiltonian @xmath64 under generic perturbations with the same mathematical structure as @xmath95 and @xmath67 was thoroughly discussed in @xcite .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce a toolbox for the analytical description of a two - mode bec . </S>",
    "<S> our results are found by means of a generalisation of the modes commonly used in the two - mode approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the bose - hubbard model corresponds to a particular case of the modes we introduce here . </S>",
    "<S> an important advantage of our scheme is that it includes mode - exchange and coherent tunnelling interaction terms that have been observed experimentally and are typically neglected . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , while the bose - hubbard hamiltonian is commonly solved numerically , our model can be fully treated with analytical methods . </S>",
    "<S> we not only find the ground state but the full spectrum and the eigenstates . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that this will be of great benefit for quantum information and metrology application with bec setups . as a first example of interest </S>",
    "<S> , our discussion has been focused on the asymmetric double - well bec . </S>",
    "<S> however , the theory we have here developed can be applied to a more general situation since the only assumptions we have made are that the condensate wavefunction can be approximated by two modes and that the transition amplitude between them is very small . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , a case of interest is a single - well bose - einstein condensate consisting of atoms in two hyperfine levels @xcite . in such case , </S>",
    "<S> mode - exchange collisions have been predicted by microscopic calculations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the exactly solvable model can be generalized to the multi - mode case ( including optical lattices ) and many - body interactions . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore of great interest to explore as well the microscopic derivation of those cases . </S>"
