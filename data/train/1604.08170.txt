    "an important step in the follow - up observing program of nasa s _ kepler _ mission ( borucki et al .",
    "2010 ) is the acquisition of reconnaissance spectra of kepler objects of interest ( koi ) , i.e. stars hosting transiting planet candidates .",
    "these spectra allow a more detailed characterization of the potential planet - hosting star . for most kois",
    "only photometrically derived properties from the kepler input catalog ( kic ) are known prior to reconnaissance spectroscopy .",
    "kic uncertainities for dwarf stars between 4500 and 6500  k are @xmath3  k and 0.4  dex in log  @xmath1 and somewhat larger for more evolved stars ( brown et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "stellar radii are often estimated by comparing a star s effective temperature and surface gravity to evolutionary tracks .",
    "however , the kic does not offer tight constraints on log  @xmath1 ( 0.4  dex at best ) .",
    "spectroscopic surface gravity values are often more precise and can yield tighter constraints on stellar radii . this in turn impacts the planetary radius derived from the modeling of the transit feature in the _ kepler _ light curve .",
    "a large number of different tools have been developed in order to determine fundamental stellar parameters from observed spectra .",
    "the success of these tools depends strongly on the nature of the spectra .",
    "some techniques work best on high signal / noise ( s / n ) data and break down for noisy data .",
    "others work well on high resolution spectra , but fail when line - blending becomes significant in low - resolution data .",
    "thus , one must carefully match the technique to the type of spectra that will be obtained .",
    "one class of techniques starts with a model stellar atmosphere and computes the emergent spectrum , given the atomic ( or molecular ) parameters ( wavelength , excitation potential , @xmath4 , damping constants , etc . ) of the spectral features .",
    "the current `` gold - standard '' in model atmosphere analysis of stellar spectra are self - consistent 3-d radiation - hydrodynamics simulations ( e.g. stein & nordlund  1998 , asplund et al .  2000 , magic et al .",
    "these models succeed quite well in reproducing the details of stellar line profile shapes . however , this level of detail really demands spectra of comparable quality , with very high spectral resolution and s / n .",
    "a widely used `` workhorse '' alternative is the moog stellar atmospheric analysis code ( sneden  1973 ) .",
    "moog performs a variety of spectral line analysis and spectrum synthesis tasks under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) in a 1-d stellar atmospheric model .",
    "with moog , one can either measure equivalent widths of individual stellar atmospheric lines of interest and compare those with model widths , or one can synthesize regions of stellar spectra for comparison with the observed spectrum .",
    "a third alternative is `` spectroscopy made easy '' , or sme ( valenti & piskunov  1996 ) , which also synthesizes a stellar spectrum under the assumption of lte in a 1-d stellar atmospheric model .",
    "one can then optimize the stellar model parameters ( t@xmath5 , log  @xmath1 and [ fe / h ] ) by minimizing the @xmath6 difference between the observed and the synthesized sme spectra .",
    "this can be a very effective and efficient method for deriving uniform and self - consistent stellar parameters for large samples of spectra ( e.g. valenti & fischer  2005 ) .",
    "all three of these techniques work best on spectra of relatively high s / n and high spectral resolution .",
    "the analysis of lower s / n spectra requires special approaches in order to achieve useful and self - consistent results .",
    "when the spectra are sufficiently noisy that individual stellar absorption lines can not be measured reliably , then one must adopt a technique that will treat large sections of the spectrum together .",
    "the most successful of these methods involve some form of spectral matching , where the observed spectrum is compared to a library of spectra , and a comparison algorithm determines the `` best '' match to the observations . in some cases ,",
    "the library is a set of observed spectra with carefully and self - consistently determined stellar properties , as in the specmatch code used by petigura , marcy , & howard  ( 2013 ) . for this to work well",
    ", the library of observed spectra must be obtained with the same instrument as the target spectrum , they must all be of high signal / noise , and they need to cover the parameter space of t@xmath5 , log  @xmath1 and [ fe / h ] rather uniformly . a viable alternative to this technique",
    "is use a library of synthetic model spectra , rather than observed spectra .",
    "this ensures that the relevant ranges of parameter space are well covered , and that all of the library spectra are completely self - consistent and noise - free .",
    "however , one must model the spectrograph instrumental function in order to compare an observed spectrum with the library spectra .",
    "this approach of synthetic spectra has been used by buchhave et al .",
    "( 2012 ) to perform a uniform analysis of relatively low signal / noise spectra from different spectrographs .",
    "a new version of specmatch now uses a grid of synthetic models ( petigura et al .",
    "2015 , in preparation ) .    in this paper",
    ", we present _ kea _ , a code that we developed at mcdonald observatory to compare high - resolution , low s / n spectra of koi stars to a massive grid of synthetic stellar spectral models in order to determine the fundamental stellar parameters of the _ kepler _ target stars .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : section 2 describes the our spectroscopic observations and data reduction . in section 3 , we detail how we created a grid of synthetic spectra using the moog spectrum synthesizer . in section 4 , we describes the calibration of _ kea _ using 100 well - characterized stars from the _ kepler _ stellar properties catalog ( huber et al .",
    "2014 , = h14 hereafter ) , the so - called `` platinum '' star sample .",
    "finally , in section 5 we present a comparison of _ kea _ results from our mcdonald observatory reconnaissance spectra with stellar parameters derived from higher s / n keck / hires spectra of the same koi .",
    "we use the tull coud spectrograph ( tull et al .  1995 ) at the harlan j. smith 2.7 m telescope at mcdonald observatory to obtain the reconnaissance spectra .",
    "we observe with a 1.2-arcsecond slit , which yields a spectral resolving power of @xmath7 .",
    "the complete visual spectrum ( 3750  10200 ) is imaged on a 2k@xmath82k ccd detector .",
    "after flat - fielding , bias - subtraction and order extraction , using standard iraf routines , we divide each order by the appropriate blaze - function .",
    "we determine the shape for the blaze - function for each night using high - s / n flat field lamp exposures .",
    "this division removes the large - scale curvature due to the blaze .",
    "we then apply an additional correction to each order to remove any residual curvature in the continuum .",
    "the uncertainty of each pixel @xmath9 in the extracted spectrum is calculated as : @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the total number of detected photo - electrons in a pixel , @xmath12 is the number of pixels in a column that were combined during order extraction , and @xmath13 is the readout noise . for the tull spectra we use @xmath14 and @xmath15  electrons .    finally , we flux - normalize the spectral orders to unity , scaling the pixel uncertainties accordingly .",
    "figure[fig1 ] shows an example of one order of a typical koi reconnaissance spectrum before and after these preparatory steps .",
    "we computed a large grid of model stellar spectra using the ` synth ' mode of the lte stellar spectral line analysis and spectrum synthesis moog .",
    "we used the kurucz  ( 1993 ) stellar atmosphere grid , with the `` odfnew '' opacity distribution function .",
    "spectra were synthesized from 3450 to 7000 .",
    "the complete spectral grid covers a range of @xmath0 from 3500  k to 7000  k in 100  k steps , and from 7000  k to 10,000  k in steps of 200  k. we used [ fe / h ] to represent overal stellar metallicity .",
    "model spectra were computed with [ fe / h ] ranging from -1.0 to + 0.5dex in 0.25dex steps .",
    "all models used a solar value of [ @xmath16/fe ] .",
    "stellar surface gravity was varied from 1.0 to 4.0 in steps of 0.5dex and from 4.0 to 5.0 in steps of 0.25dex .",
    "no spectra were computed with @xmath17 for @xmath0 from 9200  k to 10,000  k nor for @xmath18 for @xmath0 from 8400  k to 10,000  k as those regions of parameter space were not covered by the kurucz  ( 1993 ) model atmospheres .",
    "the final grid comprises a total of 8752 synthetic spectra .",
    "we obtained atomic line parameters ( @xmath4 , excitation potential , and damping parameters ) from vald ( vienna atomic line database , kupka et al .",
    "we included molecular opacities for mgh ( bernath et al .",
    "1985 , hinkle et al .  2013 ) , tio ( plez , 1998 ) , and cn ( sneden et al .  2014 ) .",
    "the mgh line list included @xmath19mgh lines in the a @xmath20@xmath21-x @xmath20@xmath22@xmath23 system listed by bernath et al .",
    "( 1985 ) , supplemented by @xmath24mgh and @xmath25mgh lines from the compillation of hinkle et al .",
    "( 2013 ) . for cn , we limited our consideration to @xmath26c@xmath27n lines in the a  @xmath20@xmath21-x @xmath20@xmath22@xmath23 ( red ) and b  @xmath20@xmath22@xmath23-x @xmath20@xmath22@xmath23 ( violet ) systems .",
    "both of these linelists are available from the moog labdata web pagechris / lab.html ] .",
    "the tio line list included only the @xmath28ti@xmath29o isotopologue .",
    "in all , our final line list included approximately 3.3 million spectral lines .",
    "for each synthetic spectrum calculation , we employed the moog `` weedout '' feature to remove atomic and molecular lines from the linelist with a ratio of line to continuum opacity of less than 0.001 .",
    "a separate line list of `` strong '' spectral lines was used so that the extended damping wings of h  balmer lines , and certain lines of na , mg , ca , cr , mn and fe could be computed fully .",
    "before _ kea _ can match the synthetic spectra to the observed spectral orders , the synthetic spectra need to be convolved with the appropriate point - spread - function ( psf ) to assure the same spectral resolution of model and data .",
    "for this purpose , we convolve the synthetic spectrum with a gaussian - shaped psf and down - sample the model to set it on the same pixel scale as the observation . for each order",
    "we calculate the correct width of the psf for an @xmath30 spectrum with 2048 model pixels .",
    "in addition to this psf - convolution , _ kea _ also applies a standard rotational broadening function for stellar lines as derived in gray  ( 2005 ) .",
    "the rotational broadening will likely also absorb any residual psf broadening for spectra where the resolution is slightly different to @xmath30 .",
    "we did not include macroturbulence as a line broadening effect .",
    "we think that the inclusion of macroturbulence as an additional model parameter is not warranted , given the typically moderate to low s / n values of the spectra that _ kea _ is applied to .",
    "the rotational broadening will likely absorb any macroturbulence effects and might therefore be slightly overestimated . after these steps , the model spectrum is ready to be compared to the data . _",
    "kea _ is using the standard @xmath31 criterion for the goodness - of - fit test .    in the next step",
    "we determine the wavelength shift @xmath32 between the model and the observation .",
    "this @xmath32 is caused by the combination of the absolute radial velocity of the target star and the earth s motion at the time of observation .",
    "for this purpose we use one spectral order and shift a default model with no rotational broadening and solar @xmath0 , [ fe / h ] and log  @xmath1 until a @xmath31-minimum is found that corresponds to the @xmath32 between model and data .",
    "we apply the @xmath32 that corresponds to the @xmath31-minimum to all _ kea _ model orders for this particular spectrum . in some cases , particularly for very low",
    "s / n data , one order is not enough to determine the @xmath32 shift . under these circumstances we typically use 4 to 5 different spectral orders to find the correct @xmath32 .    to save computational time , _ kea _ does not compare the entire grid of synthetic spectra to every single observed spectral order .",
    "we adopted a two - step approach :    \\1 .",
    "_ kea _ is run using a coarse step size in all four parameters spanning the entire range of the synthetic grid . from 3500  k to 7000  k @xmath0 we use a step of 500  k in @xmath0 and from 7000  k to 10,000  k a step of 1000  k , for [ fe / h ] we use the four values of -1.0,-0.5,0.0 , and + 0.5 , and for log  @xmath1 we use the values 1.0 , 2.0 , 3.0 , 4.0 , 4.5,and 5.0 . for @xmath2 in the range from 1 to 15kms@xmath33 we move in steps of 2kms@xmath33 and then from 20 to 60kms@xmath33 in steps of 10kms@xmath33 . for each spectral order ,",
    "_ kea _ determines the @xmath31-value and records the best - fit model for each order .",
    "the final parameters and uncertainties that _ kea _ reports for a spectrum are the mean values of the model parameters of all best - fit models and the formal uncertainty of this mean ( = rms/@xmath34 with @xmath35 the number of orders used to determine the mean ) .",
    "this initial run yields a first `` guess '' set of stellar parameters that we use as input parameters for step 2 . in case of a fast rotator with @xmath36kms@xmath33 the best - fit models for",
    "all orders will have the maximum value of 60kms@xmath33 .",
    "for these targets we expand the range of trial @xmath2 values even further .    \\2 . in the second step ,",
    "we run _ kea _ using the densest possible step size that is set by the model grid itself : @xmath0 in 100  k , [ fe / h ] and log  @xmath1 in 0.25 dex steps , and @xmath2 in 1kms@xmath33 steps ( except for fast rotators where we use steps of 5 - 10kms@xmath33 ) .",
    "in contrast to the previous step we now limit the range that _ kea _ searches in the model grid to @xmath0 values that are @xmath37  k , @xmath38dex in log  @xmath1 and @xmath39kms@xmath33 in @xmath2 from the first - guess values from step 1 using the whole range of [ fe / h ] values in our library . as before , we record the best - fit ( @xmath31-minimum ) models for each spectral order that _ kea _ analyzes and determine the final stellar parameters from the mean and scatter of these values .",
    "figure[fig3 ] shows 12 spectral orders from one observed koi spectrum ( blue ) and the corresponding best - fit _",
    "kea _ model in green and the residuals in red .",
    "to test _ kea _ we used the so - called `` platinum '' star sample of the _ kepler _ follow - up observing program .",
    "the platinum stars are a carefully selected group of stars from the _ kepler _ stellar properties catalog ( h14 ) that all have asteroseismically derived log  @xmath1 values with very small uncertainties of the order of @xmath40 dex . during the 2014 _ kepler _ observing season we collected spectra for 100 platinum stars , using the exact same instrumental setup as for the koi observations .",
    "the stars range in @xmath0 from 5000 to 6700  k , in [ fe / h ] from -1.0 to + 0.5 and in log  @xmath1 from 3.3 to 4.6 dex .",
    "the majority of the sample are slow rotators with only 12 stars having a @xmath41kms@xmath33",
    ". out of these 12 only 5 stars have @xmath42kms@xmath33 .",
    "a detailed description of the selection criteria of the platinum sample and a comparison of different methods to derive stellar parameters will be presented in a future publication ( furlan et al .",
    "2016 , in prep . )",
    "the platinum stars are also significantly brighter than the kois we observe at mcdonald observatory , which reflects in a much higher s / n for the platinum star spectra .",
    "typically , a koi reconnaissance spectrum has a s / n of 20 - 30 per resolution element at 5650  , while the platinum star spectra have s / n@xmath43",
    ".    we used _",
    "kea _ to derive stellar parameters from these 100 spectra .",
    "we compared the overall mean offset and rms - scatter of the 100 _ kea _ values with the published values for each of the 21 orders of the tull spectrum that covers the wavelength range of our library .",
    "table[tab1 ] contains the complete information of this order by order comparison and the result is displayed in figure[orders ] .",
    "we calibrateb _ kea _ by testing which spectral orders yield the smallest offsets from , and smallest scatter around , the reported values in h14 . with this procedure",
    "we identify spectral orders that are sensitive to the stellar parameter that we want to determine .",
    "we achieved best results by using 13 ( out of these 21 ) spectral orders which satisfy the following criteria : the mean offset in @xmath0 is less than 110  k and the overall scatter of the values is less than 200k , the offset in [ fe / h ] is less then 0.1  dex and the rms is less than 0.2  dex , and for log  @xmath1 we selected orders that have an offset of less than 0.1  dex and an rms less than 0.3  dex .",
    "the resulting selection of orders are displayed in figure[orders ] with a ( green ) shaded background .",
    "all 13 orders are being used to measure the @xmath2 .    for @xmath0 and [ fe / h ] we can perform this calibration only for a subset of 63 stars that also have spectroscopically derived [ fe / h ] and @xmath0 listed in h14 ( the remaining 36 stars have these values estimated from photometry and [ fe / h ] set to a default value of @xmath44 ) .",
    "the uncertainties in @xmath0 for these 63 stars is @xmath45  k. the uncertainties for the spectroscopically derived [ fe / h ] values in h14 are given as 0.15  dex .",
    "our calibration yield in effective temperature a small offset of -25  k with an rms - scatter of 89  k. for the metallicity we achieved an offset of -0.02 dex and an rms of 0.07 dex . for surface gravity",
    "we can use all 100 stars and compare it to the asteroseismically derived log  @xmath1 values .",
    "the _ kea _",
    "results show a small offset of -0.0006 dex , smaller than the h14 uncertainties , and an rms - scatter of 0.11  dex .    in figure[huber4 ]",
    "we display the dependence of the difference between the _ kea _ results and the values from h14 on the value of this parameter .",
    "we do not see any strong systematic trends in these differences .",
    "after the calibration with the high s / n platinum star spectra , we tested _ kea _ on data in the s / n range that is typical for our _ kepler _ mission reconnaissance observations .",
    "we compared the _ kea _",
    "results for 45 reconnaissance spectra of 32 kois from the beginning of the mission ( all with koi numbers @xmath46 ) with the results derived from keck / hires spectra .",
    "the keck data were analyzed with sme and we took the stellar parameters that are posted in the notes section of each koi on the cfop webpage . in a few cases , we took the stellar parameters from the published literature : e.g. koi-87 : borucki et al .",
    "( 2012 ) ; koi-128 : endl et al .",
    "( 2012 ) ; koi-135 , koi-183 and koi-214 : endl et al .",
    "the s / n of the 45 tull reconnaissance spectra at 5650  ranges from 13 to 133 per resolution element , with a mean of 28 and a standard deviation of 19 .",
    "the effective temperature range of these data is 4700 to 6100  k , in [ fe / h ] from -0.55 to + 0.45 and in log @xmath1 from 3.9 to 4.7  dex .",
    "we display the results in figure[keck1 ] .",
    "in effective temperature we find an average offset of + 80 k and an rms - scatter of 100 k. the _ kea _ @xmath0 values are systematically higher than the sme values , especially in the 5200 to 5600 k range . for the metallicity parameter",
    "we see an offset of-0.04 dex and a standard deviation of 0.12 dex . and for the surface gravity we find a very small offset of + 0.002 dex with an rms - scatter of 0.18 dex between the keck results and ours .",
    "table[tab2 ] lists the sme and _ kea _ values from this test along with the koi number and the s / n of the tull spectra ( we do not have access to the s / n values of the hires spectra ) .",
    "the slightly larger offset in @xmath0 and the increased scatter of these results , as compared to the platinum star sample calibration , might be due to the lower s / n of the tull spectra .",
    "we tested this hypothesis by artifically degrading the s / n of the platinum star spectra .",
    "we used a subset of 30 spectra that originally have @xmath47 , @xmath48[fe / h ] = @xmath49  dex and @xmath48  log  @xmath50  dex .",
    "degrading these spectra to s / n=30 yielded the following values : @xmath51 , @xmath48[fe / h ] = @xmath52  dex and @xmath48  log  @xmath53  dex .",
    "decreasing the s / n further down to s / n=20 we obtained @xmath54 , @xmath48[fe / h ] = @xmath55  dex and @xmath48  log  @xmath56  dex .",
    "these results indicate that a major contribution to the larger offsets and rms - scatter for the sme-_kea _ comparison is simply lower s / n .",
    "owing to the specific calibration of _ kea _ we note that results for stars with effective temperatures outside the range of the platinum sample ( 5000 - 6700  k ) might have larger uncertainties than the ones quoted here . also , _",
    "kea _ is not tested for rapid rotators with @xmath42kms@xmath33 .",
    "finally , our results indicate that stellar parameters derived with _ kea _ from spectra with",
    "s / n less than 20 are unreliable .",
    "we present a description of the new _ kea _ spectroscopic fitting tool , which we use to derive stellar parameters ( @xmath0 , [ fe / h ] , log  @xmath1 and @xmath57 ) for the _ kepler _ mission reconnaissance spectra that we collect with the tull spectrograph at the harlan j. smith 2.7 m telescope at mcdonald observatory .",
    "a calibration with the sample of 100 platinum stars yield typical uncertainties of @xmath58  k in effective temperature , of @xmath59 dex in [ fe / h ] and of @xmath60 dex in log  @xmath1 .",
    "we tested _ kea _ by comparing it to stellar parameters derived from higher s / n keck / hires spectra for 32 kois and 45 tull spectra in the s / n range of our reconnaissance observations .",
