    "in the previous paper[1 ] we have identified the cp violating phases of the seesaw model and found six independent phases . in the case where the heavy right - handed majorana mass has a strong hierarchy in the diagonal basis @xmath0 , the diagonalization of the seesaw matrix is possible under the assumption that the elements in yukawa - dirac mass matrix are rather universal . among six phases ,",
    "three of them are identified as a dirac phase and two majorana phases in the light neutrino sector while the remaining three arise from the mixing of the light neutrinos and heavy neutrinos .",
    "other result is that three phases of the low energy sector in principle can be determined by using neutrino oscillation and double beta decay experiments .",
    "the remaining three appears in the lepton number asymmetry of heavy majorana neutrinos decays . under the assumption",
    ", it was shown the phases in low energy sector and the phases in high energy sector are not related each others and the correlation between cp violation at low energy and cp violation at high energy is rather weak .    in this paper",
    ", we explore more general case . following the arguments given by [ 2 ]",
    ", we assume that the yukawa - dirac mass term is rather hierarchical and their magnitudes are given by up type quark masses . by reducing numbers of independent parameters",
    ", we can study the case that the correlation does exist .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study numerically the correlation between cp violating phases in mns matrix and cp violating phases for baryogenesis through leptogenesis .",
    "the mass lagrangian of the seesaw model has the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 is @xmath3 mass matrix @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 are dirac and majorana mass matrix respectively .",
    "this @xmath2 can be diagonalized by unitary matrix @xmath7 , i.e. , @xmath8 , where @xmath7 is given as  @xmath9 .    in the non - decoupling case [ 1]and by using the mass eigenstate for charged lepton ,",
    "the @xmath10 matrix is the submatrix @xmath11 of @xmath7 itself .",
    "general analysis on this extended @xmath11 mns matrix results in six independent cp phases .",
    "rewriting @xmath12 in the form @xmath13 , @xmath7 in the submatrices k , r , s , t , and the order of s and r as given in[3 ] , then the diagonalization we will obtain a usual relation of the seesaw model @xmath14    further analysis gives the charged current which shows that @xmath15 and @xmath16 give the charged current couplings of charged leptons to the light neutrinos @xmath17 and to the heavy neutrinos @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "in the decoupling limit , @xmath16 can be neglected and only @xmath19 mns matrix @xmath15 is relevant .",
    "we consider the diagonalization of eq.(3 ) , and for calculational purpose we take all six phases of @xmath19 mns matrix appear .",
    "we parameterize @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the unitary matrix and @xmath22 is triangle matrix whose real diagonal elements @xmath23 and complex off - diagonal elements @xmath24 where @xmath25 . to make a connection between mns matrix and lepton number asymmetry we set @xmath26 and suppress six independent parameters . with this working hypothesis , from the low energy neutrino oscillation data",
    ", we can determine the scales of heavy majorana neutrinos and the lepton number asymmetries from their decays .",
    "without loose of generality we take matrix @xmath6 is real diagonal , @xmath27 .",
    "expansion eq.(3 ) in component @xmath28 , we have @xmath29 and @xmath30 where @xmath31 . the eq.(5 ) leads to three constraints for six phases of general unitary mns matrix , hence the mns matrix has only three free phases as we demand . whereas the eq.(6 ) gives relation between the phases in low and high energy sector .    because both @xmath32 and @xmath23 are real then we can easily see that eq.(5 ) gives simple constraints i.e. each denominator of these equations must be real . by using the standard parameterization of the ckm matrix [ 4 ] , we parameterize the mns matrix @xmath15 of the form @xmath33 .",
    "these @xmath15 , @xmath34 and the above constraints yield @xmath35 as function of neutrino masses @xmath36 , mixing angles @xmath37 and cp phases @xmath38",
    ". these @xmath39 are not independent phases and can be absorbed by charged lepton fields , and only dirac phase @xmath40 and majorana phases @xmath41 are independent phases .",
    "next , the reality condition of @xmath6 will give @xmath42 and therefore , it is possible to estimate their values using the neutrino data on neutrino masses , mixing angles and some assumption on the lightest @xmath43 and diagonal elements @xmath23 . for numerical calculation , we will set @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    to determine the correlation between the phases in high energy sector live in @xmath24 and the phases in low energy sector i.e , @xmath40 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 we factor out the phases from @xmath24 as @xmath48 .",
    "this factorization and taking into account the reality of @xmath49 as well as the previous constraints also give the simple constraints i.e. multiplication @xmath50 to each numerator of @xmath24 in eq.(6 ) must be real .",
    "take the values of neutrino masses @xmath51 , and @xmath52 and mid values of mixing angles [ 5 ] with all phases are zero @xmath53 [ 32 ]    c    these values are combined with @xmath54 after substituting them into eq.(5 ) , we get the masses of right - handed neutrino , @xmath55 an example of correlation between cp phases in low energy sector ( @xmath40 ) and cp phases for leptogenesis ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) is shown in figure 1 .",
    "we change @xmath40 from @xmath59 to @xmath60 .    using the above results we evaluate the lepton number asymmetry coming from the decay of massive right - handed majorana neutrino @xmath61 into charged leptons @xmath62 and higgs fields @xmath63 @xmath64 ^ 2 \\nonumber \\\\ & { \\times}&\\left[{\\mbox}{i}\\left ( { \\frac}{{m_k}^2}{{m_i}^2}\\right)+{\\frac}{{m_i}^2}{{m_i}^2-{m_k}^2}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 . the dependence of asymmetry on low cp phases can be obtained , and the dependence on dirac phase @xmath40 is given by figure 2 . from this figure",
    ", we can see the order of asymmetry from @xmath66 is @xmath67 , and the asymmetry of the heavier ones are larger .",
    "in the present paper , we study the correlation between cp violation at low energy and at high energy . under the working hypothesis on the dirac mass term of neutrino sector , we can determine cp violating phases which are related to baryogenesis through leptogenesis from the three cp violating phases in mns matrix , the neutrinos mixing angles and their mass differences . the correlation between the lepton number asymmetry and the cp violating phases in mns matrix",
    "is numerically studied .",
    "we estimate the masses and the decay widths of three heavy majorana neutrinos .",
    "these are sufficient for prediction of the baryon number asymmetry .",
