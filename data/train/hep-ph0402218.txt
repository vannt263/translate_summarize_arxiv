    "the design of the atlas and cms experiments at the lhc was guided by the requirement to have high sensitivity for discovering the higgs boson within the full mass range between 100 gev and approximately 1 tev @xcite .    in recent years",
    "a large effort has gone into accurate calculations of many higgs signal and background cross sections , which in most cases are now known to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) accuracy @xcite . for the dominant standard model ( sm )",
    "higgs production mechanism , gluon  gluon fusion , and as far as the total cross section is concerned , even next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) @xcite qcd corrections have been computed approximation . ] .",
    "by contrast , and despite the recent considerable progress in improving monte carlo ( mc ) event generators , a complete mc program where the same higher - order qcd corrections are included does not exist yet .",
    "qcd corrections to signal and background cross sections are thus either ignored or taken into account in a very naive approach .",
    "normally , results obtained with a standard mc program are simply scaled with the so - called inclusive @xmath4-factor .",
    "although the @xmath4-factor  should not be considered as a physical quantity , this approach is believed to provide a reasonable simulation environment , which allows us to study the acceptance for many signatures . in the context of higgs searches ,",
    "an example is the decay of higgs bosons into four leptons , @xmath7 .",
    "this signature is not really sensitive to additional jet activities , and it is usually assumed that the search sensitivity depends mainly on signal and background cross sections , the particular detector model and the used selection criteria .",
    "consequently , a simple scaling of signal and background with the inclusive @xmath4-factor , according to the most accurate theoretical prediction , should give reasonable results .",
    "this assumption has recently been confirmed in a more quantitative study for the decay @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "however , the situation is different if , in addition to some particle identification , the event kinematics has to be exploited to separate the signal from backgrounds .",
    "a typical example is the proposed higgs search in the mass range @xmath8@xmath2  @xcite , where the identification of the decay @xmath9 requires a jet veto in order to remove @xmath10 events .",
    "in addition , other cuts are required , which exploit the spin correlations between the w bosons and the resulting transverse momentum ( p_@xmath11 ) spectra of the charged leptons .",
    "these cuts are particularly sensitive when the higgs mass is close to 2@xmath12 and if the higgs boson is produced with small transverse momentum p_^@xmath13  .",
    "consequently , we can not expect that the inclusive @xmath4-factors can be used directly and a more careful investigation is needed .",
    "the effects of a jet veto on the @xmath4-factor  have been studied in qcd perturbation theory up to nnlo in ref .",
    "these results show that the impact of higher - order qcd corrections is reduced if a jet veto is applied .",
    "this study demonstrated clearly that the simple @xmath4-factor  scaling can not be used in this case .",
    "it is therefore important to determine the effective `` experimental '' @xmath4-factor   in combination with a detailed simulation of cuts , for both signal and background .    in this paper",
    "we reconsider the @xmath14 channel by using a reweighting procedure of events generated with the pythia @xcite mc program .",
    "the reweighting is performed according to the most up - to - date theoretical predictions for p_@xmath11  spectra of the higgs @xcite and the non - resonant ww production , which is the most important background .",
    "this method allows us to include higher - order qcd corrections in combination with experimental selection criteria to a good approximation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ defkfacs ]",
    "the reweighting technique is introduced . in section [ selection ]",
    "we use pythia to determine the detection efficiency as a function of p_^@xmath13 , using selection criteria based on the ideas given in @xcite .",
    "these selection criteria are relatively robust and it can be expected that only minor modifications are needed in more accurate detector simulations .",
    "next , the p_^@xmath13  spectrum is reweighted so as to agree with the spectrum obtained in ref .  @xcite .",
    "a similar procedure is applied to the main background , the non - resonant ww production ( sect .",
    "4 ) . finally , in sect .",
    "5 , the effective experimental @xmath4-factor  is calculated for the signal and the background and the possible statistical signal significance is obtained .",
    "generally speaking , the number of events for a given integrated luminosity and a particular process , as computed at nlo , is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is called the inclusive @xmath4-factor , which is thus defined as the ratio of the inclusive ( total ) nlo and lo cross sections . at lo , the produced particle ( system ) x ( we have in mind x = h , ww , @xmath17 ) has no transverse momentum , while in ( n)nlo additional jets lead to a non - vanishing p_@xmath11  spectrum .",
    "suppose that a jet veto is applied .",
    "depending on the jet - detection capabilities of the hypothetical experiment one can define an effective parton - level @xmath4-factor from the ratio of accepted events at ( n)nlo and at lo ( for this example all lo events would be accepted ) .",
    "this effective theoretical ( parton - level ) @xmath4-factor is in general smaller than the inclusive @xmath4-factor @xcite .",
    "the definition of effective experimental @xmath4-factors is different and somewhat more complicated , because most experimental simulations are based on lo cross sections , supplemented with parton showering through the standard mc programs .",
    "thanks to additional ( mostly soft ) jets , an approximate p_@xmath11  spectrum of the particular final state is generated .",
    "however , this spectrum is at best an approximation , since only soft and collinear radiation from the primary parton subprocess can be generated correctly .",
    "on the other hand , if the ( n)nlo calculation has been performed differentially as a function of a kinematical variable @xmath18 , the above equation can then be rewritten as @xmath19 where the integral goes over the complete possible range of @xmath18 , and the @xmath18-dependent @xmath4-factor  is defined as @xmath20    in our case pythia is employed as a leading - order mc program ( mc - lo ) .",
    "it is now possible to study the effects of selection cuts that depend on @xmath18 . in this paper",
    "we will be concerned with the case @xmath21 , p_@xmath11  being the transverse momentum of the higgs boson ( signal ) or of the ww pair ( background ) .",
    "the efficiency can be calculated as a function of p_@xmath11  using the pythia program .",
    "after all cuts are applied we can also define an inclusive average efficiency to detect process x. the total number of accepted events within pythia concides with the sum of the events that were accepted differentially over the entire p_^@xmath13  spectrum .    however , if the p_@xmath11-dependent @xmath4-factor defined in eq .",
    "( [ kfactor ] ) is applied to correct ( reweight ) the spectrum , the total number of accepted events can only be obtained from the sum of the differentially accepted weighted events .",
    "this new number of accepted events at ( n)nlo can now be compared with the one accepted in the unweighted pythia simulation and their ratio defines the effective experimental @xmath4-factor  @xmath22 .",
    "the  mc program is used for the simulation of the signal and the different types of relevant backgrounds . the strategy to separate signal events of the type @xmath23 from the various backgrounds is based on the ideas described in ref .",
    "the signal selection proceeds in two steps .",
    "first , events that contain exactly two isolated and oppositely charged high - p_@xmath11  leptons ( electrons or muons ) are selected .",
    "these leptons originate mainly from the decays of w bosons",
    ". they should not be back - to - back in the plane transverse to the beam and their invariant mass should be considerably smaller than the z mass .",
    "furthermore , a substantial missing transverse momentum is required .",
    "essentially , these criteria select only events that contain a pair of w s , these being either signal events or backgrounds from non - resonant ww production @xmath24 , from @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "following this preselection , the criteria for the second step further separate the higgs signal events from backgrounds using : ( 1 ) the somewhat shorter rapidity plateau for signal events , ( 2 ) the jet activity in signal events reduced with respect to the background from @xmath10 production , ( 3 ) the effects of spin correlations and the mass of the resonant and non - resonant ww system , resulting in a small opening angle for the lepton  lepton system and a somewhat mass - dependent characteristic p_@xmath11  spectrum of the charged leptons .    in detail the following cuts are applied :    1 .",
    "the event should contain two leptons , electrons or muons , with opposite charge , each with a minimal p_@xmath11  of 20  and a pseudorapidity @xmath27 smaller than 2 .",
    "2 .   in order to have isolated leptons",
    ", it is required that the transverse energy sum from detectable particles ( defined as `` stable '' charged or neutral particles with a p_@xmath11  larger than 1 ) , found inside a cone of @xmath28 around the lepton direction , be smaller than 10% of the lepton energy .",
    "furthermore the invariant mass of all particles within the cone should be smaller than 2 , and at most one additional detectable particle inside a cone of @xmath29 is allowed .",
    "3 .   the dilepton mass , @xmath30 , has to be smaller than 80 .",
    "the missing p_@xmath11  of the event , required to balance the p_@xmath11  vector sum of the two leptons , should be larger than 20 . 5",
    ".   the two leptons should not be back - to - back in the plane transverse to the beam direction .",
    "the opening angle between the two leptons in this plane is required to be smaller than 135@xmath31 .",
    "dilepton events , originating from the decays of w and z bosons , are selected with criteria 1 and 2 .",
    "lepton pairs that originate from the inclusive production of @xmath32 , including z decays to @xmath33 leptons , are mostly removed with criteria 35 .    starting with this initial set of requirements ,",
    "the following criteria exploit the differences between higgs events and the so - called  irreducible \" background from continuum production of @xmath34x events .    1",
    ".   the opening angle @xmath35 between the two charged leptons in the plane transverse to the beam should be smaller than 45@xmath31 and the invariant mass of the lepton pair should be smaller than 35 .",
    "( 10 gev ) might be needed in order to reject badly measured @xmath36 decays .",
    "such a cut would not change the signal efficiency in any significant way . ]",
    "2 .   for jets , which are formed with a cone algorithm ,",
    "a minimum transverse momentum of 20  is required .",
    "events with a jet of p_^@xmath37  larger than a chosen value @xmath38 and a pseudorapidity @xmath39 of less than 4.5 are removed .",
    "3 .   finally , the p_@xmath11  spectrum of the two charged leptons is exploited .",
    "for this , the two leptons are classified according to their p_@xmath11  into p^_@xmath40  and p^_@xmath41 .",
    "it is found that the p^_@xmath41  and p^_@xmath40  distributions show a jacobian - peak like structure for the signal , which also depends on the simulated higgs mass . in the case of a higgs mass close to 165",
    ", p^_@xmath41  should be between 35 and 50 , while the p^_@xmath40  should be larger than 25 . for @xmath42  the p_@xmath11  of the leptons should be larger than 20 , whereas for @xmath43",
    ", the lepton p^_@xmath41  has to be larger than 45  and p^_@xmath40  larger than 25 .",
    "figure [ leadjetpt ] shows the p_^@xmath37  of the hardest ( leading ) reconstructed jet for signal and background events from after applying the cuts 1 to 6 and cut 8 .",
    "the events with no reconstructed jet are equally distributed over the 10 bins between 0 and 20 . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ leadjetpt ] , the particular choice of the cut value for the jet transverse momentum does not seem to be very critical for the observation of a higgs signal , but it needs to be studied in detail if a precision cross section measurement is envisaged , or if the search is to be extended to much lower values of the higgs mass with smaller signal - to - background ratios .",
    ".[165]cross sections obtained with pythia for signal and backgrounds , and expected number of events after applying various cuts , for @xmath44 gev and an integrated luminosity of 5 fb@xmath3 . in all cases the leptonic branching ratios of both w bosons , @xmath45 with @xmath46 are included . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     following this procedure , the next step consists in calculating the luminosity requirements for the observation of a higgs signal with a statistical significance of five standard deviations . in order to calculate the potential statistical significance of a signal it is usually assumed that the background is accurately known . with this assumption and requiring a significance of five standard deviations , the number of signal events @xmath47 has to be equal to 5@xmath48 , @xmath49 being the number of background events .",
    "thus , ignoring systematic uncertainties , the accurate knowledge of the signal cross section is more important than the absolute value for the background .",
    "however , once systematic uncertainties are considered , the accurate knowledge of the background becomes relevant , especially if @xmath50 is smaller than 1 .",
    "in addition , uncertainties from the luminosity and the parton distribution functions , as well as from the experimental efficiency need to be considered in detail .",
    "most of these uncertainties can only be determined accurately once the first lhc data are obtained .",
    "the transverse momentum spectra of the two leptons , p^_@xmath41  and p^_@xmath40 , after the reweighting and with all cuts applied , are shown in fig .",
    "[ leptonspectra ] for @xmath51 gev .",
    "the accepted events for signal and backgrounds for @xmath42 , @xmath52 , @xmath2 gev and the corresponding statistical significance for 5 fb@xmath3 are given in table [ tablenew ] .",
    "we see that signal - to - background ratios between about 1:2 and 2:1 can be obtained in the mass range under consideration . in the case of @xmath44 gev ,",
    "a statistical significance of five standard deviations can already be achieved with an integrated luminosity of about 0.4 fb@xmath3 .    in order not to affect the discovery potential in any significant way , the systematic uncertainties on the background have to be controlled to better than about 1020% .",
    "this may well be achievable knowing that ( 1 ) the shape of various distributions can be calculated with good accuracy , and that ( 2 ) kinematic regions with small signal contributions can be isolated and used to normalize the potential backgrounds with systematic accuracies of perhaps 510% .",
    "we have performed a simulation of the sm higgs boson search at the lhc in the channel @xmath53 .",
    "qcd corrections have been included by using a reweighting procedure , allowing us to combine event rates obtained with  with the most up - to - date theoretical predictions for the transverse momentum spectra for the @xmath54 signal and its main ww background .",
    "the reweighting method has been used to compare the experimental sensitivity to find the higgs estimated with pythia with the one obtained by taking higher - order qcd corrections into account .",
    "in particular , the effect of a jet veto on the weighted and unweighted events has been investigated . using this procedure and a higgs mass of 165 , the effective experimental @xmath4-factoris only about @xmath55 smaller than the inclusive @xmath4-factor . from these results the higgs discovery potential for the channel @xmath23",
    "is found to be significantly increased .",
    "consequently , signals with a statistical significance of five standard deviations should be observable for a sm higgs boson with masses between 140 and 180   after the first few @xmath56 of integrated luminosity .    the reweighting technique proposed in this paper",
    "can be applied to other final states and the results should be particularly accurate for hard scattering processes with little additional jet activity .",
