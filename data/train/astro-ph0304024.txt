    "an observational definition of ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulx ) is those x - ray sources detected coincident with nearby galaxies , that are both located outside the galactic nucleus and display an observed luminosity in excess of @xmath0 .",
    "there has recently been a lot of attention paid to this class of object based on the argument that if they are accretion - powered systems , then in many cases the observed x - ray luminosity exceeds the eddington luminosity for a 10 m@xmath1 black hole .",
    "explanations for this apparent breach of the eddington limit include accretion on to a new class of @xmath2 m@xmath1 _ intermediate - mass _ black hole ( e.g. colbert & mushotzky 1999 ; miller & hamilton 2002 ) , super - eddington radiation from bloated accretion discs in x - ray binaries ( begelman 2002 ) , and anisotropic emission from x - ray binaries ( e.g. king et al .",
    "2001 ; krding , falcke & markoff 2002 ; king 2002 ) .    however , not all ulx are accreting systems . a minority are actually recent supernovae , such as sn 1986j ( bregman & pildis 1992 ) , sn 1979c ( immler , pietsch & aschenbach 1998 ) , sn 1978k ( ryder et al .",
    "1993 ) and sn 1995n ( fox et al .",
    "2000 ) to name but four .",
    "such objects have been observed to reach x - ray luminosities of @xmath3 ( e.g. sn 1988z , fabian & terlevich 1996 ) and are thought to be the result of the supernova exploding into a dense circumstellar environment .",
    "the ulx phase for young supernova remnants can be short , however , with many ( though not all ) showing steep x - ray flux decay curves ( immler & lewin 2002 ) .",
    "reports of much older , evolved supernova remnants with ulx - like fluxes , for instance the `` hypernova '' remnants of m101 ( wang 1999 ) , have since turned out to be mis - identifications of x - ray binaries ( snowden et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "one supernova remnant that appears to have remained unusually x - ray luminous whilst becoming quite evolved is the remnant mf 16 in ngc 6946 ( nomenclature from matonick & fesen 1997 ) .",
    "though the x - ray source was detected in an ipc observation of ngc 6946 ( fabbiano & trinchieri 1987 ) , it was first identified as an extremely x - ray luminous supernova remnant ( l@xmath4 at 5.1 mpc , placing it firmly in the ulx regime ) on the basis of pspc data ( schlegel 1994 ) .",
    "the x - ray data appeared consistent with a young supernova remnant , but optical data revealed the remnant to be evolved , possibly @xmath5 years old ( blair & fesen 1994 ) .",
    "the remnant appears extraordinarily luminous in x - rays , optical line emission and radio continuum emission ( van dyk et al .",
    "1994 ) for a supernova remnant of this age .",
    "subsequent observations revealed mf 16 to have a physical size of @xmath6 pc , and a distinct morphology characterised by three `` loops '' apparent in narrow - band   and [ sii ] images ( blair , fesen & schlegel 2001 ; hereafter bfs01 ) , though an [ oiii ] image suggested a more elliptical structure with a possible young star at the heart of the nebula . in conjunction with optical spectral data ,",
    "bfs01 suggest that the extraordinary luminosity of this remnant is due to the blast wave of a young supernova impacting on the dense shell of an older remnant . and",
    "data were used to investigate the x - ray emission in detail by schlegel , blair & fesen ( 2000 ) , who found the spectral data to fit well to a dual raymond - smith thermal plasma model .",
    "this is consistent with the data if the hot component comes from the interaction zone and the soft component from within the supernova bubble .",
    "an alternate view is offered by dunne , gruendl & chu ( 2000 ) , who propose that the remnant originates in the interaction of a single supernova blast wave with a dense circumstellar nebula ejected from a massive progenitor star .",
    "they suggest that a hard component in the pspc spectral data may orginate in a pulsar wind nebula .",
    "the first of the two observations reported in this letter has been presented by holt et al .",
    "they conclude that the featureless x - ray spectrum of mf 16 excludes the interaction of a blast wave with circumstellar matter , and does not appear to fit to a pulsar wind nebula model either .",
    "they suggest that the x - ray emission may originate in an unusual , if not unique , set of circumstances . here , we re - analyse this data in tandem with a later public observation of ngc 6946 , and demonstrate that the x - ray source associated with mf 16 is in fact a black - hole x - ray binary ( bhxrb ) , explaining the apparent dichotomy of an evolved remnant with a young supernova - like x - ray flux .",
    ".details of the observations . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ stats ]    the x - ray variability was further investigated by deriving short - term lightcurves from both observations .",
    "both lightcurves were extracted in the full 0.3  10 kev range and binned to a temporal resolution equivalent to 25 counts per bin for a constant source count rate , in order to maximise the temporal resolution whilst maintaining a reasonable average signal - to - noise ratio of five per bin .",
    "two simple tests for variability were then applied to these lightcurves .",
    "firstly , a classic standard deviation of the count rate per bin from the mean count rate over the course of the observation was calculated , and then compared to the expected deviation of @xmath7 expected from gaussian counting noise .",
    "secondly , a @xmath8 test was performed against the hypothesis that the source count rate remained constant during the observation .",
    "the results of these tests , including a probability that the data is variable , @xmath9(var ) , shown for the cases where it exceeds 90% , and the binning of the lightcurves are reported in table  [ stats ] .",
    "they show that the full band lightcurve for the 2002 november observation was statistically consistent with a flat count rate .",
    "however , both a large excess in the standard deviation and in the @xmath8 statistic show the 2001 september data to be variable to very high probabilities ( 99.7 and @xmath10 likelihood , repectively ) .",
    "we investigated this variability further by splitting each dataset into two arbitrary energy bands containing approximately the same number of counts , a 0.3  1.1 kev `` soft '' band and a 1.1  10 kev `` hard '' band .",
    "the lightcurves for these bands are shown in figure  [ lcs ] , again binned to the equivalent of an average of 25 counts per bin ( c.f .",
    "table  [ stats ] for actual bin sizes ) .",
    "both the tests on the binned lightcurves show no strong evidence for variability in the soft band .",
    "however , strong evidence for variability is present in the hard band lightcurve in the 2001 september observation ( at over 99.9% likelihood in both tests ) , and may also be present in the 2002 november observation ( @xmath11 likelihood according to the @xmath8 test ) .    in order to provide a separate test of the variability free of any gross photon binning effects we employed a kolmogorov - smirnov test ,",
    "in which we compared the cumulative photon arrival times to the expected cumulative arrival times for a constant - flux source . this provided separate confirmation of the strong variability in the 2001 september hard band data , and possible variability in the 2002 november hard data .",
    "interestingly , it also showed the 2002 november soft data to be variable at very high significance ( @xmath12 ) , which was not picked up by any other test .",
    "an examination of the photon arrival time distribution for the data shows this result is due to a very slight increase in the average soft count rate over the latter stages of the 2002 november observation , when compared to the earlier stages , which the standard deviation and @xmath8 tests were insensitive to .",
    "the actual average count rate change was from @xmath13 count s@xmath14 in the first 18.5 ks to @xmath15 count s@xmath14 in the latter 11.5 ks .",
    "we note this is probably a real change , and is certainly not due to a change in the background count rate for the source , which remains at @xmath16 count s@xmath14 in the soft band throughout the observation .",
    "our statistical tests , and the amplitude of the variability shown by figure  [ lcs ] , demonstrate that the majority of the hard x - ray emission of ngc 6946 x-11 is varying at least on the timescale of the binning size we use to maximise our statistics , @xmath17 s. the hard x - ray emission is therefore originating in a region with a light crossing time of less than six minutes ( @xmath18 km ) .",
    "this is consistent with a compact accretion - driven x - ray source such as an x - ray binary , and not with a spatially - extended supernova remnant .",
    "note , however , that we can not currently exclude the majority of the soft x - ray emission from originating in a more widespread component .",
    "ngc 6946 x-11 is a point - like x - ray source , its x - ray spectrum is well - fit by models used to describe ultraluminous bhxrb , and its hard x - ray emission varies on timescales of less than six minutes .",
    "the simplest interpretation of this evidence is that the extraordinary x - ray luminosity of ngc 6946 x-11 originates in the accretion of matter in a bhxrb system , and not from the interaction of supernova blast waves with circumstellar material , or a pulsar wind nebula , as previously suggested .",
    "of course , we can not exclude some spatial extension in the x - ray source , which the lightcurves tell us would have to be soft x - ray emission .",
    "if we ignore for a moment the unrealistically low column to the mekal plus powerlaw continuum model , the mekal could still describe the hot gas phase of a supernova remnant .",
    "however , the spectral modelling implies that only @xmath19 of the observed flux originates in the mekal component , implying that the contribution to the observed luminosity from a hot plasma is limited to @xmath20 .",
    "if we are dealing with an ultraluminous bhxrb , it appears quite typical for the limited knowledge we have of this exotic class of object .",
    "a similar spectral model has been derived for the few other ulx with reasonable quality x - ray spectral data ( miller et al .",
    "2003 ; krauss et al . 2003 ; kaaret et al .",
    "2003 ) , with the low inner - disc temperatures for the mcdbb component interpreted as possible evidence for the presence of intermediate - mass black holes .",
    "we also note that the dominant powerlaw continuum component has a value very similar to that observed for galactic bhxrbs in the high state ( @xmath21 ; c.f .",
    "ebisawa , titarchuk & chakrabati 1996 ) .",
    "one curious feature we have identified is that the x - ray variability in this ulx is predominantly above 1.1 kev , implying that it is the powerlaw continuum spectral component that is varying , and not the thermal emission from the accretion disc .",
    "this exclusively hard x - ray variability could quite conveniently explain the observed spectral hardening with increased flux seen in many ulx ( e.g. fabbiano et al . 2003 ) . however , the scenario they describe where the hardening is due to a hotter inner accretion disc at higher accretion rates may not be consistent with our observations , due to the short variability timescales and the softness of the thermal disc component in the x - ray spectrum .",
    "the rapid variation of the hard x - rays may instead originate in other physical mechanisms , for instance variations at the base of a jet ( c.f .",
    "georganopoulos , aharanion & kirk 2002 ) , or magnetic reconnection events in the accretion disc corona ( c.f .",
    "reeves et al .",
    "2002 for a discussion of the latter mechanism applied to the quasar pds 456 ) .",
    "now that we have identified the x - ray emission from mf 16 with a bhxrb , where does this leave the physical models for the extreme radio and optical luminosity of the supernova remnant ? it may be possible that the radio emission could originate from the bhxrb in a relativistically - beamed jet , similar to that reported for an ulx in ngc 5408 by kaaret et al .",
    "it is also quite possible that the optical line emission may be a result of the presence of the bhxrb ; we note that nebulae have been reported to be present at or around the positions of several ulx by pakull & mirioni ( 2003a , b ) .",
    "some of these nebulae are present as giant ( @xmath22 pc ) bubbles encircling the ulx position ; they may be supernova remnants related to the birth of the ulx , as could be the case around ic 342 x-1 ( see also roberts et al .",
    "2003 ) , or may be inflated by the winds from young stars or relativistic jets from the bhxrb .",
    "other nebulae , such as that present near the holmberg ii ulx , shows signs of x - ray ionization .",
    "we note that two of the key diagnostics of x - ray ionization , the presence of a he ii @xmath23 emission line ( c.f .",
    "pakull & angebault 1986 ) and an abnormally high [ oiii]/h@xmath24 ratio ( remillard , rappaport & macri 1995 ) are present in the optical spectrum of mf 16 presented by bfs01 .",
    "the similarity between mf16 and other ulx nebulae is noted by pakull & mirioni ( 2003b ) ; we suggest here that at least some of the extraordinary optical emission - line luminosity of mf 16 may originate in x - ray excitation .",
    "furthermore , we speculate that the nebula itself may be a young precursor of the giant bubbles seen by pakull & mirioni ( 2003a , b ) around other ulx systems . further studies of mf 16 in this context would be of great interest .",
    "finally , we note that the images of mf 16 suggest the presence of a young stellar object at the centre of the nebula .",
    "young stars or stellar clusters have been discovered coincident with at least two other ulx ( goad et al .",
    "2002 ; liu et al .",
    "2002 ) , hence it is possible that this object may be the optical counterpart of the bhxrb itself .      the authors the referee , eric schlegel , for his useful comments that helped to improve this paper .",
    "we also thank andy ptak for assisting us in the use of xassist .",
