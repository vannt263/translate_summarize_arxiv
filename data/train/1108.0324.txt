    "the excited baryon analysis center ( ebac ) at jefferson lab was established in the spring of 2006 for investigating the nucleon resonances ( @xmath0 ) . in this contribution , we report on the development , results , and prospect of ebac .",
    "the ebac project has three components , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ebac - strategy ] .",
    "the first task is to perform a dynamical coupled - channels analysis of the _ world _ data of @xmath1 to determine the meson - baryon partial - wave amplitudes .",
    "the second step is to develop a procedure to extract the @xmath0 parameters from the determined partial - wave amplitudes .",
    "the third step is to investigate the interpretations of the extracted @xmath0 properties in terms of the available hadron models and lattice qcd .",
    "the ebac analysis is based on a hamiltonian formulation  @xcite within which the reaction amplitudes @xmath2 in each partial - wave are calculated from the following coupled - channels integral equations , @xmath3 where @xmath4 , and @xmath5 which has @xmath6 resonant components , @xmath7 are meson - exchange interactions deduced from phenomenological lagrangian , @xmath8 describes the excitation of the nucleon to a bare @xmath0 state with a mass @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is a meson - baryon propagator .",
    "the ebac - dcc model , defined by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cct ] ) and  ( [ eq : ccv ] ) , satisfies two- and three - body unitarity conditions which are the most essential theoretical requirements .",
    "compared with the approaches based on k - matrix or dispersion - relations , the ebac - dcc approach has one distinct feature that the analysis can provide information on reaction mechanisms for interpreting the extracted nucleon resonances in terms of the coupling of the bare @xmath0 states with the meson clouds generated by the meson - exchange interaction @xmath7 .",
    "in order to determine the parameters associated with the strong - interactions parts of @xmath11 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ccv ] ) , the ebac - dcc model was first applied to fit the @xmath12 elastic scattering up to invariant mass @xmath13 gev . for simplicity ,",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 channels were not included during this developing stage .",
    "the electromagnetic parts of @xmath11 were then determined by fitting the data of @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the resulting 5-channels model was then tested by comparing the predicted @xmath18 production cross sections with the data . in parallel to analyzing the data , a procedure to analytically continue eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cct ] ) and  ( [ eq : ccv ] ) to the complex energy plane was developed to extract the positions an residues of nucleon resonances .    in the following , we present the sample results from these efforts .      in fitting the @xmath12 elastic scattering",
    ", we found that one or two bare @xmath0 states were needed in each partial wave .",
    "the coupling strengths of the @xmath19 vertex interactions @xmath20 with @xmath21 were then determined in the @xmath22-fits to the data .",
    "our results were given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our next step was to determine the bare @xmath23 interaction @xmath24 by fitting the @xmath25 and @xmath26 data .",
    "we found  @xcite that we were able to fit the data only up to invariant mass @xmath27 gev , mainly because we did not adjust any parameter which was already fixed in the fits to @xmath12 elastic scattering .",
    "some of our results for total cross sections ( @xmath28 ) , differential cross sections ( @xmath29 , and photon asymmetry ( @xmath30 ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gnpin ] .",
    "the @xmath31-dependence of the @xmath24 vertex functions were then determined  @xcite by fitting the @xmath32 and @xmath33 data up to @xmath27 gev and @xmath34 ( gev / c)@xmath35 .",

    "@xmath39 and @xmath40 . ]      the model constructed from fitting the data of single pion production reactions was then tested by examining the extent to which the @xmath41 and @xmath42 data can be described .",
    "it was found  @xcite that the predicted total cross sections are in excellent agreement with the data in the near threshold @xmath43 gev .",
    "our results for @xmath44 are shown in fig .",

    ", the predicted @xmath41 cross sections can describe to a very large extent the available data , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pnppn ] . here",
    "the important role of the coupled - channel effects were also demonstrated .",
    "however , the predicted @xmath46 cross sections were a factor of about 2 larger than the data while the shapes of two - particles invariant mass distributions could be described very well .",

    "we follow the earlier works , as reviewed and explained in refs .",
    "@xcite , to define that the resonances are the eigenstates of the hamiltonian with only outgoing waves of their decay channels .",
    "one then can show that the nucleon resonance positions are the poles @xmath50 of meson - baryon scattering amplitudes calculated from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cct ] ) and  ( [ eq : ccv ] ) on the unphysical sheets of complex-@xmath51 riemann surface",
    ". the coupling of meson - baryon states with the resonances can be determined by the residues @xmath52 at the pole positions .",

    "solid ( dashed ) curves are their real ( imaginary ) parts.,title=\"fig : \" ]    with our analytic continuation method  @xcite , we were able to analyze the dynamical origins of the nucleon resonances extracted from the ebac - dcc model .",
    "this was done by examining how the resonance positions move as the coupled - channels effects are gradually turned off . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : p11-traj ] for the @xmath53 states , this exercise revealed that the two poles in roper region and the next higher pole are associated with the same bare state .",
    "the extracted residues @xmath52 are complex which is the necessary mathematical consequences of any approach based on a hamiltonian formulation . as an example , the extracted @xmath54 form factors for the three @xmath53 resonances indicated in fig .  [ fig : p11-traj ] are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : p11-ff ] . to complete the ebac project",
    ", we must investigate how these results can be related to the current hadron models and lattice qcd .",
    "during the developing stage of ebac in 2006 - 2010 , the ebac - dcc model parameters were determined by analyzing separately the following data : @xmath55  @xcite , @xmath56  @xcite , @xmath57  @xcite , @xmath58  @xcite , and @xmath42  @xcite .",
    "the very extensive data of @xmath59 and @xmath60 production were not included in the analysis . to have a high precision extraction of nucleon resonances",
    ", it is necessary to perform a _ combined _ simultaneous coupled - channels analysis of all meson production reactions .",
    "the combined analysis must be continued to also fit the @xmath62 data of meson electroproduction data for extracting @xmath23 form factors up to sufficiently high @xmath31 .",
    "in addition , we should explore the interpretations of the extracted resonance parameters in terms of lattice qcd and the available hadron models , such as the dyson - schwinger - equation model and constituent quark model .",
