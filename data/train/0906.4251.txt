    "the concept of dimensions with regard to stochastic processes has been studied in various contexts . for example",
    ", motoo and watanabe  @xcite considered a class @xmath0 of martingale additive functionals of general markov processes , and proved that there exists a basis @xmath1 of @xmath0 such that every element in @xmath0 can be represented as a sum of stochastic integrals based on @xmath1 and a discontinuous part .",
    "this is a broad extension of the study by ventcel  @xcite , where the brownian motion on @xmath2 was considered .",
    "the number of elements constituting the basis is sometimes called the _ martingale dimension _ , which coincides with the usual dimension of the underlying state space in typical cases .",
    "some related arguments are found in the papers by kunita and watanabe  @xcite , cramr  @xcite , and so on .",
    "later , as a variation , davis and varaiya  @xcite introduced the concept of _ multiplicity of filtration _ in a more abstract setting , that is , on filtered probability spaces .    as another variation of these studies , in the first part of this article",
    ", we introduce the concept of _ index _ of regular dirichlet forms @xmath3 using energy measures of functions in @xmath4 .",
    "this definition is purely analytic .",
    "we then prove some of its properties ; among others , we describe the identification of the index with the martingale dimension of the diffusion process associated with @xmath3 when the dirichlet form is strong local .",
    "this fact has been proved by kusuoka  @xcite when the underlying space is a self - similar fractal ( although the original definition of the index is equivalent to but different from that in this article ) .",
    "our result is regarded as a natural generalization of kusuoka s one .    in the latter part of this article",
    ", we focus on the case that the underlying space @xmath5 is a fractal set .",
    "in such a case , it is difficult to obtain an explicit value of the index ( in other words , the martingale dimension ) of canonical dirichlet forms , unlike the case of spaces with differential structures . thus far ,",
    "the only result that has been obtained is that dirichlet forms @xmath3 associated with regular harmonic structures on post - critically finite ( p.c.f . )",
    "self - similar fractals with some extra assumptions have an index of one  ( @xcite ) . as an application of this fact , we prove that every function @xmath6 in @xmath4 has a `` first - order derivative '' almost everywhere with respect to a minimal energy - dominant measure , and the total energy of @xmath6 ( namely , @xmath7 ) is described as the square integral of the derivative .",
    "this representation appears as if the dirichlet form were defined on a one - dimensional object , which can be regarded as a reflection of the property that the index is one . here",
    ", of course , derivatives in the usual sense do not exist since the underlying space @xmath5 does not have a differential structure . instead , we take a good reference function @xmath8 from @xmath4 and define the derivative of @xmath9 as the infinitesimal ratio of the fluctuation of two functions @xmath6 and @xmath8 . from another viewpoint",
    ", we have a taylor expansion of @xmath6 with respect to @xmath8 up to the first order . the concept that the total energy of @xmath6 can be described as a square integral of a type of vector - valued gradient",
    "was first introduced by kusuoka  @xcite ( see also @xcite for a related work ) .",
    "the contribution of this paper is the observation that only one good reference function is sufficient for the study of the infinitesimal behaviour of every function in @xmath4 and almost every point in @xmath5 when the index is one .",
    "recently , pelander and teplyaev  @xcite studied a topic similar to the one addressed in this article and proved the existence of derivatives of a type of smooth function on some self - similar fractals . in their results ,",
    "the existence of the derivative is assured almost everywhere with respect to self - similar measures , while in this paper , the derivative is proved to exist almost everywhere with respect to some energy measures . since self - similar measures and energy measures are mutually singular in many cases  ( @xcite ) , these results are not comparable .    as a general theory ,",
    "a good reference function can be taken from a certain dense subset of @xmath4 .",
    "exactly what function we can take is not obvious .",
    "we will provide a partial answer to this problem ; in the case of non - degenerate generalized sierpinski gaskets , we prove that every nonconstant harmonic function can be taken as a reference function . as a byproduct of this result , the energy measures of arbitrary nonconstant harmonic functions are mutually absolutely continuous .",
    "this fact is new even for the case of a two - dimensional standard sierpinski gasket .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section  2",
    ", we introduce the concept of index of regular dirichlet forms and study its properties . in section  3 , the index is characterized in terms of the martingale dimension when the dirichlet form is strong local . in section  4 ,",
    "we review the theory of self - similar dirichlet forms on p.c.f .  self - similar fractals ; we then discuss the index of such fractals and related topics . in the last section ,",
    "we prove the existence of derivatives of functions on p.c.f .",
    "fractals when the index is one . some properties of sierpinski gaskets are also investigated in detail .",
