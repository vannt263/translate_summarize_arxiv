    "the growth timescale of the synchrotron photon field may explain the delay timescale of the gev onset @xcite .",
    "this possibility was tested by time - dependent simulations in am11 .",
    "they showed that a very low magnetic field ( @xmath61 and @xmath62 cm in their example ) is required to reproduce the gev delay . here , we write the magnetic field @xmath63 the standard synchrotron model attributes the spectral peak energy @xmath33 to the typical photon energy emitted from the lowest - energy electrons at injection . the physical mechanism that determines the minimum - lorentz factor @xmath64 of those electrons is still under discussion . in a low magnetic field as given in eq .",
    "( [ eqb ] ) , to emit synchrotron photons in mev range , a very high minimum - lorentz factor ( @xmath65 ) is required as @xmath66 where we have omitted the cosmological redshift factor . in this case",
    "the typical photon energy in the electron rest frame becomes @xmath67 which largely exceeds @xmath68 , so the klein ",
    "nishina effect is crucial to emit ic photons .",
    "the ic photon production is an inefficient process so that the gev component shows a slow growth compared to synchrotron .",
    "soft photons ( @xmath69 ) that can efficiently interact with electrons of @xmath64 are produced by electrons that have already undergone energy losses and have @xmath70 . however , as soft photons increases , the newly injected electrons cool via mainly ic emission owing to a very low @xmath71 . therefore , the synchrotron component starts decreasing while the ic component grows .",
    "this enhances the difference in the peak times of the mev and gev lightcurves .    for the purposes of comparison with the leptonic calculations in the present paper ,",
    "we summarize here some of the leptonic results in am11 .",
    "the lightcurves in figure 12 in am11 show a gev delay due to the mechanism we mentioned above .",
    "however , the difference in the peak times is within a pulse timescale , @xmath72 ( the difference in the peak times is roughly half of this timescale in the example in am11 ) , and the gev and 100 kev lightcurves converge in the late stages .",
    "the fwhms of the two lightcurves are almost the same .",
    "the example in am11 adopted an ideal set of parameters for the gev delay , and it seems difficult to produce even larger delays by simple ssc models .",
    "we did not find significant gev delays for more conservative ssc parameter sets in our simulations in am11 .",
    "an external inverse compton ( eic ) model @xcite was also tested in am11 .",
    "the mev photons are emitted from a smaller radius , and they are upscattered by non - thermal electrons in an outer region , where some dissipation mechanism , such as internal shocks , inject those electrons . in this model , we require two different origins for the mev and gev components . a gev delay larger than the typical pulse timescale ( @xmath73 )",
    "appears naturally , although the model requires a large number of accelerated electrons , which leads to an energy - budget problem .",
    "if the numbers of electrons and protons are the same , most of the energy carried by the protons remains unreleased .",
    "some grbs , in which the main mev component is hard to explain by the usual synchrotron model , like grb 090902b @xcite , are interesting applications for this model . in the frame of the outer dissipation region ,",
    "the photon field coming from an inner region is highly beamed along the radial direction .",
    "the @xmath74-scattering probability becomes highest for head - on collision so that the scattered ic - photons tend to propagate with a large angle to the radial axis . as a result",
    ", the intensity of the scattered photons becomes anisotropic . in this case",
    ", the emission from off - axis regions ( @xmath75 ) contributes considerably .",
    "am11 showed that the gev lightcurve has a long tail ( see figure 15 in am11 ) , which is a characteristic feature of this model .",
    "as a shell expands , the photon density decreases so that the opacity against @xmath7 absorption also decreases with time .",
    "this effect may cause a gradual increase of the @xmath7 cut - off energy @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we test the evolution of the @xmath7-opacity as a possible mechanism of the gev delay .",
    "when the electron injection timescale is comparable to or shorter than the shell expansion timescale @xmath76 , the opacity evolution tends to cause a negative gev delay : the gev emission is terminated earlier than the mev emission as shown in figure 3 or 8 in am11 .",
    "as the electron injection builds up the photon density , @xmath7-optical depth increases , and gev photons begins to be absorbed .",
    "it was hard to observe the effect of the opacity decrease in our simulations with an injection timescale of @xmath77 .",
    "therefore , here we adopt a very long electron injection to see the opacity decay as the shell expands .",
    "we consider a shell expanding from an initial radius @xmath78 cm with a bulk lorentz factor @xmath79 , and optimize parameters to observe the opacity effects as below .",
    "if we take a standard assumption for the shell width as @xmath80 , the photon escape timescale and shell expansion timescale become comparable . in such a case , the opacity evolution may be softened by residual photons generated earlier but before escape .",
    "so we assume a thin shell @xmath81 .",
    "the electron injection continues until @xmath82 cm ( @xmath83 ) with a constant rate , and its isotropic - equivalent energy for this pulse is @xmath84 erg .",
    "the injection spectrum is assumed as a cut - off power - law shape , @xmath85 for @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is determined by equating the cooling timescale @xmath88 ( synchrotron , ic , and ssa are taken into account ) and the acceleration timescale @xmath89 in this section we assume the electron index @xmath90 , and `` bohm limit '' acceleration as @xmath91 . in order to avoid contamination of other evolutionary effects ,",
    "the magnetic field @xmath92 g , shell width , and minimum injection energy of electrons @xmath93 gev are assumed to be constant during the electron injection .",
    "however , the ratio @xmath71 , which may be approximated as @xmath94 evolves from @xmath95 to @xmath96 during the electron injection .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] shows the spectral evolution in the shell frame .",
    "the spectral peak energy @xmath97 kev arising from the parameter set chosen here is somewhat higher than the usual values .",
    "this is because we are considering a special case similar to grb 080916c , which showed a delayed gev onset with a source - frame peak energy of @xmath98 mev @xcite . in a strict sense , @xmath3 in figure [ fig:1 ]",
    "means that a short time @xmath99 has passed after the electron injection started . at this point ,",
    "the spectrum is not in a steady state for photon production , escape , and @xmath7 absorption . during the initial phase for @xmath100 , the opacity still increases with the photon density . at @xmath101",
    "the high - energy portion of the spectrum can be approximated by a broken power - law with a photon index @xmath102 below the break energy @xmath103 and @xmath104 above that , rather than an exponential cut - off .",
    "this break is similar to the prediction by @xcite , in which a thin slab is considered as a photon source .",
    "however , the mechanism for yielding a broken power - law is different for our one - zone model with a finite shell width . in a quasi steady state , the fraction of photons , whose annihilation timescale @xmath105 is shorter than the escape timescale @xmath106 , may be written as @xmath107 .",
    "then , the spectral shape may be @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the intrinsic spectrum , whose density is determined by the balance between continuous photon production and escape / volume - expansion without the absorption effect .",
    "the annihilation timescale is @xmath110 @xcite , while @xmath111 is independent of the photon energy .",
    "therefore , @xmath112 above the spectral break at @xmath113 ev .",
    "the value @xmath102 implies that the index should be @xmath114 .",
    "we should note that photons above @xmath115 ev interact with photons below @xmath116 . in our example in figure [ fig:1 ] ,",
    "the index of the photon distribution for one order of magnitude just below @xmath116 is @xmath117 . in such cases ,",
    "the spectrum should be @xmath118 .",
    "our result seems consistent with those estimates .    in the later stage ( @xmath119 ) ,",
    "the @xmath7-attenuation gradually becomes inefficient , and this causes the photon spectral break energy to increase with time . in this stage",
    "the photon distribution may be in the quasi steady state .",
    "therefore , the spectra for @xmath3 ( photon - density growing stage ) and @xmath120 are different in spite of their similar photon densities . the deviation from a simple power - law seen around 1",

    "we take into account proton synchrotron and photopion production to estimate the cooling timescale .",

    "even so , the peak time for the 10 ( 30 ) gev - lightcurve is earlier than the peak time for the neutrino lightcurve . this may be because the ssc contribution from primary electrons is not negligible in the 10 ( 30 ) gev - lightcurve .    in this example",

    ", we plot the spectra of the neutrino background in figure [ fig:9 ] . here",
    "we have not distinguished between the neutrino species , so the spectrum consists of neutrinos originating from both pion - decay and muon - decay . even though the adopted gamma - ray fluence is larger than the average one , the neutrino fluence is lower than the icecube limit for @xmath175 @xcite",
    "this may be due to the large @xmath1 and @xmath0 in this model .",
    "furthermore , note that the dominant energy region for this model is @xmath176@xmath177 ev , which is well above the energy region constrained with icecube .",
    "both in @xcite and here , the neutrino spectrum is consistent with the commonly considered case where neutrinos from pion - decay dominate , in which the lower energy break of the neutrino spectrum @xcite is given by @xmath178 where we take @xmath179 as the doppler factor , and @xmath180 . as shown in @xcite , a large lorentz factor or a large radius @xmath1",
    "is required in order to have gev photons which escape unabsorbed from the source , and this leads to a lower photopion efficiency and a harder neutrino spectrum .",
    "therefore , such models which result in gev emission can avoid the grb - neutrino upper limit constraints given by icecube .",
    "also , the report in @xcite excludes only grb models with @xmath181 .    with the same method as for the neutrinos",
    ", we also plot the spectrum of the escaped neutrons without the gzk effect in figure [ fig:9 ] .",
    "the neutron energy range extends as far as the uhecr energy region , and the contribution from those 667 grbs in this simple model seems close to the uhecr spectrum obtained with _",
    "the isotropic - equivalent energy of the neutrons escaped per burst ( assuming @xmath168 pulses ) is @xmath182 erg , comparable to the energy emitted per burst ( 30 pulses ) in @xmath183-rays , @xmath184 erg .",
    "however , at @xmath185 ev the gzk effect is crucial so that we should count only grbs within the gzk horizon ( @xmath149 mpc ) .",
    "the grb rate within 100 mpc sphere ( @xmath186 the gzk horizon ) becomes @xmath187 grbs @xmath188 for the optimistic rate of @xmath189 @xcite .",
    "here we simply assume that grbs occur with this rate at a distance of 100 mpc , and we plot the uhecr flux from those grbs as the dashed line in figure [ fig:9 ] .",
    "note that even though we adopt @xmath190 .",
    "the energy fraction of escaped neutrons to gamma - rays is @xmath191 , due to the larger radius and @xmath0 leading to a modest @xmath192 rate .",
    "the uhecr flux level at @xmath185 ev is lower than the observed flux by a factor of @xmath193 , which implies that ten times the gamma - ray energy is required to be emitted as cosmic rays to make grbs dominant sources of uhecrs .",
    "this is reconfirmation of the difficulty in grb - uhecr scenario pointed out in @xcite .",
    "here we have taken the most pessimistic assumption for uhecr production , namely , that the high - energy protons can not escape until they have cooled adiabatically . as a result , the escaped - neutron energy is a few percent of the injected energy of protons .",
    "some mechanism to make protons escape may be required to produce uhecrs from grbs .",
    "of course , we also have to include the luminosity function , redshift distribution , and the uncertainties discussed in @xcite",

    "here we adopt a more specific parameter set that mimics a pulse of the bright grbs observed with _",
    "the model parameters are @xmath194 , @xmath195 cm , @xmath196 erg , and @xmath197 erg ( @xmath198 ) including the acceleration effect after injection .",
    "the initial magnetic field @xmath199 g is determined by the same method in  [ sec : mod ] as @xmath200 at @xmath146 .",
    "the peak energy @xmath33 is adjusted to be @xmath201 mev by adopting @xmath202 gev .",
    "the evolution of the particle spectra in the shell frame ( figure [ fig:10 ] ) is similar to that for the `` moderate '' case in figure [ fig:4 ] .",
    "however , the gamma - ray spectral bump above @xmath203 ev is here attributed purely to hadrons .",
    "although the ratio @xmath71 is the same as that for the `` moderate '' case , the klein ",
    "nishina effect is crucial because of the very high @xmath204 .",
    "therefore , the ic emission does not yield a spectral bump in this case . as the photon density increases",
    ", photons due to electromagnetic cascade triggered by photopion production appear above @xmath203 ev .",
    "assuming @xmath121 , we plot the observer - frame spectral evolution in figure [ fig:11 ] .",
    "initially ( @xmath205 s ) the spectral shape is close to the simple band function , and no spectral bump appears in the gev energy range . in the later phase ,",
    "the hadronic component appears , and the entire shape gradually evolves into flat one .",
    "this evolution is similar to the spectral behavior in grb 080916c @xcite .",
    "the effect of the hadronic cascade on the spectral flatness is well shown in the time - integrated spectra in figure [ fig:12 ] .",
    "in contrast to this two - component hadronic behavior , the purely leptonic case for the same parameters leads to a pure band - type time - integrated spectrum .",
    "the spectral shape is almost unchanged during the emission in the leptonic model .",
    "the lightcurve in figure [ fig:13 ] shows a significant delay of the 10 gev - lightcurve .",
    "the delay timescale ( @xmath206 s ) is comparable to the delay seen in grb 080916c @xcite . in this case ssc",
    "is negligible , so the gev spectral - bump is purely due to hadronic cascade .",
    "unlike in the `` moderate case '' , the peak time of the 10 gev photon lightcurve is here relatively close to the peak time for the neutrinos .",
    "thus , the lack of ssc effects ( moderated by the klein ",
    "nishina effect here ) is of key importance in emphasizing the delayed onset in hadronic models .",
    "the 10 gev - lightcurve shows a significantly broader fwhm ( @xmath207 s ) than the fwhm of the mev - lightcurve ( @xmath208 s ) . in the same model without proton injection ( dashed lines ) ,",
    "the high - energy lightcurve is rather narrower than the mev lightcurve .",
    "the onsets of the gev and mev lightcurves are almost simultaneous .",
    "thus , for this parameter set , the difference between hadronic and leptonic models is prominent .",
    "here we have adopted a very large energy per pulse . in such cases",
    "the number of pulses may be a few , and the expected rate of such bright _ fermi_-lat grbs ( in this example the fluence is @xmath209 ) may be less than 10 per year .",
    "thus , in the same manner as in figure [ fig:9 ] adopting @xmath210 and the rate @xmath211 , we plot the spectra of the neutrino and neutron due to bright _",
    "fermi_-lat grbs in figure [ fig:14 ] .",
    "the spectrum of the escaped neutrons ranges as far as the uhecr energy scale in this model also .",
    "the contribution to the diffuse neutrino background and to the integrated flux of escaping neutrons are smaller than in the `` moderate case '' , owing to the low grb rate with such parameters . however , the spectral flux of the neutrons at @xmath185 ev is comparable to that in the `` moderate case '' , although such neutrons lose their energy by the gzk process .",
    "( note that here we assumed @xmath121 , and the equivalent rate from within 100 mpc would be much smaller than that for the  moderate \" hadronic case parameters ) .",
    "the isotropic - equivalent energy of neutrons per pulse is @xmath212 erg , which is only @xmath213 % of the injected energy of protons , while the emitted isotropic - equivalent gamma - ray energy per pulse is @xmath214 erg .",
    "the isotropic - equivalent energy of the neutrinos per pulse is @xmath215 erg .",
    "the break energy at @xmath216 ev in the neutrino spectrum is in apparent contradiction with equation ( [ eq : nubr ] ) for this parameter set .",
    "the reason is that in this case the pion production efficiency is not high enough , even for protons of @xmath217 , the efficiency increasing as @xmath218 , as mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : model ] .",
    "the neutron spectrum in the  fermi lat \" case in fig .",
    "[ fig:14 ] has a sharper peak at @xmath219 ev than the  moderate \" model of fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] .",
    "this indicates that only very high - energy protons near the cut - off energy produce pions efficiently .",
    "the high - energy bump at @xmath220 ev in the neutrino spectrum is attributed to pion - decays from such high - energy protons / neutrons , while the low - energy break is attributed to the muon - decay component .",
    "thus , also for this parameter set , the neutrino energy range is well above the energy range constrained by icecube .",
    "the neutrino fluence ( @xmath221 ) from this pulse corresponds to @xmath222 of the icecube limit ( @xmath223 , * ? ? ?",
    "a different hadronic model is the proton synchrotron model @xcite . to test this case with the same lorentz factor and initial radius as those in  [ sec : lat ] we need to use extreme values for some of the other parameters , in order to ensure that proton synchrotron contributes to gev energy range .",
    "thus , we adopt @xmath224 erg , and @xmath225 erg ( @xmath226 ) , and the initial magnetic field @xmath227 g ( @xmath228 at @xmath146 ) .",
    "the minimum energy of electrons is set as @xmath229 gev . if the acceleration parameter @xmath230 for protons is unity , the maximum energy of protons in this strong magnetic field becomes too large and cascade emission from photopion production overwhelms the proton synchrotron emission .",
    "this is because the soft photon spectrum @xmath137 implies @xmath40 . in order to suppress photopion production ,",
    "we degrade the maximum energy of protons by adopting @xmath231 .    the resultant spectral evolution for an observer at @xmath121 is shown in figure [ fig:15 ] .",
    "here the second peak of the photon spectra is due to proton synchrotron radiation .",
    "it is seen that proton synchrotron can produce harder spectra than the cascade emission seen in figure [ fig:11 ] . even in this case , however , we can not neglect photopion production . in the later phases ,",
    "the spectrum becomes flat owing to the cascade triggered by photopions .",
    "the delay time of the 10 gev - lightcurve ( figure [ fig:16 ] ) is similar to that for the `` fermi - lat '' case .",
    "this is because the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath29 are common and the gev bump is due to purely hadronic effects in both models .",
    "however , the fwhm of the 10 gev - lightcurve is narrower here and the decay timescale of the 10 gev emission seems almost the same as the timescale in the mev emission , while the 30 gev - lightcurve is narrower than the mev lightcurve .",
    "this depends on the redshift , or on model parameters ( @xmath0 etc . ) .",
    "however , for the proton synchrotron model , the pulse decay timescale roughly corresponds to the synchrotron cooling timescale , so that the decrease of the pulse timescale with photon energy may be a characteristic feature of such models .",
    "although the degeneracy in the parameters is not easy to resolve , having an energy threshold as low as possible could help in distinguishing the previous  fermi - lat \" hadronic cascade and this  fermi - lat \" proton synchrotron model through their lightcurve differences .",
    "the emitted energy as gamma - rays , neutrons , and neutrinos per pulse are @xmath232 erg , @xmath233 erg , and @xmath234 erg , respectively . in figure [ fig:17 ]",
    "we plot the spectra of the escaped neutrons and neutrinos in the same manner ( @xmath210 , 10 grbs @xmath188 ) as in figure [ fig:14 ] .",
    "the maximum energy of neutrons is suppressed by the large @xmath230 ( see equation ( [ acctim ] ) ) .",
    "the neutron and neutrino spectral shape are similar to those in figure [ fig:14 ] , respectively , although the typical energy ranges become lower .",
    "this is because the critical parameters for photopion production ( @xmath1 , @xmath0 , and @xmath235 ) are almost the same in the two cases .",
    "we have simulated the time evolution of the particle energy distributions in a relativistically expanding shell with parameters corresponding to that of grbs observed by _ fermi _ , and discussed the spectral evolution of the radiation seen in the observer frame . if we adopt a very weak magnetic field in the shell in a one - zone leptonic model , the slow evolution of the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) emission due to the klein ",
    "nishina effect results in a delayed onset of the gev emission , by amounts comparable to those observed by _",
    "fermi_. however , in such leptonic models the fwhm of the gev lightcurve is almost the same as that of the 0.11mev lightcurves , although the present - day low photon statistics in the gev range makes it hard to compare the fwhms . on the other hand , an external inverse compton ( eic ) model , which is essentially a leptonic two - zone model ,",
    "can reproduce the gev - delay naturally .",
    "a long tail for the gev lightcurve , as shown in am11 , is possible evidence for this model .",
    "this can partially contribute to the extended gev emission seen in several grbs ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we have also tested the @xmath7-opacity evolution effect with our code .",
    "at least in our one - zone formulation , an electron injection timescale longer than the expansion timescale is required in order to observe the opacity damping .",
    "the resultant lightcurves have a characteristic shape , and the growth of the cutoff energy is more gradual than in the current sample of _",
    "fermi_-lat bursts , which so far do not show a similar spectral evolution .",
    "thus , @xmath7-opacity evolution can not be the reason for the delay .",
    "the hadronic models studied here include both cascade models and a proton synchrotron model , both of which are able to reproduce the delayed onset with a delay timescale close to the pulse timescale ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the delay is due to the long acceleration timescale of protons and continuous photopion production after the end of the particle injection .",
    "the wider fwhm for the gev lightcurve than for then mev lightcurve could be a signature of the hadronic cascade . if the klein ",
    "nishina effect prevents ic emissions , the delay due to hadronic cascade becomes more dominant .",
    "the amounts of escaped uhe neutrons in our examples are comparable to the gamma - ray energy .",
    "since we have adopted large @xmath0 and @xmath29 values in order to simulate grbs where gev photons are able escape from the source , the resultant neutrino spectra are hard enough to avoid the current flux limit constraints from icecube .",
    "in addition , as the _ fermi _ team indicates @xcite , grbs with extra components in the gev band may be a small fraction of the grb population .",
    "therefore , even if grbs accelerate uhe particles , the typical grb parameters are in a range which implies a sufficiently low neutrino and gev gamma - ray production efficiency .",
    "our hadronic model also predicts a delayed onset of the neutrino emission , which is more pronounced than the corresponding gev photon delay .",
    "if neutrinos are eventually observed , this may be another point which could be tested by future neutrino observations .",
    "the energy budget required for being uhecr sources appears insufficient in our examples . in future work",
    ", we plan to include the redshift evolution , luminosity function , and other details to further test the viability of the grb - uhecr scenario .",
    "the open problem of the low - energy photon spectral index @xmath236 is not addressed in this paper . here",
    "we inject the electrons in the usual manner ; the minimum energy of the electrons at injection @xmath204 being a free parameter is written by the phenomenological parameters : @xmath237 and the number fraction of the accelerated electrons , both of which are not well constrained so far . ] .",
    "the synchrotron cooling results in a soft effective electron distribution ( @xmath238 ) , so @xmath239 is unavoidable in this type of simulations .",
    "spectral slopes such as these , while softer than the average @xmath240 , are present in the batse data base .",
    "such softer slopes have the result of enhancing the photopion production efficiency , as well as the resultant flux of escaped neutrons .",
    "note that here the energy fraction in protons required to generate a gev extra component is not so high , @xmath241@xmath242 ( @xmath243 , in alternate notation ) , compared with the case of grb 090510 where @xmath244 was required to reconcile with the observed index @xmath245 @xcite .",
    "another consequence is that the soft spectra make it difficult to find a low - energy spectral excess in the x - ray region . in our hadronic examples",
    ", the low - energy excess appears in the later stages , when the power - law component due to the hadronic cascade becomes prominent or dominant over the entire spectrum . on the other hand , in order to have a self - consistent one - zone synchrotron model whether leptonic or hadronic , some mechanism to harden the spectrum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) would need to be included , which could change the lightcurves or the uhecr production efficiency .    in our simulations",
    "the minimum - lorentz factor of electrons at injection @xmath246 is assumed , for simplicity , to be constant during the injection .",
    "thus , our simulations do not show a significant @xmath33-evolution , as seen in figure [ fig:11 ] , whereas an increase of @xmath33 around the time of the gev onset has been reported in grb 080916c and 090902b . to reproduce such a @xmath33-evolution in our model",
    ", a growth of @xmath246 during the injection would need to be introduced . however ,",
    "in grb 090926a the @xmath33 does not change drastically around the gev onset time @xcite . given this variety of spectral evolution behaviors , at this stage one",
    "is unfortunately left without a definite guideline for including a temporal evolution of the model parameters .    in summary the gev delays can be explained either by a one - zone leptonic model with very low magnetic field and high luminosity ( am11 ) , or by normal parameter range one - zone hadronic models ( this work ) , or also by a normal magnetic field and luminosity two - zone leptonic model via eic @xcite .",
    "however , the lightcurve behavior of these models differ substantially from each other .",
    "the qualitative tendency of the multi - gev lightcurves discussed here can be tested with future atmospheric cherenkov telescopes such as cta . for this purpose",
    ", it would be desirable that the low - energy threshold of those telescopes should be as low as possible , in order to ensure good photon statistics as well as the capability to observe the spectral evolution below the @xmath7 cutoff energy due to ebl .",
