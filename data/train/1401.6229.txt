    "<S> we observe that @xmath58 and @xmath59 in the plateaus ( note that @xmath60 holds in the steady states ) .    </S>",
    "<S> next we investigate the relationship with the energy differences . </S>",
    "<S> as we mentioned , the plateaus are observed in the dependence on the chemical potential @xmath5 . in the qme , especially in the superoperator @xmath25 , @xmath45 ( rather than @xmath5 itself ) and the eigenenergy differences appear [ see the below of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ l_pump ] ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we investigate @xmath45 and the eigenenergy differences .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : frequency](c ) , we plot @xmath45 and @xmath61 , where @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) are the eigenenergies for the ground and @xmath62th excited states of the effective hamiltonian @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that @xmath46 and @xmath48 cross with @xmath45 respectively at the ends of the first and second plateaus , whereas @xmath47 crosses with @xmath45 in the transition region between the first and second plateaus .    from these observations </S>",
    "<S> , we have a following mechanism scenario of the plateaus . </S>",
    "<S> first we discuss the first plateau . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath63 , i.e. , before the end of the first plateau , the ground state is the only channel available for pumping from the tls bath . before the first plateau starts , @xmath43 is a convex function of @xmath5 , whereas @xmath44 is almost proportional to @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> these behaviors of the currents possibly result from the fact that , for each single pumping channel , @xmath64 is bounded above whereas @xmath65 is not . due to these behaviors , @xmath44 can catch up with @xmath43 at certain @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> however , it can not go over @xmath43 since @xmath66 holds in the steady states . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the first plateau starts from this value of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath5 increases further , @xmath45 gets equal to @xmath46 , which results in the open of a new channel  the first excited state  for pumping from the tls bath . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the system can go out of the first plateau when @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario requires the existence of @xmath44 , which is consistent with the fact that the cavity loss is crucial for the plateaus .    </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the beginning of the second plateau is the point where @xmath44 catches up with @xmath43 again . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , we should note that @xmath45 crosses with @xmath47 before the second plateau starts . </S>",
    "<S> thus we do not observe the end of the plateau at this point although the pumping channel of the second excited state opens . </S>",
    "<S> instead , we observe the effect of this channel open as the jumps in @xmath40 [ fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : frequency](a ) ] and in the currents [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : frequency](b ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> the end of the second plateau is the point where @xmath45 crosses with @xmath48 and the pumping channel of the third excited state opens .    </S>",
    "<S> finally we remark that in the plateau regions the input excitation of the tlss is almost perfectly converted to the output of the photons because @xmath58 holds there . in this sense , </S>",
    "<S> conversion efficiency of this system in the plateaus is nearly 100% .    </S>",
    "<S> _ details of the mf - qme_.the hamiltonian of the total system ( array + baths ) is given by @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ h_s ] ) , and @xmath70 and @xmath71 are respectively the hamiltonians of the tls and photon baths including the system - bath interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the baths are sufficiently larger than the array system , so that the tls bath remains in the equilibrium state with @xmath5 and @xmath0 and the photon bath remains in the vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the mf - qme for the array system as follows .    </S>",
    "<S> first , we explain the mf approximation . as we mentioned before , we introduce the oscillating photon field as the mean field : @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> then we use the mf approximation @xcite : @xmath73 . substituting this into the second term in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ h_s ] ) , we obtain the mf system hamiltonian as a sum over the single sites . </S>",
    "<S> we can thus reduce the problem to the single - site one , and will omit the site index : @xmath74 , where @xmath34 is the number of the nearest neighbor sites . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , by transforming into the rotating frame with the frequency @xmath17 , we eliminate the time dependence in @xmath75 ; i.e. , @xmath76 , where @xmath77 , @xmath78 is the total number of photon and tls excitations in the cavity , and @xmath79 is the excitation number in the baths </S>",
    "<S> . then we have the von neumann equation for the density matrix @xmath80 of the total system in the rotating frame as @xmath81 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> next , we explain the qme . starting from the above von neumann equation </S>",
    "<S> , we take the trace over the baths and use the born - markov approximation to obtain the qme in the shrdinger picture ( within the rotating frame ) @xcite : @xmath20 , where @xmath82 and @xmath23 + \\mathcal{l}_{\\rm ph } + \\mathcal{l}_{\\rm tls}$ ] . here </S>",

    "<S> we denote by @xmath85 the projection operator onto the eigenspace belonging to @xmath49 ( eigenvalue of @xmath24 ) . </S>",

    "<S> note that , if the cavity loss is absent ( @xmath38 ) , @xmath25 leads the array system to the equilibrium state with the chemical potential @xmath5 and inverse temperature @xmath0 .    _ </S>",

    "<S> there are two essential elements in the proposed mechanism : one is the existence of discrete energy levels ( or energy gap ) in the system , and the other is that the output current to one of the baths can catch up with the input current from the other bath ( the bounded excitation number of the tls and unbounded photon number would be the origin in our case ) . </S>",
