    "once hydrogen molecule is chosen as potential fuel , its storage , easy discharge for consumption and dissociation into hydrogen atoms to complete the current cycle in the fuel cell to produce the desired electromotive force involve several problems to be solved .",
    "et al._@xcite have pioneered the idea that carbon nanotubes can be efficient , cheap and rechargeable storage medium for small - scale fuel cells by estimating 5 - 10 weight percent ( _ wp _ ) h@xmath0 adsorption in single - wall carbon nanotubes ( swnt ) .",

    "nevertheless , carbon nanotubes have high surface - volume ratio and their functionalization to render them feasible for hydrogen storage through coverage of suitable adatoms has remained to be explored .    in this paper@xcite",
    ", we addressed following questions in order to clarify controversial issues related to the storage of hydrogen molecule on carbon nanotubes : can h@xmath0 molecule be adsorbed on the swnt ?",
    "what is the nature and strength of the bonding ? can the strength of the bonding be modified either by changing the curvature of the surface or by the coadsorption of metal atoms ?",
    "in particular , can the h@xmath0-uptake on swnts be promoted by their functionalization through transition elements ? how can h@xmath0 molecule be dissociated ? to answer all these questions we investigated the interaction between h@xmath0 molecule and bare , radially deformed and foreign atom adsorbed swnts by carrying out calculations within density functional theory ( dft)@xcite .",
    "our results not only advance our understanding of h@xmath0 adsorption on carbon nanotubes , but also suggest new ways for efficient hydrogen storage for rapidly growing research on fuel cells .     between swnt and h@xmath0 molecule as a function of distance @xmath1 between them .",

    "the weak attractive van der waals ( vdw ) interaction becomes crucial in calculating binding energies of weak physisorption bonds , but is not well represented in dft using gga@xcite .",
    "therefore , in the case of physisorption , weak and attractive vdw interaction energy , @xmath3 , is obtained from the slater - kirkwood approximation@xcite using the asymptotic form of the lifshitz s equation@xcite . however",
    ", this approach can not be suitable to determine the contribution of vdw interaction in the chemisorption of molecules . in the present calculations we take the zigzag ( 8,0 ) swnt as a prototype tube .",
    "to clarify whether h@xmath0 can form stable bonding on the outer or inner surface of a swnt , we calculated the chemical interaction energy between h@xmath0 and the outer surface of the ( 8,0 ) swnt at different sites ( _ i.e. _ h - site , above the hexagon ; z- and a - site above the zigzag and above the axial c - c bonds ; t - site , a bridge site between two adjacent zigzag c - c bonds ) as a function of spacing @xmath1 . the chemical interaction energy is obtained from the expression , @xmath4-e_{t}[swnt]-e_{t}[h_{2}]$ ] , in terms of the total energies of bare nanotube ( @xmath5 $ ] ) , free h@xmath0 ( @xmath6 $ ] ) , and h@xmath0 attached to swnt at a distance @xmath1 ( @xmath7 $ ] ) . here",

    "the implementation of h@xmath0 inside the tube having radius in the range of 3    is expected to be hindered by this repulsive interaction .",

    "it has been proposed that the potential barrier for the dissociation of h@xmath0 adsorbed in the interstitial region between tubes can be lowered by applying radial deformation to the rope or swnt@xcite .",

    ", we also obtained very small enhancement of @xmath12 .",
    "hence , the effect of curvature on the binding energy of h@xmath0 is negligible due to relatively large @xmath14 .",
    "this result also suggests that the physisorption energy does not vary significantly depending on the radius of swnt .",
    "apparently , the binding of h@xmath0 on the outer surface of swnt is weak and corresponding physisorption energy is small .",
    "the binding can not be enhanced by increasing the curvature locally through radial deformation .",
    "curvature effect or radial deformation may be significant at small @xmath1 when h@xmath0 is forced towards swnt surface .",
    "next , we examine whether the binding of h@xmath0 is enhanced by the coadsorbed foreign atoms . to this end",

    "the situation with pt atom , which can make strong chemisorption bonds with the outer surface of swnt is found to be interesting from the point of view of h@xmath0 storage .",
    "we showed that h@xmath0 molecule can form chemisorption bonds with free pt as well as pt adsorbed on swnt .",
    "single h@xmath0 adsorbed on a free pt atom dissociates and forms two strong pt - h bonds . on the other hand , while single h@xmath0 molecule is molecularly chemisorbed to a single pt atom at the a - site of swnt surface , it can dissociate if pt atom adsorbed near the hollow site .",
    "even the molecular adsorption of single h@xmath0 can turn dissociative if a second h@xmath0 is molecularly adsorbed to the same pt atom .",
    "the dissociative adsorption is mediated by the weakening of pt - c bonds either due to a specific location of pt on swnt or due to the second h@xmath0 molecularly adsorbed to pt .",
    "dissociative adsorption of single h@xmath0 to a single pt atom on the graphite surface suggests that the dissociation of h@xmath0 is favored on swnts having large radius .",
    "our analysis suggests that single pt adsorbed on swnt can bind up to two h@xmath0 molecules with significant binding energy in the chemisorption range . beyond two adsorbed h@xmath0 ,",
    "additional molecules form weak physisorption bonds with pt .",
    "single pd atom adsorbed on swnt exhibits similar effects but in relatively weaker manner as compared to that of pt .",
    "interesting interaction between h@xmath0 and pt and resulting bonding mechanisms justifies similar investigations of swnts functionalized by other transition elements ( in particular ti , ni , cr , v ) for a higher @xmath57 h@xmath0 storage .                                                            since",
    ", the bond distance of h@xmath0 is extended by 20@xmath58 , the h - h interaction is weaker than that in free h@xmath0 .",
    "for d@xmath591 the adsorption may be considered as an intermediate stage between molecular and atomic adsorption ."
