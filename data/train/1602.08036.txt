    "whereas the finite - temperature properties of the @xmath0=2 + 1 quantum xy model have received a lot of attention over the past few decades  presumably due to the occurrence of the kosterlitz - thouless phase transition  the same can not be said about the quantum xy model in @xmath0=3 + 1 .",
    "apart from some pioneering articles , no systematic studies of its thermodynamic properties at low temperatures , where the spin - wave picture applies , seem to be available .",
    "the present work closes this gap that apparently exists in the condensed matter literature .    as is well - known , the relevant low - energy excitations of the @xmath0=3 + 1 quantum xy model are the spin waves .",
    "they emerge as a consequence of the spontaneously broken internal symmetry o(2 ) @xmath4 1 .",
    "the low - energy behavior of the system can thus be captured by the physics of its goldstone bosons .",
    "this is the effective - field theory point of view we pursue in the present study .",
    "in contrast to spin - wave theory or other microscopic approaches , the effective lagrangian method allows one to study the low - temperature behavior of the @xmath0=3 + 1 quantum xy model systematically and straightforwardly up to three loops , as we demonstrate below .",
    "the properties of the @xmath0=3 + 1 quantum xy model at zero temperature or near the critical temperature , have been addressed with spin - wave theory , high - temperature expansions , monte carlo simulations , and yet other methods @xcite . however , regarding its behavior at low temperatures  between the two extremes @xmath5=@xmath6 and @xmath5=@xmath7  only little appears to be known .",
    "one result concerns the finite - temperature susceptibility in the presence of an external field @xmath8 , that diverges as @xmath9 in weak fields @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that the results presented in ref .",
    "@xcite  in effective field theory language  merely correspond to one - loop effects .",
    "above all , the references @xcite do not address the manifestation of the spin - wave interaction in the thermodynamic behavior of the system .",
    "it is the objective of the present work to go up to three - loop order in the effective expansion and to systematically explore the impact of the spin - wave interaction at low temperatures and weak external fields .",
    "our study thus extends the knowledge on the low - temperature behavior of the @xmath0=3 + 1 quantum xy model substantially .",
    "it should be pointed out that in the context of heisenberg ferromagnets in three spatial dimensions , more than a hundred publications on the manifestation of the spin - wave interaction in the spontaneous magnetization have appeared ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we hence believe that we are dealing with an interesting and important question .    while the leading contribution in the free energy density of the @xmath0=3 + 1 quantum xy model is of order @xmath1",
    ", we find that subleading corrections are of order @xmath2 ( two loops ) and @xmath3 ( three loops ) .",
    "the coefficient of the @xmath2-term can easily be expressed through microscopic quantities , since it only involves the leading - order effective constants @xmath10  where @xmath11 is the spin - wave stiffness  and @xmath12 , i.e. , the order parameter at zero temperature and infinite volume . at the three - loop level ,",
    "the situation is more complicated , as the coefficients of the various @xmath3-terms involve next - to - leading order effective constants that are _ a priori _ unknown .",
    "still , we can estimate their order of magnitude , which leads us to conclude that the three - loop corrections are small .",
    "as it turns out , the spin - wave interaction is repulsive in the pressure at low temperatures and weak magnetic or staggered fields .",
    "remarkably , regarding the order parameter and the susceptibility , the impact of the spin - wave interaction is rather counterintuitive : if the external field is weak , the temperature - dependent interaction contribution in the order parameter is positive , while in the susceptibility it is negative .",
    "it should be stressed that the present effective field theory analysis is completely systematic and goes up to three - loop order .",
    "trying to reach the same level of accuracy with traditional microscopic methods such as spin - wave theory would be formidable .",
    "our results are valid at low temperatures and in weak fields , i.e. , in a regime where both parameters @xmath5 and @xmath13 are small with respect to the exchange integral @xmath14 that defines the natural scale of the system .",
    "note that , on bipartite lattices , the field @xmath15 can be interpreted as magnetic field coupled to the ferromagnetic quantum xy model , or equivalently , as staggered field in connection with the antiferromagnetic xy model .",
    "we should mention , however , that our analysis goes beyond the description of quantum spin models .",
    "our results apply to any @xmath0=3 + 1 ( pseudo-)lorentz - invariant system that is characterized by a spontaneously broken internal symmetry o(2 ) @xmath4 1 .",
    "effective field theories based on goldstone bosons are widely used and well established in particle physics . however , in condensed matter physics , systematic effective lagrangian techniques do not have the same status .",
    "but it is a fact that the low - energy behavior of many condensed matter systems is determined by goldstone bosons  and the effective lagrangian method is just designed for these systems @xcite .",
    "i would like to point out to the condensed matter community that in the past , various systems have successfully been analyzed within effective lagrangian field theory . in particular , systems where the relevant goldstone excitations are spin waves .",
    "these comprise ferromagnetic spin chains @xcite , ferromagnetic films @xcite , and ferromagnets in three spatial dimensions @xcite .",
    "they also include antiferromagnets and xy models in two @xcite and three @xcite spatial dimensions .",
    "apart from these systems whose physics is governed by goldstone bosons , there are situations where additional excitations come into play : for instance high - temperature superconductors that also involve doped holes or electrons .",
    "systematic effective field theories have also been constructed and applied to these remarkable systems , taking into account both square lattice @xcite and honeycomb lattice @xcite geometries .",
    "finally , we refer to refs .",
    "@xcite , where the correctness and consistency of the effective field theory method has been demonstrated in high - accuracy monte carlo simulations .",

    "we assume that the crystal lattice is bipartite , such that there is a mapping between the ferromagnetic ( @xmath21 ) and the antiferromagnetic ( @xmath22 ) model .",
    "our formalism thus either describes the ferromagnetic quantum xy model in an external magnetic field @xmath15 , or the antiferromagnetic quantum xy model in an external staggered field @xmath23 @xcite . while the magnetic field is associated with the magnetization , @xmath24 the staggered field couples to the staggered magnetization vector , @xmath25 at zero temperature and infinite volume , the vacuum expectation values , @xmath26 are nonzero , signaling the spontaneous breakdown of the @xmath27 spin rotation symmetry . in the following",
    ", we will stick to the latter realization , bearing in mind that whenever we speak of the aniferromagnetic xy model in a staggered field , it can also be interpreted as ferromagnetic xy model in a magnetic field .",
    "we now leave the microscopic description and consider the @xmath0=3 + 1 quantum xy model within the effective field theory formalism .",
    "the essential point is that the system is characterized by a spontaneously broken continuous and global spin rotation symmetry : whereas the hamiltonian is invariant under o(2 ) , the ground state is not . as a consequence ,",
    "a goldstone boson excitation emerges  a magnon or spin wave  that dominates the low - temperature physics of the system .",
    "note that these low - energy degrees of freedom obey a linear , i.e. , relativistic dispersion relation .",
    "we then define a unit vector field @xmath28 , @xmath29 whose first component @xmath30 corresponds to the magnon field .",
    "the effective field theory approach is legitimate at low energies or low temperatures , and corresponds to a systematic derivative expansion of the effective lagrangian . clearly , the low - energy physics of the system is dominated by terms that contain just a few time or space derivatives .",
    "higher - derivative terms are successively suppressed and hence are less important . regarding the @xmath0=3 + 1 quantum xy model , the leading piece in the effective lagrangian is @xmath31 and involves terms with two time ( @xmath32 ) and two space ( @xmath33 ) derivatives .",
    "both contributions are of order @xmath34 , and so is the staggered field @xmath35 . at this point",
    "we have three effective constants , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",

    "the leading piece @xmath43 is strictly ( pseudo-)lorentz - invariant . on the other hand , higher - order contributions in the effective lagrangian",
    "do not share this accidental symmetry , and in principle all terms permitted by the discrete symmetries of the lattice have to be considered . in the present study , however , we assume that subleading contributions in the effective lagrangian can also be written in a relativistic form . as we discuss in the next section",
