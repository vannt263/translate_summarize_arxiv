    "fracture functions @xcite have been introduced to interpret within the framework of perturbative qcd semi - inclusive deep inelastic processes in the target fragmentation region .",
    "the formulation of these processes by means of fracture functions does allow to extend the interpretation in terms of qcd - improved parton model to the complementary region of target fragmentation .",
    "this implies a description of deep inelastic processes in terms of the novel fracture functions in addition to the usual factorizable structure and fragmentation functions convoluted with hard point - like cross sections .",
    "the introduction of these new objects requires however the formulation of an additional factorization hypothesis whose validity has been recently argued on the basis of the cut vertex formalism together with the use of infrared power counting .",
    "these results have been obtained within the theoretical framework of @xmath0 field theory @xcite and have been later confirmed in qcd in ref.@xcite .    in order to show that the new factorization hypothesis is correct , in ref.@xcite new objects",
    "have been defined called extended fracture functions , which depend also on the momentum transfer @xmath1 between the incoming and outgoing hadron . by an explicit one - loop calculation",
    "it has been verified that these object do factorize and it has been also observed that they show a new logarithmic dependence on the ratio of the scales @xmath2 and @xmath1 @xcite . as a result extended",
    "fracture functions obey an evolution equation different from the one followed by ordinary fracture functions .",
    "the aim of this note is to show in a simple and direct way that extended and ordinary fracture functions are closely connected . as a consequence",
    "the corresponding evolution equation do follow one from the other .",
    "we work within the framework of jet calculus @xcite by applying the corresponding rules to the evolution equations .",
    "the set of jet calculus rules allows the interpretation in terms of qcd - improved parton model of the results obtained by using a different approach @xcite . by using this method",
    "we can give in fact a definition of the extended fracture function in the region where @xmath1 is a perturbative scale ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "as a consequence a dglap evolution equation for extended fracture functions follows and the inhomogeneous evolution equation for the ordinary fracture function is recovered .",
    "in a deep inelastic semi - inclusive reaction , a hadron @xmath4 with momentum @xmath5 is struck by a far off - shell spacelike photon with momentum @xmath6 and a hadron @xmath7 with momentum @xmath8 is inclusively observed in the final state .",
    "let us define as usual @xmath9 and choose a frame in which @xmath10 with @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "as far as we keep away from the target fragmentation region the cross section factorizes as follows @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the structure and fragmentation function respectively , @xmath16 is the hard semi - inclusive cross section and we have defined @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "( [ current ] ) expresses the fact that , as long as the produced hadron has a large transverse momentum @xmath18 ( i.e. @xmath19 is finite ) it can be thought as a product of the fragmentation of the active parton .",
    "however in the last few years , especially after the appearance of diffractive deep inelastic events at hera , particular attention has been payed to hadron production in the target fragmentation region ( i.e. the region @xmath20 ) , where eq .",
    "( [ current ] ) fails . in ref.@xcite",
    "it has been proposed for target fragmentation the additional factorized term @xmath21 where @xmath22 represent the momentum fraction of the hadron @xmath7 with respect to @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath23 is the fracture function , giving the probability of finding a parton @xmath24 with momentum fraction @xmath25 in the hadron @xmath4 while another hadron @xmath7 with momentum fraction @xmath26 is detected .",
    "the fracture function is expected to satisfy an inhomogeneous evolution equation @xcite , and this fact has been verified at one - loop level in ref.@xcite .",
    "let us consider the case in which the momentum transfer @xmath27 is also measured .",
    "the current and target fragmentation contributions are in this case @xmath28 and @xmath29 the function @xmath30 is the extended fracture function . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that this object can be defined just in terms of a new cut vertex . whereas @xmath31 is expected to satisfy an inhomogeneous evolution equation @xcite , the extended fracture function obeys a simple dglap evolution equation @xcite .",
    "this facts can be understood by making the following observations . in the region @xmath32 the hard semi - inclusive cross section @xmath33 in eq .",
    "( [ currentt ] ) develops large @xmath34 corrections which have to be resummed @xcite . instead of absorbing these logs in @xmath33",
    "we choose to move them in the extended fracture function which , by using jet calculus , can be defined in the perturbative region of @xmath1 as @xmath35    where the integration limits have been obtained implementing momentum conservation .",
    "we work within the leading logarithmic approximation . here",
    "@xmath36 and @xmath37 are regularized and real altarelli - parisi vertices @xcite respectively , and the function @xmath38 is the evolution kernel from @xmath39 to @xmath2 , which obeys the dglap evolution equation : @xmath40 eq .",
    "( [ defpert ] ) is represented in fig .",
    "[ cols=\"^ \" , ]     [ 1 ]    the evolution kernel ( the black blob in fig .",
    "1 ) resums the dependence on @xmath2 and @xmath1 in terms of logarithms of the form @xmath41 and at first order in @xmath42 has the following expression @xmath43    in this way we have absorbed these large logarithms in the definition of @xmath30 which in the perturbative region of @xmath1 is resolved in the convolution of the objects contained in the dotted box in fig 1 .    from eq .",
    "( [ defpert ] ) it appears that the @xmath2 dependence of the extended fracture function is completely given by the evolution kernel @xmath44 and therefore the evolution equation is @xmath45 at least in the perturbative region of @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath46 .",
    "therefore the anomalous dimension associated to the extended fracture function is the same that controls the evolution of ordinary structure functions .",
    "let us suppose now that , as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , the evolution equation ( [ eqomo ] ) applies also within the small @xmath1 region and define the integrated fracture function as an integral over @xmath1 up to a @xmath2-dependent cut - off of order @xmath2 , say @xmath47 , with @xmath48 @xmath49 by taking the logarithmic derivative of eq .",
    "( [ defin ] ) we have that @xmath50 we see appearing an inhomogeneous term in the evolution equation of @xmath51 which arises from the @xmath2 dependence of the upper integration limit .",
    "this inhomogeneous term depends on the value of @xmath52 in the perturbative region of @xmath1 where eq .",
    "( [ defpert ] ) holds . by using the boundary condition @xmath53 on eq .",
    "( [ defpert ] ) we get for the inhomogeneous term , up to @xmath54 corrections , @xmath55    by substituting eq .",
    "( [ termineino ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ inhom ] ) the evolution equation for @xmath51 appears to be @xmath56 that is exactly the one proposed in ref.@xcite .",
    "furthermore the perturbative definition ( [ defpert ] ) can be used to derive the evolution with @xmath1 of the extended fracture function . in order to make the notation less cumbersome",
    ", it is convenient to define @xmath57 one can verify that eq .",
    "( [ defpert ] ) becomes @xmath58 where we have defined @xcite @xmath59 and @xmath60 the @xmath1 evolution equation contains several terms : the first comes from the canonical scale dependence of the extended fracture function , the second from the scale dependence of @xmath42 , and the third from the scale dependence of the evolution kernel .",
    "there are then two inhomogeneous terms which follow from the @xmath1 dependence of structure and fragmentation functions respectively . by explicitly deriving eq .",
    "( [ defpertm ] ) with respect to @xmath1 we get @xmath61 where @xmath62    we conclude this section by stressing that one can define the fracture function in a more general way as an integral up to an arbitrary @xmath2-dependent integration limit @xmath63 in this case the evolution equation reads @xmath64 or , by taking double moments , @xmath65 in the case in which @xmath66 the evolution equation ( [ eqnonomo ] ) is of course recovered .",
    "one could even define a more general fracture function introducing also a lower integration limit @xmath67 @xmath68 and the equation would have an additional inhomogeneous term taking into account the @xmath2 dependence of the lower integration limit @xmath69    phenomenologically these two cases would correspond to the production of hadrons within the target fragmentation region with transverse momentum below @xmath70 and between @xmath67 and @xmath70 respectively .",
    "in ref.@xcite it was shown that fracture functions obey the following momentum sum rule @xmath71 which accounts for momentum conservation in the @xmath72-channel . in this section",
    "we want investigate if a momentum sum rule holds also in the @xmath1-channel . taking moments of eq .",
    "( [ eqnonomo ] ) with @xmath73 , @xmath74 and summing over @xmath75 we get @xcite @xmath76 where we made use of the well - known property of the splitting function @xcite @xmath77 and of the relation @xmath78 from eq .",
    "( [ violated ] ) it appears that the derivative of @xmath79 receives contribution from the inhomogeneous term in the evolution equation .",
    "this fact suggests that the sum rule could be violated because at values of @xmath1 of order @xmath2 the current contribution becomes important and the two production mechanisms can not be disentangled .",
    "as far as the extended fracture function is concerned , since @xmath52 obeys the dglap evolution equation , it follows that @xmath80 and momentum conservation in the @xmath1 channel is recovered . in the perturbative region of @xmath1 , by using eq .",
    "( [ defpert ] ) , we find @xmath81",
    "in this note we showed that a formulation of perturbative processes in the target fragmentation region can be given by using the formalism of jet calculus @xcite .",
    "a perturbative evaluation in terms of evolution equation and anomalous dimensions of extended fracture function is consistent with the evolution equations proposed in ref.@xcite and @xcite for ordinary and extended fracture functions respectively .",
    "we showed that the inhomogeneous term in eq .",
    "( [ eqnonomo ] ) precisely stems from the integration over momentum transfer @xmath1 .",
    "moreover in this formalism the extension to next - to - leading order seems quite natural and suggests that eqs .",
    "( [ eqomo ] ) and ( [ eqnonomo ] ) keep the same structure in the two - loops approximation , analogously to what happens for ordinary structure and fragmentation functions @xcite .    in the region @xmath32",
    "the hard semi - inclusive cross section develops large @xmath34 corrections which need to be resummed .",
    "our approach is based on the idea of absorbing such corrections in the definition of @xmath30 , namely , @xmath34 are fully contained in the evolution kernel @xmath82 .",
    "these logs , which can be treated with standard renormalization group techniques , are new and potentially useful to understand the dynamics of hadro - production in the target fragmentation region .",
    "these logs could affect significantly observables like multiplicities and particle distributions and we believe that a phenomenological study of the role of these corrections would be useful .",
    "as originally proposed in ref.@xcite and in ref.@xcite , there now seems to be a widespread consensus that the @xmath2 evolution in the diffractive regime can be described in terms of the perturbative qcd formalism @xcite .",
    "the data taken by h1 collaboration @xcite , showing an evidence of a consistent logarithmic scaling violation in diffractive channels have further stressed that such an interpretation is not far from the experimental observation .",
    "all this is consistent with a description in terms of fracture functions .",
    "our results agree with such an expectation , although in the limit @xmath83 our formulae will show the appearance of large @xmath84 factors which should be resummed as well . for the treatment of such a singular region",
    "we believe an approach can be used close to the one followed in the inclusive case .    as a concluding remark",
    "we want to stress that the results presented here completely agree with those of ref.@xcite , obtained within a quite different framework , namely , that of a generalized cut vertex expansion which , as a generalization of operator product expansion , appears to be founded on a firmer theoretical standpoint . once more the equivalence of parton - like and ope - like approaches is verified .",
