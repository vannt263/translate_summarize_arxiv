    "the brauer algebra @xmath0 was introduced to provide a corresponding duality for the symplectic and orthogonal groups @xcite .",
    "the abstract @xmath2-algebra is defined for each @xmath3 , however for brauer the key case is @xmath4 with @xmath5 integral , when the action of @xmath0 on @xmath6 can be identified with the centraliser algebra for the corresponding group action of o@xmath7 for @xmath5 positive , and with sp@xmath8 for @xmath5 negative ) . in characteristic",
    "@xmath9 , the natural algebra in correspondence to the centraliser algebra for @xmath5 negative is the symplectic schur algebra @xcite .",
    "for @xmath10 the centraliser algebra is a proper quotient of the brauer algebra .",
    "thus , despite the fact that the symplectic and orthogonal groups , and hence the centraliser , are semisimple over @xmath11 , the brauer algebra can have a non - trivial cohomological structure in such cases .",
    "brown @xcite showed that the brauer algebra is semisimple over @xmath11 for generic values of @xmath5 .",
    "wenzl proved that @xmath0 is semisimple over @xmath11 for all non - integer @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "it was not until very recently that any progress was made in positive characteristic .",
    "a necessary and sufficient condition for semisimplicity ( valid over an arbitrary field ) was given by rui @xcite .",
    "the blocks were determined in characteristic zero @xcite by the authors .",
    "the block result uses the theory of towers of recollement developed in @xcite , and built on work by doran , hanlon and wales @xcite .",
    "the approach was combinatorial , using the language of partitions and tableaux , and depended also on a careful analysis of the action of the symmetric group @xmath12 , realised as a subalgebra of the brauer algebra .",
    "however , we speculated in @xcite that there could be an alcove geometric version , in the language of algebraic lie theory @xcite ( despite the absence of an obvious lie - theoretic context ) .",
    "this should replace the combinatorics of partitions by the action of a suitable reflection group on a weight space , so that the blocks correspond to orbits under this action . in this paper",
    "we will give such a geometric description of this block result .",
    "a priori there is no specific evidence from algebraic lie theory to suggest that such a reflection group action will exist ( beyond certain similarities with the partition algebra case , where there is a reflection group of infinite type @xmath13 @xcite ) .",
    "as already noted , the obvious link to lie theory ( via the duality with symplectic and orthogonal groups ) in characteristic zero only corresponds to a semisimple quotient .",
    "remarkably however , we will show that there is a weyl group @xmath14 of type @xmath15 which does control the representation theory . to obtain a natural action of this group",
    ", we will find that it is easier to work with the transpose of the usual partition notation .",
    "( this is reminiscent of the relation under ringel duality between the combinatorics of the symmetric and general linear groups , although we do not have a candidate for a corresponding dual object in this case . )",
    "our proof of the geometric block result in characteristic @xmath16 is entirely combinatorial , as we show that the action of @xmath14 corresponds to the combinatorial description of blocks in @xcite .",
    "however , having done this , it is natural to consider extending these results to arbitrary fields .    as the algebras and ( cell ) modules under consideration can all be defined integrally ( over @xmath17 $ ] ) , one might hope that some aspects of the characteristic @xmath16 theory could be translated to other characteristics by a reduction mod @xmath9 argument . if this were the case then , for consistency between different values of @xmath5 which are congruent modulo @xmath9 , we might expect that the role of the weyl group would be replaced by the corresponding affine weyl group , so that blocks again lie within orbits",
    ".    we will extend certain basic results in @xcite to arbitrary characteristic , and then show that orbits of the affine weyl group do indeed correspond to ( possibly non - trivial ) unions of blocks of the brauer algebra .",
    "in section [ braueris ] we review some basic properties of the brauer algebra , following @xcite .",
    "sections [ wis ] and [ waffis ] review the weyl and affine weyl groups of type @xmath15 , and give a combinatorial description of their orbits on a weight space . using this description",
    "we prove in section [ blockzero ] that we can restate the block result from @xcite using weyl group orbits .",
    "section [ blockp ] generalises certain representation theoretic results from @xcite and @xcite to positive characteristic , which are then used to give a necessary condition for two weights to lie in the same block in terms of the affine weyl group .    in section [ absect ]",
    "we describe how abacus notation @xcite can be applied to the brauer algebra , and use this to show that the orbits of the affine weyl group do not give a sufficient condition for two weights to lie in the same block .",
    "we begin with a very brief review of the basic theory of brauer algebras ; details can be found in @xcite .",
    "fix an algebraically closed field @xmath2 of characteristic @xmath18 , and some @xmath3 . for @xmath19",
    "the brauer algebra @xmath0 can be defined in terms of a basis of partitions of @xmath20 into pairs . to determine the product @xmath21 of two basis elements , represent each by a graph on @xmath22 points , and identify the vertices @xmath23 of @xmath13 with the vertices @xmath24 of @xmath25 respectively .",

    "usually we represent basis elements graphically by a diagram with @xmath29 northern nodes numbered @xmath30 to @xmath29 from left to right , and @xmath29 southern nodes numbered @xmath31 to @xmath32 from left to right , where each node is connected to precisely one other by a line .",

    "this is most conveniently demonstrated using the abacus notation @xcite , and so we first explain how this can be applied in the brauer algebra case .",

    "we shall associate a certain configuration of beads on an abacus in the following manner .",
    "abacus with @xmath9 runners _ will consist of @xmath9 columns ( called runners ) together with some number of beads distributed amongst these runners .",
    "such beads will lie at a fixed height on the abacus , and there may be spaces between beads on the same runner .",
    "we will number the possible bead positions from left to right in each row , starting from the top row and working down , as illustrated in figure [ abacus ] .      for a fixed value of @xmath29 , we will associate to each partition @xmath404 of @xmath56 , with @xmath66 and @xmath405 even , a configuration of beads on the abacus .",
    "let @xmath406 be a positive integer such that @xmath407 .",
    "we then represent @xmath54 on the abacus using @xmath406 beads by placing a bead in position numbered @xmath408 for each @xmath409 , where we take @xmath67 for @xmath410 . in representing such a configuration",
    "we will denote the beads for @xmath411 by black circles , for @xmath412 by grey beads , and the spaces by white circles ( or blanks if this is unambiguous ) .",
    "runners will be numbered left to right from @xmath16 to @xmath413 .",
    "for example , the abacus corresponding to the partition @xmath414 when @xmath302 , @xmath415 , and @xmath416 is given in figure [ exab ] . note that the abacus uniquely determines the partition @xmath54 .",
    "we would like a way of identifying whether two partitions @xmath54 and @xmath115 are in the same @xmath274 orbit directly from their abacus representation .",
    "first let us rephrase the content condition which we had earlier .",
    "recall from proposition [ orbits2 ] and the definition of @xmath417 that @xmath54 and @xmath115 are in the same @xmath274-orbit if and only if there exists @xmath89 such that for each @xmath418 either @xmath419 or @xmath420 and the second case occurs an even number of times .    choose @xmath421 with @xmath422 ( such a @xmath406 always exists as @xmath273 ) . then @xmath54 and @xmath115 are in the same @xmath274-orbit if and only if there exists @xmath89 such that for each @xmath418 either @xmath423 or @xmath424 and the second case occurs an even number of times .",
    "thus if we also choose @xmath406 large enough such that @xmath54 and @xmath115 can be represented on an abacus with @xmath406 beads then ( [ samerun ] ) says that the bead corresponding to @xmath425 is on the same runner as the bead corresponding to @xmath426 , and ( [ diffrun ] ) says that the bead corresponding to @xmath425 is on runner @xmath312 only if the bead corresponding to @xmath426 is on runner @xmath427 .",
    "note that for corresponding black beads on runner @xmath16 both ( [ samerun ] ) and ( [ diffrun ] ) hold , and so we can use this pair of beads to modify @xmath117 to ensure that it is even . obviously if there are no such black beads then the number of beads changing runners between @xmath54 and @xmath115 must be even .",
    "further , the grey beads ( for @xmath428 ) are the same on each abacus .",
    "summarising , we have              to illustrate this result , consider the case @xmath415 and the partitions @xmath431 take @xmath302 and @xmath128 , then @xmath416 satisfies @xmath422 , and is large enough for all three partitions to be represented using @xmath406 beads .",
    "the respective abacuses are illustrated in figure [ threeab ] , with the matching rows for condition ( ii ) in proposition [ abblock ] indicated .",
    "we see that @xmath336 , as the number of beads on runner @xmath16 , and on runners @xmath432 and @xmath433 are the same for both @xmath54 and @xmath115 ( respectively 5 , 8 , and 7 ) and there is a black bead on runner @xmath16 .",
    "( the number of beads moving from runner @xmath312 to a distinct runner @xmath427 is @xmath30 , which is odd .",
    "however , as discussed above , we can chose @xmath434 such that one of the two black beads on runner @xmath16 is regarded as moving ( to the same runner ) , to obtain the required even number of such moves .",
    "if there were no black beads on runner @xmath16 then this would not be possible . ) however , @xmath435 as columns @xmath432 and @xmath433 have 9 and 6 entries respectively .",
    "these will not correspond directly to partitions @xmath54 and @xmath115 , as the degree of each partition will be much larger than @xmath406 .",
    "however , by completing each in the same way ( by adding the same number of black beads in rows from right to left above each partition , followed by a suitable number of grey beads ) , they can be adapted to form abacuses of partitions @xmath309 and @xmath436 for some @xmath438 and for some @xmath439 .",
    "( this corresponds to adding sufficiently many zeros to the end of each partition such that each has @xmath440 parts . )",
    "it is clear from proposition [ abblock ] that in each case @xmath54 and @xmath115 are in the same @xmath274-orbit .",
    "note that for both @xmath54 and @xmath115 , all beads are as high as they can be on their given runner .",
    "if we move any bead to a higher numbered position then this corresponds to increasing the degree of the associated partition .",
    "thus @xmath54 and @xmath115 are the only partitions with degree at most @xmath440 in their @xmath274-orbit.also it is easy to check that @xmath115 is obtained from @xmath54 by removing two boxes from the same row . clearly by increasing @xmath406 we can make @xmath29 arbitrarily large .    to complete the proof ,",
    "it is enough to show that @xmath441 and @xmath442 are not in the same @xmath0-block .",
    "we will reduce this to a calculation for the symmetric group , and use the corresponding ( known ) block result in that case . to state this",
    "we need to recall the notion of a @xmath9-core .",
    "a partition is a _",
    "@xmath9-core _ if the associated abacus has no gap between any pair of beads on the same runner .",
    "we associate a unique @xmath9-core to a given partition @xmath443 by sliding all beads in some abacus representation of @xmath443 as far up each runner as they can go , and taking the corresponding partition . by the nakayama conjecture ( see @xcite for a survey of its various proofs ) , two partitions @xmath443 and @xmath175 are in the same block for @xmath47 if and only if they have the same @xmath9-core .",
    "it is also easy to show ( using the definition of @xmath9-cores involving the removal of @xmath9-hooks @xcite ) that if @xmath443 is a @xmath9-core then so is @xmath444 .",
    "returning to our proof , as @xmath309 we have that the cell module @xmath326 is isomorphic to the specht module @xmath445 as a @xmath47-module ( by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2 ) ) .",
    "as @xmath54 is a @xmath9-core so is @xmath146 , and hence @xmath326 is in a @xmath47-block on its own ( by the nakayama conjecture ) so is simple as a @xmath47-module , isomorphic to @xmath446 , and hence equal to @xmath441 as a @xmath0-module .",
