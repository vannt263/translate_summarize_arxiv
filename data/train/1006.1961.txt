    "the main motivation for studying heavy - ion collisions at high energy is the study of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in extreme conditions of high temperature and high energy density  @xcite .",
    "ultra - relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) create nuclear matter of high energy density over an extended volume , allowing qcd predictions to be tested in the laboratory . at high temperature and density ,",
    "qcd predicts a phase transition from nuclear matter to a state of deconfined quarks and gluons known as the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "one of the proposed signatures of the qgp state is the modification of vector meson production rates and their in - medium properties  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath13 meson is of particular interest due to its very short lifetime and its strange valence quark content .",
    "this makes the @xmath13 meson sensitive to the properties of the dense matter and strangeness production from an early partonic phase  @xcite .",
    "since the lifetime of the @xmath13 is @xmath14 4 fm/@xmath5 , less than the lifetime of the system formed in heavy ion collisions  @xcite , the @xmath13 is expected to decay , re - scatter , and regenerate all the way to the kinetic freeze - out ( vanishing elastic collisions ) .",
    "the characteristic properties of the resonance may be modified due to high density and/or high temperature of the medium causing in - medium effects .",
    "various in - medium effects are partonic interaction with the surrounding matter , the interference between different scattering channels , and effects of phase space distortion due to re - scattering of the decay daughter particles @xcite .",
    "measurement of the @xmath13 meson properties such as mass , width , and yields at various transverse momenta can provide insight for understanding the dynamics of the medium created in heavy - ion collisions .    of particular interest in resonance production",
    "is understanding the role of re - scattering and regeneration effects . due to the short @xmath13 lifetime , the pions and kaons from the @xmath13 that decay at the chemical freeze - out re - scatter with other hadrons .",
    "this would then inhibit the reconstruction of the parent @xmath13 .",
    "however , in the presence of a large population of pions and kaons , these may scatter into a @xmath13 resonance state and thus contribute to the final measured yield  @xcite .",
    "the interplay of these two competing processes becomes relevant for determining the @xmath13 yield in the hadronic medium .",
    "these processes depend on the time interval between chemical ( vanishing inelastic collisions ) and kinetic freeze - out , the source size , and the interaction cross section of the daughter hadrons .",
    "since the @xmath15 interaction cross section  @xcite is larger than the @xmath16 interaction cross section  @xcite , the final observable @xmath13 yield may decrease compared to the primordial yield .",
    "a suppression of the yield ratio such as @xmath17 or @xmath18 is expected in heavy ion collisions compared to the same in @xmath19 collisions at similar collision energies .",
    "this suppression can be used to set a lower limit on the time difference between the chemical and the kinetic freeze - out  @xcite .",
    "the experimental data on the system size , beam energy , and centrality dependence of this suppression can be used to correlate the lifetime of the fireball with its size .",
    "although the measured values of the resonance yield , mean @xmath4 and the elliptic anisotropy coefficient @xmath11 are all expected to be affected by collisional dissociation processes , semi - hard scattering and jet fragmentation , the measurements presented in this paper have been discussed within the framework of re - scattering and regeneration .",
    "the nuclear modification factors such as @xmath20 and @xmath12  @xcite are of vital importance in differentiating between the effect of hadron mass and hadron type ( baryon or meson ) in the particle production . in the intermediate @xmath4 range ( @xmath10 gev/@xmath5 ) ,",
    "@xmath12 of @xmath21 ( a baryon ) and @xmath22 ( a meson ) , as measured by star , are different .",
    "the observed differences are understood as coming from differences in particle type ( the baryon - meson effect ) , in agreement with the quark coalescence model @xcite . because the mass of the @xmath13 meson is comparable to the mass of the @xmath21 baryon , it is interesting to compare the @xmath12 of @xmath13 with those of @xmath22 and @xmath21 to check whether the results confirm to the expectations of the quark coalescence model .",
    "previous measurements of @xmath23 for @xmath13 in au+au collisions at @xmath24 = 200 gev were not precise enough to make such a conclusion  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present a measurement of @xmath12 of the @xmath13 from a higher statistics data set collected in the year 2004 .    in the intermediate @xmath25 range",
    ", the elliptic flow parameter , @xmath26 , for different hadrons shows a deviation from the particle mass ordering as seen in the low @xmath25 regime ( @xmath27 gev/@xmath5 )  @xcite . for identified hadrons , @xmath11 follows a scaling with the number of constituent quarks , @xmath28 , as expected from the quark coalescence model  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath29 meson is expected to follow the scaling law with @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath29 produced via regeneration of kaons and pions during hadronization , on the other hand , would follow the @xmath31 scaling  @xcite .",
    "previous star measurements with a smaller data sample found @xmath32 @xcite and could not conclusively determine the @xmath29 production mechanism",
    ". the additional @xmath11 data presented in this paper , for au+au collisions at 200 gev , may conclusively provide information about the @xmath29 production mechanism in the intermediate @xmath25 range .    in previous star measurements , @xmath29 production",
    "was studied using data from au+au , @xmath33+@xmath33 , and @xmath34+au collisions at 200 gev  @xcite and au+au collisions at 130 gev  @xcite .",
    "the hadronic decay channels used in these analyses were @xmath2 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 . in this paper we present new data on the @xmath25 distribution , @xmath7 , and @xmath6 of @xmath0 in au+au collisions at @xmath37 = 62.4 gev and cu+cu collisions at @xmath37 = 62.4 gev and 200 gev .",
    "the data sample for au+au collisions at 200 gev is 6.5 times larger than previous measurements , allowing us to make more quantitative conclusions from the @xmath11 and @xmath23 measurements .",
    "this broad systematic study , with two different colliding beam energies and two different colliding species , enables us to study the system size and energy dependence of various @xmath0 properties in heavy ion collisions . to reduce statistical errors ,",
    "the samples of @xmath0 and @xmath38 were combined and are referred to as @xmath0 in the present work , unless specified otherwise .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss the detectors used in this analysis and details of the analysis procedure . for more details on the mixed event procedure used to extract the @xmath0 yields , the systematic uncertainty estimation , and the procedure to obtain @xmath11 , we refer the reader to our earlier publications  @xcite .",

    "the primary tracking device within star , the time projection chamber ( tpc )  @xcite , was used for the track reconstruction of the decay daughters of @xmath0 .",
    "the tpc provides particle identification and momentum information of the charged particles by measuring their ionization energy loss , @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "the data were collected with a minimum bias ( mb ) trigger . in au+au collisions",
    "the mb trigger requires a coincidence between two zero degree calorimeters ( zdc )  @xcite .",

    "the minimum bias trigger was a combination of the signals from the zdc and the beam beam counter ( bbc ) .",
