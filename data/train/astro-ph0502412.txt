    "astronomical observations brought important changes in modern cosmology @xcite .",
    "while the type ia supernovae ( snia ) data are most often employed , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) observations and big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) analysis can also be used .",
    "they allow the exotic physics of cosmological models to be checked against the observational data @xcite .",
    "there is an increasing effort to develop some cosmological and astrophysical tools to search for new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the metric - affine gravity ( mag ) cosmological model with the robertson - walker symmetry was investigated by three different groups .",
    "first , it was considered the model with triplet ansatz in vacuum @xcite .",
    "second , it was considered the dilational hyperfluid model @xcite .",
    "third , it was shown that on the level of the field equations the special case of the mag model is equivalent to a model in the weyl - cartan spacetime if we choose a model parameter in the special form ( @xmath2 ) @xcite .",
    "moreover after redefinition of some variables the second and third approach gives the same set of dynamical equations .",
    "the analysis of constraints on parameters in the mag model can be addressed in all three approach , but we adopt the last one proposed by puetzfeld and chen @xcite .    note that in the model with dust matter on the brane , apart from dark radiation which scales like @xmath3 , there is a correction of the type @xmath1 to the einstein equations on the brane which arise from the influence of a bulk geometry @xcite .",
    "the term scaling like @xmath1 also appears in the friedmann - robertson - walker model with spinning fluid @xcite .",
    "it is possible to establish formally the one to one correspondence between the mag model and either the randall - sundrum brane model when positive values of the non - riemannian contribution to effective energy is admitted or the spinning fluid filled cosmology when this contribution is negative .",
    "however , if one takes the pure randall - sundrum type model then there is a constraint on the brane tension parameter coming from the theory itself .",
    "the brane tension parameter is not less than about ( @xmath4 gev)@xmath5 .",
    "the mag model is free from such a theoretical constraint .    in our further discussion",
    "we examine the flat models which is motivated by the cmb wmap observations @xcite and consider the following formula for the friedmann first integral @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the hubble function , @xmath8 is the cosmological time , @xmath9 is the scale factor , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath0 are the density parameters for dust matter , the cosmological constant and fictitious fluid which mimics `` non - riemannian effects '' , respectively .",
    "their values in the present epoch are marked by the index `` 0 '' .",
    "all density parameters satisfy the constraint condition @xmath12 the density parameter for the fictitious fluid is defined as @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 the sign of the parameter @xmath15 is undetermined and it can assume both positive and negative values .",
    "let us start from the reestimation of the models parameters by using the latest sample of snia data @xcite .",
    "the motivation to study the sn constraint is to find the best estimation available from the latest data which gives the narrowest constraint for this method . in the next sections we compare it with constraints obtained from other methods .",
    "riess et al.s sample contains 157 type ia supernovae @xcite .",
    "we consider the flat model with and without priors on the @xmath0 and @xmath10 .",
    "we assume that the former can be of any value or only nonnegative , and the latter is nonnegative or equal @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "we estimate the best fits of the model parameters ( table  [ tab:1 ] ) .",
    "additionally we find the maximum likelihood estimates with the errors at @xmath17 level ( table  [ tab:2 ] ) .",
    ".best fit estimation of the model parameters from the snia data [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     if we choose the @xmath18 km / s mpc then we obtain the agreement with the observation of the location of the first peak for three non - zero values of the parameter @xmath0 . as it is shown on figure  [ fig:2 ]",
    "there are two positive and one negative values of this parameter for which the mag model is admissible .",
    "all these distinguished values of @xmath0 are in agreement with the result obtained from snia because the @xmath17 confidence interval for this parameter obtained from the snia data contains these three points . while the snia estimations give the possibility that @xmath0 is equal zero , the cmb calculations seem to exclude this case because the zero value of @xmath0 requires the first peak location at @xmath19 .",
    "if we choose the @xmath20 km / s mpc than one of positive values of @xmath0 move to zero , while the second one move a little to the right .",
    "we also calculated the age of the universe in the mag model .",
    "we find that the difference in the age of the universe is smaller than 1 mln years for all three values of @xmath0 . assuming that @xmath21 the age of the universe is @xmath22 gyr for @xmath23 km / s mpc , and @xmath24 gyr for @xmath25 km / s mpc .",
    "the globular cluster analysis indicated that the age of the universe is @xmath26 gyr @xcite .",

    "it is well known that the big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) is the very well tested area of cosmology and does not allow for any significant deviation from the standard expansion law apart from very early times ( i.e. , before the onset of bbn ) .",
    "the prediction of standard bbn is in well agreement with observations of abundance of light elements .",
    "therefore , all nonstandard terms added to the friedmann equation should give only negligible small modifications during the bbn epoch to have the nucleosynthesis process unchanged .",
    "in our opinion the consistency with bbn is a crucial issue in the mag models where the nonstandard term @xmath1 in the friedmann equation is added ( see also discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "this additional term scales like @xmath27 .",
    "it is clear that such a term has either accelerated ( @xmath28 ) or decelerated ( @xmath29 ) impact on the universe expansion .",
    "going backwards in time this term would become dominant at some redshift .",
    "if it would happen before the bbn epoch , the radiation domination would never occur and the all bbn predictions would be lost .",
    "the domination of the fictitious fluid @xmath30 should end before the bbn epoch starts otherwise the nucleosynthesis process would be dramatically modified .",
    "if we assume that the bbn result are preserved in the mag models we obtain another constraint on the amount of @xmath0 .",
    "let us assume that the model modification is negligible small during the bbn epoch and the nucleosynthesis process is unchanged .",
    "it means that the contribution of the mag term @xmath0 can not dominate over the radiation term @xmath31 before the beginning of bbn ( @xmath32 ) @xmath33    the values of @xmath34 obtained as best fits in the snia data analysis as well as the smallest nonzero value of @xmath35 calculated in the cmb analysis are unrealistic in the light of the above result .",
    "if we take into consideration the maximum likelihood analysis of snia data we have the possibility that the value of @xmath0 is lower than @xmath36 in the @xmath17 confidence interval . in the case of the cmb analysis only the value of the hubble constant close to @xmath37 km / s mpc gives the zero or close to zero value of @xmath0 .",
    "the paper discusses observational constraint on `` energy contributions '' arising in certain cosmological models based on mag .",
    "in particular it is focused on the nonstandard term @xmath1 .",
    "we test this model against the snia data , the location of the peaks of the cmb power spectrum , and constraints from the bbn .",
    "the mag model fits well to snia data and the estimations give the amount of fluid @xmath0 to be order of magnitude @xmath38 , and the hubble constant is close to @xmath39 km / s mpc .",
    "let us note that these results are compatible with constraints from friib radio galaxies and x - ray gas mass fractions @xcite .",
    "the cmb analysis gives that the hubble constant is @xmath37 km / s mpc which gives the too low age of the universe in comparison with the age of globular clusters .",
    "taking lower value of the hubble constant obtained from snia estimation resolves the problem of the age .",
    "however , the location of the first peak shifts to the right and is in conflict with the observed location .",
    "the introducing of the non - riemannian structure of the underlying spacetime moves the location of the first peak back and this mag model agrees with the cmb observations .",
    "the analysis of the cmb in this model can not distinguish the character of the fictitious fluid and we do not know whether the parameter @xmath0 is positive or negative .",
    "the absolute values of @xmath0 obtained in the mag model from the cmb analysis with @xmath40 seems to be too large in comparison to the limit obtained from the bbn analysis . using the bbn analysis we pointed out that the mag part of the energy density to its present density parameter is of order @xmath41 .",
    "the limit of this order leads to the conclusion that the mag model is virtually ruled out .",
    "however , we must remember that we insist that the mag model does not change the physics during and after the bbn epoch . in this context , the merit of the snia analysis is its independency from any assumption on physical processes in the early universe ."
