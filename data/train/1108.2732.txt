    "the analysis and interpretation of ongoing and future neutrino oscillation experiments strongly rely on the nuclear modeling for describing the interaction of neutrinos and anti - neutrinos with the detector .",
    "moreover , neutrino - nucleus scattering has recently become a matter of debate in connection with the possibility of extracting information on the nucleon axial mass .",
    "specifically , the data on muon neutrino charged - current quasielastic ( ccqe ) cross sections obtained by the miniboone collaboration  @xcite are substantially underestimated by the relativistic fermi gas ( rfg ) prediction .",
    "this has been ascribed either to effects in the elementary neutrino - nucleon interaction , or to nuclear effects .",
    "the most poorly known ingredient of the single nucleon cross section is the cutoff parameter @xmath0 employed in the dipole prescription for the axial form factor of the nucleon , which can be extracted from @xmath1 and @xmath2 scattering off hydrogen and deuterium and from charged pion electroproduction .",
    "if @xmath0 is kept as a free parameter in the rfg calculation , a best fit of the miniboone data yields a value of the order of 1.35 gev / c@xmath3 , much larger than the average value @xmath4 gev / c@xmath3 extracted from the ( anti)neutrino world data  @xcite .",
    "this should be taken more as an indication of incompleteness of the theoretical description of the data based upon the rfg , rather than as a true indication for a larger axial mass .",
    "indeed it is well - known from comparisons with electron scattering data that the rfg model is too crude to account for the nuclear dynamics .",
    "hence it is crucial to explore more sophisticated nuclear models before drawing conclusions on the value of @xmath0 .",
    "several calculations have been recently performed and applied to neutrino reactions .",
    "these include , besides the approach that will be presented here , models based on nuclear spectral functions  @xcite , relativistic independent particle models  @xcite , relativistic green function approaches  @xcite , models including nn correlations  @xcite , coupled - channel transport models  @xcite , rpa calculations  @xcite and models including multinucleon knock - out  @xcite .",
    "the difference between the predictions of the above models can be large due to the different treatment of both initial and final state interactions . as a general trend ,",
    "the models based on impulse approximation , where the neutrino is supposed to scatter off a single nucleon inside the nucleus , tend to underestimate the miniboone data , while a sizable increase of the cross section is obtained when two - particle - two - hole ( 2p-2h ) mechanisms are included in the calculations .",
    "furthermore , a recent calculation performed within the relativistic green function ( rgf ) framework has shown that at this kinematics the results strongly depend on the phenomenological optical potential used to describe the final state interaction between the ejected nucleon and the residual nucleus  @xcite . with an appropriate choice of the optical potential",
    "the rgf model can reproduce the miniboone data without the need of modifying the axial mass ( see giusti s contribution to this volume  @xcite ) .",
    "the kinematics of the miniboone experiment , where the neutrino flux spans a wide range of energies reaching values as high as 3 gev , demands relativity as an essential ingredient .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .  1 , where the relativistic and non - relativistic fermi gas results for the ccqe double differential cross section of 1 gev muon neutrinos on @xmath5 are shown as a function of the outgoing muon momentum and for two values of the muon scattering angle",
    ". the relativistic effects , which affect both the kinematics and the dynamics of the problem , have been shown to be relevant even at moderate momentum and energy transfers  @xcite .",

    "in spite of its simplicity , the rfg has the merit of incorporating an exact relativistic treatment , fulfilling the fundamental properties of lorentz covariance and gauge invariance .",
    "however , it badly fails to reproduce the electron scattering data , in particular when it is compared with the rosenbluth - separated longitudinal and transverse responses .",
    "comparison with electron scattering data must be a guiding principle in selecting reliable models for neutrino reactions .",
    "a strong constraint in this connection is represented by the `` superscaling '' analysis of the world inclusive @xmath7 data : in refs .",
    "@xcite it has been proved that , for sufficiently large momentum transfers , the reduced cross section ( namely the double differential cross section divided by the appropriate single nucleon factors ) , when represented versus the scaling variable @xmath8  @xcite , is largely independent of the momentum transfer ( first - kind scaling ) and of the nuclear target ( second - kind scaling ) . the simultaneous occurrence of the two kinds of scaling is called susperscaling . moreover , from the experimental longitudinal response a phenomenological quasielastic scaling function has been extracted that shows a clear asymmetry with respect to the quasielastic peak ( qep ) with a long tail extended to positive values of the scaling variable , i.e. , larger energy transfers . on the contrary the rfg model , as well as",
    "most models based on impulse approximation , give a symmetric superscaling function with a maximum value 20 - 30% higher than the data  @xcite .    in this contribution , after recalling the basic formalism for ccqe reactions and their connection with electron scattering , we shall illustrate two models which provide good agreement with the above properties of electron scattering data : one of them , the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model , comes from microscopic many - body theory , the other , the superscaling approximation ( susa ) model , is extracted from @xmath7 phenomenology .",
    "we shall then include the contribution of 2p-2h excitations in the susa model and finally compare our results with the miniboone double differential , single differential and total cross sections .",

    "charged current quasielastic muonic neutrino scattering @xmath9 off nuclei is very closely related to quasielastic inclusive electron scattering @xmath7 .",

    "the probe interacts with the nucleus via the weak force , in the latter the interaction is ( dominantly ) electromagnetic .",
    "while the weak vector current is related to the electromagnetic one via the cvc theorem , the axial current gives rise to a more complex structure of the cross sections , with new response functions which can not be related to the electromagnetic ones . as a consequence , while in electron scattering the double - differential cross section can be expressed in terms of two response functions , longitudinal and transverse with respect to three - momentum carried by the virtual photon , for the ccqe process it can be written according to a rosenbluth - like decomposition as  @xcite @xmath10_{e_\\nu } = \\sigma_0 \\left [ { \\hat v}_{l } r_l + { \\hat v}_t r_t + { \\hat v}_{t^\\prime } r_{t^\\prime } \\right ] , \\label{eq : d2s}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the muon kinetic energy and scattering angle , @xmath13 is the incident neutrino energy , @xmath14 is the elementary cross section , @xmath15 are kinematic factors and @xmath16 are the nuclear response functions , the indices @xmath17 referring to longitudinal , transverse , transverse - axial , components of the nuclear current , respectively . the expression ( [ eq : d2s ] )",

    "this is , for instance , the situation at the most forward scattering angles , where a significant contribution in the cross section comes from very low - lying excitations in nuclei  @xcite , as illustrated in fig .  3 : here",
    "the double differential cross section is evaluated in the susa model ( see later ) at the miniboone kinematics and the lowest angular bin and compared with the result obtained by excluding the energy transfers lower than 50 mev from the flux - integral ( [ eq : fluxint ] ) .",

    "+ it appears that at these angles 30 - 40% of the cross section corresponds to very low energy transfers , where collective effects dominate .",
    "moreover , processes involving meson exchange currents ( mec ) , which can excite both one - particle - one - hole ( 1p1h ) and two - particle - two - hole ( 2p-2h ) states via the exchange of a virtual meson , should also be taken into account , since they lead to final states where no pions are present , classified as `` quasielastic '' in the miniboone experiment .",
    "in this section we briefly outline the main ingredients of the rmf and susa model and we illustrate our calculation of the contribution of 2p-2h meson exchange currents .      in the rmf model a fully relativistic description of both the kinematics and the dynamics of the process is incorporated .",
    "details on the rmf model applied to inclusive qe electron and ccqe neutrino reactions can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we simply recall that the weak response functions are given by taking the appropriate components of the weak hadronic tensor , constructed from the single - nucleon current matrix elements @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are relativistic bound - state and scattering wave functions , respectively , and @xmath33 is the relativistic one - body current operator modeling the coupling between the virtual @xmath34-boson and a nucleon .",
    "the bound nucleon states are described as self - consistent dirac - hartree solutions , derived by using a lagrangian containing @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 mesons  @xcite .",
    "the outgoing nucleon wave function is computed by using the same relativistic mean field ( scalar and vector energy - independent potentials ) employed in the initial state and incorporates the final state interactions ( fsi ) between the ejected proton and the residual nucleus .",
    "the rmf model successfully reproduces the scaling behaviour of inclusive qe @xmath7 processes and , more importantly , it gives rise to a superscaling function with a significant asymmetry , namely , in complete accord with data  @xcite .",
    "this is a peculiar property associated to the consistent treatment of initial and final state interactions .",
    "it has been shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that other versions of the rmf model , which deal with the fsi through a real relativistic optical potential , are not capable of reproducing the asymmetry of the scaling function .",
    "moreover , contrary to most other models based on impulse approximation , where scaling of the zeroth kind - namely the equality of the longitudinal and transverse scaling functions - occurs , the rmf model provides @xmath21 and @xmath23 scaling functions which differ by typically @xmath38 , the t one being larger .",
    "this agrees with the analysis @xcite of the existing @xmath39 separated data , which has shown that , after removing inelastic contributions and two - particle - emission effects , the purely nucleonic transverse scaling function is significantly larger than the longitudinal one .",
    "the susa model is based on the phenomenological superscaling function extracted from the world data on quasielastic electron scattering  @xcite .",
    "the model has been extended to the @xmath40-resonance region in ref .",
    "@xcite and to neutral current scattering in ref .",
    "@xcite , but here we restrict our attention to the quasielastic charged current case .    assuming the scaling function @xmath41 extracted from @xmath7 data to be universal , i.e. , valid for electromagnetic and weak interactions , in  @xcite ccqe neutrino - nucleus cross sections have been evaluated by multiplying @xmath41 by the corresponding elementary weak cross section .",
    "thus in the susa approach all the nuclear responses in ( [ eq : d2s ] ) are expressed as follows @xmath42 where @xmath43 are the elementary lepton - nucleon responses , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the fermi energy and momentum , @xmath46 is the number of nucleons ( neutrons in the @xmath6ccqe case ) and @xmath47 in the universal superscaling function , depending only on the scaling variable @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "the susa approach provides nuclear - model - independent neutrino - nucleus cross sections and reproduces the longitudinal electron data by construction . however , its reliability rests on some basic assumptions .",
    "first , it assumes that the scaling function - extracted from _",
    "@xmath7 data - is appropriate for all of the weak responses involved in neutrino scattering ( charge - charge , charge - longitudinal , longitudinal - longitudinal , transverse and axial ) , and is independent of the vector or axial nature of the nuclear current entering the hadronic tensor . in particular",
    "it assumes the equality of the longitudinal and transverse scaling functions ( scaling of the zeroth kind ) , which , as mentioned before , has been shown to be violated both by experiment and by some microscopic models , for example relativistic mean field theory .",
    "second , the charged - current neutrino responses are purely isovector , whereas the electromagnetic ones contain both isoscalar and isovector components and the former involve axial - vector as well as vector responses .",
    "one then has to invoke a further kind of scaling , namely the independence of the scaling function of the choice of isospin channel  so - called scaling of the third kind .",
    "finally , the susa approach neglects violations of scaling of first and second kinds .",
    "these are known to be important at energies above the qe peak and to reside mainly in the transverse channel , being associated to effects which go beyond the impulse approximation : inelastic scattering , meson - exchange currents and the associated correlations needed to conserve the vector current .",
    "the inclusion of these contributions in the susa model is discussed in the next paragraph .",
    "meson exchange currents are two - body currents carried by a virtual meson which is exchanged between two nucleons in the nucleus .",
    "they are represented by the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : mec ] , where the external lines correspond to the virtual boson ( @xmath48 or @xmath34 ) and the dashed lines to the exchanged meson : in our approach we only consider the pion , which is believed to give the dominant contribution in the quasielastic regime .",
    "the thick lines in diagrams ( d)-(g ) represent the propagation of a @xmath40-resonance .",
    "the explicit relativistic expressions for the current matrix elements can be found , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite .     two - body meson - exchange currents .",
    "( a ) and ( b ) : `` contact '' , or `` seagull '' diagram ; ( c ) : `` pion - in - flight '' diagram ; ( d)-(g ) : `` @xmath40-mec '' diagram . ]",
    "being two - body currents , the mec can excite both one - particle one - hole ( 1p-1h ) and two - particle two - hole ( 2p-2h ) states . in the 1p-1h sector",
    ", mec studies of electromagnetic @xmath49 process have been performed for low - to - intermediate momentum transfers ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) , showing a small reduction of the total response at the quasielastic peak , mainly due to diagrams involving the electroexcitation of the @xmath40 resonance .",
    "however in a perturbative scheme where all the diagrams containing one and only one pionic line are retained , the mec are not the only diagrams arising , but pionic correlation contributions , where the virtual boson is attached to one of the two interacting nucleons , should also be considered .",
    "these are represented by the same diagrams as in fig .",
    "[ fig : mec](d)-(g ) , where now the thick lines are nucleon propagators . only when all the diagrams are taken into account gauge invariance",
    "is fulfilled and the full two - body current is conserved .",
    "correlation diagrams have been shown to roughly compensate the pure mec contribution  @xcite , so that in first approximation we can neglect the 1p-1h sector and restrict our attention to 2p-2h final states .",
    "the contribution to the inclusive electron scattering cross section arising from two - nucleon emission via meson exchange current interactions was first calculated in the fermi gas model in refs .",
    "@xcite , where sizable effects were found at large energy transfers . in these references a non - relativistic reduction of the currents was performed , while fully relativistic calculations have been developed more recently in refs .",
    "it has been found that the mec give a significant positive contribution which leads to a partial filling of the `` dip '' between the quasielastic peak and the analogous peak associated with the excitation of the @xmath40 resonance .",
    "moreover , the mec have been shown to break scaling of both first and second kinds  @xcite .",
    "here we use the fully relativistic model of @xcite , where all the mec many - body diagrams containing two pionic lines that contribute to the electromagnetic 2p-2h transverse response were taken into account .",
    "similar results for the 2p-2h mec were obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the correlation diagrams were also included .    in order to apply the model to neutrino scattering",
    ", we observe that in lowest order the 2p2h sector is not directly reachable for the axial - vector matrix elements .",
    "hence the mec affect only the transverse polar vector response , @xmath50 .",
    "note that , at variance with the 1p-1h sector , where the contribution of the mec diagrams originates from the interference between 1-body and 2-body amplitudes and has therefore no definite sign ( in fact it turns out to be negative due to the dominance of the diagrams involving the @xmath40 ) , the 2p-2h contribution of mec to the nuclear responses is the square of an amplitude , hence it is positive by definition .",
    "therefore the net effect of 2p-2h mec to neutrino scattering is to increase the transverse vector response function , as will be illustrated in the next section .",
    "in this section we present the predictions of the above models and their comparison with the miniboone data .",
    "more results can be found in refs .",

    "it appears that the susa predictions systematically underestimate the experimental cross section , the discrepancy being larger at high scattering angle and low muon kinetic energy .",
    "the inclusion of 2p-2h mec tends to improve the agreement with the data at low angles , but it is not sufficient to account for the discrepancy at higher angles .",
    "the rmf calculation , which , as already mentioned , incorporates violations of scaling of the zeroth kind with a substantial enhancement of the vector transverse response , yields cross sections which are in general larger than the susa ones . in particular , in the region close to the peak in the cross section , the rmf result becomes larger than the one obtained with susa+mec .",
    "furthermore , the rmf does better than susa in fitting the shape of the experimental curves versus both the scattering angle and the muon energy : this is partly due to the fact that the rmf is better describing the low - energy excitation region whereas the susa model has no predictive power at very low angles , where the cross section is dominated by low excitation energies and the superscaling ideas are not supposed to apply .    concerning the susa+mec results , a possible explanation of the theory / data disagreement is the fact that , as already mentioned , a fully consistent treatment of two - body currents should take into account not only the genuine mec contributions , but also the correlation diagrams that are necessary in order to preserve the gauge invariance of the theory",
    "this , however , is not an easy task because in an infinite system like the rfg the correlation diagrams give rise to divergences which need to be regularized  @xcite .",
    "the divergences arise from a double pole in some of the diagrams , associated to the presence of on - shell nucleon propagators .",

    ". however the comparison with the double differential experimental cross section reveals some differences between the two models , which are washed out by the integration .",
    "indeed the rmf , although being lower than the data , reproduces better the slopes of the cross section versus the muon energy and scattering angle .",
    "this is essentially due to the enhancement of the transverse response , which arises from the self - consistent mean field approach of rmf ( in particular from the consistent treatment of initial and final state interactions ) and is absent in the superscaling approach .",
    "2 .   in relativistic or semi - relativistic models",
    "final state interactions have been shown to play an essential role for reproducing the shape and size of the electromagnetic response  @xcite and can not be neglected , in our scheme , in the study of neutrino interactions .",
    "the effect of final state interactions in the susa and rmf models is to lower the cross section , giving a discrepancy with the data larger than the rfg .",
    "3 .   in the transverse channel",
    ", the analysis of @xmath7 data points to the importance of meson - exchange currents which , through the excitation of two - particle - two - hole states , are partially responsible of filling the `` dip '' region between the qe and @xmath40 peaks .",
    "the 2p-2h mec can be even more relevant in the ccqe process , where `` quasielastic '' implies simply that no pions are present in the final state but , due to the large energy region spanned by the neutrino flux , processes involving the exchange of virtual pions can give a sizable contribution .",
    "in fact the inclusion of 2p-2h mec contributions yields larger cross sections and accordingly better agreement with the data , although the theoretical curves still lie below the data at high angles and low muon energy .",

    "although our scope here is not to extract a value for the axial mass of the nucleon , but rather to understand which nuclear effects are effectively accounted for by a large axial cutoff parameter , let us mention that a best fit of the rmf and susa results to the miniboone experimental cross section gives an effective axial mass @xmath55 1.5 gev / c@xmath3 and values in the range @xmath56 gev / c@xmath3 yield results compatible with the miniboone data within the experimental errors .",
    "a similar analysis in the model including the 2p-2h contribution will be possible only when the above mentioned correlation diagrams will be consistently evaluated  @xcite .",

    "<S> after a short review of the recent developments in studies of neutrino - nucleus interactions , the predictions for double - differential and integrated charged current - induced quasielastic cross sections are presented within two different relativistic approaches : one is the so - called susa method , based on the superscaling behavior exhibited by electron scattering data ; the other is a microscopic model based on relativistic mean field theory , and incorporating final - state interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the role played by the meson - exchange currents in the two - particle two - hole sector is explored and the results are compared with the recent miniboone data . </S>"
