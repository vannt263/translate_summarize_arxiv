    "one of the most recognizable features of galaxies along the hubble sequence ( loose definition , including not only morphological type but also gas content , mass , bar structure and dynamical environment ) is the wide range in young stellar content and star formation activity .",
    "understanding its physical nature and origin of the variation in stellar content are fundamental to understand evolution of galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter k98 ) . star formation rate ( sfr ) can be used to compare with those distant galaxies at cosmological lookback times , and extrapolate the future timescales for star formation in galaxies by combining with hi and co measurements @xcite .",
    "moreover , star formation activity is usually correlated with cold gas and stars in galaxies : stars continuously produce mass , energy and metals during their evolution processes , and return them to galactic medium ( gas ) , affecting the status of the next generation of stars .",
    "sfr carries the information on the evolution of galaxies .",
    "therefore , it is important to determine sfr and its variation with hubble type ( loose definition ) and environment , which can help us to understand the evolution of galaxies .",
    "the commonly used sfr tracers include the flux of h@xmath11 nebular recombination line , the ultraviolet ( uv ) continuum flux , the flux of [ oii]@xmath23727 forbidden - line doublet and far infra - red ( fir ) continuum flux ( k98 ) .",
    "these sfr tracers are more or less correlated with the uv passband .    *",
    "first , the uv flux is directly tied to the photospheric emission of the young stellar population ( sp ) . *",
    "second , the integrated luminosity of galaxy shortward of the lyman limit ( far - uv ) can ionize the hydrogen in the nebula and produce the recombination lines ( such as h@xmath11 , h@xmath12 , and so on ) .",
    "thus the luminosities of these lines can be used to trace sfr . *",
    "third , the luminosity of the strong [ oii]@xmath23727 forbidden - line doublet is often empirically obtained through the h@xmath11 luminosity , although it is not coupled to the ionizing luminosity and the excitation of this line is sensitive to abundance and the ionization state of the gas . *",
    "finally , the last sfr trace , the fir luminosity , is also correlated with the uv passband .",
    "the interstellar dust can absorb the bolometric luminosity of galaxy and re - emit it in the thermal ir passband . the absorption cross section of the dust peaks in the uv passband , and , since the uv flux is considered as a tracer of young sp , the fir luminosity can also diagnose sfr .",
    "furthermore , the last three diagnostics and the corresponding calibrations of sfr are correlated with the uv flux . since in our previous studies",
    ", we found that the inclusion of binary interactions in evolutionary population synthesis ( eps ) models can raise the uv flux by @xmath7 2 - 3 magnitudes for sp at an age of @xmath13gyr @xcite , in this study we will discuss the effect of binary interactions on these calibrations .    the outline of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the used eps models and algorithm . in section 3",
    "we overview the previous results about sfr calibrations , and the advantages and disadvantages of these sfr tracers . in section 4",
    "we give the effect of binary interactions on these sfr calibrations . in section 5",
