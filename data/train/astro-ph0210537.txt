    "the chemical elements were created by nuclear fusion reactions in the hot interiors of remote and long - vanished stars over many billions of years @xcite .",
    "thus , nuclear reaction rates are at the heart of nuclear astrophysics : they influence sensitively the nucleosynthesis of the elements in the earliest stages of the universe and in all the objects formed thereafter , and they control the associated energy generation , neutrino luminosity and evolution of stars .",
    "a good knowledge of their rates is essential for understanding this broad picture .",
    "nuclear reactions in static stellar burning phases occur at energies far below the coulomb barrier . due to the steep drop of the cross section @xmath0 at sub - barrier energies",
    ", it becomes increasingly difficult to measure it as the energy @xmath1 is lowered .",
    "generally , stellar fusion rates are obtained by extrapolating laboratory data taken at energies significantly larger than those relevant to stellar interiors . obviously such an  extrapolation into the unknown",
    "\" can lead to considerable uncertainty . in the last twenty years a significant effort has been devoted to the experimental exploration of the lowest energies and new approaches have been developed so as to reduce the uncertainties in the extrapolations .",
    "in particular , the installation of an accelerator facility in the underground laboratory at lngs @xcite has allowed the @xmath2 measurement of @xmath3 down to its solar gamow peak , @xmath4 kev @xcite so that for this reaction no extrapolation is needed anymore .    as experiments have moved well down into the sub - barrier region , the screening effect of atomic electrons has become relevant @xcite .",
    "with respect to the bare nuclei case , the coulomb repulsion is diminished , the tunneling distance @xmath5 is reduced , and the fusion probability , which depends exponentially on @xmath5 , is enhanced .",
    "the electron effect on the reaction can be seen as a transfer of energy @xmath6 ( the screening potential energy ) from the electronic to the translational degrees of freedom . for each collision energy @xmath1",
    ", one has an effective energy @xmath7 and a cross section enhancement : @xmath8    the screening potential energy @xmath6 is easily estimated in two limiting cases @xcite : in the sudden limit , when the relative velocity @xmath9 of the nuclei is larger than the typical electron velocity @xmath10 : the electron wave function during the nuclear collision is frozen at the initial value @xmath11 and the energy transferred from electrons to the nuclei is thus @xmath12 where here and in the following the index 1 ( 2 ) denotes the projectile ( target ) nucleus and a sum over the electrons is understood . in the adiabatic limit ,",
    "i.e. when @xmath13 : electrons follow adiabatically the nuclear motion and at any internuclear distance the electron wave function @xmath14 corresponds to an energy eigenstate calculated for fixed nuclei .",
    "as the nuclei approach distances smaller than each atomic radius , @xmath14 tends to the united atom ( i.e. with nuclear charge @xmath15 ) limit , @xmath16 .",
    "the kinetic energy gained by the colliding nuclei is thus @xmath17 where @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) is the electron energy of the isolated ( united ) atom in the corresponding states .",
    "we like to stress a few important features :    _ i ) _ screening potential energies , which are in the range 10100 ev , are definitely smaller than the practical collision energies ( 1100 kev ) , nevertheless they can produce appreciable fusion enhancements due to the exponential dependence of the cross section .    _",
    "ii ) _ in the adiabatic limit the electron energy assumes the lowest value consistent with quantum mechanics . due to energy conservation , the energy transfer to the nuclear motion is thus maximal in this case ( @xmath20 ) and the observed cross section enhancement should not exceed that calculated by using the adiabatic potential : @xmath21    _ iii ) _ the enhancement factors which have been measured are generally larger than expected .",
    "a summary of the available results is presented in table [ tabrolf ] .",
    "the general trend is that the enhancement factors exceed the adiabatic limit .",
    "recent measurement of @xmath22 with deuterium implanted in metals @xcite have shown enhancements of the cross sections with respect to the bare nuclei case by factors of order unity , whereas one expects a few percent effect .",
    "in other words , if one derives an `` experimental '' potential energy @xmath23 from a fit of experimental data according to eq .",
    "( [ effe ] ) , the resulting values significantly exceed the adiabatic limit @xmath24 . in the case of deuterium implanted in metals , values as high as @xmath25 ev",
    "have been found @xcite , at least an order of magnitude larger than the expected atomic value @xmath26 .",
    "several theoretical investigations have resulted in a better understanding of small effects in low energy nuclear reactions , but have not provided an explanation of this puzzling picture .    _",
    "iv ) _ dynamical calculations of electron screening for finite values of the relative velocity show a smooth interpolation between the extreme adiabatic and sudden limits @xcite . in fact",
    ", one can not exceed the value obtained in the adiabatic approximation because the dynamical calculation includes atomic excitations which reduce the energy transferred from the electronic binding to the relative motion .",
    "_ v ) _ the effects of vacuum polarization @xcite , relativity , bremmstrahlung and atomic polarization @xcite have been studied .",
    "vacuum polarization becomes relevant when the minimal approach distance is close to the electron compton wavelength but it has an anti - screening effect , corresponding to the fact that in qed the effective charge increases at short distances .",
    "all these effects can not account for the anomalous enhancements .",
    "although one can not exclude some experimental effect , e.g. a ( systematic ) overestimate of the stopping power , the general trend is that most reactions exhibit an anomalous high enhanchement .",
    "phenomenologically , this corresponds to an unexplained collision energy increase in the range of 100 ev .",
    "actually , the anomalous experimental values @xmath23 look too large to be related with atomic , molecular or crystal energies .",
    "some other processes , involving the much smaller energies available in the target , should mimic the large experimental values of u. as an example , if the projectile approaches a target nucleus which is moving against it with energy @xmath27 , the collision energy is increased by an amount : @xmath28 for @xmath29 reactions at ( nominal ) collision energy @xmath30  kev , a target energy @xmath31 ev is sufficient for producing @xmath32  ev .",
    "generally , one expects that opposite motions of the target nuclei are equally possible . even in this case , however , the effect is not washed out : due to the strong nonlinearity of the fusion cross section the reaction probability is much larger for those nuclei which are moving against the projectile .    in this spirit , we shall consider processes associated with the energy spread of the colliding nuclei .",
    "these processes generally lead to an enhancement of the fusion rate , for the reasons just outlined .    in the next section",
    "we shall first consider the thermal motion of the target nuclei .",
    "for this example , we shall derive an expression for the enhancement factor on physical grounds and then we shall outline the effects of an energy spread for the extraction of the astrophysical s - factor from experimental data .",
    "the treatment is generalized in sect .",
    "[ general ] and in sect .",
    "[ appli ] it is applied to study energy spreads due to motion of the nuclei inside atoms , molecules and crystals . beam energy width and straggling are also considered .    in summary",
    ", all the effects turn out to be too tiny to explain the observed anomalous enhancements .",
    "nevertheless , they have to be considered in analyzing the data , particularly in future experiments at still lower energies .",
    "in this section we consider the effects of thermal motion of the target nuclei .",
    "we shall make several simplifications , in order to elucidate the main physical ingredients . in this way we shall derive a simple expression for the enhancement factor on physical grounds .",
    "essentially , we shall concentrate on the exponential factor of the fusion cross section , neglecting the energy dependence of the pre - exponential factors , and we shall only consider the effect of the target motion in the direction of the incoming particle , neglecting the transverse motion . when these simplifications are removed the result is essentially confirmed : see the more general treatment of sect .",
    "[ general ] .",
    "the fusion cross section at energies well below the coulomb barrier is generally written as : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the collision energy , @xmath35 is the reduced mass , @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the astrophysical s - factor . and thus @xmath38 . ]",
    "the cross section is more conveniently expressed in terms of the relative velocity of the colliding nuclei @xmath39 : @xmath40 at energies well below the coulomb barrier , @xmath41 , the main dependence is through the exponential factor , so we shall treat the pre - exponential term as a constant : @xmath42    we consider a projectile nucleus with fixed velocity @xmath43 impinging against a target where the nuclei have a thermal distribution of velocity . since the target nucleus velocity @xmath44 is generally much smaller than @xmath45 , one can expand @xmath46 and retain the first non vanishing term : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the target velocity projection over the @xmath43-direction .    the enhancement factor with respect to the fixed target case , @xmath49 ,",
    "is thus calculated by averaging @xmath50 over the @xmath48 distribution : @xmath51 where @xmath52 .",
    "the integral @xmath53 is easily evaluated by using a ( saddle point ) trick similar to that used by gamow for evaluating stellar burning rates .",
    "the product of the gaussian and the exponential functions ( fig.[figgamow ] ) results in an ( approximately ) gaussian with the same width , centered at @xmath54 , its height giving the enhancement factor : @xmath55    concerning this equation , which is the main result of the paper , several comments are needed :    _ i ) _ since the term in parenthesis in eq .",
    "( [ fthermal ] ) is positive , one has @xmath56 , i.e. the energy spread always results in a cross section enhancement .",
    "one can not ignore the target velocity distribution for the calculation of the reaction yield since nuclei moving towards the projectile have a larger weight in the cross section .",
    "_ ii ) _ the main contribution to the cross section comes from target nuclei with velocity close to @xmath57 . when @xmath58 , this velocity is larger than the typical thermal velocity @xmath59 .",
    "this result is equivalent to the gamow peak energy in stars , which is significantly higher than the thermal energy @xmath60 . in terms of the energy , by putting @xmath61 in eq .",

    "a 10% enhancement would correspond to @xmath73 ev .    _",
    "v ) _ the same method can be extended to other motions of the target nuclei , provided that the velocity distribution is approximately gaussian and if other interactions of the nuclei during the collision are neglected ( sudden approximation ) .",
    "one has to replace @xmath74 in eq .",
    "( [ fthermal ] ) with the appropriate average velocity associated with the motion under investigation .",
    "vibrations of the target nucleus inside a molecule or a crystal lattice can be treated in this way , since the vibrational times are much longer than the collision times . these and other similar effects will be discussed in sect .",
    "[ appli ] .    _",
    "vi ) _ from the discussion presented above one gets an easy procedure to correct the experimental results for taking into account the effect of an energy spread .",

    ", the effect of the energy spread translates into both a cross section enhancement and an energy enhancement .",
    "in this section we shall provide a more general discussion of the energy spread effects , which will substantially confirm eq .",
    "( [ fthermal ] ) and which can be applied to a rather large class of processes .",
    "the main assumption is that the projectile motion is fast in comparison with the other motions , so that the sudden approximation can be used .",
    "let us consider a projectile with velocity @xmath80 impinging onto a thin target ( density @xmath81 and thickness @xmath82 ) , where energy loss can be neglected .",
    "the interaction probability @xmath83 is the product of the interaction probability per unit time @xmath84 with the time spent in the target , @xmath85 . the measured counting rate @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the beam current and @xmath88 is the detector efficiency , is thus : @xmath89 as in stars , the quantity which is physically relevant is thus @xmath90 , where the average has to be taken over the target nuclei velocity distribution .",
    "this distribution is due to the coupling with other degrees of freedom . inside an atom ( or a molecule , or a crystal )",
    "the nucleus is vibrating , its motion is altered by the arrival of the projectile nucleus and the calculation of the average is complicated in the general case . however ,",
    "if the velocity @xmath80 of the impinging particle is large in comparison with the velocity @xmath91 of the target nucleus , the problem is simplified .",
    "the target wave function does not have time for significant evolution during the collision and it can be taken as that of the initial ( unperturbed ) state .",
    "this is the main content of the sudden approximation : the velocity distribution of the target nuclei @xmath92 can be taken as the initial one @xmath93 and one has to compute : @xmath94 by using eq.([sigmadivrel ] ) , one has thus to compute : @xmath95",
