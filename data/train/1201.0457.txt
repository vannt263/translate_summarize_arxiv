    "[ figure_5gon ]      the key idea of how to find the morse index of a critical point is to deform the linkage in such a way that the morse index does not change .",

    "prove it for @xmath123 .",

    "there are just two polygons that are irreducible in this sense : the two stars with @xmath124 .",
    "since the morse index of the positively oriented star is bigger than the morse index of the negatively oriented star , the morse indices are determined uniquely .",
    "the statements ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) directly follow from ( 2 ) .",
