    "it has been fourteen years since warm inflation was introduced and with it the first and still only alternative dynamical realisation of inflation to the standard scenario .",
    "the standard picture of inflation introduced in 1981 relied on a scalar field , called the inflaton , which during inflation was assumed to have no interaction with any other fields . during inflation , this field rolls down its potential and due to it being coupled to the background metric , a damping - like term is present which slows down its motion . as this inflaton field",
    "was assumed to not interact with other fields , there was no possibility for radiation to be produced during inflation , thus leading to a thermodynamically supercooled phase of the universe during inflation .",
    "getting out of this inflation phase and putting the universe into a radiation dominated phase was a key issue , termed the ",
    "graceful exit \" problem @xcite . the first successful solution of the graceful exit problem and so",
    "the first successful cold inflation model , was new inflation @xcite .",
    "the solution was to picture particle production as a distinct separate stage after inflationary expansion in a period called reheating . in this phase ,",
    "couplings to other fields were assumed to be present and the inflaton would find itself in a very steep potential well in which it would oscillate .",
    "these oscillations would lead to a radiative production of particles .",
    "there have been many variants of the original cold inflation picture , first introduced in the context of the new inflation model and shortly afterwards in the chaotic inflation model  @xcite , with many other models that followed .",
    "the warm inflation picture differs from the cold inflation picture in that there is no separate reheating phase in the former , and rather radiation production occurs concurrently with inflationary expansion .",
    "the constraints by general relativity for realising an inflationary phase simply require that the vacuum energy density dominates and so this does not rule out the possibility that there is still a substantial radiation energy density present during inflation .",
    "thus on basic principles , the most general picture of inflation accommodates a radiation energy density component .",
    "the presence of radiation during inflation implies the inflationary phase could smoothly end into a radiation dominated phase without a distinctively separate reheating phase , by the simple process of the vacuum energy falling faster than the radiation energy , so that at some point a smooth crossover occurs .",
    "this is the warm inflation solution to the graceful exit problem .",
    "dynamically warm inflation is realised if the inflaton were interacting with other fields during the inflation phase .",
    "in fact in any realistic model of inflation , the inflaton must be coupled to other fields , since eventually the inflaton must release its vacuum energy to other fields thereby creating particles which form the subsequent radiation dominated era in the universe .",
    "thus the idea that these couplings to other fields somehow are inactive during inflation , as pictured in the cold inflation picture , is something that does require verifying by detailed calculation .",
    "when such calculations are done , the result is that there are regimes in which particle production during inflation occurs .",
    "this review will present the calculations which demonstrate particle production during inflation , thereby leading to a warm inflationary expansion .",
    "the idea of particle production concurrent with inflationary expansion was first suggested in the pre - inflation inflation paper by l.z .",
    "fang in 1980 @xcite .",
    "his paper proposed using a scalar field with the origin of inflationary expansion due to a claimed anomalous dissipation term that would be generated based on landau theory if the field was undergoing a second order phase transition .",
    "this was dynamically very different from the scalar field inflation that eventually became successful , and the source of dissipation was also different from that in warm inflation .",
    "however this model captured the basic idea of concurrent particle production and inflation .",
    "then in the mid-80s two papers proposed adding a local @xmath0 type dissipation term into the evolution equation of the inflaton field , moss @xcite and then yokoyama and maeda  @xcite . in both cases",
    "the dissipative term generated a source of radiation production during inflation .",
    "the idea of a dissipative term was re - discovered independently by berera and fang  @xcite almost a decade later .",
    "they went further by proposing that the consistent dynamics of the inflaton field was a langevin equation , in which a fluctuation - dissipation theorem would uniquely specify the fluctuations of the inflaton field . that paper by berera and fang provided the foundations for the theory of fluctuations in warm inflation and the langevin equation has since been the fundamental equation governing inflaton dynamics . following that work , in  @xcite berera proposed that a separate reheating phase , as standard in all inflation models up to then , could be eliminated altogether .",
    "this paper proposed a new picture of inflation , which it termed warm inflation , in which the process of inflationary expansion with concurrent radiation production could terminate simply by the radiation energy over - taking the vacuum energy , thus going from an inflationary to a radiation dominated era .",
    "this work presented an alternative solution to the graceful exit problem to the one given by the standard inflation scenario .",
    "this warm inflation picture was verified explicitly in @xcite , where the friedmann equations for a universe consisting of vacuum and radiation energy were studied and gave many exact warm inflation solutions to the graceful exit problem .",
    "finally in  @xcite the calculation of fluctuations were done by berera for the inflaton evolving by a langevin equation in a thermal inflationary universe .    alongside the development of the basic scenario ,",
    "the first principles quantum field theory dynamics of warm inflation was developed .",
    "this started in @xcite with a quantum mechanical model which demonstrated the origin of the fluctuation - dissipation relation in warm inflation .",
    "the key step in deriving warm inflation from quantum field theory is in realising an overdamped regime for the evolution of the background inflaton field .",
    "the initial attempt at this was done by berera , gleiser and ramos in  @xcite . in this work",
    ", it was proposed that the overdamped evolution should occur under adiabatic conditions in which the microscopic dynamical processes operated much faster than all macroscopic evolution , in particular the scalar field motion and hubble expansion . based on this criteria , a set of consistency conditions were formulated in @xcite , which would be required for a self - consistent solution .",
    "however in  @xcite no explicit warm inflation solutions were found .",
    "this point was further highlighted by yokoyama and linde in  @xcite , in which several models were studied from which the conclusions of  @xcite were verified .",
    "the problem in these early works was that dissipation effects were being looked at in a high temperature regime and it proved too difficult to keep finite temperature effective potential corrections small , so that the inflaton potential remained relatively flat , and at the same time obtain a large dissipative coefficient .",
    "one type of model was shown that could realise such requirements  @xcite and this was the first quantum field theory model of warm inflation , although it was not a very compelling model .",
    "subsequently berera and ramos in @xcite suggested a solution for getting around the mutual constraints of obtaining a large dissipative coefficient and yet small effective potential corrections .",
    "the main observation was that supersymmetry can cancel local quantum corrections , such as zero temperature corrections to the effective potential , whereas temporally non - local quantum effects , such as those that underly the dissipative effects , will not be cancelled .",
    "this led to @xcite proposing a two - stage interaction configuration , in which the inflaton was coupled to heavy `` catalyst '' fields with masses larger than the temperature of the universe and these fields in turn were coupled to light fields .",
    "the evolution of the inflaton would induce light particle production via the heavy catalyst fields .",
    "since these heavy catalyst fields were basically in their ground state , the quantum corrections associated with them could be cancelled in supersymmetric models .",
    "the calculation of the low temperature dissipative coefficients for this two - stage mechanism were first done by moss and xiong @xcite .",
    "there is an earlier review which covered the basics of the warm inflation scenario @xcite . in this review full details",
    "will be developed of the quantum field theory dynamics of warm inflation .",
    "this will first start in sec .",

    "the foundation of cosmology is the cosmological principle which states no observer occupies a preferred position in the universe .",
    "this principle implies the universe must be homogeneous ( looks the same from every point ) and isotropic ( looks the same in all directions ) . to quantify the cosmological principle , in regards the geometry , the metric of a space - time which is spatially homogeneous and isotropic is given by the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric ,    @xmath3 , \\label{frw}\\ ] ]    where @xmath4 are spherical - polar coordinates parameterizing the spatial dimensions",
    ", @xmath5 is cosmic time , and @xmath6 describe spaces of constant positive , negative and zero spatial curvature .",
    "the most important quantity here is @xmath7 which is the cosmic scale factor and describes the expansion of the universe .",
    "the hubble parameter , defined by    @xmath8    quantifies how fast the universe expands .",
    "the evolution of the scale factor is related to the pressure @xmath9 and density @xmath10 by the scale factor acceleration equation ,    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is newton s gravitational constant .",
    "energy conservation is expressed by @xmath13    inflation by definition is a phase when the scale factor is growing at an accelerated rate , @xmath14 , which based on eq .",
    "( [ scalee ] ) requires @xmath15 , thus for a substance with negative pressure .",
    "the spatial part of the metric evolves rapidly towards the flat metric @xmath16 , and    @xmath17    the most common example of inflationary expansion occurs when the dominant form of matter has equation of state @xmath18 , which is called vacuum energy .",
    "such an equation of state plugged into eq ( [ fried ] ) leads to an exponential scale factor behavior @xmath19 , with @xmath20 constant .",
    "= 8.50 cm    the key problem of inflationary cosmology has been trying to realise inflation from a realistic particle physics motivated model . the general observation which has driven",
    "this idea is that a scalar field has the necessary equation of state needed for inflation .",
    "in particular the energy and pressure density of a scalar field are , respectively , given by    @xmath21    with the key point being that the potential energy of this field has precisely the equation of state conducive to inflation .",
    "thus , the basic idea has always been to somehow get the potential energy of a scalar field to dominate the energy density in the universe , and thereby drive inflation .",
    "and then , once enough inflation has occurred , to convert the potential energy into radiation and enter into a radiation dominated expansion phase .",
    "there are two underlying dynamical realisations of inflation , into which all models fall , cold and warm inflation . both dynamical pictures are summarized in fig .",
    "[ ciwi ] and this subsection will review both pictures .      this is the standard picture of inflationary dynamics . in the cold inflationary picture ,",
    "one or more scalar inflaton fields are assumed to decouple from everything apart from gravity .",
    "the energy density is dominated by the scalar field potential .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ figqdp ] it is shown a @xmath22 potential , in which when the inflaton amplitude is displaced to some @xmath23 , inflation can occur .",
    "the evolution of the scalar field in the frw universe is described by the general relativistic version of the klein - gordon equation ,    @xmath24    in this equation the hubble damping term , @xmath25 , formally acts like a friction term that damps the inflaton evolution .",
    "however this @xmath26 term does not lead to dissipative energy production , since its origin is from the coupling of the scalar field with the background frw metric .",
    "the inflaton plays the role of driving inflation as well as providing the seeds for density fluctuations .",
    "this subsection only focuses on the first of these requirements .    in order for inflation to occur ,",
    "the inflaton must be potential energy dominated , which means the potential energy @xmath27 must be larger than the gradient energy @xmath28 and the kinetic energy @xmath29 ,    @xmath30    moreover , in order to obtain enough inflation , these conditions must persist for some span of time .",
    "the usual way to achieve this is for the inflaton to start out almost homogeneous and at rest in some small patch of space and then to have the inflaton evolution equation overdamped , with approximate form    @xmath31    the consistency of this approximation is governed by conditions on a set of two slow - roll parameters ,    @xmath32    where @xmath33 , so @xmath34 gev . if these conditions hold in a region of space , then inflation can happen .    for the inflaton dynamics described by eq .",
    "( [ cieom ] ) , it is instructive to see how an inflationary scale factor growth occurs .",
    "it follows from the approximate eqs .",
    "( [ slowre1 ] ) and ( [ slowre2 ] ) that @xmath35 and therefore , for @xmath36 the expansion is roughly constant . from eq .",
    "( [ slowre2 ] ) we see that @xmath37 , where @xmath38 , as we stated earlier .",
    "the evolution of any radiation contribution to the energy density in the universe also can be easily studied in this example .",
    "the energy conservation equation becomes @xmath39 , which has the exponentially decaying solution @xmath40 .",
    "in other words , whatever the initial radiation energy density in the universe at the onset of cold inflation , this rapidly decays away , thus supercooling the universe . as shown in fig .",
    "[ ciwi ] , during cold inflation , the vacuum energy density is large and almost constant , whereas the radiation energy density is negligible , hence the name cold inflation .",
    "once a region of adequately large potential energy materializes , the physics of the subsequent evolution is quite straightforward .",
    "the gravitational repulsion caused by the negative pressure drives that region into a period of accelerated expansion .",
    "one expresses the amount of inflation as the ratio of the scale factor at the end of inflation @xmath41 to that at the beginning @xmath42 , and it is usually stated in terms of the number of e - folds @xmath43 ,    @xmath44    in order to inflate the horizon size to a scale covering the observable universe , it is necessary to have around 60 e - folds of inflation .    eventually , inflation must end and radiation must be introduced into a very cold universe so as to put it back into a radiation dominated hot big bang regime , which is the so called graceful exit problem @xcite . in the cold inflation picture , the process that performs this task is called reheating @xcite .",
    "this is usually envisioned as occurring shortly after the slow - roll approximation has broken down , and is often associated with oscillations of the inflaton field about the minimum of its potential .",
    "an example of this type of potential will be studied in more detail in subsec .",
    "[ workexp ] .",
    "if the inflaton is interacting with other matter fields , the oscillations of the inflaton will lead to particle production so that , as shown in fig .",
    "[ ciwi ] , the radiation energy density begins to increase .",
    "the other dynamical realisation of inflation is warm inflation .",
    "this picture is similar to cold inflation to the extent that the scalar inflaton field must be potential energy dominated to realise inflation .",
    "the difference is , in this picture the inflaton is not assumed to be an isolated , non - interacting field during the inflation period .",
    "so , rather than the universe supercooling during inflation , instead the universe maintains a small amount of radiation during inflation , enough to noticeably alter inflaton dynamics .",
    "in particular , the dividing point between warm and cold inflation is roughly at @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the radiation energy density present during inflation and @xmath20 is the hubble parameter .",
    "thus @xmath47 is the warm inflation regime and @xmath48 is the cold inflation regime .",
    "this criterion is independent of thermalisation , but if such were to occur , one sees this criteria basically amounts to the warm inflation regime corresponding to when @xmath49 .",
    "this condition is easy to understand since the typical inflaton mass during inflation is @xmath50 and so when @xmath51 , thermal fluctuations of the inflaton field will become important .",
    "subsequent to the introduction of warm inflation , other scenarios have been suggested which utilize some of its concepts such as thermal fluctuations during inflation @xcite and graceful exit via radiation energy density that smoothly becomes dominant @xcite ; however the dynamics in these scenarios differs from that of scalar field stochastic evolution .",
    "the interaction of the inflaton with other fields implies its effective evolution equation in general will have terms representing dissipation of energy out of the inflaton system and into other particles .",
    "berera and fang @xcite initially suggested that for a consistent description of an inflaton field that dissipates energy , the inflaton evolution equation should be of the langevin form , in which there is a fluctuation - dissipation relation which uniquely relates the field fluctuations and energy dissipation .",
    "this has formed the basis of all fluctuation calculations in warm inflation .",
    "the simplest such equation would be one in which the dissipation is temporally local ,    @xmath52 { \\dot \\phi } % + \\xi r \\phi   - \\frac{1}{a^2(t ) } \\nabla^2 \\phi + v'(\\phi)= \\xi . \\label{wieom}\\ ] ]    in this equation , @xmath0 is a dissipative term and @xmath53 is a fluctuating force .",
    "both are effective terms arising due to the interaction of the inflaton with other fields . in general these two terms",
    "will be related through a fluctuation - dissipation theorem , which would depend on the statistical state of the system and the microscopic dynamics .",
    "equations like ( [ wieom ] ) are the main subject of this review , and will be further described in the next subsection and in secs .",
    "[ sec tft]-[fd ] .    in order for warm inflation to occur",
    "the potential energy @xmath54 must be larger than both the radiation energy density @xmath46 and the inflaton s kinetic energy .",
    "a major difference from cold inflation is in the evolution of the energy densities , as can be compared in fig .",
    "[ ciwi ] . in warm inflation",
    "the radiation energy does not vanish because vacuum energy is continuously being dissipated at the rate @xmath55 .",
    "the energy conservation equation ( [ econs ] ) for this system of vacuum and radiation becomes    @xmath56    in this equation the second term on the right - hand - side acts like a source term which is feeding in radiation energy , whereas the first term is a sink term that is depleting it away .",
    "when @xmath20 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are slowly varying , which is a good approximation during inflation , there will be some nonzero steady state point for @xmath46 .",
    "thus at large times , compared to the local hubble time , the radiation in the universe becomes independent of initial conditions and depends only on the rate at which the source is producing radiation .",
    "a series of slow - roll conditions must be satisfied for a prolonged period of inflation to take place .",
    "the slow - roll parameters for warm inflation are    @xmath59    the slow - roll conditions for warm inflation can be expressed as    @xmath60    where the parameter @xmath61 is defined by    @xmath62    the inflationary solution to the system of equations can be shown to be an attractor when the slow - roll conditions are satisfied @xcite .",
    "these conditions can be weaker than the corresponding slow - roll conditions for cold inflation if @xmath61 is large .",
    "inflation ends when the vacuum energy ceases to dominate , which is typically when @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "exact solutions for background warm inflationary cosmologies of radiation and vacuum energy densities were computed in @xcite .",
    "additional slow - roll conditions must be imposed if the dissipation coefficient or the potential depend on the radiation density .",
    "for example , in the case of thermal radiation there are quantum thermal corrections to the inflaton potential .",
    "an additional slow - roll parameter describes this effect ,    @xmath65    the slow - roll condition for @xmath66 is stronger than the slow - roll conditions on the other parameters @xcite , @xmath67 this condition is crucial to the realisation of warm inflationary models .",
    "basically , this condition states that viable warm inflationary models use some mechanism for suppressing thermal corrections to the inflaton potential .",
    "it is worth stressing the fact that the presence of radiation during the inflationary epoch is perfectly consistent with the equations of motion .",
    "all that is required is that the vacuum energy density @xmath54 be larger than the radiation energy density @xmath46 . in cold inflation , both the radiation energy density and the friction term are negligible , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath68 and @xmath69",
    ". the main difference between warm inflation and cold inflation is the reversal of this first condition , i.e. @xmath70 . there are two regimes that can then be identified , strong and weak dissipative warm inflation .",
    "strong dissipative warm inflation is the case @xmath71 , and weak dissipative warm inflation is @xmath72 .",
    "the terminology here is almost self - explanatory , in the strong dissipative regime , the dissipative coefficient @xmath57 controls the damped evolution of the inflaton field and in the weak dissipative regime , the hubble damping is still the dominant term .",
    "even though the presence of radiation need not hinder inflationary growth , it can still influence inflaton dynamics .",
    "consider , for example , inflation occurring at the grand unified theory scale , which means @xmath73 gev .",
    "in this case the hubble parameter turns out to be @xmath74 gev . for cold inflation and weak dissipative warm inflation , with just the hubble damping term",
    ", the effective inflaton mass @xmath75 could be at most @xmath76 . the key point to appreciate here",
    "is that there are five orders of magnitude difference here between the vacuum energy scale and the scale of the inflaton mass .",
    "thus there is a huge difference in scales between the energy scale @xmath77 driving inflation and the energy scale @xmath78 governing inflaton dynamics .",
    "this means , for example , in order to excite the inflaton fluctuations above their ground state only requires a minuscule fraction of the vacuum energy to be dissipated as radiation , something at a level as low as @xmath79 .",
    "this gives an indication that dissipative effects during inflation have the possibility to play a noticeable role ( several models of warm inflation models exploiting these properties exist @xcite ) .",
    "of course , this energy scale assessment is only suggestive .",
    "this remains a question that only a proper dynamical calculation can answer .",
    "in particular , the universe is expanding rapidly during inflation , at a rate characterised by the hubble parameter @xmath20 , and one must determine whether the fundamental dynamics responsible for dissipation can occur at a rate faster than the hubble expansion .    another difference between warm inflation and cold inflation is how the slow - roll conditions feed back into conditions on the parameters of the underlying particle model .",
    "this in particular becomes evident in the strong dissipative regime when @xmath80 . to appreciate this point , note that in cold inflation the slow - roll conditions require inflaton mass to satisfy @xmath81 , and this can be a problem in realistic quantum field theory models of inflation .",
    "the reason most realistic models of inflation rely on supersymmetry is to help cancel quantum corrections and thus maintain the desired flatness of the inflaton potential .",
    "however , supersymmetry can be local as well as global .",
    "any local , or supergravity theory has associated with it a k \" ahler potential which alters the scalar field potential @xcite .",
    "generic k \" ahler potentials lead to inflaton masses bigger than @xmath20 , thus contradicting the slow roll conditions .",
    "one must then consider only very special k \" ahler potentials that can be consistent with inflation .",
    "this restricts model building prospects , but even more seriously , it is very likely that these very special forms may not be produced when the k \" ahler potential is derived , as opposed to put in by hand .",
    "this is often called the `` @xmath82-problem '' @xcite",
    ". there are solutions that attempt to stablize the flat directions @xcite thus allow cold inflation .",
    "moreover a very different proposal that can overcome the `` @xmath82-problem '' in cold inflation is d - term inflation @xcite .",
    "however all these solutions require greater model building details .",
    "in contrast , in warm inflation slow - roll motion only requires from eq .",
    "( [ slowwi ] ) @xmath83 , which means that when @xmath71 the inflaton mass @xmath84 , which can be much bigger than in the cold inflation case .",
    "this relaxation on the constraint in the inflaton mass permits much greater freedom in building realistic inflaton models , since the `` @xmath82-problem '' is eliminated .",
    "another model building consequence differing warm inflation to cold inflation relates to the range of the scalar field @xmath58 in which the inflation occurs . for cold inflation , for the simplest kinds of potentials , which also are the most commonly used , such as @xmath85 and @xmath86 , calculations show that the inflaton range has to be above the planck scale @xmath87",
    "this arises because inflation ends when @xmath88 , and in order to have the desired 60 or so e - folds of inflation , the inflaton has to start with a value larger than @xmath89 .",
    "although the potential can still be below the planck energy density , there are likely to be difficulties from quantum gravity or supergravity effects , which are discussed in further detail in sec .",
    "[ particlemod ] .",
    "the upshot is that restrictions have to be placed on model building simply to avoid this problem . on the other hand in warm inflation , when @xmath71 , the added dissipation means the period of slow roll necessary to obtain the desired 60 or so e - folds can be achieved with the inflaton traversing over a much smaller range .",
    "for example , with monomial potentials , the inflaton amplitude is below the planck scale @xmath90 in warm inflation .",
    "potentials which do not allow cold inflation can sometimes be used for warm inflationary model building , as will be further discussed in sec .",
    "[ particlemod ] .",
    "the sources of density fluctuations in warm inflationary models are the thermal fluctuations in the radiation fields .",
    "this is a substantial departure from cold inflation , where the density fluctuations arise from quantum vacuum fluctuations . in this subsection",
    "the inflaton fluctuations during warm inflation are related to a langevin equation for the inflaton field .",

    "note that the maximum time rule quoted above only applies when @xmath206 .",
    "an important case of the background field approach is when the system is close to thermal equilibrium and the background fields vary slowly compared to the relaxation time of the system . in this case , it can be appropriate to take the propagator of the background field expansion to be in thermal equilibrium , and relate all of the non - equilibrium effects to the background field dependent interaction terms .",
    "now we introduce effective equations of motion , where there is a background field , which makes the role of a system , and quantum fields , considered as the environment to which the system is coupled to . by integrating out the quantum fields it is possible to arrive at a background field equation , which is of a langevin - like type typical of a system in interaction with an environment .",
    "we will keep our formalism as simple and general as possible , allowing then to extend it to specific model examples later on .      the basic motivation for the study of the nonequilibrium dynamics of a background field in the context of a separation between a system and an environment to which it is coupled to comes from many different physical systems of interest . in the case of inflation",
    ", it is the inflaton field whose slow - roll dynamics generates the necessary conditions for a successful inflationary scenario .",
    "almost all models of inflation involve evolution with loss of energy of the inflaton field to other fields ( or degrees of freedom ) to which it is coupled to .",
    "this process of energy transfer from the inflaton ( regarded as the system ) to the other fields is a fundamental requirement of equipartition , where some portion of the system s energy has to flow irreversibly to the environment .",
    "this process is not exclusive to inflation , and occurs in any phase transition where some order parameter characterising the global thermodynamic properties of the system relaxes to an equilibrium point .",
    "the study of the nonequilibrium dynamics of fields have been approached using different techniques of quantum field theory and quantum statistical mechanics , including variational techniques @xcite , the use of resummation techniques , for example using the two - particle irreducible ( 2pi ) procedure @xcite , and the use of kinetic equation methods @xcite .",
    "these different approaches have in common the possibility of keeping all the dynamics unitary , but at the expense of keeping track of every field , and not just the one whose dynamics we are most interested in .",
    "even though this study might be done in a relatively complete fashion for some simple models , it gets quickly cumbersome as the number of fields ( and field modes ) increases .    in the langevin - like approach we focus on the dynamics of the relevant field describing the system and not on the the remaining field modes . these instead act on the system through dissipative and stochastic noise terms , whose effects then become manifest .",
    "this is a much more economical way of studying the nonequilibrium dynamics , since we concentrate only on a given ( more relevant ) field mode .",
    "this approach has a long history which can be traced back to einstein s famous explanation of brownian motion @xcite , and includes classics such as the work of caldeira and leggett @xcite . in their work an harmonic oscillator , regarded as the system ,",
    "is coupled linearly to a set of other oscillators , regarded as the thermal bath or environment . by integrating out the thermal bath ,",
    "the resulting dynamics of the system becomes explicitly of langevin form , where dissipation and stochastic noise emerges .",
    "extension of these studies to the context of nonlinear couplings between system and thermal bath have been implemented by hu , paz and zhang @xcite .",
    "though in quantum mechanics the system , which is out of equilibrium , and the thermal bath , which drives the system towards equilibrium , may be well separated , in the context of nonlinear field theories this distinction may be considered somewhat blurred .",
    "even so , for self - interacting field theories , there are situations where short wavelength modes can serve as the thermal bath driving the longer wavelength modes , which have slower dynamics , into equilibrium . in this sense",
    ", the field can be its own thermal bath .",
    "of course , other fields coupled to a background scalar field ( the system ) may also serve as the thermal bath .",
    "one of the first implementations of this interpretation in the context of quantum field theory , and motivated by the reheating problem in inflation , was the work by hosoya and sakagami @xcite , who obtained an approximate dissipation term in the equation of motion for a scalar field .",
    "they did this by examining small deviations from equilibrium in the boltzmann equation for the number density operator and then supplemented this by a computation of transport coefficients using zubarev s method for nonequilibrium statistical operators @xcite .",
    "the derivation of dissipation terms in the context of the @xmath209 model was also performed using operator methods by morikawa and sasaki in @xcite .",
    "later , in the context of the ctp formalism , morikawa @xcite obtained an effective langevin - like equation for a scalar field interacting with a fermionic bath , including explicit fluctuation and dissipation terms .    other work that analysed the emergence of dissipation and fluctuation in the effective field dynamics was the work done by hu and collaborators @xcite , who analysed a scalar field quantum bath quadratically coupled to a background scalar field system , while lee and boyanovsky considered the case of a scalar field thermal bath linearly coupled to a background scalar field system @xcite , with more realistic couplings considered later on @xcite .",
    "in the work of gleiser and ramos @xcite , a systematic study in the context of the loop expansion at high temperature was performed for both the @xmath210 model and also for quadratic coupling to another scalar field .",
    "one important aspect of the dynamics that was demonstrated by these first references was that the noise terms emerging in the effective dynamics was in general colored , _",
    "i.e. _ non markovian , and multiplicative , _",
    "i.e. _ field dependent ( unless the coupling between system and bath was linear ) .",
    "thus , these studies have shown that the effective equation that describes the approach to equilibrium of the slower moving modes can be quite different from the typical phenomenological langevin equation with its white and additive noise terms .",
    "all these early studies were performed in the context of minkowski spacetime .",
    "one of the first to consider dissipative dynamics in the context of a curved spacetime was ringwald @xcite .",

    "first , in the strong dissipative regime they have no  @xmath82\"-problem .",
    "@xmath82\"-problem typically emerges since supergravity ( sugra ) corrections to the inflaton mass are of order the hubble scale , yet in cold inflation the inflaton needs a mass less than the hubble scale to realise slow - roll inflation @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in strong dissipative warm inflation , the inflaton mass is much bigger than the hubble scale , so such models are fairly insensitive to sugra corrections .",
    "the second attractive feature of warm inflation models is for monomial potentials the amplitude @xmath58 of the inflaton field is always below the planck scale . in cold inflation , for monomial potentials @xcite , the inflaton amplitude during inflation is larger than the planck scale .",
    "this is a problem for model building .",
    "quantum field theory models are generally regarded as low energy effective theories of some higher more fundamental theory , such as possibly strings , and there is some upper energy scale to which this low energy approximation is valid . above this scale ,",
    "the theory would be modified by additional , usually an infinite number of , operator corrections .",
    "the highest scale can be the planck scale , and so for any quantum theory above this scale one expects an infinite number of nonrenormalisable operator corrections , @xmath344 , which have to be retained @xcite .",
    "in such a regime the low energy approximation to the theory is essentially not useful .",
    "thus from a model building perspective cold monomial inflation models are difficult to implement , whereas warm inflation models discussed in this section do not suffer this complication .",
    "hilltop inflation models @xcite are one type of single field cold inflation model where the inflaton amplitude remains below the planck scale initially during inflation , thus when the large scale features are determined .",
    "however even in these models typically the inflaton amplitude goes above the planck scale by the end of inflation . beyond these models , maintaining the inflaton amplitude below the planck scale in cold inflation models requires more elaborate constructions , with a few examples such as @xcite .",
    "however for warm inflation , as will be seen in this section the simplest monomial models are consistent both from the cosmological and particle physics perspective .",
    "one generic feature of warm inflation models is that they require a large number of fields , usually in the hundreds or more . from the perspective of the simple single or few field inflation models typically seen in cold inflation",
    ", this feature of warm inflation models may appear undesirable .",
    "however in most high energy particle physics models , there are typically many fields present .",
    "in fact , from the perspective of string theory , where there are a huge number of fields , warm inflation models can look very compelling .",
    "thus , in its own right , the requirement of a large number of fields distinguishes warm inflation models from their cold counterparts , but one can not say that they are necessarily more peculiar .",
    "to calculate a warm inflation model it requires solving the evolution equation ( [ wieom ] ) and constraining the result with the density fluctuation amplitude and spectral index .",
    "in addition , for a first principles model , the dissipative coefficient @xmath57 has been computed from an underlying quantum field theory model .",
    "one assumption in such calculations is that the microphysical dynamics determining @xmath57 is operating at time scales much faster than that of the macroscopic motion of the inflaton background field and the expansion scale of the universe . to realise",
    "such an adiabatic regime leads to a set of consistency conditions @xcite ,    @xmath345    where @xmath346 here represents all relevant decay widths of the fields responsible for dissipation .",
    "another challenge in realising warm inflation models from first principles is the effect of radiative and thermal corrections to the effective potential , which if too large would ruin the necessary flatness of the inflaton potential .",
    "there are competing requirements in that large dissipation prefers large couplings whereas controlling radiative and thermal corrections requires small couplings .",
    "supersymmetry provides a means to achieve both these requirements .",
    "the observation is that susy will cancel local radiative corrections such as the loop corrections to the effective potential .",
    "thus the use of susy models with interactions like the ones shown in sec .",
    "however susy is ineffective in cancelling time nonlocal loop effects from which dissipation emerges .",
    "of course there are still limitations .",
    "for one thing , since inflation requires a nonzero vacuum energy , susy must be broken , thus cancellations of radiative corrections are never perfect .",
    "moreover , susy is also broken at finite temperature and so thermal loop corrections do not cancel exactly , although a significant amount of cancellation does occur @xcite .    with these considerations in mind , several warm inflation models",
    "have by now been constructed .",
    "the first of these were the distributed mass ( dm ) models @xcite .",

    "moreover , warm inflation occurs when @xmath150 is at or above the fine structure splitting scale but much below the scale of the string mass level .",
