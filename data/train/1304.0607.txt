    "the desire of building a quantum computer to solve quantum problems efficiently has lead to an immense recent development in the studies of quantum information theory in many body systems and its connection to quantum phase transitions .",
    "many important quantum information theoretic measures exhibit interesting scaling behavior close to a quantum critical point ( qcp ) of a quantum many body system .",
    "one such measure is the ground state quantum fidelity , which is an overlap of the ground state wave function at two different values of the parameters of the quantum hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the fidelity has attracted the attention of the condensed matter physicists in recent years because of its ability to detect a quantum critical point without an a priori knowledge of the order parameter of the system , which otherwise is the conventional way of probing a quantum phase transition ( qpt)@xcite . the quantum fidelity shows a dip at a qcp while the fidelity susceptibility ( which defines the rate at which the fidelity changes for a finite system in the limit when the two parameters under consideration are infinitesimally close in the parameter space ) shows a peak right there and has a scaling form given in terms of some of the exponents associated with the corresponding qpt @xcite .",
    "similarly , the fidelity has been conjectured to exhibit an interesting scaling relation involving the quantum critical exponents also in the thermodynamically large system for a finite separation between the parameters @xcite .",
    "although approaches based on the fidelity and the fidelity susceptibility have been successful in detecting various types of quantum phase transition points , for example , ordinary critical points separating two gapped phases through a gapless point@xcite or topological qpts@xcite or qpt in bose hubbard model @xcite , but its usefulness in a general scenario is not yet fully settled .",
    "the absence of a peak in the fidelity susceptibility when @xmath0 ( where @xmath1 is the correlation length exponent associated with the qcp of @xmath2-dimensional system ) has been argued in refs . .",
    "it has also been shown that in the marginal case ( @xmath3 ) , a sharp dip in the fidelity is absent at the qcp using the example of dirac points in two dimensions@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the presence of a quasi - periodic lattice introduces extra peaks in fidelity susceptibility which can not be detected by studying the energy spectrum @xcite . to show one more contradiction , we present a model where the fidelity detects the onset of a gapless quantum critical region but not the transition between two different phases within this gapless quantum critical region .",
    "one of the other important quantities which bridges a connection between the quantum information theory and qpt is the ground state loschmidt echo ( @xmath4 ) @xcite .",
    "the loschmidt echo is the measure of the overlap ( at an instant @xmath5 ) of the same initial state , the ground state of the initial hamiltonian of a many body system @xmath6 , but evolving under the influence of the two hamiltonians , @xmath6 and @xmath7 ; in this sense , it is the dynamical counterpart of the static fidelity zanardi06 .",
    "this @xmath4 also shows a dip at the qcp , thus enabling us to detect it . from the viewpoint of quantum information theory ,",
    "loschmidt echo can be used to measure the quantum to classical transition ( or the transition from a pure to the mixed state ) of a qubit coupled to an environment consisting of the many - body system . in this case",
    ", it is the interaction between the qubit and the many body system that changes the parameter @xmath8 of the hamiltonian to @xmath9 quan06 .",
    "the notion of the @xmath4 was actually introduced in connection to the quantum to classical transition in quantum chaos @xcite and now extended to various other systems undergoing a qpt like ising model @xcite , bose - einstein condensate model @xcite and dicke model@xcite .",
    "it has also been studied experimentally using nmr experiments @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we point out the inability of the fidelity or the @xmath4 to detect certain special class of qcps by taking the example of staggered transverse field in a three spin interacting spin-1/2 xx chain @xcite .",
    "there are several studies which explore the phase transition in similar or slightly different three site interacting hamiltonians using tools like zero and finite temperature magnetization and magnetization susceptibility @xcite and transport properties like spin drude weight and thermal drude weight @xcite .",
    "the effect of three site interaction has also been studied using magnetocaloric effect @xcite or by using dynamic structure factors of the ground state @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the effect of three site interacting hamiltonian is relatively less explored using quantum information theoretic measures which is the focus of the present paper .",
    "there have been studies using renyi entropy @xcite , concurrence , geometric discord and quantum discord @xcite , average fidelity of state transfer @xcite , geometric phase @xcite , @xmath4 @xcite and fidelity @xcite of different versions of three site interacting hamiltonian .",
    "this study is an important addition to the literature as to the best of our knowledge , the fidelity and the @xmath4 of a hamiltonian which also undergoes a very unique type of quantum phase transition , namely , from two fermi points to four fermi points , has not been investigated before.we find surprising results due to the combined effect of staggered field and three site interacting term in the calculations of fidelity and @xmath4 which are not a priori obvious .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that many interesting experimental observations , like magnetic properties of solid @xmath10 , have been interpreted as a consequence of the presence of multispin interactions @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : the model and its zero temperature phase diagram along with a brief description on the nature of the associated quantum phase transitions are presented in section ii . with an aim to study different qpts occurring in this model , we discuss the static probe , i.e. , the ground state fidelity and fidelity susceptibility in section iii , and the dynamic probe given by the ground state loschmidt echo in section iv .",
    "we summarize our results in the concluding section v.",
    "in this section , we briefly discuss the ground state phase diagram of the one - dimensional three spin interaction hamiltonian in presence of a staggered field @xmath11 given by the hamiltonian @xcite    @xmath12    where @xmath13 s are the usual pauli matrices satisfying the standard commutation relations and @xmath14 is the system size . performing the jordan wigner fermionization from spin-1/2 to spinless fermions @xmath15",
    "@xcite with the following definitions , @xmath16 we get @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the fermion annihilation operator at the site @xmath19 . to diagonalize the above hamiltonian",
    ", it is convenient to introduce two types of spinless fermions on the odd and even sub - lattices as shown below : @xmath20 substituting this in eq .",

    ", we introduce a set of basis vectors given by @xmath25 where the first index represents the presence or absence of the @xmath26 particle and the second index denotes those of the @xmath27particle . in these basis , the reduced hamiltonian @xmath28 is given by    @xmath29 .",
    "\\label{eq_matrix}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we note that to diagonalize the above hamiltonian , only the basis @xmath30 and @xmath31 needs to be rotated since the hamiltonian in the other two basis is already diagonal , i.e. , there is no mixing along these two directions .",
    "let us denote the two new directions for the two new quasi - particles @xmath32 and @xmath33 as @xmath34 and @xmath35 , which diagonalize the total hamiltonian giving four eigen energies @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 corresponding to the four eigenstates @xmath40 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath41 ( = @xmath42 ) , respectively . the two new eigen energies with @xmath43 set to unity are @xmath44 with the corresponding eigenvectors @xmath45 where @xmath46 hence , the hamiltonian can now be written in a diagonalized form as @xmath47 the ground state of this hamiltonian corresponds to all the modes with negative energies filled and hence depending upon the parameter values of the hamiltonian , the system has various phases .",
    "we briefly discuss these phases below :    * when @xmath48 : @xmath49 and @xmath50 for all @xmath51 , and hence the ground state for each mode is @xmath34 with total ground state energy @xmath52 this is the antiferromagnetic ( af ) phase .",
    "* when @xmath53 : some of the @xmath51 modes from the @xmath38 branch become negative whereas @xmath37 is negative for all the modes .",
    "this phase has two fermi points arising due to zeros of the @xmath38 branch . in this region ,",
    "the ground state for a given mode can be @xmath34 or @xmath41 depending upon whether @xmath38 branch is empty or filled .",
    "the total ground state energy in this phase is given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the heaviside function .",
    "we call this phase as spin liquid i ( sli ) phase . * when @xmath56 : in this limit , @xmath37 also crosses zero for some modes resulting to four fermi points , two from each branch",
    ". hence , there are three possible ground states for a given mode @xmath51 depending upon the signs of the energies @xmath57 given by @xmath34 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "once again the ground state energy is the sum over all the modes with negative energies for each branch as written above .",
    "this phase is called spin liquid ii ( slii ) phase .",
    "c +    following the above arguments , the phase diagram of the model is shown in fig . [ fig_phased ] a. to complete the discussion on the phase diagram , let us now comment upon the nature of these quantum phase transitions .",
    "we define a stiffness @xmath58 for a system of size @xmath14 as @xmath59 a diverging @xmath58 points to a second order quantum phase transition in the ground state of the system . in fig .",
    "[ fig_phased ] b , we present @xmath58 as a function of @xmath11 for two different values of @xmath60 which clearly shows that the phase transition from af to sli phase and sli to slii phase is indeed a second order quantum phase transition .",
    "the two gapless phases sli and slii are characterized by two different types of power law decays of transverse spin - spin correlation functions @xmath61 as shown in ref . .",
    "these correlation functions for @xmath62 are given by , @xmath63 and @xmath64 where all the constants ( @xmath65 ) are smooth functions of @xmath60 .",
    "we now try to capture these phase transitions using the fidelity approach , especially the phase transition from sli to slii , and later discuss them in the light of loschmidt echo .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the ground state fidelity is defined as the overlap between the two ground state wave functions at different parameter values ; for the present model the fidelity is given by @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the total ground state at @xmath68 and @xmath69 is the ground state for the @xmath70 mode .",
    "thus , while evaluating @xmath71 , one has to carefully identify the ground state for the @xmath70 mode depending upon the sign of @xmath72 .",
    "the various possibilities are :    * @xmath73 , with @xmath74 defined in eq .",
    "[ eq_theta ] * @xmath75 * @xmath76 with similar cross products also equal to zero .    here",
    ", we fix the notation of the bra / ket without any subscript to denote the field @xmath11 and with a subscript @xmath77 when the field is @xmath78 , which will be followed through out the rest of the paper .",
    "we have also used the orthogonality of the basis states in deriving the above steps .",
    "it is to be noted that within the entire gapless region including sli and slii phase , there is at least one @xmath51 mode for which @xmath79 and hence fidelity in the entire gapless region is zero . with these considerations ,",
    "we numerically evaluate the fidelity using eq .",
    "[ eq_f ] which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_fidelity ] .",
    "as discussed above , the fidelity is zero in the entire gapless region .",
    "we also briefly comment upon the behavior of the fidelity susceptibility @xmath80 which is the second order derivative of the fidelity with respect to a parameter of the hamiltonian , and in this case is given as @xmath81 as fidelity , fidelity susceptibility is also not able to capture the sli to slii phase transition and is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig_fidelity ] . to summarize",
    ", what we find is that the fidelity ( fidelity susceptibility ) shows a dip ( peak ) at the boundary separating the gapless and gapped phase whereas it fails completely to capture the phase transition occurring inside the gapless phase which could otherwise be detected by the conventional method of diverging stiffness constant .",
    "we now proceed to study the dynamic counterpart of fidelity , namely loschmidt echo in the next section .     for two different values of @xmath60 .",
    "the slii phase exists only for @xmath82 but this phase is not captured by the fidelity .",
    "fidelity only detects the gapped to gapless phase transition of the model which occurs at @xmath83 .",
    "inset shows the fidelity susceptibility for @xmath82 as a function of the staggered field for the data corresponding to the main figure with a peak at the af to sli phase transition for @xmath83 . for better clarity of the figure",
    ", we have removed the diverging value of @xmath80 at the critical point as the jump is very large . in both the figures , @xmath84 and @xmath85.,height=201 ]",
    "the ground state @xmath4 , defined as the square of the overlap of the initial wavefunction given by the ground state of the hamiltonian @xmath86 but evolving under two different parameter values of the hamiltonian @xmath11 and @xmath78 , is given as @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 , @xmath90 being the ground state of the hamiltonian @xmath86 .",
    "in the momentum representation , as in the case of fidelity , the expression for the @xmath4 gets decoupled as @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the ground state for the @xmath93th mode at @xmath68 .",
    "let us calculate @xmath94 for different possible ground states .",
    "* if @xmath95 @xmath96 since @xmath34 is the eigenstate of @xmath97 and not @xmath98 , we need to rewrite it in terms of @xmath99 , an eigenstate of @xmath100 .",
    "[ eq_rotation ] , we find that @xmath101 and @xmath74 is given by eq .",
    "[ eq_theta ] . substituting the above transformation in eq .",
    "[ eq_le2 ] , we get @xmath102 with @xmath103 .",
    "the three spin term has neither any contribution in @xmath104 nor in @xmath105 and hence does not influence the position of the dip in @xmath94 though it will affect the magnitude of the dip in @xmath4 as shown in fig .",
    "3 ; this is because the number of @xmath93 modes with @xmath34 as the ground state changes as @xmath60 is varied . *",
    "if @xmath106 or @xmath107 , then @xmath108 as these are also the eigen vectors of the hamiltonian @xmath98 .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq_lek ] ) , we find that the @xmath4 is unity deep inside the two antiferromagnetic phases where @xmath109 is infinitesimally small for all @xmath51 and small @xmath77 .",
    "the @xmath4 ( or @xmath94 ) will start deviating from unity when the term @xmath110 picks up a non - zero value .",
    "it can be easily checked that @xmath109 increases as @xmath111 approaches zero due to diverging @xmath112 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq_theta ] ) at @xmath113 , causing a dip in @xmath4 only at @xmath113 .",
    "thus , @xmath4 can neither detect af to sli phase transition discussed in section ii which is captured by the fidelity , nor it can capture sli to slii phase transition . unlike the models studied so far where the modes close to the critical mode contribute the most to the decay of the @xmath4 , we will now show that it is not so in the present model .",
    "this is because the ground state for the critical mode @xmath114 at @xmath113 is @xmath41 , for which @xmath115 is unity .",
    "for the same reasons , the modes close to this critical mode also do not contribute to the decay of @xmath4 .",
    "it is the other modes , away from the critical mode @xmath114 at @xmath113 satisfying @xmath49 and @xmath50 which actually influence the behavior of the @xmath4 .",
    "this is one of the most interesting observations of the paper .",
    "since the modes close to the critical mode are not involved in the dynamics , various power - law scalings of @xmath4 , which are observed close to the qcp of other models quan06 , are not present in this model .    to understand why @xmath4 is not able to detect the various ground state phases generated due to the presence of @xmath60 , let us revisit eq .",
    "[ eq_matrix ] . as mentioned before , @xmath40 and @xmath42",
    "do not mix and we can concentrate on @xmath30 and @xmath31 basis . in these two basis , @xmath28 can be written as @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the @xmath118 identity matrix .",
    "the non - commutativity between the terms involving @xmath119 and @xmath120 causes the time evolution of the spin chain . on the other hand , the identity term in eq .",
    "( [ eqn_lz ] ) only contributes to the phase of the evolving wave function and does not influence the @xmath4 which is a modulus - squared quantity .",
    "hence , the dynamics is dominated by the minimum energy gap of the second part @xmath121 of the hamiltonian @xcite , which occurs at @xmath113 ; consequently , the @xmath4 shows a dip right here .",
    "such an observation was also reported in the context of defect generation for a similar model where the staggered field is varied linearly as a function of time .",
    "the study finds that the scaling of the defect density is insensitive to the qpts driven by the identity operator in the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath4 usually shows a dip in the vicinity of a qcp , one refer to the staggered field @xmath122 as a dynamical critical point at which the energy gap vanishes for the dynamical critical mode @xmath123 and probe the scaling of the @xmath4 close to this dynamical critical point . we show below that the @xmath4 decays exponentially with the system size @xmath14 whereas it decays exponentially with @xmath124 for both the regions , @xmath125 and @xmath126 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_le2 ] .",
    "c +    to comprehend this behavior , let us concentrate on @xmath127ln l which using eq .",
    "( [ eq_lek ] ) can be put in the form @xmath128 where the summation is only over the relevant @xmath93modes satisfying @xmath50 and @xmath49 .",
    "since @xmath129 is the difference between two approximately equal angles in the limit @xmath130 , it is very small as the dynamical critical mode and the near by modes do not appear in the summation .",
    "we therefore get a simplified expression @xmath131 which explains the @xmath124 dependence of s or @xmath132 .",
    "it is difficult to estimate the system size dependence of the @xmath4 since the critical mode and the modes close to it do not contribute to the decay and hence no further simplifications can be done .",
    "however , one can focus on the modes closest to the dynamical critical mode @xmath123 for which @xmath50 and @xmath49 which contribute maximally to @xmath4 . in the early time limit",
    ", one gets @xmath133 which is consistent with fig .",
    "[ fig_le2 ] .",
    "our study shows that the @xmath4 is not able to detect the various phase transitions in the ground state phase diagram of the three spin interacting spin chain in presence of a staggered field .",
    "these transitions are generated due to the three spin interacting term @xmath60 which does not influence the dynamics of the hamiltonian .",
    "the @xmath4 does not sense the presence of @xmath60 and detects only the qcps corresponding to the case @xmath134 even when @xmath135 .",
    "although our study is restricted to a spin-1/2 model , the excitation spectrum as given in eq .",
    "( [ eqn_lz ] ) may exist in other models also .",
    "for example , one may consider the bose - hubbard model in the hard core limit in the presence of a period two superlattice @xcite which has a rich phase diagram containing various phases like superfluid , mott insulator , hole vacuum and particle vacuum phase .",
    "we expect similar results for the fidelity and the @xmath4 in this hard core boson model also .    at the end",
    ", we mention a couple of works which study the fidelity and @xmath4 of models containing multispin interactions in ising type hamiltonians @xcite . in ref . , the effect of some complicated three spin interaction on @xmath4 is studied and it was reported that a particular term of the hamiltonian does not effect the position of the dip of the @xmath4 and modifies only the sharpness of the decay . on the other hand ,",
    "we have studied here a completely different model with special types of qcps and presented the appropriate arguments on why the @xmath4 is not able to detect the gapped to gapless phase transition points . at the same time",
    ", the physics of our model is very different from the model studied in ref .",
    "due to the presence of staggered field which necessitates the introduction of two types of quasiparticles , thus making the problem very different from the models studied till now in the context of fidelity or loschmidt echo .",
    "the ground state fidelity , or equivalently the ground state @xmath4 shows a dip at the quantum critical point and thus can in principle be used to determine the phase diagram of any model .",
    "we show that this is not always the case taking an example of a three spin interacting spin chain in presence of a stagerred field where the conventional method of divergence of stiffness constant could detect all the critical points but the method of fidelity and @xmath4 failed . while fidelity or fidelity susceptibility can capture the boundary between the gapped to gapless phase transition and is unable to detect the two fermi points to four fermi points phase transition within the gapless region , the loschmidt echo shows a completely different picture .",
    "it is able to detect only one special point in the entire phase diagram and is not able to capture the critical points generated due to the presence of the three spin term .",
    "this is because the dynamics is entirely governed by the non - commuting terms of the reduced @xmath136 hamiltonian in @xmath93space and the identity matrix containing the three spin term only adds a phase to the wave function evolution .",
    "one of the interesting observations of this paper which has never been reported anywhere else to the best of our knowledge , is that the critical mode and its nearby modes do not contribute anything to the decay of loschmidt echo .",
    "this is in contrast to the usual scenario where the modes around the critical modes contribute maximum .",
    "we would also like to point out here that in ref .",
    ", it was shown that the fidelity susceptibility will not be able to detect any qpt if @xmath0 which is not the case here .",
