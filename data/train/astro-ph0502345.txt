    "in astrophysics ( particularly in the physics of the solar atmosphere ) , plasma `` flow '' could be assigned at least two connotations : 1 ) the flow is a primary object whose dynamics bears critically on the phenomena under investigation .",
    "the problems of the formation and the original heating of the coronal structure , the creation of channels for particle escape , for instance , fall in this category , 2 ) the flow is a secondary feature of the system , possibly created as a by  product and/or used to drive or suppress an instability . since the generation of flows which will eventually create the coronal structures @xcite is the theme of this effort , the flows here are fundamental .    by exploiting a simple two  fluid model in the solar context",
    ", several recent studies @xcite have revealed the breadth of phenomena made possible by the combined action of the flow  velocity and the magnetic fields .",
    "the flow - based approach will prove , perhaps , crucial in the study of solar corona , observationally found to be a highly dynamic arena replete with multiple  scale spatiotemporal structures ( aschwanden 2001a ) ; the approach gains immense credibility with the discovery that strong flows are found everywhere  in the subcoronal ( chromosphere ) as well as in the coronal regions ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "recent phenomenology strongly emphasizes that the solar atmosphere is an extremely inhomogeneous ( in all parameters ) area in which small and large  scale closed magnetic field structures with different temperatures co",
    " exist in nearby regions .",
    "for example , two - temperature coronal models constructed from _",
    "soho / eit _ observations indicate complicated magnetic topology and fine  scale structuring of corona ( including coronal holes ) @xcite .",
    "it is also clear that the mechanisms for energy transport and channeling of particles in solar atmosphere are deeply connected with the challenging and exciting problems of the solar coronal heating and of the origin of the solar wind ( sw ) @xcite .",
    "if flows are to play an important and essential role in determining the dynamics and structure of the solar corona , we must immediately face the problem of finding sources and mechanisms for the creation of these flows .",
    "catastrophic models of flow production in which the magnetic energy is suddenly converted into bulk kinetic energy ( and thermal energy ) are rather well  known ; various forms of magnetic reconnection ( flares , micro and nano  flares ) schemes permeate the literature ( e.g.  ( wilhelm 2001 ; christopoilou , georgakilas and koutchmy 2001 ) for chromosphere up  flow generations )",
    ". a few other mechanisms of this genre also exist : uchida ( 2001 ) proposed that the major part of the supply of energy and mass to the active regions of the corona may come from a dynamical leakage of magnetic twists produced in the sub - photospheric convection layer ; ohsaki _ et al . _",
    "( 2001 , 2002 ) have shown how a slowly evolving closed structure ( modelled as a double  beltrami two  fluid equilibrium ) may experience , under appropriate conditions , a sudden loss of equilibrium with the initial magnetic energy appearing as the mass flow energy .",
    "another mechanism , based on loop interactions and fragmentations and explaining the formation of loop threads , was given in sakai and furusawa ( 2002 ) ; the suggestion based on cascade of shock wave interactions was made in @xcite . a more quasi - static mechanism for flow generation in sub ",
    "coronal regions taking into account the density in  homogeneity of the structures was given in @xcite .",
    "before we embark on delineating the flow - generation mechanisms , we present additional evidence / speculation on their existence as well as their possible role in the processes taking place in the solar vicinity :    \\1 ) goodman ( 2001 ) has shown that the mechanism which transports mechanical energy from the convection zone to the chromosphere ( to sustain its heating rate ) could also supply the energy needed to heat the corona , and accelerate the sw . the coronal heating problem , hence , is shifted to the problem of the dynamic energization of the chromosphere . in the latter process",
    "the role of flows is found to be critical as warranted by the following observations made in soft x  rays and extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) wavelengths , and recent findings from the _ transition region and coronal explorer ( trace ) _ : the over  density of coronal loops , the chromospheric up  flows of heated plasma , and the localization of the heating function in the lower corona ( schrijver , 1999 ; aschwanden 2001a ; aschwanden 2001b ) .",
    "\\2 ) the connection / coupling of transient events like up  flows and different type jet  like structures to the photosphere dynamics was reported in numerous studies ( see e.g. @xcite and references in ) . in @xcite it was demonstrated that the eruptions of coronal mass ejection is triggered from the low solar atmosphere ( photosphere / chromosphere ) as seen in trace @xmath5 images and with soho michelson doppler imager .",
    "the data of this latest research favor the idea that a catastrophic loss of mhd equilibrium can be the primary driving mechanism for the rapid ejection that has 3 important stages - a relatively stable equilibrium , a loss ( fast , impulsive ) stage , and the final rapid eruption ( associated with substantive changes in the photospheric magnetic flux and white  light morphology ) .",
    "the results of @xcite suggest the coupling between magnetic fields and convective processes that pervades the solar photosphere .",
    "the correlation between photospheric shear flows and flares is also reported in @xcite ; several current models suggest that the former can be responsible for the energy build up of the flares .",
    "\\3 ) in @xcite , the authors report on the low coronal signatures of major solar energetic particle ( sep ) events focusing on flare  associated motions ( observed in soft x  rays ) .",
    "it was underlined that these motions may provide an important link between small  scale energy release and large ",
    "scale explosive events ; the existence of a continuum of acceleration timescales was pointed out . in @xcite the detailed investigation of the dynamical behavior of emerging magnetic flux using three  dimensional mhd numerical simulation was carried out and it was shown that the emergence generates not only vertical but also horizontal flows in the photosphere , both of which contribute to the injection of the magnetic energy and helicity .",
    "the contributions of vertical flows are dominant at the early phase of flux emergence , while horizontal flows become a dominant contributor later . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that solar corona is mainly heated by the magnetic activity in the edges of the network flux clumps that are observed to be riddled with the fine - scale explosive events .",
    "they present that : ( 1 ) at the edges of the network flow clumps there are many transient sheared - core bipoles of the size and lifetime of granules and having transverse field strengths greater than @xmath6 , ( 2 ) @xmath7 of these bipoles are present per supergranule , and ( 3 ) most spicules are produced by explosions of these bipoles .",
    "\\4 ) recent observations also suggest that the energy for coronal heating is very likely a by  product of the outflow of heat from sun s interior through the convection zone  the convection zone acts as a heat engine , converting some of the thermal energy into mechanical and magnetic energy , some of which enters the corona and dissipates into heat .",
    "there are only two obvious energy sources that could power significant flow generation in the chromosphere : the magnetic field ( both large scale and short  scale including turbulence ) , and the thermal pressure of the plasma .",
    "we have already mentioned a few examples of the magnetically driven transient , but sudden flow  generation .",
    "a more quiescent pathway was studied in @xcite showing the possibility of magneto  fluid rearrangement of a relatively constant kinetic energy ( going from an initial high - density  low - velocity state to a low - density  high - velocity stage ) . the mechanisms based on the wave  energy transformation and instabilities",
    "can be operative at later stages of the flow evolution ; these mechanisms could have additional importance for acceleration @xcite .",
    "the main message then , is that to solve the coronal heating problem , the inclusion of processes taking place in the chromosphere and the transition region may be essential . in particular , one must take into account the different time ",
    "scale dynamical stages of the evolution of the primary flow as it passes through specific regions of solar atmosphere areas nested by varying scale ambient magnetic field structures .",
    "the dynamics of the flow must be understood .    in present paper we will show the possibility of flow acceleration / generation in the solar atmosphere based on the dynamical two  fluid model suggested in @xcite .",
    "we will show that there exists an extremely fast stage ( right at the lower chromosphere heights ) giving rise to significant flow acceleration / generation ; it is followed by a quasi  static stage in which the created fast flows are further accelerated via the magnetofluid coupling ( depending on the region of the atmosphere the density could be constant or spatially varying ) .",
    "the detailed nature of accelerated flows will depend on the initial and boundary conditions .",
    "the physical model for flow generation / acceleration is a simplified two  fluid model .",
    "the plasma is quasi ",
    "neutral  electron and proton number densities are nearly equal : @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , but the electron and the proton flow velocities are allowed to be different . neglecting electron inertia ,",
    "these are @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "we assign equal temperatures to the electron and the protons so that the kinetic pressure @xmath12 is given by : @xmath13 .",
    "the analysis can be readily extended later to the more realistic case of different temperatures for different species @xcite .",
    "we understand that when solving the solar wind problem one should use the multi  fluid , multi",
    " dimensional descriptions ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) but we however , believe , that essential features of the primary flow  based physics of its acceleration can be captured with our basic model . very near the photospheric surface , the influence of neutrals and ionization ( and processes of flux emergence etc . ) would not permit just two  fluid approach . a little farther distance ( @xmath14 km ) from the surface , however , we expect that there exist fully ionized and magnetized plasma structures such that the dynamical two  fluid model will capture the essential physics of flow generation",

    "we note that the full viscosity tensor relevant to a magnetized plasma is rather cumbersome , and we do not display it here .",
    "just to have a feel for the importance of spatial variation in viscous dissipation , we display its relatively simple symmetric form .",

    "the observation of pixel  to  pixel variations in the magnetic field indicates that small  scale ( sub  pixel ) distribution of fields changes considerably at larger spatial scales @xcite . at these distances we have different values for the network and for the internetwork fields : ( i )",

    "the choice of initial conditions for our numerical work is guided by the observational evidence presented in the introduction .",
    "our approach is consistent with that of woo , habbal and feldman ( 2004 ) who have argued that the flow of the solar wind is influenced by the closed field structures stressing the self  consistent process of acceleration and trapping / heating of plasma particles in the finely structured atmosphere .",
    "we will dwell , in this paper , on the representative problem of the trapping and acceleration of the primary flow impinging on a single closed - line structure .",

    "note that the 2.5d cartesian nature of our code does not allow us to explore large distances from the surface due to interference with the boundaries .",
    "fortunately that does not translate into a serious shortcoming because much of the action is found to be limited to regions very close to the surface ; the simulation results , therefore , are quite trustworthy in the revelation of the basic processes of interest . in carrying out the simulations an important assumption was made : the diffusion time of magnetic field is longer than the duration of the interaction process .",
    "a short summary of our numerical methods is in order .",

    "the bremsstrahlung radiation accounts for @xmath51 @xcite , using a somewhat modified formula assuming it to be 2 times greater , @xmath52 .",
    "since we were exploring a particular heating mechanism suggested there , no external heating source @xmath53 was needed .",
    "a numerical mesh of @xmath54 points was used for computation .",
    "the corresponding scheme is characterized by second order accuracy with respect to the chosen grid .",
    "the latest observations support the idea that the coronal material is injected discontinuously ( in pulses or bunches , for example ) from lower altitudes into the regions of interest ( e.g. , spicules , jet  like structures ) . a realistic simulation , then , requires a study of the interaction of both temporally and spatially nonuniform initial flows with arcade  like magnetic field structures . these `` close to the actual '' cases represent more vividly the dynamics of the flow acceleration process .",
    "below we study the dynamics of spatially - temporally localized flow ( initially a gaussian , fig .- s 1,3 ) entering the region nested with varying scale arcade  like closed field line structures . for better visualization of the results we take the symmetric case .",
    "the flow is assumed to be initially weak  ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "the initial ambient magnetic field was modelled as a single 2d arcade with circular field lines in the @xmath56@xmath57  plane ( fig.2 for the vector potential / flux function ) .",
    "the arcade field attains its maximum value  @xmath58   at  @xmath59   at its center , and is a decreasing function of the height @xmath57 ( radial direction ) .",
    "this field was assumed to be initially uniform in time .",
    "when doing so , we choose the parameters to satisfy the observational constraint that , over a period of some tens of minutes , the location of the trapping / acceleration must have a relatively smooth evolution .",
    "the final shape and location of the structure of the associated @xmath60 , for example will be naturally defined by its material source , by the process dynamics , and by the initial field @xmath61 .",
    "we use the following representation for the magnetic field :  @xmath62   and for given geometry  @xmath63 . from numerous runs on the flow  field evolution , we have chosen to display pictorially the results corresponding to the following initial and boundary conditions :  @xmath64 and flow parameters :  @xmath65 .  the background plasma density @xmath66 .",

    "guided by observations we assume that the initial velocity field has a pulse  like distribution ( fig.3 ) with a time duration ( life  time ) @xmath70 @xmath71 .",
    "to illustrate the acceleration of initial flows ( extremely weak ) , we have modelled several cases with different initial and boundary conditions .",
    "the dynamical picture is strongly dependent on the relative strengths of the initial flow pressure and the magnetic field strength .",
    "our typical representative example is the evolution of a symmetric weak up ",
    "flow with its peak located in the central region of a single closed magnetic field structure ( location of field maximum @xmath64 ) ( figs . 1 - 3 ) .",
    "( 4 - 8 ) , in which we give the @xmath72 contour plots of all the relevant fields ( @xmath73 ) , contain the essence of the simulation .",
    "we find that the acceleration is significant in the vicinity of the field ",
    "maximum with strong deformation of field lines and energy re  distribution . in this very region ,",
    "the simulations show cooling of the flow with serious density redistribution : part of the flow is trapped in the maximum field localization area , accumulated , cooled and accelerated .",
    "the accelerated flow reaches @xmath74km / s value in less than @xmath75s ( in agreement with recent observations @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the accelerated flow is decoupled from the mother flow , and is localized in a distinguishable region with dimensions @xmath76 starting at a distance @xmath2 from the interaction surface .",
    "the time for reaching the quasi ",
    "equilibrium parameters is determined by the initial and boundary conditions ( this conclusion is general for all cases ) .    in a stationary analysis to be presented in the next sub ",
    "section , we will attempt to derive the characteristic steady state parameters ( like the distance from the surface ) of the simulated system .",
    "extensive simulation experiments show that , when viscosity and heat flux effects are included , the flow acceleration evolution parameters depend strongly on @xmath34 , the parameter measuring the strength of the hall term in the two - fluid equations .",
    "a very interesting and far - reaching result is that the final parameters of the accelerated flow are practically independent of the initial flow  characteristics ( fig .- s 4 - 8 ) ; only the initial fast stage of acceleration up to @xmath77 is slightly different for different primary flows .",
    "simulation results for 2 different initial life ",
    "times of the flow ( @xmath78  left panel and @xmath79  right panel in fig .-",
    "s 4 - 8 ) illustrate this feature .",
    "we also found that at some critical time , the solutions split into two parts ; all fields , the magnetic ( fig .- s 4,5 ) , the density ( fig.6 ) , the velocity ( fig.7 ) and temperature ( fig.8 ) exhibit bifurcation .",
    "this process persists for different initial conditions . in fig.9",

    "the same maximum values of all fields are plotted versus the initial life  time ( @xmath70 ) of the flow for different time ",
    "frames ( @xmath82 ( rose ) ) .",
    "these pictures clearly demonstrate that the accelerated mother flow bifurcates into 2 separate fast daughter  flows ( after an initial acceleration stage ) modifying significantly the original arcade structure .",
    "the characteristic fields undergo rather similar dynamics for flow pulses with different initial life  times .",
    "it should be emphasized that now the maxima of these parameters are localized not along the initial b ",
    "maximum but on both sides of it and shifted along height ( in the localization areas of each accelerated daughter flow with newly created b  maxima and currents ) .",
    "after the initial acceleration stage , the magnetic energy maxima remain practically unchanged up to some `` blow  up '' time ( @xmath83 ) at which the gradients become too steep and the simulation results cease to be meaningful .",
    "the same result holds for the maxima of the transverse and parallel magnetic field energies ( with @xmath84 accuracy ) . for fixed @xmath85 ) the maximum values of each parameter ( local in space ) exhibit practically similar dynamics ( independent of the initial flow life ",
    "time ) reaching similar numbers at near  critical time .",
    "this picture persists for different initial @xmath85 ) . testing the conservation of the total energy of the system as it evolves in time",
    "also shows that the simulation results can be trusted only up to the blow  up time ; as one approaches this time the energy conservation no longer holds . to study longer time dynamics",
    ", the code will need improvement .",
    "we will soon offer a possible explanation of these results through a simple equilibrium analysis .",
    "we are now in a position to list the most interesting and distinguishable new results found in a 2.5d simulation of the two  fluid equations ( containing various dissipative and short  scale effects ) solved for different initial and boundary conditions :    1 .",
    "a primary flow , even with a very slow initial speed ( @xmath86km / s locally sub  alfvnic ) is accelerated when it interacts with an arcade  like closed magnetic field structure .",
    "the effect is strong in the strong field region ( initially the arcade center ) .",
    "this is a common feature independent of the arcade  characteristics , and the shape of the initial flow .",
    "when viscosity and heat  flux are ignored , the time needed for the flow to acquire reasonable amount of energy is practically infinite .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that without dissipation , the energy transfer through the short  scales introduced by the two  fluid effects is not operative unless special conditions for catastrophic processes pertain .",
    "3 .   for realistic  @xmath34  ( measuring the strength of the hall term ) the heat flux and viscosity effects cause a re  distribution of magnetic , flow kinetic and thermal energies in the arcade region in reasonable times  @xmath87s .",
    "4 .   during the redistribution",
    ", the arcade field is modified ; the thermal and magnetic field energies are converted to flow energy locally . the time ",
    "scale for generating a reasonably fast flow ( @xmath88km / s )   is dictated by  @xmath34 .",
    "for a given initial  @xmath89 , the larger the  @xmath34 , the faster the flow generation .",
    "the density is non  uniformly redistributed within the arcade span .",
    "5 .   at some specific `` critical time ''  @xmath90  the accelerated flow bifurcates into two separate fast flows . at this moment",
    "the arcade is also split in two , each with its share of the accumulated particles .",
    "two fast spicule  like structures , carrying vorticity and current , are decoupled from the mother flow .",
    "their densities are similar to the initial density of the mother  flow .",
    "6 .   initially",
    "the amplification of the flow depends on the flow @xmath91 , the ratio of the thermal and the magnetic field energy .",
    "the distance from the interaction surface where the bifurcation occurs is  @xmath2 .",
    "it is interesting to mention that this height is lower than the heights of the base of a typical hot coronal structure ( @xcite and references therein ) and it seems to be comparable to the latest observational findings @xcite .",
    "initially the fast flow localizes in the center of the original arcade , starting from this distance .",
    "after the bifurcation several flows appear with distinguishable dimensions  ( @xmath92 )  practically on similar heights . 8 .   for fixed initial @xmath93 , the final speed of accelerated flow and the picture of the modified field structure",
    "are independent of the initial flow life  time .",
    "this result seems extremely important in connection with the observed flows in the lower atmosphere . at  @xmath94s velocities reach  @xmath95km / s  or even greater ( @xmath96km / s )  values .",
    "such result persists for different  @xmath97 .",
    "we note here that at any quasi  equilibrium stage of the acceleration process , the nascent intermittent flows will blend and interact with pre  existing varying scale closed field structures ( recall the fine structure of the solar atmosphere ) ; the `` new '' flows could be trapped by other structures with strong / weak magnetic fields participating in creating different dynamical scenarios : heating of the new structure @xcite could result , or an escape channel could be created @xcite .",
    "instabilities , generation of waves could also be triggered .",

    "independent dissipationless approach will not be valid .",
    "the bernoulli equation  ( [ eq : flows19 - 1 ] ) , however , clearly reveals the origin of the very fast first stage of dynamical acceleration found in the simulations . from eq.([eq : flows19 ] ) we also see that the distance over which the catastrophe appears is determined by the strength of gravity , @xmath135 .",
    "eventual amplification of the flow is determined by the local value of  @xmath91 .",
    "these simple consequences of the bernoulli equation explain one of the most important findings of the simulation : for a fixed initial temperature , the final characteristic parameters of the accelerated flow ( quasi  equilibrium after the fast stage of acceleration ) do not depend on its initial state .",
    "for these gross features of the system , the value of  @xmath136 as long as it is finite , is also quite irrelevant , it just determines how fast the transverse components of magnetic and velocity fields oscillate .",
    "however when dissipation is present ,  @xmath136 through the mediation of short - scale physics , plays a crucial role in the acceleration / heating processes .    in connection with this result",
    "it is interesting to mention that according to latest observations on the quasi ",
    "equilibrium coronal loops , the so called quasi ",
    "periodic intensity oscillations are found to propagate upwards with speeds of the order of the ( adiabatic / isothermal ) coronal sound speed ( @xcite and the references therein ) .    for structures with ( @xmath137 ) ,",
    "there are two distinct scenarios for eruptive events in the current framework : ( 1 ) when a `` slowly '' evolving structure finds itself in a state of no equilibrium and ( 2 ) when the process of creating a long  lived hot structure is prematurely aborted ; the flow shrinks / distorts the structure that suddenly shines and/or releases energy or ejects particles .",
    "the latter mechanism requires a detailed time ",
    "dependent treatment .",
    "the semi  equilibrium , collisionless magnetofluid treatment pertains only to the former case @xcite . in the references",
    "cited , the conditions for catastrophic transformations of an original db ( double beltrami state ) were investigated .",
    "it was shown that when the total energy of the original state exceeds a critical value , the db equilibrium suddenly relaxes to a single beltrami state corresponding to the larger macroscopic scale ; at the transition , much of the magnetic energy @xmath138 of the original state is converted to heat / flow kinetic energy .",
    "we have developed a 2.5 dimensional dynamical code for two - fluid equations .",
    "the two fluid equations contain the hall term ( @xmath139 ) , the ion vorticity , heatflux and viscosity effects .",
    "we have used the code for a systematic study of particle acceleration and energy re  distribution phenomena associated with the interaction of a primary plasma flow with closed field  line magnetic structures .",
    "we also developed simple analytical arguments to explain and understand essential features of the simulation results .",
    "the simulation and analytical effort have led us to several far  reaching results for the understanding of the solar atmosphere . even at the cost of some repetition",
    ", we list the most important ones : + ( 1 ) a primary plasma flow ( locally sub - alfvnic ) is accelerated when it impinges on an emerging / ambient arcade  like closed magnetic field structure .",
    "the effect is strong in the strong field region .",
    "it is found that the final state of the flow is quite insensitive to the details of initial and boundary conditions ; the latter simply dictate the time ",
    "scale at which significant flow  energy is generated .",
    "+ ( 2 ) it is shown that there is a redistribution of magnetic , flow- kinetic and thermal energies in the arcade region so that the original arcade field is modified , and thermal and field energies are converted to flow energy . the time ",
    "scale of the fast ( @xmath74km / s ) flow generation is dictated by @xmath34 , the measure of the hall term .",
    "+ ( 3 ) it is found that at some specific time the accelerated flow bifurcates into 2 separate fast flows with an accompanying split of the arcade each containing its share of the accumulated particles .",
    "+ ( 4 ) initially the amplification of the flow depends on @xmath91 as proven by the 1d analysis ; it is shown for the first time that the distance on which it happens is @xmath2 ( independent of @xmath136 ) from the interaction surface .",
    "later the fast flow localizes ( with dimensions @xmath3 ) in the upper center of the original arcade .",
    "+ ( 5 ) it is shown that for fixed initial  @xmath93  the final speed ( @xmath4 ) of the accelerated flow , and the shape of the modified field structure are independent of the initial flow life  time .",
    "many of these parameters can be approximately calculated by analysis .",
    "+    we have shown possible pathways for both dynamical and steady generation of fast flows .",
    "the cold flows originating , for example , in the lower chromosphere acquire energy as they meet and interact with emerging/ ambient magnetic fluxes ; the trapping of an ionized @xmath140ev plasma by network/ inter  network structures takes place at the same time . in the presence of dissipation , these flows are likely to play a fundamental role in the heating of the finely structured solar atmosphere . the explicit purpose of this paper , however , was to demonstrate the generation of flows in the lower atmosphere feeding on the ambient magnetic energy .",
    "the flows , in turn , provide a steady and assured source of matter and energy for the formation and primary heating of the corona as well as for the creation of the solar wind .",
    "the agreement of our preliminary results with the observation data lends credence and promise to attempts , based on the exploitation of sub  coronal flows , to tackle unresolved problems like the coronal heating and origin of the solar wind .",
    "we believe that the chromospheric mass outflows , spicules , explosive events in chromosphere , micro and nano  flares , large coronal flares , erupting prominences and cmes may happen separately but can also be parts of a more global dynamic process of coronal specific regional formation .",
