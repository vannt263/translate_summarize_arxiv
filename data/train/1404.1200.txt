    "a warped extra dimension model proposed by randall and sundrum ( rs ) is one of the attractive candidates to solve the gauge hierarchy problem in the standard model ( sm ) naturally  @xcite .",
    "the model is given in the five - dimensional space - time where one warped extra dimension is compactified on the orbifold @xmath6 .",
    "the space - time metric is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 ) , @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the coordinate of four - dimensional space - time , that of a fifth dimension , and the @xmath11 curvature , respectively .",
    "the minkowski metric is @xmath12 and @xmath13 is called a warp factor .",
    "two 3-branes are located at @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "they are called the uv brane ( @xmath14 ) and the ir brane ( @xmath16 ) . in the original rs model all the sm fields",
    "are confined on the ir brane and only graviton is allowed to propagate into the bulk .",
    "there are some variants of the rs model where some of sm fields propagate in the extra dimension  @xcite . with this setup ,",
    "the four dimensional planck mass @xmath17 is expressed by a fundamental parameter @xmath18 in the five dimensional einstein - hilbert action as @xmath19 as a result , an effective mass parameter in the ir brane is given as @xmath20 , and the gauge hierarchy problem could be solved naturally when the distance between uv and ir branes are stabilized by @xmath21 .",
    "goldberger and wise have proposed an attractive mechanism to stabilize the distance between two branes introducing a bulk scalar field which has scalar potentials on both branes  @xcite . minimizing the scalar potentials on the branes",
    ", the distance between two branes takes appropriate value ( @xmath22 ) without fine - tuning of the parameters in the scalar potentials . in four dimensional effective theory of the original rs model ,",
    "there are two new particles beyond the standard model .",
    "one is a spin-2 graviton ( and its kaluza - klein excitations ) and the other is a scalar - field radion @xmath23 which is a metric fluctuation along the extra dimension .",
    "the radion acquires the mass of the order of the electroweak scale due to the goldberger - wise mechanism and it could be a lightest extra particle in the rs model  @xcite .",
    "the radion , therefore , is expected to be the first signature of warped extra dimension models in direct search experiments such as the lhc .",
    "phenomenology of the radion can be characterized by two parameters , a radion mass @xmath24 and a scale parameter @xmath3 .",
    "the search experiments of the higgs boson at the lhc give stringent constraints on the parameters of the radion .",
    "as will be shown later , the radion couples to the trace part of the energy - momentum tensor of the sm . thus it is known that the interactions of the radion to the sm particles such as electroweak gauge bosons ( @xmath25 ) and fermions are similar to those of the higgs boson , except for the scale parameters in the couplings . on the other hand ,",
    "the interactions of radion to photons and gluons have additional source from the trace anomaly of the energy - momentum tensor in addition to the 1-loop contributions from @xmath26 boson and/or fermions as in the sm .",
    "furthermore , there could be a mixing between the radion and the sm higgs boson through the scalar - curvature mixing term in the four - dimensional effective action  @xcite . according to these characteristic features of the radion interactions ,",
    "there have been studied the phenomenological aspects of the radion in various colliders  @xcite .",
    "it has been reported that the higgs boson mass @xmath27 is @xmath28 at atlas  @xcite and @xmath29 at cms  @xcite , respectively , and there is no signature of any other scalar particles up to @xmath30 from the @xmath31 mode .",
    "thus one can apply the results of the higgs search experiments at the lhc to constrain the mass and couplings of the radion .",
    "recently , the bounds on the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath3 were studied in light of the higgs boson discovery at the lhc using @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "it was found that constraint on the parameter @xmath3 for the high - mass region of the radion ( @xmath33 ) from the @xmath31 mode is much severe than results in the previous studies  @xcite .",
    "it is , however , pointed out that the radion in low - mass region ( @xmath34 ) is not constrained at the lhc , i.e. , the higgs search in the @xmath35 channel at the lhc is less sensitive to a relatively light radion , since the @xmath36 mode dominates over the other decay modes in this region which suppresses the branching ratio of @xmath37 .",
    "then it is worth examining possibilities to search for the radion in the low - mass region in collider experiments . in this paper , we study production and decay of the radion at a photon collider which has been proposed as an option of an @xmath38 linear collider such as the ilc  @xcite .",
    "it has been studied that the photon collider has an advantage to distinguish the radion produced in the @xmath35 collision from the sm higgs boson production  @xcite supposing the sm higgs boson is relatively heavy .",
    "the production of radion in the light - by - light scattering at the lhc has been discussed in ref .",
    "we show that the decay of radion in low - mass region into gluon pair is a promissing channel for its discovery at photon collider .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .  2",
    ", we briefly review the interactions of radion to sm fields with emphasis on the difference from those of the sm higgs boson .",
    "production and decay of the radion at the photon collider are discussed in sec .",
    "we show our numerical results in sec .  4 where a discovery potential of the radion at the photon collider is discussed quantitatively .",
    "is devoted to summary and discussion .",
    "the radion field represents a fluctuation of the distance between the uv and ir branes . taking account of a fluctuation along the fifth dimension",
    ", the metric is written as  @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a scalar perturbation . a canonically normalized radion field @xmath23 is given by  @xcite @xmath41 where the scale parameter @xmath3 is @xmath42  @xcite . the radion couples to the trace part of the energy - momentum tensor of the sm .",
    "then , the interaction lagrangian of the radion is given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the trace of energy - momentum tensor of the sm which is given as @xmath45 where the first line in r.h.s .",
    "of ( [ eq : trace_sm_emtensor ] ) is obtained from the energy - momentum tensor of the sm .",
    "two terms in the second line of ( [ eq : trace_sm_emtensor ] ) come from the trace anomaly for photons ( @xmath46 ) and gluons ( @xmath47 ) , respectively , and the ellipsis denote the higher - order terms . the number of active quark - flavors is denoted by @xmath48 in our analysis . ] .",
    "we can see from ( [ eq : trace_sm_emtensor ] ) that , except for the trace anomaly terms , the interactions of the radion to the sm fields are very similar to those of the sm higgs boson .",
    "the interactions of the radion are , however , suppressed by the scale parameter @xmath49 which corresponds to the higgs vacuum expectation value , @xmath50 , in the interactions of the sm higgs boson to other sm fields .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , in general , the radion and the higgs boson can mix after the electroweak symmetry breaking through the scalar - curvature term in the four - dimensional effective action  @xcite . in our following study",
    ", however , we do not consider the mixing between the radion and the higgs boson , since the current experimental results of the higgs searches at the lhc tell us that the measured branching ratios of the higgs boson are consistent with those in the sm  @xcite , so that we can neglect the radion - higgs mixing in a good approximation .",
