    "both magnetic and gravitational fields play an important role in determining the evolution of the matter in many astrophysical objects . in highly conducting plasma , the magnetic field",

    "even when the magnetic field is weak initially , the magnetic field grows short time scales and influences the gas dynamics of the system .",
    "this is particulary important for a compact object such as a black hole or a neutron star .",
    "relativistic jets have been observed or postulated in various astrophysical objects , including active galactic nuclei ( agns ) ( e.g. , urry & pavovani 1995 ; ferrari 1998 ; blandford 2002 ) , microquasars in our galaxy ( e.g. , mirabel & rodrguez 1999 ) , and gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) ( e.g. , zhang & mszros 2004 ; piran 2005 ; mszros 2006 ) .",
    "the most promising mechanisms for producing the relativistic jets involve the magnetohydrodynamic centrifugal acceleration and/or magnetic pressure driven acceleration from the accretion disk with the compact objects ( e.g. , blandford & payne 1982 ; fukue 1990 ) , or the extraction of rotating energy from the rotating black hole ( penrose 1969 ; blandford & znajek 1977 ) .",
    "in addition , the differential rotation of the plasma in the disk raises the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) , which plays an important role for the transportation of angular momentum from the disk due to the associated turbulence in accretion disks ( balbus & hawley 1991 , 1998 ) .",
    "it is much more efficient than the internal disk transport .",

    "these intense magnetic fields are expected to affect the internal structure of the neutron star ( e.g. , bocquet et al .",

    "figure [ f1 ] shows the @xmath193 norm of the error in @xmath194 ( @xmath195 in eq ( [ eq4 - 1 ] ) ) for runs using the mc slope limiter , minmod slope limiter , ceno , and ppm reconstructions as the computational zone number @xmath192 is increased .",
    "courant number is 0.5 in all simulations .",
    "all reconstruction schemes show that the global order of convergence of the code is second order in small computational zone number @xmath192 and tend to flatter than second order convergence .",
    "even we use the higher order reconstruction schemes such as ceno or ppm reconstructions , the global order of convergence of the code is second order .",
    "it is because we use the flux - ct scheme to maintain divergence - free magnetic field .",
    "it has second - order accuracy .",
    "even all reconstruction schemes show the second order convergence , mc slope - limiter and ppm reconstructions are more accurate than minmod slope limiter and ceno reconstruction schemes .",
    "shock - tube tests are the most basic test problems for mhd ( hd ) codes .",
    "large sets of test - problems in relativistic mhd have been performed over the years ( i.e. , komissarov 1999a ; balsara 2001 ) . in some test problems",
    "the exact solution of the riemann problem in relativistic mhd has been calculated by giacomazzo & rezzolla ( 2006 ) .",
    "we perform eight simulations of @xmath196 cases which exact solutions obtained by giacomazzo & rezzolla ( 2006 )",
    ". therefore we can compare the simulation results with the exact solutions directly .",
    "all tests start with discontinuous initial data at @xmath197 ( see table [ table1 ] ) and with homogenous profiles on either side in cartesian coordinates .",
    "we simulate from @xmath198 to @xmath199 with different reconstruction schemes , where @xmath200 is specified in table [ table1 ] for each case .",
    "the fluid satisfies a @xmath83-law eos . in all cases we use 400 computational zones with a courant factor of @xmath201 .",
    "the results of the simulations are shown in fig [ f3a ] -[f10b ] .",
    "all results show good agreement with the exact solutions .",
    "however , some small discontinuities and large shocks can not be resolved exactly .",
    "this means that we need more computational zones to resolve all small discontinuities and large shocks exactly .",
    "generally , the minmod slope limiter and ceno reconstructions are more diffusive than the mc slope limiter and ppm reconstructions because of the properties of the minmod function . on the other hand , although the mc slope limiter and ppm reconstructions can resolve sharp discontinuities well , some small oscillations are seen at the discontinuities .",
    "the ppm reconstruction is the most accurate scheme to detect the discontinuities .",
    "our previous grmhd code of koide ( 2003 ) could not handle some extreme cases of relativistic mhd shock - tube tests shown in table [ table1 ] such as kommissarov : shock - tube test1 , balsara test2 and balsara test3 for large discontinuities of the pressure and magnetic field , kommissarov : collision test and balsara test3 for the highly relativistic flow even using different recovery methods such as noble 2d method .",
    "however the new grmhd code successfully handles the relativistic mhd shock - tube tests in table [ table1 ] .",
    "therefore the new grmhd code has substantial improvements over our previous grmhd code ( e.g. , koide 2003 ) and can operate in a regime with large discontinuities of physical quantities ( 4 order difference of pressure in komissarov : collision test and balsara test3 ) , strong magnetic field ( @xmath202 and @xmath203 in balsara test 3 , where @xmath204 , @xmath205 , and @xmath206 ) and highly relativistic flow ( @xmath207 in balsara test 4 ) .",
    "the limitation to handle the regimes of high lorentz factor and of highly magnetized depends on the schemes to solve the grmhd equations .",
    "next we check the code to verify it numerically maintains the time - dependent system of equations describing the stationary , spherically symmetric accretion of a perfect fluid onto a schwarzschild black hole in the presence of a radial magnetic field .",
    "spherically symmetric accretion ( bondi flow ) onto the fixed background of the schwarzschild black hole has an analytic solution ( e.g. , shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) that can be compared with the results of our code .",
    "this test has been used by several authors ( de villiers & hawley 2003 ; gammie et al .",
    "2003 ; duez et al . 2005 ; shibata & sekiguchi 2005 ; antn et al .",
    "2006 ) in the validation of their grmhd codes .",
    "the initial setup consists of a perfect fluid which satisfies a @xmath83-law eos with @xmath208 .",
    "the analytic solution is calculated in a manner similar to koide et al .",
    "( 1999 ) with constant parameter @xmath209 and @xmath210 .",
    "the critical point of free - falling flow is located at @xmath211 .",
    "the radial magnetic field component is chosen to satisfy the divergence - free condition .",
    "its strength is determined by the parameter @xmath212 at the critical radius of the flow .",
    "these initial conditions are evolved in time in a uniform radial gird covering the region @xmath213 .",
    "figure [ f2 ] shows the @xmath193 norm of the radial velocity @xmath214 ( @xmath215 in eq .",
    "( [ eq4 - 1 ] ) ) of the difference between the exact solution and the final state ( @xmath216 , @xmath217 ) in the @xmath218 case .",
    "the calculation of @xmath193 norm is taken in the region @xmath219 to exclude boundary effects .",
    "the mc slope limiter and minmod slope limiter reconstructions show that the global order of convergence of the code is second order .",
    "the mc slope limiter reconstruction is more accurate than the minmod slope limiter reconstruction .",
    "we have developed a new three - dimensional grmhd code , raishin , by using a conservative high resolution shock - capturing scheme .",
    "the numerical fluxes are calculated using the hll approximate riemann solver scheme .",
    "the flux - interpolated , constrained transport scheme is used to maintain a divergence - free magnetic field .",
    "several reconstruction and time advance schemes can be chosen for the numerical accuracy and computational resources .",
    "we have described several test problems in both special and general relativity .",
    "they have shown significant improvements over our previous grmhd code ( koide 2003 ) .",
    "our new grmhd code can perform in the regimes of high lorentz factor ( @xmath220 ) and high magnetic field ( @xmath221 ) , and in the presence of large discontinuity of density , pressure and magnetic field .",
    "we have compared the results of several reconstruction schemes .",
    "the code is second - order accurate even when we use the higher order reconstruction schemes such as ceno and ppm .",
    "nevertheless , higher - order reconstruction schemes can provide more accurate results for some applications .",
    "the ppm reconstruction scheme allows the well - resolved detection of sharp discontinuities .",
    "we found the limitation to handle the regimes of high lorentz factor and of highly magnetized depends on the schemes to solve the grmhd equations .",
    "we have performed several simulations of non - rotating and rotating black hole systems with a thin accretion disk ( mizuno et al .",
    "the simulation results show the formation of jets driven by the lorentz force and the gas pressure .",
    "it appears that the rotating black hole creates an additional , faster , and more collimated inner outflow beside an outflow generated by the rotating accretion disk in the non - rotating black hole .",
    "thus , kinematic jet structure could be a sensitive function of the black hole rotation .",
    "our new grmhd code has proven to be accurate in second order and has successfully passed all applied tests including highly relativistic cases , and highly magnetized cases in both special and general relativity .",
    "we plan to apply this code to a number of high - energy astrophysical phenomena involving highly relativistic flows or compact objects with strong gravitational fields and magnetic fields .",
