    "top - quark measurements are of central importance to the lhc physics programme .",
    "the production of top - quark pairs in @xmath0 collisions is a process which is situated at the boundary between the standard model ( sm ) and what might lie beyond it . within the sm , top quarks",
    "are predicted to almost always decay to a @xmath5-quark and a @xmath4-boson , that can further decay leptonically or hadronically .",
    "the final states are thus characterised by the presence of two ( dilepton ) , one ( single lepton ) or no leptons ( all hadronic channel ) . with an integrated luminosity of @xmath6 of @xmath0 collisions recorded by the atlas detector at @xmath1 in the first half of 2011 a variety of precision and new measurement",
    "have been obtained .",
    "within the sm the @xmath8 production cross - section at @xmath1 is calculated to be at approximate nnlo for a top - quark mass of @xmath9 . a precise determination of @xmath7 tests these perturbative qcd predictions .",
    "first measurements of @xmath7 at the lhc have been reported by atlas and cms with 3 @xmath10 and 35 @xmath10 . with approximately twenty times",
    "more data the single lepton , dilepton and lepton+@xmath11 channels have been measured . in the single - lepton channel",
    "a multivariate likelihood discriminant is constructed using template distributions of four variables  @xcite .",
    "data are split according to lepton flavour and number of jets .",
    "a profile likelihood technique is used to extract @xmath7 and constrain the systematic effects from data .",
    "the result is @xmath12 pb , the most precise measurement of @xmath7 at lhc to date . in the dilepton channel a cut - and - count method is employed  @xcite .",
    "the background contribution from drell - yan production is suppressed by requiring for same - flavour events large @xmath13 and for @xmath14 events large @xmath15 , the scalar sum of jet and lepton transverse energies .",
    "remaining drell - yan events and background from fake leptons are estimated with data - driven methods .",
    "the combined cross - section in the three channels is @xmath16 pb . a second measurement requiring at least one @xmath5-jet yields a consistent result .",
    "a cross - section measurement is also performed in final states with an isolated muon and a hadronically decaying @xmath11-lepton  @xcite .",
    "at least two jets , one of them @xmath5-tagged , are required .",
    "the analysis utilises a multivariate technique based on boosted decision trees to identify @xmath11-leptons and extracts @xmath17 pb .",
    "single top - quark production has been explored in the three channels ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) . for the @xmath18-channel measurement a cut - based analysis exploiting the two- and three - jet bins",
    "is performed and exactly one @xmath5-tag is required  @xcite .",
    "an excess of top candidates is observed over antitop candidates .",
    "the measured cross - section is @xmath21 pb in agreement with the sm prediction and has been cross - checked with an analysis based on neural networks . for the search for the associated production of a top quark and a @xmath4-boson only the leptonic decays of the two @xmath4 bosons are considered  @xcite .",
    "a simple cut - based approach is used to select the @xmath19 contribution . at the 95% c.l .",
    "@xmath22 pb for the observed ( expected ) upper limit . for the search in the s - channel single top - quark production two b - jets",
    "are required  @xcite . with a cut - based analysis an upper limit of @xmath23 pb",
    "is obtained at 95% c.l .",
    "single top - quark production in the @xmath18-(left  @xcite ) , @xmath19-(centre  @xcite ) , and @xmath20-channel  ( right  @xcite ) , respectively",
    "the top - quark mass ( @xmath24 ) has been measured using a two - dimensional template analysis in the single - lepton channel that determines @xmath24 together with a global jet energy scale factor  @xcite .",
    "combining the electron and muon channels and the results from the 2010 atlas data , the top - quark mass is measured to be @xmath25 .",
    "the top - antitop charge asymmetry is measured in the single - lepton channel  @xcite .",
    "a kinematic likelihood is used to reconstruct the  event topology .",
    "after background subtraction , a bayesian unfolding procedure is performed to correct for acceptance and detector effects . the charge asymmetry observable @xmath26 is based on the difference of the absolute values of top and antitop rapidities , @xmath27 .",
    "it is measured to be @xmath28 , in agreement with the sm prediction of @xmath29 spin correlation in @xmath8 events are studied in the dilepton channel  @xcite .",
    "the spin information is accessed via the angular distributions of its decay products .",
    "the difference in azimuthal angle between the two charged leptons is compared to the expected distributions in the sm , and to the case where the top quarks are produced with uncorrelated spin . using the helicity basis as the quantisation axis",
    ", the strength of the spin correlation between the top and antitop quark is measured to be @xmath30 , which is in agreement with the nlo sm prediction .",
    "helicities of @xmath4-bosons in top - quark decays have been measured in the single- and di - lepton channels  @xcite .",
    "at least one of the jets in the single - lepton final state is required to be @xmath5-tagged .",
    "the results are in agreement with the sm .",
    "as the polarisation of the @xmath4-bosons in top - quark decays is sensitive to the structure of the @xmath31-vertex the measurements are used to set limits on anomalous contributions to the @xmath31-vertex .",
    "a search for new phenomena in @xmath8 events with large @xmath13 is carried out in the single - lepton channel  @xcite .",
    "the results are interpreted in terms of a model where new top - quark partners are pair - produced and each decay to a top quark and a long - lived undetected neutral particle .",
    "the data are found to be consistent with sm expectations . a limit at 95% c.l .",
    "is set excluding a cross - section times branching ratio of 1.1 pb for a top - partner mass of 420 @xmath32 and a neutral particle mass less than 10 @xmath32 . in a search for high mass @xmath8 resonances in the dilepton channel",
    "@xcite no excess above the sm expectation is observed .",
    "upper limits at the 95% c.l are set on the cross - section times branching ratio of the resonance decaying to @xmath8 pairs as a function of the resonance pole mass .",
    "a lower mass limit of 0.84 @xmath33 is set for the case of a kaluza - klein gluon resonance in the randall - sundrum model .",
