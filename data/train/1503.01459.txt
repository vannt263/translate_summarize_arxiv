    "<S> the transient response of an elastic cylinder to a laser impact is studied . </S>",
    "<S> when the laser source is a line perpendicular to the cylinder axis , modes guided along the cylinder are generated . for a millimetric steel cylinder up to ten narrow resonances </S>",
    "<S> can be locally detected by laser interferometry below 8 mhz . </S>",
    "<S> most of these resonances correspond to zero - group velocity guided modes while a few others can be ascribed to thickness modes . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the theory describing the propagation of elastic waves in an isotropic cylinder is not sufficient to precisely predict the resonance spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the texture of such elongated structure manifest as elastic anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a transverse isotropic ( ti ) model is used to calculate the dispersion curves and compare them with the measured one , obtained by moving the source along the cylinder . </S>",
    "<S> the five elastic constants of a ti cylinder are adjusted leading to a good agreement between measured and theoretical dispersion curves . then , all the resonance frequencies are satisfactorily identified . </S>"
