    "in a recent paper  @xcite all pairs of recurrence relations in which two hahn , dual hahn or racah polynomials with different parameters appear were classified .",
    "we used the term ( dual ) hahn doubles or racah doubles for such pairs .",
    "they were shown to correspond to christoffel - geronimus pairs of ( dual ) hahn or racah polynomials  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we shall consider a special case of a racah double .",
    "this special case is chosen in such a way that the related two - diagonal ( jacobi ) matrix @xmath0 has a very simple spectrum . the eigenvectors of @xmath0 can then be written in terms of the corresponding racah polynomials .",
    "the main reason to study the special case considered here is because it is particularly interesting in the framework of finite oscillator models .",
    "finite oscillator models were introduced and investigated in a number of papers , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the standard example is the @xmath1 oscillator model  @xcite . in brief , this model is based on the @xmath1 algebra with basis elements @xmath2 , @xmath3 satisfying @xmath4=\\pm j_\\pm , \\qquad [ j_+,j_-]=2j_0,\\ ] ] with unitary representations of dimension @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 is integer or half - integer ) .",
    "recall that the oscillator lie algebra can be considered as an associative algebra ( with unit element @xmath7 ) with three generators @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( the hamiltonian , the position and the momentum operator ) subject to @xmath11 = -i \\hat p , \\qquad [ \\hat h,\\hat p ] = i \\hat q , \\qquad [ \\hat q , \\hat p]=i , \\label{hqp}\\ ] ] in units with mass and frequency both equal to  1 , and @xmath12 .",
    "the first two are the hamilton - lie equations ; the third the canonical commutation relation .",
    "the canonical commutation relation is not compatible with a finite - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "following this , one speaks of a finite oscillator model if @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 belong to some algebra such that the hamilton - lie equations are satisfied and such that the spectrum of @xmath8 in representations of that algebra is equidistant  @xcite .    in the @xmath1 model ,",
    "one chooses @xmath13 these indeed satisfy @xmath14 = -i \\hat p$ ] , @xmath15 = i \\hat q$ ] , and the spectrum of @xmath8 is equidistant in the representation @xmath16 labeled by @xmath6 ( and given by @xmath17 ; @xmath18 ) .",
    "clearly , for this model the position operator @xmath19 also has a finite spectrum in the representation @xmath16 given by @xmath20 . in terms of the standard @xmath21-eigenvectors @xmath22",
    ", the eigenvectors of @xmath9 can be written as @xmath23 the coefficients @xmath24 are the position wavefunctions , and in this model  @xcite they turn out to be ( normalized ) symmetric krawtchouk polynomials , @xmath25 .",
    "the shape of the these wavefunctions is reminiscent of those of the canonical oscillator : under the limit @xmath26 they coincide with the canonical wavefunctions in terms of hermite polynomials .    in the present paper",
    "we develop a related but new finite oscillator model , following the ideas of  @xcite where a dual hahn double was used to extend the @xmath1 model .",
    "the recent classification  @xcite of all ( dual ) hahn doubles and racah doubles opens the way to investigate such new models .",
    "the basic ingredient is a special racah double from this classification , that is explained and analysed in section  2 . in section  3",
    "we study the related finite oscillator model , and in particular we focus on some properties of the discrete position wavefunctions .",
    "racah polynomials @xmath27 of degree @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) in the variable @xmath30 are defined by  @xcite @xmath31 where one of the denominator parameters should be @xmath32 : @xmath33 herein , the function @xmath34 is the generalized hypergeometric series  @xcite : @xmath35 where we use the common notation for pochhammer symbols  @xcite @xmath36 for @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "note that in  ( [ racah ] ) , the series is terminating because of the appearance of the negative integer @xmath39 as a numerator parameter .",
    "racah polynomials satisfy a ( discrete ) orthogonality relation ( depending on the choice of which parameter relates to @xmath32 )  @xcite . for the choice",
    "@xmath40 we have @xmath41 where @xmath42 under certain restrictions such as @xmath43 and @xmath44 or @xmath45 , which ensure positivity of the functions @xmath46 and @xmath47 , we can define orthonormal racah functions as follows : @xmath48    after settling this notation , let us turn to a result from  @xcite .",
    "the matrices appearing here will always be of a special tridiagonal form , namely @xmath49 and such matrices will be referred to as two - diagonal .",
    "the following two propositions were obtained in  ( * ? ? ? * appendix ) :    [ prop1 ] let @xmath40 , and suppose that @xmath43 and @xmath44 or @xmath45 .",
    "consider two @xmath50 matrices @xmath51 and @xmath0 , defined as follows .",
    "@xmath51 has elements ( @xmath52 ) : @xmath53 @xmath0 is the two - diagonal @xmath50-matrix of the form   with @xmath54 then @xmath51 is orthogonal , and the columns of @xmath51 are the eigenvectors of @xmath0 , i.e.  @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues of @xmath0 : @xmath57    in short , the pair of polynomials @xmath58 and @xmath59 form a `` racah double '' , and the relation @xmath60 governs the corresponding recurrence relations with @xmath0 taking the role of a jacobi matrix  @xcite .",
    "[ prop2 ] let @xmath40 , and suppose that @xmath43 and @xmath44 or @xmath61 .",
    "consider two @xmath62 matrices @xmath51 and @xmath0 , defined as follows .",
    "@xmath63 @xmath0 is the two - diagonal @xmath62-matrix of the form   with @xmath64 then @xmath51 is orthogonal , and the columns of @xmath51 are the eigenvectors of @xmath0 , i.e.  @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues of @xmath0 : @xmath65    the special case considered in this paper is for @xmath66 .",
    "the reason for this will be clear in the following , but at this point one can already observe that for these values the eigenvalues of @xmath56 ( both in even dimensions , , as in odd dimensions , ) take a simple form .",
    "for these special values , the matrix elements of @xmath0 in the case of proposition  [ prop1 ] become : @xmath67",
    "we see that in this case the expressions for coefficients with even and odd indices coincide and can be written as a single expression , namely @xmath68 with @xmath69 .",
    "suppose we are in the case @xmath44 , i.e.  @xmath70",
    ". it will be useful to rewrite @xmath71 , with @xmath72 , and then the matrix elements take the form @xmath73    also in the case of proposition  [ prop2 ] the matrix elements of @xmath0 simplify for the special values @xmath66 .",
    "they can also be written as a single expression , and after writing @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) they read : @xmath74    taking into account the size of the matrices in both cases , the results from proposition  [ prop1 ] and proposition  [ prop2 ] can be unified in the following :    [ propr1 ] for @xmath75 a positive integer , @xmath76 and a parameter @xmath72 , let @xmath77 the eigenvalues of the tridiagonal @xmath78-matrix of the form   are given by the integers @xmath79 which are equidistant , symmetric around zero , and range from @xmath80 to @xmath75 .",
    "hence for even @xmath81 , they are @xmath82 consecutive even integers , while for odd @xmath83 they are @xmath82 consecutive odd integers .",
    "+ for @xmath81 even , the eigenvectors of @xmath0 are the columns of the matrix @xmath51 given by  , with @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "+ for @xmath83 odd , the eigenvectors of @xmath0 are the columns of the matrix @xmath51 given by  , again with @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .    note in particular that the eigenvalues of @xmath0 are independent of the value of the parameter @xmath88 , but of course @xmath88 appears in the expressions of the eigenvectors .",
    "we now consider a one - dimensional quantum oscillator model based on the findings of the previous section .",
    "particularly interesting about this model is that it contains a parameter @xmath72 . by construction , the spectrum of the position operator in this model will be independent of the parameter @xmath88 , equidistant and coincide with the spectrum of the @xmath1 finite oscillator model  @xcite .",
    "let us first return to the @xmath1 model , briefly introduced in section  1 . working in a representation @xmath16 of dimension @xmath5",
    "( where @xmath6 is integer or half - integer ) , and in the standard basis @xmath22 in which @xmath21 is diagonal , it follows from   that the hamiltonian is a diagonal matrix , @xmath89 in this context , it is more common to rewrite the basis vectors @xmath22 ( @xmath90 ) of this representation space as @xmath91 ( @xmath18 )",
    ". thus we can write @xmath92 also from  , the matrix form of the position operator @xmath9 in this basis is given by @xmath93 and the momentum operator @xmath10 takes the form @xmath94 clearly , these operators ( and matrix representations ) satisfy the hamilton - lie equations from   ( but not the canonical commutation relation ) .",
    "let us now turn to a new finite oscillator model based on the racah polynomials introduced in the previous section .",
    "for this purpose , observe that for any dimension @xmath95 , there is a close relationship between the matrix elements of @xmath0 , given by  , and those of the above matrix  : @xmath96 indeed , the positive parameter @xmath88 appearing in @xmath97 can be seen as a `` deformation '' of the element @xmath98 . and clearly , in the limit @xmath99 one has that @xmath100 . following this ,",
    "the elements of the new finite oscillator model  in any dimension @xmath5 ( @xmath6 integer or half - integer )  are defined as follows : the hamiltonian @xmath8 is the same operator as in   or  ; the operators @xmath9 and @xmath10 are @xmath101 with @xmath97 given by   or equivalently  .    for this new model ,",
    "the hamiltonian - lie equations are satisfied .",
    "so let us turn our attention to the properties of the position operator @xmath9 ( the properties of the momentum operator @xmath10 are completely similar and will not be given explicitly ) .",
    "following proposition  [ propr1 ] , the spectrum of @xmath102 is simply given by @xmath103 quite surprisingly , this spectrum is independent of the parameter @xmath88 appearing in the matrix elements   of @xmath9 ; but of course this is a consequence of proposition  [ propr1 ] , and in particular of the special choice of @xmath104 and @xmath105 earlier on in section  2 .",
    "so the spectrum of @xmath9 in the new model is just the same as in the familiar @xmath1 model . for the eigenvectors of @xmath9 , however , things are different , as follows from the last part of proposition  [ propr1 ] .",
    "the orthonormal eigenvector of the position operator @xmath9 for the eigenvalue @xmath106 , denoted by @xmath107 , is given in terms of the eigenstate basis of @xmath8 by @xmath108 herein , @xmath109 is the @xmath110 matrix with elements defined in terms of normalized racah polynomials   as in the previous section .",
    "explicitly , for @xmath6 a half - integer , the elements of @xmath51 follow from proposition  [ prop1 ] , with @xmath111 and @xmath112 : @xmath113 for @xmath6 an integer , they follow from proposition  [ prop2 ] , with @xmath114 : @xmath115    these expressions deserve further attention . remember that , just as in   for the @xmath1 model , quite generally the position ( resp .",
    "momentum ) wavefunctions are the overlaps between the normalized eigenstates of the position operator @xmath9 ( resp .  the momentum operator @xmath10 ) and the eigenstates of the hamiltonian .",
    "let us denote the position wavefunctions for the new oscillator model by @xmath116 , in order to emphasize the dependence upon the positive parameter  @xmath88 .",
    "we can thus write : @xmath117 where @xmath18 and @xmath118 .",
    "so @xmath119 is the `` ground state '' , @xmath120 the first excited state , and so on .",
    "all these expressions are real , and since we are dealing with a finite oscillator model they satisfy a discrete orthogonality relation : @xmath121    let us examine the explicit form of these functions in more detail , for the case @xmath6 half - integer ( the case @xmath6 integer is similar , and will not be treated explicitly ) .",
    "the expressions follow essentially from  .",
    "the even wavefunctions are given by @xmath122 where @xmath123 is written in terms of the weight function and square norm   of the racah polynomials .",
    "note that @xmath124 is indeed an even function of the position @xmath106 , and depends on @xmath125 only .",
    "+ the odd wavefunctions are given by @xmath126 clearly , because of the factor @xmath106 , @xmath127 is an odd function of @xmath106 .",
    "the overall factor in  , by the way , arises from @xmath128    it is interesting to study these discrete wavefunctions for varying values of @xmath88 .",
    "we know already that in the limit @xmath99 the position operator @xmath129 tends to the position operator of the @xmath1 model , so also the wavefunctions should have this behavior .",
    "when @xmath88 tends to infinity , the wavefunctions @xmath130 are indeed krawtchouk functions .",
    "clearly , the @xmath131 series in   and   reduce to @xmath132 series , which in turn reduce to @xmath133 series according to @xmath134 these reductions have been given in  @xcite and can be obtained , e.g. , from  ( * ? ? ? * ( 48 ) ) .",
    "the @xmath133 series in the right hand side correspond to symmetric krawtchouk polynomials ( i.e.  krawtchouk polynomials with @xmath135  @xcite ) .",
    "when @xmath6 tends to infinity , they yield the ordinary oscillator wavefunctions  @xcite .    for other values of @xmath88 ,",
    "let us examine some plots of the discrete wavefunctions . in figure  1 , we give the plots of @xmath130 for @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 , and for some fixed @xmath6-value @xmath139 .",
    "the purpose is to observe the behavior of the wavefunctions as the positive parameter @xmath88 varies . with this in mind , we have plotted these functions for the following @xmath88-values : @xmath140 for large values of @xmath88 , the discrete wavefunctions take indeed the shape of those of the @xmath1 model ( which , in turn , tend to the canonical oscillator wavefunctions when @xmath6 tends to infinity ) .",
    "the case @xmath141 is ruled out , but we have examined a @xmath88-value close to 0 , for which the behavior is somewhat ` degenerate ' . to our surprise , the value @xmath142 is a kind of transition value for the ground state . just looking at the ground state ( @xmath136 ) , one observes that for @xmath143 the shape is like a cup , whereas for @xmath144 it is like a cap . in order to explain this transition value , recall from   that @xmath145 using  , @xmath146 and thus for @xmath142 one finds @xmath147 .",
    "in other words , for this special transition value @xmath142 , the ground state wavefunction @xmath148 is a constant function .",
    "to conclude , in the field of finite quantum oscillators the original @xmath1 model remains an interesting model because of two reasons : the simple equidistant spectrum of the position ( and momentum ) operator , and the behavior of the position wavefunctions ( which really look like discrete versions of the canonical oscillator wavefunctions , and tend to them when @xmath6 is sufficiently large ) .",
    "the new model introduced in this paper deforms the @xmath1 model by a parameter @xmath72 .",
    "the spectrum of the position ( and momentum ) operator is the same and thus remains simple and equidistant .",
    "the wavefunctions are deformed by the parameter @xmath88 , and tend to those of the @xmath1 model when @xmath88 goes to infinity .",
    "the wavefunctions themselves are written in terms of racah polynomials , and originate from a racah double  @xcite .",
    "the shape of the wavefunctions could open applications beyond those of the @xmath1 model .",
