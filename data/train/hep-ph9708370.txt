    "exclusive electromagnetic form factors are a source of information about the internal structure of hadrons .",
    "the coupling of an elementary particle to the photon is determined by only a few dimensionless parameters , for example its total charge and magnetic moment . for a composite particle , however",
    ", these constant coefficients are replaced by momentum - dependent functions , the form factors , which reflect the distribution of charge and current , and hence the internal structure of the particle .",
    "a familiar analysis in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics relates the electromagnetic form factor directly to the fourier transform of the the charge density .",
    "relativistic behavior also depends very much on the nature of the hadronic state .",
    "high momentum transfer suggests high resolution , so hard elastic scattering is a natural way to study the detailed internal structure of hadrons .",
    "experiments in elastic electron - proton scattering showed long ago the famous dipole behavior of the nucleon electromagnetic form factors in terms of momentum transfer @xmath0 , @xmath1 , with @xmath2  .",
    "since then , many subsequent experiments studied this and related reactions .",
    "their influence on our understanding of the strong interactions themselves , however , has been somewhat overshadowed by that of the high energy _",
    "inclusive _ reactions .",
    "the discovery of approximate scaling in deeply inelastic scattering , and its explanation in terms of the parton model , opened a more direct and efficient avenue to study the quarks themselves , since inclusive rates decay much more slowly with momentum transfer .",
    "nevertheless , form factors at large momentum transfer remain an important window to quark binding in hadrons .    in this review",
    ", we will concentrate on electromagnetic form factors and resonance production amplitudes , at large momentum transfer , in the light of perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "qcd itself has enjoyed so many successes , and explains so many and varied experimental results , that it is universally recognized as  the \" theory of the strong interactions . yet ,",
    "the single most basic fact of the theory , the binding and confinement of the elementary degrees of freedom , the quarks and gluons , into hadrons , is still not described in detail .",
    "because of the property of asymptotic freedom at short distances , perturbative methods must be relevant in some degree to elastic scattering at large momentum transfer .",
    "because the binding of hadrons is a long - distance effect , nonperturbative effects must play a crucial role as well .",
    "the description of electromagnetic form factors requires the consistent analysis of both length scales in a single process .",
    "this , and the light that will be shed on hadronic structure by a truly successful treatment of this problem makes the study of form factors attractive . we note that electromagnetic form factors are part of the large class of exclusive hadronic amplitudes , which also describe , for example , both proton - proton elastic scattering and the exclusive decays of heavy mesons .",
    "although many of the methods developed below have wide applications in this larger class , we decided to restrict our discussion to form factors , in the hope of improving its focus .    in the remainder of this section",
    ", we discuss what we can learn from reasoning based on the parton model . here , and in most of the following , we assume _ very _ high momentum transfer , so high that parton masses may for the most part be neglected .",
    "we use parton model insights to identify quark counting rules , and as an inspiration for _ factorization _ of long- and short - distance effects in exclusive processes in terms of wave functions . in this section , we give primarily intuitive arguments , and concentrate for simplicity on the pion . in sec .",
    "[ ffiqcd ] , we discuss some of the central results of the qcd treatment of form factors , including the evolution of wave functions , the behavior of the asymptotic pion form factor , and qcd sum rules for moments of wave functions .",
    "these topics are somewhat more mathematical , but we have attempted to motivate technical arguments with physical intuition .",
    "we close this section with a brief summary of results relevant to baryons , especially helicity conservation , the derivation of form factors directly from qcd sum rules , and a few phenomenological models for moderate-@xmath3 behavior .",
    "we go on to review the central experimental results for pion , nucleon and resonance production form factors , to assess the successes and failures of qcd treatments of elastic scattering , and to explain the controversies that have enlivened this active field of inquiry . to anticipate , we will see that the current state of the data is not adequate to resolve the primary theoretical controversies .",
    "* 1.2.1 partons . *",
    "the perturbative treatment of hard exclusive processes assumes a partonic description of the participating hadrons .",
    "the general discussion is closely related to the parton model of _ inclusive _ processes , such as deep - inelastic scattering .",
    "the celebrated premise of the parton model , justified and systematically extended in qcd , is that _ inclusive _ processes are determined by the distributions @xmath4 , which are the probabilities for pointlike , constituent partons @xmath5 to carry fraction @xmath6 of the momentum of hadron @xmath7 , summed over all other partonic degrees of freedom .",
    "an _ exclusive _ form factor , on the other hand , reflects the coherent scattering of a hadron by an electroweak current . even at large momentum transfer",
    ", it may depend on states of definite partonic content .",
    "in fact , at high enough energies , exclusive amplitudes are dominated by hadronic states with  valence \" quark content , @xmath8 for mesons and qqq for baryons .",
    "this is despite the fact that , in its own rest frame , each hadron is a complicated , ever - shifting superposition of partonic states .",
    "let us discuss first how such a partonic picture of hard exclusive scattering emerges .    at sufficiently high momentum transfers in either hadron - lepton or hadron - hadron scattering ,",
    "the _ relative _ velocities of all participating particles are nearly lightlike . under this condition ,",
    "the quantum processes that bind the constituents of a hadron are highly time - dilated in the rest frames of the remaining particles , both incoming and outgoing .",
    "correspondingly , time dilation lengthens the lifetime of these states , and  freezes \" the partonic content of this hadron as  seen \" by the other particles . also , as relative velocities approach the speed of light , the time during which the hadrons remain in contact , and during which momentum can be transferred , decreases .",
    "in fact , we can always find a frame in which any pair of particles are in contact for a time that decreases like @xmath9 . under these conditions ,",
    "we expect a lack of quantum interference between long - distance , hadronic binding and short - distance momentum transfer .",
    "this _ incoherence _ between soft and hard physics implies that we may consider each hadron to consist of a definite partonic state during the entire collision process .",
    "this picture is illustrated for electron - pion scattering in fig .",
    "[ epi]a , in which long - time dynamics , described by a distribution of valence quarks @xmath10 , produces a  valence \" quark - antiquark state .",

    "the partons of this state in turn exchange momentum with an electron in a short - distance process @xmath12 . at a later time , they reform a pion , through wave function @xmath13 .        * 1.2.2 factorization . *",
    "we summarize the above considerations for an arbitrary exclusive amplitude @xmath14 by a schematic expression in which short - distance momentum transfer is factorized from the long - distance hadronic binding , @xmath15 here , the labels @xmath5 and @xmath16 refer to hadrons in the incoming and outgoing states , respectively .",
    "@xmath17 is the wave function that describes the amplitude for a pion to be found in partonic state @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is a perturbative function that describes the hard scattering between the partons ( and leptons ) .",

    "has two fundamental properties .",
    "first , the nonperturbative wave functions are universal within a class of exclusive amplitudes .",
    "this connects otherwise disparate processes , such as the pion electromagnetic form factor and pion - pion elastic scattering .",
    "second , the factorization of long- from short - distance dynamics implies consistency conditions that enable us to compute the amplitude s dependence on the momentum transfer .",
    "these are usually referred to as  evolution \" equations , examples of which we shall discuss below .",
    "the details of the convolution @xmath20 , and the derivations of evolution equations , depend on the process in question , but one example will suffice to motivate eq .",

    "( [ otimesfact ] ) in principle include sums over states with arbitrary numbers of partons .",
    "as indicated above , however , at very large momentum transfer , the valence state , with the fewest partons , dominates",
    ". we shall refer below to its contribution as  valence perturbative qcd \" ( _ valence pqcd _ ) .",
    "this is a somewhat unconventional usage ; indeed , what we call _ valence pqcd _ is more commonly referred to simply as  pqcd \" .",
    "but this approximation does not exhaust the use of perturbative methods in form factors at large momentum transfer , and to call it simply  pqcd \" is a little misleading .",
    "there are , of course , many contributions from states with more than the valence partons . for the most part",
    ", they are expected to decay rapidly with increasing momentum transfer , relative to the valence states .",
    "there is an exception , however , corresponding to states in which one parton carries nearly all of the hadron s momentum , while all other partons are soft .",
    "it is plausible that such a state could contribute to elastic scattering , because all of its partons except for one have long wavelengths .",
    "they may then overlap strongly with wave functions moving in any direction .",
    "when the single , hard parton scatters elastically , the soft partons from an incoming hadron may combine with the outgoing hard parton to form an outgoing hadron .",
    "this is illustrated for the pion electromagnetic form factor in fig .",
    "it is known as the  soft \" or ",
    "feynman \" mechanism for elastic scattering .",
    "nevertheless , the feynman mechanism contains a hard scattering , which may , in principle , be factored from the interactions of soft partons , and treated with the methods of pqcd .",
    "for instance , in @xcite it was analyzed for pion and nucleon form factors .",
    "this pqcd investigation , unfortunately , has not yet been developed extensively in the literature , and although it seems clear that the soft mechanism does not contribute at asymptotically high momentum transfer , at what scale it becomes negligible is not well understood .",
    "we shall come back to the role of the soft mechanism often below , however , because its contribution may be studied directly in the valence state , using sudakov resummation , and in qcd sum rules , and , indirectly , in models of nonperturbative hadronic structure .",

    "this will have important consequences below .",
    "similarly , the off - shellness , and the transverse momenta of the pair in fig .  [ formfact ] are boost - invariant , and we take these quantities to be fixed , and negligible compared to both @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",

    "eventually , the pair will fill out the full spatial extent of the pion , which is again lorentz contracted .",
    "to form the pion , however , their momenta must be parallel , and each must carry a positive fraction of @xmath29 , as shown .",
    "an alternative picture relies on the  infinite momentum frame \" ( imf ) , in which all participating particles move in the same direction , with energies @xmath41 . in this frame , all momentum transfers are transverse .",
    "its main attraction lies in the conjecture that quantization formulated in an imf simplifies the treatment of confinement in qcd .    in the process depicted in fig .",
    "[ formfact ] , the quark undergoes a momentum transfer @xmath42 , and the antiquark @xmath43 , with @xmath6 ( @xmath44 ) the fractional momentum of the quark in the incoming ( outgoing ) pion .",
    "this must take place during the time that the wave functions of the incoming and outgoing pions overlap , that is , on a time scale that vanishes as @xmath45 .",
    "the uncertainty principle requires that both members of the pair must be localized within @xmath45 of each other and of the action of the current , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ formfact]a .",
    "this restriction shows , first of all , that not all details of the valence state wave function are relevant to exclusive scattering .",
    "we do not need the full two - particle state ; we only need the probability for the members of the pair to be within a transverse distance of @xmath45 of each other .",
    "we shall _ assume _ that this probability is simply a function of @xmath6 times the geometrical factor @xmath46 .",
    "this  scaling \" of the wave function in @xmath6 is not exact in qcd ; we will compute corrections to it when we discuss evolution below in sec .",

    "thus , we have @xmath47 so that @xmath48 results of this sort , based on incoherence , scaling and geometrical estimates , are known as  quark counting \"",

    "as seen , much work remains in both experiment and theory .",
    "valence pqcd and factorization appear to be an attractive starting point for treating high form factors , although how high  must be for valence pqcd to dominate remains controvertial , and most probably depends on the specific reaction .",
    "opinions on this matter vary strongly , from those who maintain that the required  is much higher than is likely to be experimentally accessible in the forseeable future , to those who believe that valence pqcd is already applicable at  as low as a few .",
    "we suggest that the quality and extent of existing data does not allow a definitive conclusion , but that soft non - perturbative processes probably play an important role for much of the existing data . on the other hand ,",
    "given the complexity of qcd , there is a need for further theoretical work , based on fundamental principles of qcd , to deal with the soft , or feynman mechanism .",
    "indeed , it may be possible to express form factors in the transition region as a sum over valence pqcd and feynman mechanism contributions , with the hard - scattering imbedded in the latter treated with pqcd methods . for the truly soft region , lattice calculations may play an increasing role in the future .    on the experimental side",
    ", one must push the frontiers to as high  as technically feasible , to provide data which has the best chance of testing these ideas .",
    "one should also go beyond the experiments which merely test constituent scaling , to those which test other central tenets of theory , such as helicity conservation .",
    "such work has now begun at cebaf , and may be further extended by a proposed european facility , elfe in summary , this area appears to offer some of the most interesting theoretical and experimental challanges for the next decade .",
