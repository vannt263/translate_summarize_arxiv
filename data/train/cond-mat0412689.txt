    "this tendency of cholesteric liquid crystals ( clc ) to form helical twisting patterns is caused by the presence of anisotropic molecules with no mirror plane    so - called chiral molecules ( see  @xcite for a recent review ) .",

    "@xmath11 then defines the equilibrium configuration in an unbounded clc .",
    "periodicity of the spiral is given by the half - pitch , @xmath12 , because @xmath13 and @xmath14 are equivalent in liquid crystals ,    typically , the pitch @xmath15 can vary from hundreds of nanometers to many microns or more , depending on the system .",
    "the macroscopic chiral parameter , @xmath16 , ( and thus the pitch ) is determined by microscopic intermolecular torques  @xcite and depends on the molecular chirality of clc consistuent mesogens .",
    "the microscopic calculations of the chiral parameter are complicated as it is necessary to go beyond the mean - field approach and to take into account biaxial correlations  @xcite . despite recent progress  @xcite",
    ", this problem has not been resolved completely yet .    in this paper",
    "we are primarily concerned with orientational structures in planar clc cells bounded by two parallel substrates .",
    "director configurations in such cells are strongly affected by the anchoring conditions at the boundary surfaces which break the translational symmetry along the twisting axis .",
    "so , in general , the helical form of the director field will be distorted .    nevertheless ,",
    "when the anchoring conditions are planar and out - of - plane deviations of the director are suppressed , it might be expected that the configurations still have the form of the ideal helical structure .",
    "but , by contrast with the case of unbounded clcs , the helix twist wavenumber @xmath0 will now differ from @xmath1 .",
    "it has long been known that a mismatch between the equilibrium pitch @xmath15 and the twist imposed by the boundary conditions may produce two metastable twisting states that are degenerate in energy and can be switched either way by applying an electric field  @xcite .",
    "this bistability underlines the mode of operation of bistable liquid crystal devices    the so - called bistable twisted nematics    that have been attracted considerable attention over past few decades  @xcite .",
    "more generally the metastable twisting states in clc cells appear as a result of interplay between the bulk and the surface contributions to the free energy giving rise to multiple local minima of the energy .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore the multiple minima and their consequences .",
    "the free twisting number @xmath1 and the anchoring energy are among the factors that govern the properties of the multiple minima representing metastable states .",
    "specifically , varying @xmath1 will change the twist wavenumber of the twisting state , @xmath0 .",
    "this may result in sharp transitions between different branches of metastable states .",
    "the dependence of the twist wavenumber @xmath0 on the free twisting number @xmath1 is then discontinuous . as far as we are aware , attention",
    "was first drawn to this phenomenon by reshetnyak  _ et .",
    "al _  @xcite .",
    "these discontinuities are accompanied by a variety of physical manifestations which have been the subject of much recent important research .",
    "one such is a jump - like functional dependence of selective light transmission spectra on temperature as a result of a temperature - dependent cholesteric pitch , examined by zink and belyakov  @xcite .",
    "more recently belyakov  _ et .",
    "@xcite and palto  @xcite have discussed different mechanisms behind temperature variations of the pitch in clc cells and hysteresis phenomena .    in this paper",
    "we adapt a systematic approach and study the helical structures using stability analysis .",
    "this approach enables us to go beyond the previous work by relaxing a number of constraints .",
    "one of these requires anchoring to be sufficiently weak ( where `` sufficiently '' will be discussed further below ) , so that the jumps may occur only due to transitions between the helical configurations which numbers of spiral half - turns differ by the unity  @xcite .",
    "noticeably , this assumption eliminates important class of the transitions that involve topologically equivalent structures with the half - turn numbers of the same parity .",
    "we shall also apply our theory to the case of non - identical confining plate and show that asymmetry in the anchoring properties of the bounding surfaces results in qualitatively new effects . specifically",
    ", we find that sufficiently large asymmetry in anchoring strengths will suppress the jump - like behaviour of the twist wavenumber @xmath0 when the free wavenumber @xmath1 varies .",
