    "in scientific computations , expectations with respect to probabilities , induced by continuous time processes , are often replaced by monte carlo averages over independent trajectories . for diffusions , generated by",
    "stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) , the trajectories are usually approximated numerically ( see e.g. @xcite ) . the accuracy assessment of such numerical procedures is a well studied topic and the available theory establishes and quantifies the convergence of the approximations to the actual solution in a variety of modes , depending on the properties of the sde coefficients .",
    "this in turn typically suffices to claim convergence of expectations for path functionals , continuous in an appropriate topology , but unfortunately , may not apply to discontinuous functionals , some of which arise naturally in applications .",
    "one important example of such a functional is the hitting time of a domain boundary",
    ". let @xmath0 be the diffusion process on @xmath1 , generated by the it sde @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the brownian motion and the coefficients @xmath4 and @xmath5 are functions , assumed to satisfy the regularity conditions , guaranteeing existence of the unique strong solution ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the hitting time of the level @xmath6 is @xmath7 where @xmath8 .",
    "thus @xmath9 is an extended random variable with values in the polish space @xmath10 , endowed with the metric @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "consider a family of continuous processes @xmath13 , generated by a numerical scheme with the time step parameter @xmath14 ( such as e.g. the euler - maruyama recursion and below ) and suppose that @xmath15 approximates the diffusion @xmath16 in the sense of weak convergence .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath17 be the space of real valued continuous functions on @xmath18 , endowed with the metric @xmath19 then @xmath15 converges weakly to @xmath16 , if for any bounded and continuous functional @xmath20 @xmath21 such convergence can often be established using the techniques , developed in e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in particular , if @xmath22 is a functional , almost surely continuous with respect to the measure induced by @xmath16 , then implies @xmath23 for any continuous and bounded function @xmath24 . in other words ,",
    "the weak convergence of the processes @xmath25 implies the weak convergence of the random variables @xmath26 or , equivalently , the convergence of the probability distribution functions @xmath27 for any @xmath28 , at which the distribution function @xmath29 is continuous .",
    "let us now take a closer look at the hitting time @xmath30 viewed as a functional on @xmath17 . clearly @xmath31 is discontinuous at some paths : for example , if @xmath32 and @xmath33 , then @xmath34 as @xmath35 , but @xmath36 and @xmath37 for all @xmath38 .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath31 is continuous at any @xmath39 , which either upcrosses @xmath40 : @xmath41 or downcrosses @xmath40 : @xmath42    if this type of paths is typical for the diffusion , i.e. if the set of all such paths is of full measure , induced by the process @xmath16 , then @xmath31 is essentially continuous and the weak convergence @xmath25 still implies the weak convergence @xmath43 . however , if @xmath40 is an accessible absorbing boundary of @xmath16 , the paths which hit @xmath40 can not leave it at any further time . for such diffusions",
    "@xmath31 is discontinuous on a set of positive probability and the weak convergence @xmath43 can not be directly deduced from @xmath25 .",
    "hitting times play an important role in applied sciences , such as physics or finance , and since their exact probability distribution can not be found in a closed form beyond special cases , practical approximations are of considerable interest .",
    "there are two principle approaches to compute such approximations .",
    "one is based on the fact that the expectation of a given function of the hitting time solves the dirichlet boundary problem for an appropriate pde , and thus the approximations can be computed using the generic tools from the pde numerics .",
    "sometimes , the particular structure of the emerging pde can be exploited to calculate expectations of special functions of hitting times , such as moments ( as e.g. in the linear programming approach of @xcite ) .",
    "the probabilistic alternative is to use the monte carlo simulations , in which the diffusion paths are approximated by numerical solvers .",
    "typically the diffusions are simulated on a discrete grid of points and the evaluation of the hitting times requires construction of the continuous paths through an interpolation .",
    "the naive approach is to use the general purpose interpolation techniques , such as the one used in our paper ( see below ) .",
    "better results are obtained if the possibility of having a hit between the grid points is taken into account as in e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the convergence analysis of the approximations of the hitting times , based on the various numerical schemes , appeared in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the results obtained in these works , assume ellipticity or hypoellipticity of the diffusion processes under consideration , which corresponds to the case of non - absorbing boundary in the preceding discussion .",
    "the analysis beyond these non - degeneracy conditions appears to be a much harder problem .    in this paper",
    "we consider a particular diffusion on @xmath44 , with an absorbing boundary at @xmath45 .",
    "as explained above , the absorption time in this case is a genuinely discontinuous functional of the diffusion paths , which makes the convergence analysis of the approximations a delicate matter .",
    "we propose a simple approximation procedure , based on the euler - maruyama scheme , and prove its weak consistency .    in the next section",
    "we formulate the precise setting of the problem and state the main result , whose prove is given in section [ sec-3 ] .",
    "the results of numerical simulations are gathered in section [ sec - num ] and some supplementary calculations are moved to the appendices .",
    "consider the diffusion process @xmath0 , generated by the it sde @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are constants and @xmath3 is the brownian motion , defined on a filtered probability space @xmath50 , satisfying the usual conditions .",
    "this sde has the unique strong solution ( proposition 1 in @xcite ) and is known in mathematical finance as the constant elasticity of variance ( cev ) model ( see e.g. @xcite ) . for @xmath51",
    ", it is also feller s branching diffusion , being the weak limit of the galton - watson branching processes under appropriate scaling .",
    "the process @xmath16 is a regular diffusion on @xmath52 and a standard calculation reveals that @xmath45 is an absorbing ( or feller s exit ) boundary ( see  6 , ch .",

    "continuous for @xmath68 ( see lemma [ lem1 ] below ) and hence @xmath70 as @xmath71 .",
    "this argument , however , does not apply to @xmath72 , since it is _ essentially _ discontinuous , as discussed in the introduction . leaving the question of convergence @xmath73 open",
    ", we shall prove the following result    [ thm ] for any @xmath74 , @xmath75    note that @xmath76 is a continuous functional for any fixed @xmath14 and hence can be seen as a mollified version of the discontinuous @xmath72 .",
    "the parameter @xmath77 controls the mollification , relatively to the step - size parameter of the euler - maruyama algorithm .    in practical terms ,",
    "the convergence provides theoretical justification for the procedure , in which the approximate trajectory @xmath15 , generated by and , is stopped not at @xmath78 , but at @xmath79 , which only approaches zero as @xmath71 .",
    "our method does not quantify the convergence in terms of e.g. rates , but the numerical experiments in section [ sec - num ] indicate that this stopping rule produces practically adequate results .",
    "as will become clear from the proof , our approach exploits the local behavior of the sde coefficients near the boundary and can be applied to the more general one - dimensional diffusions of the form , for which a weakly convergent numerical scheme is available .",
    "for example , all the arguments in the proof of theorem [ thm ] directly apply to the diffusion , whose coefficients @xmath80 and @xmath81 have a similar local asymptotic at @xmath78 as the cev model .",
    "the sde is a study case , which seems to capture the essential difficulties of the problem , related to the degeneracy of the sde coefficients on the absorbing boundary .",

    "<S> we consider the cev diffusion from the mathematical finance and show how a weakly consistent approximation for the absorption time can be constructed , using the euler - maruyama scheme . </S>"
