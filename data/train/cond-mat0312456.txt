    "recent remarkable experiments @xcite on the superfluid ( sf ) to mott insulator ( mi ) transition in a system of ultracold atoms in an optical lattice open intriguing prospects for studying many - body phenomena , associated with strongly correlated systems in a highly controllable environment .",
    "the optical lattices @xcite  arrays of microscopic potentials induced by the ac stark effect of interfering laser beams  provide ideal conditions for the study of the laser cooling and the quantum phase transitions of the confined cold atoms .",
    "the dynamics of the confined atoms in optical lattices is adequately described by the bose - hubbard model @xcite , which predicts sf - mi transition at low temperature with increasing the ratio of the on - site interaction to the hopping matrix element . besides many experimental efforts made to realize sf - mi transition ,",
    "a large number of theoretical studies have appeared @xcite . in reference",
    "@xcite an appropriate mean - field approximation was developed for the hamiltonian of spinless or polarized bosons in an optical lattice , and in order to describe the zero - temperature phase transition from the superfluid to the mott - insulating phase , the phase diagrams were calculated .    since optical traps @xcite liberate the spin degrees of freedom and make possible condensation of spinor bosons , extensive interests have been stimulated in the study of multi - component spinor bec .",
    "the quantum phase transition in spinor bec , as well as a variety of other novel phenomena @xcite were well studied .",
    "subsequently , inspired by these works , the theoretical researches about the sf - mi transition of the spinor bosons trapped in an optical lattice arise .",
    "most recently , demler and zhou @xcite have studied spin-1 bose atoms in an optical lattice and obtained several unique properties .",
    "et al_. @xcite , hou and ge @xcite have investigated the spin-1 and spin-2 bosons in an optical lattice with the mean - field approximation method and obtained the phase diagrams showing a transition from mott insulator to superfluid , respectively .    on the other hand , the response to external magnetic field of bec is also a topic with interests @xcite .",
    "the experimentalists have concentrated on investigating the systems in an applied magnetic field because the phase transition can be tuned by adjusting the magnetic field rather than changing the samples measured @xcite .",
    "thus the theoretical study in this aspect is necessary .",
    "so far , ueda and koashi @xcite have discussed the magnetic response of spin-1 and spin-2 bec in a mesoscopic regime ; as to the system in an optical lattice , svicainsky and chui @xcite have studied the spin-1 bosons in a magnetic field and shown some effects induced by the magnetic field . however , the spin-2 case in a magnetic field has not been discussed yet . what about the ground states , quantum phase transition and the influence of the magnetic field on this system ?",
    "this is our mission in the present letter .",
    "first , ignoring the hopping term of the hamiltonian , we get the site - independent hamiltonian , its energy eigenvalues and the mott ground states for different cases . then , applying mean - field approximation and regarding the hopping term as a perturbation , we perform the calculations in second - order and draw the phase diagrams .",

    "for example , there is only spin component with zeeman level @xmath126 when occupation number per site @xmath95 ; spin components with @xmath127 for mott state @xmath128 , and spin components with @xmath129 for @xmath130 . for the initial mott ground state including only one spin component , one superfluid component occurs when lowering the ratio @xmath51 , such as the case @xmath131 in fig .

    "we find that the influence of magnetic field on the phase diagrams is manifold , and the boundaries between sf and mi are essentially dependent on the magnetic properties of the ground states .",

    "they are the subject of future study .",
    "in addition , it is worth to note that phase diagrams of the zero magnetic field can not be derived by taking @xmath145 simply , since our derivation is based on the degeneracy lifting .    in conclusion",
