    "parity non - conservation ( pnc ) in atoms , described in the standard model of the electroweak interaction by exchange of @xmath3 bosons between bound electrons and nuclear quarks , leads to nonvanishing electric - dipole matrix elements between atomic states with the same parity .",
    "the nuclear spin - independent part of pnc matrix elements ( arising from the vector nucleon current ) is proportional to a conserved weak charge @xmath4 , which is sensitive to physics beyond the standard model .",
    "measurements of the @xmath5 pnc amplitude in @xmath1cs , following the procedure described by bouchiat and bouchiat @xcite , were carried out to 2% accuracy by gilbert and wieman @xcite and , more recently , to 0.3% accuracy by wood _",
    "et al . _",
    "following the recent measurements , there was a revival of interest in the associated atomic structure calculations of the pnc amplitude @xcite .",
    "indeed , bennett and wieman @xcite analyzed differences between experimental and theoretical values of amplitudes for allowed transitions , polarizabilities , and hyperfine constants in cs and concluded that the error in the atomic structure calculations of the pnc amplitude should be reduced from 1% , the value given in refs .",
    "@xcite , to 0.4% . using this revised estimate of the accuracy of the calculations",
    ", they showed that the experimental value of the weak charge of @xmath1cs differed from the standard - model value @xcite , @xmath6 by 2.3  @xmath7 .",
    "this difference between experiment and theory , being one of the two largest differences reported in the current review of particle physics @xcite , suggested the existence of a second neutral @xmath8 boson @xcite .",
    "implications of this difference for new physics were also reviewed in @xcite and discussed in @xcite .",
    "breit corrections to the pnc amplitude , which were ignored in @xcite and underestimated in @xcite , were shown to decrease the size of the calculated pnc amplitude by a 0.6% by derevianko @xcite ; this finding was confirmed in refs .",
    "including breit corrections reduces the difference with the standard model to 1.6  @xmath7 if the 0.4% error in the calculations determined in @xcite is assumed or to 0.9  @xmath7 if the more conservative 1% error given in refs .",
    "@xcite is assumed .",
    "radiative corrections to pnc matrix elements @xmath9 in the strong coulomb field of a highly - charged one - electron ion were considered recently by bednyakov _",
    "these corrections were decomposed into two parts , radiative corrections to the operator @xmath10 , and radiative corrections to wave functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the former corrections were evaluated for @xmath1cs in refs .",

    "( [ qw ] ) . the dominant part of the wave function radiative correction , which arises from the one - loop diagrams fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , was evaluated for @xmath13 matrix elements in highly - charged one - electron ions in ref .",
    "sushkov , in his analysis of the breit corrections @xcite , suggested that the residual radiative corrections to pnc amplitudes in many - electron atoms could be of the same order of magnitude as the breit corrections .",
    "we examine this suggestion further in the present paper and find that the one - loop wave - function radiative corrections increase the size of the pnc amplitude in @xmath1cs by 0.4% and , correspondingly , increases the difference between the theoretical and experimental weak charge .",
    "moreover , we find that the one - loop wave function correction is insensitive to electron - electron correlation effects .",
    "one - loop radiative corrections ( vacuum polarization corrections ) in an external coulomb field were considered by wichmann and kroll @xcite , who showed that these corrections simply modify the electron - nucleus coulomb interaction at short range .",
    "the modification of the coulomb interaction is described , to leading order in powers of @xmath14 , by the uehling potential:@xcite @xmath15 we use atomic units here ; @xmath16 is the fine structure constant and @xmath17 is the speed of light .    in applications to atomic pnc",

    "a comparison of the present results with those from @xcite are given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "uehling corrections to @xmath28 and @xmath29 levels of cs ( the levels of primary interest in pnc calculations in cs ) are about twice as large as finite nuclear size corrections and have opposite signs as shown in the table for levels with @xmath30=1 and 2 .",
    "we carry out two calculations of the @xmath0 pnc amplitude in the modified potential , both leading to precisely the same relative correction to the pnc amplitude .",
    "the first of these calculations , is done at the `` weak '' dirac - hartree - fock ( dhf ) level of approximation .",
    "the perturbation @xmath31 to a valence electron wave function @xmath32 induced by the _",

    "the perturbed dhf equations are solved to give the @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the pnc amplitude is then given by the sum of two terms : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the dipole operator .",
    "this calculation leads to a value of the pnc amplitude that is 20% lower than the final correlated value found in refs .",

    "the second calculation is done at the `` weak '' random - phase approximation ( rpa ) level of approximation , in which the class of correlation corrections associated with weak perturbations of the core orbitals are included in the calculation .",
    "this calculation leads to a value of the pnc amplitude that is 3% larger than the final correlated value of the amplitude given in @xcite .",

    "again , the one - loop correction is seen to increase the size of each of the two terms and their sum by 0.41% .    from the two calculations above",
    ", it is apparent that the short range vacuum - polarization corrections are independent of electron - electron correlation .",
    "the situation is similar to that found for the short range nuclear `` skin '' correction arising from the difference between the neutron and proton radius of the nucleus @xcite , which also leads to a correlation - independent correction to the pnc amplitude .",
    "one - loop radiative corrections to the electron wave functions from vacuum - polarization in the nuclear field are evaluated .",
    "the resulting wave functions are used to calculate the pnc amplitude for the @xmath0 pnc transition in @xmath1cs , leading to a 0.4% increase the size of the amplitude .",
    "this correction is found to be correlation independent .",
    "an average of the three most accurate calculations@xcite , of the @xmath0 amplitude , taking account of breit corrections and one - loop radiative corrections gives @xmath45 were we use the estimate from @xcite for the error in the calculations . combining this calculated amplitude with the experimental value of the amplitude from @xcite leads to an experimental weak charge @xmath46 this value differs by 2.2  @xmath7 from the standard model .",
    "if we assume a 1% error in the theoretical amplitude , then the theoretical component of the error in @xmath47 is increased to @xmath48 and the difference with the standard model becomes 1.2  @xmath7 .",
    "we have considered only the dominant one - loop wave - function radiative corrections in the above calculation and ignored the higher - order @xmath49 corrections to the uehling potential discussed by wichmann and kroll @xcite .",
    "the wichmann - kroll corrections can be easily estimated and are expected to have a negligible effect on the present result .",
    "moreover , the `` vertex '' radiative correction to the pnc amplitude , which contributes about 0.1% to the standard model value of @xmath4 , is evaluated in refs .",
    "@xcite using free - particle propagators .",
    "this radiative correction should be redone using coulomb - field propagators .",
    "if coulomb - field effects were to change the vertex correction by 100% ( probably a gross overestimate ) the standard model value of @xmath4 would change by only 0.1% .",
    "we therefore expect that further changes to the value of @xmath4 from the strong - field corrections to the operator @xmath10 discussed in @xcite will be smaller than 0.1% .",
