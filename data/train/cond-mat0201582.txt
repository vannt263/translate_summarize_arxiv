    "relaxor ferroelectrics @xcite have been attracting considerable attention in recent years due to their unusual physical behavior . lead magnesium niobate , pbmg@xmath4nb@xmath5o@xmath3 ( pmn ) , is probably the best investigated perovskite relaxor crystal .",
    "many of novel models which try to describe the physical properties of pmn are grounded on the assumption of the existence of a 1:1 mg / nb ordered microregions at least in 1/3 of the volume of a crystal . on the other hand ,",
    "the latest x - ray and neutron diffraction measurements performed on the pbsc@xmath2nb@xmath2o@xmath16 ( psn ) with different degree of cation ordering show that ferroelectric phase transition undergoes in both ordered ( 1:1 sc / nb ) and completely disordered samples @xcite .",
    "it might mean that long - range ordering can not be suppressed completely by compositional ( chemical ) disorder .",
    "moreover , a large shifts of all type of ions from cubic regular positions in pmn as well as in psn already at t @xmath6 t@xmath7 ( t@xmath7 represents the temperature of dielectric constant maximum ) were obtained from the computer treatment of the x - ray and neutron diffraction peaks . due to this , the phase transition even in psn becomes incomprehensible because , as it follows from x - ray data , at t @xmath6 t@xmath7 , for instance , pb@xmath17 ions are shifted away of about 0.027 nm with equal probability along one of the directions @xmath12 , @xmath13 or @xmath14 .",
    "this consideration left unclear , however , if these ion shifts are the static or dynamical ones .",
    "another difficulty in the interpretation of the x - ray and neutron diffraction data in relaxors is related to amorphous character of observed diffraction peaks even at t @xmath18 t@xmath7 .",
    "these methods provide an averaged view of the structure resulting in the cubic ( pmn ) or close to cubic symmetry ( psn ) .",
    "broadening of diffraction peaks is caused by the compositional disorder of these materials .",
    "thus , local methods of magnetic resonance and , in particular , nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) can be extremely useful in the study of such disordered systems because in nmr experiment the nuclei are sensitive to their environment only at a distance less then 1 - 2 nm .",
    "it provides also possibility to distinguish between the static and dynamic ion shifts that is practically unattainable in x - ray diffraction methods .    in our previous papers ( see , for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite ) we have already studied @xmath0nb and @xmath1sc nmr spectra both in the pmn and psn . in particular , it was shown that at t @xmath19 t@xmath7 nmr spectra of @xmath0nb are mainly determined by the electric - field - gradient contribution originated from disorder in nb / mg(sc ) lattice sites . from nmr",
    "spectra analysis evidences were obtained about the existence of ordered and disordered microregions in both materials .",
    "unfortunately , earlier measurements were carried out mainly at a low larmor frequency ( @xmath20 49 mhz ) so a bigger part of the @xmath0nb spectrum belonging even to 1/2 @xmath21 -1/2 transition remained invisible and could not be analysed .",
    "more detailed @xmath0nb and @xmath1sc nmr spectra were recently presented in ref.@xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , only the temperature dependence of the second moment of the narrow subset of nmr lines has been analysed .",
    "a broad background observed in the spectrum was attributed to unresolved satellite transitions and it was not analysed .    the purpose of the present paper is to study local structure both of pmn and psn at temperatures t @xmath6 t@xmath22 on the base of @xmath0nb and @xmath1sc nmr measurements performed at larmor frequency @xmath23 93 mhz .",
    "we believe that complete 1/2 @xmath8 -1/2 transition spectrum can be observed in such conditions . because one of studied materials ( psn ) belongs to a 1:1 system , where the 1:1 sc / nb order really exists it should be thus interesting to see what are the common features and what are the differences in nmr spectra of these two types of relaxors",
    ".    description of the nmr line shape was performed on the base of analytical formulas , allowing for both homogenious and inhomogenious mechanisms of line broadening . as a second method of nmr spectra analysis we used numerical monte carlo simulation , which allowed to take into account random distribution of mg , nb and sc ions ( shifted away or not ) over b - type sites of ab@xmath24b@xmath25o@xmath3 perovskite lattice .",
    "the structural data obtained are compared with analogous data resulting from x - ray diffraction methods .",
    "finally , the problem of 1:1 mg / nb ordered microregions in pmn is discussed as well .",
    "the measurements were carried out on single - crystal samples of pmn and psn grown on a seed crystal from solution in melt .",
    "samples had a good optical quality .",
    "the sample dimensions of psn were ( 4x4x4 ) mm@xmath26 , and pmn - up to ( 8x8x8 ) mm@xmath26 with the surfaces parallel to crystallographic ( 001 ) planes .",
    "the nmr measurements were performed in a 9.2 t superconducting magnet at @xmath27sc larmor frequency @xmath28 = 92.3 mhz ( i = 7/2 ) and @xmath0nb @xmath29 = 92.9 mhz ( i = 9/2 ) .",
    "temperature was stabilized in a continuous - flow cryostat with an accuracy of about 0.1 k. the inhomogeneously broadened spectra of @xmath0nb and @xmath1sc ( 1/2 @xmath8 -1/2 transition ) have been obtained using the fourie transform of the spin echo after a 90@xmath30 - @xmath31 - 90@xmath32 - @xmath31 - acquisition pulse sequence .",
    "the width of the 90@xmath33 pulse was 2.1 @xmath34 and 2.4 @xmath34 for @xmath0nb and @xmath1sc resonances , respectively .",
    "a time delay @xmath31 was usually 40 @xmath35 for both of nuclei .",
    "measurements were performed at t = 400 - 450 k because we were interested mainly in the local structure of pmn and psn in high temperature phase , i. e. , at t @xmath6 t@xmath7 ( t@xmath36 355 k and 310 k for psn and pmn , respectively ) . as an example in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we presented @xmath1sc nmr spectra measured for three characteristic crystal orientations in the external magnetic field : b ii [ 001 ] , [ 011 ] and [ 111 ] .",
    "the characteristic feature of the spectrum for b ii [ 001 ] and [ 111 ] is its strong asymmetry while for b ii [ 011 ] the spectrum is almost symmetric .",
    "similar spectra of @xmath37nb in the psn and pmn are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] , respectively .",
    "let us discuss first the sc and nb spectra in the psn .",
    "both the sc and nb spectra have approximately similar structure and both contain a narrow component of the width of ( 3 - 4 ) khz and a wide component that is different for the sc and nb nuclei . the narrow part of spectra is well described by a gaussian and is completely isotropic . on the contrary ,",
    "the wide part is essentially anisotropic and can not be precisely described by a simple function . in rough approximation , however , it can be also described by a gaussian ( see in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in such approach",
    "the ratio of integral intensity of narrow and wide parts of the spectrum is approximately equal ( 40:60 ) and does not depend on the crystal orientation .",
    "note that due to large width of the @xmath0nb spectrum its wide component has very small intensity and thus its anisotropy manifests itself much less than that in the @xmath1sc spectrum .",
    "however measurement of whole the @xmath0nb spectrum in psn , using the sweep of the irradiation frequency , indeed showed that the nb spectrum shape is very close to that for @xmath1sc ( insert to fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "@xmath0nb spectrum in pmn is somewhat complicated . in this spectrum",
    "we can conditionally separate three components : ( 1 ) low - intensity isotropic line with the width of 3 khz ; ( 2 ) spectrum around @xmath28 with the width of 15 - 18 khz ; ( 3 ) wide and strong anisotropic component like that in psn but more intensive . the narrow part with @xmath38 = 3 khz accounts only for about 1.5 - 2 percent of the total integral intensity of the spectrum . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , beside the narrowest component the whole spectrum is strongly anisotropic .",
    "the anisotropy of spectra as well as asymmetric form with respect to @xmath39 for both of @xmath0nb and @xmath1sc nuclei and in both the pmn and psn points out that given spectra belong to 1/2 @xmath8 -1/2 transition the frequency of which is shifted by the second order quadrupolar contributions @xcite .",
    "this quadrupole contribution exists only for nuclei with spin i @xmath6 1/2 and is related to the interaction of the nuclear quadrupole moment with the electric field gradient ( efg ) .",
    "large values of quadrupole moments of @xmath0nb and @xmath1sc niclei ( @xmath40 m@xmath41 and @xmath42 m@xmath41 for @xmath0nb and @xmath43sc , respectively ) usually result in predominance of the quadrupole contribution to nmr frequency shift with respect to other possible sources , as chemical shift and magnetic dipole - dipole interaction . therefore we can draw conclusion that main features of @xmath0nb and @xmath1sc nmr spectra in both the pmn and psn are related to characteristic features of their efg , that depend on a lattice ions charges and their positions , i.e. local structure of crystals .",
    "the integral intensity ratio ( 40:60 ) obtained above for the narrow and wide parts of the @xmath1sc and @xmath0nb nmr spectra in psn is in agreement with the sc / nb degree of ordering which varied in the studed crystals in the range of 30 - 40 percent .",
    "so , it can be assumed that narrow and wide parts of the spectra belong to the sc and nb nuclei situated in the ordered 1:1 and disordered regions of the crystal , respectively .",
    "actually , in the ordered regions sc and nb ions are surrounded by a symmetrical ion configuration .",
    "therefore in such sites the electric - field - gradients and anisotropic chemical shift must be close to zero and we can expect a nmr line broadened only by the magnetic dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "calculation of this dipole - dipole width gives the value of about 3 khz supporting the origin ( ordered 1:1 regions ) of narrow lines in @xmath1sc and @xmath0nb nmr spectra .",
    "evidently , the wide part of nmr spectra belongs to resonances from nuclei located in the disordered regions of the crystal , where random distribution of nonequal charges b@xmath44/b@xmath45 ions produce electric - field - gradients .",
    "it follows from recent x - ray and neutron diffraction data @xcite that in these regions the lead and oxygen ions may be shifted away from their regular cubic positions of about 0.01 to 0.035 nm , which gives an additional contribution to the efg tensor components . of course , due to disorder in the ions positions we can expect broad distribution in values of the efg tensor components which manifestes in inhomogeneous broadening of nmr lines .",
    "the resonance frequency shift related to quadrupole mechanism for the considered case of @xmath46 1/2 transition is proportional to the squared efg .",
    "it can be written as follows    @xmath47    where @xmath48    the function @xmath49 in eq.([eq1 ] ) describes the dependence of frequency shift on mutual orientations of external magnetic field and efg tensor principal axes , @xmath50 is the larmor frequency , x , y , z form the pricipal efg tensor reference frame .",
    "angular variation of the wide part of nmr spectra can be qualitatively understood if to assume presence of an axial efg pointed at @xmath51001@xmath6 cubic directions . in this case",
    "angular part of expression ( [ eq1 ] ) takes a simple form :    @xmath52    expected resonances for all six @xmath51001@xmath6 directions of the efg tensor are depicted as hystograms in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in this our simple interpretation",
    "we have to take into account that due to large disorder in the ions positions efg values become randomly distributed that leads to strong inhomogeneous broadening of nmr lines . as a result , only the shift of the center of gravity is visible in the experimental spectrum under crystal rotation . obviously , that because of nonlinear relation between resonance frequency shift and quadrupole frequancy inhomogeneously broadened nmr line acquires essentially asymmetrical form , which besides depends on orientation of a crystal in external magnetic field .",
    "for such complex spectrum its decomposition on simple gaussian components and the analysis of their angular dependence can not give true values of quadrupole frequencies .",
    "in what follows , we introduce the distribution of largest efg component which leads to the distribution of quadrupole frequencies @xmath53 .",
    "let us suppose that this distribution function can be expressed in gaussian form , i. e.    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the mean value of the quadrupole frequency and @xmath56 is the width of its distribution .",
    "allowing for the nonlinear relation between @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( see eq.([eq1 ] ) ) , namely    @xmath59    the shape of inhomogeneously broadened line can be written as ( ref .",
    "@xcite )    @xmath60    substitution of eq.([eq3 ] ) into eq.([eq5 ] ) gives    @xmath61    to take into account the additional homogeneous broadening mechanism with gaussian lineshape ( dipole - dipole interactions ) one has to make the integration    @xmath62 d\\nu ^{\\prime } ,   \\label{eq7}\\ ] ]    where @xmath63 being a half of the gaussian width .",
    "one can see that eqs .",
    "( [ eq6]-[eq7 ] ) give an asymmetrical lineshape which depends also on the parameter @xmath64 that takes into account the mutual orientations of efg and magnetic field b@xmath22 .",
    "one can expect that in disordered materials there are microregions with different @xmath45degree of order@xmath45 and different directions ( and mean values ) of the ion displacements .",
    "obviously , in such a case the nmr line should be the composition of the lines @xmath65stemming@xmath45 from these microregions , i.e. @xmath66    where subscript @xmath45i@xmath45 numerates the microregions .",
    "the results of simulation on the base of eqs.([eq6]-[eq8 ] ) of the @xmath67 nmr line shape for @xmath68 $ ] are presented by solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) and ( b ) . figure [ fig4](a ) shows the line shape for the case of efg with largest principal axis points in @xmath69 directions only .",
    "the contribution from ordered regions , where @xmath70 was included also .",
    "the best fit has been achieved for @xmath71 = 755 khz and @xmath56 = 210 khz .",
    "the contribution of homogeneous broadening was estimated as @xmath63 = 2 khz .",
    "one can see that calculated nmr line has a strongly asymmetrical shape , which fits very good the right @xmath45shoulder@xmath45 of the measured spectrum .",
    "the fitting of left @xmath45shoulder@xmath72 is not so good .",
    "this can be expected because for @xmath69 orientation of efg only a positive quadrupole shift of resonance frequency exists ( see eq.(4 ) when @xmath73 ) .",
    "therefore , to fit the left shoulder of the observed spectrum the other orientations of efg axes are required .",
    "the negative shift is possible for efg axes pointing along @xmath74 and @xmath75 directions .",
    "the reason for this type local distortions can be related to substitutional disorder in the relaxors .    really , the probability of configurations with @xmath76 ions of b@xmath77 type in the nearest neighbourhoods of b@xmath77 or b@xmath78 ions can be written as    @xmath79    one can see that @xmath80 for @xmath81 are close to each other , while the probability of having @xmath76 = 6 or 0 is much smaller than the most probable value @xmath82 = 0.328 corresponding to @xmath76 = 2 .",
    "it is easy to see that configurations with @xmath81 can be the response of the three afore - mentioned lattice distortions .    finally ,",
    "the experimental line shape of @xmath1sc was well fitted by the following theoretical curve @xmath83    with c@xmath84 ; the subscripts denote the direction of the efg axes .",
    "the result of @xmath1sc complete spectrum simulation is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) .",
    "the obtained set of fitting parameters ( @xmath53 and @xmath56 are presented in table [ table1 ] ) permits to describe theoretically the nmr line shapes measured for any other orientation of magnetic field . in particular in fig . [ fig4](c ) and ( d ) the observed and calculated line shapes for @xmath85 $ ] and @xmath86 $ ] are shown .",
    "one can see the good agreement between measured and calculated line shapes .",
    "similar simulations performed for @xmath0nb nmr spectra are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] and corresponding fitting parameters are listed in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the agreement between measured and calculated spectra seems also good , however , due to small intensity of the wide part of the spectrum obtained parameters may contain significantly bigger miscalculation than that for the @xmath1sc spectrum .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] that practically all the @xmath0nb spectrum in pmn is strongly broadened in comparison with the dipole - dipole width that is equal to 2.8 - 3.6 khz ( as in the case of psn ) .",
    "the portion of the spectrum unbroadened by quadrupole mechanism or by anisotropic chemical shift accounts only for 1 - 2 percent of the total intensity .",
    "it is clear that the nb nuclei , which give the contribution into this narrow spectrum , locate at the positions close to the regular cubic ones .",
    "possible origin of these crystal regions will be discussed in the next section .",
    "the wide , main part of the @xmath0nb spectrum is related to the disordered , locally noncubic , regions of the crystal , as in the case of psn .",
    "contrary to psn , the portion of such regions in pmn accounts for 98@xmath87 of the total volume of the crystal .",
    "@xmath0nb spectrum for disordered pmn was fitted assuming local distortions along @xmath51001@xmath6 , @xmath51110@xmath6 or @xmath51111@xmath6 directions , i.e. as in the case of the psn by eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) . because the procedure of the simulation is completely similar to that described for psn we confined here only presentation in table [ table1 ] of spectral parameters derived .",
    "compareing spectral data for disordered psn and pmn one can emphesize a similarity in the symmetry and sometimes even in the values of electric field gradients at nb positions .",
    "one can see also that dispertion in pmn is larger than in psn .",
    "this is in agreement with the fact that in pmn local lattice distortions should be much larger due to bigger difference in the ionic charges of b@xmath44 and b@xmath45 cations .    summarizing",
    ", three main conclusions should be made .",
    "\\(i ) in the ordered regions , which account up to 30@xmath87 in the psn and 2 - 3@xmath87 in the pmn of the total crystal volume , lattice ions occupy cubic lattice positions where electric field gradients are close to zero .",
    "\\(ii ) in the disordered regions there are non - zero efg along pure cubic directions ( @xmath51001@xmath6 , @xmath51110@xmath6 or @xmath51111@xmath6 ) . because both the psn and pmn has in average cubic symmetry at t @xmath6 t@xmath7 , these non - zero efg can be related to randomly distributed unequal charges of b - type cations and/or random shifts of the ions from their positions in the cubic lattice . in this case",
    "the essential part of ions ( @xmath88 30 - 55@xmath87 ) experiences shift along @xmath89001@xmath6 axes .",
    "\\(iii ) efg tensor components are significantly distributed around their mean values that manifests in broad asymetric nmr line shape .      in the previous section on the basis of analytical calculation of the shape of inhomogeneously broadened nmr line the mean values of quadrupole coupling constants in sc and nb cation positions as well as their dispertions were obtained .",
    "the method applied by us has allowed to take into account only distribution of the quadrupole frequencies ( @xmath53 ) , but the presence of random deviations of efg axes from their most probable directions , i.e the possible fluctuations of @xmath90 ( see eq . ( [ eq1 ] ) ) remained discounted .",
    "note that this effect is mainly related to a distant ion contributions .",
    "ignoring of these fluctuations has resulted in too much high values of homogeneous width , which was accordingly 4 khz and 8 khz for the @xmath1sc and @xmath0nb in psn and 18 khz for the @xmath0nb in pmn .",
    "let@xmath91s remind , that dipole width for both the @xmath1sc and @xmath0nb accounts only 2.8 - 3.2 khz .",
    "the second reason on which we have undertaken numerical calculation of efg is related to attempt to define ions displacements , which could be responsible for symmetry and magnitude of an efg in both relaxor systems .",
    "taking into account complexity and substantially uncertainty of local structure of these compaunds we used the simple model of point charge point dipole , which , however , took into account effects related to partial covalency of bonds in the bo@xmath92 octahedron as well as electronic polarizibility of ions .",
    "obviously due to limitations of the point charge model the obtained ions shifts should be considered only as an estimated ones , the degree of which reliability depends on correctness ( luck ) of a choice of such empirical parameters of ions as their effective charges and polarizibility .    in the point charge point",
    "dipole approximation the electric field gradient components at the site of the nucleus are given by    @xmath93 ,   \\label{eq11}\\ ] ]    where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the electric point chages and dipole moment on the k - th ion .",
    "@xmath96 is the distance between the k - th ion and the observation point , and @xmath97 is the anti - shielding parameter @xcite    for the conviencity three contributions into efg were detached in the whole sum ( [ eq11 ] ) .",
    "the first contribution ( @xmath98 ) was related to random distribution of charges of b@xmath44/b@xmath45 ions at lattice points of ideal abo@xmath3 perovskite structure .",
    "contributions of ions at a distance up to five lattice constants ( 2 nm ) were summed up .",
    "however , usually the distance up to 1.2 - 1.5 nm was sufficient due to the rapid decay of v@xmath99 with the distance ( see eq . [ eq11 ] ) .",
    "in the calculations the b type ions were randomly distributed at lattice sites with the help of random number generator or they were located in the 1:1 or 1:2 ordered regions .",
    "the main condition for any ion configuration was electroneutrality , i. e. the stoichiometric ( in average 1:1 for psn and 1:2 for pmn ) composition in the calculated region was conserved .",
    "as an example , the result of the calculation of largest component @xmath100 as a function of polar angle @xmath101 for the pmn is presented in fig .",
    "here we took effective valence charges of mg@xmath17 and nb@xmath10 as one haft of their formal charges .",
    "it is seen that @xmath100 lies close or along cubic directions , but it is strongly distributed in both the magnitude and orientation .",
    "the mean value @xmath102 v / cm@xmath41 ( @xmath104 ) is much less than that expected from coupling constant measured .",
    "thus , this contribution to the efg can not be responsible for wide component of the @xmath0nb nmr line .",
    "it can give only some contribution to homogenious broadening of nmr line because it leads to distribution of axes directions of the total efg .",
    "note that in pbsc@xmath2nb@xmath2o@xmath3 this part of efg is neglectly small in comparison even with the dipole - dipole width , that is in good agreement with smaller difference between charges of sc@xmath9 and nb@xmath10 and , in addition , 1:1 type relaxors have more symmetrical distribution of b@xmath105/b@xmath45 ions .",
    "the second contribution ( v@xmath106 ) into efg took account for the shifts of b@xmath44/b@xmath45 ions themselves relatively to the nearest six oxygen ions .",
    "possible shifts of pb@xmath17 ions were not taken into account due to their smaller ( 10 - 15 times ) contribution into efg for the same values of the shifts .    in a general case for arbitrary b type ion shift with respect to the center of the undistorted oxygen octahedron ,",
    "the following expressions for efg tensor components were obtained :    @xmath107    where ( d@xmath30 , d@xmath32 , d@xmath108 ) are vector components of the nb or sc shift , @xmath109 is the effective valence charge of the oxygen , @xmath110 ( @xmath111 is the lattice constant ) . for the simplisity",
    "the @xmath112 was taken as an avarage value over all six oxygen ions .",
    "its value may lay in the range between @xmath113 ( batio@xmath114 @xcite ) and @xmath115 ( knbo@xmath116 @xcite ) .",
    "the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq11 ] ) is related to the induced electric dipole moments @xmath117 .",
    "assuming that only electronic polarization of the nearest six oxygens gives marked contribution to the efg ( the other ions in the unit cell and the next nearest oxygens give contributions that are an order of magnitude smaller ) , the dipole contibution is :    @xmath118    where @xmath119 is assumed to be in the direction of the @xmath120 axis of the field gradient .",
    "in the case of @xmath51110@xmath6 and @xmath51111@xmath6 symmetry of lattice distortions nondiagonal components of the efg tensor have to be also appeared .",
    "they are given by expression    @xmath121    electronic dipole moment dependes on ionic polarizability and value and direction of ions shifts and it can be usually calculated using knowledge of the polarization and internal electric field . obviously for disordered relaxors such a way is not suitable because here is only local polarization and large uncertainty in the ions positions .",
    "therefore , for the estimation of @xmath122 we applied a method of effective dipole moments .",
    "in particular , it is known , that in perovskite ferroelectrics the spontaneous polarization can be well described by the born effective charges :    @xmath123    where @xmath124 is the cell volume , and the born effective charges @xmath125 are 0.82(k ) , 9.13(nb ) , -6.58(o@xmath126 ) , -1.68(o@xmath127 ) in tetragonal phase of knbo@xmath3 @xcite and 3.87(pb ) , 7.07(ti ) , -5.71(o@xmath126 ) , -2.51(o@xmath128 ) in pbtio@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the high values @xmath129 indicate on larger contribution of electronic dipole part to whole polarization in the comparison with rigid ionic part , that should be as a rule in high polarizable perovskite ferroelectrics @xcite .    taking into account a special role of pb ions , namely their strong hybridization with oxygen ions",
    ", we used in our calculations the effective charges derived in pbtio@xmath3 .",
    "for simplisity the same avaraged value of @xmath130 was taken for evaluation of the electronic dipole moment @xmath131 in expressions ( [ eq13]-[eq14 ] ) .",
    "one can easy see , that under these conditions expressions ( [ eq12 ] ) and ( [ eq13]-[eq14 ] ) become similar , thus in the calculation of the whole dipole contribution to the efg one can use only its electronic part , because @xmath132 .",
    "note that similar results were obtained in knbo@xmath3@xcite and batio@xmath3@xcite .",
    "taking into account that the ion shifts can have random values due to the disorder of the mg , nb and sc positions , the ion shift distribution function was assumed in the gaussian form :    @xmath133    where @xmath134 is mean value of the shift and @xmath135 is its dispersion .",
    "complete nmr line shape was calculated taking into account electric - field - gradient contribution , magnetic dipole - dipole interaction , as well as chemical shift mechanisms . since the contribution of the last mechanism was much less with respect to the quadrupole one it manifests itself only in the central narrow part of the spectrum .",

    "the antishielding parameter is rather uncertain .",
    "however , clearly its value has to be smaller of about two times in comparison with @xmath0nb due to smaller number of electronic orbitals .",

    "the results of calculation in pmn for two crystal - orientations ( b ii [ 001 ] and [ 011 ] ) are presented in fig .",
    "the individual contributions which were related to the nb shifts in different directions with respect to oxygen positions are presented as well .",
    "the values of ion shifts and their dispersion obtained by fitting of the experimental nmr spectra are listed in the table [ table3 ] .",
    "excellent similarity of ion shifts in pmn and disordered psn is obtained . on the other hand , a large relative dispersion of niobium ( or rather oxygen ) shift",
    "is noted along @xmath51111@xmath6 and @xmath51011@xmath6 directions .",
    "such a large fluctuations in ion shifts can show their dynamic character .",
    "actually , we can not expect full motional narrowing of nmr spectrum , since the frequency shift of the -1/2 @xmath8 1/2 transition depends on the square of efg .",
    "however , this assumption can be supported by measuring and analysis of nmr spectra changes with decreasing temperature .",
    "we plan to carry out such analysis in the nearest future . on the other hand , large dispersion of the quantities",
    "is characteristic feature of relaxors .",
    "three main comments should be made .",
    "\\(i ) the values presented in table [ table2]-[table3 ] are the relative shifts between nb(sc ) and oxygen ions , i. e. , @xmath143 .",
    "larger contribution into @xmath143 values due to oxygen ions shift rather than that of nb(sc ) ions is expected in accordance with x - ray data @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) the real values of ion shifts can be somewhat different from those given in the tables [ table2]-[table3 ] due to simplifications allowed in the calculations , including point charges model",
    ". however the conclusion about existence of the displacements , their directions and dispersion is not related to the model of efg calculation because it follows directly from observed shape and width of @xmath1sc and @xmath0nb nmr lines .",
    "\\(iii ) in the ordered regions the sc@xmath9 , nb@xmath10and o@xmath11 ions occupy completely cubic lattice positions , i. e. they are not shifted . on the contrary , in the disordered regions these all ions are randomly shifted away from their cubic lattice sites in one of the directions : @xmath51001@xmath6 , @xmath51011@xmath6or @xmath51111@xmath6 . the larger part of ions ( @xmath8850@xmath87 ) experiences shift along @xmath51001@xmath6axes",
    "evidently , basic question in the understanding of the origin of unusual physical properties of relaxor ferroelectrics is their local structure , because at any temperature and even on a micrometric scale the average symmetry is cubic rather than any lower one ( see , for instance , @xcite and references therein ) . note , that the existence of diffusive scattering in the powder neutron diffraction patterns observed in pmn below 340 k was interpreted in ref .",
    "@xcite as the occurrence of local polar order inside the average paraelectric matrix . however , it is still a matter of debate whether this polar order is organized as small ferroelectric domains or as a dipole glass .",
    "in contrast to pmn , psn  at t @xmath51 t@xmath144 ( t@xmath144 @xmath145 350 - 360 k ) undergoes into the @xmath146 rhombohedral ferroelectric phase @xcite .",
    "moreover , this crystal can be easily obtained in 1:1 sc / nb ordered state .",
    "it is important to emphasise that the polar long range order appears not only in perfect 1:1 sc / nb ordered psn , but even in compositionally disordered crystal @xcite , i. e. the compositional disorder does not prevent establishing at least partly of a long - range order . to our mind this may correspond to mixed ferro - glass phase .",
    "it is important to compare psn and pmn local structure on the base of nmr data because many of novel models , which explain the behaviour of pmn at low temperatures , are based on the existence of 1:1 mg / nb ordered micro - regions similar to 1:1 sc / nb regions in psn .",
    "it is clearly seen from figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] that for 1:1 ordered regions in the psn distinctive narrow line in both @xmath1sc and @xmath0nb nmr spectra are obtained . in these regions",
    "sc and nb ions are located in regular cubic lattice sites , where the total electric - field - gradient is zero or close to zero .",
    "the @xmath0nb nmr spectrum in pmn also exhibits narrow component ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) but its integral intensity is only of about 1.5 - 2 percent of the total spectrum intensity ( tables [ table2],[table3 ] ) .",
    "evidently , it is reason to ascribe this @xmath0nb resonance to the regular 1:2 mg / nb ordered regions of the crystal .",
    "note that this resonance could not belong to 1:1 mg / nb ordered regions because in agreement with high resolution electron microscopy study @xcite the portion of such ordered regions ( if they exists ) should be approximately 30@xmath87 .",
    "thus , if local ( @xmath88 1.5 - 2.5 nm ) 1:1 ordered clusters exist in pmn , the disagreement between nmr and electron microscopy data can be overcame in supposition that in these local regions niobium and oxygen ions are shifted as in completely disordered regions .",
    "this fact seems to be strange .",
    "let us remind that in 1:1 sc / nb ordered psn the sc and nb ions are situated in correct cubic lattice sites .",
    "taking into account this argument , the model grounded on the alternation of nb and ( mg@xmath5nb@xmath4 ) layers which also explains the observation of 1/2 @xmath51111@xmath6 superlattice diffraction peak @xcite seems to be more convincing . in this",
    "model local strains induced by the charge disbalance between the nb and mg / nb layers can be locally compensated by oxygen ion displacements which will give the contribution in the electric field gradient .",
    "additional contribution to efg is also due to ( mg@xmath5nb@xmath4 ) layer compositional disorder .",
    "obtained evidence about three possible directions of nb ions shift relatively the surrounding ions ( so that oxygen and lead ions shift can contribute also ) seems to be very important .",
    "physical nature of this phenomenon can be related to substitutional disorder in the relaxors a(b@xmath147b@xmath148)o@xmath114 .",
    "we can not exclude also that ion shift in one out of three observed directions may be the result of ferroelectric phase transition which could be at burns temperature t@xmath149 = 640 k @xcite .",
    "however with the temperature decrease strong random fields completely destroy this ferroelectric long range order because of correlation radius @xmath150 decrease at t @xmath51 t@xmath149 ( here @xmath150 is the correlation radius of the lattice that should be responsible for the phase transition at t@xmath149)@xcite . as a result",
    "only a small movable polar clusters appear below t@xmath149 .",
    "in such a picture strong dispersion and v - f law , observed in the temperature dependence of dielectric permitivity in pmn ( see , e.g. @xcite and ref . therein ) can be considered as manifestation of reentrant phase ( like that in magnetic systems @xcite ) of aforementioned burns reference phase .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that proposed methods of nmr line shape analysis can be applied to other disordered materials where the nmr frequency shift is a nonlinear function of the random electric field gradients ."
