    "the high energy gamma ray background radiation ( gbr ) was first discovered 36 years ago with the sas-2 satellite@xmath0 and was later studied in detail with the compton gamma ray observatory@xmath1 ( cgro ) and more recently with the fermi gamma ray satellite@xmath2 .",
    "recently , also a high energy neutrino background radiation ( nbr ) was discovered with the megaton icecube detector@xmath3 deep under the ice of the south pole .",
    "high energy particle physics offers three common production mechanisms of both the gbr and nbr .",
    "they include production of mesons in hadronic collisions of cosmic rays ( crs ) with ambient matter in the galactic interstellar medium@xmath4 ( ism ) and in the intergalactic medium@xmath5 ( igm ) whose decays produce photons , electrons and neutrinos , photo production of mesons in cr collisions with radiation in / near gamma ray source@xmath6 , and decay of massive dark matter particle relics from the big bang@xmath7 .",
    "but , so far , no connection has been found@xmath8 between the nbr and gbr . and",
    "the origin and observed properties are still unsolved cosmic puzzles .",
    "here we show that the very high energy nbr discovered@xmath0 with icecube is that expected from the gbr observed with fermi - lat at much lower energies@xmath2 , if both were produced by hadronic collisions of cosmic rays accelerated in relativistic jets with matter inside these jets , which are launched mostly in supernovae explosions of type ic that produce the long duration gamma ray bursts@xmath9 ( grbs ) , and by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "the highly relativistic jets launched in core collapse sn explosions of type ic that produce long duration grbs and by agn also accelerate through the fermi mechanism@xmath10 the swept in ionized matter in front of them@xmath9 to cosmic ray energies with a power - law spectrum@xmath10 @xmath11 .",
    "these cosmic rays escape the jets by diffusion in the turbulent magnetic fields inside the jets . for a kolmogorov spectrum@xmath12 of the random magnetic fields in the jets ,",
    "the crs diffusion coefficient is proportional to @xmath13 and consequently the residence time of the crs in the jets is @xmath14 .",
    "hadronic collisions of these high energy crs in the jets produce mesons ( mainly @xmath15 s and @xmath16 s ) , which decay shortly after to the stable particles : photons ( @xmath17 ) , electrons ( @xmath18 ) and neutrinos ( @xmath19 of the three known flavors @xmath20 ) . the decay @xmath21 with energy per photon @xmath22 67.5 mev in the @xmath23 rest - frame dominates @xmath17-ray production .",
    "neutrino production is dominated by the cascade decay of @xmath24 , where @xmath25 stands for electron neutrino in @xmath26 decay and electron antineutrino in @xmath27 decay , and where the @xmath18 and the three neutrinos have each an energy @xmath28 35 mev in the @xmath29 rest frame .",
    "when a high energy cr proton of energy @xmath30 produces a @xmath15 with a lab frame energy @xmath31 , lorentz invariance implies that the average lab frame energy of the 2 @xmath17 s from @xmath23 decay is @xmath32 whereas that of the @xmath33 is @xmath34 .",
    "high energy collisions satisfies approximately feynman scaling@xmath35 , namely , the @xmath36-distribution of the produced mesons does not depend on @xmath37 since the cr residence time in the jets is proportional to @xmath38 , the spectra of the produced high energy mesons , photons and neutrinos become @xmath39 .",
    "inelastic pp collisions produce roughly equal numbers of @xmath23 s , @xmath26 s and @xmath27 s with the same @xmath36-distribution , and neutrino oscillations convert the produced neutrino flux into three equal fluxes of neutrinos of the three neutrino flavors .",
    "thus , the produced @xmath17-ray flux and neutrino flux per flavor due to cr production of @xmath15 mesons satisfy the simple relation @xmath40^{1.33}\\phi_\\gamma=0.42\\ , \\phi_\\gamma.\\ ] ] eq .",
    "( 1 ) is valid for the injected spectrum of @xmath17-rays and neutrinos when meson production in hadronic collisions of the high energy cosmic rays takes place inside the highly relativistic jets launched by the main cosmic accelerators ( supernovae , pulsars , compact binaries , microquasars , and blazars ) .",
    "however , the observed spectrum of the gbr is modified by absorption of extragalactic high energy @xmath17-rays in @xmath41 collisions with the photons of the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) .",
    "moreover , the egb has been observed below 820 gev , while the nbr has been detected in the 35 tev - 3 pev energy range ( where the background of atmospheric neutrinos becomes negligible ) .",
    "consequently , eq .  ( 1 ) can not be tested directly because the nbr and egb were measured in different energy ranges .",
    "above 100 gev the flux of the extra galactic photons is progressively absorbed by the ebl@xmath42 .",
    "this attenuation of the egb , however , becomes small at@xmath43 @xmath44 gev and the unattenuated egb can be extrapolated from there to the 35 tev- 3 pev energy range where it can be compared to the nbr that has been measured@xmath3 with icecube .",
    "the lack of a precise knowledge of the ebl@xmath45 does not allow a precise theoretical evaluation of the attenuation of the egb .",
    "but , presumably , the observed attenuated egb can be parametrized as a power - law that represents the unattenuated egb with an exponential cutoff , which represents the attenuation . indeed , the egb that was measured during 50 months@xmath2 with the fermi large area telescope ( fermi - lat ) is very well fit ( @xmath46 ) by @xmath47^{-0.30}\\ , { \\bf e^{-{e\\over   0.366{\\rm tev}}}}\\,{{\\rm gev\\over cm^2\\ , sr\\,s}},\\ ] ] as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the attenuation of the egb decreases its contribution to the gbr flux at @xmath48 gev by @xmath49 . adding this loss to the mean flux of the gbr observed with fermi - lat@xmath3 at 100 gev yields unattenuated sky averaged gbr flux , @xmath50    the contribution of bremsstrahlung and inverse compton scattering of background photons by cosmic ray electrons and cosmic ray production of of @xmath23 in the ism decreases rapidly with energy .",
    "hence , if the unattenuated gbr at e@xmath51 gev is dominated by hadronic meson production , then the @xmath52 production ratio yields a @xmath53 flux per flavor @xmath54^{-0.30 }              { { \\rm gev\\over cm^2\\ , sr\\ , s } } .\\ ] ] the power - law index is harder than 1/3 probably because of the increase with energy of the total inelastic pp cross section .",
    "about @xmath55 of the flux is extragalactic in origin and @xmath56 galactic in origin .",
    "moreover , the sky distribution of the gbr and nbr are expected to be nearly identical . both , the magnitude and the spectral index of this predicted flux agrees with the best fitted single power - law , @xmath57^{-0.30}\\ ,             { \\rm gev\\ , cm^{-2}\\ , s^{-1}\\ , sr^{-1}}$ ] reported@xmath3 recently by the icecube collaboration .",
    "however , since @xmath58 and the flux of cr nucleons has a knee around @xmath59 pev , where its power - law index changes@xmath60 from @xmath61 -2.7 to @xmath62 , the spectral index of the nbr is predicted to change around 150 tev from -2.3 to -2.6 , @xmath63^{-0.60 }             { { \\rm gev\\over cm^2\\ , sr\\ , s } } , \\ ] ] for e@xmath64 tev , as shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the striking consistency between the gbr and nbr ( in magnitude and spectral index ) shown in fig 2 . is obtained neither for meson photo production in / near source nor for decay of massive relic particles from the big - bang ( see supplementary material ) .",
    "among the cosmic accelerators that have been identified through their non - thermal radio , x - ray and @xmath17-ray emissions , only the highly relativistic jets that produce the long duration gamma ray bursts in supernova explosions of type ic and the jets of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) appear to be able to accelerate cosmic ray nuclei to their highest observed energies with their observed spectra , composition and fluxes .",
    "the jets have a mean column density sufficiently large for efficient hadronic production of mesons by the crs accelerated inside the jets .    upon launch , the highly relativistic jets emitted by sn type ic explosions and by agn are optically thick@xmath65 , mainly due to compton scattering .",
    "their expansion makes them transparent to radiation when their column density decreases below @xmath66 .",
    "the swept in ionized particles in front of them are fermi accelerated by their turbulent magnetic fields and escape by diffusion in through these fields@xmath65 . during their diffusion in the jets , ,",
    "the crs suffer inelastic collisions with a probability @xmath67 , where @xmath68 for e@xmath69 tev and @xmath70 for e@xmath71 tev .",
    "they produce a broken power - law flux of secondary neutrinos and gamma - rays , with a spectrum @xmath72 , with a probability that exceeds by far the probability of being produced in the ism of the host galaxy .",
    "an estimate of the grb contribution to the enb , from such a source that is based on the very successful cannonball model of grbs is@xmath65 , @xmath73 ^ 2}\\,\\left[{e\\over m_p}\\right]^{-1/3}\\,.\\ ] ] in this estimate , @xmath74 is the observed rate of grbs , @xmath75 is the number of grbs todate with known redshift @xmath76 , luminosity distance @xmath77 and isotropic equivalent gamma ray energy @xmath78 and the summation extends over such grbs where @xmath79 is the probability that a cr proton that was accelerated in a grb at redshift @xmath76 , produced a neutrino in hadronic collisions of the crs in the jet . using only priors and completely avoiding adjustable parameters , eq .",
    "( 6 ) yields a neutrino flux@xmath80 compatible ( within errors ) with our estimated galactic and extragalactic contributions to the nbr .",
    "the diffuse gamma ray background that has been measured below 820 gev with fermi - lat and the diffuse neutrino background that was discovered with icecube in the 35 tev - 3 pev energy range are consistent with being produced jointly in hadronic collisions of extragalactic cosmic rays in / near source .",
    "such a common source is very likely the highly relativistic launched in supernovae type ic , and by agn , most of which do not point in our direction .",
    "the emission from the jets may be spread over long time window and therefore may not be in conflict with the icecube limits on the neutrino fluxes from individual@xmath81 and stacked@xmath82 grbs , since they were derived from observations within rather a short time window covering the prompt emission and the early afterglow phases of grbs ( such a short time window is expected in the popular fireball models of grbs@xmath83 ) .",
    "the observed gamma ray and neutrino backgrounds are compatible with those predicted by the cannonball model of grbs@xmath83",
    ".    detailed calculations of cosmic ray production of gamma rays and neutrinos in hadronic collisions of galactic cosmic rays in the interstellar medium of our galaxy and external galaxies , yield only a small contribution to the observed gbr and nbr with a much steeper spectral decline@xmath80 .",
    "although the approximate isotropy , spectral index and flux level of the high energy neutrino background measured with icecube ( _ 4 _ ) are consistent with an extragalactic origin , a dominant contribution to the observed background from cosmic ray production of neutrinos in the milky way with nearly the same sky distribution as the gbr can not be ruled out at present by the icecube observations , because of low statistics and the large uncertainty in the neutrino arrival directions of most of the icecube events .    999    c. e. fichtel , g. a. simpson , and d. j. thompson , _ astrophys",
