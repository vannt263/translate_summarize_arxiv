    "an interesting laboratory for studying the structure of elementary particles is the electromagnetic form factor @xmath2 of the pion , as there are a lot of experimental data for this observable  @xcite . in the case of the @xmath3 kaon",
    ", there is much less knowledge about its electromagnetic form factor @xmath4 , but it is possible to find some experimental results for @xmath5}^2 $ ]  @xcite .",
    "further , the recent high - statistics brookhaven experiment e865  @xcite has provided us with more information on @xmath6 .",
    "the amplitude for the decay @xmath7 was measured for @xmath8 up to 0.125 [ gev / c]@xmath1 ( the maximum value for the kinematics of this kaon decay ) , that allows to obtain indirectly the value of @xmath4  @xcite .    the main objective of the light - front models used in this work is to describe consistently hadronic bound state systems for high and low @xmath9 regimes . in light - front models , the bound state wave function is defined on the hypersuperface @xmath10 and it is covariant under kinematical boosts , due to the stability of fock - state decomposition under such boosts  @xcite .    as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , problems related to the rotational symmetry breaking make the results of electromagnetic form - factor calculations in the light - front formalism dependent on which component of the electromagnetic current is used to obtain the form - factors .    at low momentum transfers , the non - perturbative regime of qcd is more important when compared with high momentum transfers dominated by the perturbative regime of qcd .",
    "perturbative qcd works well after @xmath11  [ gev / c]@xmath1 and dominates above @xmath12  [ gev / c]@xmath1 .",
    "the studies on light - flavor vector and scalar mesons are important because they indicate a direction to understand why qcd works in the non - perturbative regime and , also , why the pseudoscalar mesons are the observed light hadrons related with chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "as known for spin-1 particles  @xcite , the plus component  ( `` @xmath13 '' ) of the electromagnetic current is not free from pair term contributions in the breit frame ( @xmath14 ) , so the rotational symmetry is broken if they are dropped out .",
    "thus , the matrix elements of the electromagnetic current in the light - front formalism have the valence contribution to the electromagnetic current but also other contributions should be considered . that contribution corresponds to pair terms added to the matrix elements of the electromagnetic current  @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "one type of the vertex function is used in order to calculate the pion electromagnetic form - factor for the @xmath15 vertex .",
    "the light - front models for the pion and the kaon which were presented at previous works  @xcite are applied to high momentum transfers .    in section",
    "ii , we present the formalism for the decay constants and electromagnetic form factor of the pseudoscalar mesons for a nonsymmetric vertex model . in our calculations",
    ", we also use a symmetric vertex model of the pion and kaon given in this section . in the last section ,",
    "we show our numerical results for the ratio between the kaon and pion electromagnetic form factors .",
    "we also discuss the main relevant points of the results .",
    ".25 cm    the electromagnetic form factor for pseudoscalar particles can be obtained from a covariant expression as : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the electromagnetic current and @xmath18 is the pseudoscalar electromagnetic form factor .",
    "the pseudoscalar pion decay constant is given by @xmath19 \\lambda_m(k , p)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20      .25 cm the pion electromagnetic current can be written as : @xmath21 in the equation above , in general , it is possible to extract the form factor using either the plus or minus components of the electromagnetic current , @xmath13 and @xmath22 , respectively . in a reference frame , where the plus component of the moment transfer @xmath23 is nonzero , the electromagnetic form factor has two contributions : @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the valence and the non - valence terms , respectively .",
    ".parameters for the nonsymmetric vertex model ( nsm ) and the light - front covariant model ( lfcm ) .",
    "the scale parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 are fitted to the corresponding decay constants . [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     from the analytical integration of the @xmath29 loop momentum in eq .",
    "( [ ffactor ] ) , one finds two possible intervals of @xmath30 which give nonzero contribution : ( i ) @xmath31 and ( ii ) @xmath32 .",
    "the interval ( i ) corresponds to the valence contribution to the electromagnetic current and the second interval ( ii ) is the non - valence contribution .",
    "the sum of both contributions gives the covariant form factor , which depends only on @xmath8 and not on the particular value of @xmath33 .",
    "the electromagnetic form factor @xmath34 for the pion can be expressed with the nonsymmetric vertex model  ( see the reference  @xcite for details ) as : @xmath35 where with @xmath36 given by : @xmath37 @xmath38 and @xmath39 the function @xmath40 for @xmath41 is defined as @xmath42 , with @xmath43 , respectively to the sequence 1 to 5 .",
    "the constituent quark mass is @xmath44 and the regulator mass is @xmath45 given in table i.      .25 cm the expression for the kaon electromagnetic form factor is given by : @xmath46 where @xmath17 is the electromagnetic current and @xmath4 is the kaon form factor .",
    "the electromagnetic form factor of the kaon @xmath47 receives contribution form the quark and antiquark currents . with the nonsymmetric vertex  @xcite in the light - front coordinates the contribution of the quark current to the form factor can be expressed as : @xmath48 where @xmath49 and the functions @xmath50 and @xmath51 are given by : @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 with @xmath55 and @xmath56 the functions @xmath57 to @xmath58 in the equation above are defined as previously replacing @xmath44 by @xmath59 .      .25 cm the bethe - salpeter amplitude",
    "is calculated with the light - front covariant model  @xcite : where @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "@xmath62 is the scale associated with the meson light - front valence wave function , @xmath63 is the power of the regulator and @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the quark masses within the meson bound state .",
    "the parameters of our models , nsm and lfcm , are given in the table i. in figure [ lcp1 ] , we show the numerical results of the ratio between the kaon and pion electromagnetic form factors obtained with nsm compared to the experimental data . in figure [ lcp1](a ) ( upper frame )",
    ", we show our results for q@xmath1 up to 10  @xmath66 ^ 2 $ ] . in order to show in detail the comparison with available experimental data",
    ", it is presented the ratio for q@xmath1 up to 0.2  @xmath66 ^ 2 $ ] , in figure [ lcp2](b)(lower frame ) .",
    "we show in figure [ lcp2](a ) calculations for the ratio using the meson bethe - salpeter amplitude defined with the vertex given by lfcm . we compare that to the calculations with nsm up to 10  @xmath66 ^ 2 $ ] . from the figure ,",
    "it is clear the sensitivity of the ratio to the different models . from figure [ lcp2](b ) , we realize that both models can describe the experimental data up to q@xmath1= 0.2  @xmath66 ^ 2 $ ] . we conclude by observing both frames in figure [ lcp2 ] that the two models are in good agreement with the experimental data for low momentum and show significant dependence on the quark mass for high momentum transfers , which can be clearly seen for the nsm .",
    "this is possibly correlated to modification of the pion and kaon decay constant when changing the constituent quark mass , which appears at high momentum transfers as the wave functions of the pion and kaon at short distances are essentially defined by @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively .",
