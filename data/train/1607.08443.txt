    "epidemiological models have assumed new relevance in assessing spreading processes over a broad interdisciplinary spectrum . ranging from modeling malware propagation on the digital landscape @xcite to ` word - of - mouth ' influence in social networking platforms @xcite ,",
    "analysis of classical stochastic epidemic models and their deterministic approximations at microscopic and macroscopic levels have been the subject of serious scientific inquiry in recent years @xcite .",
    "much of the existing works however , are mostly concerned with the long - term characteristics of the epidemics rather than their transient behavior upto some specified time .",
    "in fact , time - dependent analysis provides deeper insight on the system behavior when the primary parameters are perturbed and thus , can serve crucial in devising effective control measures .    in regard to applications of queueing theory in quantitative analysis of epidemic progression , the authors of @xcite showed the number of infected nodes at the moment of first detection to be geometrically distributed by formulating the susceptible - infected - removed ( sir ) epidemic as an @xmath1 queue with processor sharing service discipline .",
    "approximations for the quasi - stationary distribution ( qsd ) of the number of susceptibles in the susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sis ) and susceptible - latent - infected - susceptible ( seis ) models were derived in @xcite , wherein each node was either a busy ( infected ) or an idle ( susceptible ) server in a homogeneously mixing population .",
    "similarly , analytical derivations of the qsd and transient distribution for the maximum number of infectives in a generalized sis model , described as a birth - death process , were detailed in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , to investigate the number of infectives resulting from a computer virus ( codered - ii ) attack during time interval @xmath2 $ ] , the block - structured state - dependent event ( bsde ) approach was advocated considering non - exponential and correlated infection and recovery flows in an sis - type model @xcite . in view of heterogeneous infectiousness and susceptibility in the sis model , economou _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied the behavior of the corresponding @xmath3-state markov chain formulation in the quasi - stationary regime .",
    "moreover , sahneh _ et al . _",
    "@xcite deduced the state occupancy probabilities of the sis model with multiple contact layers by reducing the exact @xmath4-state markov chain representation to a system of @xmath5 non - linear differential equations using mean - field approximation .",
    "the above works nonetheless , do not consider a recovery policy , which inherently has limited resources , within their models .    in this paper",
    ", we address the impact of infected nodes retrying for recovery controlled by limited resources on the transient behavior of the si model considering both , homogeneous and heterogeneous contacts in a finite population .",
    "we build our time - homogeneous ctmc model based upon the retrial queueing notion in which infected nodes return back to become susceptible only after being served by one of the idle recovery units . on finding all units busy , the infected node then joins a virtual buffer , known as orbit , from which it retries persistently for access until granted service by an idle unit .",
    "our main interest is to numerically investigate the transient state probability distributions of the number of infected nodes undergoing recovery and those residing in the orbit as well as their related moments under varying parametric settings which , to the best of our knowledge , has not yet been reported .",
    "an immediate practical application of our work is the time and workload dependency analysis of online computer scanning services . under a practically relevant scenario comprising of a small number of networked devices , an infected client device attempts to access a server that provides malware detection / eradication services . in reality",
    ", the number of communication ports on the server dedicated for this purpose is always limited and thus , can not serve all clients simultaneously . on arrival ,",
    "if a client finds an idle port on the server , it connects successfully to receive the required service .",
    "otherwise , the client retries randomly and independently , expecting to gain access to an idle port on the server .",
    "therefore , for a finite operation time horizon , statistical information on the proportion of infected clients being scanned and those awaiting access serves substantial to network administrators .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . the markovian retrial si model with limited recovery resources is formally introduced in section [ sec2 ] .",
    "derivations for the transient state and marginal probabilities under different contact types are provided in section [ sec3 ] , followed by numerical results in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "finally , we conclude the paper in section [ sec5 ] with directions for potential future work .",
    "to make the subsequent derivations systematic , we introduce some graph - theoretical nomenclature and the markov chain representation of the retrial si model in this section .      consider a fixed network of size @xmath0 within which a particular infection spreads .",
    "we represent such a contact network as an undirected graph @xmath6 , where @xmath7 denotes the set of constituent nodes and @xmath8 is the set of interaction links .",
    "the associated adjacency matrix of @xmath9 is given as @xmath10_{v \\times v}$ ] , where @xmath11 if @xmath12 and @xmath13 are adjacent neighbors in contact , and @xmath14 if otherwise . following the definition of matrix @xmath15",
    ", the degree of any node @xmath16 can be easily computed to be @xmath17 .       with finite recovery units ( @xmath18).,width=307 ]    [ fig1 ]",
    "we extend the standard stochastic si compartmental model by reinforcing the intrinsic retrial behavior of infected nodes contending for limited treatment resources as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . specifically , each node transitions from being in the susceptible ( * s * ) sub - population to the infected ( * i * ) sub - population , and back again to susceptible upon receiving treatment .",
    "since the population is closed , i.e. @xmath19 , the system state at time @xmath20 can be fully described by @xmath21 and @xmath22 which represent the number of recovery units @xmath23 being occupied by infected nodes and the number of retrying infected nodes in the orbit of size @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "the arrival of infected nodes is assumed to follow a poisson process with state - dependent arrival rate of @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "also , an arriving infected node undergoes recovery at one of the units for an exponentially distributed time with mean @xmath28 , after which it once again becomes susceptible to the contagion .",

    ", we assume the spread of a typical infection to be driven by homogeneous mixing in a population wherein each node makes contact with another node at random time intervals which are i.i.d .",
    "random variables @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the state - dependent arrival rate of infected nodes at the recovery units is expressed as @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the contact rate in the population . with the time - homogeneous process",
    "@xmath39 defined over @xmath47 of size @xmath48 , the transition rates dictating the retrial si model dynamics are : @xmath49 equation ( [ eq4 ] ) simply expresses the four possible cases of state transitions shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] .",

    "once identified , the stationary probability vector , @xmath88_{1\\times|\\omega|}$ ] , can also be determined using @xmath89 .",
    "the probability of finding @xmath12 infected nodes under recovery at time instant @xmath34 is given as below : @xmath90 with corresponding moments @xmath91\\!=\\!\\sum_{i=0}^c i^n p_i(t)$ ] .",
    "likewise , the marginal distribution of @xmath22 is expressed as : @xmath92 with @xmath93=\\sum_{j=0}^{n - c } j^n q_j(t)$ ] as its @xmath94 raw moment .      unlike the homogeneous counterpart , where an infected node can equally infect any susceptible node , heterogeneity in the retrial si model can be reflected in terms of non - homogeneous ( node - dependent ) infection rates over the contact network as in the works of @xcite and @xcite . to this end , we assume that any susceptible node , say @xmath95 , can be infected in two ways : ( i ) infection stemming from some external source ( outside the population ) according to a poisson process with rate @xmath96 such that @xmath97 and ( ii ) internal nodal infection following a poisson process with rate @xmath98 on @xmath95 for all susceptible nodes @xmath99 such that @xmath100 . without loss of generality ,",
    "all involved processes governing the external / internal infections , recovery , and retrial times are assumed to be mutually independent .",
    "this scenario is analogous to virus propagation in computer networks , where node @xmath95 not only receives the virus from its neighbors , but can also generate and spread its own virus . for convenience ,",
    "we denote the state - dependent arrival rate due to node @xmath95 as follows , where * i * symbolizes the sub - population of infected nodes in the network : @xmath101    by replacing @xmath102 and @xmath103 in ( [ eq4 ] ) with @xmath104 and @xmath105 , respectively , the state transition rates for the proposed model with heterogeneities can be expressed in a similar manner .",
    "repetition of the expressions for the kolmogorov forward equations and operations in the lt domain are not included here due to limited space .",
    "thus , undertaking the same approach as in the preceding sub - section , with @xmath106 defined as the probability of having @xmath12 recovering and @xmath13 orbital infected nodes due to @xmath95 at time @xmath34 ( and the other notations varied accordingly ) , the respective marginal distributions and moments can be obtained in a straightforward manner .",
    "the objective of resorting to numerical simulations in this section is to analyze the transient state behavior of the retrial si model with respect to the derived performance measures under varying parametric values so as to visualize the solutions in practical scenarios .",
    "since inverting the computed lt is quite tedious , particularly for larger values of @xmath0 and @xmath107 , we adopt the jagerman - stehfest method which is built upon the post - widder inversion formula to numerically compute the approximate results for @xmath108 $ ] and @xmath109 $ ] @xcite . throughout this section ,",
    "we assume the initial condition of the system to be @xmath110 and @xmath111 .      in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the marginal probabilities @xmath86 and @xmath87 for a well - mixed population are plotted with parameters @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 . under this parametric set - up , we observe in fig .",
    "[ fig3a ] that within time interval @xmath116 $ ] , unlike the rapid exponential decay of @xmath117 , the probability of having at least one infected node under recovery gradually rises before approaching the steady - state probability .",
    "this clearly indicates that with the infected nodes initially arriving with maximum rate @xmath118 , the probability of the recovery units being occupied increases and eventually , the probability of having all units busy ( @xmath119 ) reaches its highest in long - term with the least probability for them being all idle . on the other hand , fig .",
    "[ fig3b ] shows that @xmath120 upto @xmath121 and then reduces to its minimum value at a slower rate .",
    "dependent on the initial conditions , such behavior in interval @xmath122 $ ] is not far from expectation .",
    "as the infected nodes begin to arrive , they are immediately served by the idle units and enter the orbit only if all units are busy .",
    "thus , decrease in @xmath123 reflects the recovery units availability for service and as the number of arrivals outnumber the recovery units , the orbit gradually begins to fill up thus , reducing the probability of it being vacant .",

    "[ fig4 ] , where @xmath126 and the internal infection spreading rate from node @xmath95 to its susceptible neighbors is @xmath127 .",
    "the relatively longer transient phase ( @xmath128 $ ] ) in this figure is evidence of the impact of non - uniform infection over the contact network . in other words , since @xmath129 and @xmath130 are node degree - bounded rates , the infection spread is less spontaneous thus , resulting in a longer time for healthy nodes to get infected in comparison to uniform infectivity in fig .",

    "a common trend visible in both models is that the expected number of infectives under recovery increases with the value of @xmath107 for any arbitrary population size .",
    "increasing @xmath107 improves the chances of finding an idle recovery unit which in turn , reduces the average number of infected nodes in the orbit . the transient behavior exhibited by the retrial si model with heterogeneous infection rates however , exists for a comparatively longer time interval before reaching stationarity as shown in table  [ table2 ] . for instance , the average number of orbital nodes for @xmath133 stabilizes at @xmath134 in table  [ table1 ] ,",
    "while heterogeneity in the infection rate prolongs this convergence to @xmath135 as shown in table  [ table2 ] .",
    "it should also be noted that the system never approaches an infection - free equilibrium ( where all nodes are susceptible ) due to the state dependency of the infection rate .",

    "while the model with heterogeneities follows an identical trend , it reveals lower values for @xmath142 $ ] and @xmath144 $ ] .",

    "we presented an exact markov chain model for the si epidemic process incorporated with the retrial attempts of infected nodes instigated by a recovery policy . motivated by the significance of transient behavior statistics in practical online scanning services , we numerically obtain the marginal probability distributions of the number of recovering and orbital infectives and their corresponding moments for the proposed model under homogeneous contacts .",
    "accounting for the possibility of infections caused by external and internal sources , the study was further extended to unravel the impact of infection heterogeneity on the network characteristics .",
