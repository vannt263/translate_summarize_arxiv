    "various integral transforms are known to be extremely useful in analysis and applications .",
    "one example is the fourier transform in analysis and applied problems ; another example is the segal - bargmann transform @xcite in quantum theory .",
    "an important common property of integral transforms is that they relate various spaces of functions and various operators on these spaces and allow one to `` transplant '' a problem from one space to another one . because of",
    "that , the problem at hand may become easier to solve .",
    "a somewhat similar situation arises when working with tensor equations in the finite dimensional setting .",
    "namely , by an appropriate choice of coordinates one can significantly simplify a given tensor equation .",
    "although the analogy is obvious , an infinite - dimensional setting offers a significantly larger variety of situations .",
    "in particular , by using the segal - bargmann transform , one can relate problems on spaces of ordinary or even generalized functions to problems on spaces of holomorphic functions .    in the paper we attempt to build a systematic approach to functional transformations on hilbert spaces based on the above mentioned analogy between integral transforms and changes of coordinates on an @xmath0-dimensional manifold .",
    "initial results in this direction were announced in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "various application of the formalism to quantum theory especially to the problem of emergence of the classical space - time were considered in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the goal here is to approach the subject in a more formal mathematical way and to justify the previously obtained results .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for an introduction to hilbert spaces and applications .",
    "we begin by describing a method of building various hilbert spaces of functions including spaces of smooth and generalized functions .",
    "then a simple formalism based on isomorphisms of these spaces is constructed .",
    "the formalism allows one to `` move '' in a systematic way between hilbert spaces of functions and at the same time to formulate problems in a way independent of any particular functional realization .",
    "the formalism is then applied to building linear algebra on hilbert spaces which deals with the ordinary and the generalized functions on an equal footing . after discussing various special transformations preserving properties of differential operators we concentrate on differential geometry of hilbert spaces of functions .",
    "namely , using the developed formalism we find a natural isometric embedding of finite dimensional riemannian manifolds into hilbert spaces of functions . finally , the formalism is applied to construct a riemannian metric on the unit sphere in a hilbert space in such a way that solutions of schrdinger equation are geodesics on the sphere .",
    "let us discuss first a general method of constructing various hilbert spaces of smooth and generalized functions .",
    "consider the convolution @xmath3 of a function @xmath4 and the gaussian function @xmath5 .",
    "it is the standard result that such a convolution is in @xmath6 and @xmath7 for any order @xmath8 of the derivative @xmath9 .    _",
    "proof_. the operator @xmath10 is bounded because @xmath11 .",
    "to check that it is invertible , assume that @xmath12 and differentiate both sides of this equation an arbitrary number of times @xmath8 .",
    "we then conclude that all fourier coefficients @xmath13 of @xmath14 in the orthonormal in @xmath15 basis of hermite functions vanish .    the operator @xmath10 induces the hilbert metric on the image @xmath16 by @xmath17 in particular , the space @xmath18 with this metric is hilbert .    _",
    "proof_. we have @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a constant .",
    "in addition , the functions @xmath21 , @xmath22 , being in @xmath18 , form a complete system in @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , @xmath18 is dense in @xmath15 .",
    "provided we identify those linear functionals on @xmath18 and @xmath15 which are equal on @xmath18 , we then have @xmath23 indeed , any functional continuous on @xmath24 will be continuous on @xmath18 .    _",
    "proof_. because @xmath25 , for any @xmath26 we have @xmath27 that is , we have a continuous embedding @xmath28 .    by riesz theorem",
    "the norm on @xmath29 is induced by the inner product @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the riesz isomorphism .",
    "similarly for @xmath34 .    on the other hand , since @xmath35 is an isomorphism of hilbert spaces , the adjoint operator @xmath36 , defined for any @xmath37 , @xmath38 by @xmath39 is continuous and invertible ( with @xmath40 ) .    _",
    "proof_. for any @xmath41 the inner product @xmath42 induced by @xmath43 is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 defines the metric on @xmath29 .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath46 and @xmath47 , then @xmath48 , and @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the riesz isomorphism . therefore , metric ( [ i ] ) on @xmath29 can be written as follows : @xmath51 from ( [ rrr ] ) we conclude that @xmath52 . also , because the inner products ( [ ii ] ) and ( [ iii ] ) coincide , @xmath43 is an isomorphism of hilbert spaces @xmath29 and @xmath34 .",
    "because the kernel of @xmath10 is given by @xmath53 , the kernel @xmath54 of @xmath55 , computed up to a constant factor , is equal to @xmath56 therefore , the inner product on @xmath29 can be written as @xmath57 note that the integral symbol here denotes the action of the bilinear functional @xmath58 on @xmath59 . only in special cases",
    "does this action coincides with lebesgue integration with respect to @xmath60 .",
    "_ proof_. the sequence @xmath61 is fundamental in @xmath29 and",
    "so it converges in @xmath29 . also , the sequence @xmath62 is a delta - converging sequence , so that @xmath63 as @xmath64 for any @xmath65",
    ". in particular , @xmath62 strongly converges to the evaluation functional @xmath66 in @xmath29 .",
    "formally , @xmath67    note that the inner product on @xmath15 can be written in the form @xmath68 where @xmath69 denote the convolution @xmath70 .",
    "the main difference between metrics ( [ no ] ) and ( [ inn_l ] ) is that the metric on @xmath15 is `` diagonal '' , while the metric on @xmath29 is not .",
    "consider now yet another hilbert space obtained in a similar fashion .",
    "for this note that since @xmath71 , the fourier transform @xmath72 on @xmath18 is defined .",
    "moreover , @xmath72 induces a hilbert metric on the image @xmath73 by @xmath74 for any @xmath75 in @xmath18 .",
    "we can then define the fourier transform on @xmath29 in the standard way by @xmath76 for any @xmath37 and @xmath65 .",
    "the image @xmath77 is the hilbert space @xmath78 dual to @xmath79 .",
    "the metric on this space is induced by the map @xmath80 : @xmath81 in other words , the metric on @xmath78 is given by @xmath82 .",
    "the kernel of this metric is then equal to @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the kernel of the operator @xmath85 of convolution with the delta function .",
    "note that because of the weight @xmath86 , the space @xmath78 contains the plane wave functions @xmath87 .",
    "so , we have the hilbert space @xmath18 of @xmath2 ( in fact , analytic ) functions , its dual @xmath29 containing singular generalized functions , in particular , @xmath88 , @xmath89 .",
    "we also have the fourier transformed space @xmath79 and its dual @xmath78 , which contains , in particular , the plane wave function @xmath90 .    the method used to construct the above spaces of generalized functions",
    "is very general .",
    "all we need is a linear injective map @xmath10 on a space @xmath24 of square - integrable functions . by changing @xmath10",
    ", we change the metric @xmath91 on the hilbert space @xmath92 and therefore the metric @xmath55 on the dual space @xmath29 . roughly speaking , by  smoothing \" the kernel of the metric @xmath55 , we extend the class of ( generalized ) functions for which the norm defined by this metric is finite .",
    "the same is true if we ",
    "improve \" the behavior of the metric for large @xmath93 .",
    "conversely , by  spoiling the metric \" we make the corresponding hilbert space  poor \" in terms of a variety of the elements of the space .",
    "this is further illustrated by the following theorem .",
    "_ from _ theorem 2.1 _ we immediately conclude that the map @xmath10 is injective and the image @xmath94 consists of @xmath2 functions .",
    "moreover , we have @xmath95 where @xmath20 is a constant . in particular",
    ", the functions in @xmath94 decrease faster than any power of @xmath96 .",
    "now , the topology on @xmath97 may be defined by the countable system of norms @xmath98 where @xmath99 are nonnegative integers and @xmath100 is the derivative of @xmath101 of order @xmath102 . for any @xmath65 by the schwarz inequality we have : @xmath103 where @xmath104 , @xmath105 is a polynomial of degree @xmath102 and @xmath106 are constants depending only on @xmath107 .",
    "this proves that topology on @xmath18 is stronger then topology on @xmath97 , i.e. @xmath108 is a continuous embedding .",
    "it follows from the theorem that @xmath109 as a set .",
    "in fact , any functional continuous on @xmath97 will be continuous on @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , by choosing the strong topology on @xmath110 one can show that the embedding of @xmath110 into @xmath29 is continuous .",
    "notice also that one could choose the weak topology on @xmath110 instead as the weak and strong topologies on @xmath110 are equivalent @xcite .     1 .",
    "the considered hilbert spaces of generalized functions could have been also obtained by completing spaces of ordinary functions with respect to the discussed inner products . more generally , in many cases the expression @xmath111 where @xmath112 is a continuous function on a region @xmath9 in @xmath113 defines an inner product on @xmath114",
    ". then the completion with respect to the corresponding metric yields a hilbert space containing singular generalized functions .",
    "the isomorphism @xmath10 defined on @xmath15 by @xmath115 is closely related to the segal - bargmann transform @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the space of holomorphic functions on @xmath118 , given by @xmath119 the theorem by segal - bargmann @xcite ( see also @xcite ) says the following .",
    "let us also remark that hilbert spaces on which the action of pointwise evaluation functional is continuous are often called _ reproducing kernel hilbert spaces_.",
    "consider the _ generalized eigenvalue problem _ for a linear operator @xmath120 on a hilbert space @xmath18 : @xmath121 the problem consists in finding all functionals @xmath37 and the corresponding numbers @xmath122 for which the equation ( [ eigen_new ] ) is satisfied for all functions @xmath123 in a hilbert space @xmath18 of functions .",
    "for instance , let @xmath79 be the hilbert space with the metric ( [ hsig ] ) .",
    "as we know , the metric on the dual space @xmath78 is given by the kernel @xmath124 .",
    "the generalized eigenvalue problem for the operator @xmath125 is given by @xmath126 the equation ( [ eigenvalue1 ] ) must be satisfied for every @xmath123 in @xmath79 .",
    "the functionals @xmath127 are the eigenvectors of @xmath128 .",
    "note that these eigenvectors belong to @xmath78 so that the generalized eigenvalue problem has a solution .",
    "as before , the fourier transform @xmath129 , @xmath130 induces a hilbert structure on the space @xmath131 .",
    "relative to this structure @xmath72 is an isomorphism of the hilbert spaces @xmath132 and @xmath18 .",
    "the inverse transform @xmath133 is given by @xmath134 notice that the fourier transform of @xmath90 is @xmath135 which is to say again that the space @xmath29 dual to @xmath18 contains delta - functions . as we know from ( [ k ] ) , the kernel of the metric on @xmath29 is proportional to @xmath136 .    using transformations @xmath137 we can rewrite the generalized eigenvalue problem ( [ eigenvalue1 ] ) as @xmath138 where @xmath139 .",
    "we have : @xmath140 therefore , @xmath141 so , the new eigenvalue problem is as follows : @xmath142 thus , we have the eigenvalue problem for the operator of multiplication by the variable .",
    "the eigenfunctions here are the elements of @xmath29 given by @xmath143 where @xmath144 .",
    "indeed , @xmath145    two important things are happening here .",
    "first of all , for the given operator @xmath120 we have been able to find an appropriate hilbert space of generalized functions so that the generalized eigenvectors of the operator are its elements . we also conclude that each eigenvalue problem actually defines a whole family of `` unitary equivalent '' problems obtained via isomorphisms of hilbert spaces .",
    "this is analogous to the case of a single tensor equation on @xmath146 considered in different linear coordinates ( i.e. in different bases ) . instead of a change in _ numeric _ components of vectors and other tensors we now have a change in functions , operators on spaces of functions etc .",
    "the idea is then to consider different equivalence classes of functional objects related by isomorphisms of hilbert spaces as realizations of invariant objects , which themselves are independent of any particular functional realization . in particular , the eigenvalue problems ( [ eigenvalue1 ] ) , and ( [ eigenvalue2 ] )",
    "can be considered as two coordinate expressions of a single equation which is itself independent of a chosen realization . in applications , such realizations ,",
    "although mathematically equivalent , may represent different physical situations . in the next section this approach will be formalized .",
    "here are the main definitions : a _ string space _ @xmath147 is an abstract topological vector space topologically linearly isomorphic to a separable hilbert space .    the elements @xmath148 of @xmath147 are called strings .    a _ hilbert space of functions _ ( or a _ coordinate space _ ) is either a hilbert space @xmath18 , elements of which are equivalence classes of maps between two given subsets of @xmath146 or the hilbert space @xmath149 dual to @xmath18 .    a linear isomorphism @xmath150 from a hilbert space @xmath18 of functions onto @xmath147 is called a _ string basis _ ( or a _ functional basis _ ) on @xmath147 .    the inverse map @xmath151 is called a _ linear coordinate system on @xmath152 _ ( or a _ linear functional coordinate system _ ) .    :",
    "@xmath152 is analogous to the abstract @xmath0-dimensional vector space @xmath153 .",
    "a coordinate space @xmath18 is analogous to a particular realization @xmath146 of @xmath153 as a space of column vectors .",
    "a string basis @xmath154 is analogous to the ordinary basis @xmath155 on @xmath153 .",
    "namely , the string basis identifies a string with a function : if @xmath156 , then @xmath157 for a unique @xmath65 . the ordinary basis @xmath155 identifies a vector with a column of numbers .",
    "it can be therefore identified with an isomorphism @xmath158 .",

    ", any separable hilbert space @xmath152 can be realized as a space @xmath160 of sequences by means of an orthonormal basis on @xmath152 .",
    "so it seems that we already have a clear infinite - dimensional analogue of the @xmath0-dimensional vector space .",
    "however , such a realization is too restrictive .",
    "in fact , unlike the case of a finite number of dimensions , there exist various realizations of @xmath152 as a space of functions .",
    "these realizations are also `` numeric '' and useful in applications and they should not be discarded .",

    "will illustrate the importance of these two aspects .",
