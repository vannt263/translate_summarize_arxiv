    "understanding when and how galaxies built up their stellar mass is one of the most important issues in observational cosmology and galaxy formation . since the stellar mass of a galaxy",
    "is generally dominated by long - lived low - mass stars , it is considered as the integral of the past star formation rate . then , the evolution of the cosmic stellar mass density provides a global picture of the past history of star formation in the universe .",
    "recent near - infrared ( nir ) surveys allow us to measure the average stellar mass density of the universe directly from low to high redshift ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . at @xmath21 ,",
    "many previous studies found the relatively mild evolution of the average stellar mass density , although there has been a significant evolution of the relative contributions from different morphological types or different sed / color types to the total stellar mass density ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , at @xmath20 , a rapid evolution of the stellar mass density has been observed by studies based on deep surveys ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and a significant fraction of the stellar mass in the present universe seems to have been formed at that epoch .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with results that the average star formation rate density in the universe peaked around @xmath22 13 ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , although several studies pointed out a quantitative discrepancy between the evolution of the cosmic star formation rate density and the stellar mass density ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "stellar mass function ( smf ) of galaxies and its evolution over cosmic time provide additional information on how stellar mass assembly of galaxies proceeded in different mass ranges , while the evolution of the integrated stellar mass density enables us to investigate when stars formed in the universe as mentioned above . in paticular",
    ", the evolution of the number density of massive ( e.g. , m@xmath23m@xmath11 ) galaxies has been extensively studied in order to address when massive galaxies assembled , which is considered as an important test for galaxy formation models ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "while the comoving number density of these massive galaxies shows no significant evolution at @xmath21 , it decreases significantly with redshift at @xmath20 , although the observed number density of very massive galaxies at @xmath22 23 seems to be still higher than the predictions of the hierarchical galaxy formation models ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in order to understand how the stellar mass assembly of massive galaxies proceeded , studies for the evolution of lower mass galaxies are also important , since many low - mass objects at high redshift are expected to merge over cosmic time to form massive galaxies in hierarchical structure formation scenarios .",
    "the hierarchical merging process generally destroys small galaxies and builds massive galaxies , and therefore this process is expected to change the shape of the smf , for example , to increase the characteristic mass of the schechter function and/or to flatten the low - mass slope with time . in order to address the shape of the smf reliably ,",
    "it is essential to have a large sample of galaxies over a wide range of stellar mass .    to investigate the evolution of galaxies over a wide range of mass is also important in the context of the ` downsizing ' scenario . in the local universe ,",
    "massive galaxies tend to have redder color and older stellar population , while most low - mass galaxies are young and actively star - forming ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the star formation histories of galaxies depend strongly on their stellar mass ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore the histories of the stellar mass assembly of high and low - mass galaxies could also be different .",
    "for example , higher star formation rate relative to stellar mass ( i.e. , specific star formation rate ) of low - mass galaxies is expected to lead to higher growth rate of their stellar mass than that of massive galaxies , if the effect of galaxy mergers is ignored .",
    "in fact , several studies reported that the most massive galaxies with m@xmath24 - 10@xmath25m@xmath11 show milder evolution in number density at @xmath26 than galaxies with m@xmath27 - 10@xmath28m@xmath11 , i.e. , the mass - dependent evolution of the number density of massive galaxies ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . at @xmath29 11.3",
    ", it was also observed that lower mass galaxies with m@xmath30 - 10@xmath19m@xmath11 evolve faster than massive galaxies ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , it is difficult to extend the investigation of galaxies over a wide range of stellar mass up to @xmath22 13 , which is an important era in the histories of the stellar mass assembly of galaxies .",
    "this is because very deep nir data are necessary to unbiasedly sample galaxies at high redshift down to low stellar mass , e.g. , @xmath31-@xmath32m@xmath11 ( @xcite ) .",
    "nir data sample the rest - frame optical to nir for galaxies at @xmath22 13 .",
    "since nir luminosity reflects total stellar mass of a galaxy relatively well ( e.g. , @xcite ) and is not strongly affected by dust extinction , nir data are more suitable for construction of stellar mass limited samples than shorter wavelength data .",
    "nir data are also important in that they straddle the redshifted balmer/4000  break of these high - z galaxies , which is correlated strongly with the stellar m / l ratio and enables us to estimate stellar mass with high accuracy . since such deep nir data have been very limited so far , only a few studies investigated the evolution of the shape of the smf up to @xmath22 13 using ultra deep nir data with relatively small survey areas ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we use very deep and wide nir data obtained in moircs deep survey ( mods ; @xcite , @xcite ) with publicly available multi - wavelength data in the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods , @xcite ) in order to investigate the evolution of the smf of galaxies back to @xmath0 .",
    "the wide and deep nir data allow us to construct a statistically large galaxy sample over a wide range of stellar mass even at high redshift .",
    "section 2 describes the data set and the procedures of source detection and photometry .",
    "we present methods for constructing the smf and investigate its evolution in section 3 . in section 4 , we compare the results with previous studies and discuss their implications for galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "a summary is provided in section 5 .",

    "the vega - referred magnitude system is used throughout this paper .",
    "in the moircs deep survey , we obtained the very deep @xmath37-bands imaging data in the field of goods - north with multi - object infrared camera and spectrograph ( moircs , @xcite , @xcite ) mounted on the subaru telescope .",
    "the observations were carried out in the period from 2006 april to 2008 may .",
    "we also used archival moircs data obtained by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "four moircs pointings cover @xmath12 70% of the goods - north region ( @xmath12 103.3 arcmin@xmath5 , hereafter referred as ` wide ' field ) and the total exposure time is 6.39.1 hours in @xmath38-band , 2.5 - 4.3 hours in @xmath39-band and 8.3 - 10.7 hours in @xmath40-band .",

    "hdf - n , @xcite ) , is also the ultra - deep field of the mods ( hereafter ` deep ' field ) , where the exposure time is 28.2 hours in @xmath38-band , 5.7 hours in @xmath39-band and 28.0 hours in @xmath40-band .",
    "the data were reduced using a purpose - made iraf - based software package called _",
    "mcsred_. the reduction procedures were as described in @xcite except that a defringing process was additionally applied .",
    "a standard star p177-d @xcite was used for flux calibration . in a photometric night , object frames for flux calibration were observed immediately after the standard star at similar airmass in all 4 pointings in @xmath37-bands . before combining the object frames ,",
    "all frames were scaled to the count level of these calibration frames using relatively bright unsaturated sources .",
    "we discarded the frames where the count level was very low ( less than 70% of the calibration frame ) or the image quality was bad ( fwhm of the psf larger than 1.2 arcsec for the wide field and 0.8 arcsec for the deep field ) .",
    "the combined data reach @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( 5@xmath4 , vega magnitude ) for the wide field and @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 for the deep field .",
    "further details of the observations , reduction and quality of the data will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( kajisawa et al . in preparation ) .",
    "the source detection was performed in the @xmath40-band image using the sextractor image analysis package ( @xcite ) .",

    "the detection completeness for point sources is more than 90% at the @xmath41-band limits in the both samples and the false detection rate is expected to be less than @xmath12 1% from the simulation of the source detection on the inverse @xmath40-band image with the same detection parameters ( kajisawa et al . in preparation ) .",
    "we detected 6402 and 3203 sources above the @xmath41-band limits in the wide and deep fields , respectively .    in order to measure the optical - to - mir spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of the detected objects",

    "these multi - band images were aligned to the @xmath40-band image .",
    "the acs and moircs images were convolved to match the data with the poorest seeing for the both wide ( to @xmath12 0.6 arcsec fwhm ) and deep ( to @xmath12 0.5 arcsec fwhm ) samples . for the color measurements",
    ", we used a fixed aperture size with a diameter of 1.2 ( 1.0 for the deep sample ) arcsec ( @xmath50 seeing fwhm ) for the acs and moircs data . for mosaic ( @xmath44-band ) and irac ( 3.6@xmath49 m , 4.5@xmath49 m , 5.8@xmath49 m ) data , we first performed the aperture photometry of the wide(deep ) sample with aperture sizes of 2.28(2.39 ) , 2.89(3.07 ) , 3.05(3.24 ) , 3.80(4.02 ) arcsec , respectively , and then applied the aperture correction by using the light profiles of the @xmath45- and @xmath40-bands images smoothed to match the resolution of @xmath44-band and irac images , respectively ( see kajisawa et al . in preparation for details ) .",
    "in the following analysis , we use objects which are detected above 2@xmath4 level in more than three bands ( @xmath40-band and other two bands ) because it is difficult to estimate the photometric redshift and stellar mass of those detected only in one or two bands . in the wide and deep @xmath41-band magnitude",

    "the wide and deep samples consist of 6381 and 3161 objects , respectively , and the total number of objects used are 7563 , in which 1979 objects with @xmath42 in the deep field are included in the both samples .",
    "in order to estimate the photometric redshift and stellar mass of the sample galaxies , we performed sed fitting of the multi - band photometry described above ( @xmath51 , 3.6@xmath49 m , 4.5@xmath49 m , 5.8@xmath49 m ) with population synthesis models .",

    "for these objects , the sed fitting was performed fixing the redshift to each spectroscopic value .                    in this study , three models , i.e. , galaxev ( @xcite ) , pegase version 2 ( @xcite ) and @xcite model , were used as sed templates .",
    "comparisons among the results with different sed template sets allow us to check the systematic effects of these models on the estimate of redshift and stellar mass .",

    "then we added random offsets to the multi - band photometry according to the measured photometric errors , and adopted the mock object if the resulting @xmath41-band magnitude of the object was brighter than the magnitude limits ( @xmath42 for the wide sample and @xmath43 for the deep sample ) .",
    "we repeated this procedure and made the mock catalogs with the same sample sizes as the observed wide and deep samples .",
    "the same sed fitting procedure as for the observed one was performed in order to estimate the photometric redshift and stellar mass of the mock objects . for objects with spectroscopic identification ,",
    "redshifts are fixed to the spectroscopic values .",
    "we performed 200 simulations and calculated the best - fit schechter parameters in each simulation with the sty method .",
    "figure [ fig : masim ] shows the results of the simulation in the case with galaxev ( the results for the other models are similar ) .",
    "a relatively large scatter of @xmath70 is seen in the highest redshift bin , which probably reflects the large degeneracy between m@xmath114 and @xmath70 due to the large limiting mass .",

    "however , since the observed evolution of @xmath70 is much stronger than the systematic effects in figure [ fig : masim ] , the observed steepening of the low - mass slope at high redshift is significant , especially at @xmath115 .    in the simulation",
    ", the random offsets added to the multi - band photometry and the recalculation of the photometric redshift include the effect of the catastrophic failure .",
    "we extracted the mock objects whose photometric redshift was changed catastrophically ( @xmath116 ) by the random offsets and checked the effect of these objects on the resulting smf .",
    "figure [ fig : catas ] shows the fractional increase and decrease of the number of galaxies due to the catastrophic failure of the photometric redshift as a function of stellar mass in each redshift bin . at @xmath117 , there is @xmath12 10 - 20% decrease near the limiting stellar mass , while there is only negligible effect of the catastrophic failure at m@xmath118m@xmath11 .",

    "the effect of the catastrophic failure is similar or even smaller than that at low redshift .",
    "furthermore , the contamination from lower redshift and the dropout from the redshift bin tend to be canceled out with each other , which results in the negligible effect on the smf .    in figure [",
    "fig : phiasim ] , we also show the results of the same simulation on the @xmath70-@xmath71 plane to investigate the effect on the normalization .",
    "the systematic effect on the normalization of the smf due to the photometric redshift errors seems to be relatively small , although the degeneracy between the parameters makes direct comparison difficult .",
    "next , we discuss a possibility of the over - deblending of faint objects with relatively low s / n ratio near the detection limit .",
    "although the @xmath41-band , where we performed the source detection , corresponds to the rest - frame @xmath45-band even at @xmath120 , the morphological k - correction could enhance the over - deblending at high redshift because galaxies tend to show the patchy appearance in shorter wavelengths due to the dominance of young stars and the dust extinction ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) . figure [ fig : deblend ] shows the fraction of the objects with the deblending flag by sextractor as a function of stellar mass in each redshift bin for the wide and deep samples .",
    "we can not see the mass nor redshift dependence of the fraction of the deblended objects .",
    "we conclude that the effect of deblending does not cause the evolution of the low - mass slope .    finally , we estimated the stellar mass of galaxies in the highest redshift bin with the galaxev templates with two - component ( old and young ) star formation histories .",
    "if the old stellar population is hidden by recent star formation , the stellar mass could be underestimated especially for relatively blue low - mass galaxies at high redshift , where the s / n ratio tends to be low ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we used the exponentially decaying star formation models ( young component ) with an old population component .",
    "for the young population , free parameters are stellar age , star formation timescale @xmath54 , color excess , metallicity ( same as for one - component star - formation history ) . for the old component , we limited the star formation timescale and stellar age to shorter and older values than the young population , respectively , and assumed no dust extinction .",
    "figure [ fig : twocomp ] shows the comparison of the stellar masses estimated with one- and two - component models for galaxies at @xmath79 .",
    "no significant systematic difference of the stellar mass can be seen .",
    "the scatter is consistent with the uncertainty of the stellar mass of these galaxies shown in figure [ fig : sigms ] , although the stellar mass with the two - component model is slightly larger for a small fraction of galaxies at low - mass end .",
    "the long wavelength data with spitzer / irac , which sample the rest - frame nir region even at high redshift , could make the systematic uncertainty relatively small ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",

    "a slightly large value at @xmath76 is probably due to the large scale structures around the hdf - n mentioned above . as discussed in section [ sec : result ] , the maraston model gives systematically lower stellar mass density , which is about three - quarters of those with the other two models ( galaxev and pegase2 ) at @xmath76 , about two - thirds at @xmath124 and about a half at @xmath81 .    in figure [",
    "fig : mscomp ] we compare the smf of galaxies in the mods field with those in other studies . for simplicity",

    "the agreement of the smf at the massive end is consistent with the comparison of the integrated stellar mass density because galaxies around m@xmath18 ( @xmath88m@xmath11 ) dominate the stellar mass density ( e.g. , @xcite , see also next subsection ) .",
    "no significant evolution of m@xmath18 seen in the mods field at @xmath101 is also consistent with results of previous studies ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , at the lower mass of the smf , there is some variance in different fields including the mods field in spite of the relatively small statistical errors .",
    "in addition to the differences in the normalization , which are similar offsets with those at the massive end , there is differences in the low - mass slope especially at high redshift .",
    "one possible reason for this is the different depths of the surveys and therefore the different limiting stellar masses .",
    "the smf in the mods field shows a slight upturn around @xmath1210@xmath10m@xmath11 and a steeper slope at @xmath126m@xmath11 , although this is marginal in the highest redshift bin .",
    "this indication can be seen in the results with all sed models ( figure [ fig : mfeach ] ) and does not depend on the systematic error of the photometric redshift and stellar m / l ratio .",
    "similar upturns in the smf are also seen in field galaxies in the local universe @xcite and at intermediate and high redshift ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore the relatively shallow survey with the limiting stellar mass larger than @xmath127m@xmath11 could miss the upturn and result in the systematically flatter low - mass slope even if the completeness to the limit is sufficiently high or the incompleteness correction is properly done .",
    "for example , the smfs from the different surveys show consistent low - mass slopes in the @xmath76 bin in figure [ fig : mscomp ] , where all the surveys reach below 10@xmath10m@xmath11 . at @xmath124 ,",
    "several surveys reach only to @xmath1210@xmath10m@xmath11 .",
    "while the slope at 10@xmath10 - 10@xmath19m@xmath11 is similar with those in other surveys , the smf in the mods field shows the steeper slope at 10@xmath9 - 10@xmath10 m@xmath11 than that at larger stellar mass",

    "is fixed to the weighted mean value @xmath128 , which is constrained mainly by galaxies at relatively low redshift ( @xmath21 , their figure 7 ) .",
    "@xcite discussed the effects of various random and systematic uncertainties on the estimate of the schechter parameters of the smf and suggested that the uncertainty of the low - mass slope in their analysis is relatively large especially at high redshift due to the statistical error and the systematic errors of the different sed models .",
    "the difference in the low - mass slope between @xcite and the present study could be attributed to field - to - field variance . in the local universe ,",
    "several studies suggest that the shape of the smf depends on the environment of galaxies ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and this could be the case at higher redshift ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in @xcite ,",
    "the low - mass slope at high redshift is constrained mainly by the fires data , whose survey area is about a fifth of our study .",
    "if the shape of the smf depends on the environment even at high redshift , the low - mass slope estimated from the small area surveys could be affected by the field - to - field variance . a larger area survey with a similar or fainter limiting magnitude in the nir wavelength",
    "is needed to conclude whether there exists the field - to - field variance of the shape of the smf at @xmath22 23 or not .",
    "the decrease of the overall number density and the steepening of the low - mass slope with redshift seen in the evolution of the smf of galaxies in the mods field suggest the possibility of the mass - dependent number density evolution .",
    "figure [ fig : ndeach ] shows the evolution of the number density of galaxies in different stellar mass ranges for the different sed models . relatively low - mass galaxies with the stellar mass of 10@xmath129 - 10@xmath130m@xmath11 tend to show a weaker evolution of the number density especially at @xmath131 than m@xmath114 ( @xmath88m@xmath11 ) galaxies , although the trend is relatively marginal in the results with the galaxev / pegase2 models .",
    "the relative number density of low - mass galaxies had been larger at high redshift than that in the local universe . in other words ,",
    "the number density of galaxies around m@xmath114 might have more rapidly increased at @xmath131 than that of low - mass galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "several studies based on wide area but shallow surveys suggest that for m@xmath132m@xmath11 , more massive ( e.g. , @xmath133 10@xmath28 - 10@xmath25m@xmath11 ) galaxies show weaker evolution in the number density at @xmath131 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "although the survey volume of the present study is not large enough to constrain strongly the number density of very massive galaxies with 10@xmath28 - 10@xmath25m@xmath11 , galaxies around @xmath134m@xmath11 might have been formed effectively at @xmath26 compared with higher and lower mass galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig : mdeach ] shows the contribution of galaxies in different stellar mass ranges to the cosmic stellar mass density . while the stellar mass density is dominated by massive galaxies with m@xmath135m@xmath11 in the local universe , the contribution of lower mass galaxies increases with redshift and is significant at @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite reported a relatively steep faint - end slope ( @xmath136 ) of the luminosity function for lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath137 .",
    "they estimated the stellar mass of faint lbgs with the log - linear relation between sfr and stellar mass derived in @xcite , and suggested that those faint lbgs , which typically have m@xmath138m@xmath11 ( figure 12 in @xcite ) , show a significant contribution to the total stellar mass density . since most low - mass galaxies at @xmath22 23 have rather blue rest - frame colors ( typically rest @xmath1390 , figure [ fig : uvms ] , @xcite , @xcite ) and satisfy the lbg criteria @xcite , the steep low - mass slope of the smf at high redshift in our study seems to be consistent with the result in @xcite .",
    "note that the integrated stellar mass density in the mods field is consistent with those of other previous studies as mentioned in the previous subsection , but about a half of the estimate in @xcite . then , although the contribution of low - mass galaxies to the total stellar mass density in the mods field is larger than those estimated in previous studies , the stellar mass density is still smaller than that expected from the evolution of the cosmic sfr density ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "what is the origin of the evolution of the low - mass slope ?",
    "in hierarchical structure formation scenarios , low - mass objects continue to grow by merging over cosmic time and result in more massive objects at later epochs .",
    "therefore one can expect the steeper low - mass slope at the higher redshift ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig : sma ] compares the observed smf in the mods field with the predictions of the publicly available semi - analytic models by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these two models are based on the millennium simulation of the growth of dark matter structure in a @xmath140cdm cosmology @xcite but are made by the different procedures in many aspects such as , e.g. , the construction of halo merger trees , the implementation of the star formation , the feedback by supernova explosions and agn activities .",
    "we convolved these model predictions with the gaussian representing the uncertainty of the stellar mass estimate shown in figure [ fig : sigms ] .",
    "the median value in figure [ fig : sigms ] is chosen as the width of the gaussian depending on galaxy s stellar mass and redshift . in the models",
    ", the low - mass slope similarly steepens with redshift in figure [ fig : sma ] .",
    "however , it should be noted that there are discrepancies between the observation and the models in the detailed shape of the smf and that the evolution of the overall number density of model galaxies is significantly weaker ( i.e. , larger number density at high redshift ) than that of the present observation especially at low mass as in previous studies ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , several studies found that semi - analytic models tend to predict the smaller number density of galaxies at the massive end ( m@xmath141-@xmath142m@xmath11 ) than observations ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) . a similar indication is also seen in figure [ fig : sma ] , although our data can not strongly constrain the number density of these very massive galaxies .",
    "since the stellar mass of a galaxy is generally dominated by long - lived low - mass stars , it can be generally considered as the integral of the past star formation rate and expected to increase monotonically with time .",
    "therefore , for example , only suppression of star formation in low - mass galaxies can not cause the flattening of the low - mass slope of the smf with time , while it could lead to the evolution of the faint - end slope of the rest - frame uv luminosity function , which directly reflects the star formation rate , as discussed in @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the stellar mass growth by star formation activities in each galaxy could change the slope of the smf .",
    "there are several observational studies that suggest that low - mass galaxies have higher star formation rate relative to their stellar mass ( i.e. , sfr / m@xmath143 , specific star formation rate ) than massive galaxies even at @xmath22 23 ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "these results for the mass dependence of sfr / m@xmath143 suggest that the expected growth rate of stellar mass by star formation activities in a galaxy is higher in lower mass galaxies .",
    "if we assume the observed trends of the low - mass slope and mass dependence of sfr / m@xmath143 continue down to lower mass , a net increase of the number of galaxies in a mass bin due to star formation activities ( inflow from lower mass bins @xmath144 outflow into higher mass bins ) is expected to be larger at lower stellar mass , which leads to the steepening of the low - mass slope with time , i.e. , opposite to that seen in figures [ fig : mfeach ] and [ fig : mfall ] .",
    "for example , @xcite calculated the expected change of the smf due to star formation only from the average star formation rate at each stellar mass of galaxies in the fors deep field @xcite and showed that the number density of lower mass galaxies is expected to increase more rapidly with time especially at @xmath29 3 . by subtracting the expected contribution due to star formation from the observed redshift evolution of the smf",
    ", @xcite evaluated the effect of the hierarchical merging on the evolution of the smf ( i.e. , destroying small galaxies and building more massive ones ) . in their analysis , at m@xmath145m@xmath11 , lower mass galaxies tend to be consumed in mergers at higher rate to counterbalance the effect of the mass - dependent star formation rate .",
    "since no evolution of the low - mass end slope is assumed in @xcite , the steepening with redshift indicates the effect of merging larger than that estimated in @xcite .",
    "therefore the evolution of the smf of galaxies in the mods field suggests that the hierarchical merging process was important for the stellar mass assembly of these low - mass galaxies at @xmath22 13 , when the cosmic stellar mass density had been increasing rapidly .",
    "the relatively high fraction of peculiar / irregular morphology in low - mass galaxies at @xmath90 in the nir wavelength ( @xcite , @xcite ) might also imply intense merging activity of these galaxies .    in this context ,",
    "the fact that low - mass galaxies tend to have relatively younger stellar age and higher sfr / m@xmath143 than massive galaxies at low to intermediate redshift ( i.e. , ` downsizing ' , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) might not necessarily mean relative scarcity of low - mass galaxies at high redshift .",
    "a significant fraction of old stars in relatively massive ( e.g. , @xmath88m@xmath11 ) galaxies at low redshift could be formed at high redshift in actively star - forming low - mass galaxies which had coalesced into more massive objects through the mergers .",
    "one of the means to address this is to investigate the distribution of the sfr and mean stellar age of galaxies as a function of stellar mass down to low mass at high redshift .",
    "the combination of the distribution of the sfr and mean stellar age as a function of stellar mass and the smf shown in this study allows us to measure the contributions of galaxies in a certain mass range to the cosmic star formation rate density and stellar mass density and their age distribution as a function of redshift .",
    "we will be able to use these quantities in order to estimate what the mass range of high - z galaxies could have assembled into more massive galaxies at later epochs .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the stellar mass function of galaxies at @xmath101 , using the very deep and wide nir imaging data obtained in moircs deep survey and the multi - wavelength public data from the goods .",

    "<S> we use very deep near - infrared ( nir ) imaging data obtained in moircs deep survey ( mods ) to investigate the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function back to @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the mods data reach @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ( 5@xmath4 , vega magnitude ) over 103 arcmin@xmath5 ( wide ) and @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 over 28 arcmin@xmath5 ( deep ) in the goods - north region . </S>",
    "<S> the wide and very deep nir data allow us to measure the number density of galaxies down to low stellar mass ( 10@xmath9 - 10@xmath10m@xmath11 ) even at high redshift with high statistical accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> the normalization of the mass function decreases with redshift and the integrated stellar mass density becomes @xmath12 818% of the local value at @xmath13 and @xmath12 49% at @xmath0 , which are consistent with results of previous studies in general fields . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we found that the low - mass slope becomes steeper with redshift from @xmath14 at @xmath15 to @xmath16 at @xmath17 , and that the evolution of the number density of low - mass ( 10@xmath9 - 10@xmath10m@xmath11 ) galaxies is weaker than that of m@xmath18 ( @xmath1210@xmath19m@xmath11 ) galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the contribution of low - mass galaxies to the total stellar mass density has been significant at high redshift . </S>",
    "<S> the steepening of the low - mass slope with redshift is opposite trend expected from the stellar mass dependence of the specific star formation rate reported in previous studies . </S>",
    "<S> the present result suggests that the hierarchical merging process overwhelmed the effect of the stellar mass growth by star formation and was very important for the stellar mass assembly of these galaxies at @xmath20 . </S>"
