    "the increase in the total hadronic width can be compensated by a smaller value of @xmath99 in @xmath100 than that obtained in the sm fits ; then both @xmath101 and @xmath102 measurements are well described by the @xmath0 mixing model .",

    "<S> proposed explanations of the observed phenomena include supersymmetric@xcite or other new particles@xcite , extra @xmath1 bosons@xcite , technicolor@xcite , and other@xcite models . </S>",
    "<S> our interest here is in possible extra @xmath1 boson interpretations , which have immediate implications for physics at the tevatron . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that @xmath3-channel @xmath4 production and the pair production processes @xmath5 with @xmath19 decays will lead to @xmath6 and @xmath7 events at the tevatron , with a @xmath6 invariant mass peaked at @xmath20 in excess of qcd backgrounds if @xmath21  gev . here </S>",
    "<S> we use @xmath4 to denote the mass eigenstate of the heavy @xmath1 boson after @xmath22 mixing . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath4 interference effects may be observable in @xmath10 at lep1.5 energies .    </S>",
    "<S> our work has a distinct vantage point from other recent @xmath0 analyses of the @xmath12 data that advocate a @xmath0 boson with mass @xmath23  tev@xcite to account for an excess above qcd of the inclusive jet cross section at @xmath24  gev reported by cdf@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although quark distributions are well constrained by deep inelastic scattering data@xcite , a smooth rise in the @xmath25 jet cross section compared to qcd expectations can possibly be explained by other means , such as a modification of the gluon structure function at high @xmath26@xcite or a flattening of @xmath27 at high @xmath28 due to new particles@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> also the cdf high @xmath25 jet anomaly is not present in preliminary d0 data@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a large class of string models with supersymmetry contain additional @xmath29 symmetries and additional exotic matter multiplets . in many of these models </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 and exotic masses are either of @xmath30 or of order @xmath31 to @xmath32  gev@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consequently a search for @xmath0 bosons in the electroweak mass region @xmath33  tev is well motivated . through the mixing of the @xmath0 boson with the @xmath1 , the predictions of electroweak observables are modified@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is natural to see if @xmath34 mixing effects can better account for the precision electroweak measurements . </S>",
    "<S> in general , this mixing affects both lepton and quark partial widths of the @xmath1 as well as the total width . </S>",
    "<S> the changes in the widths vary from model to model because of the different chiral couplings . in the usual models based on grand unification with @xmath35 or @xmath36 gauge groups ( without kinetic mixing@xcite ) , all @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> partial widths are modified . however , because the leptonic widths agree well with sm predictions , an overall fit to the electroweak data is then not significantly improved by @xmath0 mixing in these models and the @xmath37 excess is not explained .    if , however , we consider a model in which the @xmath0 couples solely or dominantly to quarks with a universal strength , a substantial improvement results in the description of the precision electroweak data , as detailed below , and found in other recent analyses@xcite . a reasonable fit to the data </S>",
    "<S> is obtained for a range of universal chiral couplings of the @xmath0 boson . </S>",
    "<S> a gauge symmetry generated by baryon number , @xmath38 , is an interesting possibility@xcite , since this avoids potential problems associated with the breaking of global baryon number by quantum gravity effects ( e.g. , an unacceptable proton decay rate in supersymmetric theories ) . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 has vector couplings . </S>",
    "<S> another possibility is kinetic mixing of the two u(1)s@xcite to suppress the leptonic couplings . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath39 model of @xmath36 is an interesting model in which this may occur@xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> the cancellation of contributions to the @xmath1-leptonic width is fine tuned and leptonic @xmath4 decays may still be present at a suppressed level . in the following , we will consider family - universal couplings to baryon and axial - baryon number . </S>",
    "<S> as in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we assume that the model can be embedded in an anomaly - free theory </S>",
    "<S> . extension of the results to models ( such as @xmath39 ) with different couplings to charge 2/3 and @xmath40 quarks , or to the family non - universal case , is straightforward .    </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath0 coupled to quarks has very interesting implications for physics at the tevatron collider . </S>",
    "<S> if its mass is @xmath41  gev , it could be produced in the @xmath3-channel and in conjunction with the @xmath42 or @xmath43 and detected via its @xmath19 decay mode ( and possibly also through @xmath44 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the signatures for @xmath45 and @xmath46 production would be similar to higgs boson production @xmath47 and @xmath48 , with @xmath49 decays , but the @xmath4 signals could be considerably higher . </S>"
