    "recently , measurements of diffractive jet rates in @xmath1 interactions at the tevatron were observed to be significantly lower than the theoretical expectations ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "the expectations were obtained using parameterizations of diffractive parton distribution functions extracted from @xmath0 interactions at hera .",
    "the discrepancy between the data and the calculations revealed the breakdown of factorization or the onset of absorptive corrections in @xmath1 diffractive events@xcite .",
    "the physical reason for the breakdown of factorization is likely to be related to the different color structure of the probes in @xmath1 and @xmath0 reactions . in @xmath0 , the compact , color singlet @xmath3 pair produced by the virtual photon has a smaller probability of interacting with the external color fields and therefore has a larger rapidity gap survival probability . in @xmath1 ,",
    "the color octet gluon at comparable virtualities still interacts strongly with the external color fields , reducing its rapidity gap survival probability .",
    "the implications of the breakdown of factorization are now studied in nuclear shadowing and dijet production .",
    "nuclear shadowing is defined as the ratio of the @xmath2 to the @xmath4 total cross section , @xmath5 .",

    "[ deltasigma_pa ] , @xmath13 depends upon the @xmath4 diffractive cross section . unlike @xmath14 interactions , @xmath15 can not be directly associated with the shadowing of the structure functions ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "in regge theory , the dominant contribution to the single diffractive cross section at high energy is the triple pomeron term .",
    "the single diffractive cross section can be expressed as @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in these expressions",
    ", @xmath19 represents the coupling of the pomeron to the proton , @xmath20 , and the pomeron intercept @xmath21 , where @xmath22 .",
    "while this form is able to describe the diffractive @xmath0 cross section , it fails to describe the recently observed energy dependence of the diffractive @xmath1 cross section .",
    "a reasonable parameterization of the diffractive @xmath1 cross section is obtained by normalizing @xmath23 according to the following scheme@xcite , @xmath24 where @xmath25 in this scheme , the cross section becomes constant at high energies , @xmath26 .    the effect of using this parameterization on the correction term in eq .",
    "[ deltasigma_pa ] is shown in figure [ delta_sd ] . here , the solid line is a calculation of @xmath27 for @xmath28 with the parameterization , while the dashed line is the nive triple pomeron contribution .",
    "the normalization scheme needed to reproduce @xmath1 data results in a dramatic reduction of the shadowing in @xmath2 .",
