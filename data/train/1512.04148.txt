    "the orion kleinmann - low ( kl ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) region is known as the nearest site of active massive - star formation at a distance of 420  pc @xcite .",
    "there are number of compact sources possibly associated with newly born young stellar objects ( ysos ) .",
    "the most dominant energy source is thought to be a radio source identified as source  i @xcite . because of its extremely high opacity at infrared wavelengths @xcite , observational studies on source",
    "i have been made mainly from centimeter to submillimeter wavelengths .",
    "observations with the very large array ( vla ) at 43  ghz resolve the continuum emission from source  i into a compact structure elongated in northwest - southeast direction with a major axis of @xmath11100  au @xcite .",
    "this emission can be explained by i ) h@xmath12 free - free radiation from optically thick neutral gas at @xmath134500  k heated via mass accretion or ii ) proton - electron free - free emission from compact h region or from an ionized accretion disk with a higher temperature of @xmath118000  k @xcite .",
    "recent studies favor the h@xmath12 free - free radiation scenario @xcite , while a luminosity of source  i required for the dynamical interaction scenario ( see below ) prefers the proton - electron free - free emission @xcite .",
    "future higher resolution observations at higher frequencies are required to decide between the two possibilities .",
    "proper motion measurements of source  i and the bn object , another high - mass yso , with vla have revealed that they are moving away from each other at a relative velocity of @xmath1140  km  s@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "it is proposed that source  i and bn were ejected from a multiple system due to a dynamical interaction that occurred about 500  yrs ago @xcite , and source  i formed a tight binary system with a total mass of 20@xmath14 . at the same time , the dynamical decay released gravitational energy and ejected an explosive wide - angle outflow at an expansion velocity of @xmath15100  km  s@xmath4 traced by the shocked h@xmath0 and [ fe ] lines @xcite , which largely provides the @xmath16 luminosity of the kl nebula .",
    "it powers the strong ( sub)millimeter line emission from the famous `` hot core '' @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", there is an alternative explanation for the origin of the proper motions of this system @xcite , in which the bn object was ejected 4500  yr ago by a dynamic interaction with the @xmath17c system in the trapezium cluster rather than that with source  i. therefore , such a dynamical interaction scenario is still a matter of debate .",
    "source  i is also known as a driving source of another bipolar outflow along the northeast - southwest direction .",
    "the inner most part of the outflow at 10 - 100  au scales is traced by vibrationally excited ( @xmath18=1 , 2 ) sio masers @xcite . source  i has been recognized as one of three rare ysos displaying vibrationally excited sio masers @xcite , suggesting a very large luminosity of @xmath1510@xmath19 , as expected for late - type stars associated with sio masers @xcite .",
    "vlbi observations have revealed that the vibrationally excited sio masers at 43  ghz ( @xmath20=1 - 0 ) trace the limb of an expanding , rotating disk see edge - on that appears to be the base of a magnetically driven disk wind @xcite .",
    "they show a velocity gradient perpendicular to the outflow suggesting a rotating structure with an enclosed mass of @xmath117 - 8@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "this value is roughly consistent with that inferred from infrared spectroscopy of source  i , which suggests a 10@xmath14 protostar with a circumstellar disk @xcite , while it is significantly lower than that proposed by the dynamical interaction scenario , a 20@xmath14 binary @xcite .",
    "the smaller mass estimates may provide a lower limit , if there is non - gravitational support such as radiation pressure and magnetic forces @xcite .    outside the vibrationally excited sio maser distribution , the outflow can be traced by ground vibrational state ( @xmath18=0 ) sio masers and 22  ghz h@xmath0o masers on scales of 100 - 1000  au @xcite .",
    "proper motion measurements of these maser features provide a 3-dimensional velocity field for the outflow with an expansion speed of @xmath1118  km  s@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this northeast - southwest outflow is sometimes called low - velocity ( 18  km  s@xmath4 ) outflow .",
    "the outflow lobes continue to extend to larger than 1000  au scales , traced by thermal sio emission @xcite interacting with the ambient gas .",
    "recent observations with the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) have detected submillimeter h@xmath0o lines at 321  ghz ( @xmath21-@xmath22 ) and 336  ghz ( @xmath1=1 , 5@xmath23-@xmath24 ) toward source  i @xcite .",
    "maps of both these lines show velocities that are consistent with those of the sio masers , i.e. , a velocity gradient perpendicular to the bipolar outflow as seen in the sio maser distributions .",
    "while the 321  ghz line emission is elongated along the bipolar outflow , the 336  ghz vibrationally excited line emission is unresolved with the alma beam size of 0.4 .",
    "the velocity centroid map of the 336  ghz line is consistent with an origin in an edge - on rotating disk described above , i.e. a diameter of 0.2  ( 84  au ) and an enclosed mass of @xmath157@xmath14",
    ". the spectral profile of the 336  ghz line can be explained with an excitation temperature of @xmath153000  k , which is consistent with its lower state energy , @xmath25 , of 2939  k. thus , the 336  ghz line is consistent with thermal excitation , whereas the 321  ghz line could be a maser @xcite",

    "although the spatial and velocity structure of the 232  ghz line was not resolved , due to its insufficient spatial resolution , detection of the high energy h@xmath0o transition would imply evidence for a hot molecular gas component very close to the protostar candidate source  i @xcite .",
    "the results discussed above demonstrate that the submillimeter h@xmath0o lines at high excitation energy can play complementary roles to various sio thermal and maser lines and the 22  ghz h@xmath0o maser , providing physical and dynamical properties of the hot molecular gas associated with newly born ysos on a scale of @xmath11100  au . however , the physical properties and dynamical structure of the h@xmath0o emission region have not been fully understood yet , owing to the limited amount high resolution data @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we report alma observations of the vibrationally excited h@xmath0o line at 658  ghz toward orion  kl source  i. the 658  ghz h@xmath0o line is the lowest rotational transition at the first vibrationally excited state of the ortho h@xmath0o ( @xmath1=1 , 1@xmath2 - 1@xmath3 ) , with a lower state energy level of @xmath25=2329  k @xcite .",

    "however , it is not seen toward the star - forming regions w49n and w51 irs2 @xcite , in spite of their extremely strong 22  ghz h@xmath0o maser emissions . the 658  ghz h@xmath0o line was identified in a single - dish line survey toward the orion  kl with the cso 10.4  m telescope @xcite .",
    "however , its position and source size could not be determined , because of the large beam size of the single - dish telescope @xmath1110 .",

    "* ) will greatly contribute to our understanding of the structure and dynamics of disk / outflow systems associated with this highly interesting object .",
    "observations with alma at band 9 were carried out during cycle 0 at five epochs ( ads / jao.alma#2011.00199.s ) . among them , we selected the aug . 25 , 2012 observation for analysis in the present paper , as it contained the most antennas , longeset baselines , and most on - source time .",
    "total on - source time was 350  seconds , consisting of 6 scans of 30 or 72  seconds every 10  minutes , and the maximum baseline length was 385  m ( 845  k@xmath28 ) .",

    "two other spws at 640.6  ghz and 662.2  ghz were used for continuum emission . the spectral resolution and number of spectral channels",

    "part of the data plotting and image analysis were made by using the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) package .",
    "we used the calibrated visibility data delivered by the east asia alma regional center ( ea - arc ) to make synthesized images .",
    "we first conducted doppler tracking with the casa task , setting the rest frequency to 658.006550  ghz .",
    "next we identified line - free channels and subtracted the continuum emission from the calibrated visibility data using the casa task .",
    "self - calibration was done for the peak channel of the h@xmath0o line at the lsr ( local standard of rest ) velocity of 13.0  km  s@xmath4 with the casa task and .",
    "first we solved only for phase solutions , with a short integration time of 5 seconds .",
    "we then self - calibrated the data with longer integration times ( 30 or 72 seconds ) and solved for both phase and amplitude solutions .",

    "the synthesized beam size was 0.28@xmath50.25  at a position angle of -64  degrees using natural weighting .",
    "because the baseline length ranged from 21 - 385  m ( 45 - 845  k@xmath28 ) , extended structures of @xmath155  are resolved out .    applying the self - calibration solutions to all of the spectral channels and spws",

    "the moment 0 and 1 maps were made using the casa task ( figure [ fig - map ] ) .    by using the line - free channels , we also made a synthesis image of the continuum emission of this region .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig - fov](b ) , we detected source i and some other compact sources possibly corresponding to the main dust ridge , compact ridge , and other compact radio / infrared sources @xcite .",
    "interpretation is not straightforward as our image can retrieve only a small fraction of the total ( large scale ) continuum emission which is `` resolved out '' by alma .",
    "this also produces imaging artifacts .",
    "a brief summary of the continuum emission is given in section [ sec - cont ] , although detailed discussion is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "here we discuss the flux density scale and its uncertainty caused by two major factors .",
    "firstly , we estimate the flux scale affected by the primary beam correction . the target source , source  i is located outside the fwhm of the primary beam of the alma 12  m antenna of 9.4   as described above .",
    "the position offset is ( 5.8 , 5.9 ) northeast of the tracking center position .",
    "if we consider a possible pointing error of 0.6  as described in the alma cycle 0 technical handbook , the primary beam correction factor for source  i is estimated to be 8.6@xmath30 .",
    "thus , the flux uncertainty is @xmath1140% .",
    "next , we consider other sources of uncertainty in the absolute flux calibration .",
    "we find that a flux density variation of the gain calibrator j0607 - 085 among four spws range from 0.64  jy to 1.51  jy in this epoch .",
    "the mean and standard deviation of the flux density of j0607 - 085 are 1.12  jy and 0.36  jy , respectively , suggesting that an additional flux calibration error of 30% . this value is larger than the absolute flux calibration accuracy presented in the alma cycle 0 technical handbook of 20% .",
    "we find less flux density variation in another epoch on july 17 ranging from 0.61 to 0.66 jy , although these data are not employed in this paper .",
    "their mean and standard deviation are 0.63  jy and 0.02  jy , respectively .",
    "this value is consistent with that of the lowest value for one of the spws in aug .",
    "25 of 0.64  jy . because the spw including the 658  ghz h@xmath0o line shows the highest flux density of 1.51  jy on aug .",
    "25 , the flux calibration for the 658  ghz h@xmath0o line could be overestimated by a factor of 2.4 on aug .",
    "the possible flux calibration error at 658  ghz could be affected by the larger atmospheric opacity close to the 658  ghz h@xmath0o line and/or the 656  ghz o@xmath31 line @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we employ the absolute flux density of j0607 - 085 to be 0.64  jy .",
    "we correct this spw - to - spw flux variation for the 658  ghz line by a factor of 0.64/1.51=0.42 .",
    "this may underestimate the flux density of the 658  ghz h@xmath0o line by a factor of 0.42 at maximum if the actual flux density of j0607 - 085 is 1.51  jy .    in summary ,",
    "the total flux calibration uncertainty is @xmath1150% for both of the 658  ghz h@xmath0o line and continuum data , while the absolute flux scale of the 658  ghz line could be underestimated by a factor of 0.42 .",
    "we measured the position of source  i using the band 9 continuum map ( figure [ fig - fov ] ) by fitting a single gaussian with the casa task .",
    "the measured position of source  i is listed in table [ tab - position ] . a typical formal error in the gaussian fitting is 5  mas as indicated in the table [ tab - position ] .",
    "we note that this does not include a systematic error term for the absolute astrometry . for comparison",
    ", we also list the predicted position of source  i based on accurate absolute astrometry of the vla 43  ghz data @xcite .",
    "the errors for the vla data in table [ tab - position ] include those of proper motion and absolute positional accuracy of @xmath115  mas @xcite .",
    "we find that the position offset of the band 9 continuum relative to the vla 43  ghz data are 40  mas and 20  mas in right ascension and declination , respectively .",
    "these values could be the absolute position uncertainty in the continuum observations of source  i at alma band 9 .",
    "possible source of astrometric error include a contribution from poorly imaged ( see above ) extended structure of the hot core and main dust ridge @xcite , uncertainties in primary beam attenuation of the images , and calibration errors .",
    "as discussed above , we applied the phase and amplitude calibration solutions to all spws .",
    "this allows us to register the 658  ghz h@xmath0o map and that of the band 9 continuum emission .",
    "thus , the error in the relative positions between the 658  ghz h@xmath0o line and band 9 continuum should be determined by the signal - to - noise ratio and the beam size . as listed in table",
    "[ tab - position ] , the relative positional error of the alma band 9 continuum and the moment 0 map of the 658  ghz h@xmath0o line is 7  mas , obtained from the formal errors in the gaussian fitting .    for each velocity channel map of the 658  ghz h@xmath0o line emission , we performed a two dimensional gaussian fit to determine peak positions using the aips task sad ( e.g. figure [ fig - centroid](a ) ) . at the peak velocity channel of the 658  ghz h@xmath0o line , the signal - to - noise ratio is @xmath11100 , and hence , the positional precision is estimated to be @xmath110.002 .",
    "errors in the gaussian fitting which range from 0.001  to 0.05  ( 1@xmath29 ) with the typical value of 0.01  are consistent with this estimate .",
    "because some of the channel maps clearly show spatial structure indicative of multiple components and/or structure larger than the beam size of @xmath110.26 , a single gaussian model may result in larger positional uncertainties .    in summary , the absolute position uncertainty of source",
    "i in the present alma band 9 continuum observations is @xmath1150  mas , and the relative positional errors between the band 9 continuum and h@xmath0o lines are 1 - 50  mas depending on the source structure and signal - to - noise ratio .",

    "the brightness temperature of the 658  ghz h@xmath0o line is calculated to be 2@xmath510@xmath6  k or higher , as the emission region is unresolved with the alma beam .",
    "even this value may be underestimated by a factor of @xmath34 as discussed in section [ sec - flux ] .",
    "the observed high brightness temperature implies that maser action as a possible emission mechanism for the 658  ghz h@xmath0o line .",
    "the 658  ghz h@xmath0o line has been detected by the 10.4  m single - dish telescope of the cso @xcite with the beam size of 10 .",
    "the main - beam brightness temperature of the cso observation is @xmath35=8.9  k corresponding to the total flux denity of 300  jy .",
    "this value is smller than our alma results by a factor of 3 .",
    "the difference could be explained neither by the calibration error ( @xmath1150% ) and pointing offset of the cso data nor the calibration uncertainty of the alma data .",
    "it may suggest a flux variation of the 658  ghz h@xmath0o maser line , although further accurate flux monitoring with alma are still necessary to confirm this hypothesis .    for comparison",
    ", we also present the other h@xmath0o lines detected with previous alma observations @xcite in figure [ fig - sp ] .",
    "double - peaked spectral profiles showing brighter red - shifted component are common for all lines , except the 336  ghz line which shows a symmetric line profile . nevertheless , the peak velocities of these double - peaked components are almost the same for all the lines .",
    "these double - peaked structures are also consistent with those of various sio maser lines detected with the vla @xcite , as shown in figure [ fig - sp ] .",
    "the observed line profiles , along with the similar distribution of the h@xmath0o lines at 232  ghz , 321  ghz , and 658  ghz , support the idea that these lines are emitted under similar excitation conditions .    o lines .",

    "the systemic velocity of source  i is @xmath32=5  km  s@xmath4 , as indicated by a vertical dashed line . , width=264 ]      based on the spatial structure and spectral profiles , it is most likely that the 658  ghz h@xmath0o line is associated with the base of the outflow as revealed by vlbi observations of sio masers @xcite and the 321  ghz h@xmath0o maser line @xcite .",
    "the brightness temperature of the 658  ghz h@xmath0o line , @xmath152@xmath510@xmath6  k , would indicate that the line is emitted via maser action .",
    "in contrast , the 336  ghz h@xmath0o line shows a different distribution ( figure [ fig - centroid](c ) ) and a spectral profile with symmetric double - peaks ( figure [ fig - sp ] ) .",
    "as discussed in @xcite and @xcite , the 336  ghz h@xmath0o line could be a thermal line and trace the edge - on disk , unlike emission from the other transitions at 232  ghz , 321  ghz , and 658  ghz .",
    "we note that @xcite the 336  ghz h@xmath0o line toward the red supergiant vy  cma also favor a thermal nature for this line s excitation .",
    "recently , theoretical model calculations for the excitation of the 658  ghz h@xmath0o line have been presented @xcite for the red supergiant vy  cma and for asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars .",
    "the 658  ghz h@xmath0o maser is predicted to be pumped efficiently for an h@xmath0 densities of 10@xmath36 - 10@xmath37  @xmath38 , a fractional h@xmath0o abundance of 10@xmath39 - 10@xmath40 , and gas temperatures of 1000 - 1500  k @xcite .",
    "although the physical and chemical properties of the 658  ghz h@xmath0o maser emitting region associated with source  i would be expected to be different from that of a late - type star , these parameters are roughly consistent with those for the disk - outflow system of source  i associated with sio masers and other submillimeter h@xmath0o lines @xcite .",
    "we note that our alma observation was done during an active phase of the 22  ghz h@xmath0o maser burst in orion  kl , called a `` supermaser '' @xcite .",
    "the 22  ghz supermaser is located at the phase tracking center of the alma observation , corresponding to the compact ridge region @xcite .",
    "while the total flux density of the 22  ghz h@xmath0o supermaser was decreasing on august 25 , 2012 , it was still @xmath41  jy @xcite . in spite of the extremely high flux density of this maser , there was no significant emission of the 658  ghz h@xmath0o line in the compact ridge region in our alma data with the 1@xmath29 noise level of 2  jy  beam@xmath4 in the relevant region . thus , the 658  ghz h@xmath0o line is not related to the 22  ghz supermaser phenomenon , as has also been reported for other transition at 321  ghz and 336  ghz @xcite .",
    "to measure the position of the 658  ghz h@xmath0o emission , we also made a map of the alma band 9 continuum by applying the self - calibration solutions .",
    "continuum emission is detected at the position of source  i , although it is outside the primary beam of the 12  m antenna . the flux density and the peak intensity",
    "are derived from gaussian fitting , 1.04@xmath330.04  jy and 0.77@xmath330.03  jy  beam@xmath4 , respectively ( figure [ fig - fov](b ) ) .",
    "if we correct the primary beam attenuation by a factor of 8.6 , the absolute flux density is calculated to be 8.9  jy , with an uncertainty of 50% .",
    "this value is slightly larger than that of the sma observation at 690  ghz , 6.7@xmath333.2  jy @xcite , but within the mutual errors .",
    "the apparent source size is almost comparable to the beam size as listed in table [ tab - position ] , and hence , the continuum emission of source  i is unresolved with our alma observation . due to the large ( @xmath1150% ) flux uncertainty of source",
    "i ( which is outside the primary beam ) , the limited field of view , and insufficient image quality in particular for spatially extended components , we will not discuss detailed properties of the continuum emission of source  i.",
    "by using alma cycle 0 data , we detect the 658  ghz h@xmath0o line toward the massive protostar candidate source  i in the orion kl region .",
    "the 658  ghz h@xmath0o line is emitted from a compact structure with the size of @xmath11100  au .",
    "the source structure is elongated along the northeast - southwest direction parallel to the low - velocity ( 18  km  s@xmath4 ) molecular outflow .",
    "a velocity gradient can be seen along the northwest - southeast direction , which is perpendicular to the outflow axis and the source elongation .",
    "the spectral profile represents a double - peaked structure , similar to the other millimeter / submillimeter h@xmath0o lines at 232  ghz and 321  ghz lines @xcite .",
    "the high brightness temperature of @xmath152@xmath510@xmath6  k is consistent with maser emission .",
    "these basic properties would suggest that the 658  ghz h@xmath0o line is emitted from the base of the northeast - southwest low - velocity ( 18  km  s@xmath4 ) molecular outflow .",
    "further multi - transition studies of the h@xmath0o lines with alma at higher spatial resolution should provide information about the excitation mechanism and physical properties of the millimeter and submillimeter h@xmath0o line emissions .",
    "they will be powerful tools to investigate dynamics , physics and chemistry in outflow launching regions associated with accretion disks around massive ysos , which is a key issue to understand formation mechanisms of massive ysos .",
