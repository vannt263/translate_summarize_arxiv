    "inflationary cosmology@xcite is the most strong candidate to explain the isotropic , homogeneous and flatness nature of the universe on cosmological scales .",
    "this fact is supported by experimental evidence@xcite . in particular , the model of fresh inflation@xcite attempts to build a bridge between the standard and warm inflationary models and hence can be viewed as an unification of both , chaotic and warm inflation scenarios . in this model",
    "the universe begins from an unstable primordial matter field perturbation with energy density nearly @xmath1 and chaotic initial conditions to later describing a second order phase transition with heating and particles production .",
    "hence , radiation energy density grows during fresh inflation because the yukawa interaction between the inflaton field and other fields in a thermal bath lead to dissipation which is responsible for the slow rolling of the inflaton field though the minimum energetic configuration .",
    "hence , slow - roll conditions are physically justified and there are not a requirement of a nearly flat potential in fresh inflation . as a consequence of the strong dissipation produced by the yukawa interaction @xmath2 ) , there is no oscillation of the inflaton field around the minimum of the effective potential@xcite .",
    "a very interesting issue to study is the natural exit of fresh inflation to a radiation dominated epoch . in this work",
    "we examine this topic in the framework of a scalar field which is coupled to gravity though a coupling @xmath3 . in this context",
    "one can see that for @xmath0 radiation dominance becomes possible when the scalar field @xmath4 approaches to the minimum energetic configuration .",
    "the system is considered though a lagrangian density of an inflaton field which is coupled to the scalar curvature @xmath5 , plus a self - interaction lagrangian @xmath6 , which describes the self - interaction of the inflaton field@xcite @xmath7,\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the gravitational constant , @xmath9 is the planckian mass . during fresh inflation @xmath10 , but at the end of fresh inflation it can hold to values close to @xmath0 . in this paper",
    "we are interested to study this particular case .",
    "we shall consider a 4d friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric with a line element given by @xmath11 , such that @xmath12 .",

    "this parameter is very small : @xmath24 , but at the end of inflation it reaches values close to @xmath25 , so that , for couplings close @xmath26 , inflation ends in a radiation dominated era with @xmath27 . from the inequalities in eq .",

    "the effective potential is described by @xmath37 , such that @xmath38 where the effective squared mass @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath34 is the number of created particles due to the interaction of @xmath4 with the particles in the thermal bath @xmath41 during the fresh inflationary epoch @xmath42 , so that @xmath18 increases with the time .",
    "therefore , the number of particles created is increased dramatically because @xmath43 , but the temperature @xmath44 increases with time .",
    "this means that the ratio @xmath45 will be increased as fresh inflation evolves .",
    "the dynamics of the background scalar field @xmath47 and the fluctuations @xmath46 are described respectively by the equations @xmath48",

    "since the decay width of the produced particles grows with time , when the inflaton approaches the minimum of the potential , there is no oscillation of @xmath4 around the minimum energetic configuration due to at the end of fresh inflation dissipation is dominant with respect to rate of expansion of the universe : ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "hence , the reheating period avoids fresh inflation ) . at the end of fresh inflation",
    "one would expect that the universe becomes radiation dominated .    to examine this possibility we consider the case with @xmath57 , such that the inflaton field is coupled to gravity with @xmath0",
    ". this will be possible at the end of fresh inflation when @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "hence the equation ( [ 7 ] ) holds @xmath60 for a number of degrees of freedom for relativistic particles of the order of @xmath61 one obtains that the temperature reaches values like @xmath62 which is a value very close to the gut - temperature value and corresponds to a radiation energy density @xmath63 .",
    "the effective friction parameter at this moment will be @xmath64 , which can take the value @xmath65 after it , the radiation energy density begins to decrease as @xmath66 and so that @xmath67 decreases in a such manner that the temperature decreases as @xmath68 , which is that one expects in a radiation dominated universe . at this epoch",
    "the effective equation of motion ( [ mod ] ) for the modes is @xmath69 when we have made use of the fact that @xmath70 .",
    "the general solution for this equation is @xmath71 + c_2 \\ , \\textsc{w}\\left[\\frac{k^2 t^2_0}{2 m_p } , \\frac{1}{2 } , 2 m_p t\\right],\\ ] ] where ( @xmath72 ) are the whittaker functions . in the uv sector of the spectrum",
    "the modes are stable . however , for @xmath73 the this modes are unstable and the dominant part of the solution ( [ sol ] ) is @xmath74 .\\ ] ] however , notice that the modes @xmath75 increase at early radiation times , but after it decay to zero with time without crossing the hubble horizon .",
    "it can be seen in the figure ( [ fig1 ] ) for the values @xmath76 .",
    "reheating is not a minor phase at the end of standard inflation .",
    "standard inflation may cause the monopole and domain wall nonthermal symmetry restoration@xcite , which could give a very inhomogeneous universe that disagree with observation .",
    "this last possibility is actually rather difficult in simple models of reheating with only two fields@xcite .",
    "however , this situation can be solved in the case of multiple fields , relevant for gut models@xcite .",
    "this is the case here studied , where the number of created particles can be justified by means of the self - interaction of the inflaton . as in the case of warm inflation@xcite ,",
    "the main difference between fresh inflation and standard inflation resides in that here there is not oscillation of the inflaton field around the minimum of the potential , due to dissipation is too large at the end of inflation . here",
    ", particles creation becomes during inflation , beginning it at zero temperature .    in this work",
    "we have examined the natural exit from a fresh inflationary scenario to a radiation dominated universe when the inflaton field is coupled to gravity . in the particular case where the coupling constant is @xmath0 it is possible to see that this transition is very natural at the end of inflation in such that manner that the parameter @xmath25 when the inflaton field reaches its minimum energetic configuration . at this moment",
    "all the modes of the inflaton field fluctuations are stable and the background temperature is close to the gut one .",
    "however only oscillate the modes with wavelength below the planckian scale .",
    "the modes which are in the classical limit are all stable but they increase to thereafter go down to zero [ see figure ( [ fig1 ] ) ] .",
    "this is because at this time the inflaton field is strongly coupled to gravity and the modes decay very faster than during inflation due to they are super - damped by friction .",
