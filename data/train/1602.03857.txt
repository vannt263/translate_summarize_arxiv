    "light propagation in a nonlinear dielectric may be used to model various subtle effects involving quantum theory and gravity .",
    "these include lightcone fluctuations  @xcite and the effects of quantum stress tensor expectation values in semiclassical gravity  @xcite .",
    "a fluctuating electric field in a nonlinear material causes fluctuations of the effective speed of light of probe pulses , and is analogous to the effects of spacetime geometry fluctuations on light propagation .",
    "this analogy was developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the source of the fluctuations was a squeezed state of the electromagnetic field , and in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the effects of vacuum fluctuations of the electric field were investigated . in both cases , linear fluctuations of the electric field were treated , which models the lightcone fluctuations produced by active gravitational field fluctuations .",
    "these are the fluctuations of the dynamical degrees of freedom of gravity itself , as opposed to the passive fluctuations of gravity , driven by quantum stress tensor fluctuations .",
    "one of the purposes of the present paper will be to develop a model for passive spacetime geometry fluctuations .",
    "this will involve a study of the fluctuations of the time averaged squared electric field , which is of interest in its own right .",
    "a second purpose of this paper will be a further study of switched fluctuations of quantum fields .",
    "the vacuum fluctuations of quantum field operators are only meaningful if the operators have been averaged in time or in spacetime with a smooth sampling function . in the case of linear fields , such as the electric field",
    ", the associated probability distribution is gaussian .",
    "some effects of the time averaged electric field were discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the latter paper",
    ", it was shown that simple arguments may be used to estimate the one loop qed corrections to potential scattering by electrons .",
    "the fluctuations of quadratic field operators , such as the stress tensor or the squared electric field , are more subtle , and are associated with non - gaussian probability distributions  @xcite .",
    "these distributions typically fall more slowly than a gaussian function , increasing the probability of large fluctuations , and depend sensitively upon the choice of sampling function . it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that the sampling function for vacuum fluctuations in a dielectric can depend upon the geometry of the material .",

    "( [ frac ] ) . as expected , the effect produced by the third order coefficient tends to be smaller than that related to second order nonlinearities .",
    "it may be possible to increase the effects of quadratic fluctuations if new materials with larger third order susceptibilities can be found . in the next section",
    ", we will discuss a different type of enhancement .",
    "in the previous sections , we have been concerned with the variance of the flight time , which is in turn determined by the variance of the sampled electric field or of the squared electric field . here",
    "we wish to estimate the probability of much larger fluctuations than those described by the variance . in the case of effects produced by the second order polarizability",
    ", this probability will be very small , as the probability distribution for fluctuations of the electric field is gaussian , and hence falls very rapidly .",
    "however , flight time variations due to the third order polarizability will be associated with a more slowly decreasing probability distribution .",
    "the distributions for quadratic quantum operators have been discussed in refs .",
    "in particular , the asymptotic form for the probability distribution of the lorentzian average of the squared electric field was given in ref .",
    "the sampling function used in this paper , eq .",
    "( [ fbd ] ) , is not lorentzian , but the magnitude of its fourier transform , eq .",
    "( [ fourier ] ) , has the same exponential decay as in the lorentzian case .",
    "furthermore , it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that the decay rate of the fourier transform of the sampling function determines the asymptotic form for the probability distribution .",
    "thus it is reasonable to extrapolate the lorentzian results to the present case .",
    "here we briefly summarize the needed results from ref .",
    "let @xmath107 be the lorentzian time average of the normal ordered squared electric field operator at a given point in space , or more generally along a timelike worldline . in our problem",
    ", this will be the path of the probe wave packet .",
    "define the dimensionless variable @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the characteristic averaging time .",
    "let @xmath110 be the probability distribution for finding a given value of @xmath8 in a measurement in the vacuum state , which is normalized by @xmath111 here @xmath112 is the lower bound , the smallest value of @xmath8 which could ever be observed .",
    "note that this lower bound is negative , so measurements of @xmath113 in the vacuum state can return negative values , just as expectation values of the squared electric field in more general states can be negative .",
    "in fact , one expects most measurements in the vacuum to result in a negative value , but when the outcome is positive , it is likely to be larger in magnitude .",
    "note that a negative value of @xmath107 results in a time _ advance _ compared to the mean flight time in the material , just as positive values result in time delays .",
    "our primary interest is in the asymptotic form of @xmath110 when @xmath114 , which describes the probability of finding especially large values of the squared electric field .",
    "this asymptotic form is approximately @xmath115 where @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "a striking feature of this result is the one - third power in the exponential , which causes @xmath110 to fall much more slowly than a gaussian or an exponential function .",
    "given @xmath110 , we can define the cumulative probability distribution by @xmath118 which gives the probability of finding any value greater than or equal to @xmath119 in a given measurement .",
    "if @xmath120 , we can directly integrate eq .",
    "( [ eq : p ] ) to find @xmath121    it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the second moment of @xmath110 for the squared electric field is @xmath122 so the root mean square of @xmath8 is @xmath123 .",
    "now we may use eq .",
    "( [ eq : pcumm ] ) to find the probability of a result which exceeds a large multiple of @xmath124 .",
    "some examples are given in table  [ table : probs ] .",
    ".probabilities of large squared electric field fluctuations . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the same probabilities apply to the flight time delay due to vacuum squared electric field fluctuations .",
    "thus there is a probability of about @xmath125 that a given pulse will suffer a delay which is 1000 times larger than the root mean square value , given for example by eq .",
    "( [ si ] ) . note that our discussion is rather heuristic , and these are order of magnitude estimates . in particular",
    ", we have not made a clear distinction between the squared electric field in the rest frame of the probe pulse , and that in the rest frame of the dielectric material .",
    "however , for @xmath126 , so @xmath127 to leading order , these quantities will be of the same order .",
    "another important point is that both the lorentzian function and the function @xmath55 defined in eq .",
    "( [ fbd ] ) have tails in both directions .",
    "a more realistic choice is a function of compact support , which is strictly zero before the measurement process begins .",
    "such functions lead to even slower decrease of the probability distribution for large arguments  @xcite .",

    "our model studies the flight time of a probe pulse through a material with a non - zero third order polarizability .",

    "[ sec : estimates ] .",

    "we have also extended the study of the effects of temporal switching functions on the fluctuations of quadratic quantum operators . in sec .",
    "[ sec : switch ] , we discussed a specific choice of switching function , which can be relatively constant over a finite interval , and can model the density profile of the nonlinear material .",
    "the fourier transform of this function falls exponentially at a rate determined by the parameter @xmath58 , which controls the rate of rise and fall at the ends of the plateau of this function . as this parameter",
    "is decreased , increasingly higher frequency modes contribute and increase the fractional flight time variation .",
    "we were able to use the fourier transform to estimate the range of vacuum modes which contribute to the flight time variation and to test our approximation of ignoring dispersion .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : prob ] , we discussed the probability of especially large fluctuations in flight time",
    ". this analog model may provide a means to study the probability of large stress tensor fluctuations , which tend to fall more slowly than a gaussian function  @xcite .",
    "we estimated , for example , a probability of @xmath129 for finding a flight time delay which is at least @xmath130 times the typical delay .",
