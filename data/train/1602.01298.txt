    "let @xmath0 be a simple graph .",
    "a _ proper coloring of @xmath0 _",
    "( from now on called coloring ) is a function @xmath4 such that @xmath5 whenever @xmath6 .",
    "we say that @xmath7 is a _ b - vertex in @xmath8 ( of color @xmath9 ) _ if for every color @xmath10 , there exists @xmath11 colored with @xmath12 that is adjacent to @xmath13 .",
    "observe that if @xmath8 has a color class @xmath12 that has no b - vertices , then we can separatedly change the color of each vertex in @xmath12 to obtain a proper coloring with fewer colors .",
    "but since the coloring problem is np - complete , this clearly can not always be applied until one reaches a coloring of @xmath0 with @xmath14 colors .",
    "an interesting case of study therefore is to investigate the worst possible scenario .",
    "more formally , irving and manlove  @xcite defined a _",
    "b - coloring _ as a coloring of @xmath0 that has at least one b - vertex in each of its color classes , and the _ b - chromatic number of @xmath0 _ , denoted by @xmath1 , as the maximum number of colors used by a b - coloring of @xmath0 .",
    "they showed that the problem is np - complete in general , but polynomial - time solvable for trees .",
    "after this , the problem has been shown to be np - complete also for bipartite graphs @xcite , chordal graphs @xcite , and line graphs  @xcite .",
    "irving and manlove also observed that the cube has b - colorings with 2 and 4 colors , but not with 3 colors , and in  @xcite the authors show that @xmath15 minus a perfect matching only admits b - colorings with 2 and @xmath16 colors , for every positive integer @xmath16 .",
    "this inspired the following definitions : the _ b - spectrum _ of a graph @xmath0 is the set @xmath17 containing every @xmath2 for which @xmath0 has a b - coloring with @xmath2 colors ; and @xmath0 is called _ b - continuous _ if @xmath17 contains every integer in the interval @xmath3 $ ] . in  @xcite",
    ", the authors prove that in fact for every finite subset @xmath18 , there exists a graph @xmath0 such that @xmath19 .",
    "they also prove that deciding whether a given graph @xmath0 is b - continuous is an np - complete problem , even if b - colorings with @xmath14 and @xmath20 colors are given .",
    "concerning positive results , we mention that the following graph classes are b - continuous : chordal graphs  @xcite ; kneser graphs @xmath21 for @xmath22  @xcite ; @xmath23-sparse graphs  @xcite and @xmath23-tidy graphs  @xcite ; and regular graphs with girth at least 6 and with no cycles of length 7  @xcite .",
    "the _ girth of @xmath0 _ is the minimum size of a cycle in @xmath0 .",
    "observe that a necessary condition for @xmath0 to have a b - coloring with @xmath2 colors is that @xmath0 also has at least @xmath2 vertices with degree at least @xmath24 , namely the b - vertices in such a b - coloring .",
    "therefore , if @xmath25 is defined as the maximum value for which @xmath0 satisfies this condition , i.e. , @xmath25 is the largest integer @xmath2 such that @xmath0 has at least @xmath2 vertices of degree at least  @xmath24 , then naturally we get @xmath26 .",
    "one can verify that the value @xmath25 can be easily computed given the degree sequence of @xmath0 in non - increasing order . as mentioned before , irving and manlove proved in their seminal paper that finding the b - chromatic number of a tree can be done in polynomial time .",
    "in fact , they prove that if @xmath0 is a tree , then @xmath1 is at least @xmath27 , and one can decide whether @xmath1 equals @xmath25 in polynomial time .",
    "later , it was noted that in fact this property holds for graphs with large girth , and the most recent result regarding this aspect says that @xmath28 holds whenever @xmath0 has girth at least  7  @xcite .",
    "we believe this to be already a good reason for the investigation of the b - continuity of graphs with large girth , but in  @xcite and  @xcite there are further questions concerning the b - chromatic number of graphs with large girth . in  @xcite , the authors conjecture that if @xmath0 belongs to a certain subclass of the bipartite graphs with girth at least  6 , then @xmath28 . although the target subclass is a fairly simple one , up to now the only existing result on their conjecture is given in  @xcite , where the authors prove that their conjecture is a consequece of the famous erds - faber - lovsz conjecture  @xcite . in  @xcite ,",
    "el sahili and kouider ask whether @xmath29 whenever @xmath0 is a @xmath30-regular graph with girth at least  5 .",
    "blidia , maffray and zemir  @xcite answered their question in the negative by showing that the petersen graph does not have this property ; then they conjecture that this is the only exception .",
    "since then , a number of partial results have been given ; for instance  @xcite .",
    "all these results on graphs with large girth indicate that , unlike the classic coloring problem , having large girth somehow helps in finding b - colorings of @xmath0 .",
    "this is why we ask the following question , similar to the one posed in  @xcite .",
    "what is the minimum @xmath31 such that @xmath0 is b - continuous whenever @xmath0 has girth at least @xmath31 ?    in this article , we prove that @xmath32 .",
    "this and the fact that complete bipartite graphs without a perfect matching are not b - continuous  @xcite give us that @xmath33 .",
    "up to our knowledge , no non - b - continuous graph with girth at least  5 is known .",
    "[ main ] if @xmath0 has girth at least 10 , then @xmath0 is b - continuous .    to prove the above theorem",
    ", we first analyse a special case , then we prove that if @xmath0 has a b - coloring with @xmath2 colors and @xmath34 , then either we can construct a b - coloring with @xmath24 colors by applying certain operations , or @xmath0 falls into the special case .",
    "we emphasize that these operations actually hold for girth 6 , i.e. , the stronger hypothesis of the theorem is only necessary to treat the special case .",
    "we mention that in  @xcite , the authors also give a polynomial - time algorithm to compute the b - chromatic number of graphs with girth at least  7 . at the same time , computing the chromatic number of a graph with girth at least @xmath35 is np - complete , for every fixed @xmath36 , even if @xmath0 is a line - graph  @xcite .",
    "therefore , any proof of a result as theorem  [ main ] must have a non - constructive part , as otherwise one can start with an optimal b - colouring of graph @xmath0 , and decrease the number of used colors until one obtains an optimal coloring of @xmath0 .",
    "the non - constructive part of our proof lies in the construction of a b - coloring for the special case .",
    "before we proceed , we need further definitions . given a coloring @xmath8 of @xmath0 with @xmath2 colors , a value @xmath37 in @xmath38 is called a _ color _ , the set @xmath39 is called the _ color class @xmath37 _ , and given a subset @xmath40 , we denote by @xmath41 the set @xmath42 .",
    "we say that a color is _ realized in @xmath8 _ if @xmath39 contains a b - vertex @xmath13 ; we also say that _",
    "@xmath13 realizes color @xmath37_. if @xmath8 is a coloring of @xmath0 with @xmath2 colors and @xmath43 is such that @xmath37 is not realized in @xmath8 , then a coloring of @xmath0 with @xmath24 colors can be obtained by changing the color of each @xmath44 to some @xmath45)$ ] ; we say that the new coloring is obtained from @xmath8 by _ cleaning color @xmath37_. the _ distance _ between vertices @xmath13 and @xmath11 in @xmath0 is given by the minimum number of edges in a path between @xmath13 and @xmath11 in @xmath0 ; if @xmath13 and @xmath11 are in distinct components of @xmath0 , we say that their distance is @xmath46 .",
    "given @xmath7 , we denote by @xmath47 the set of vertices at distance exactly @xmath37 from @xmath13 , and by @xmath48 the set @xmath49 .",
    "finally , we say that @xmath7 is _ @xmath2-dense _",
    "if @xmath50 , and we denote the set of @xmath2-dense vertices of @xmath0 by @xmath51 .",
    "let @xmath0 be any graph .",
    "we say that @xmath7 is a _",
    "@xmath2-iris _ in @xmath0 if there exists @xmath52 with cardinality @xmath24 ; and we say that @xmath13 is a _",
    "dilated @xmath2-iris _ if there exists a subset @xmath53 with @xmath2 vertices such that @xmath54 , for every @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "observe that if @xmath13 is a @xmath2-iris or a dilated @xmath2-iris , then @xmath57 .",
    "let @xmath13 be a ( dilated ) @xmath2-iris and @xmath58 be the induced subgraph @xmath59 $ ] .",
    "roughly , the idea of the proof is to construct a b - coloring of @xmath58 with @xmath2 colors , then use color 1 to color @xmath60 , and color the remaining vertices with @xmath61 , which is possible as long as @xmath62 . in  @xcite , the authors prove that if @xmath0 is a regular graph with girth at least  6 and containing no cycles of length  7 , then @xmath0 is b - continuous . for this , they show that , for any integer @xmath2 in the interval @xmath3 $ ] , a b - coloring with @xmath2 colors can be obtained .",
    "their proof actually holds whenever @xmath0 has a @xmath2-iris , as can be seen in the next lemma .",
    "we present their proof for completeness sake , since our notation differs from theirs .",
    "[ lem : iris ] let @xmath0 be a graph with girth at least 6 and with no cycles of length  7 .",
    "if @xmath0 has a @xmath2-iris and @xmath63 , then @xmath0 has a b - coloring with @xmath2 colors .    if @xmath64 , then every @xmath2-coloring of @xmath0 is also a b - coloring of @xmath0",
    "; hence , suppose that @xmath62 .",
    "let @xmath7 be a @xmath2-iris , and let @xmath65 .    start by coloring @xmath13 with 1 and @xmath66 with @xmath37 , for each @xmath67 .",
    "then , for each @xmath68 , color @xmath69 uncolored vertices in @xmath70 with the colors missing in @xmath70 .",
    "note that this can be done because @xmath71 $ ] is a tree .",
    "let @xmath8 be the obtained partial coloring , @xmath72 be the set of colored vertices , and @xmath73 be the set of uncolored vertices in @xmath74 .",
    "note that , because @xmath0 has girth at least 6 and contains no cycles of length 7 , we get that @xmath75 is a stable set .",
    "also , note that @xmath13 is the only vertex colored with @xmath76 in @xmath72 , which means that @xmath77 for every @xmath78 .",
    "hence , we can give color 1 to every vertex in @xmath73 .",
    "finally , note that @xmath79 separates @xmath80 from the rest of the graph , which implies that we can use colors @xmath81 to color the remaining vertices .    in order to color the dilated @xmath2-iris",
    ", we use a similar approach .",
    "however , because some of the vertices of @xmath82 , which are the vertices that we want to turn into b - vertices , are at distance  2 from @xmath13 , we need a stronger restriction on the girth of @xmath0 in order to have the `` barrier '' of vertices colored with color  1 .",
    "[ lem : dilatediris ] let @xmath0 be a graph with girth at least  10 . if @xmath0 has a dilated @xmath2-iris and @xmath63 , then @xmath0 has a b - coloring with @xmath2 colors .",
    "again , we can suppose that @xmath62 .",
    "let @xmath7 be a dilated @xmath2-iris , and let @xmath83 satisfying the conditions of the definition .",
    "we can suppose that @xmath84 as otherwise @xmath13 is also a @xmath2-iris and the lemma follows by lemma  [ lem : iris ] .",
    "so suppose , without loss of generality , that @xmath85 and @xmath86 . also , for each @xmath87 , let @xmath88 , and denote by @xmath89 the set @xmath90 .",
    "start by coloring @xmath13 with @xmath91 , @xmath66 with @xmath37 , for each @xmath92 , and @xmath93 with @xmath76 , for each @xmath94 .",
    "let @xmath95 and consider @xmath96 and @xmath97 . because @xmath0 has girth at least 10 and @xmath98",
    ", we get : @xmath66 is the only neighbor of @xmath99 in @xmath100 ( the same for @xmath101 and @xmath102 ) ; and @xmath103 .",
    "therefore , for each @xmath43 , we can easily color @xmath69 neighbors of @xmath66 in such a way as to turn @xmath66 into a b - vertex .",
    "now , denote by @xmath104 be the set of colored vertices , by @xmath105 the set of vertices colored with @xmath76 , and by @xmath73 the set of uncolored vertices in @xmath106 .",
    "note that @xmath107 ; therefore , if @xmath99 and @xmath101 are distinct vertices in @xmath108 , then their distance to @xmath13 is at most 4 and , since @xmath0 has girth at least 10 , we get @xmath103 .",
    "this means that @xmath108 is a stable set , in which case we can color each vertex of @xmath73 with color  @xmath76 . finally , by the choice of @xmath73 , we know that @xmath109 separates @xmath110 from the rest of the graph , and since @xmath62",
    ", we can color the remaining vertices with @xmath81    in the next section , we start with a b - coloring of @xmath0 with @xmath111 colors , @xmath112 , and try to obtain a b - coloring of @xmath0 with @xmath2 colors . in the cases we are not able to do that",
    ", we are able to prove that @xmath0 has either a @xmath2-iris or a dilated @xmath2-iris ; the theorem thus follows .",
    "let @xmath8 be any coloring of @xmath0 with @xmath2 colors , and let @xmath113 denote the set of all b - vertices in @xmath8 .",
    "if @xmath8 is a b - coloring and @xmath8 minimizes @xmath114 , we say that @xmath8 is _",
    "minimal_. if under certain conditions we can decrease the number of b - vertices used in a minimal b - coloring @xmath8 , and we can ensure that only b - vertices of a certain color are lost , then we know that the obtained coloring realizes exactly @xmath24 colors .",
    "this means that a b - coloring with @xmath24 colors can be obtained by cleaning the color class that is not realized in @xmath8 .",
    "next , we describe a number of situations where such a coloring can be obtained .",
    "consider @xmath8 to be a minimal b - coloring with @xmath2 colors . in",
    "what follows , we refer only to @xmath8 , so we ommit it from the definitions . for each color",
    "@xmath37 denote by @xmath115 the set of b - vertices in color class @xmath37 , i.e. , @xmath116 . also , for each @xmath117 , let @xmath118 contain each @xmath119 such that @xmath99 is the only neighbor of @xmath120 colored with @xmath121 .",
    "in other words , letting @xmath122 : @xmath123    in the following arguments , we usually change the color of some @xmath117 and want to conclude that @xmath114 decreases , while preserving at least @xmath24 realized colors . for this",
    ", we want to ensure that some @xmath115 disappears , but also that no new b - vertex is created .",
    "the following straightforward proposition is useful .",

    "this proposition ensures that if vertex @xmath99 has its color changed , but nothing else changes in its neighborhood , then @xmath99 does not turn into a b - vertex . however , this can still happen to a neighbor @xmath101 of @xmath99 as the number of colors appearing in @xmath127 may increase .",

    "safe for @xmath99_. this means that changing the color of @xmath99 to @xmath37 does not create new b - vertices .    [ prop : unique ] let @xmath8 be a b - coloring of @xmath0 with @xmath2 colors , @xmath62 .",
    "if @xmath117 is mutable and @xmath131 , then there exists a b - coloring of @xmath0 with @xmath24 colors .",
    "let @xmath132 .",
    "just change the color of @xmath99 to any safe color @xmath133)$ ] , and let @xmath124 be the obtained coloring .",
    "proposition [ prop : nonewbvertex ] clearly applies . also , by the definition of @xmath118 , we know that every @xmath134 is not a b - vertex in @xmath124 since color @xmath121 does not appear in @xmath135 . finally , by the definition of safe color we know that @xmath136 .",
    "therefore , only b - vertices of color @xmath30 are lost , no new b - vertex is created , and because @xmath8 is minimal , we know that there is no remaining b - vertices with color @xmath30 .",
    "thus , the desired b - coloring can be obtained by cleaning color @xmath30 .",
    "now , for each @xmath137 and each color @xmath138 , let @xmath139 , and @xmath140 be the remaining neighbors of @xmath13 colored with @xmath37 , i.e. , @xmath141 . we say that color @xmath37 is _ weak in @xmath142 _ if , for every @xmath143 , @xmath99 is mutable and the following occurs :    1 .   for every @xmath144 ,",
    "there exists @xmath145 that realizes color @xmath146 and such that @xmath147 .",

    "we change the color of each @xmath143 to any safe color @xmath150)$ ] . because @xmath140 is a stable set , proposition [ prop : nonewbvertex ] applies to each @xmath143",

    "now , @xmath13 has no more neighbors of color @xmath37 , which by the minimality of @xmath8 implies that no more b - vertices of color @xmath9 exists .",
    "thus , the desired b - coloring can be obtained by cleaning color @xmath9 .",
    "the next lemma finishes the proof .",
    "let @xmath0 be a graph with girth at least  5 , and @xmath8 be a b - coloring of @xmath0 with @xmath2 colors , @xmath62 .",
    "then either there exists a b - coloring of @xmath0 with @xmath24 colors , or @xmath0 has a @xmath153-iris , or a dilated @xmath153-iris .",

    "so suppose otherwise , and let @xmath156 , for some @xmath157 . if @xmath37 is a weak color in @xmath142 , the lemma follows by proposition [ prop : weak ]",

    "we have proved that graphs with girth at least  10 are b - continuous , giving yet more evidence that being locally acyclic helps at obtaining b - colorings of the graph , contrary to the classical coloring problem .",
    "we mention that the girth  10 condition is needed in only one small part of the proof , namely to color a dilated @xmath2-iris .",
    "however , one can observe that the arguments applied in section  [ sec : decreasing ] concern the vicinity of only one vertex .",
    "this means that when propositions  [ prop : unique ] and  [ prop : weak ] can not be applied , then the graph @xmath0 is a lot more structured , namely that every mutable vertex @xmath99 has @xmath164 , and every b - vertex @xmath13 is the center of either a @xmath153-iris or a dilated @xmath153-iris .",
    "in fact , we believe that even the `` quasi - b - vertices '' ( vertices in the neighborhood of unmutable vertices ) also generate irises . this is why we believe that our result can be generalized for every graph with girth at least  6 and with no cycles of length  7 , which would generalize the result in  @xcite .",
