    "the occurances of gusts represent a great problem affecting a wide field of technical applications as for instance the construction of wind energy converters @xcite as well as the construction of high buildings in general @xcite . but also regarding the landing- and",
    "take - off - operations at airports the importance of the statistics of gusts becomes evident @xcite . nevertheless _",
    "gusts _ are not uniquely defined . in @xcite or @xcite",
    "gusts are taken as an additional structure besides the permanent , fluctuating _ turbulence _ @xmath0 around the mean wind @xmath1 of the wind velocity field",
    ". more often wind gusts are characterized by _",
    "velocity differences during short time intervals ranging typically between some seconds up to a minute . but",
    "these characterisations are still vague . + in order to examine wind gusts in a statistical way we use a data set of a turbulent wind velocity field recorded near the coastline of the northsea at the fh ostfriesland in emden ( germany ) .",
    "the velocity was measured by means of an ultrasonic anemometer at @xmath2 height .",
    "the sampling frequency was @xmath3 .",
    "the measuring period took about one year ( 1997 - 1998 ) .",
    "after careful investigation of the quality of the data we examine a representative 275-hour - excerpt of october 1997 and focus on the velocity component in direction of the mean wind ( see also for a first brief report on the analysis of these data @xcite ) .",
    "+ our main interest is to explore how atmospheric turbulence is related to the well known local isotropic and stationary laboratory one .",
    "therefore we use a simple measure for gusts and compare both velocity fields by means of their probabilistic features .",
    "the laboratory data we use here was recorded in a wind tunnel behind a cylinder with a reynoldsnumber of @xmath4 ( see @xcite ) . in a second step",
    "we examine the waiting time distributions of successive wind gusts to resolve also their time structure .",
    "the wind field is known to exhibit a high degree of turbulence with reynoldsnumbers @xmath5 of about @xmath6 .",
    "the wind velocity @xmath7 is commonly ( see @xcite ) expressed as the sum of the mean velocity @xmath1 and fluctuations @xmath0 around it . for the mean velocity @xmath1 a ten minute average",
    "is used : @xmath8 here we concentrate on the velocity components in the mean velocity direction .",
    "the greater the fluctuation values @xmath9 the more turbulent the wind field becomes . in windenergy research",
    "this is often expressed by the _ turbulence degree _",
    "@xmath10 which is defined as the standard deviation @xmath11 in relation to the mean velocity @xmath12 : @xmath13 nevertheless the value of @xmath10 does not contain any dynamical or time - resolved information about the fluctuation field itself . +    to achieve a deeper understanding of wind gusts  as a result of the fluctuating wind field ",
    "we investigate in how far wind gusts are related to the well known features of small scale turbulence . to this end",
    "we will perform an analogous analysis for our wind data and data from a turbulent wake flow behind a cylinder in a wind tunnel . as a natural and simple measure of wind gusts we use the statistics of _",
    "velocity increments _",
    "@xmath14 of the fluctuations : @xmath15 the increments directly measure the velocity difference after a characteristic time @xmath16 ( illustrated in fig.[trapez ] ) .",
    "so a high increment exceeding a certain threshold @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) can be defined as a gust . + for a statistical analysis we are interested in how frequent a certain increment value occurs and whether this frequency depends on @xmath16 .",
    "therefore we calculate the _ probability density functions _ ( pdfs ) @xmath19 of the increments . in fig .",
    "[ windpdf ] the pdfs for 5 different values of @xmath16 are shown .",
    "these distributions are all characterized by marked fat _ tails _ and a peak around the mean value .",
    "such pdfs are called _ intermittent _ and differ extremely from a gaussian distribution that is commonly considered to be the suitable distribution for continuous random processes .",
    "+    a _ normal distribution _ is uniquely defined by its mean value @xmath20 and its standard deviation @xmath11 .",
    "thus every distribution can be compared to a normal distribution in a quantitative way . in fig .",
    "[ gauss ] we compare one of the measured pdfs ( @xmath21 ) with a gaussian distribution with the same @xmath11 . in this presentation",
    "the different behaviour of the tails of both distributions becomes evident .",
    "note that the high increments of the wind pdfs  located in the tails  correspond to strong gusts .",
    "for instance the value of @xmath22 corresponds to a velocity ascending of @xmath23 during @xmath24 ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ gauss ] the measured probability of our wind data is about @xmath25 times higher than for a gaussian distribution with the same standard deviation ! this case is represented by the arrow in fig .",
    "[ gauss ] .",
    "the value @xmath25  for instance",
    " means that a certain gust which is observed about five times a day should be observed just once in 500 years if the distribution were a gaussian instead of the observed intermittent one . + but intermittent distributions seem to appear quite often in natural or economical systems like in earthquake-(@xcite ) , foreign exchange market- ( @xcite ) or even in some traffic - statistics ( @xcite ) .",
    "what kind of statistics do we get in the case of local isotropic and stationary laboratory experiments ? the typical probability density functions in laboratory turbulence  as shown in fig .",
    "[ vergleich ]  change from intermittent ones for small values of @xmath16 to rather gaussian shaped distributions with increasing @xmath16 .",
    "when @xmath26 with @xmath27 being the _ correlation time _ ( integral time ) the approach to a normal distribution is marked : @xmath28 @xmath29 is the correlation function of the fluctuations . in our case",
    "the correlation time of the atmospheric flow is @xmath30 and @xmath31 for the laboratory data @xcite .",
    "+ note that for the pdfs of the atmospheric velocity field this characteristic change of shape , even for @xmath16-values higher than @xmath27 ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ windpdf ] ) is not observed .",
    "+    as already mentioned a fundamental difference between atmospheric and laboratory turbulence is that the latter is stationary . in laboratory experiments",
    "one usually deals with a fixed value and direction of the mean wind speed @xmath12 , which is obviously never the case for atmospheric wind fields .",
    "therefore in a second step we calculate the pdfs of the atmospheric increments only for certain mean velocity intervals .",
    "that means that only those increments are taken into account with @xmath12 ranging in a narrow velocity interval with a width of typically @xmath32 .",
    "these _ conditioned _ pdfs @xmath33 show a similar qualitative change of shape like those of the laboratory experiment ( @xmath34 ) this change of shape is not observed . ]",
    "which is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ vergleich ] b ) .",
    "+ to quantify this similarity we use a well established fit by an empirical explicite function for the pdf .",
    "this formula was derived in @xcite on the basis of kolmogorov s understanding of a turbulent cascade : @xmath35    in fig .",
    "[ windpdf ] and [ vergleich ] these fitfunctions are represented by the solid lines .",
    "@xmath36 is the fundamental parameter ( _ formparameter _ ) in equation ( [ c7 ] ) and determines the shape of the probability distribution . as it can easily be seen equation ( [ c7 ] ) reduces to a gaussian distribution if @xmath36 is zero : @xmath37 + on the other hand the more @xmath36 increases the more intermittent the distributions become . in this way",
    "the parameter @xmath36 may serve to compare the pdfs with each other in a more quantitative way . in fig .",
    "[ lama ] the evolution of the formparameter as a function of the increment distance @xmath16 is shown .",
    "+ other laboratory measurements ( see @xcite ) of @xmath36 have shown evidence that it saturates approximately at @xmath38 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ lama ] the formparameter of the conditioned wind increments as well as of the laboratory ones is approximately @xmath38 for small @xmath39values .",
    "furthermore it tends to zero with increasing @xmath16 .",
    "none of these two features is observed in the case of the unconditioned increments , @xmath36 is rather independent from @xmath16 with a value of about @xmath40 .",
    "a constant behaviour of @xmath36 means that the form of the pdfs remain unchanged , while its variance may change . together with the power law scaling of @xmath41",
    "we get the unusual result , that for pdfs with constant intermittent shapes the scaling of the n - th moments @xmath42 follow the proposed law of kolmogorov 41@xcite , @xmath43 , i.e. without intermittency corrections for the exponents .",
    "+ thus we have shown that the anomalous statistics of wind fluctuations on discrete time intervals  which are obviously related to wind gusts  can be reduced to the well known intermittent ( anomalous ) statistics of local isotropic turbulence .",
    "this result deviates from results of wind data reported in @xcite , where it is claimed that their unconditioned wind pdfs behave like stationary ones from laboratory measurements .",
    "thus on the basis of our stochastic analysis we claim that wind gusts are no independent structures but are a part of small scale turbulence .",
    "so far we have shown how the atmospheric turbulence is related to the laboratory one in a statistical way .",
    "this probabalistic ansatz describes the frequency with which certain gusts occur but it is not clear how they are distributed in time . in this sense we now examine the inter - event - times between successive wind gusts .",
    "+ the marked fat tail behaviour of the unconditioned pdfs  as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ windpdf ] a )  points at an interesting effect . in @xcite the equivalence between the divergence of the moments @xmath44 and the hyperbolic ( intermittent ) form of pdfs which leads to a power law behaviour of the probability distribution",
    "is emphasized : @xmath45 a famous example of such a natural power law behaviour is the _ gutenberg - richter - law _ @xcite that describes the frequency n of earthquakes with a magnitude being greater than a certain threshold m ( magnitude ) : @xmath46 @xmath47 describes the number of occurances of those earthquakes with an energy output higher than a threshold @xmath48 .",
    "the magnitude m is proportional to the logarithm of @xmath49 .",
    "the same result is found for the energy flux distribution of a wind field @xcite .",
    "but also the waiting time distribution of fore- and after shocks obey a power - law , what is known as the _ omori - law _ @xcite .",
    "+ in this sense we now examine the waiting time distribution of wind gusts .",
    "therefore we refer to the idealized gust represented in fig .",
    "[ trapez ] choosing different thresholds @xmath50 and different increment distances @xmath16 ( see eq .",
    "[ increments ] ) .",
    "always when the condition @xmath51 is fulfilled a gust event is registered . to avoid that one event is counted several times we use the condition that the distance between two successive events @xmath52 is at least @xmath16 . due to the cumulation of occurances for small time distances",
    "we choose a logarithmic time .",
    "+ the distributions for @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( about ten seconds ) and for @xmath55 and @xmath56 are shown in fig .",
    "[ wtime ] a ) respectively [ wtime ] b ) .",
    "it can easily be seen that the exponential fit in fig .",
    "[ wtime ] corresponds to a power law concerning the waiting times @xmath52 .",
    "only the exponent seems to depend on @xmath50 and @xmath16 .",
    "+ considering @xmath57 and the normalisation @xmath58 the used fitfunction @xmath59 can also be written as a function of @xmath52 which leads to a power - law : @xmath60 this power law behaviour of the waiting time distributions is only observed for the atmospheric wind data and not for the stationary laboratory one .",
    "on the basis of well defined velocity increments an analogous analysis of measured wind data and measured data from a turbulent wake was performed .",
    "the statistics of velocity increments , as a related statistics to the occurance frequency of wind gusts , showed that they are highly intermittent .",
    "these anomalous ( not gaussian distributed ) statistics explain an increased high probability of finding strong gusts .",
    "this could be set in analogy with turbulence measurements of an idealized , local isotropic laboratory flow if a proper condition on a mean wind speed was performed .",
    "so far the statistics of wind gusts can be interpreted as a superposition of idealized packets of turbulence at different reynoldsnumbers .",
    "+ as a further statistical feature of wind gusts we have investigated the waiting times between successive gusts exceeding a certain strength . here",
    "we find power - law - statistics ( fractal statistics )  similar to earthquake statistics  that can not be reproduced in laboratory measurements .",
    "+ to conclude we have shown two important aspects of wind gusts .",
    "the overall occurance statistics could be set into analogy to the anomalous statistics of velocity increments in local isotropic turbulence .",
    "the time structure of successive gust events displays fractal behaviour ."
