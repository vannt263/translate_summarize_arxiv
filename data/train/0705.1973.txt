    "the existence of magnetars  young , isolated neutron stars powered by the decay of an ultrahigh magnetic field  is now well supported by many independent lines of evidence @xcite .",
    "this comes from the study of soft - gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) and anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) , both of which classically exhibit x - ray pulsations having luminosity in the range 10@xmath5  erg  s@xmath6 , periods @xmath7 ranging from 5 - 12  s , @xmath8s of 10@xmath9@xmath310@xmath10 , and surface dipolar magnetic fields @xmath11 in the range 0.6@xmath37 @xmath12 10@xmath13  g , assuming vacuum dipole magnetic braking  g , where @xmath7 is the spin period in seconds and @xmath8 is the period derivative . ] .",
    "axps and sgrs , in the magnetar model , are ultimately powered by the internally decaying magnetic field . in the magnetar model , the pulsed x - rays",
    "are suggested to be the result of a combination of surface thermal emission and a non - thermal high - energy component from resonant scattering of thermal photons off magnetospheric currents @xcite .",
    "magnetar bursting , the hallmark of sgrs and also seen in axps , is believed to be a result of crustal yield and subsequent magnetospheric disturbances ultimately caused by stresses on the crust by the decaying internal field ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "recently , thanks in large part to long - term monitoring campaigns , it has become clear that axps exhibit a variety of types of aperiodic x - ray variability that can in principle be useful for testing aspects of the magnetar model .",
    "this variability can be categorized into four types , some of which are seen contemporaneously with each other : very short - duration sgr - like bursts , sudden outbursts and transient brightenings with decays lasting months or longer , slow - rise long - term flux variations also with slow decays , and pulse profile changes .",
    "classic examples of sgr - like bursts and an outburst were seen in 2002 for axp 1e  2259 + 586 , which exhibited a sudden order - of - magnitude increase in the pulsed and total flux , followed by a one - year - long flux decay ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the outburst was accompanied by over 80 short sgr - like bursts , a rotational glitch with interesting recovery on a time - scale of 2 weeks , short - lived spectral changes , and dramatic broad - band pulse morphology changes which included the two profile peaks swapping heights and which lasted 23 weeks .",
    "the event was consistent with the picture of sudden crustal yield influencing both the interior and the exterior of the axp , in analogy with large sgr bursts .",
    "several observations of this same source and others suggest similar outbursts in axps that went undetected .",
    "_ ginga _ observations of 1e  2259 + 586 reported by @xcite also showed a factor - of - two pulsed flux change and pulse profile variations , both of which , in hindsight , could be explained by a contemporaneous but short - lived outburst that went unseen . in axp  1rxs  j170849.0@xmath34000910 ,",
    "two rotational glitches were discovered ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite reported possible small pulse morphology changes associated with these glitches . whether these glitches were accompanied by bursting that went unobserved",
    "is unknown but plausible .",
    "the transient axp  xte  j1810@xmath3197 underwent a dramatic sudden brightening by nearly two orders of magnitude @xcite followed by a total flux decay that lasted years @xcite ; this may well have been an outburst similar to , though larger than that in 1e  2259 + 586 , but for which the brief main event went observed .",
    "similarly , the transient candidate axp  ax  j1845@xmath30258 underwent a factor @xmath14 decay in flux after an initial brightening that lead to its discovery @xcite .",
    "this too could have been the result of an unseen outburst .",
    "axp outbursts appear to be fundamentally different from the slow - rise , long - term flux variations seen in axp  1e  1048.1@xmath35937 .",
    "@xcite discovered two long - lived , slow - rise x - ray pulsed flux flares from this source .",
    "the first flare had peak pulsed flux a factor of @xmath152 greater than the quiescent level , and lasted @xmath15100 days .",
    "the second , larger flare had peak a factor of @xmath16 higher than in quiescence , and lasted over one year .",
    "the flares were accompanied by an increase in the phase - averaged flux of the source and a decrease in pulsed fraction , although the time scale and full dynamic range of the these changes have not been clearly established @xcite .",
    "no simultaneous pulse morphology changes were detected , and though the source did exhibit some sgr - like bursts @xcite , they were not obviously correlated with pulsed flux .",
    "large ( factor of 10 ) torque changes were seen especially during the large flare , but the correlation between torque and pulsed flux , at least on time scales smaller than the flare itself , was marginal .",
    "overall , the slow - rise flares seen in 1e  1048.1@xmath35937 are not thought to result from crustal cracking as in outbursts . they can , however , be explained by a spontaneous increase in the magnetic field twist in the magnetosphere .",
    "however what might trigger such events is unclear .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite and @xcite found , using observations of 1rxs  j170849.0@xmath3400910 which has also shown phase - averaged flux variability , that one important prediction of the twisted magnetosphere model appears to hold , namely a correlation between spectral hardness and flux .",

    "rxte _ monitoring , @xcite showed that 4u  0142 + 61 rotates with high stability .",
    "however , @xcite reported a possible timing glitch in 1999 on the basis of an _ asca _ observation in which the value of the frequency was marginally discrepant with the frequency as reported by @xcite .",
    "@xcite also reported simultaneous pulse morphology changes .",
    "as of 2006  april , in the published flux history of this source , there had been no reports of any x - ray activity like the flares of 1e  1048@xmath35937 and the outburst of 1e  2259 + 586 .",
    "however , very recently , in 2006 april and june and again in 2007 february @xcite sgr - like bursts were seen from 4u  0142 + 61 , along with a sudden pulse profile change and a timing anomaly . in this paper",
    "we refer to the history prior to april 2006 .    here",
    "we report on continued _ rxte _ monitoring observations in which we find a possibly new type of axp variability , namely a slow , long - term increase in the pulsed flux accompanied by slow pulse profile evolution .",
    "we also report on 10 years of timing and investigate the possibility of a glitch having occured in 1998 or 1999 , during an observing gap , which may have precipitated the evolution we are witnessing today .",
    "our observations are described in section  [ sec : observations ] .",
    "our timing , pulsed morphology , and pulse flux analysis are presented , respectively , in sections  [ sec : timing ] , [ sec : profile ] , and  [ sec : flux ] .",
    "we present a combined pulse shape and pulsed flux analysis in section  [ sec : combo ] . in section",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , we discuss the possible origins of this behavior and the implications for the magnetar model .",
    "the results presented here were obtained using the proportional counter array ( pca ) on board _",
    "rxte_. the pca consists of an array of five collimated xenon / methane multi - anode proportional counter units ( pcus ) operating in the 2@xmath360 kev range , with a total effective area of approximately 6500  @xmath19 and a field of view of @xmath151@xmath20 fwhm @xcite .",
    "our 136 observations are of various lengths ( see table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "most were obtained over a period of several years as part of a long - term monitoring program , but some are isolated observations ( see fig .  [ figure1 ] ) .",
    "note that there is a 2-year gap in the observations on which we are reporting : no _ rxte _ observations were made from 03/21/1998 ( mjd  50893.083 ) to 03/07/2000 ( mjd  51610.617 ) .",
    "the gap exists because 4u  0142 + 61 was only added to our regular axp monitoring program at the start of _ rxte _ cycle  5 .",
    "prior to the gap , our observations consist of a )  4  very closely spaced _ rxte _",
    "cycle  1 observations , b )  14  short  cycle  2 observations spanning a period of a year , and c )  a single cycle  3 observation .",
    "no observations were made in cycle  4 ( see  table  [ table1 ] , fig .  [ figure1 ] ) .",
    "for the monitoring , we used the goodxenonwithpropane data mode except during cycle 10 when we used the goodxenon mode . both data modes record photon arrival times with 1-@xmath21s resolution and bin energies into one of 256 channels . to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio",
    ", we analysed only those events from the top xenon layer of each pcu .",
    "photon arrival times at each epoch were adjusted to the solar system barycenter using the position obtained by @xcite from _ chandra _ data .",
    "they were then binned with 31.25-ms time resolution . in the timing analysis presented below ,",
    "we included only the events in the energy range 2@xmath310  kev ( unless otherwise specified ) to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio of the pulse .",
    "each barycentric binned time series was epoch - folded using an ephemeris determined iteratively by maintaining phase coherence ; see below . resulting pulse profiles , with 64 phase bins , were cross - correlated in the fourier domain with a high signal - to - noise template created by adding phase - aligned profiles from all observations .",
    "the cross - correlation returned an average pulse time of arrival ( toa ) for each observation corresponding to a fixed pulse phase . the pulse phase @xmath22 at any time @xmath23 can be expressed as a taylor expansion , @xmath24 where @xmath0  @xmath25  1/@xmath7 is the pulse frequency , @xmath1  @xmath25  @xmath26/@xmath27 , etc@xmath28 , and subscript `` 0 '' denotes a parameter evaluated at the reference epoch @xmath29 .",
    "the toas were fitted to the above polynomial using the pulsar timing software package tempo .",
    "we report an unambiguous phase - coherent timing solution that spans the post - gap ( i.e. after march 2000 , mjd 51610 ) 6-yr period up until february 2006 ( mjd 53787 ) including all data in _ rxte _ cycles  5@xmath310",
    ". the parameters of our best - fit spin - down model which includes @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 are presented in table  [ table2 ] .",
    "the corresponding phase residuals are shown in figure  [ figure2 ] .",
    "note the unmodelled features in the residuals ; these may be caused by a noise process similar to that commonly seen in radio pulsar timing ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the best - fit post - gap ephemeris does not , however , fit the pre - gap toas well .",
    "figure  [ figure3 ] shows a clear systematic deviation in the pre - gap residuals obtained after subtracting the post - gap ephemeris .",
    "the best - fit frequency obtained from the post - gap model at the reference epoch is larger than the frequency obtained from the best - fit model of the pre - gap toas at the same epoch ( see table  [ table2 ] ) .",
    "this , in principle , could indicate that a glitch occured at some time during the gap . at mjd  51250 ,",
    "midway between the pre - gap and the post - gap ephemerides , the fractional change in frequency due to the possible glitch is @xmath30@xmath0/@xmath0  =  ( 7.11@xmath40.15)@xmath1210@xmath31 .",
    "however , by using six frequency derivatives , we found a possible ephemeris that fits the entire cycle  1 to  10 range ( mjds  50170 to  53787 , see table  [ table2 ] ) .",
    "the rms phase residual for that ephemeris is 0.019 ( see fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] ) .",
    "note that when finding an ephemeris that spans several years , it is not uncommon to require a large number of frequency derivatives in order to reduce the rms phase residuals to a number on the order of 5% .",
    "this is typical especially in young pulsars and is generally attributed to timing noise ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the possibility of a glitch in 4u  0142 + 61 during our gap was in fact examined by @xcite .",
    "the authors showed that the frequency obtained from a 1998 august _ asca _ observation of 4u  0142 + 61 ( mjd  51046.699 ; 154 days after the start of our gap ) , differs from the frequency predicted at the epoch of the observation by the ephemerides previously reported for 4u  0142 + 61 in @xcite .",
    "@xcite , reported a frequency @xmath32  =  0.1150972(6 )  hz at mjd  51046.69875 for the _ asca _ observation .",
    "our overall ephemeris ( see table  [ table2 ] ) predicts @xmath32  =  0.115098404(3 )  hz at the same epoch .",
    "their measurement is within 2@xmath33 of our prediction , indicating a @xmath155% possibility that the two values are the same .",
    "therefore , their measured @xmath32 can be explained by a gradual change of the spin - down rate without invoking a glitch .",
    "however , the existence of our overall ephemeris can not rule out the possibility of the glitch : in some rotational glitches , the frequency evolution , given some relaxation time after the glitch epoch , returns to what it was prior to the glitch ( see for example the glitch reported in @xcite ) .",
    "if a glitch of this kind had happened inside the two - year gap , and if the length of the gap was much greater than the relaxation time , the only long - term effect of the glitch that could still be observable with a timing analysis would be a random phase jump in the post - relaxation toas relative to the pre - glitch toas . to investigate this possibility",
    ", we added an arbitrary but constant time jump to all the post - gap toas .",
    "we were still able to find a new ephemeris that connected the toas through the two - year gap .",
    "this indicates that our overall ephemeris is not unique .",
    "hence , we can not rule out the possibility of a random phase jump between cycles  3 and  5 , and therefore , a glitch can not be ruled out .",
    "it is important to note that our method for obtaining toas , ( cross - correlating the folded profiles of given observations with a high signal - to - noise template obtained from all the observations combined ) , assumes a constant pulse profile . in the next section ,",
    "we show that the pulse profile is actually varying during our monitoring program . however , we performed simulations which showed that these changes do not result in timing offsets significantly larger than the reported toa uncertainties .",
    "hence the profile variations do not affect the above analysis .",
    "we performed a pulse profile analysis using ftools version 5.3.1 .",
    "we used the following steps : for each observation , we ran the ftool ` make_se ` to combine the goodxenon files .",
    "we then used the ftool ` fasebin ` to make a phase - resolved spectrum of the entire observation with 64 phase bins across the profile . when we ran ` fasebin ` , we selected layer  1 of the detector , disregarded the propane photons , and included the photons from pcus  1 ,  2 ,  3 , and  4 .",
    "we disregarded photons from pcu  0 because of the loss of its propane layer in 2000 @xcite and because it gave different results from the other pcus . `",
    "fasebin ` also took care of barycentering the data . for each observation , we then used ` seextrct ` to make a phase - averaged spectrum for the same set of detector layers and pcus .",
    "the phase - averaged spectrum was then used by the perl script ` pcarsp ` to make a response matrix .",
    "we loaded the phase - resolved spectra and the response matrices into the x - ray spectral fitting package ( xspec ) and selected photons belonging to three energy bands : 2@xmath310 , 2@xmath34 , and  6@xmath38  kev . using xspec , we extracted an ascii count rate pulse profile for each of the energy bands .",
    "the profiles included xspec - obtained 1@xmath33 error bars on each of the phase bins in the profiles . to obtain a pulse profile in units of count rate per pcu",
    ", we divided the overall profile by a pcu coverage factor that took into account the amount of time each pcu was on .",
    "we then aligned the 64-bin profiles with a high signal - to - noise template using a similar cross - correlation procedure to the one described in the timing analysis .",
    "then , for each _ rxte _ cycle , we summed the aligned profiles , extracted the dc component from the summed profile , and scaled the resulting profile so that the value of the highest bin is unity and the lowest point is zero .",
    "the average profiles in all three bands are presented in figure  [ figure5 ] for comparison . in a given band ,",
    "the different profile qualities are due to different net exposure times .",
    "it is important to note that the two narrow energy bands that we are using contain photons belonging to different spectral components : from the spectrum of 4u  0142 + 61 ( see , for example , @xcite ) , under the assumption that the spectrum is well described by a blackbody plus power - law tail , we know that the higher energy band ( 6@xmath38  kev ) contains negligible blackbody emission , while the lower energy band ( 2@xmath34  kev ) contains comparable amounts of blackbody and power - law emission .    qualitatively , the evolution of the pulse profiles in the first two bands of figure  [ figure5 ] is clear to the eye . in cycles  1 and  2 ,",
    "the smaller peak , obvious in later cycles , is not very well defined .",
    "after the two - year gap , in cycle  5 , the ` dip ' between the peaks is much more pronounced .",
    "the emission in the dip starts to most noticeably rise in cycles subsequent to cycle  7 . in the 6@xmath38  kev band",
    ", the smaller peak appears to have lower amplitude in the normalized profiles than in 2@xmath34  kev , indicating that it has a softer spectrum relative to the larger peak .",
    "another qualitative observation is that the ratio of the heights of the two peaks in the 2@xmath310  kev and 2@xmath34  kev bands appears to be closest to unity in the first cycle after the gap .",
    "the ratio starts to decrease in the cycles subsequent to cycle  5 .",
    "note that from this figure alone we can compare the sizes of the two peaks , but we can not track the evolution of the heights of each peak separately . in order to do that , we need to scale the pulse profile of each cycle by the average pulsed flux .",
    "this analysis is presented in section  [ sec : combo ] .      to quantify the changes in the pulse profile , we computed the first six fourier amplitudes of the average profiles of each cycle in each energy band .",
    "harmonic numbers larger than 6 were always consistent with zero . the results are shown in figures  [ figurefou1 ] , [ figurefou2 ] , and [ figurefou3 ] . in each of the three figures ,",
    "the plots on the right show the power in each harmonic divided by the total power in all harmonics ( not including the dc term ) . in the plots on the left , the observed pulse profiles are in the background ( hollow squares without error bars ) .",
    "the superimposed smooth curve in the foreground is made from the first six calculated fourier components .",
    "the ratios of the first three fourier harmonics relative to the fundamental are presented in figure  [ figureratios ] .",
    "note that the ratios of the fourier harmonics are not presented for cycle  3 in figures  [ figurefou1 ] , [ figurefou2 ] , and [ figurefou3 ] due to the very low signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "significant variations were seen in the pulse profile of 4u  0142 + 61 in the 2@xmath310  kev band and in 2@xmath34  kev ; on the left side of both figures  [ figurefou1 ] and  [ figurefou2 ] , the most striking variable feature is the difference in the relative heights between the top of either peak and the bottom of the dip . on the right side ,",
    "considering the first two fourier components , the ratio of the second to first amplitudes ( a@xmath34/a@xmath35 ) is significantly bigger than unity only in cycle  5 .",
    "it then falls steadily until , in cycle  10 , it reaches the same ratio as in cycle  1 .",
    "the evolution of the a@xmath34/a@xmath35 ratio in 2@xmath34  kev is shown in figure  [ figureratios ] . in the pre - gap cycles ,",
    "harmonics of order higher than 2 are only marginally significant . in the post - gap cycles , harmonics  3 and  4 are most significant in cycles  5 and  6 , coinciding with the cycles where the dip in the time - domain curve is sharpest .",
    "the evolution of the a@xmath36/a@xmath35 and the a@xmath37/a@xmath35 ratios is also shown in figure  [ figureratios ] .",
    "note the obvious rise in the harmonic ratios just post - gap in the soft - band , with apparent subsequent evolution to pre - gap values .    in the 6@xmath38  kev band ( see fig .",
    "[ figurefou3 ] ) , statements about the behavior of the fourier components are harder to make because of the poor signal - to - noise ratio ; nevertheless some trends are clear . unlike in the lower energy band , the a@xmath34/a@xmath35 ratio does not appear to systematically increase or decrease . also unlike in the lower band , harmonics  3 and  4 do not appear to vary systematically ( see fig .",
    "[ figureratios ] ) .",
    "thus , in the band where all the emission is from the power - law component of the spectrum , the variations in the shape of the pulse profile , if any , are much less significant than the variation in the 2@xmath34  kev band which contains photons belonging to both components of the spectrum .      to obtain a pulsed flux time series for 4u  0142 + 61 , we did the following .",
    "first , for each pcu in each observation , we used a procedure similar to that described in section  [ sec : qual ] to make a phase resolved spectrum ( with 16 phase bins across the profile ) and a response matrix .",
    "we then used the ftool ` fmodtab ` to correct the exposure value in the phase resolved spectrum of each pcu in order to take into account the amount of time that each pcu was on .",
    "then , for each observation , we added the spectra obtained from pcus  1 to  4 using the ftool ` fbadd ` and added the responses using the ftool ` addrmf ` .",
    "we used ` fbadd ` and ` addrmf ` again to add the spectra and responses of all observations in a given _ rxte _ cycle .",
    "for each _ rxte _ cycle , we loaded the phase resolved spectra into xspec , and selected photons in the 2@xmath310  kev range . using xspec , we extracted an ascii count rate pulse profile for each _ rxte _ cycle .",
    "the profiles included xspec - determined 1@xmath33 error bars on each of the phase bins .",
    "we then smoothed each of the profiles by eliminating the fourier components corresponding to harmonic numbers larger than five .",
    "the pulsed flux for each of the smoothed profiles was calculated using the following discrete area formula : @xmath38 where @xmath39 refers to the phase bin , @xmath40=16 is the total number of phase bins , @xmath41 is the count rate in the @xmath42 phase bin of the smoothed pulse profile , and @xmath43 is the value of the minimum of the continuous smooth function that is made from the first five fourier components of the original profile .    the resulting pulsed flux history in counts / s / pcu is shown in the top panel of figure  [ figure7 ] .",
    "each point represents one _ rxte _ cycle .",
    "the pulsed flux has increased by 36@xmath43% between cycles  7 and  9 .",
    "a quick rebinning of the observations shows that the increase period lasted @xmath15  2.6  yr ( between mjds  52400   and  53350 ) .",
    "we verified that the same trend is detected in pcus  1@xmath34 individually , and that there are no comparable trends in the long - term light curves of the other 4  axps observed as part of this monitoring program .",
    "we repeated the above procedure of finding the flux for narrower energy bands .",
    "there are hints that the long - term increase is present in the 2@xmath34  kev band and not in 6@xmath38  kev but our statistics do not let us confirm this . if the pulsed flux increase is restricted to @xmath44  6  kev , this could indicate that the spectrum of the pulsed emission is getting softer .",
    "motivated by this possibility , we performed a detailed spectral analysis of four available archival _ xmm _ observations .",
    "we found that the spectrum is indeed getting softer ( gonzalez  et  al . in preparation ) .",
    "note that the method that we used to calculate the pulsed flux , which consisted of calculating the pulsed area under the profile , is more sensitive to noise than are measurements of the rms pulsed flux like those used in @xcite . therefore , to reduce the effects of noise , it was necessary to combine the data from entire cycles in order to obtain each of the pulsed area points reported in the top panel of figure  [ figure7 ] , hence the large horizontal error bars .",
    "we report measurements of the pulsed area instead of rms pulsed flux because , while it is true that measurements of the latter are less sensitive to noise , changes in it can be caused by changes in the real pulsed area and _ also _ by variations in the pulse profile . as a double check , we calculated the rms pulsed flux for each observation , found the average of the resulting fluxes in each _ rxte _ cycle , and multiplied each average by a conversion factor dependent on the pulse shape , in order to obtain a pulsed area .",
    "when we plotted these pulsed areas versus time , we obtained a similar trend to that see in the top panel of figure  [ figure7 ] .",
    "for further discussion of the various methods used to estimate the pulsed flux see archibald et al .",
    "( 2007 , in preparation ) .    in order to verify that the trend seen in the top panel of figure  [ figure7 ] is not an artifact of the response of the detector , and in order to verify that the relative levels in the pre - gap and the post - gap flux values are not skewed due to an evolution of the response of the detector , we calculated the pulsed flux in erg / s/@xmath19 using an additional method that took the evolution of the response into account . for each",
    "_ rxte _ cycle , we obtained one phase resolved spectrum ( with 16 phase bins across the profile ) and one response matrix using the method described above .",
    "this time we included pcu  0 .",
    "then , we defined the background phase bin to be that where @xmath43 lies .",
    "we then used the ftool ` cmppha ` to combine the spectra of all phase bins into a single phase - averaged spectrum .",
    "then , using xspec , we subtracted the spectrum of the background bin from the combined spectrum of the remaining phase bins , scaling the exposure appropriately .",
    "when subtracting the spectrum of the background bin from the spectrum of the remaining bins , we assumed that the resulting spectrum is , to a good approximation , that of the pulsed component of the emission .",
    "for each _ rxte _ cycle , we fit the spectrum of the pulsed emission with a model that consisted of a black body plus a power law . when doing the fitting we froze the temperature of the black body to the value @xmath45",
    "=  0.44  kev , the power - law photon index to @xmath46  =  3.94 and the column density of neutral hydrogen to @xmath47  =  0.99@xmath1210@xmath48  @xmath49 .",
    "these parameters were obtained from a linked spectral fit of the four archival xmm observations ( see gonzalez et al . in preparation ) .",
    "we let the normalizations of the two components of the spectrum vary freely . after the fit was done , we extracted the pulsed flux numbers from the fitted spectrum of the pulsed emission of each _ rxte _ cycle .",
    "we multiplied the 1@xmath33 error bars returned by xspec by the square root of the reduced chi squared of the spectral fit .",
    "this multiplication is equivalent to assuming that the model being fit is the right one to use and that any bad - fit results from an initial underestimation of the error bars of the spectrum that is being fitted .",
    "the resulting pulsed flux values in erg / s/@xmath19 for each of the _ rxte _ cycles are presented in the bottom panel of figure  [ figure7 ] .",
    "the trend observed in the pulsed flux is similar to that in the top panel .",
    "the observed increase between cycles  7 and  9 is 29@xmath48% , consistent with that found in the first analysis .",
    "however , after having taken the response of the detector into account , the pulsed flux in the pre - gap observations appears to be consistent with the pulsed flux in the first post - gap cycle .    from the bottom panel of figure  [ figure7 ] , the increase in the pulsed flux is @xmath15  2.1@xmath12@xmath50  erg  s@xmath6  @xmath49 in the 2@xmath310  kev band . assuming a distance of 2.5  kpc @xcite , the total luminosity increase in the @xmath15  2.6-yr period during which the increase happened is @xmath15  1.1@xmath12@xmath51  erg  s@xmath6 .",
    "this increase is of the same order of magnitude as the average energy release rate in the first 1e  1048@xmath35937 flare @xcite .",
    "it is also an order of magnitude smaller than the average energy release rate in the first day following the outburst in 1e  2259 + 586 @xcite .",
    "the amount of energy released in the same 2.6-year period due to the increase in the pulsed flux is @xmath15  9@xmath12@xmath52  erg in the 2@xmath310  kev band .",
    "this is comparable to the energy released in the second 1e  1048@xmath35937 flare @xcite , and to the energy released in the in the year following the outburst in 1e  2259 + 586 @xcite .      in section  [ sec : fourier ]",
    ", we calculated the fourier components of the average pulse profiles .",
    "this gave us the relative amplitude of the pulse profile harmonics in each _ rxte _ cycle .",
    "in section  [ sec : flux ] , we calculated the pulsed flux for every observation . here ,",
    "we compute a weighted average of the pulsed flux for each cycle using the flux points calculated in section  [ sec : flux ] .",
    "we then reconstruct the profiles for each of the cycles from the first six fourier components ( not including the dc ) , scale them by the average rms pulsed flux for that cycle , and add the necessary offset for the lowest point on each curve to be zero .",
    "this means that the resulting scaled profiles return the correct pulsed flux .",
    "the advantage of this analysis is that we can now trace the evolution of each of the peaks independently .",
    "the post - gap scaled profiles in 2@xmath310  kev and in 2@xmath34  kev are presented in the top panels of figures  [ figurefeatures210 ] and  [ figurefeatures24 ] , respectively .",
    "we did not include a similar figure for 6@xmath38  kev because of the poor signal - to - noise ratio in that band .",
    "the absolute heights of the peaks in the post - gap cycles , as well as the absolute height of the dip in between , are plotted in the bottom panels of figures  [ figurefeatures210 ] and  [ figurefeatures24 ] .",
    "the error bars take into account both the errors on the fourier components and the errors on the pulsed flux .    in both figures ,",
    "there is a hint of increase in the height of the big peak between cycles  7 and  9 .",
    "the dip between the peaks appears to be getting shallower more rapidly between cycles  7 and  9 .",
    "the difference in the height of the dip over these 3  years is more significant than the difference in the height of either peaks .",
    "this indicates that the biggest contribution to the change in the pulsed flux comes from an increase in the emission in the dip , which , in principle , could be caused by the widening of either peak around the dip .",
    "could a short - time scale energetic event ( such as an outburst like that seen in 2002 for 1e  2259 + 586 ) have occured sometime within the two - year gap and triggered the pulsed flux and pulse profile changes that we are observing ? as discussed above , the possibility of a glitch during the gap was examined by @xcite . here ,",
    "an examination of our timing , flux , and pulse profile analyses can provide further clues to help answer this question .    from our timing analysis ( section  [ sec : timing ] ) , there is some evidence for a glitch having occured sometime during our gap .",
    "hence , if an outburst did occur , it might have been accompanied by a glitch , as was the case for the 2002 outburst of 1e  2259 + 586 @xcite .",
    "if there was a glitch in 4u  0142 + 61 , the unrecovered fractional change in frequency would have been ( 7.11@xmath40.15)@xmath1210@xmath31 , a factor of  6 smaller than the maximum fractional frequency change of ( 4.24@xmath40.11)@xmath1210@xmath53 observed in 1e  2259 + 586 .",
    "the fact that the pulsed flux in the first post - gap observations is consistent with that in the last pre - gap observations could be consistent with an outburst in between if the initial flux increase during an outburst had time to die down ( see fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] ) .",
    "if we assume that the return of the pulse profile to its pre - gap shape is a recovery following an outburst , this would imply a much longer timescale for the pulse profile relaxation phase than for the pulsed flux relaxation , the opposite to what was seen following the 1e  2259 + 586 outburst @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the post - outburst pulse profile relaxation could have been completed during the gap , and the slow return of the post - gap profile to its pre - gap morphology could be attributed to a different phenomenon .",
    "this is further discussed in section  [ sec : phys ] . in either case , if there was an event during the gap , why the pulsed flux is presently rising is unclear . if the event associated with the putative glitch released energy deep in the neutron - star crust , then the increase could be due to its slow release ( eg . @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "given the size of the observed flux increase and its timescale for release , the initial energy deposition would have had to have been large , @xmath1510@xmath54  erg @xcite .",
    "this is comparable to the observed energy release in giant sgr flares @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the pulse shape prior to the gap is the `` relaxed '' pulse shape , the evolution of the harmonic ratios shown in figure  [ figureratios ] supports the possibility of relaxation of the profile following an event in the gap . to shed light on the events in the gap , we can compare our _ rxte _ profiles with those observed with _ asca _ by @xcite . in their figure  4 , pulse profiles in 0.5@xmath310  kev for a ) september 1994 , b ) august 1998 , and c ) combined july and august 1999 profiles are presented . in the 1994 and 1998 observations ,",
    "the profile consisted of two peaks , with the trailing peak being the smallest , with the dip between the peaks being higher than the lowest bin in the profiles .",
    "the shape of the 1998 profile is in agreement with the _ rxte _ pre - gap average pulse profiles for cycle  2 ( see fig .",
    "[ figurefou1 ] ) . in the 1999 _ asca _",
    "profile , the amplitude of the trailing peak was _ higher _ than that of the leading peak .",
    "in addition , the difference between the height of the dip and the lowest point in the profile decreased .",
    "interestingly , the changes in the _ asca _ profiles appeared more significant at the lower end of the energy band , as we observe in our _ rxte _ data . in 2000 , the first _",
    "rxte _ cycle after the gap has a profile in which the trailing peak is once again smaller than the leading peak .",
    "the dip between the peaks , however , is still more pronounced than in the pre - gap observations .",
    "overall , the timing data and the pulse profile data are consistent with some sort of event , possibly a glitch with accompanying sudden pulse profile change , having occured between 1998 august and 1999 july , possibly with the latter s long - term relaxation still ongoing as of early 2006 .",
    "however , we suggest an alternate explanation for the latter point below .      in the detailed magnetar model proposed by @xcite ,",
    "the crust of a magnetar is deformed by internal magnetic stresses , thereby twisting the footpoints of the external magnetic field , driving powerful currents in the magnetosphere and twisting the magnetosphere relative to the standard dipolar geometry .",
    "these magnetospheric currents resonantly cyclotron scatter seed surface thermal photons . the seed contribution to the thermal component of the spectrum",
    "is thought to arise from heat resulting from the active decay of a high internal magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the magnetospheric scattering is responsible for the non - thermal component of axp spectra .",
    "additionally , the surface is back - heated by the currents , resulting in additional thermal emission .",
    "indeed , the persistent emission in axps generally has a spectrum that is well described by a two - component model , consisting of a blackbody plus a hard power - law tail , as expected in this model .",
    "changes in pulsed and/or total x - ray luminosity , spectral hardness , and torque are predicted to have a common physical origin in the @xcite model and some correlations are expected .",
    "changes in twist angle of the magnetic field , cause , or may be caused by , changes in the magnetospheric current distribution ( due either to sudden crustal deformation like in axp  outbursts and sgr  giant flares or due to slower crustal deformations as may be taking place in the axp  flares ; @xcite ) .",
    "larger twists generally correspond to harder persistent x - ray spectra and higher magnitudes of the spin - down rates , as is observed when comparing the harder sgr spectra to those of the softer axps @xcite .",
    "a similar trend might be expected for a single magnetar exhibiting luminosity variations : a higher luminosity should correspond to a larger twist , hence harder spectrum , as has been reported for 1rxs  j170849.0@xmath3400910 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a higher luminosity should also in general correspond to a larger magnitude of the spin - down rate .",
    "however , decoupling between the torque and the luminosity can occur because the torque is most sensitive to the current flowing on a relatively narrow bundle of field lines that are anchored close to the magnetic pole . for a single source , whether an x - ray luminosity change will be accompanied by a torque change depends on where in relation to the magnetic pole the source of the enhanced x - rays sits .",
    "the @xcite model can also explain properties of the pulse profiles of magnetars . according to the model",
    ", several effects can affect the pulse shape , generate subpulses , and/or increase the energy dependence of the pulse profile .",
    "in addition , an increase in the twisting angle of the magnetic field increases multiple scattering and increases the optical depth to resonant scattering which can simplify the pulse shape .",
    "this is one of the two proposed explanations for the sudden simplification of the pulse profile of sgr  1900 + 14 after its dramatic giant - flare @xcite , the other explanation being the sudden elimination of the nonaxisymmetric components of the magnetospheric currents @xcite .      in this paper",
    ", we have shown that the pulsed flux of 4u  0142 + 61 has increased on a time scale of a few years , and we have found simultaneous slow pulse profile evolution in the 2@xmath34  kev band , which may to be recovering from some event that occured prior to 2000 but after 1997 , possibly in the interval between 1998 august and 1999 july .",
    "we have also found evidence , as first suggested by @xcite , that there was a timing glitch in that same interval , although we can not confirm its existence .",
    "can the magnetar model explain these observations ?",
    "the energy dependence of the pulse profile evolution is puzzling .",
    "as described above , in the twisted magnetosphere model of @xcite , the non - thermal emission in an axp is the result of magnetospheric scattering of surface thermal photons .",
    "if the surface emission angular pattern were changing , therefore , the non - thermal angular pattern should as well . that we do not observe comparable pulse profile changes in the 6@xmath38  kev band for 4u  0142 + 61 is thus puzzling .",
    "one possibility is that the seed thermal emission is not changing appreciably , but the scattering currents in the outer regions of the magnetosphere , where the cyclotron energy is lower , are changing , while the inner currents are not .",
    "this could arise if there is evolution in the field configuration closer to the magnetic poles , with relatively little closer to the magnetic equator .",
    "why variations in the field configuration should be geographically localized , however , is unclear .",
    "the increase in the pulsed flux over a similar time scale as that of the profile evolution is apparently accompanied by a softening of the spectrum ( gonzalez  et  al . in preparation ) .",
    "as discussed above , the putative 1998/1999 glitch may have deposited a large amount of energy in the crust , with it only starting to be radiated away in 2002 .",
    "the energy released would have had to have been large , @xmath1510@xmath54  erg @xcite .",
    "such a thermal energy release could be influencing the pulse profile as well , although some change in profile would be expected in the hard band too , which is not observed .",
    "moreover , such an increase has not been observed following the glitches in 1e  2259 + 586 or 1rxs 170849.0@xmath3400910 , although this could be a result of smaller total energy releases .",
    "alternatively , the increase in pulsed flux seen in 4u  0142 + 61 between 2002 and 2005 could be explained by the twisted magnetosphere model . in this framework , there are two possibilities : _ a ) _ a slow _ in_crease in the twist of the magnetic field lines in the magnetosphere , or , _ b ) _ a slow _ de_crease in the twist angle .    in the first possibility",
    ", the observed increase in the pulsed flux could be an extreme case of the 1e  1048@xmath35937 flares , i.e. a slow twisting of the magnetic field lines in the suggested interpretation of @xcite .",
    "this explanation is only valid if the total flux , which remains to be determined with an imaging telescope , is increasing as well . how this would be related to the putative 1998/1999 event",
    "is unclear ; any flux enhancement that occured then would have had to have largely decayed away by 2000 . in any case , for an increase in the twist angle , one expects a spectral hardening @xcite .",
    "we do not observe this .",
    "also for an increase in the twist angle , at least naively , the twisted magnetosphere model predicts an increase in torque as the flux rises @xcite . from table",
    "[ table2 ] , the post - gap ephemeris @xmath2 is positive , meaning @xmath1 is increasing , i.e. the magnitude of the pulsar s spin down rate is decreasing , the opposite of what is expected for a flux increase , unless the magnetospheric currents causing the torque are flowing only in the small polar cap region .",
    "finally , if the slow increase in pulsed flux were caused by a slow magnetospheric twisting , the decrease in the size of the fourier components of order higher than unity in the low energy band could be interpreted as a simplification of the pulse profile due to an increase in the scattering in the magnetosphere . however , the most extreme case of a pulse profile simplification , which was reported in sgr  1900 + 14 , happened equally in all bands following a dramatic increase in the scattering after a giant flare ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the phenomenon that we have observed , by contrast , is restricted to the softer energies .    in the previous paragraph",
    ", we mentioned that the increase in the pulsed flux and the gradual changes in the pulse profile may indicate stress build - up caused by an increase in the twist angle in the magnetosphere .",
    "the pulse profiles of cycles  2 and  10 are very similar , indicating that the pulse profile of cycle  2 may also be showing signs of the same kind of stress build - up . under these assumptions , if an event occured in the gap following cycle  2 , it is reasonable to expect a similar event to follow after cycle  10 .",
    "indeed , in 2006 april , less than 2  months after the end of cycle  10 , the pulsar appears to have entered an extended active phase : a single burst accompanied by a pulse profile change was detected from the pulsar on april  6  @xcite .",
    "a series of four bursts was later detected on june  25  @xcite and a larger burst was detected on 2007 february  07  @xcite .",
    "a detailed paper on these events is currently in preparation .",
    "if they are indeed due to a stress release following several years of slow magnetospheric twist , then the causes of the softening of the spectrum and of the decrease in the magnitude of the pulsar s spin - down are unclear .",
    "the second possibility in the framework of the twisted magnetosphere model , is that the observed increase in the pulsed flux is accompanying a slow _ de_crease in the twist angle of the magnetic field lines in the magnetosphere .",
    "this explanation is only valid if the total flux is decreasing . if the total flux were falling with the pulsed fraction rising , the observed spectral softening could be consistent with naive _ un_twisting expectations as would the decreasing spin - down rate .",
    "indeed an anti - correlation between total flux and pulsed fraction was observed by @xcite for 1e  1048.1@xmath35937 , supporting this possibility .",
    "however , the problem of why the pulse profile is evolving at low , but not high energies , remains .",
    "4u 0142 + 61 is truly a multi - wavelength axp .",
    "it is known to pulsate in the optical band @xcite and it has been detected in the near - ir @xcite , in the mid - ir using _ spitzer _",
    "@xcite , and in hard x - rays @xcite .",
    "the origin of the emission at these other wavelengths remains unclear , although some models have been proposed .",
    "in hard x - rays , @xcite argue that the emission is either due to bremsstrahlung photons emitted by a thin surface layer , or is due to synchrotron emission originating from the region in the magnetosphere where the electron cyclotron energy is in the kev range .",
    "the near - ir and optical emission is thought to be magnetospheric @xcite , while the mid - ir emission is suggested to be due to a passive fall - back disk @xcite .",
    "looking for correlations between the x - rays and the emission in other wavelengths may serve as tests of emission models , as correlations between x - ray and near - ir fluxes have sometimes been observed .",
    "for example , a correlation in the decays of the x - ray and near - ir fluxes in 1e  2259 + 586 was observed following the 2002 outburst @xcite ; a similar correlation was reported for xte  j1810@xmath3197 @xcite . however , in other instances , the two fluxes were not correlated , as for 1e  1048@xmath35937 ( @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) . in 4u  0142 + 61 , reported variations in the ir are not seen contemporaneously in our x - ray data , and are on time scales much shorter than that of the x - ray variation reported here @xcite .",
    "@xcite observed mid - ir emission from 4u  0142 + 61 which they argue is associated with a passive fall - back disk irradiated by the central x - ray pulsar .",
    "if this is the case , then if 4u  0142 + 61 s x - ray flux is increasing , one expects a corresponding increase in the disk emission .",
    "it is thus important to establish the behavior of the total flux , in addition to that of the pulsed flux reported on here .",
    "the possible presence of a disk suggests that if a sudden , impulsive outburst occured in the gap , the energy released must have been significantly smaller than the disk binding energy , after accounting for the disk thickness . for a central pulsar mass of @xmath55  1.4@xmath56 , a uniform disk of mass @xmath57  3@xmath58 , and inner and outer radii @xmath59  3@xmath60 and @xmath61",
    "10@xmath60 @xcite the disk binding energy is @xmath154@xmath1210@xmath62  erg .",
    "since the x - ray luminosity of the source ( @xmath1510@xmath63  erg / s ) integrated over a period @xmath64  yr is much larger than the binding energy of the observed disk , one must assume that when the source is not undergoing an outburst , the disk is in an equilibrium state where the rate of energy absorption is balanced by the rate of disk emission .",
    "assuming this equilibrium can not hold on the timescale of a sudden outburst , then ir observations of the disk provide an upper limit of ( 4@xmath1210@xmath62/@xmath32 )  erg on the energy released in a possible outburst in the gap , where @xmath32 is the fraction of the solid angle occupied by the thickness of the disk . for @xmath32",
    "=  0.01 , this upper limit is three orders of magnitude larger than the total energy released during the flares of 1e  1048@xmath35937 @xcite .",
    "it is also five orders of magnitude larger than the energy released during the first day of the 1e  2259 + 586 outburst @xcite .",
    "thus , an event in the gap of either the magnitude of the flares or that of the outburst occuring could have affected the disk but seems unlikely to have disrupted it . for @xmath32  =  0.01 , the upper limit is also of the same magnitude as the energy released in either of the sgr  1900 + 14 or the sgr  0526@xmath366 giant flares @xcite .",
    "this suggests that there have been no events of the magnitude of the giant sgr flares since the putative disk s formation .",
    "given that we have witnessed 3 giant sgr flares each from a different source since 1979 , and none from axps , this suggests that axps do not exhibit giant flares .",
    "this would suggest an interesting distinction between sgrs and axps : if the two are evolutionary linked , the axp phase must come first , unless a debris disk can reform following a giant flare .",
    "the mid - ir emission has also been interpreted as an active fall - back disk in which the pulsar is accreting in a propeller mode . in this case , the dipole field strength of the pulsar is typical of conventional radio pulsars , ie .",
    "@xmath65  g @xcite , although the surface field strength is in the magnetar range , owing to higher order multipoles . in this model ,",
    "the x - rays arise from propeller accretion . without detailed models of the spectra and of the pulse",
    "shapes expected in this model , we can not interpret our observations in this framework .",
    "nevertheless , one might expect a torque change with luminosity in this model . for 4u  0142 + 61 , as noted in section  [ sec : phys ] , the magnitude of the torque is decreasing while the pulsed flux is increasing .",
    "if propeller accretion is occuring , then the total flux should be decreasing ; this can be checked ( gonzalez et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "we note that evidence against such a torque / luminosity correlation has been presented by @xcite for a different axp .",
    "our continuing _ rxte _ monitoring program has revealed a possibly new axp variability phenomenon : 4u  0142 + 61 exhibited a slow but steady increase in its pulsed flux between 2002 may and 2004 december , such that it has risen 36@xmath43% over 2.6 years in the 2@xmath310  kev band .",
    "this is accompanied by a softening of the spectrum ( gonzalez  et  al . in preparation ) .",
    "quasi - simultaneously , the pulse profile , which comprises two peaks having different spectra , has been evolving since 2000 .",
    "in particular , the dip of emission between the two peaks has been rising since 2002 , as if it is returning to its pre-2000 morphology in which there was no clear distinction between the peaks .",
    "the profile evolution translates to a reduction of the power in the fourier harmonics of order higher than one since 2000 .",
    "this is in contrast with the pulsed flux which seems to be moving _",
    "away _ from the pre-2000 value .",
    "the evolution in the pulse profile is seen in the 2@xmath34  kev band but not in the 6@xmath38  kev band , presenting an interesting puzzle to the twisted magnetosphere model for magnetars .",
    "intriguingly , @xcite have suggested the pulsar suffered a glitch just before 2000 on the basis of a single discrepant _ asca _ period measurement .",
    "our phase - coherent timing using _ rxte _ demonstrates that a glitch is plausible but not necessary to explain the data , but our pulse profile evolution analysis provides new evidence for such an event having occured .    physical interpretations that described well other observed long - term changes in axp emission ( such as outburst afterglow or flux flares caused by an increased twist in the magnetosphere ) do not explain all the phenomena that we have observed .",
    "most of our observations could be explained by the twisted magnetosphere model if the total flux of 4u  0142 + 61 is actually decreasing .",
    "this would indicate a slow _ un_twisting in the magnetosphere .",
    "alternatively , if the total flux is increasing , a slow _ increase _ in the twist angle in the magnetosphere can account for the pulse profile simplification and for the post - cycle  10 events , but the changes in the spin - down rate and the softening of the spectrum would remain unexplained . finally , the data could be explained by energy release following an energy deposition , perhaps due to a glitch that occured in the crust of the star sometime during the post cycle  2 gap , although the energy deposited would have had to have been large .",
    "no matter what , the absence of profile evolution at high energies remains a puzzle .",
