    "an observer unaware of the interaction and fitting the data assuming normal cdm implicitly ascribes this dark matter deficit to the dark energy .",

    "( [ sl ] ) implies that @xmath6 has negligible kinetic energy compared to potential energy , which is the definition of slow - roll .",
    "the slow - roll property has many virtues .",
    "first of all , it implies that our attractor solution is different than that derived by amendola and collaborators  @xcite . in their case , during the matter - dominated era , the scalar field kinetic energy dominates over the potential energy and remains a fixed fraction of the critical density .",

    "microwave background anisotropy then constrains the dark matter - dark energy coupling to be less than gravitational strength : @xmath59 for @xmath53 . in our case , as we will see in sec .",

    "note that in usual quintessence models ( without dark matter interaction ) , slow - roll is achieved in the large @xmath48 limit , for which .",

    "( [ sl ] ) shows that this ratio is further suppressed by @xmath61 in our case .",
    "the attractor solution described here has a large basin of attraction .",
    "the covariant form of eq .",
    "( [ phieom2 ] ) involves @xmath62 , the trace of the stress tensor of all fields coupled to @xmath6 .",
    "these do not exclusively consist of dm .",

    "in this section we illustrate our mechanism within a specific model .",
    "we consider an inverse power - law potential , @xmath39 , where the mass scale @xmath64 is tuned to @xmath65  ev in order for acceleration to occur at the present epoch .",

    "the exponential form is generic in dimensional reduction in string theory where @xmath6 measures the volume of extra dimensions .",

    "we argue that this is also the case when considering inhomogeneities , at least at the linear level .",
    "the main effect here is the fifth force between dark matter particles mediated by @xmath6 , which enhances the growth rate of density perturbations .",
    "a rigorous comparison with observations would require a full likelihood analysis including a host of cosmological probes , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we instead contend ourselves with a simplified ( and perhaps more conservative ) analysis to derive general constraints . as in sec .",
    "[ example ] , we focus on an exponential coupling function and inverse power - law potential .",
    "the tightest constraint comes from various estimates of the dark matter density at different redshifts .",
    "since the dark matter redshifts more slowly than @xmath13 in our model , then for fixed present matter density this implies a smaller matter density in the past compared to a cdm model .",
    "indeed , at early times ( @xmath84 ) , the matter density differs from that of a usual dust cdm model by e^-_0/m_pl = ( - ) , [ ratrho2 ] where in the last step we have used eq .",
    "( [ phi0 ] ) .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that this ratio can not deviate too much from unity , for otherwise we risk running into conflict with estimates of the matter density at various redshifts , _ e.g. _ from galaxy counts , lyman-@xmath79 forest , weak lensing etc .",
    "this is supported by the fact that the allowed range of @xmath85 is almost independent of the specifics of the dark energy , as derived from a general analysis  @xcite of the combined snia `` gold '' data  @xcite , wilkinson anisotropy microwave probe ( wmap ) power spectra  @xcite and two - degree field ( 2df ) galaxy survey  @xcite . in particular @xmath86 at @xmath87 ( see also  @xcite ) .",

    "this is crucial in satisfying constraints on @xmath85 and traces back to our choice of inverse power - law potential .",
    "in contrast , the exponential potential studied in  @xcite has a very different attractor solution . in this case ,",
    "dark energy remains a constant fraction of the total energy density and modifies the dm equation of state at all redshift .",
    "this in turn renders the matter density negligibly small for @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , in order to satisfy constraints on @xmath85 ( as well as @xmath91 ) , one must introduce a second dm component , which is non - interacting and dominates for most of the history .",

    "probe the actual mass since photons are oblivious to the fifth force , while dynamical observations are affected and would overestimate the mass of the cluster .",
    "other effects studied in  @xcite include mass - to - light ratios in the local group , rotation curves of galaxies in clusters , and dynamics of rich clusters .",
    "these combine to yield a constraint of @xmath121 , consistent with our assumption of @xmath122 .",
    "this is consistent with generic string compactifications ; if for instance @xmath6 is the radion field measuring the distance between two end - of - the - world branes , @xmath123  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have shown that an interaction between dark matter and dark energy generically mimics @xmath0 cosmology , provided that the observer treats the dark matter as non - interacting . unlike phantom models , the theory is well - defined and free of ghosts .",
    "our model is consistent with current observations provided the scalar potential is sufficiently flat . for our fiducial @xmath124 ,",
    "this translates into @xmath125 .",
    "this is no worse than normal quintessence with tracker potential , where a nearly identical bound follows from observational constraints on @xmath126 .",
    "in fact our scenario is less constrained than other interacting dark energy / dark matter models studied in the literature .",
    "there is no need to introduce a non - interacting dm component , as in  @xcite ; nor does the coupling strength need be much weaker than gravity , @xmath127 , as in  @xcite .",
    "instead , our model allows for a single interacting dm species with gravitational strength coupling to dark energy  @xmath122 . in both cases",
    "this traces back to a difference in attractor solutions .    at",
    "the level of current uncertainties , the model is degenerate with both @xmath1cdm and phantom models .",
    "however , our calculations of luminosity and angular - diameter distances indicate that these models could be distinguished by the next generation of cosmological experiments devoted to the study of dark energy , such as snap , the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst )  @xcite , the joint efficient dark - energy investigation ( jedi )  @xcite , the advanced liquid - mirror probe for astrophysics , cosmology and asteroids ( alpaca )  @xcite , and others .    a dark sector interaction may reveal itself in various ways in the data .",
    "a strong hint would be a preference for @xmath0 when fitting cosmological distance measurements assuming cdm .",
    "another indication is a discrepancy between the clustering matter density at various redshifts and the expected @xmath128 dependence in normal cdm models , which could appear as a discrepancy in the inferred value of @xmath129 .",
    "we also uncovered modifications in the linear matter power spectrum and large - scale structure .",
    "these are primarily due to the attractive scalar - mediated force which enhances the growth of dm perturbations on small scales .",
    "note that the opposite behavior obtains for a phantom scalar coupled to dark matter , resulting in a repulsive scalar force which damps perturbations  @xcite .",
    "as mentioned earlier , non - linear effects are important for the relevant range of scales and would require n - body simulations .",
    "other observational effects that could distinguish our model from @xmath1cdm and phantom include the bias parameter .",
    "since baryons are unaffected by the fifth force , baryon fluctuations develop a constant large - scale bias  @xcite which could be observable . similarly ,",
    "comparison of the redshift dependence of the matter power spectrum , @xmath130 , may be useful to constrain the scale @xmath106 , which varies with @xmath71 .",
    "moreover , it has recently been argued that dark sector interactions could lead to oscillations in the redshift dependence of cluster counts  @xcite . the integrated sachs - wolfe effect",
    "is another mechanism worth studying .",
    "since the present range of our scalar force is comparable to the size of the observable universe , it might account for the observed lack of power on large scales in the cmb .",
