    ". the ground state electron energies in the dots , @xmath12 , may differ .",
    "the states @xmath7 are coupled by nearest neighbor couplings .",
    "the eigenstates @xmath0 and the corresponding energies @xmath2 are thus obtained as the eigenstates of the effective chain hamiltonian ( assuming a single confined state in each dot ) @xcite , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the coupling constant .",
    "this coupling constant is determined by the barrier between the neighboring qds .",
    "the height of the barrier depends on the band edge mismatch between the qds and on the host materials whereas the barrier width is set in the process of growing of the qd stack .",
    "since the stacks of self - organized qds are produced using molecular beam epitaxy @xcite or metal organic chemical vapor deposition @xcite the barrier width ( i.e. inter - dot distance @xmath15 ) is controlled with a high precision up to a single monolayer , so the coupling constant @xmath14 can be assumed to be the same for all pairs of neighboring qds .",
    "we assume the overlap between the wave functions localized in different dots to be negligible , so that @xmath16 .",
    "the inhomogeneity of the qd stack is taken into account by choosing the energies @xmath12 from the gaussian distribution with the mean @xmath17 and variance @xmath18 .",

    "our choice to use the same wave function for all qds which have not necessarily the same ground energy levels can be argued as follows . using the model of quantum harmonic oscillator we can estimate that small differences of the confined energy levels in a qd ( of the order of a few mev ) correspond to very small changes of the parameters of the wave function ( of the order of a few percent ) , so we can approximate wave function of each qd by a gaussian function with constant parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 . on the other hand , when the differences of the qd confined level energies are larger strong localization of an electron on the qd with the lowest energy level occurs , which means that the exact form of the wave functions ( i.e. knowledge of the precise values of parameters ) of other qds become irrelevant , so that in this case we also can use the same parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 for all qds of the chain .    for the bulk electron states , we assume plane waves @xcite orthogonalized to the localized states , as previously proposed for calculating carrier capture rates @xcite .",

    "we will consider two cases : a monochromatic laser light will be described as a classical plane wave field @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the vacuum permittivity , @xmath37 is the high - frequency dielectric constant of the semiconductor , @xmath38 is the amplitude of the electric field of the electromagnetic wave , @xmath39 is a unit vector defining its polarization , @xmath40 is its wave vector ( inside the dielectric medium ) , and @xmath41 is its frequency , where @xmath42 is the refractive index of the semiconductor . on the other hand , for thermal radiation , corresponding to the natural working conditions of a solar cell , the field is @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the annihilation operator for a photon with the wave vector @xmath40 , @xmath28 is the formal normalization volume , and we take into account that the incident solar radiation is propagating into a specific direction , hence its wave vectors are distributed over a very small solid angle around its direction of propagation @xmath45 ( which is represented by the prime at the summation sign ) . for more flexibility of the modeling , we assume also that the radiation is polarized ( the effects of unpolarized radiation can be modeled by averaging over the directions of polarization ) .",
    "in the description of light induced transitions from the confined states to the extended states we assume that the occupation of the latter is negligible , which in a solar cell corresponds to assuming efficient carrier collection .    in the case of classical ( coherent ) monochromatic light with frequency @xmath46 , propagation direction @xmath47 , and polarization @xmath39 , the transition rate from a state @xmath0 to the continuum of extended states is obtained in the usual way from the fermi golden rule @xcite using the interaction hamiltonian with the field given by eq .  ,",

    "this can be written in the form @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the energy density of the electromagnetic wave and @xmath52    in the case of illumination by broad band thermal radiation , we first use the hamiltonian with the quantum field given by eq .   to calculate the fermi golden rule probability of absorption of a photon with a wave vector @xmath40 , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the bose distribution of photon occupations at the temperature of solar black body radiation and the transition matrix elements @xmath55 are given by eq .  .",
    "we note that for radiation propagating in a fixed direction @xmath45 , the overlap integral @xmath56 actually depends only on the frequency , @xmath57 .",

    "the absorption spectrum for a single dot shows only a single maximum with a long tail on the high energy side but already for a few dots it develops a series of additional maxima . as can be seen in fig .",

    "[ fig : beta](a , b ) we show the spectral distribution of the transition rates as a function of the energy of the absorbed photon . comparison with the absorption spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : length ] shows that the qualitative form of these two spectral characteristics is similar but quantitatively the transition rate at higher photon energies is enhanced relative to that at lower energies .",
    "this is due to the very quickly growing spectral densities of the thermal photon field at higher energies ( according to the the planck law ) which enhances the role of higher energy photons ( and , in consequence , the overall absorption of energy in the corresponding spectral range ) .",
    "one should notice that inhomogeneity ( higher values of @xmath84 ) leads to a less structured spectrum with non - vanishing absorption over all the spectral range .    in fig fig .",

    "the result at @xmath85  k includes the thermal distribution of the initial states of the electron . as one can see , the total rate increases as the inhomogeneity grows .",
    "this increase is due to the increasing probability that the electron will localize in a dot with much lower `` on - site '' energy as the qd energy distribution broadens .",
    "this enhances the transition rate because of the growing spectral density of radiation for higher energy differences between the initial and final states . as a function of the chain length ( fig .",
    "[ fig : beta](d ) ) , the total transition rate increases slightly ( up to several % ) for strongly coupled chains at low temperatures and then saturates for @xmath86 .",
    "this increase is mostly due to high - frequency contributions corresponding to the enhanced high - energy absorption features in a qd stack ( cf .",
    "[ fig : length ] ) .",
    "one can notice in fig .",
    "[ fig : beta](d ) that the gain in the total transition rate for strongly coupled dots not only is much larger than for weaker coupling but it is also much less sensitive to temperature .",
    "we have proposed a model which describes electron states and intraband absorption spectra which correspond to the transitions from the qd pseudo - band to the conduction band .",
    "we have studied the absorption spectra as a function of the degree of inhomogeneity , the number of qds in the chain , the inter - dot separation , the temperature and the illumination conditions .",
    "we have shown that the absorption spectrum even of short qd chains ( a few qds ) is dominated by interference effects that leads to the appearance of additional absorption maxima and does not considerably evolve further if the chain length exceeds approximately 10 dots .",
    "the overall transition rate under illumination with black body radiation increases by up to several per cent with the number of qds but also saturates already for a few qds in the chain .",
    "the structured absorption spectrum persists when the inhomogeneity of the qd transition energies is increased up to the values comparable with the magnitude of the inter - dot coupling .",
    "strong coupling between the dots is essential for maintaining the chain absorption features up to high temperatures . on practical side ,",
    "our results show that already a stack of a few qds manifests the absorption features characteristic of qd chains and that these features are stable against temperatures and energy inhomogeneities if the dots are sufficiently strongly coupled .",
    "however , a qd chain shows only a slightly increases absorption as compared to a single dot and the increase of absorption is dominated by high - energy photons , which may lead to competition with the interband absorption .",
