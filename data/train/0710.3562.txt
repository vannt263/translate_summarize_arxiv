    "apart from the intrinsic interest of the knowledge of axial form factors , structure functions or the strange quark content of the nucleon , a proper and precise understanding of various processes induced by neutrino interactions is required in the experimental analysis of background substraction , @xmath3-flux determination and particle identification in the neutrino oscillation experiments .    in the study of the neutrino ",
    "nucleus interaction , we can distinguish several energy regions . at low energies we have quasielastic scattering ( qe ) in which a nucleon is knocked out of the target nucleus .",
    "there has been an strong effort both experimental and theoretical to measure and describe this process @xcite .",
    "the basic ingredient is the relatively well known neutrino nucleon elastic interaction , although nuclear effects like fermi motion , pauli blocking or long range rpa correlations are also needed .",

    ", one pion production becomes relevant .",
    "the knowledge of the elementary process @xmath4 is not so well established .",
    "one of the reasons is the scarcity of data @xcite .",
    "most of the theoretical models assume the dominance of @xmath5 resonance mechanisms @xcite but others also include background terms@xcite .",
    "the major uncertainties of these models appear in the @xmath6 transition axial form factors that are fitted , with some theoretical ansatz to the available data .",
    "it is hoped that new data on single pion production from neutrino experiments at k2k @xcite and miniboone @xcite could help to determine these form factors .    in nuclei",
    ", the description of pion production requires a realistic model to account for the final state interaction ( fsi ) of the pion .",
    "this is usually implemented in montecarlo codes .",
    "however , that is not enough .",
    "it has been shown in several works that also the production mechanisms are modified in the medium .",
    "furthermore , in some particular cases , like the coherent pion production , a quantum treatment of fsi is necessary . in any case",
    ", there is clear progress in our understanding of this reaction and some recent @xcite and coming data @xcite may already put strong constraints on the @xmath7 form factors @xcite .    above these energies , but still below the dis region , new inelastic channels are open and several baryonic resonances beyond the @xmath5 can be excited @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been an important progress in the determination of their vector form factors with the advent of high quality electromagnetic data @xcite .",
    "our knowledge of the axial form factors is , in general , poorer due to the scarcity of experimental information @xcite .",
    "the first of these resonances is the @xmath2 , for which the weak excitation can allow to study the axial sector .",
    "although its main decay channel is to @xmath8 , its contribution to the one pion production cross section has been found to be negligible @xcite because of the strong dominance of @xmath7 mechanisms .",
    "however , the situation can be different for the production of two pions .",
    "this channel starts at invariant masses of the hadronic sector just below the @xmath7 .",
    "however , the @xmath7 does not couple to two pions in @xmath9-wave and thus it is not very relevant at these energies , where only slow pions are produced . on the other hand",
    ", the roper resonance @xmath2 has a sizable decay into a scalar pion pair and it is very wide so that its contribution could be large .",
    "indeed , roper excitation mechanisms are known to play a major role in other two pion production reactions close to threshold , like @xmath10 @xcite or @xmath11 @xcite .    in the weak interaction sector , there exist very few attempts to study the two pion production induced by neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "the older experiments done at cern  @xcite , in the regime of high energy have studied two and three pion production to investigate the diffractive production of meson resonances like @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the later experiments done at anl @xcite and bnl @xcite at lower energies have investigated the two pion production processes , specially in the threshold region , in order to test the predictions of the chiral symmetry of the strong interaction lagrangian .",
    "such studies were theoretically proposed by biswas et al .",
    "@xcite and adjei et al .",
    "biswas et al .  used pcac and current algebra methods to calculate the threshold production of two pions .",
    "on the other hand , the work of adjei et al .  made specific predictions for the threshold production of two pions in a restricted kinematic region using an effective lagrangian incorporating chiral symmetry and its breaking , governed by a free parameter ( @xmath14 ) . imposing these kinematical restrictions ,",
    "the experimental data of anl and bnl were analyzed and compared with adjei et al.results .",
    "however , the model did not include any resonance production and the contribution of the @xmath2 should be taken into account .",
    "furthermore we use an expansion of the chiral lagrangian that includes terms up to @xmath15 , while adjei et al .",
    "kept only terms up to @xmath16 .",
    "now that the pattern of chiral symmetry breaking is well known and the background terms contribution to the threshold production of two pions is fully determined , the process could be used to study the electroweak transition form factors of the roper resonance .    in this paper , we will study the @xmath17 channel close to threshold .",
    "apart from roper resonance contribution , many other background mechanisms , that only involve nucleons and pions , appear and are described by an effective lagrangian .",

    ", the disagreement at @xmath204 gev underscores the need for better experimental data in this channel around neutrino energy @xmath205 gev .     with cuts as explained in the text .",
    "note that there are no contributions from the @xmath2 resonance to this channel .",

    "@xcite.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] , we show our results for the threshold production of two pions in the other channels .",
    "again we only show our results with only background terms and with the full model evaluated using the set 1 of nucleon - roper transition form factors .",
    "the use of different sets gives similar results for the full model calculation .",
    "there is no data in the low energy region ; the limited data available in these channels at higher energies have not been analyzed in the kinematical region of the threshold production of two pions and thus a comparison with our present results is not possible .",
    "to summarize , we have studied the threshold production of two pions induced by neutrinos on nucleon targets using a chiral lagrangian to calculate the nucleon pole , pion pole and contact terms . the contribution from the excitation of the roper resonance ,",
    "@xmath2 has been included .",
    "the vector transition form factors are determined from the available data on the helicity amplitudes of its electromagnetic excitation .",
    "the axial form factors are obtained using pcac and the experimental data on @xmath112 decay .",
    "the @xmath69 dependence of the axial form factor has been assumed to be of the dipole form .",
    "it is found that the roper resonance contributes strongly to the @xmath188 and @xmath206 channels .",
    "its contribution is as important as the contribution of the nucleon , pion pole and contact terms , up to energies of @xmath207 mev .",
    "the resonance contribution is sensitive to the form factors used for the @xmath179 transition , and the experimental data , if available with better statistics for the @xmath188 and @xmath206 channels , could be used for the determination of these form factors . for other channels , as well as for these ,",
    "the theoretical results underestimate the experimental results .",
    "furthermore , physical channels involving @xmath7 production could become relevant at beam energies higher than @xmath208 mev , where the threshold approximation we have assumed in our model would no longer be valid .",
    "nevertheless , the low statistical significance of data does not provide a conclusive test of our model .",
    "availability of improved data , specially from future experiments on neutrino induced two pion production in the region of energies @xmath209 gev will be very useful in the study of the electroweak properties of the @xmath2 resonance .",
