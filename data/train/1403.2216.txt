    "it is in fact possible to generalize parts of our arguments to arbitrary vector fields .",

    "more precisely , this is described mathematically by writing @xmath407 where @xmath408 stands for the lie derivative along @xmath112 . in two dimensions",
    "@xmath18 is a scalar density and using explicit form of the lie derivative gives @xmath409 the first term describes moving along @xmath112 while the second makes @xmath18 behave as a density in cases where the flow defined by @xmath112 does not preserve volume .",
    "in particular this relation guarantees that the total flux is unchanged . in case of translations or rotations",
    "the second term vanishes anyway .",
    "the corresponding vector potential @xmath59 is of course not determined uniquely , but it is most convenient to assume it is dragged in a similar way .",
    "this leads to @xmath410 since @xmath59 is a covariant vector the explicit form in vector notation is @xmath411 the second term represents the required rotation of the vectorial components of @xmath59 .",
