    "@xcite , the shock propagating inside the sn may reach the region of densities relevant for neutrino conversion during the period of neutrino emission .",

    "the study of such effects may provide us with additional constraints for the determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy , the neutrino mixing angle @xmath0 , and neutrino masses .    in ref .",

    "before the shock effects begin , the sn matter density is @xmath43 for @xmath44 the shock effects set in and the matter density is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is defined as @xmath47[\\arcsin(1-r / r_s)]^{1.1}\\ } ,   \\label{f}\\ ] ] and @xmath48 is a typical ratio of the potential across the shock front , @xmath49 which measures the sn matter potential @xmath50 drop from @xmath51 to @xmath52 the sn matter potential is related to the sn electron density @xmath53 by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the avogadro s number and @xmath56 is the electron fraction . in the numerical calculations , we assume @xmath57 . in eqs .",

    "1 the density profile of the sn as a function of the radius at different times . these curves reproduce reasonably well the main features of the shock profiles as shown in ref .",
    "the straight line labelled by @xmath27 is the unmodified density profile given by eq .",
    "( [ rho0 ] ) .",
    "once the shock effects begin , at a given time the shock radius @xmath58 is determined by eq .",

    "@xmath65 the density profile is the unperturbed original form @xmath66 .",
    "the density suffers a sizable discontinuity at @xmath58 . and",
    "therefore the discontinuity is @xmath67 . ] for neutrinos emitted in the region @xmath65 , due to their much higher velocities , which is the order of speed of the light , than that of the shock wave propagation , which is the order of @xmath68 , they are not influenced by the shock effects .",
    "hence the majority of sn neutrinos which are emitted within a 10 second period will be able to semble the whole range of the profile of the sn density under the influence of the shock .",
    "an important consequence of the density modification by the shock wave is that some of the neutrinos can undergo multiple resonance flavor conversion when they traverse the sn .",
    "we consider them below .",
    "let us first consider the neutrino flavor conversion due to the density discontinuity at the shock front @xmath58 .",
    "this crossing probability of the neutrino flavor transformation which we denote as @xmath69 can be determined by the conservation of flavor across the matter potential discontinuity . by a simple calculation , we have @xcite @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are respectively the effective mixing angles in matter immediately before and after the shock front position @xmath58 .",
    "such angles are defined by @xmath73      the msw effects @xcite is the adiabatic or partially adiabatic neutrino flavor conversion in media with locality or time varying matter density .",
    "the main feature is that in a high density medium a flavor is also a mass state which propagates without flavor oscillation , until crossing a resonance where there is a finite probability for flavors change , i.e. , a jump from one mass eigenstate to another . for @xmath0",

    "similarly , one can calculate the expression of the crossing probability @xmath81 at the low resonance region inside the sn .",
    "however , due to the large angle solution of the solar neutrino , @xmath82 .    in the presence of a propagating shock wave ,",
    "the calculation of the global crossing probability , @xmath41 , is not straightforward .",
    "the shock modifies the density profile as discussed in the preceding subsection . within the shock wave and near the shock front",
    "the matter density is no longer monotonically decreasing , but rather goes through a minimum and a maximum .",
    "so the resonance condition can be satisfied possibly as many as three points : @xmath83 it is , of course , possible that there are only two or one resonance points , or even none at all . in the case of three resonance points , which we denote as @xmath84",
    ", two of the points lie below the shock front and the third one beyond the shock front , i , e . , @xmath85 . the crossing probability @xmath75 at @xmath86 , @xmath87 , can be calculated from eq .",
    "( [ ph0 ] ) .",
    "note that although the matter densities are the same at all resonance points as required by eq .",
    "( [ resonance ] ) , their crossing probabilities , as given by eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) , may be different because the slop of the matter density may be different at different resonance points .",
    "the global crossing probability can be expressed in terms of four crossing probabilities @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 .    to obtain the expressions of the global crossing probabilities , we first define four densities : @xmath92 is the resonance density which satisfies eq .",

    "for the inverted mass hierarchy , for a given value of @xmath200 , @xmath199 lies in a band bounded by the curves marked as `` inverted & max '' and `` inverted & min '' , which are obtained by setting the values of both @xmath201 and @xmath33 at their upper and lower bounds , respectively . from this plot , it can be seen that if the value of @xmath199 is away from 2.4 , that is statically significant , the mass hierarchy must be inverted and a band of values of @xmath0 and @xmath200 can be determined .",
    "but it is difficult to determine @xmath0 from @xmath199 alone .",
    "it is interesting to observe that , since the value of @xmath199 falls bound in the limited range of 2.1 - 2.8 , it can serve as a test of the validity of the overall parametrization of the sn explosion mechanism .    for the neutrino - carbon reactions ,",
    "both @xmath192 and @xmath199 can be used to identify the mass hierarchy and obtain information on @xmath0 . in fig .",
    "8a , we plot @xmath192 vs @xmath0 similar to fig .",
    "7 . here for the inverted mass hierarchy , @xmath192 has the constant value 2.4 independent of @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath192 is larger than 2.4 , the mass hierarchy must be normal .",
    "it can also be seen from fig .",
    "8a that @xmath192 depends on @xmath0 sensitively for the normal mass hierarchy and the uncertainties of @xmath192 due to @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 are small . therefore ,",
    "in the case of normal mass hierarchy , we can restrict @xmath0 to a small range of values by measuring @xmath192 .",
    "similar plots are made for @xmath199 in fig .",
    "now for the normal mass hierarchy , @xmath199 is independent of @xmath0 . for the inverted mass hierarchy",
    "@xmath199 varies with @xmath0 and is smaller than 2.4 .",
    "hence we may also be able to identify the mass hierarchy by @xmath199 .",
    "however , as shown in the plot , in the case of inverted mass hierarchy the large uncertainties of @xmath199 due to @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 make it difficult to constrain @xmath0 by @xmath199 .",
    "the daya bay experiment has the sensitivity limit of 0.01 for @xmath202 , i.e. , @xmath197 for @xmath0 .",
    "however , if a sn explosion takes place during the operation of the experiment , it is possible to reach a much smaller value of @xmath0 with the benefit of determining the mass hierarchy by measuring @xmath192 for the neutrino - carbon reactions .",
    "now let us consider the heavy water detector , for an example , used in the previous sno experiment @xcite .",
    "the detector mass was made of 1000 tons of heavy water located in the depth of @xmath203 m.w.e .",
    "we consider only the neutrino - deuterium reactions .",
    "the total number of deuterium is @xmath204 . scaling the experimentally measured energy values from the decay of the muon at rest to the energy scale of sn neutrinos",
    ", one can obtain the effective cross sections of neutrino - deuterium reactions as follows @xcite@xcite : @xmath205 for the charged - current capture , and @xmath206 for the neutral - current capture , where @xmath207 .    in figs . 9a and 9b we plot @xmath192 and @xmath199 of the neutrino - deuterium reactions in analogy with figs .",
    "8a and 8b .",
    "similar to the neutrino - carbon case given in fig .",
    "9a for @xmath192 can be used to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "but it is difficult to pin down the value of @xmath0 .",
    "figure 9b for @xmath199 is similar to fig .",
    "7 and the discussion can be applied to the present situation , with the allowed value of @xmath199 between 1.9 to 2.6 in the case of inverted mass hierarchy .    in the above discussions ,",
    "we have applied our method to three reactions : inverse beta decay , neutrino - carbon , and neutrino - deuterium .",
    "a summary is given in table ii . from this table",
    ", it can be seen that the mass hierarchy may be identified by measuring @xmath192 in the neutrino - carbon reactions and the neutrino - deuterium reactions , and by measuring @xmath199 in the inverse beta decay , the neutrino - carbon reactions , and the neutrino - deuterium reactions .",
    "in addition , in the case of normal mass hierarchy , @xmath192 measured in the channel of neutrino - carbon reactions can provide the most accurate information about @xmath0 . similarly , the present method can also be applied to other neutrino experiments , such as kamland @xcite , minboone @xcite , borexino @xcite , and double - chooz @xcite in the channel of neutrino - carbon reactions . in the future , if a sn explosion takes place within the cosmic distance considered here , it is possible to identify the mass hierarchy and reach a much smaller value of @xmath0 than current neutrino experiments through the measurement of @xmath192 in the channel of neutrino - carbon reactions .",
    "all of our understanding of neutrino properties has been derived in the terrestrial environment , with input from solar neutrinos , and our study of sn neutrinos has been made under the reasonable assumption that the terrestrial properties can be applied unaltered to the extreme conditions of the cosmos , such as those in the sn , e.g. , high temperature , high density , etc .. if an observation of sn neutrinos deviates from the prediction , it will be argued that our picture of sn requires modification .",
    "however , it would be prudent to check if some aspects of the properties of neutrinos may have been modified under the unusual cosmic conditions . in this section",
    "we propose a measurement , the observation of which , can only be attributed to some change of the neutrino property , albeit a very specific one .    since neutrinos",
    ", at least some of the species , have finite masses , their transmitting velocities are smaller than that of light .",
    "then , neutrinos from a sn explosion , while traveling through a large distance to the earth , can experience a delay in the arrival time , which depends on their energies and masses and may be observable @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "suppose a neutrino from a sn , of mass @xmath208 ( in ev ) and energy @xmath32 ( in mev ) , travels over a distance @xmath172 ( in 10kpc ) to the earth , it will experience an energy - dependent time delay of @xmath209 ( in second ) relative to a massless neutrino @xcite : @xmath210 where only the lowest order term in the neutrino mass expansion has been kept . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a method of measuring the neutrino mass is proposed , using the detection of the event number of the delayed sn neutrinos . in the papers ,",
    "a simple model of the luminosities of sn neutrinos was assumed , in the absence of various effects considered in recent sn neutrino studies .",
    "the neutrino luminosities were assumed to have a common step - function cutoff at a fixed time .",
    "this form of luminosities was derived from the argument that the neutrino gravitational redshifts become severe enough only near the sharp cutoff time @xmath211 , where @xmath211 can be determined from the observed time profile of sn neutrinos .",
    "therefore , the luminosities , which are constant before @xmath211 and vanishes abruptly afterward , take the form @xmath212 . in the present work ,",
    "we take into account the full complexity of the neutrino flavor transformation due to the effects of the shock , msw , collective , and the earth matter . also , we consider the time - dependence of the sn neutrino luminosities given in eq .",
    "( [ l ] ) and the uncertainties in the sn neutrino flux parameters given in eqs .",
    "( [ l0 ] ) and ( [ t ] ) .",
    "since the time delay @xmath209 depends on the neutrino mass @xmath208 , we can express the event number of the delayed sn neutrinos as a function of @xmath208 .",
    "therefore , information about @xmath208 can be obtained by detecting the event number of the delayed sn neutrinos .    from ref .",
    "@xcite there are the following neutrino mass bounds @xmath213 for the sn electron antineutrino the averaged energy is @xmath214 , which together with @xmath22 , gives @xmath215 from eq .",
    "( [ dt ] ) .",
    "this time delay of the @xmath9 is much smaller than the time scale of the sn explosion of about @xmath216 . and",
    "it is also too short to be be observable .",
    "similarly , for the electron neutrino @xmath217 , we find @xmath218 , which is again very short and much smaller than the time scale of sn explosion . therefore , unless their effective mass is somehow significantly enhanced , @xmath8 and @xmath9 can be considered as massless for the time delay observation . for the muon and tau neutrinos , according to the oscillation experiments their effective masses in the terrestrial setting will also be bound by @xmath219 because of the much smaller values of @xmath220 and @xmath221 , , @xmath222 , @xmath223 , and @xmath28 , to those of the regular neutrino masses , @xmath224 , @xmath225 , and 3 , by @xmath226 where @xmath227 is the neutrino mixing matrix .",
    "] their time delay will be very small too . in the following",
    ", we will tentatively ignore these terrestrial bounds to form the basis of our proposal for a test of neutrino properties under the cosmic setting of extreme conditions .",
    "after the sn explosion the emission of different flavors of neutrinos lasts for a period of about @xmath216 .",
    "the arrival to the earth of those flavors of neutrinos and antineutrinos whose effective masses are not affected will last about the same period of time .",
    "for other flavors which are affected there may be a delay in the arrival time , depending on the values of their effective masses .",
    "we look for measurements which are sensitive to both charge and neutral current events , such as the detector types of the daya bay @xcite , lvd @xcite , and sno @xcite experiments , which involve the neutrino - carbon and neutrino - deuterium reactions .",
    "the experimental information that these detectors can potentially provide include the event numbers of the electron antineutrino from charged - current reactions and the total event number of all the three flavors of neutrinos from the neutral - current reactions .",
    "we shall assume that the electron neutrino mass is not affected so as to avoid any possibility of influencing the existing result of nucleosynthesis .",
    "but the effective masses of the muon and tau neutrinos might be affected . then , there might be a time delay @xmath228 between the charged - current events and some of the neutral - current events if the muon and tau flavors of sn neutrinos appear to have sufficiently sizable effective masses . denoting the effective mass of @xmath184 ( @xmath229 , @xmath230 , @xmath134 , or @xmath135 ) by @xmath231 , we have @xmath232 where we have dropped the units for @xmath233 , @xmath234 , @xmath32 , and @xmath172 as indicated in eq .",
    "( [ dt ] ) .",
    "@xmath235 is the average time of sn neutrinos of the neutral - current reactions to arrive at the detector and @xmath236 that of the charged - current reactions .",
    "a nonvanishing @xmath233 signalizes a significant larger effective mass for muon or tau neutrino , independent of parameters of the sn and neutrinos .    to gain a sense of how @xmath233 may look like and",
    "how sensitive it is to the effective mass of the muon and tau neutrinos , we have to do some model calculation for quantities which can be measured in a sn neutrino experiment .",
    "we found that such a quantity is available as described below .",
    "we use the charged - current events which are from the electron antineutrino to monitor the events that are not delayed , and the neutral - current events which involve all flavors to measure the possible time delay .",
    "we divide the total neutral - current events into two groups : @xmath237 and @xmath238 , where @xmath237 is the total neutral - current events in accompanying with the charged - current events and are therefore not delayed , and @xmath238 are all the total neutral - current events including both delayed and not delayed .",
    "we define the event number of the delayed @xmath184 plus @xmath239 from the neutral - current events as @xmath240 the quantity to be measured is the new ratio , @xmath241 this ratio is very insensitive to the values of @xmath220 and @xmath221 .",
    "is insensitive to variations of @xmath220 and @xmath221 in a range of 10 and 8 orders of magnitude respectively .",
    "] it should also be remarked that because of the ratio , the effect of the various uncertainties involved , such as the neutrino and sn parameters , will be reduced in @xmath242 .",
    "using the charged current events to monitor the undelayed neutral current events will bypass the question of the uncertainty in the total emission time of sn neutrinos .    since we can not tag the flavor of neutral - current events the information on the masses of the muon and tau neutrinos are correlated .",
    "for the purpose of illustration we assume @xmath229 and @xmath134 to have the same effective mass .",
    "we keep all other features of neutrinos and the sn unchanged . for the neutrino - carbon reactions at daya bay , we plot in fig .",
    "10 two sets of curves which describe @xmath242 as a function of @xmath231 , each for a fixed value of @xmath0 . in fig .",

    "a measurement of @xmath242 can restrict @xmath234 in a distinctive range of values determined by the uncertainties in the sn neutrino temperature and chemical potential . in fig .",
    "10(b ) for @xmath245 , @xmath242 is again shown to be sensitive to @xmath234 for @xmath244 .",
    "the two mass hierarchies overlap for small @xmath234 but fall into well separated regions for @xmath246 .    in figs .",

    "10(b ) , fig .",
    "11(b ) shows that the two mass hierarchies can no long be separated even for @xmath231 greater than @xmath248 .",
    "the method can also be applied to kamlamd , minboone , borexino , and double - chooz in the channel of neutrino - carbon reactions , and the results are similar to those given for the daya bay experiment .",
    "in this paper , we considered the sn shock effects , the msw effects , the collective effects , and the earth matter effects in the detection of type ii sn neutrinos . also , we considered the uncertainties in the neutrino luminosities @xmath3 , their temperatures @xmath4 , and their pinching parameters @xmath5 in the calculation of different flavors of sn neutrinos .",
    "we found that quantities suitably defined in terms of event numbers of different flavors of sn neutrinos are sensitive to the neutrino mass hierarchy , the mixing angle @xmath0 , and neutrino masses .",
    "therefore , it is possible to identify the mass hierarchy , acquire information about @xmath0 , and look into certain neutrino mass patterns of sn neutrinos .",
    "firstly , we defined the ratio @xmath189 as the event number of @xmath8(@xmath9 ) for the charged - current reaction detected after one second over that detected in the first one second , and discussed the dependence of @xmath189 on @xmath0 for different mass hierarchies . with this",
    ", we may identify the mass hierarchy and obtain information about @xmath0 .",
    "this method can be applied to several detector types relying on specific physical processes , including the inverse beta decay ( fig .",

    "( figs . 8(a ) and 8(b ) ) , and neutrino - deuterium reactions ( figs . 9(a ) and 9(b ) ) . from our numerical calculations ,",
    "the mass hierarchy may be identified by measuring @xmath192 in the neutrino - carbon reactions and the neutrino - deuterium reactions , @xmath199 in the inverse beta decay , the neutrino - carbon reaction , and the neutrino - deuterium reactions .",
    "in addition , in the case of normal mass hierarchy , @xmath192 measured in the neutrino - carbon reactions provides the most restrictive information about @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , we can both identify the mass hierarchy and measure @xmath0 from @xmath192 in the channel of neutrino - carbon reactions at several experiments such as daya bay , kamland , minboone , borexino , and double - chooz .",
    "secondly , we defined another ratio , @xmath242 , for the neutral - current reactions , as the event number of the delayed neutrinos over the total event number , with the charge current events as a monitor of undelayed events .",
    "the significance of @xmath242 is that it offers a possibility to detect possible difference between the electron neutrino and its other flavors counterparts , in particular , any significant difference in their effective masses under the cosmic setting of extreme conditions . with the plot of @xmath242 vs @xmath231 , we can study @xmath231 vs @xmath249 .",

    "what we have presented for @xmath242 is a case study with rather restricted input . in case",
    "there is an indication of non - vanishing @xmath242 a detailed refined calculation should be made .    in conclusion , if a sn explosion takes place within the cosmic distance considered here , it is possible to identify the mass hierarchy and obtain information on @xmath0 . with suitable",
