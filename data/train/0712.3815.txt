    "in @xcite a rotation theory is developed for continuous self maps of degree 1 of topological graphs having a unique loop , using the ideas and techniques of @xcite . a rotation theory is usually developed in the universal covering space by using the liftings of the maps under consideration . the universal covering of a graph containing a unique loop is an `` infinite tree modulo 1 '' ( see figure  [ fig : sigma ] ) .",
    "it turns out that the rotation theory on the universal covering of a graph with a unique loop can be easily extended to the setting of infinite graphs that look like the space @xmath3 from figure  [ fig : hatg ] .",
    "these spaces are defined in detail in section  [ subsec : liftedgraphs ] and called _ lifted graphs_. each lifted graph @xmath4 has a subset @xmath5 homeomorphic to the real line @xmath6 that corresponds to an `` unwinding '' of a distinguished loop of the original graph . in the sequel",

    "is the graph @xmath7 , its universal covering is @xmath4 .",
    "[ fig : sigma ] ]     is unwound with respect to the bold loop to obtain @xmath3 , which is a lifted graph .",
    "[ fig : hatg ] ]    given a lifted graph @xmath4 and a map @xmath8 from @xmath4 to itself of degree one , there is no difficulty to extend the definition of rotation number to this setting in such a way that every periodic point still has a rational rotation number as in the circle case .",
    "however , the obtained rotation set @xmath9 may not be connected . despite of this fact ,",
    "it is proven in @xcite that the set @xmath10 corresponding to the rotation numbers of all points belonging to @xmath6 , has properties which are similar to ( although weaker than ) those of the rotation interval for a circle map of degree one . indeed , this set is a compact non empty interval , if @xmath11 then there exists a periodic point of rotation number @xmath12 , and if @xmath13 then for all large enough positive integers @xmath14 there exists a periodic point of period @xmath15 of rotation number @xmath12 .",
    "we conjecture that the whole rotation set @xmath9 is closed . in this paper",
    ", we prove that , when the space @xmath4 is the universal covering of the graph @xmath7 consisting in an interval attached by one of its endpoint to a circle ( see figure  [ fig : sigma ] ) , then the rotation set is the union of finitely many compact intervals .",
    "moreover , all rational points @xmath2 in @xmath9 are rotation numbers of periodic ( mod  1 ) points .",
    "it turns out that the proofs extend to a class of maps on graphs that we call @xmath7-like maps , which are defined in section  [ subsec : sigmalikemaps ] .",
    "a _ ( topological ) finite graph _ is a compact connected set @xmath16 containing a finite subset @xmath17 such that each connected component of @xmath18 is homeomorphic to an open interval .",
    "the aim of this section is to define in detail the class of _ lifted graphs _ where we develop the rotation theory .",
    "they are obtained from a topological graph by unwinding one of its loops .",

    "the class of all lifted graphs will be denoted by @xmath27 .    to simplify the notation , in the rest of the paper we identify @xmath24 with @xmath6 itself . in this setting , the map @xmath28 can be interpreted as a translation by 1 .",
    "so , for all @xmath29 we write @xmath30 to denote @xmath31 .",
    "since @xmath28 is a homeomorphism , this notation can be extended by denoting @xmath32 by @xmath33 for all @xmath34 .    because of ( ii ) , not all infinite graphs obtained by unwinding a finite graph with a distinguished loop are lifted graphs .",
