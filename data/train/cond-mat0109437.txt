    "the recent success in observing quantum degeneracy in ultra - cold atomic fermi gases @xcite stimulates a search for gaseous fermi systems with an achievable temperature of superfluid phase transition .",
    "the ideas based on cooper pairing for a short - range van der waals interaction between atoms @xcite require a simultaneous trapping of at least two different fermionic species , with a rather severe constraint on their relative concentrations .",
    "the situation is different for fermi gases of dipolar particles .",
    "being electrically polarized , these particles interact via long - range anisotropic ( partially attractive ) dipole - dipole forces . in the ultra - cold limit",
    ", the dipole - dipole scattering amplitude is energy independent for any orbital angular momenta @xcite .",
    "this opens prospects to achieve the superfluid pairing in a _ single - component _ fermi gas , where only scattering with odd orbital momenta ( negligible in the case of van der waals interactions ) is present .",
    "these prospects are especially interesting as in single - component fermionic gases the pauli exclusion principle provides a strong suppression of inelastic collisional rates ( see @xcite ) .",
    "hence , one can think of achieving significantly higher densities than in bose gases .",
    "possible realizations of dipolar fermi gases include an electrically polarized gas of polar molecules as they have large permanent electric dipoles .",
    "the creation of cold clouds of polar molecules has been recently demonstrated in experiments with buffer - gas cooling @xcite and in experiments based on deceleration and cooling of polar molecules by time - dependent electric fields @xcite .",
    "another option is to create a gas of atoms with electric dipole moments induced by a high dc electric field @xcite or by laser coupling of the atomic ground state to an electrically polarized rydberg state @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-wave cooper pairing in a polarized dipolar fermi gas has been discussed in @xcite , and the corresponding critical temperature has been estimated by using the standard bcs approach . in this paper",
    "we calculate the exact value of the critical temperature and find the energy and angular dependence of the order parameter . for this purpose",
    "we consider the cooper pairing for all possible scattering channels .",
    "these channels are coupled to each other by the dipole - dipole interaction , and the cooper pairs prove to be coherent superpositions of contributions of all odd angular momenta . in order to find the pre - exponential factor for the critical temperature , we perform the calculations to second order in perturbation theory along the lines of the approach of gorkov and melik - barkhudarov ( gm approach ) @xcite .",
    "we consider a spatially homogeneous single - component gas of fermions having a dipole moment @xmath1 oriented along the @xmath2-axis .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system has the form    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the field operator for fermions , @xmath5 the dipole - dipole interaction , @xmath6 is the angle between the interparticle distance @xmath7 and the @xmath2-axis , and @xmath8 is the chemical potential . in eq.([1 ] ) we omit the contribution of the @xmath0-wave scattering due to the short - range part of interparticle interaction , since this contribution is small in the dilute ultra - cold limit .    for a single - component fermi gas ,",
    "the cooper pairing is possible only in the states with an odd angular momentum @xmath9 . on the other hand ,",
    "the anisotropic character of the dipole - dipole interaction leads to coupling between cooper pairs with different values of the angular momentum .",
    "therefore , the problem of superfluid pairing requires us to consider states with any odd @xmath9 .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath10 of the superfluid transition and the order parameter @xmath11 can be found from the gap equation in the momentum representation @xcite :    @xmath12    here @xmath13 , and we assume the order parameter to be real .",
    "the function @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the fourier transform of the dipole - dipole interparticle interaction potential @xmath16 :    @xmath17    with @xmath18 being the angle between the momentum @xmath19 and the @xmath2-axis .",
    "the quantity @xmath20 originates from many - body effects and is a correction to the bare interparticle interaction @xmath21 .",
    "the leading corrections are second order in @xmath21 and the corresponding diagrams are shown in fig.1 ( see ref .",
    "they describe the processes in which one of the two colliding particles polarizes the medium by virtually creating a particle - hole pair . in 1a",
    "the particle - hole pair then annihilates due to the interaction with the other colliding particle . in 1b , 1c and",
    "1d the hole annihilates together with one of the colliding particles . in 1b and 1c",
    "the particle - hole pair is created due to the interaction of the medium with one of the colliding particles , and the hole annihilates with the other colliding partner . in 1d",
    "these creation and annihilation processes involve one and the same colliding particle .    for temperatures just below @xmath10",
    "the order parameter is small and the gap equation is equivalent to the ginzburg - landau equation for the spatially homogeneous order parameter .",
    "this equation can be obtained by expanding the rhs of eq.([1.1 ] ) in powers of the order parameter @xmath22 :    @xmath23 ,   \\label{2}\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "the occurrence of the cooper pairing is associated with the existence of a nontrivial solution of eq.([2 ] ) for temperatures @xmath26 . in order to find the value of the critical temperature one can neglect the second , nonlinear term in the square brackets in the rhs of eq.([2 ] ) because for @xmath27 the order parameter @xmath28 .",
    "the corresponding linearized gap equation also provides us with the momentum dependence of the order parameter , whereas the nonlinear term determines the absolute ( temperature dependent ) value of @xmath29 .    the integral in eq.([2 ] ) diverges at large momenta .",
    "the divergency can be eliminated by expressing the bare interaction @xmath21 in terms of the vertex function ( scattering off - shell amplitude ) @xmath30 .",
    "this is similar to the well - known procedure of renormalization of the scattering length in dilute gases of bose or fermi particles interacting via short - range forces @xcite .",
    "one may choose any value of @xmath31 , and for simplifying our calculations we select @xmath32 .",
    "then the vertex function @xmath33 obeys the equation    @xmath34    with @xmath35 .",
    "we will confine ourselves to the second order in perturbation theory with respect to @xmath21 . omitting higher order corrections ,",
    "the renormalized linearized gap equation reads    @xmath36    in the dilute ultra - cold limit only small momenta @xmath37 and @xmath38 are important .",
    "we thus have to find the scattering amplitude for ultra - cold particles , in the presence of the dipole - dipole interaction between them .",
    "the anisotropic and long - range character of the dipole - dipole interaction ( @xmath39 ) ensures that in the ultra - cold limit all partial waves give an energy independent contribution to the scattering amplitude @xcite . for any orbital angular momentum @xmath9",
    "one has @xmath40 , where the quantity @xmath41 plays a role of the characteristic radius of interaction for the dipole - dipole potential . for the interparticle separation @xmath42 the potential @xmath43 does not influence the wave function of the relative motion of two colliding particles and",
    "the motion becomes free .",
    "the ultra - cold limit requires particle momenta satisfying the condition @xmath44    the anisotropy of @xmath45 directly couples scattering channels with angular momenta @xmath9 and @xmath46 .",
    "thus , strictly speaking , all even-@xmath9 ( odd-@xmath9 ) channels are coupled to each other , whereas the scattering with odd angular momenta remains decoupled from that with even momenta .",
    "there are two contributions to the scattering amplitude .",
    "the long - range contribution comes from distances @xmath47 and gives @xmath48 for all angular momenta in the incoming and outgoing channels , allowed by the selection rules .",
    "this contribution can be found by using the born approximation .",
    "the short - range contribution comes from distances @xmath49 . for the scattering with even @xmath9 , due to the presence of the @xmath50-wave",
    ", we have again @xmath51 or even somewhat larger because of the so - called shape resonances @xcite . under the condition ( [ limit ] ) ,",
    "the contribution of the @xmath50-wave to the wave function of the relative motion at distances @xmath49 is independent of @xmath0 .",
    "this leads to an energy independent @xmath52 .",
    "however , it depends on a detailed behavior of the interparticle potential at short interparticle distances .",
    "thus , for even @xmath9 one can not make a general statement on the value of @xmath52 .    in the case of identical fermions",
    "only odd orbital angular momenta are present .",
    "then the short - range contribution is much smaller than the long - range one .",
    "we will demonstrate this for the @xmath0-wave on - shell scattering amplitude , omitting the coupling to the channels with other odd @xmath53 .",
    "for @xmath54 and @xmath55 in both incoming and outgoing scattering channels ( @xmath56 is the projection of @xmath9 on the @xmath2 axis ) , the dipole - dipole potential @xmath57 averaged over the angle @xmath58 is equal to @xmath59 . in order to analyze the short- and long - range contributions to the scattering amplitude , we consider the relative motion of particles in a truncated potential @xmath60 for @xmath61 , and @xmath62 for @xmath63 .",
    "the truncation radius @xmath64 is selected such that @xmath65 .",
    "the schrdinger equation for the wave function of the relative motion reads @xmath66    at distances @xmath67 we may put @xmath68 in eq.([schr ] ) .",
    "then for @xmath69 we use the well - known procedure of finding an analytical solution for @xmath70 in power law potentials @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath71 , this gives @xmath72 where the constant term is independent of @xmath73 . at @xmath74",
    "the motion is free and @xmath70 depends explicitly on the scattering phase @xmath75 .",
    "the solution , which for @xmath76 takes the required asymptotic form @xmath77 , at @xmath67 becomes @xmath78 equalizing the logarithmic derivatives of the wave functions ( [ psi1 ] ) and ( [ psi2 ] ) , we immediately obtain @xmath79 and find that @xmath80 for @xmath81 .",
    "the scattering amplitude then proves to be @xmath82 .",
    "the short - range contribution to @xmath83 , that is the contribution from distances @xmath84 , is obtained from this relation by simply putting @xmath85 .",
    "we then increase @xmath64 and make it much larger than @xmath86 . at distances",
    "@xmath87 the potential @xmath88 is much smaller than the kinetic energy term in the lhs of eq.([schr ] ) . for the contribution of these distances to the scattering amplitude",
    "the born approximation gives @xmath89 .",
    "we thus see that the short - range contribution to the scattering amplitude is small as @xmath90 compared to the long - range contribution coming from distances @xmath91 .",
    "this has two important consequences .",
    "first , a detailed shape of the interaction potential is not important for the scattering amplitude as the latter is determined by the long - range contribution .",
    "this contribution is obtained in the born approximation and depends only on the value of the dipole moment .",
    "second , we may include the second order born correction to the amplitude .",
    "this correction is of the order of @xmath92 and still greatly exceeds the short - range contribution .",
    "in the second order born approximation for the off - shell scattering amplitude @xmath93 we have @xmath94 where the first and second terms in the rhs of eq.([6 ] ) are first and second order in @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "the integral for the second order correction to the scattering amplitude in eq.([6 ] ) is formally divergent at large @xmath95 .",
    "this is the same non - physical divergency as in the case of short - range interactions @xcite , and it will be eliminated in the calculations of the order parameter and critical temperature ( see section v ) .",
    "in a quantum degenerate fermi gas characteristic momenta of colliding particles are of the order of the fermi momentum @xmath96 ( @xmath97 is the gas density ) . then , with @xmath41 , the condition ( [ limit ] ) of the ultra - cold limit for interparticle collisions can be written as @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the fermi energy .",
    "the lhs of eq.([sparameter ] ) is the ratio of the mean dipole - dipole interaction energy ( per particle ) to the fermi energy . as in the case of short - range interactions",
    "@xcite , this is a small parameter of the many - body theory .",
    "it is the condition ( [ sparameter ] ) that allows us to omit the contribution of higher order diagrams and use the renormalized gap equation ( [ 4 ] ) .",
    "generally , in dilute fermi gases the critical temperature is exponentially small compared to the fermi energy @xmath100 .",
    "the exponent is inversely proportional to the fermi momentum @xmath101 and is determined by first order terms in @xmath21 .",
    "the account of the second order terms provides us with the pre - exponential factor .",
    "we first calculate @xmath22 to first order in @xmath21 and find the correct exponent in the dependence of the critical temperature on the particle density . for this purpose",
    "we should keep in eq.([4 ] ) only the terms which are first order in @xmath21 .",
    "this is the first term in the rhs of this equation , with @xmath102 .",
    "then , eq.([4 ] ) can be rewritten in the form @xmath103 here  @xmath104 , and @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the density of states at energy @xmath107 .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath8 is equal to the fermi energy : @xmath108 .",
    "the main contribution to the pairing comes from the states near the fermi surface , where @xmath109 . in order to single out this contribution in the rhs of eq.([5 ] ) , we introduce a characteristic energy @xmath110 that obeys the constraint @xmath111 , and is of the order of the fermi energy .",
    "we then divide the integral over @xmath112 in eq.([5 ] ) into two parts : ( a ) the integration of @xmath113 from @xmath114 to @xmath115 , and ( b ) the integration of @xmath116 $ ] from @xmath117 to @xmath110 , plus the integration of @xmath118 from @xmath119 to @xmath114 and from @xmath115 to @xmath120 . in part ( a ) we use the asymptotic formula @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the euler constant . in part",
    "( b ) we replace @xmath123 by the step function ( omitting the unimportant contribution from a narrow interval @xmath124 ) and integrate in parts . as a result , eq.([5 ] ) takes the form @xmath125\\int \\frac{d{\\bf n}^{\\prime } } { 4\\pi } r(\\xi , { \\bf n};0,{\\bf n}% ^{\\prime } ) \\delta ( 0,{\\bf n}^{\\prime } ) + \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{-\\varepsilon _ { f}}^{\\infty}d\\xi ^{\\prime } \\ln \\frac{\\left| \\xi ^{\\prime } \\right| } { % \\overline{\\omega } } \\frac{d}{d\\left| \\xi ^{\\prime } \\right| } \\int\\frac{d{\\bf n% } ^{\\prime } } { 4\\pi } \\left\\ { r(\\xi , { \\bf n};\\xi ^{\\prime},{\\bf n}^{\\prime } ) \\delta(\\xi^{\\prime } , { \\bf n}^{\\prime } ) \\right\\ } ,   \\label{5'}\\ ] ] where the first and second terms in the rhs come from parts ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "one can easily see that the second term in eq.([5 ] ) is small as @xmath126 compared to the first one .",
    "therefore , the second term is only important for the pre - exponential factor in the expression for the critical temperature and will be omitted in this section .",
    "this is equivalent to the commonly used bcs approach where the kernel @xmath127 is replaced by @xmath128 for @xmath129 and by zero otherwise .",
    "putting @xmath130 in eq.([5 ] ) , we obtain the following equation for finding the critical temperature : @xmath131 \\int \\frac{d{\\bf n}^{\\prime } } { 4\\pi } r(0,{\\bf n};0,{\\bf n}^{\\prime } ) \\delta ( 0,{\\bf n}^{\\prime } ) .",
    "\\label{5''}\\ ] ]    the anisotropic character of the scattering amplitude leads to a nontrivial angular dependence of the order parameter @xmath132 . in order to analyze the possibility of pairing we",
    "expand @xmath132 in terms of a complete set of eigenfunctions @xmath133 of the integral operator with the kernel @xmath134 :    @xmath135    the functions @xmath133 are normalized by the condition @xmath136 , and they are labeled by the index @xmath137 in such a way that the eigenvalues @xmath138 .",
    "then eq.([5  ] ) reduces to a set of equations    @xmath139    the appearance of a nontrivial solution for @xmath140 below a certain critical temperature requires the presence of at least one negative eigenvalue @xmath141 . for a single eigenvalue @xmath142 , the critical temperature immediately follows from the condition @xmath143 , and we have @xmath144 and @xmath145 for @xmath146 . in the case of several negative eigenvalues @xmath147 , one has to choose the solution that corresponds to the lowest eigenvalue as it gives the highest critical temperature .    using eq.([2 ] )",
    "one finds that negative @xmath141 correspond to eigenfunctions @xmath148 which are independent of the azimuthal angle @xmath149 .",
    "this means that only spherical harmonics with zero projection @xmath150 of the angular momentum @xmath9 appear in their decomposition . for these functions",
    "the kernel @xmath134  can be reduced to its average over the azimuthal angles @xmath151 and @xmath152 . using eq.([2 ] ) for @xmath153",

    ", we obtain the solutions of eq.([7 ] ) : @xmath159 the lowest eigenvalue  is @xmath160 .",
    "therefore , the angular dependence of the order parameter will be characterized by the function @xmath161 ( see section vi for details ) .",
    "the critical temperature is then given by @xmath162 in the bcs approach the pre - exponential factor ( @xmath110 ) remains undetermined .",
    "one can only argue that it is of the order of @xmath163 .",
    "we thus have @xmath164 in ref .",
    "@xcite the exponent in the expression for @xmath165 is only expressed in terms of the scattering amplitude which should be found from the solution of a set of coupled equations .",
    "the estimate for this exponent in ref .",
    "@xcite takes into account only the @xmath166 scattering channel and contains a numerical error .    in order to find the pre - exponential factor one has to include the contribution from the second term in eq.([5 ] ) , together with the second order corrections to the eigenvalue @xmath167 .",
    "these corrections originate from the second order many - body effects and from the second order corrections to the scattering amplitude , described by the second terms in eqs.([4 ] ) and ( [ 6 ] ) respectively .",
    "we now proceed with the calculation of the pre - exponential factor in the expression ( [ 9 ] ) for the critical temperature .",
    "we first consider the contribution of the second term in the rhs of eq.([5 ] ) , which is logarithmically small compared to the already calculated first term .",
    "for this purpose we specify the value of @xmath110 by the condition @xmath168 then , using eqs.([7 ] ) and ( [ 7.1 ] ) we obtain the following expression for @xmath110 : @xmath169 this definition of @xmath110 immediately leads to eq.([9 ] ) for the critical temperature and allows us to rewrite eq.([5 ] ) in the form @xmath170 @xmath171 where the second term in the rhs is proportional to the small parameter of the theory @xmath172 and can thus be considered as a perturbation .",
    "this follows from the fact that the bracket in this term vanishes for @xmath173 . as a result ,",
    "in contrast to the first term of the rhs , the second term does not contain the large logarithm @xmath174 .    the leading contribution to",
    "the angular dependence of the order parameter on the fermi surface comes from the term with @xmath175 in eq.([7 ] ) : @xmath176 .",
    "therefore , to the leading order in @xmath172 , the solution of eq.([9 ] ) is @xmath177 after substituting this expression into eq.([8 ] ) and performing a numerical integration , we obtain @xmath178 corrections to eqs.([8 ] ) and ( [ 10 ] ) are related to the terms with @xmath179 in eq.([7 ] ) , and from eq.([9 ] ) we find that the quantities @xmath180 . these corrections lead to the relative contribution of the order of @xmath181 to the pre - exponential factor for the critical temperature and hence will be neglected .",
    "we now calculate the contributions from the second terms in eqs.([4 ] ) and ( [ 6 ] ) . as one can see from eq.([7 ] ) , these terms result in the correction for the eigenvalue @xmath167 : @xmath182 the first term in the integrand of eq.([10.1 ] ) originates from many - body effects , and the quantity  @xmath20 is shown diagrammatically in fig.1 .",
    "the analytical expressions for the diagrams in figures from 1a to 1d , read : @xmath183 here @xmath184 , and @xmath185 is the fermi - dirac distribution at zero temperature .",
    "the integrals related to the first term in the rhs of eq.([10.1 ] ) , with @xmath186 , were calculated numerically by using the monte - carlo method .",

    "the total correction to the eigenvalue @xmath167 is then @xmath201 on the basis of eqs.([9 ] ) , ( [ 10 ] ) and ( [ 10.2 ] ) , we obtain the final expression for the critical temperature : @xmath202 it is worth noting that if we include only the @xmath166 scattering channel the exponent in eq.([11 ] ) will be larger by a factor of @xmath203 .",
    "the pre - exponential factor becomes then larger by a factor of @xmath204 .",

    "the expression in the square brackets vanishes as @xmath207 for @xmath208 .",
    "therefore , the main contribution to the integral comes from the region of small @xmath112 , i.e. from @xmath209 close to the fermi momentum @xmath101 .",

    "the anisotropy of the order parameter provides a major difference of the properties of the superfluid dipolar fermi gas from those of the ( two - component ) fermionic gas with the @xmath50-wave pairing due to short - range intercomponent interaction .",

    "for example , excitations with momenta in the direction of the dipoles acquire the largest gap .",
    "in contrast to this , the eigenenergies of excitations with momenta perpendicular to the dipoles remain unchanged .",
    "the properties of collective excitations are also expected to have a nontrivial dependence on the direction of their momenta .",
    "therefore , the response of the dipolar superfluid fermi gas to small external perturbations will have a pronounced anisotropic character .",
    "another distinguished feature of the superfluid dipolar fermi gas is related to the temperature dependence of the specific heat .",
    "well below the critical temperature the single - particle contribution to the specific heat is proportional to @xmath253 , rather than being exponentially small as in the case of the @xmath50-wave pairing .",
    "this follows from the fact that the energy @xmath254 of single - particle excitations has a line of zeros on the fermi surface : @xmath255 for the angles at which @xmath256 , i.e. for @xmath243 and an arbitrary azimuthal angle @xmath257 . as a consequence ,",
    "the density of states in the vicinity of the fermi energy is @xmath258 for @xmath259 .",
    "therefore , at temperatures @xmath260 , the temperature dependent part of the energy of the system is proportional to @xmath261 , and the specific heat is hence proportional to @xmath253 . this contribution is much larger than the one of collective modes which is @xmath262 and is dominant in the case of the @xmath50-wave pairing .",
    "it should also be mentioned that the properties of the superfluid dipolar fermionic gas are different from the properties of the gas with the @xmath0-wave pairing originating from a short - range attractive interaction in the @xmath0 -wave channel .",
    "the reason is that in the latter case the order parameter is isotropic , similarly to the @xmath263-phase of superfluid @xmath264he .",
    "the order parameter of dipolar gases is also different from the order parameter of the @xmath265 phase of @xmath264he where the gap vanishes only at two points on the fermi sphere , i.e. at the poles of the sphere @xmath266 and @xmath267 .",
    "the anisotropy of the order parameter of dipolar gases is similar to that in the polar phase of superfluid liquid @xmath264he , not realized in experiments as it has higher energy than experimentally observed @xmath265 and @xmath263 phases ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for the polar phase the order parameter is also equal to zero on the equator of the fermi sphere ( @xmath243 and an arbitrary @xmath257 )",
    "the situation where the order parameter is zero on one or several lines on the fermi surface is encountered in heavy - fermion compounds ( for a review of possible superconducting phases of heavy - fermion compounds belonging to different crystalline groups see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in these cases",
    "the temperature dependence of the specific heat is also @xmath268 ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite . however ,",
    "from a general point of view , one would expect a different physical behavior of dipolar gases , for example with regard to the frequency and angular dependence of the response .",
    "this is because of the different types of symmetry groups : continuous rotational group for dipolar gases and discrete crystalline group in the case of heavy - fermion materials ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .",
    "our results show prospects for achieving the bcs transition in single - component trapped gases of dipolar particles , in particular for ( electrically polarized ) fermionic polar molecules . as has been shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , for trapped gases the bcs transition temperature is close to that of the 3d uniform gas with density @xmath97 equal to the maximum density in the trap .",
    "this requires @xmath252 to be much larger than the maximum trap frequency , which is generally the case for achievable temperatures .",
    "therefore , we will use eq.([11 ] ) for estimating @xmath252 in the trapped case .",
    "we first compare our equations ( [ tbcs ] ) and ( [ 11 ] ) with the well - known bcs formula ( see e.g. @xcite ) for the two - component fermi gas with short - range attractive intercomponent interaction . in the latter case",
    "the exponent is expressed in terms of the @xmath50-wave scattering length @xmath269 and is equal to @xmath270 .",
    "we then see that our dipole - dipole scattering with odd orbital angular momenta is equivalent to having the @xmath50-wave scattering length @xmath271 accordingly , eq.([11 ] ) takes the form @xmath272 qualitatively , the result of eq.([scattlength ] ) is more or less expected , since @xmath273 turns out to be of the order of the characteristic radius of the dipole - dipole interaction , @xmath274 , introduced in section iii .    for most polar molecules the electric dipole moment ranges from @xmath275 to @xmath276 debye . for example , the dipole moment of fermionic ammonia molecules @xmath277nd@xmath278nd@xmath278 ) and fermionic ( @xmath277nd@xmath278 ) ammonia molecules were recently trapped at temperatures of around @xmath279 mk in the rijnhuizen experiment @xcite . ]",
    "is @xmath280 d , and we have the effective scattering length is @xmath281  .",
    "this is larger than the scattering length for the intercomponent interaction in the widely discussed case of two - species fermionic gas of @xmath282li . from eq.([stc ] ) we find that the bcs transition temperature for the single - component nd@xmath278 dipolar gas will be larger than @xmath283 nk at densities @xmath284 @xmath285 .",
    "another interesting example is a linear fermionic molecule hcn which has dipole moment @xmath286 d , and the corresponding effective scattering length @xmath287  .",
    "remarkably , in ultra - cold single - component fermionic gases one can hope to reach much higher densities than in bose gases and think of achieving the bcs transition for a smaller effective scattering length @xmath288 .",
    "the reason is that inelastic decay processes will be strongly suppressed due to the pauli exclusion principle . for two identical fermions with momentum @xmath0 of the relative motion",
    ", the pair correlation function behaves as @xmath289 at interparticle distances @xmath290 smaller than the de broglie wavelength @xmath86 .",
    "generally , inelastic processes occur at short interparticle distances @xmath291 which in the ultra - cold limit are much smaller than @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , two - body inelastic collisions will be suppressed as @xmath292 compared to the bosonic case where the pair correlation function is of order unity at any @xmath290 outside the region of interparticle interaction . as a result ,",
    "in a non - degenerate gas of fermions the inelastic rate decreases with temperature and is suppressed as @xmath293 , where the energy @xmath294 . in a quantum degenerate fermi gas",
    "a characteristic momentum of particles is of the order of @xmath235 and the suppression factor is @xmath295 .",
    "the suppression of two - body inelastic collisions in fermionic gases was first found for spin relaxation in atomic deuterium @xcite .",
    "for the rate of 3-body recombination we expect even a stronger suppression , i.e. by a factor of @xmath296 for the non - degenerate gas , and by a factor of @xmath297 in the regime of quantum degeneracy ( @xmath298 ) .",
    "the suppression factor for inelastic collisions in single - component quantum degenerate fermi gases , @xmath299 , is of the order of @xmath300 .",
    "the distance @xmath291 is commonly smaller than @xmath301  .",
    "therefore , even at densities @xmath302 @xmath285 one expects the suppression of two - body inelastic rates at least by 2 orders of magnitude , and the suppression of 3-body recombination by 4 orders of magnitude .",
    "this allows us to think of achieving densities @xmath302 @xmath285 or somewhat larger , which is by more than a factor of @xmath303 higher than the densities currently reached with ultra - cold bose gases .    for @xmath302 @xmath285 ,",
    "the bcs transition temperature @xmath10 is in the nanokelvin or microkelvin regime for dipolar fermionic gases with an effective scattering length @xmath304 ranging from @xmath305 to @xmath306  .",
    "such values of @xmath304 one easily finds in molecular gases .",
    "for example , fermionic @xmath307n@xmath308o molecules have dipole moment @xmath309 d and eq.([scattlength ] ) gives @xmath310  .",
    "interestingly , the effective scattering length @xmath311 of the order of several tens of angstroms can be obtained in gases of atoms with induced dipole moments @xcite . by using a high dc electric field ( @xmath312 v / cm ) @xcite",
    "one can induce permanent atomic dipole moments close to @xmath313 .",
    "the same values of @xmath314 one obtains for the time averaged dipole moment of an atom , induced by a stroboscopic laser coupling of the ground atomic state to a rydberg state @xcite .",
    "the corresponding scattering length @xmath304 can then be close to @xmath306  , and one can think of achieving the bcs transition in such single - component atomic dipolar gases at densities @xmath302 @xmath285 and temperatures @xmath315 nk .",
