    "the interaction of a relativistic electron beam ( reb ) with a plasma is a subject of relevance for many fields of physics ranging from inertial fusion to astrophysics @xcite .",
    "this interaction is also relevant , among others , for fast ignition scenario ( fis ) @xcite where the precompressed deuterium  tritium ( dt ) core of a fusion target is to be ignited by a laser  generated relativistic electron beam .",
    "the reb quickly prompts a return current so that one eventually has to deal with a typical two  stream configuration which is subjected to various electromagnetic instabilities .",
    "much effort have been devoted in the last years to investigate these instabilities @xcite , whether it be the two ",
    "stream @xcite , the filamentation @xcite or weibel @xcite instabilities .",
    "these instabilities are usually analyzed by linearizing the relativistic vlasov or fluid and maxwell equations .",
    "then , the response of the linearized equation to a perturbation is investigated and one eventually finds some unstable self  excited modes . at this stage",
    ", the orientation of the wave vector @xmath4 of the excitations plays an important role . choosing a wave vector parallel to the beam velocity @xmath3 yields the two  stream unstable modes which are of electrostatic nature and therefore characterized by wave and electric field vectors both parallel to the beam propagation direction . on the other hand , choosing a wave vector normal to the beam yields the purely transverse filamentation unstable modes .",
    "they are mostly electromagnetic , purely growing , and develop preferentially in the plane normal to the beam .",
    "the exploration of the much less investigated intermediate orientations has brought a very important result by that showing that the strongest instability suffered by the system is eventually to be found for an oblique wave vector @xcite .",
    "this most unstable mode is a mixture of the two  stream and the filamentation instabilities but it is not damped as the last two ones .",
    "for example , the maximum two  stream growth rate is reduced by a factor of @xmath9 in the relativistic regime , while the most unstable mode only decreases by a factor of @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the beam relativistic factor .",
    "the filamentation growth rate varies as @xmath12 and may be reduced , even canceled , by a transverse beam temperature @xcite whereas the most unstable mode is quite insensitive to temperatures as long as they are nonrelativistic @xcite .    in general beam ",
    "plasma instabilities have been studied in detail for many physical situations including the interaction of the cold , warm , inhomogeneous or anisotropic electron or ion beams with cold , warm , magnetized , unmagnetized , inhomogeneous or anisotropic plasmas , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite for detailed bibliography ) . in this paper",
    ", we present a study of the effects of a radiation field ( rf ) on the interaction of reb with a plasma .",
    "more specifically our objective is to study the beam  plasma instabilities in a laser irradiated plasma which , to our knowledge , has not been discussed in the literature .",
    "the principal motivations of the present paper are the researches on the topic of the fis for inertial confinement fusion @xcite which involves the interaction of a laser  generated reb with a hot plasma .",
    "although the concept of the fis implies an overdense plasma and the propagation of a relativistic electron beam from the border of a pre  compressed target to the dense core occurs without crossing the laser beam , the target plasma is assumed to be parametrically excited by the rf through high harmonics generation .",
    "in addition , a promising inertial confinement fusion scheme has been recently proposed @xcite , in which the plasma target is irradiated simultaneously by intense laser and ion beams . in both situations",
    "the presence of the rf can dramatically change the main features of the standard ( i.e. when the laser is off ) beam  plasma instabilities .",
    "previously the interaction of charged particles with plasma in the presence of the rf has been a subject of great activity in the contexts of the stopping power @xcite ( see also references therein ) and other processes of interest for applications in optics , solid  state , and fusion research .",
    "in particular , the analytical calculations @xcite as well as the particle  in  cell ( pic ) numerical simulations @xcite show that the propagation and the subsequent stopping of the charged particles would be essentially affected by the parametric excitations of the plasma target by means of laser irradiation .",
    "it is well known that in general in the absence of the charged particle beams the laser irradiated plasma is subjected to the parametric instabilities @xcite . therefore in the present context",
    "it is expected that the above mentioned beam  plasma unstable modes developed in a plasma irradiated simultaneously by laser and electron beams are parametrically coupled to each other and are not , in principle distinguishable .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we outline the kinetic formulation for the interaction of the reb with a laser irradiated plasma . the full electromagnetic response of the plasma is considered .",
    "the general linear dispersion relations are derived in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , which are studied for two particular cases in secs .",
    "[ sec:4 ] and [ sec:5 ] with transversal and parallel configuration of the polarization vector of the rf with respect to @xmath4 , respectively . furthermore ,",
    "assuming nonrelativistic laser intensities only the lowest ( zero , first and second ) harmonics of the electromagnetic fields are considered .",
    "the obtained dispersion equations are investigated numerically in sec .",
    "[ sec:6 ] .",
    "the results are summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec:7 ] , which also includes discussion and outlook . in appendix",
    "[ sec : app0 ] we consider the standard ( in the absence of the rf ) stable and unstable modes of the beam  plasma system in a cold  fluid approximation .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the frequencies and the growth rates of these modes at large and small @xmath7 are considered . in appendix",
    "[ sec : app1 ] , we provide some technical details for an evaluation of the sum containing bessel functions . an equation describing the evolution of the amplitude of the parametrically excited plasma waves and involving all excited harmonics is derived and discussed in appendix  [ sec : app2 ] .",
    "in this section , we consider the main aspects of the interaction of the relativistic electron beam ( reb ) with a homogeneous , collisionless , and unmagnetized plasma in the presence of high  frequency radiation field ( rf ) , @xmath13 . here",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath14 are the amplitude and the frequency of the rf .",
    "the problem is formulated using the perturbative treatment , and includes the effects of the rf in a self  consistent way .",
    "the rf is treated in the long  wavelength limit , and the plasma particles ( electrons and ions ) are considered nonrelativistic .",
    "these are good approximations provided that ( 1 ) the wavelength of the rf ( @xmath15 ) is much larger than the debye screening length @xmath16 with @xmath17 the thermal velocity of the electrons and @xmath18 the plasma frequency , and ( 2 ) the quiver velocityof the electrons in the rf ( @xmath19 ) is much smaller than the speed of light @xmath20 .",
    "these conditions can be alternatively written as ( 1 ) @xmath21 , ( 2 ) @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the rf intensity . as an estimate in the case of dense plasma , with electron density @xmath24 @xmath25 , we get @xmath26 w/@xmath27 .",
    "thus the limits ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are well above the values obtained with currently available high  power rf sources , and so the approximations are well justified .",
    "furthermore we consider an underdense plasma with @xmath0 .",
    "the dynamics of the beam  plasma system is governed by the relativistic and nonrelativistic vlasov kinetic equations for the distribution functions of the reb @xmath28 and the plasma @xmath29 ( where @xmath30 indicates the plasma species ) , respectively , as well as by the maxwell equations for the electromagnetic fields .",

    "moreover , we consider an ultrarelativistic electron beam with @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the beam drift velocity , and therefore the influence of the rf @xmath52 on the beam is ignored in the kinetic equation for the distribution function @xmath53 .    for sufficiently small perturbations , we assume @xmath54 ( with @xmath55 ) , where @xmath56 and @xmath57  are the equilibrium distribution functions of the plasma species @xmath39 and the beam in an unperturbed state , respectively .",
