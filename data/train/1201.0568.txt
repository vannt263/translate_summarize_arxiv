    "the desire to understand the properties of the faintest radio source populations has led to numerous surveys pushing to ever fainter levels .",
    "there are now a large number of deep and wide area radio surveys available , such as the australia telescope large area survey ( atlas ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , the cosmic evolution survey ( cosmos ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the atesp survey @xcite , the phoenix deep survey @xcite , and many others @xcite . the bright radio source population ( @xmath1mjy )",
    "is well studied , and is predominantly composed of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) @xcite . at fainter flux densities ,",
    "star - forming galaxies ( sfgs ) begin to dominate the radio source population , particularly into the @xmath2jy regime @xcite .",
    "understanding these faint radio source populations is essential for understanding galaxy evolution , the role of star formation , agn and the relationship between the two .",
    "the use of multiwavelength data to complement radio surveys is vital in order to distinguish between agn and star formation processes as the origin of the radio emission down to the faintest flux densities , although there is likely also a composite population at these faint levels @xcite .",
    "the relative proportions of these two populations will have an effect on the average radio spectral index ( @xmath3 ) , where s is the measured flux density and @xmath4 is the observer s frame frequency . ] as a function of flux density , and at the faintest flux densities , core - dominated agn may be more prevalent , and may flatten the average spectral index to @xmath5 .",
    "conflicting evidence has arisen over the nature and properties of sources at frequencies below 1.4ghz , particularly of their spectral index properties , and whether there is a flattening of the average spectral indices for faint ( @xmath0mjy ) radio sources .",
    "@xcite found sources with fluxes less than a few millijansky had an average spectral index which was flatter than that of the brighter radio sources ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "similarly , @xcite found a flattening of the average spectral index between 325mhz and 1.4ghz for 1.4ghz selected radio sources with @xmath0mjy , and angular sizes @xmath7 .",
    "they found though , that the spectral indices steepen again at the faintest flux density end of the 20 cm survey ( @xmath8mjy ) .",
    "in contrast , in the deepest radio field , the lockman hole @xcite , no flattening of the spectral indices between 610mhz and 1.4ghz was seen for flux densities s@xmath9jy .",
    "a flattening of the average spectral indices implies that there is a flat or inverted spectrum population of sources at these millijansky flux densities , at fluxes fainter than where the steep spectrum star - forming population emerges ( @xmath10mjy ) .",
    "investigating the millijansky and microjansky radio source populations at different frequencies allows us to investigate this suspected flattening of the average spectral indices , and the population of sources causing the flattening , particularly if we can fill in the frequency regime from very low frequencies ( @xmath11mhz ) up to 1.4ghz .",
    "it is necessary to understand the spectral index properties of these faint radio sources for many reasons , such as the @xmath12-@xmath3 relation , used to find the most distant radio galaxies @xcite , identifying young radio agn , such as gigahertz peaked spectrum ( gps ) and compact steep spectrum ( css ) sources @xcite or determining the emission mechanism in radio galaxies , whether it is from star formation , or the central agn @xcite .",
    "here we present radio observations at 843mhz in the elais - s1 field , for which we have complementary 1.4 and 2.3ghz data from atlas that we can use to investigate the possible spectral index flattening at a frequency nearer to the ubiquitous 1.4ghz radio surveys .",

    "atlas currently contains @xmath42 radio sources , and we estimate we will have @xmath43 radio sources following final analysis of new observations completed in 2010 from atca with the compact array broadband backend ( cabb ; * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "the 2.3ghz image has a lower sensitivity , with an rms noise level of @xmath44jy in the central @xmath29deg@xmath24 and @xmath45jy over the entire field .",
    "we find only 576 radio sources have a well - defined counterpart at 2.3ghz , mainly because the resolution is @xmath41 times coarser at this frequency than at 1.4ghz as a consequence of the compact configuration of atca used for these observations .",
    "for the purposes of this paper and catalogue , we use the cross - matches by ( * ? ? ? * z11 ) , where we take the 1.4ghz sources matched to the poorer resolution 2.3ghz data , and extract the fluxes from these images for each source .",

    "to obtain low - radio frequency ( 843mhz ) data within atlas , we used the molonglo observatory synthesis telescope ( most ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "the cdfs field ( centred at ra = @xmath48 and dec=@xmath49 ( j2000.0 ) ) was not observed , due to strong radio frequency interference ( rfi ) that increased with lower elevation .",
    "the data reduction pipeline for most data is highly automated and reliable .",
    "unfortunately , the telescope was subject to severe rfi at the time of our observations .",
    "the process to remove the rfi required manual identification and excision of the affected data .",
    "once completed , we were able to re - run the data pipeline , and produce final cleaned images .",
    "seven of our 31 observations were subject to rfi that we were unable to remove completely , and these were not included in our final imaging .",
    "the remaining 24 images were added together in miriad , first by re - gridding the images to ensure a common astrometry and pixel grid , and then using the task imcomb to combine the images .",
    "the final image has an rms sensitivity of @xmath50mjy , a higher value than expected due to the presence of low - level rfi that could not be excised .",
    "we catalogue sources down to a @xmath51 level of 3mjy .",
    "the final image is shown in figure  [ fig : mostimage ] with the approximate borders of the atlas 1.4 and 2.3ghz mosaics overlaid .",
    "the most image was subject to two kinds of artifacts , grating rings and radial spokes . due to the nature of the telescope design and observing mode ,",
    "these artifacts are technically difficult to remove .",
    "the artifacts remain in our image , and due care was taken to ensure all objects in our final catalogue were not spurious sources associated with the artifacts .",
    "an in - depth discussion of these artifacts is given in @xcite .",
    "source finding for the final most image was done using the task sfind @xcite in miriad .",
    "this produces a catalogue of source positions , peak and total flux density and errors , plus the attributes of the gaussian fits for each source .",
    "the final catalogue contains 325 radio sources , after removal of @xmath52 spurious sources associated with the grating rings and radial spokes .",
    "the spurious sources were identified and removed by visual inspection ( most lay directly on a strong radial spoke or diffraction ring ) , and by comparison to the sydney university molonglo sky survey ( sumss ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) images ( see  [ sec : fluxdist ] for details ) .",
    "each most atlas source was identified in the sumss images with a low signal - to - noise source that was below the detection level of the sumss catalogue .",
    "the most image is larger than the atlas survey region , so our catalogue encompasses a larger number of sources in total than we subsequently analyse together with the other atlas data .",
    "we use the process outlined in @xcite to calculate the errors associated with our measured flux densities , and use equation 5 of @xcite with one small modification : + @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the total integrated flux density , @xmath25 is the rms error in the image at the source location , and @xmath55 is the total error on the integrated flux density .",
    "we use @xmath56 as the sum of the squares of the instrumental and pointing errors as given in m08 , instead of @xmath57 as given in @xcite .",
    "we have used the more conservative estimate of these errors as given by m08 , due to the calibration accuracy of most being comparable to that of atca .",
    "the final most catalogue was positionally cross - matched to the combined 1.4 and 2.3ghz catalogue produced by z11 , that included the relevant swire and optical data . as mentioned previously in ",
    "[ sec : atlas ] , only 576 of the 1276 1.4ghz radio sources in elais have a reliable single 2.3ghz counterpart , whilst 460 have no counterpart , and 240 are blended or poorly fitted sources ( where the 2.3ghz counterpart encompasses multiple 1.4ghz sources ) . from our cross - matching ,",
    "105 most sources were matched to single sources in the z11 catalogue .",
    "another 30 most sources were matched to confused or blended sources from z11 , and 31 most sources were found to have multiple isolated z11 sources matched to a single most source .",
    "the resolution of the most image , @xmath58 , is much coarser than the resolution of the 1.4ghz image ( @xmath59 ) , and the 2.3ghz image ( @xmath60 ) . to determine accurate spectral indices across the three frequencies , it is necessary to convolve the atlas 1.4 and 2.3ghz images to the same size as the most beam to ensure the recovered flux for sources at all frequencies includes any emission extended on scales up to those consistent with the most beam .",
    "figure  [ fig : resol ] shows an example of a complex source from the atlas 1.4ghz catalogue in greyscale in the three radio frequencies , to highlight the differences in resolution . in figure  [ fig : resol1 ] , the same source is shown after convolving the 1.4 and 2.3ghz images to the same resolution as the most image .",
    "although convolution removes most of the small scale structure visible in the original atlas 1.4ghz image , it ensures we are detecting emission from the same spatial region from each source .    for consistency , we used sfind to detect sources within the convolved 1.4 and 2.3ghz images .",
    "this allows us to measure errors on our flux densities that are consistent for the three images , which is important for producing accurate spectral indices and associated uncertainties . rather than rejecting blended sources entirely",
    ", we account for them carefully in our catalogue .",
    "these are single or point sources in the 843mhz most image ( and the 1.4 and 2.3ghz convolved atlas images ) that encompass multiple atlas 1.4ghz sources from the m08 catalogue ( figure  [ fig : complex ] ) .",
    "the m08 flux densities for these sources reported in our catalogue are the summed values of the individual m08 1.4ghz flux densities . as the contribution to the total flux density from each individual component within a blended source can not be determined , we treat them as a single entity for the purpose of the current analysis , even though they may be physically unrelated .",
    "we include these sources in our analysis for completeness , but caution that their spectral indices should not be considered as accurate estimates of those for the underlying source components",
    ".      to ensure our measured 1.4 and 2.3ghz flux densities from the convolved , coarser - resolution , images were robust , we compared these to the flux densities in m08 and z11 .",
    "we find that our measurements in the images convolved to a resolution consistent with the most image tend to systematically overestimate the 1.4ghz flux densities compared to m08 , and underestimate the 2.3ghz flux densities compared to z11 .",
    "the issue at 2.3ghz arises from negative clean bowls around sources in the original image .",
    "these artifacts give rise , after convolution , to our observed systematic decrease in flux density .",
    "the 2.3ghz beam size ( @xmath60 ) is close to that of our most images ( @xmath58 ) , and the bulk of the sources are unresolved , meaning that there is likely to be little flux missed on extended scales .",
    "consequently , we choose to use the flux densities estimated by z11 in the original 2.3ghz image for our spectral index estimates .    at 1.4ghz ,",
    "the difference in resolution from the most image is sufficient that we need to use the flux densities from the convolved image .",
    "the flux density overestimate compared to m08 , which is limited to the fainter sources ( @xmath61mjy ) , is typically of the order of 10% .",
    "this exists for clearly unresolved sources , which should be identical before and after convolution .",
    "this issue is associated with side - lobes from the radio sources in each individual telescope pointing , below the level to which the image has been cleaned , being summed in the convolved image . while this is a small effect , with a minimal impact on our derived spectral indices ( quantified below ) , we can make an empirical correction that minimizes any impact further still .",
    "this is implemented through a least - squares fit of our convolved flux densities against those of m08 , and scaling our convolved flux densities using this fit to be consistent with those of m08 .",
    "this accounts for the flux - density dependence of the imaging systematics while retaining contributions from any real extended flux components , and at the same time , minimizing any possible overestimate of the flux density .",
    "this correction typically results in a change of only @xmath62 .",
    "the impact on our derived two - point spectral index estimates of potential remaining flux density uncertainties at 1.4 and 2.3ghz of @xmath20 is @xmath630.1 .",
    "this uncertainty is included in our estimates of spectral index errors below , by being added in quadrature with the flux density errors ( given by equation  [ eq : error ] ) .",
    "another effect of the convolution is that most objects classified as radio doubles , triples , or core - jet morphology by m08 , appear as one most object ( single or blended ) .",
    "only two core - jet morphology sources appear slightly elongated in the direction of the jet in the most and convolved 1.4 and 2.3ghz images .    due to the lower resolution of the most image ,",
    "there are 61 instances where there are atlas sources within the beam for a most radio source .",
    "these 61 most sources correspond to a total of 144 atlas m08 1.4ghz sources . of the 61",
    ", 30 sources were classified as blended by z11 due to having multiple 1.4ghz sources within the 2.3ghz beam ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the remaining 31 are classified as blended in this paper due to multiple 1.4 or 2.3ghz sources within the most beam .",
    "the cross - matched 1.4ghz atlas source ( positionally closest to the most radio position ) is generally bright while the second , blended , source contributing to the flux density is typically much fainter ( @xmath64mjy ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the majority of such blended sources are likely to have little contribution to the most flux density from the secondary component , and the spectral index estimate for the blended sources can be considered as that for the primary atlas counterpart , even though the uncertainties on this estimate will clearly be larger than the formal uncertainties provided in our catalogue .",
    "blended sources are flagged in the catalogue .",
    "for blended sources in our convolved images , which were not classified as blended sources by z11 , the flux densities from separate sources in the atlas z11 catalogue are summed .",
    "a source is defined as being part of a blended object if the 1.4ghz radio position lay within an ellipse the size of the gaussian used to find the total flux density in the convolved image .",
    "an example of a blended source is shown in figure  [ fig : complex ] where the cross - matched atlas counterpart is in the centre of the most source , and the blended object is within the most synthesized beam .",

    "this object has a rest - frame luminosity of l@xmath97whz@xmath16 , calculated from the observed convolved 1.4ghz flux density .",
    "this implies an upper limit on the star formation rate of @xmath98yr@xmath16 , assuming all the radio emission is from star formation .",
    "however , it has an overall steep spectral index of @xmath99 , which suggests that the source of the radio emission is a low - luminosity agn . for this source @xmath100 ,",
    "consistent with the idea that the radio emission is primarily from the agn .",
    "s1160 is hosted by a star - forming spiral galaxy , shown in figure  [ fig : s707]c , at a redshift of @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "the radio emission is clearly associated with star formation , as the radio contours trace the star formation in the spiral arms of this galaxy .",
    "however , the radio position of the source is offset from the galaxy centre , assigned as the location of the brightest peak in the complex radio structure ( m08 ) .",
    "the radio luminosity of this source is l@xmath102whz@xmath16 which results in an upper limit on the star formation rate of @xmath103yr@xmath16 ( if all radio emission is due to star formation ) .",
    "the optical morphology of this galaxy is very similar to the swire morphology , with a clear spiral structure .",
    "the optical host galaxy has magnitudes from the supercosmos science archive , although these magnitudes should be treated with caution , as it is a large , relatively nearby galaxy and measuring accurate magnitudes in an automated fashion for such sources is difficult due to their complex structure .",
    "the supercosmos magnitudes are @xmath104 , @xmath105 and b@xmath106 .",
    "the optical spectrum is also indicative of star formation .",
    "s1160 is detected in all five of the swire bands , with a @xmath107 .",
    "this @xmath108 value is still consistent with the source being either a sfg or an agn , and it most likely there is a non - negligible contribution to the radio emission from star formation in this source .",
    "the radio flux of this object is interesting , as it has a similar flux density between 843mhz and 1.4ghz ( s@xmath109mjy compared to s@xmath110mjy or s@xmath111mjy ) , but drops rapidly away to s@xmath112mjy .",
    "this gives a spectral index @xmath113 and @xmath114 , with an overall spectral index of @xmath115 .",
    "this spectral shape is more indicative of agn activity , but given the radio morphology and the fir constraints , the radio emission from this object is likely a combination of star formation and agn activity .",
    "high redshift radio galaxies are often found by identifying radio sources with steep or ultra steep radio spectra ( @xmath116 ) , via the well - known @xmath12-@xmath3 relation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ; ) .",
    "this trend was first noticed in the early 1980s , when it was found that the fraction of radio sources optically identified on optical plates tended to have the steepest radio spectra .",
    "s1256 is an isolated point source , with @xmath117mjy and @xmath118mjy , that is not detected in the 2.3ghz atlas image , with a spectral index @xmath119 .",
    "following z11 , using the 3@xmath25 detection limit of 300@xmath2jy , an upper limit on the spectral index is found to be @xmath120 , which suggests that this source is possibly an ultra - steep spectrum source , and therefore at high redshift .",
    "further radio imaging and flux density measurements would be necessary to confirm s1256 as an ultra - steep spectrum source .",
    "s1256 has no optical counterpart or confirmed redshift , but is detected in the swire 3.6 and 4.5@xmath2 m bands .",
    "its flux densities in these bands are low ( @xmath121jy and @xmath122jy ) .",
    "the infrared morphology is point - like and is shown in figure  [ fig : s1256 ] .",
    "another possible cause of this steep spectrum is variability ; where the radio source has faded away since the 1.4ghz observations were completed , and before the 2.3ghz observations began .",
    "further observations would also be necessary to confirm whether variability is the cause of the ultra - steep radio spectrum .",
    "we have presented a new catalogue of 843mhz radio sources , cross - matched to atlas at 1.4 and 2.3ghz , and explored the properties of this catalogue with spectral index as a function of flux density .",
    "our results do not support the hypothesis that there is a significant flattening of the spectral index with decreasing flux density values .",
    "however , we can not rule out the possibility without further , deep radio data at different radio frequencies . our analysis of the distribution of steep and flat spectrum sources with redshift",
    ", luminosity and infrared flux density indicates that most of the sources in our most atlas catalogue are agn , inferred from the spectral index and infrared properties .",
    "an initial sample of faint css sources in atlas has also been selected , with their basic properties explored .",
    "we will explore the properties of the css sample and the most atlas selected gps sources in depth in future work , and compare and contrast this faint sample to our bright sample @xcite .",
    "the spectral index properties of atlas radio sources across a wide range of frequencies will also be explored in future work , with the aim of distinguishing between the proportions of the populations of low - luminosity , and/or core - dominated agn and sfgs driving this effect .",
    "we would also like to thank our referee , rogier windhorst , for his extensive and thorough comments on this paper .",
