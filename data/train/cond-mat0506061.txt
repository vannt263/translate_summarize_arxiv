    "quantum impurity models were introduced in the context of dilute magnetic moments in metals and are based on the notion that important aspects of the physics of extended systems can be captured by spatially local processes .",
    "indeed , the reduction of a complicated many - body problem to the study of a _ single _ quantum degree of freedom coupled to a simplified environment can be an important step in understanding more complex physical situations .",
    "impurity models form the basis for the investigation of lattice systems containing local moments ",
    "these turn out to be extremely rich , displaying various phenomena such as heavy - electron quantum coherence , glassiness , and quantum phase transitions .",
    "in addition , simpler yet interesting quantum effects that take place at the level of a single magnetic moment can also be successfully described using ( oversimplified ) single impurity models  @xcite .",
    "the fermionic kondo effect , i.e. , the screening of an extra magnetic moment by conduction electrons , is certainly the hallmark of this single - impurity approach , but other aspects like local non - fermi liquid behavior and boundary quantum phase transitions  @xcite have also been put forward .    in general",
    ", single - impurity models can serve as an excellent testing ground for novel techniques and physical paradigms that may be helpful in the more complicated case of extended or dense impurity systems . in this respect , recent work based on the so - called pseudogap ( or gapless ) kondo and anderson models , in which conduction electrons obey a semi - metallic density of states that vanishes as @xmath0 ( @xmath4 ) , has shown interesting promises .",
    "indeed , this problem features a plethora of non - trivial properties , which can be elegantly captured by _ controlled _ fermionic renormalization group ( rg ) techniques  @xcite .",
    "powerful non - perturbative numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) simulations  @xcite were able to confirm the success of the analytical approach .",
    "in particular , recent work  @xcite has exposed that all fixed points appearing in these pseudogap models can be accessed perturbatively after identifying the value of the dos exponent @xmath5 that corresponds to their associated lower - critical or upper - critical `` dimension '' .",
    "while the fixed points of the pseudogap spin-1/2 kondo and single - orbital anderson models are now understood in this language , here we are interested in certain extensions of these models for which numerical data is also available : the case of a spin-1 impurity has been investigated in the extensive work of gonzalez - buxton and ingersent  @xcite , and has shown interesting yet unexplained properties .",
    "we note that the physics of spin-1 kondo models can be realized in multilevel quantum dot systems , and theoretical predictions for transport quantities reflecting the singular fermi liquid behavior of underscreened kondo spins in a metallic host @xcite have been put forward @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "our objective is twofold : first , we will generalize the theories for the critical fixed points , which are already present in the spin-1/2 pseudogap kondo model , to the @xmath6 situation , following refs .  .",
    "this includes two types of fixed points , one occuring at particule - hole ( p - h ) symmetry and being controlled at small @xmath5 , and the other present away from p - h symmetry and captured near @xmath7 using a general mapping onto an effective interacting resonant level model .",
    "second , we describe the physics of the _ additional stable _ fixed point which emerges at particle - hole symmetry , due to the instability of the strong - coupling symmetric fixed point for @xmath8 . analyzing the leading relevant perturbation , we will be able to capture this non - fermi phase by a mapping onto an effective ferromagnetic spin @xmath2 model with singular exponent @xmath3 .",
    "technically , we will perform one - loop perturbative rg calculations together with suitable @xmath1-expansions @xcite to determine thermodynamic quantities ; the results compare favorably with the numerical data obtained in ref .  .",
    "the present work also illustrates the broad applicability of the general field - theoretic tools , developed in refs .",
    ", in a more complicated setting .",
    "the bulk of the paper is organized as follows : we start by presenting the spin-1 kondo model with a given pseudogap density of states ( sec .  [",

    "we will finally conclude the paper and discuss some open questions related to the pseudogap kondo model .",
    "the pseudogap kondo model ( for a review , see ref .  )",
    "originates from the question of how a magnetic moment reacts to the coupling to an electronic bath which has depleted weight at the fermi level , and is of interest to various condensed - matter systems such as @xmath9-wave superconductors , graphite , and semiconductors .",
    "the basic physical idea is that the possibility of observing a kondo effect is weakened by the lack of low - energy states , which results in various quantum phase transitions controlled by the strength of the kondo interaction , the amount of particle - hole symmetry breaking , and obviously the shape of the electronic density of states .",
    "we will model the latter by the simplified form @xmath10 which has an algebraic dependence in energy characterized by the number @xmath4 ( the standard kondo model corresponds to @xmath11 ) .",
    "here @xmath12 is the half - bandwidth and @xmath13 .",
    "the kondo model is characterized by an antiferromagnetic coupling @xmath14 to this fermionic bath , and possibly a potential scattering term @xmath15 .",
    "it reads @xmath16 in standard notation , and the subscript @xmath17 stands for `` bare '' physical quantities and operators , in view of the later rg calculations . for @xmath18",
    "the model is p - h symmetric , and @xmath15 tunes the amount of p - h asymmetry . in the following",
    "we will be concerned with the case of a spin-1 operator @xmath19 and want to analyze the various fixed points of this model .",
    "the comprehensive numerical study of gonzalez - buxton and ingersent  @xcite has exposed that the model  ( [ dos]-[kondo ] ) displays several zero - temperature phases , separated by boundary quantum phase transitions .",

    "@xmath33 , scr becomes unstable as well , so that an asymmetric cousin of the critical point , acr , exists and controls the quantum phase transition between lm and an asymmetric strong - coupling ( asc ) fixed point .",
    "acr is associated to finite values @xmath34 and @xmath35 of both the kondo coupling and the potential scattering term .",
    "the numerical simulations of ref .   have also established the behavior of several observables , such as the impurity contributions to the entropy and to the curie susceptibility , for the various fixed points . whereas the trivial cases ( lm , ssc , asc ) are readily understood , all intermediate - coupling fixed points ( scr , nfl , acr ) correspond to _ fractional _ values of both the ground state degeneracy and spin , and",
    "can not be understood on the basis of an independent electron picture .",

    "in this section we analyze the particle - hole symmetric spin-1 pseudogap kondo model ( [ kondo ] ) , with @xmath20 .",
    "we start with the weak - coupling rg which allows to capture the scr fixed point for small @xmath5 .",
    "then we consider an expansion around the symmetric strong - coupling fixed point ",
    "this will lead us to an effective ferromagnetic kondo model with singular density of states which we use to describe the physics of the stable nfl fixed point .",
    "the study of the regime with small kondo coupling and particle - hole symmetry was done by withoff and fradkin  @xcite for @xmath24 .",

    "the correlation length exponent is @xmath42 and @xmath11 can be interpreted as lower - critical `` dimension '' for the phase transition .",
    "these results can be expected to persist for @xmath6 , since the beta function for the kondo problem is known  @xcite to be independent of the impurity spin value @xmath43 . however , as we are interested in computing physical observables at scr , which do differ from their @xmath24 counterparts , we will proceed with a complete rg analysis for @xmath6 as well .",
    "we only sketch here the intermediate results , while details on the derivation can be found in appendix  [ app1 ] .",
    "the analysis is based on a representation of the spin 1 by a triplet of abrikosov fermions , @xmath44 : @xmath45 where the hilbert space constraint @xmath46 is enforced @xcite using a chemical potential @xmath47 .    to proceed with the rg scheme , we relate the bare coupling constant and field , @xmath14 and @xmath44 , to renormalized quantities , @xmath40 and @xmath48 ( which bear no index to shorten the notation within renormalized perturbation theory ) : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a renormalization energy scale .",

    "the rg beta function is obtained by the condition that the bare kondo coupling is scale invariant , i.e. @xmath55 , which gives from  ( [ barej ] ) : @xmath56 inserting  ( [ zf])-([zj ] ) into this expression proves that the beta function in the @xmath6 case is still given by eq .",
    "( [ betaj ] ) , as expected .",
    "we also note that p - h asymmetry is irrelevant at this fixed point , with @xmath57 ( where @xmath58 is the dimensionless potential scattering term ) .      the impurity contribution to the entropy",
    "is obtained as the difference of the total entropy and the entropy of the electron bath alone .",
    "its @xmath59 value represents a measure of the impurity ground state degeneracy . for the scr fixed point it turns out that corrections to the lm value are extremely small @xcite : @xmath60",

    ", we consider in the first place the vicinity of the ssc fixed point . indeed",
    ", the renormalization flow sketched from the numerical solution demonstrates that the strong - coupling fixed point is unstable , which is quite curious at first thought .",
    "indeed , at large @xmath71 , the spin 1 is partially screened by the fermions at site @xmath72 , leaving a remnant effective spin @xmath2 . applying the nozires - blandin argument",
    "@xcite we see that an effective ferromagnetic coupling @xmath73 is then generated between @xmath74 and the electrons @xmath75 sitting on the site near @xmath76 ( above , @xmath77 is the typical hopping between @xmath76 and @xmath75 , and we assumed a chain representation of the electronic bath ) .",
    "naively we would then expect ssc to be stable .",
    "this is _ not _ the case , because at particle - hole symmetry the green s functions of the above electrons are related through : @xmath78 which shows that the fermions @xmath75 have an effective density of states @xmath79 , with @xmath80 .",
    "thus , the effective hamiltonian near ssc is a ferromagnetic spin-1/2 kondo model with a _ negative _ dos exponent .",
    "interestingly , this model was studied before in ref .  , and was found to display a stable intermediate - coupling fixed point . to see this",
    ", we note that the beta function for @xmath81 reads @xmath82 this yields a stable fixed point at @xmath83 , which is allowed since the effective coupling is ferromagnetic ! in our original language , this is the nfl fixed point , which controls now a whole phase with non - trivial properties , and is a unique feature of the @xmath8 pseudogap kondo model . in particular , the above arguments show that this fixed point is located at @xmath84 .",
    "the nfl fixed point is unstable with respect to particle - hole asymmetry , with @xmath85 , a situation which will be discussed in sec .",

    "we know that the correction to the entropy at a particle - hole symmetric withoff - fradkin type of fixed point is as small as @xmath61",
    ". however , we are now expanding around a strong - coupling fixed point and not with respect to a free spin @xmath6 .",
    "since the impurity entropy is defined relative to the decoupled ( @xmath88 ) limit , we have to take into account the contribution at ssc ( @xmath25 ) , which contains a @xmath89 term due to the underscreened spin @xmath2 , and depends on @xmath5 as well  @xcite , due to the singular nature of the resonant level limit ( although the ssc fixed point is trivial ) .",
    "we obtain finally @xmath90 as anticipated numerically ( table  i ) .",
    "we have to follow the same argument as above , and sum the contribution of the strong - coupling fixed point , @xmath91 ( see  @xcite ) as well as the non - trivial correction due to the stable @xmath2 ferromagnetic fixed point with exponent @xmath92 , which is  @xcite @xmath93 .",
