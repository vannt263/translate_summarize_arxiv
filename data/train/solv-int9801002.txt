    "hirota bilinear difference equation ( hbde ) @xcite plays the central role in the study of integrable nonlinear systems .",
    "this single equation embodies infinite number of integrable differential equations which belong to the kp - hierarchy as shown by miwa@xcite,@xcite .",
    "it characterizes algebraic curves@xcite .",
    "it appears as a consistency relation for the laplace maps on the discrete surface@xcite .",
    "it is satisfied by string correlation functions in particle physics@xcite .",
    "it is also satisfied by transfer matrices of some solvable lattice models@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "solutions to hbde , called @xmath0 function , are known@xcite@xcite to form a grassmann manifold of infinite dimensions . on this space of solutions a bcklund transformation acts and generates the @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "this large symmetry is the origin of integrability of the system .",
    "the scheme of the bcklund transformation can be seen most easily if we convert hbde into a pair of linear homogeneous equations .",
    "it was first found by hirota in @xcite and then represented in a manifestly symmetric form under the bcklund transformations in ref.@xcite .",
    "the coupled linear equations describe the behaviour of a wave function under the influence of gauge potentials .",
    "the compatibility condition for the wave function to solve the coupled equations requires the gauge potential to satisfy hbde .",
    "the situation is similar to the inverse scattering method .",
    "the difference from the ordinary inverse method is that every solution to the linear equations also fulfills the same nonlinear equation satisfied by the gauge potential .",
    "this fact owes to the remarkable symmetry under the exchange of the wave function and the gauge potential , which we called the dual symmetry in @xcite .",
    "hence , by solving the linear system of equations iteratively we obtain a series of solutions to the nonlinear equation .",
    "we call this scheme of finding new solutions to a nonlinear equation , a linear bcklund transformation ( lbt ) .    an interesting application of this scheme was found and described in @xcite .",
    "the authors showed that it can be used to generate bethe ansatz solutions to certain class of solvable lattice models . in order to uncover the meaning of the correlation between the solvable lattice models and the hbde , it is desireble to formulate lbt such that the symmetries of this scheme can be seen from both sides . from this point of view",
    "we like to discuss , in this paper , a symmetric generalization of lbt .",
    "the hbde is a highly symmetric equation under the exchange of lattice variables .",
    "the linear equations discussed in @xcite , however , do not possess this symmetry . in ",
    "3 we derive a symmetric version of the lbt associated with hbde",
    ". we will show in  4 that we can generalize this scheme to lattice space of arbitrary dimension .",
    "corresponding to this generalization we obtain a large number of nonlinear equations which can be solved by the lbt method .",
    "the hbde turns out to be a special case of this scheme .",
    "let us begin with writing the hirota bilinear difference equation ( hbde)@xcite for a function @xmath2 of discrete variables @xmath3 : @xmath4 where @xmath5 are arbitrary complex parameters .",
    "this is a very simple and highly symmetric equation . in order to show how the lbt generates solutions to @xmath6 , we follow the argument of ref.@xcite , but in a different notation convenient later .",
    "we consider the following coupled linear problems : @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 are functions of @xmath3 and @xmath10 are constants .",
    "the shift operator @xmath11 acts to all functions on the right by changing @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "hbde @xmath6 emerges from the compatibility condition of this set of linear equations @xmath14=0 .",
    "{ \\label{eqn:[nabla , nabla]}}\\ ] ] in fact , if we impose the condition @xmath15 to the gauge potentials , this operator relation turns to @xmath16 since the left hand side is a difference of the quantity in the brace , this quantity itself must be a constant . by adjusting the parameters as @xmath17 , and putting the constant @xmath18",
    "we obtain the hbde .",
    "an important observation is that the linear equations @xmath19 are symmetric under the exchange of the role of the gauge potentials @xmath20 and the wave function @xmath21 .",
    "this owes to the fact that under the same constraints for the guage fields @xmath20 s , @xmath19 can be also written as @xmath22 if we define @xmath23 and @xmath24 it is not difficult to convince ourselves that the linear equations @xmath25 for the new wave function @xmath20 can be solved only if the new gauge potential @xmath21 satisfies @xmath6 , the same equation satisfied by @xmath20 .",
    "this is what we call dual symmetry in @xcite .",
    "the linear bcklund transformation works as follows : starting from a particular solution to hbde , say @xmath26 , as a gauge potential we solve the linear problem @xmath19 .",
    "one of its solutions , which we call @xmath27 satisfies the hbde because it can be regarded as a potential of the coupled linear equations @xmath25 which are nothing but another expression of @xmath19 .",
    "the set of coupled equations @xmath25 should have solutions other than @xmath26 . let us call it @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath28 must also satisfy hbde , because @xmath19 has @xmath27 as a solution , hence it is compatible .",
    "now we can repeat the same argument starting from @xmath28 to obtain new solution @xmath29 to hbde , and so on .",
    "this is an auto bcklund transformation since @xmath20 s and @xmath21 s are solutions to the same equation . by starting from the simplest solution @xmath30 in the case of @xmath31 in @xmath6 ,",
    "for instance , we obtain a series of soliton solutions explicitly in this method .",
    "( 160,60 ) ( 0,0 )    the hbde is highly symmetric by itself , in contrast to its continuous reductions , such as the kdv equation , toda lattice equation , sine - gordon equation etc .. the corresponding linear version of hbde , @xmath19 and @xmath25 , however , are not symmetric . in this section , we like to derive complete set of linear equations which recover the symmetries possessed by hbde .",
    "first we examine the symmetries of the hbde . from @xmath6 hbde",
    "relates functions defined on the six lattice sites @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 , which form an octahedron in the three dimensional lattice space .",
    "connecting these corners of octahedrons forms a face centered cubic ( _ fcc _ ) lattice .",
    "hence dependent variables of hbde reside on _ fcc _ lattice , rather than a simple cubic lattice .",
    "indeed the vectors @xmath35 ,  @xmath36,@xmath37 in fig.1 are the primary translation vectors of _",
    "the hbde possesses point group symmetries which transform an octahedron to itself .",
    "it includes the inversion @xmath38 , which changes the sign of the variables @xmath3 , and the mirror reflections @xmath39 which exchange the triangles @xmath40 and @xmath41 in fig .",
    "the linear bcklund transformation represented in the form of @xmath19 , however , is not symmetric under the group transformation .",
    "the purpose of this section is to make it symmetric .",
    "first we notice that the potential field @xmath42 appears in @xmath19 as a gauge field in the form of covariant shift operators @xmath43 and @xmath44 defined on two edges of the triangle @xmath45 in fig .",
    "2 . similarly",
    "the field @xmath46 is associated with the triangle @xmath47 . on the other hand from @xmath25",
    "we learn that the fields @xmath48 and @xmath49 are associated with the triangles @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively , which are obtained from @xmath45 and @xmath47 via inversions with respect to the origin . hence two equations @xmath19 and @xmath25 are related each other by the inversion @xmath38 .",
    "in other words the inversion is realized by the dual symmetry .",
    "the rest of the point group symmetry requires potential fields associated with @xmath52 and @xmath53 to exist .",
    "let us call them @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "in order to make the symmetry manifest it is convenient to introduce the following set of derivatives @xmath56 they represent the gradients along the normal to the surfaces @xmath57 . in terms of these operators",
    "the point symmetry transformations can be expressed as @xmath58 applying @xmath59 s to @xmath19 successively we obtain , up to coefficients , the following six pairs of equations @xmath60    among the twelve equations of @xmath61 we notice that , corresponding to each triangle of the octahedron , there are three equations which connect two edges of the same triangle by the gauge fields . for instance",
    "the set of equations @xmath62 determine the triangle @xmath52 .",
    "for the consistency of these equations they must be the same .",
    "we can resolve this problem if we adopt the following conditions to the gauge fields : @xmath63 using the fact that @xmath64 we can write @xmath61 as @xmath65 for all even permutations of ( 1,2,3,4 ) . here",
    "we used the notation @xmath66 to mean that @xmath67 acts only to the functions in the bracket . in this expression",
    "it is obvious that , for a given @xmath68 , three equations with different choices of @xmath69 are the same equation .",
    "therefore we have only four different equations , which we can write as @xmath70 we have recovered coefficients @xmath71 in this expression . they are free unless we specify the values of @xmath72 in hbde .",
    "this is the symmetrized lbt which we were looking for and is symmetric under the @xmath59 transformations .",
    "the symmetric lbt @xmath73 possesses the @xmath59 symmetry as we required . from the analogy of the correspondence between @xmath19 and @xmath25 , the inversion symmetry , which has not been imposed so far ,",
    "should be included if the dual symmetry under the exchange of @xmath20 and @xmath21 holds .",
    "in fact if we multiply the shift operator @xmath74 from the left to the @xmath68th equation of @xmath73 , it becomes @xmath75 these are exactly the equations we obtain from @xmath73 by the inversion transformation @xmath38 of @xmath76 .",
    "therefore @xmath77 itself is the totally symmetric lbt which we expected .",
    "now we will show how hbde arises from this set of equations .",
    "writing @xmath73 explicitely we have , up to the coefficients , @xmath78 since this is a homogeneous linear equation the determinant of the coefficient matrix must vanish . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the matrix is anti - symmetric , that is , the coefficients satisfy @xmath79 . in this case",
    "the determinant is the square of pfaffian , hence the solvability condition turns out to be @xmath80 in this way the hbde is reproduced .",
    "our symmetric lbt @xmath73 possesses the symmetries of the three dimensional _ fcc _ lattice space .",
    "the fourth derivative @xmath81 , however , plays a different role in @xmath73 from others .",
    "this owes to the fact that there are only three independent variables needed to characterize the four surfaces @xmath82 .",
    "this also prevents us to extend the space to higher dimensions .",
    "we like to show , in this section , that the symmetric lbt @xmath73 can be rewritten in a manifestly symmetric form in the four dimensional lattice space if we introduce a parameter @xmath83 which specifies the order of bcklund transformations .",
    "moreover it also enables us to generalize the linear equations to arbitrary dimensional lattice space .    instead of considering two different kinds of fields we associate the parameter @xmath84 to @xmath20 and @xmath85 to @xmath21 and",
    "define a new function @xmath86 by @xmath87 we also introduce new variables @xmath88 s with @xmath89 by @xmath90 @xmath91 it is not difficult to convince ourselves that the operations of @xmath92 is equivalent to the operation of @xmath93 , where @xmath94 means @xmath95 for all @xmath96",
    ". hence the symmetric lbt @xmath73 can be written as @xmath97 we notice that @xmath98 is totally symmetric for all variables @xmath99 .",
    "the introduction of the fourth variable causes nothing to the contents of the equations .",
    "it , however , enables us to generalize equations to higher dimensional lattice space .",
    "we like to show in the rest of this paper that the generalized equations also provide bcklund transformation scheme which generates solutions to new nonlinear difference equations .    for the convenience we define @xmath101 @xmath102f,\\qquad \\tilde g_{ij}(f)=a_{ij}\\exp\\left[-\\sum_{l=1}^n\\partial_l+\\partial_i+\\partial_j\\right]f.\\ ] ] then the @xmath103 dimensional lbt and its dual are @xmath104 they are the same equation but written differently .",
    "the bcklund transformation of the system @xmath105 and @xmath106 proceeds in a way similar to the lbt of hbde , which was discussed in  2 . for the wave function @xmath107 to be a solution of the homogeneous equation @xmath105",
    ", the potential @xmath20 must satisfy @xmath108=0 .",
    "{ \\label{eqn : det g(f)=0}}\\ ] ] this is a nonlinear difference equation of @xmath20 . at the same time",
    "the solvability condition of @xmath106 requires @xmath109=0 .",
    "{ \\label{eqn : det g(g)=0}}\\ ] ]    @xmath110 and @xmath111 are the nonlinear equations to be solved and generalize @xmath112}})$ ]",
    ". since @xmath110 and @xmath111 are not the same equation in general , the transformation may not be auto bcklund transformation . in the case of @xmath113 ,",
    "these two equations are identical and coincide with the square of hbde , as we have seen above . hence @xmath110 and @xmath111 are generalization of hbde to @xmath103 dimensional lattice",
    ". notice that at every step of the bcklund transformation the value of the parameter @xmath83 is changed by one . since @xmath83 specifies a hyper plane in the @xmath103 dimensional lattice space , the bcklund transformation propagets fields on one plane to the next .    before closing this paper",
    "let us remark briefly the connection of the present results with other works .",
    "a generalization of hbde to higher dimmensional lattice space has been discussed in @xcite . in their paper",
    "the equation itself is bilinear and is satisfied by the same @xmath0 functions of hbde .",
    "it is a natural extention because the space of solutions to the kp - hierarchy itself is symmetric under the choice of three variables out of infinite number of variables @xmath114 .",
    "we have checked that all soliton type of solutions to the higher dimensional hbde also satisfy our symmetric lbt .",
    "moreover we have proved that there exists a solution which satisfies our trilinear equation but does not satisfy any of bilinear hirota equations extended to the four dimensional lattice .    an integrable trilinear partial differential equation ( pde )",
    "was discussed in @xcite , which has a connection with the broer - kaup system .",
    "generalization to multilinear pde was also studied in @xcite and the painlev properties were examined . the authors claim that no bilinear form corresponding to them has been found . since the equations considered in these references are not differnce but differential equations , we need further investigation to see the connection of our work with theirs ."
