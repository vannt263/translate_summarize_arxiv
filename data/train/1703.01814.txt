    "<S> single crystals of the sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1-ru eutectic system are known to exhibit enhanced superconductivity at 3  k , in addition to the bulk superconductivity of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 at 1.5  k. the 1.5-k phase is believed to be a spin - triplet , chiral @xmath2-wave state with the multi - component order parameter , giving rise to chiral domain structure . in contrast , the 3-k phase is attributable to enhanced superconductivity of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 in the strained interface region between ru inclusion of a few to tens of micrometers in size and the surrounding sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the dynamic behavior of nb / ru / sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 topological superconducting junctions , in which the difference in phase winding between the s - wave superconductivity in ru micro - islands induced from nb and the superconductivity of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 mainly governs the junction behavior . </S>",
    "<S> comparative results of the asymmetry , hysteresis and noise in junctions with different sizes , shapes , and configurations of ru inclusions are explained by the chiral domain - wall motion in these topological junctions . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , a striking difference between the 1.5-k and 3-k phases is clearly revealed : the large noise in the 1.5-k phase sharply disappears in the 3-k phase . </S>",
    "<S> these results confirm the multi - component order - parameter superconductivity of the bulk sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 , consistent with the chiral @xmath2-wave state , and the proposed non - chiral single - component superconductivity of the 3-k phase . </S>"
