    "quantum state conversion between optical and mechanical modes of cavity has also been studied actively @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that , in the strong optomechanical coupling regime of operation , if the optomechanical coupling is quantum coherent , the optical and mechanical modes are exchanged with the frequency proportional to the optomechanical coupling coefficient @xcite .",
    "this effect can be applied in the design of optical quantum memories and transducers which transfer the quantum state of light from one frequency to the other @xcite .",
    "the storage time of optomechanical quantum memories is limited to @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the mechanical decay rate of the oscillator .",
