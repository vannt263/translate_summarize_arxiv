    "following the pioneering work of nesterov and nemirovskii @xcite , it is known that a significant collection of convex sets are representable as linear sections or projections of the cone of positive semidefinite matrices ( or semidefinite cone for short ) .",
    "a classification has been proposed in @xcite , and advanced optimization modeling software such as yalmip @xcite exploits this knowledge to generate semidefinite programming problems from general convex programming problems , thus allowing the use of powerful interior - point algorithms based on self - concordant barrier functions @xcite .",
    "the dictionnary proposed in @xcite is far from being comprehensive , however , and further efforts are required to identify convex sets which can be efficiently represented via the semidefinite cone .",

    "let @xmath0 be a bivariate polynomial of degree 4 , a quartic , and let @xmath1 be the corresponding algebraic curve .",
    "alternatively , we can use the homogenization @xmath2 , defined in the projective plane @xmath3 , and such that @xmath4 and @xmath5 . algebraic curve ( [ set ] ) can be defined equivalently in the projective plane as @xmath6 see the appendix for more information on algebraic sets in the projective plane .",
    "let @xmath7 denote the convex hull of curve @xmath8 , a semi - algebraic set .",

    "the @xmath17 are called lifting variables , or liftings for short , and the set is obtained by projecting the feasible set of a linear matrix inequality ( lmi ) .    note",
    "that lifting variables are necessary in the above description , already in the particular case when @xmath18 is a convex set .",
    "indeed , a generic line passing through set @xmath9 cuts its boundary @xmath8 at real points only twice , which is less than the degree of @xmath19 , and this implies that @xmath9 is not rigidly convex in the sense of @xcite .",
    "it follows that @xmath9 can not be represented without lifting variables ( @xmath20 ) , or , equivalently , as a linear section of the semidefinite cone .",

    "similarly , the problem of finding a representation with a minimum number of lifting variables seems to be open .    since projections of lmis are convex semialgebraic sets , and the essential difficulty when building semidefinite representations seems to be singularities ( points at which the gradient vanishes ) , one may be tempted to conjecture that convex regions delimited by higher degree smooth curves admit an exact semidefinite representation .",
