    "the galactic halo has long been considered a single component . however , evidences in the past few decades have indicated that it may be more complex @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite confirmed the existence of a two - components halo , analyzing a large sample of calibration stars from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) dr5 @xcite . according to carollo et al .",
    "the galactic halo consists of two overlapping structural components , an inner and an outer halo .",
    "these components exhibits different spatial density profiles , stellar orbits and stellar metalicities .",
    "in particular the inner - halo stars show a small ( or zero ) net prograde rotation around the center of the galaxy .",
    "outer halo stars possess a clear retrograde net rotation .",
    "the theory of galaxy formation in a lambda cold dark matter ( lcdm ) universe predicts galactic stellar halos to be built from multiple accretion events starting from the first structures to collapse @xcite .",
    "halos , composed of both dark and baryonic matter , grow by merging with other halos . while the gas from mergers and accretions loses its energy through cooling and settles into a disk , the non dissipative material ( accreted stars and dark matter ) form a halo around the galaxy . in a lcdm universe , a dark matter halo big enough to host the milky way contains 300+/-100 subhalos @xcite ( such a large number of subhalos is related to the so - called  missing satellites problem ",
    ".    there is significant evidence of past accretions into the milky way @xcite , and therefore we will accept the scenario that the milky way halo has been formed by subhalos accretion and we focus on possible origin of a retrograde ( counter - rotating ) outer stellar halo , defined as the set of stars orbiting around the galaxy at large distance from the disk plane , say @xmath1 kpc : @xcite found that this distance separates the inner and the outer halo . it is expected that such halo is made of stars stripped from merging or disrupted satellites of low mass ( @xcite ; for a detailed study of accreting events onto a milky - way like halo , see also @xcite ) . however , from cosmological simulation , prograde and retrograde mergers are approximately equally likely @xcite .    in order to determine if , and in what condition , we can obtain a retrograde signal in the stellar distribution in the outer halo , we simulate minor mergers of a satellite halo onto a main halo of galactic mass , with a mass ratio @xmath2 .",
    "we put the satellite on two orbits , one prograde and one retrograde .",
    "after the satellite completes its merging / disruption process , we identify stars at distance larger than 15 kpc from the disk plane and simply analyze their rotation velocities .",
    "our main finding is that a counter - rotating stellar halo naturally arises when minor mergers happen on orbits with a low inclination with respect to the disk plane .",
    "the plan of the letter is the following . in section [ sec :",
    "sim ] , we describe our simulations ; in section [ sec : res ] , we give our results on counter - rotating outer halo stars , and in section [ sec : concl ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "we use a primary dark matter ( dm ) halo containing a stellar , rotating exponential disk .",
    "the dm halo has a nfw @xcite radial density profile , and a mass , radius and concentration appropriate for a milky way like dm halo at redshift @xmath3 .",
    "dm particles have velocities given by the local equilibrium approximation @xcite . into our halo , we embed a truncated stellar disk , having an exponential surface density law : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the disk scale length , and @xmath6 is the surface central density .",
    "we obtain each disk particle s position using the rejection method by @xcite ; the disk is in gravitational equilibrium with the dm halo ( see @xcite for further details ) .",
    "we choose for the minor merger satellite a mass ratio of @xmath7 , similar to the estimated mass ratio of the lmc to the milky way halo .",
    "the satellite contains a stellar bulge , with a hernquist radial density profile .",
    "we realized our dm+bulge satellite configuration as in @xcite .",
    "all the physical parameters of our merger are listed in table  [ table : ic ] .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : npart ]    it remains to be determined if the counter - rotating signal is caused by the interaction with the stellar disk of the main halo , or by the dm of the halo itself .",
    "the upper row of figure [ fig : spin0 ] shows the results of the same analysis performed on our set a , but in the case in which no halo spin is present ( set b ) .",
    "here we only show the results for our last snapshot ; as in figure [ fig : spin1 ] , averaging over five snapshots makes no appreciable difference .",
    "also in our set b , low inclination retrograde orbits produce more counter - rotating star particle than co - rotating stars produced by prograde orbits .",
    "again , this is not the case for high inclination orbits . from figure",
    "[ fig : spin0 ] , it is clear that the excess of counter - rotating star is clearly smaller : and this is due to the fact that _ more _ co - rotating stars are produced by prograde orbit in our no spin case than in spin 1 case . from table [ tab : npart ] , the counter - rotating excess signal is 1.60 at peaks and 1.59 overall in the low inclination case , and 1.17 at peaks and 1.02 overall in the high inclination one .    therefore , both disk rotation and halo spin contribute to the slowing - down of prograde orbits and to the consequent smaller amount of high - energy star particles stripped from satellites that can reach the outer halo .",
    "the lower row of figure  [ fig : spin0 ] shows that our result does not depend on the mass resolution of our satellite halo . even using 10 times more particles in the secondary",
    ", only our low inclination couple of mergers shows an excess of counter - rotating stars in the outer halo .",
    "two effects are acting on the satellite halo in these kind of mergers : dynamical friction and tidal disruption . the first one is exerted both by the main halo dm particles and by the disk star particles .",
    "the second is most important near the center of the main halo , where the gravitational potential is stronger .",
    "but , dynamical friction depends upon the details of the satellite orbits .",
    "it is already known @xcite that prograde orbits tends to decay faster than retrograde ones .",
    "the dynamical friction _ force _ goes as @xmath8 @xcite , where @xmath9 is the velocity of the satellite relative to the field particles ; retrograde satellites have higher @xmath9 with respect to prograde one , since in the first case the rotation velocity of the satellite is opposite to that of the disk and the main dm halo particles .",
    "particles stripped from the satellites will remain on the orbit on which the satellite was when they were stripped .",
    "therefore , retrograde satellites `` deposit '' more star particles in the outer halo regions , producing the signal we observe in our simulations , since their orbits have a longer decay time . obviously , to obtain this effect , the _ orbital _",
    "velocity must lie on the disk plane , which is almost the case for our low inclination orbits .",
    "high inclination encounters do not show such a behavior .    in figure",
    "[ fig : cms ] , we plot the position of the center of mass of all the star particles belonging to the satellite as a function of time . in our low inclination mergers",
    "( left panel ) , the prograde orbit decades faster : already after 1.5 gyr , the difference with the behavior of the retrograde satellite is clear .",
    "in the high inclination cases the effect , though present , is much smaller , as expected .",
    "we also verified that the effect we show here does not depend upon the exact angular momentum distribution of particles in dm halo , by repeating our experiments using a bullock ( 2001 ) profile instead of a rigid rotation one for the dm rotation velocity .",
    "finally , the initial distance at which we put our satellite does not have a great impact on our results : we repeated the low - inclination mergers , putting the satellite at coordinates ( 29.5 , 0.27 , -5.2 ) kpc , thus much nearer to the center , and obtained the same qualitative behavior .",
    "we performed controlled numerical simulations of minor merger events .",
    "our aim was to determine if an excess of counter - rotating stars in the outer stellar halo can be produced by couples of mergers having orbits with identical inclination and opposite initial rotation .",
    "our primary halo has an exponential stellar disk and its dark matter has a nfw radial density profile ; our satellite s dm has an nfw density profile , and contains a stellar spheroid with a hernquist density profile .",
    "the mass ratio of our merger is @xmath10 .",
    "we simulate low inclination encounters , in which the angle of the satellite s orbit with the disk plane is 10 degrees , and high inclination ones ( 60 degrees ) .",
    "we use prograde and retrograde orbits and also vary the dm spin parameter of the main halo .",
    "dm spin is aligned with the disk rotation . here",
    "we define all stars having a distance @xmath11 kpc from the disk plane as belonging to the outer stellar halo .",
    "* low inclination mergers do produce an excess of counter - rotating satellite stellar particles in the outer halo , independently on the spin of the dm ; * our 60 degrees mergers with our 1:40 mass ratio are not able to give a significant counter - rotating signal , also owing to the disk tilt produced by the merger itself ; * the fraction of counter - rotating to co - rotating satellite stars in the outer stellar halo is higher if the dm has spin .    from our controlled experiments , we now have an indication of the possible origin of the counter - rotation of stars observed in the galactic outer halo in the context of a hierarchical @xmath12cdm model of galaxy formation , in which many major mergers happen during the history of the galaxy .",
    "even if , statistically , the number of prograde and retrograde minor merger is the same , still a counter - rotating signal can arise _ if such mergers predominantly happen along low inclination orbits_. since matter accretion , in a cdm dominated universe , mainly occurs along filaments , this will be the case _ if the galaxy disk is co - planar _ to the ( majority of ) filaments .",
    "the disk - filament alignment issue is still debated ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : from our results , we expect that if the galactic disk were perpendicular to the main accretion streams , no counter - rotating signal should be observed in the outer halo star distribution .",
    "our orbits are _ not _ cosmologically motivated , since the aim of our experiment is to determine _ if _ and _ in what cases _ an excess of counter - rotating stars in the outer halo can be produced .",
    "of course , in a realistic case mergers will occur with orbits having a number of different inclinations , giving rise to a velocity distribution which will not show such a clear , double peaked signal as that detected in the present work .",
    "a detailed study of the orbital parameters of minor mergers in a statistically significant set of cosmological galaxy - sized halo cosmological accretion histories is needed before a quantitative comparison between theory expectations and observation can be performed .",
