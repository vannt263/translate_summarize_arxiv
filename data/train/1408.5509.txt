    ". however , for periodic boundary conditions most finite - size scaling properties near the critical ( inverse ) temperature @xmath10 are well known . for example , the susceptibility behaves as @xmath11 for @xmath12 , in sharp contrast to @xmath13 for @xmath14 , with a logarithmic correction for @xmath3 .",
    "there is plenty of literature on @xmath9 for periodic boundary conditions , to name but a few , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "much less has been written on the subject of free boundary conditions above the upper critical dimension , but see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "as can be seen from the references in those two papers there has been some debate on whether the standard scaling picture , saying that e.g. the susceptibility scales as @xmath0 for free boundary , holds or whether an alternative theory proposing that it scales as @xmath1 is correct . in @xcite the current authors simulated the 5-dimensional model on larger systems than previous authors and found that the data supported the standard scaling picture . in a reply @xcite it was again suggested that the alternative picture is correct and that the results of @xcite were due to too small systems , dominated by finite size effects stemming from their large boundaries .",
    "the purpose of this paper is two - fold .",
    "we have extended the 5-dimensional simulations with free boundary from @xcite to much larger systems , up to @xmath2 , where the boundary vertices make up less than @xmath15 of the system .",
    "first , using the new data , we give improved estimates of the critical energy , specific heat and several other quantities at the critical point .",
    "second , we compare how well the standard scaling and the alternative theory fit our new large system data , and discuss why , based on mathematical results on the random cluster model , there are good reasons for expecting the standard picture to be the correct one , as the data also suggests .",
    "for a given graph @xmath16 the hamiltonian with interactions of unit strength along the edges is @xmath17 where the sum is taken over the edges @xmath18 . as usual @xmath19 is the dimensionless inverse temperature and we denote the temperature equilibrium mean by @xmath20 .",
    "the susceptibility is defined as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the magnetisation per spin , and the specific heat as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the energy per spin , and for short we write @xmath25 .",
    "the underlying graph in question is an @xmath26 grid graph with free boundary conditions , or equivalently , the cartesian product of five paths on @xmath27 vertices .",
    "we have collected data for grid graphs of linear order @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 . for @xmath2 we thus present data for systems on more than 100 billion vertices .",

    "standard errors were estimated by exploiting the separate systems .",
    "for the larger systems ( @xmath54 ) , due to the comparably few measurements , we also used bootstrapping on the entire data set for estimating standard errors .",
    "to double - check for equilibration problems we compared with subsets of the data after rejecting early measurements .",
    "the different couplings for @xmath45 showed no discernible difference in their scaling behaviour for @xmath55 .",
    "based on the behaviour for @xmath56 we have designated @xmath57 , which is a little higher than what we used in ref .",
    "@xcite and marginally lower than that used in e.g. ref .",
    "the lion s share of sampling were then made at @xmath58 and for @xmath59 we have measured only at @xmath10 .    for all sizes we measured magnetisation and energy , storing their moment sums .",
    "for @xmath45 we also measured many properties regarding the clusters that were generated and used for consistency checks , and one of them will be shown in the discussion section .",
    "a potentially important issue for systems with free boundary condition is the size of the boundary , and in particular the fraction of vertices on the boundary . of the @xmath60 vertices in the graph @xmath61",
    "are inner vertices and thus @xmath62 vertices sit on the boundary .",
    "the fraction of boundary vertices is then @xmath63 . for @xmath64",
    "this means that the boundary constitutes no less than @xmath65 of all vertices .",

    "so our largest system have a clear minority of their vertices on the boundary .",
    "another important measure is the number of vertices with a given minimum distance to the boundary . if we consider the cube of side @xmath73 around the centre vertex of the cube , i.e. the set of vertices with distance at least @xmath74 to the boundary we find that it contains a @xmath75 fraction of the @xmath76 vertices .",
    "that means that at least 50% of the vertices are at a distance of at most @xmath77 from the boundary , for _ every _ @xmath27 .",
    "similarly , the central cube with side @xmath78 contains just @xmath79 of the vertices of the cube .",
    "this means that even in the limit the effect of vertices close to the boundary will always be large , and that the vertices close to the central vertex will also remain atypical for any property which depend both on the distance to the boundary and the majority of the vertices in the cube .",
    "in particular we should expect such properties to be bounded from above the corresponding values in the infinite system thermodynamic limit , if they tend to decrease with the distance to the boundary .",
    "it is known @xcite that in the limit , for @xmath80 , the specific heat , i.e. the energy variance , is bounded for all temperatures , but the value is not known , and likewise for the critical energy . in fig .",
