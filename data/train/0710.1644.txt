    "it is known that dynamic vortex shedding can lead to losses in lift , sharp increases in drag , and destructive pitching moments and buffeting , which all limit an aircraft flight envelope .",
    "therefore , in order to improve aerodynamic characteristics , flow separation control would be highly desirable . the classical approach ",
    "an open - loop control achieved either by mechanical or fluidic actuation  has demonstrated robustness , but its efficiency is still far from optimal .",
    "this standard control scheme is based on actuator operating schedules , which are usually constructed using extensive and costly experimental studies .",
    "alternatively , from a theoretical point of view , should one be able to construct an accurate solution of the navier - stokes description ( nses ) for a given airfoil shape and flow conditions , it would suggest control strategies .",
    "however , in view of the impossibility of solving the nses in real time and in view of noisy and unpredictable real conditions , this approach is difficult to implement . at the same time , in reality one can use sensors on the boundary of lifting surfaces , which in turn read off a certain amount of extra information from the physical system and therefore should allow one to weaken the requirements on the accuracy of theoretical prediction of the flow behavior .",
    "thus , one is naturally led to consider _ coarse _ models .",
    "however , it should be kept in mind that the dynamical behavior of the original and coarsened ( reduced ) system will never be identical , and thus one has to decide , based on the application objectives , which aspects of the dynamics should be modelled accurately . in this work",
    "we identify the crucial elements of the dynamics of separation bubble , namely _ bifurcation _ and _ hysteresis _ , which need to be reflected in the model and thus result in the applicability of the model to a wide range of physical parameters .",
    "this procedure is targeted to produce a model , upon which an observer in a closed - loop control scheme can be based .",
    "being more efficient and reliable @xcite , feedback control also naturally allows one to address the optimization issue .",
    "while the above is a transparent justification to appeal to coarse modeling , the main challenge is that the resulting model should be both _ low - dimensional _ , for real time computational efficiency , and _",
    "physically motivated _ , in order to reflect the actual behavior for a wide range of flight and control parameters .",
    "since separation phenomena are clearly nonlinear , the model should also be _",
    "these are certainly _ key requirements _ on a model .",
    "while these key _ requirements _ are readily appreciated , the methods available to formulate such models are very limited and the connection of known models to physics is rather far from what is desired .",
    "a commonly used approach is to first generate experimental data and , then , to extract the model by a projection onto proper orthogonal decomposition ( pod ) modes using , for example , balanced truncation or similar methods , is not reliable in view of the open flow nature of the problem and the wide range of governing parameters .",
    "because of this , we shall make use of _ phenomenological _ modeling , which has been successful in many other problems , such as the use of duffing s equation for the buckling of elastic beams @xcite , simple maps to describe a dripping faucet @xcite , which even captures the observed chaotic behavior to a great extent , and bubble dynamics in time periodic straining flows @xcite , to name a few .",
    "the phenomenological approach was already used in the construction of the first few models for separation phenomena , _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite and the onera model @xcite , after the recent understanding of the importance of low - dimensional models for controlling separation .",
    "the state - of - the - art low dimensional model used in a closed - loop control of the dynamic stall with pulsed vortex generator jets is due to magill _",
    "its key feature is a choice of the governing physical parameters , such as lift @xmath0 and separation state @xmath1 with @xmath2 corresponding to fully attached flow and @xmath3 to fully separated flow .",
    "steady states , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , represent the baseline case and the measured steady lift , respectively , as functions of the angle of attack @xmath6 .",

    "z_{t } & = k_{3 } b_{tt } + k_{4 } \\left[z_{s}(\\alpha)-z\\right ] + \\gamma_{\\alpha } \\alpha_{t}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it should be stressed that this and many earlier attempts to develop dynamical models are based on the anzatz that this nonlinear phenomenon behaves linearly for small variations of the parameters involved @xcite , which clearly has many limitations , in particular can not account for bifurcations and hysteresis .",
    "thus , only with an alternative approach  the subject of this work  can one construct a model that meets the above _ requirements_. as it will be clear from the text later , while we appeal to phenomenological analysis of empirical facts , we provide the dynamical systems grounds for it .",
    "a symbiosis of these two methodologies yield a complete picture of the phenomena .      a central notion and object ,",
    "whose dynamics we study , is _ a separation bubble _ , whose main features are as follows .",
    "first of all , separation of the boundary layer develops due to an adverse pressure gradient @xcite which occurs when the angle of attack of an airfoil is sufficiently large , cf .",
    "figure [ separated_flow ] , and may be followed by re - attachment as in figure [ reattached_flow ] , thus forming a typical flow around an airfoil .",
    "the region encompassed by the boundary layer is termed a _ a separation bubble _ after the work of jones @xcite and , as shown in figure [ notion_bubble ] , it can be closed or open .",
    "classification of separation bubbles concerns their laminar or turbulent nature , but topologically they do not differ and thus we will not be distinguishing between various cases , but rather treat a _",
    "generic _ case .",
    "it should be noted that , in certain physical situations , a bubble needs to be understood in a time - averaged sense @xcite .",
    "given the notion of a separation bubble , our dynamical systems model will aim to capture its characteristics , which are important for controlling separation phenomena .",
    "a central idea of this work is to approach the modeling of separation bubble phenomena by identifying the key crucial elements of the bubble dynamics , namely bifurcations and hysteresis , in the appropriate portion of parameter space , as sketched in figure [ parametric_space ] . in this figure",
    "we show the minimal dimension of the parameter space , defined by the bubble size @xmath12 , the angle of attack @xmath6 , and the actuation amplitude @xmath13 ; that is , we will be looking for the minimal model determined by the dependence of the bubble size on the angle of attack and actuation amplitude .    , the angle of attack @xmath6 , and the actuation amplitude @xmath13 .",
    "]    this minimal approach is motivated by the fact that while generally there are other parameters involved , such as the reynolds number @xmath14 , the critical angle of attack @xmath15 , and the airfoil thickness @xmath16 , the resulting model will still have wide applicability .",
    "this can be understood based on the aerodynamic properties of airfoils . to explain this",
    ", we draw critical curves , i.e. , when separation takes place depending upon @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 in figure [ thick_airfoils ] .",
    "as illustrated by figure [ re_vs_h ] , in the case of real airfoils , separation occurs at finite reynolds numbers even at zero critical angle of attack ; the higher @xmath15 the lower the critical reynolds number @xmath17 ; also , the thicker the airfoil , the lower @xmath17 . figure [ alpha_vs_h ] demonstrates the fact that the thinner an airfoil , the larger the critical angle of attack is required to achieve separation at a given reynolds number @xmath18 .",
    "finally , in the @xmath15-@xmath14 plane in figure [ alpha_vs_re ] one can observe that for fixed airfoil thickness @xmath19 separation can occur at zero @xmath15 , which requires high enough reynolds numbers .",
    "since in reality the reynolds numbers are huge ( e.g. for real aircraft @xmath14 varies between @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) , one concludes that limiting ourselves to `` thick airfoils '' , which can , in fact , be regarded as real airfoils since they have to carry structural load and fuel , is not a serious restriction in this first step towards low - dimensional modeling of separation phenomena .    to achieve the above objectives of our modeling identified above , we will appeal to the tools of the bifurcation and catastrophe theory @xcite , as will be made precise in  [ sec : bifurcation_bubble ] .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in  [ sec : bifurcation_bubble ] , we discuss the first nonlinear aspect of separation bubbles , namely bifurcation phenomenon and the way to model it . in  [ sec : hysteresis_bubble ] , we explore the basic physics of hysteresis phenomena , and suggest its mathematical model and how to construct a single model capable of capturing both bifurcation and hysteresis .",
    "as was noted in the introduction , bubbles can be either in a closed or open state .",
    "this allows us to introduce a key element of the low - dimensional modeling , namely it must capture this _",
    "basic bifurcation _ from an _ open _ to a _ closed _ state , as shown schematically in figure [ basic_bifurcation ] , which is also known as _ bursting _ @xcite .",
    "notably , the fact that this is the primary bifurcation was realized just recently @xcite . the vast literature on separation bubbles behavior is still at a descriptive level and suggests that one separated flow is not like any other . here",
    "we take a different point of view , i.e. we treat the coarse behavior of separation bubbles as ( generic ) phenomena that can be modelled by a single low dimensional dynamical system .      to quantify the behavior of a separation bubble ,",
    "consider the coordinate @xmath12 , measuring the distance along the airfoil from the bubble onset to the bubble reattachment , as shown in figure [ basic_bifurcation ] .",
    "the bubble dynamics in the first approximation can be described by two parameters : the location of separation , @xmath22 , and of reattachment , @xmath23 , which can move under the change of flight and control parameters . in some cases , e.g. the glauert glas ii airfoils , the separation point @xmath22 remains fixed for all practical purposes .",
    "therefore , we will start by considering only the behavior of the reattachment point , which experiences a primary bifurcation in the above sense ; extending the model to include variation of @xmath22 will require the addition of a reliable separation criterion .",
    "as an alternative to @xmath23 , one could also utilize the bubble area . from now on we will use @xmath12 as a variable representing the bubble state .      the mechanism by which the excitation affects the flow lies in the generation of instabilities , and thus of large coherent structures transferring high momentum fluid towards the surface , and therefore leading to reattachment , as indicated in figure [ mechanism_actuation ] .",
    "since actuation exploits the instabilities of the shear layer @xcite , the response to actuation depends on both @xmath13 and @xmath24 and therefore is nonlinear .",
    "the latter again indicates , now from the point of view of actuation control mechanisms , that the low - dimensional model must be nonlinear .",
    "as follows from experiments , the critical phenomena are as sketched in figure [ criticality ] , where the shaded region corresponds to a reattached flow ( that is , a closed bubble ) and the arrow indicates a change in location of the transition curve with an increase in @xmath6 .",
    "the size of the bubble , @xmath12 , has a specific dependence on the amplitude @xmath13 and frequency @xmath24 of actuation , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath25 , when moving away from the origin @xmath26 in figure [ criticality ] . in this work",
    "we focus on the case of time - invariant actuation , @xmath27 , although the time - varying case will be commented on later in this section .",
    "finally , it is notable that the criticality and hysteresis phenomena depend on the connectedness of the flow domain : the bubble experiences bifurcation only in the case of flow around an airfoil , as in figure [ airfoil_model ] , while in the case of a hump model in figure [ hump_model ] , which is frequently used in experiments , there is no bifurcation .",
    "thus , there are two basic configurations in which the behavior of the separation bubble differs : the _ hump model _ and the _ airfoil model_. namely , in the hump case @xmath28 is smooth , while in the case of an airfoil @xmath28 is discontinuous .",
    "also , as will be important in  3 , the hysteresis phenomena are present only in the airfoil case .    here , in view of its practical importance , we naturally focus on the airfoil case .      in developing a model , we are guided by the principle of a minimal complexity together with the physical requirements one has to meet . at the methodological level , there are two basic ways to account for the form of @xmath28 , which has both the saturation and criticality shown in figure [ experimental_configurations ] : ( a ) to design @xmath29 as an _ algebraic _ relation , or ( b ) to introduce a _ dynamic _ description @xmath30 .",
    "the latter approach is better suited for dynamics and control purposes , because in the case of active feedback control one would need to deal with a few characteristic times and transient effects , and thus the model should be time - dependent .",
    "the simplest possible way of introducing time - dependent dynamics is a second - order oscillator model , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a damping parameter .",
    "the justification for the latter may serve the fact that both separation and reattachment points may oscillate @xcite .",
    "in what follows , we first formulate mathematical requirements on a model in  [ subsubsection : math_req ] , then by appealing to the ideas of a potential function in  [ subsubsection : pot_fun ] and a dynamic bifurcation in  [ subsubsection : dyn_bif ] , we construct the model in  [ subsubsection : model ] .      naturally , the bubble size @xmath12 also depends on a _ flight parameter _ , in our case the angle of attack @xmath6 , which needs to be incorporated in the model ; thus , @xmath33 .",
    "since we want to minimize the functional complexity , but to retain the nonlinear features of the phenomena , the simplest form is a quadratic nonlinearity , @xmath34 , which possesses a takens - bogdanov bifurcation , as shown in figure [ takens_bogdanov_bifurcation ] , when @xmath35 changes sign .",
    "indeed , equilibria points are given by @xmath36 , so that @xmath37 can be represented as @xmath38 .",
    "the eigenvalues of the linearization around @xmath39 are given by @xmath40 , while the eigenvalues of the linearization around @xmath41 are @xmath42 .",
    "thus when @xmath43 changes sign , one observes the transition from the picture in figure [ open ] to the one in figure [ closed ] .",
    "the requirements on the parameters in this model are dictated by the physics :    ( a ) : :    the stability of equilibria points should obey    @xmath44 where stability implies that    one equilibrium is stable ( @xmath45 is imaginary ) , and    the second one is unstable ( @xmath45 is real ) .",
    "the above    inequalities indicate that the physical behavior of the model is also    governed by the critical angle of attack @xmath15 ,    when the flow separates at @xmath46 , and the critical control    amplitude @xmath47 , when flow reattaches at    @xmath6 fixed .",
    "( b ) : :    the critical actuation amplitude @xmath48 should grow with    @xmath49 , since the higher the angle of    attack , the more control input is required to make the flow    reattached .",
    "( c ) : :    the bubble size @xmath12 , which is a stable equilibrium , should    shrink , @xmath50 as @xmath13 increases . at    the same time , the domain of attraction of this equilibrium should    shrink too , so that the bubble becomes susceptible to the    finite - amplitude instabilities , as it is known from experiments , cf .",
    "the upper part of figure [ criticality ] .      in order to get better insight in the model construction ,",
    "let us assign a potential function @xmath51 such that @xmath52 : @xmath53 which is physically determined by the elastic properties of a bubble and its interaction with the outer flow .",
    "then we can observe that a finite bubble corresponds to @xmath51 as in figure [ potential_stable_bifurcation ] , and an infinite bubble corresponds to figure [ potential_unstable_bifurcation ] .    without loss of generality",
    ", we can assume that @xmath54 .",
    "considering @xmath13 , as a control parameter , the requirements on the coefficients in @xmath51 are such that the equilibria , @xmath55 , obey @xmath56 the stability conditions can also be reformulated in terms of eigenvalues , as indicated in figure [ bifurcation ] . in this particular case ,",
    "the equilibria points @xmath57 are easily computable : @xmath58 and @xmath59 . the stability criterion ( second variation ) for these",
    "equilibria is given by the sign of the second derivative , @xmath60 , which at the equilibria points assumes the values @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "besides the stability conditions , one needs to impose @xmath63 , since the bubble shrinks when the control amplitude increases . thus",
    ", the bifurcation from the state in figure [ potential_stable_bifurcation ] to the one in figure [ potential_unstable_bifurcation ] is obviously associated with the condition when @xmath64 .",
    "as one can further infer , in the space of curves in @xmath65 there is an infinite number of solutions @xmath66 , @xmath67 . in practice ,",
    "a _ systematic procedure _ would be as follows : depending on the particularities of the experimental data , one expands @xmath62 and @xmath68 in terms of some basis functions of @xmath13 , @xmath48 , etc . , and then determines coefficients in that expansion through the calibration procedure .",
    "-plane : on the dynamic bifurcation ; solid black line represents stable equilibria , solid red line is a dynamic bifurcation when bubble grows indefinitely with time .",
    "phase portraits in rectangles correspond to the ones in figure [ takens_bogdanov_bifurcation ] . ]",
    "the transition from one potential to another is controlled by a bifurcation parameter , such as angle of attack @xmath6 or actuation amplitude @xmath13 .",
    "in fact , the latter two parameters are interchangeable to a certain extent as argued in @xcite , since a change in @xmath6 or in @xmath13 leads to a change in circulation around an airfoil , and thus to a change in the flow structure .",
    "apparently , this transition of @xmath12 from finite to infinite is _ dynamic _ in a sense that the bubble becomes infinite in figure [ potential_unstable_bifurcation ] as time @xmath69 .",
    "this _ dynamic bifurcation _ can be clarified using phase portraits in figure [ bifurcation ] , and should be opposed to the standard static bifurcation , which is of algebraic nature as resulting from the condition of vanishing vector fields . as one can learn from figure [ bifurcation ] , at the critical value of the actuation amplitude @xmath48 both equilibria coincide and are unstable ( marginally stable ) , so that the bubble grows with time and becomes unbounded for @xmath69 . for @xmath70",
    "there are two equilibria points , one is unstable and one is stable .",
    "the latter corresponds to the situation when bubble is of finite size , and this state has a finite domain of attraction .",
    "note that the potential energy shape , as in figure [ potential_bifurcation ] , is crucial in allowing the `` dynamic '' bifurcation : a @xmath71-shaped potential function apparently would not allow this type of bifurcation , as well as the domain of attraction would be modelled inconsistently with physics .",
    "similar type of argument will be applied to the hysteresis phenomena in  [ sec : hysteresis_bubble ] . in conclusion ,",
    "having identified , based on the physical argumentation , that the potential should be of the shape as in figure [ potential_bifurcation ] in order to allow a dynamic bifurcation , the problem reduces to determination of the coefficients in .",
    "this general procedure is the subject of the catastrophe theory @xcite and , at the technical level , is in the realm of calculus @xcite .      for simplicity , restricting ourselves to the case of thick airfoils when separation occurs at @xmath72 without actuation , with one of infinitely many admissible choices of @xmath62 and @xmath68 we get : @xmath73 here @xmath74 represents a _ nonlinear response _ of the separation region to actuator excitations @xmath13 .",
    "the product @xmath75 implies that the effect of actuation depends upon the bubble size @xmath12 .",
    "as required , @xmath76 and the bubble shrinks as @xmath77 for @xmath78 . while this is the simplest possibility , from the above description it is clear that there is enough flexibility to calibrate the model through the fitting functions , @xmath79 , and parameters , @xmath80 within the given above bounds .    by construction , the model reflects the basic generic dynamic behavior of separation bubbles . in",
    "the _ conservative _ time - invariant case the parameter space is just @xmath81 .",
    "when control is absent , @xmath82 , the bubble is open , which corresponds to an unstable phase portrait in figure [ open ] , that is any initial conditions lead to an unbounded bubble size @xmath12 .",
    "when sufficient control is applied ( consider first @xmath6 fixed ) , the bubble closes , which is reflected in the change of the phase portrait as shown in figure [ closed ] . in this case",
    "there are two equilibrium points , one is a saddle , which is unstable and thus not physically observable , and another one is a stable center .",
    "therefore , there exists a non - zero basin of attraction which leads to a finite bubble size , @xmath83 .",
    "figure [ closed ] also suggests that the system is susceptible to finite - amplitude instability for @xmath70 , the fact which is conceivable but has never been studied in experiments systematically .",
    "nevertheless , it is known empirically that the bubble opens if the actuation amplitude becomes large enough , as in figure [ criticality ] ; see also @xcite .",
    "also , the fact that the boundary layer is susceptible to finite - amplitude instabilities @xcite suggests that the separation bubble formed out of it may also be finite - amplitude unstable .",
    "the inclusion of dissipation in the model does not change the nature of the phase portrait ; however , it does change the basin of attraction .",
    "finally , the inclusion of time - varying effects in the control , @xmath84 with @xmath85 , also demonstrates that the bubble transforms from an open to a closed state .",
    "thus , as required , the model captures the primary bifurcation and dynamic behavior of the separation bubble , except for the hysteresis . in the rest of this paper",
    "we will explain how the model can be _ enhanced _ to account for the hysteresis shown in figure [ conjecture ] .",
    "while the model is given for one of infinitely many choices of parameters , it is clear that a variety of other admissible choices can produce the same type of bifurcation and dynamics .",
    "this freedom to choose parameters is important , however , in order to fit the model to a particular application via calibration .",
    "it is notable that a model of a similar form was deduced _",
    "ad hoc _ for a real bubble deforming in a straining flow studied by kang & leal @xcite , shown in figure [ fourroll ] , which experiences a bifurcation from a deformed but closed state to an open tip - streaming state , when bubble forms pointed open ends emitting tiny bubbles .",
    "namely , the model is @xmath86 , where @xmath13 is the control parameter ( weber number ) .",
    "the dynamics of this problem is illustrated in figure [ codim2_bifurcation ] for the conservative case , @xmath87 , and reflects the fact that for the same @xmath13 there are two equilibria , one of which is a stable center and another one is a saddle ; the latter is not observed physically in view of its unstable character .",
    "this problem also illustrates the analogy of the dynamics of real and separation bubbles .",
    "the basic effects of time - varying control were discussed in  [ subsec : bubble_bifurcation_nature ] and reflected in figure [ criticality ] . however , the effect of changing amplitude and frequency is not trivial in view of the presence of a hysteresis @xcite in all variables @xmath88 , as illustrated in figure [ conjecture ] for the dependence of the bubble size on the actuation amplitude , @xmath28 .",
    "experiments demonstrate that hysteresis is present no matter how slowly the actuation amplitude @xmath13 is changed , which suggests that the model should depend only on the sign of the rate @xmath89 .    .",
    "]    therefore , the model should reflect the fact that there are two stable steady state solutions for the range of the control parameter @xmath90 , as in figure [ conjecture ] , which is an experimental fact .",
    "mathematically , this means that the selection between these two solutions is due to the placement of initial conditions in the corresponding domain of attraction .",
    "also , for @xmath91 , there should be only on stable solution , while for @xmath92 the bubble should `` bifurcate '' to infinity in a dynamical manner as described in ",
    "[ subsec : bubble_bifurcation_model ] .",
    "the challenge of modeling the hysteresis comes from the fact that the behavior of the bubble is known only from experimental observations , while there are no analytical results .",
    "clearly , the domain of attraction of stable solutions is not well - characterized from the existing empirical data .",
    "therefore , in order to model hysteresis , one first needs to understand its physical origin , which is addressed below , in  [ subsec : hysteresis_physics ] , where we suggest the physical mechanisms of the hysteresis .",
    "this together with the dynamical systems and catastrophe theory allow us to modify the model to account for hysteresis , which is the subject of  [ subsec : hysteresis_model ] .",
    "physically , the separation bubble is caused by a strong adverse pressure gradient , which makes the boundary layer separate from the curved airfoil surface .",
    "actuation with @xmath93 effectively reduces the adverse pressure gradient , i.e. , the larger the angle of attack @xmath6 , the stronger the adverse pressure gradient : this `` interchangeability '' of the effects of the actuation amplitude and the angle of attack is well - known @xcite and is reflected in the dependence @xmath47 . ] and makes the bubble closed , as in figure [ closed_bubble ] .",
    "this can be seen from bernoulli s equation , since the velocity drop is related to the pressure rise , @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is a dynamic pressure , and @xmath96 is the fluid pressure at rest . from bernoulli s equation and figure [ basic_bifurcation ]",
    "we can conclude that pressure rise @xmath97 and bubble length @xmath98 correlate @xmath99 and @xmath100 , respectively .",
    "for the current purposes we neglect by the second order effects of vorticity and thus assume constant pressure inside the bubble , @xmath101 .",
    "let us compare the above behavior of a separation bubble with that of a real static bubble ( see figure [ contrasting ] ) , which is governed by @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the pressure inside the bubble , @xmath96 is the pressure outside the bubble , @xmath104 is the interfacial tension , and @xmath105 is the radius of the bubble . apparently , if the pressure @xmath96 outside the bubble decreases while the pressure inside is maintained constant , the bubble shrinks .",
    "this behavior of a real bubble , when its pressure inside is maintained constant , contrasts with that of a separation bubble , which grows if the pressure outside the bubble , @xmath95 , reduces .",
    "the underlying physics of these two problems differs : in the first case , the phenomena are dominated by static forces , while separation phenomena are dynamic .",
    "this suggests that the separation bubble boundary possesses elastic properties , which for the current purposes can be modelled with negative interfacial tension .",
    "note that real ( positive ) tension tends to minimize the interfacial area , while the effective tension of the shear layer tends to maximize the bubble boundary and only the external energy input ( excitation ) counterparts this effect and makes the bubble closed : this justifies a negative sign of the tension .",
    "alternatively , one can use a nontrivial state equation for the pressure inside the bubble , which can be measured experimentally .",
    "the elasticity of the separation bubble is evidenced by introducing disturbances outside the bubble and observing the changes in the bubble characteristics , i.e. shape and pressure inside .    with the above physical background",
    ", we can provide a simple mechanistic model explaining the origin of the hysteresis . for simplicity",
    ", consider the two - dimensional situation depicted in figure [ mechanical_analog ] : a hemispherical bubble having variable size with the left end fixed and with its right end free to move thus modeling a separation bubble with moving reattachment point .",
    "the bubble size changes depending upon the free - stream velocity @xmath106 , which is chosen to be the control parameter . when @xmath106 increases and the right end of the bubble reaches the trailing edge at @xmath107 at critical @xmath108 , the pressure inside the bubble increases by a finite amount , @xmath109 , which is due to suction of a high pressure fluid from the lower side of the airfoil .",
    "hence the bubble size increases abruptly by some amount .",
    "conversely , when @xmath106 decreases and bubble reaches the trailing edge at @xmath107 at a different critical @xmath110 , the pressure inside the bubble relaxes to its original value , @xmath111 .",
    "the jump in pressure at the critical point  when reattachment is at the trailing edge  has the following physical explanation .",
    "it is known that the lift drops when the bubble opens , which effectively means that the pressure balance between the lower and upper surfaces of an airfoil has changed : some amount of pressure at the lower surface has leaked into the upper surface , namely into the bubble . the latter is allowed by unsteadiness of the process , i.e. , the unsteady kutta - joukowsky condition .    therefore , the mechanical analog of a separation bubble is @xmath112 , so that the bubble grows when the ambient pressure dictated by bernoulli s equation , @xmath113 , decreases :    [ model_mechanistic_hysteresis ] @xmath114    which produces a hysteretic behavior .",
    "obviously , @xmath115 is consistent with the physical observations .        in the light of the above",
    ", one can account for the hysteresis in figure [ conjecture ] in model as follows .",
    "when @xmath116 and @xmath13 passes through @xmath48 the transformation @xmath117 with @xmath118 is applied , since physically the effectiveness of control drops by @xmath119 . when @xmath120 and @xmath121 then @xmath122 , since too conservative amount of control has been applied before reaching @xmath121 .",
    "these altogether lead to the desired hysteretic behavior .",
    "same can be done to account for the hysteretic dependence on the angle of attack @xmath6 .",
    "the above mechanistic model of the hysteresis captures the physics and proves that the separation bubble has a nontrivial potential function associated with it .",
    "it should be noted that such type of discontinuous modeling of hysteresis based on the rate @xmath123 is still widely used in applications and known as _ play _ and _ stop _ ( classical prandtl model ) models , cf .",
    "visintin @xcite .",
    "however , for the purpose of deriving a universal model which combines both the bifurcation and the hysteresis in a dynamic manner , i.e. suitable for control purposes , it makes sense to follow another way of modeling hysteresis phenomena , based on the choice of an appropriate potential function @xmath51 , similar to what was done in  [ subsec : bubble_bifurcation_model ] .",
    "we will enforce this point of view in  [ subsec : analogies_hysteresis ] , where we will illustrate the analogy to other physical phenomena .",
    "the grounding thesis is that the true curve of states in figure [ conjecture ] is not the solid discontinuous one , but rather the `` true '' picture for separation bubbles corresponds to the smooth curve ( including the dashed line ) in figure [ conjecture ] , the fact which has not been realized in the literature before .",
    "this smooth curve corresponds to the equilibria states of an appropriate potential function @xmath51 ; the dashed curve is not physically observable in view of instability of the corresponding equilibria states . from  [ subsec : bubble_bifurcation_model ] we know that the potential function should be of special shape , i.e. when @xmath124 , then @xmath125 , that is the highest order terms in @xmath6 should be odd .",
    "then , as a natural generalization of the picture in figure [ bifurcation ] , we arrive at figure [ hysteresis ] .",
    "-plane and corresponding potential functions ; solid black lines represent stable equilibria , while dashed lines are unstable equilibria ; solid red line represents a dynamic bifurcation ( bubble size grows with time unboundedly ) .",
    "plots @xmath51 in rectangles show the shape of the potential for @xmath126 , @xmath127 $ ] , @xmath91 , respectively . ]    at the technical level , the lowest order potential suitable for achieving the picture in figure [ hysteresis ] is of the fifth order , so that model becomes @xmath128 with @xmath51 of the fifth order .",
    "the existence of such potential is apparent , and its coefficients in the polynomial representation can be found with the help of linear programming given a set of inequalities and equalities based on the calibration requirements .",
    "the fact that the hysteresis originates from the particularity of the potential function is well - known from other physical systems , e.g. a ferromagnetic drop deforming in a magnetic field @xcite and cavitating hydrofoils @xcite .",
    "consider the _ deformation of ferrofluid drop _ of permeability @xmath129 , placed in a fluid of permeability @xmath130 , in a magnetic field @xcite .",

    "the magnetic energy is of the form @xmath135 where @xmath136\\right\\}/2 \\epsilon^{3}$ ] is the demagnetization factor , @xmath71 is the volume of the drop , and @xmath137 is the applied magnetic field .",
    "minimization of the total energy , @xmath138 , with respect to the aspect ratio @xmath139 produces @xmath140 the behavior of which is depicted in figure [ ferro ] .",
    "the bubble shape is a simple counterplay between magnetic and interfacial energy of the drop : the former tends to elongate the drop , while the latter tends to make the drop spherical .        for certain values of @xmath141",
    "there are three solutions , but not all of them are stable .",
    "when the solution reaches point a it jumps to the point b , and similarly for the points c and d. ac portion corresponds to a maximum of @xmath142 and thus is unstable , while the rest of the curve is minima of @xmath142 and thus is stable .    finally , a _ cavitation bubble _ on a _ hydrofoil _ , where hysteresis can be explained with the help of inviscid free - streamline theory @xcite , is another example , where it has been done analytically . in this physical problem",
    "the boundary of the bubble is well - defined physically and thus the problem is reliably treated with a free - streamline theory , that is its predictions @xcite agree well with experiments @xcite .",
    "for the theoretical treatments of cavitation flows with free - streamline theory we refer to tulin @xcite , yeung & parkinson @xcite , birkhoff & zarantonello @xcite , and on the physics of cavitation flows to wu @xcite , brennen @xcite .        on the physical side of cavitation phenomena , it is known from the general equations of fluid dynamics that the pressure depends on the velocity distribution ( in the steady case ) and on the acceleration ( in the unsteady case ) . more importantly , the pressure might become negative at points where the velocity is large . in the majority of cases",
    ", fluids can not sustain a negative pressure and the continuity of the flow breaks down . as a result , a region filled with fluid vapor is formed  this is a cavitation phenomena ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . in continuous",
    "incompressible flows the maximum velocity occurs at the boundary and hence cavitation first appears on the body surface : @xmath143 which is a cavitation number .",
    "deviations from this law are due to vortex shedding and other unsteady effects .",
    "the behavior of the cavitation bubble is given by for partially cavitating , @xmath144 @xcite , and supercavitating , @xmath145 @xcite , foils respectively ,    [ cavity_length ] @xmath146    where @xmath6 is the angle of attack .",
    "the expressions are basically the solution of the equilibrium condition , @xmath147 , and schematically shown in figure [ cavitation_hysteresis ] for fixed cavitation number ( see also sychev @xcite ) .",
    "this work has focused on the fundamental aspects  the most important physics and dynamic behavior  of a generic separation bubble using thick airfoils as a paradigm . given an incomplete experimental knowledge of the complex phenomena of separation bubble",
    ", we applied the deduction based on bifurcation and catastrophe theory and thus ( 1 ) filled in incomplete pieces in the dynamical picture of the phenomena , ( 2 ) advocated that this dynamical picture is finite - dimensional at the coarse level , ( 3 ) developed a constructive way of building a model , and ( 4 ) produced a model .",
    "the model can be enhanced in particular by ( a ) incorporating a non - trivial state equation of a bubble , ( b ) accounting for separation at non - zero angle of attack @xmath148 , and ( c ) calibrating the model for a given airfoil .",
    "these are the future directions of this study and will require considerable theoretical and experimental efforts .",
    "we also expect that this approach to low dimensional modeling will be helpful in real time flow control ."
