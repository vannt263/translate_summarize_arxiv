    "based on monochromatic euv images obtained during the _ skylab _ mission foukal et al .",
    "( 1974 ) introduced the notation `` sunspot plumes '' , defined as areas above sunspot umbrae that are `` the brightest features in an active region by an order of magnitude '' .",
    "this led to the idea that sunspot plumes are regions within large magnetic loops , extending to altitudes of several thousand kilometers above the photosphere , in which the temperature is one to two orders of magnitude lower than in the corona of the surrounding active region ( noyes et al .",
    "in contrast , brueckner and bartoe ( 1974 ) observed enhanced line emission both over plages and sunspots and cheng , doschek , & feldman ( 1976 ) found that emission lines formed at temperatures below 2.4 @xmath0 10@xmath1k showed the same line emission over the sunspot as over the quiet network .",
    "evidence against the importance of sunspot plumes came from the uvsp instrument on the _ solar maximum mission - smm_. kingston et al .",
    "( 1982 ) found that the emission measures over the penumbrae were higher than over the umbrae .",
    "the _ smm _ observations led gurman ( 1993 ) to conclude that the umbral transition region was generally indistinguishable from the quiet transition region .",
    "there appears to be at least two possible explanations for the discrepancy between the observations obtained with the s055 _ skylab _ and the uvsp _ smm _ instruments .",
    "one possibility is that sunspot plumes are formed in the upper part of the transition region and therefore are easier observed with s055 than with uvsp .",
    "another possibility is that one type of sunspots have plumes whereas others do not .",
    "the present observations show that sunspot plumes occur both in magnetic unipolar and bipolar active regions and are most apparent in emission lines formed in the upper part of the transition region .",

    "observations of nine sunspot regions ( see table 1 ) were obtained with the normal incidence spectrometer ( nis ) of the coronal diagnostic spectrometer  cds ( harrison et al .",
    "1995 ) , as part of a joint observing program on the solar and heliospheric observatory  soho .",
    "a large fraction of the observing time was used to raster an area of 120@xmath3 120@xmath4 , moving the narrow 2.0@xmath4 spectrometer slit perpendicular to the slit direction in steps of 2.0@xmath4 .",
    "the exposure time was 20 s , each raster was recorded during 25 min and contains information from 60 adjacent locations for ten emission lines .",

    "the line parameters , peak intensity , wavelength shift and line width are determined by a least squares fit to the observations , see brynildsen et al .",
    "the data material consists of line profiles that are well represented by a single gaussian shape .",
    "small regions with complicated line profiles and regions with rapid time evolution are outside the scope of this paper .",

    "1995 ) from soho . to determine the location of regions with peak line intensity @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a preselected value of @xmath8",
    ", we introduce the notations :    @xmath9 = fraction of umbra covered with @xmath6 ,    @xmath10 = fraction of sunspot covered with @xmath6 ,    @xmath11 = fraction of area with @xmath6 located above the umbra ,    @xmath12 = fraction of area with @xmath6 located above the sunspot .",

    "in figures 1 and 2 ( pl.00 and 00 ) the brightest features with peak line intensity @xmath15 are encircled by yellow contours , whereas medium bright features with @xmath16 are encircled by green contours .",
    "below we give our reasons for identifying the brightest feature in noaa 7986 , observed on 29 august 1996 ( see fig .  1 )",
    ", with a sunspot plume . in contrast , figure  2 shows that nearly all the brightest features in noaa 7999 , observed on 28 november 1996 , are located outside the sunspot . the size and the location of the brightest emission features with peak line intensity @xmath15",
    "are given in table 3 for the entire set of observations .",
    "we limit the list to the three emission lines where the sunspot plumes are most apparent .",
    "an excellent illustration of a sunspot plume is presented in figure  2 of foukal et al .",
    "( 1974 ) , based on observations of mcmath region 12543 . to compare the brightest emission feature in noaa 7986 ( fig .",
    "1 ) with that of a sunspot plume let us first consider the variation with the line formation temperature . the line emission in the sunspot plume in mcmath region 12543 exceeds that above the adjacent plage region in o  iv 554  ",
    ", o  vi 1032   , and ne  vii 465   , see figure  3 in foukal et al .",
    "figure  1 shows that the brightest emission above the umbra in noaa 7986 is observed in a compatible temperature range since the brightest emission is observed in o  iv 554   , o  v 629   , and ne  vi 562   .",
    "next consider the spatial extent of the brightest emission . according to foukal et al .",
    "( 1974 ) the plume s `` minimum half - width is definitely smaller than the diameter of the umbra '' .",
    "however , their figure  4 shows that the spatial extent changes from one emission line to another . in ne",
    "vii 465   , where the plume is most apparent , the fwhm of the plume exceeds 30@xmath4 which is considerably larger than the umbral diameter ( @xmath17 10@xmath4 ) .",
    "we find that the size of the bright features in the sunspots of noaa 7986 and mcmath region 12543 are compatible .",
    "based on these comparisons we conclude that the sunspot in noaa 7986 ( fig .",
    "1 ) shows a sunspot plume .",
    "a sunspot plume is located above the sunspot and is the brightest feature within the active region .",
    "it is important to note that both the extent and the location of enhanced line emission depend on the preselected intensity level @xmath7 .",
    "we show in figure  3 the fraction , @xmath12 , of the area with peak line intensity @xmath6 which is located above the sunspot as function of the intensity ratio , @xmath18 . for several active regions",
    "we find that as @xmath18 increases towards the brightest features an increasing fraction of the line emission in o  iv 554   , o  v 629   , and ne  vi 562   is located inside the sunspot .",
    "this means that in a search for sunspot plumes one can not simply look for enhanced line emission , but must select the brightest regions by choosing a criterion , such as , @xmath13 .    if it is required that the sunspot plume must be positioned directly above the umbra , only two of the nine sunspots contain a sunspot plume .",
    "taking into account the measured size of sunspot plumes a more reasonable requirement is that a plume is located in an area above the sunspot that includes the umbra or parts thereof and may extend into the penumbra . with this requirement",
    "the following five sunspots show plumes in o  v 629   and ne  vi 562   : noaa 7973 , 7986 , 8011 , 8073 , and 8085 . in these sunspots",
    "the plumes are centered in the penumbra , the umbra ( see fig .  1 ) , the umbra , the rim of the umbra and the penumbra , respectively .",
    "it is possible that also noaa 8076 should be regarded as containing sunspot plumes since two of the brightest line emission regions in o  v 629   and ne  vi 562   are located within the largest , leading sunspot and the third bright line emission region covers most of a following sunspot , but extends outside the sunspot .",
    "the other three active regions show bright emission both inside and outside the sunspot in ne  vi 562   .",

    "the _ smm _",
    "observations were obtained closer to a sunspot maximum than the present observations .",
    "we can not exclude a selection effect since the sunspots listed by gurman ( 1993 ) are all magnetic bipolar , whereas unipolar sunspots were observed both by foukal et al .",
    "( 1974 ) and by us ( see table  1 )",
    ". however , this can not be the entire explanation since we also observe sunspot plumes in bipolar sunspots .",
    "it appears that the cds instrument is well suited to measure emission lines formed in the upper part of the transition region , where the sunspot plumes are most apparent .",
    "the higher sensitivity of the cds instrument than the uvsp _ smm _ instrument to line emission in this region of the solar atmosphere may be one of the reasons for the difference in results between the two instruments .",
    "the present observations suggest that sunspot plumes are formed in the upper part of the transition region , occur both in magnetic unipolar and bipolar regions , and may extend outside the umbra and into the penumbra .",
