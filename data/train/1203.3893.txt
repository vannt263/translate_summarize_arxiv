    "it is well known that under some circumstances the phenomenology of atomic liquids finds an almost perfect correspondence in the phenomenology of colloidal fluids @xcite .",
    "this seems to be particularly true regarding the rather complex dynamic behavior of these systems as they approach the glass transition @xcite . although it is clear that this analogy has some fundamental limitations ( such as the presence of many - body hydrodynamic interactions in colloidal systems ) , one can be confident , for example , that the phase behavior of colloidal and atomic systems with identical interaction potentials will , of course , be the same . thus",
    ", if one approaches this problem with a dynamic simulation technique , one is confident that the equilibrium phase diagram of a specific system ( say a lennard - jones liquid ) will be independent of the simulation technique employed in its determination ( either molecular or brownian dynamics ) @xcite .",
    "time - dependent and dynamic properties , on the other hand , are expected in general to depend on the specific microscopic transport mechanisms .",
    "nevertheless , some features associated with the collective , long - time behavior of the system also seem to be rather insensitive to the microscopic short - time dynamics .",
    "for example , it has been suspected , and partially corroborated , that for a given model system ( i.e. , same pair potential ) standard molecular dynamics will lead to essentially the same dynamic arrest scenario as brownian dynamics @xcite .",
    "determining the range of validity of this dynamic analogy , however , continues to be a relevant topic in the study of the dynamics of liquids .    from the theoretical side , for example , one would like to have a unified description of the macroscopic dynamics of both , colloidal and atomic liquids , which explicitly exhibits the origin of the similarities and differences in their macroscopic dynamics .",
    "this topic has been addressed in the framework of the mode coupling theory of the ideal glass transition @xcite , originally developed for newtonian liquids , but also adapted to brownian systems .",
    "such attention was focussed on the similarity of the long - time dynamics of newtonian and brownian systems in the neighborhood of the glass transition @xcite .",
    "a number of issues , however , remain open @xcite , one important question referring to the validity and limitations of this long - time similarity under general conditions , such as those involving ordinary thermodynamically stable fluids , and not necessarily associated with the glass transition . in this sense ,",
    "one possible general framework for such theoretical analysis is the concept of the generalized langevin equation ( gle ) @xcite .",
    "the gle formalism describes the dynamics of the thermal fluctuations @xmath1 of the instantaneous value of the macroscopic variables @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , around its equilibrium value @xmath4 , and has the structure of the most general linear stochastic equation with additive noise for the vector @xmath5^{\\dagger } $ ] ( with the dagger indicating transpose ) .",
    "the gle equation has been widely used in the description of thermal fluctuation phenomena in simple liquid systems , and boon and yip s textbook @xcite contains a detailed account of its early use to describe the dynamics of simple liquids .",
    "although this stochastic equation is conventionally associated with the mori - zwanzig projection operator formalism @xcite , in reality its structure is not a consequence of the hamiltonian basis of mori - zwanzig s derivation ; instead , it is essentially equivalent to the mathematical condition of stationarity @xcite",
    ".    understood in the latter manner , the gle formalism was first employed in ref .",
    "@xcite to derive the equation of motion of an individual tracer particle in a colloidal suspension without hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "such an equation reads @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the mass and @xmath8 the velocity of the tracer particle , while @xmath9 is the friction coefficient caused by the frictional resistance of the supporting solvent and @xmath10 the associated random force .",
    "the memory term involving the time - dependent friction function @xmath11 , and its associated random force @xmath12 , are the friction and fluctuating forces that originate in the time - evolution of the cage of surrounding colloidal particles . under well defined approximations , the exact result for the time - dependent friction function @xmath13 derived in ref .",
    "@xcite was shown there to reduce to the following approximate expression in terms of the collective and self intermediate scattering functions ( isfs ) @xmath14 and @xmath15 , @xmath16}{s(k)}\\right ] ^{2}f(k , t)f_s(k , t ) .",

    "this result , together with similarly general expressions for @xmath14 and @xmath15 also derived within the gle formalism @xcite , was later employed in the construction of the self - consistent generalized langevin equation ( scgle ) theory of colloid dynamics @xcite , eventually applied to the description of dynamic arrest phenomena @xcite , and more recently , to the construction of a first - principles theory of equilibration and aging of colloidal glass - forming liquids @xcite .    with the aim of investigating the relationship between the dynamics of atomic and brownian liquids , in this work",
    "we apply the gle formalism to derive the generalized langevin equation that describes the motion of individual tracer particles in simple _ atomic _ liquids , thus extending to these systems the results of ref .",
    "@xcite reviewed above .",
    "the most remarkable prediction of the derivation presented here is that the resulting stochastic equation for the velocity @xmath8 of the atomic tracer turns out to be formally identical to the colloidal case described by the two equations above , with the solvent friction coefficient @xmath20 replaced by a kinetic ( or ` doppler ' ) friction coefficient @xmath21 determined by kinetic - theoretical arguments .    since the concept of kinetic friction may involve a rather subtle use of otherwise simple and well established concepts , we start this paper in section ii by providing a simple and intuitive description of the short - time random motion performed by an individual tracer particle in an _ atomic _ liquid , as a consequence of molecular collisions .",
    "such description exhibits the fact that the resulting random motion must be described by the same stochastic mathematical model that describes the brownian motion of a tracer particle in a colloidal fluid .",
    "this is just the mathematical model underlying the ordinary langevin equation ( eq .",
    "( [ gletracerdif ] ) above without the time - dependent friction term and its associated random force ) .",
    "thus , also in the atomic case , a relaxation time @xmath22 of the velocity , due to the friction force @xmath23 , defines the crossover from ballistic to diffusive motion .",
    "the fundamental difference lies in the physical origin of the friction force @xmath24 and in the determination of the friction coefficient @xmath25 . in a brownian liquid",
    "the friction force @xmath26 is caused by the supporting solvent ; hence , @xmath9 assumes its stokes value .",
    "in contrast , as discussed in section ii , in a newtonian liquid the friction force @xmath24 is not caused by any external material agent but by the unimpeded tendency to establish or restore , through molecular collisions , the equipartition of the energy available for distribution among the kinetic energy degrees of freedom of the system .",
    "thus , the corresponding value of @xmath25 that emerges from these considerations is provided by einstein s relation , with a kinetic - theoretically determined diffusion coefficient .",
    "the discussion of the langevin equation for atomic liquids is continued in sections [ sectioniii ] and [ sectioniv ] , where a more formal and complete derivation is provided .",
    "thus , in section [ sectioniii ] we show that the force on the tracer particle can be written as an integral of the divergence of the stress tensor @xmath27 , whose kinetic component @xmath28 is the origin of the doppler friction force @xmath23 and its associated random force , whereas the term involving the configurational component @xmath29 describes the effects of the ordinary conservative direct forces ( electrostatic , van der waals , etc , ) exerted by the surrounding particles .",
    "it is also seen that the latter effects enter additively in the langevin equation of the atomic liquid , as an integral term that is linear in the instantaneous local density of the surrounding particles . in section [ sectioniv ]",
    "we demonstrate that this linear coupling of the motion of the tracer with the local density of the surrounding particles leads to a time - dependent configurational friction term and to its corresponding random force , thus resulting in a generalized langevin equation for the velocity of a tracer particle , which turns out to be formally identical to its colloidal counterpart in eq .",
    "( [ gletracerdif ] ) .",
    "the main predictions of the resulting generalized langevin equation for atomic liquids are then discussed in section [ sectionv ] .",
    "these include well defined scaling rules that exhibit the identity between the long - time dynamics of atomic and colloidal liquids .",
    "there we test these scalings by comparing the simulation results for a given model system ( the hard sphere fluid ) using both , molecular dynamics and brownian dynamics simulations .",
    "the last section summarizes the most relevant conclusions , and discusses some limitations and potential applications of the results of the paper .",
    "let us consider a simple atomic fluid , formed by @xmath0 spherical particles in a volume @xmath30 whose microscopic dynamics is described by newton s equations , @xmath31 where @xmath7 is the mass and @xmath32 the velocity of the @xmath33th particle at position @xmath34 , and in which the interactions between the particles are represented by a sum of pairwise forces , with @xmath35 being the force exerted on particle @xmath33 by particle @xmath36 .",
    "our general aim is to establish a connection between the microscopic dynamics described by these ( newton s ) equations , and the equation that describes the random motion of any representative individual tracer particle of the liquid .    in this section",
    "we discuss a simple and intuitive ( albeit possibly subtle ) physical picture , which plays a central role in our theoretical effort to establish such connection .",
    "we start by recalling the physical meaning of two fundamental concepts in the dynamics of an atomic fluid , namely , the mean free time , @xmath22 , and the mean free path , @xmath37 , which represent the characteristic time- and length - scales at which the crossover from the short - time ballistic motion of the atoms to their long - time diffusive transport occur .",
    "it is well known @xcite that for correlation times @xmath38 much shorter than @xmath22 , and for distances much shorter than @xmath37 , all the particles move ballistically , so that for @xmath39 , the mean squared displacement ( msd ) is given by @xmath40 , with @xmath41 being the thermal velocity .    for times",
    "@xmath38 much longer than @xmath22 , each particle has undergone many collisions , and its motion can be represented as a sequence of ( ballistic ) random flights of mean length @xmath37 and mean flight - time @xmath22 , traveled at a random velocity that has zero mean and covariance @xmath42 . from the theory of random flights , however , it is well - known @xcite that the motion represented by such a sequence of random displacements , will become diffusive in the long - time limit .",
    "this means that it will be characterized by a mean squared displacement that , for @xmath43 , will increase linearly with time , @xmath44 .",
    "furthermore , the corresponding diffusion coefficient @xmath45 will be given by @xmath46 .",
    "thus , we conclude that the msd of a representative tracer particle will exhibit two well - defined limiting behaviors in two opposite time regimes , namely , it will be ballistic at short times , @xmath40 for @xmath47 , and diffusive at long times , @xmath44 for @xmath48 . the simplest mathematical model that provides a full description of the crossover of @xmath49 from the first to the second of these two exact limits ,",
    "is provided by a gaussian stationary stochastic process , described by a linear stochastic equation with additive noise for the instantaneous velocity @xmath8 of the tracer particle , i.e. , by @xcite @xmath50 with @xmath51 being a  purely random \" ( or  white \" ) noise , i.e. , a stationary and gaussian stochastic process with zero mean ( @xmath52 ) , uncorrelated with the initial value @xmath53 of the velocity fluctuations , and delta - correlated with itself .",
    "in fact , the stationarity condition is in reality equivalent to the fluctuation - dissipation relation between the random and the dissipative terms in eq .",

    "however , there is no supporting solvent to produce friction , and hence , identifying the origin and determining the value of @xmath25 requires slightly more subtle arguments . the simplest manner to describe its physical origin",
    "may be found in uhlenbeck and ornstein s brief reference to the so - called _ doppler _ friction @xcite .",
    "these authors point out that any tracer particle colliding with the particles of a gas , whose size @xmath61 is smaller than the mean free path @xmath62 , will be subjected to doppler friction , caused by the fact that  when the tracer particle is moving , say to the right , will be hit by more molecules from the right than from the left \" . in the following section we shall provide a more formal derivation of this kinetic friction effect . at this point ,",
    "however , we provide simple arguments for its quantitative determination .    to determine @xmath25 in the present case we first notice that the mathematical solution of eq .",
    "( [ langevin0 ] ) for the msd is such that at long times , @xmath63 .",
    "this determines a self - diffusion coefficient @xmath45 in terms of @xmath25 through einstein s relation , @xmath64 .",
    "thus , we must only determine either @xmath25 or @xmath45 .",
    "in our case , we write einstein s relation as @xmath65 and determine @xmath45 independently , borrowing the arguments developed in the elementary kinetic theory of gases @xcite . for this , we recall that @xmath46 , which , since @xmath66 , can be written as @xmath67 .",
    "we then estimate the mean free path @xmath37 to be given by @xmath68 , with @xmath69 and with @xmath61 being the collision diameter of the particles .",

    "this means that there is nothing like a time - scale separation between the crossover from ballistic to diffusive motion and the crossover from free to collective relaxation ( i.e. , from the so - called @xmath113-processes to the slower @xmath114-processes ) .",
    "although this timescale degeneration disappears gradually as the density increases , giving rise to the full separation of time scales characteristic of the approach to the glass transition , this degeneration of time scales is a characteristic feature of atomic dynamics throughout the whole stable liquid phase of these simple systems . to illustrate this , notice that taking @xmath115 and @xmath116 , representative of the freezing conditions of argon , leads to @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119ps , and @xmath120ps .",

    "the crossover from ballistic to diffusive motion ( occurring at very early times @xmath137 ) and the crossover from free to collective difusion ( occurring at times @xmath138 ) , are separated by nearly 8 decades .",
    "thus , if one were interested in observing the ballistic - to - diffusive crossover in our illustrative colloidal suspension , one would have to measure @xmath83 in the time window corresponding to fig . 1 , i.e , for times centered in the regime @xmath139s . this crossover , however , will be completely shifted to unobservable , extremely short times , when probing only the structural relaxation of the colloidal liquid for times @xmath38 in the milisecond range and above ( i.e. , @xmath138 ) .",
    "for this reason in the description of the dynamics of suspensions the inertial term of the langevin equation is normally neglected , @xmath140 , leading to the _ overdamped _ langevin equation , @xmath141 , whose solution for the msd is @xmath142 .",

    "this task is addressed in the following two sections .",
    "the fact that the langevin equation in eq .",

    "the fundamental difference lies in the physical origin of the friction force @xmath23 : in a brownian liquid , this friction is assumed to be caused by an external material agent , namely , the supporting solvent , which also acts as a heat reservoir . in a newtonian liquid , in contrast",
    ", the ( ` doppler ' ) friction force @xmath23 is not caused by any external material agent but by the molecular collisions responsible to impose the equipartition of energy among the kinetic energy degrees of freedom of the system .",
    "in other words , the underlying physical origin of the kinetic friction effects is that for times @xmath38 much longer than @xmath22 , in which each particle has undergone many molecular collisions , the kinetic energy has indeed been distributed according to the most probable distribution .",
    "this then means that partial thermal equilibrium , consisting of this equipartition of the kinetic energy , is achieved within the time scale represented by @xmath22 .",
    "such partial thermalization must involve the transport of heat through molecular collisions .",
    "the instantaneous fluctuations of this local temperature , however , lead to the random force @xmath154 that cause the instantaneous fluctuations in the velocity of the tracer particle .",

    "( [ wdtintdifec ] ) in terms of the scaled time @xmath391 and the scaled msd @xmath392 , to read @xmath393 for dense atomic liquids ( e.g. , hard spheres at @xmath394 ) either choice is perfectly adequate to observe within the same time window both , the crossover from ballistic to diffusive motion and the crossover from free to correlated motion , as illustrated by the simulation results for @xmath83 in fig .",
    "the reason is , of course , that in this case @xmath86 and @xmath112 do not greatly differ from each other , and hence , there is no important time - scale separation .",
    "the situation is , however , dramatically different in the corresponding colloidal liquid since , as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sectionii ] , the ratio @xmath395 may be as small as @xmath396 .",
    "thus , these two crossover timescales are separated by about 8 decades , and can not be analyzed in the same time window .",
    "in fact , this implies that if we focus on the crossover from ballistic to diffusive motion , as in eq .",
    "( [ wdtintdifecstar ] ) , then the term involving the configurational friction will be completely negligible .",
    "in contrast , if we focus on the crossover from free to correlated motion , as in eq .",
    "( [ wdtintdifecstardiff ] ) , then it is the inertial term involving the time derivative of the msd what can be neglected .",
    "this is referred to as the overdamped limit , which also amounts to ignoring the inertial term @xmath397 $ ] on the left side of the gle in eq .",
    "( [ eq6p ] ) .",
    "thus , in this limit eq .",
    "( [ wdtintdifecstardiff ] ) reads @xmath398 this only changes the true short - time limit @xmath399 of the solution of eq .",
    "( [ wdtintdifecstardiff ] ) to @xmath400 , but leaves unaltered the long - time limit @xmath401 .",
    "this equation thus describes the diffusive motion of colloidal tracer particles .",
    "it should also be clear , however , that even though in atomic liquids there is not an appreciable timescale separation , eq .",
    "( [ wdtintdifecstaroverdamped ] ) also describes the long - time motion of atomic tracer particles .",
    "hence , except for the referred short - time differences , the msd of an atomic and a colloidal liquid with the same interactions and the same @xmath19 should be indistinguishable when plotted in terms of these dimensionless units , provided that the intermediate scattering functions @xmath14 and @xmath15 , which enter in the previous expression for @xmath389 above , also share a similar long - time scaling property .",
    "thus , we may embark on a study of these dynamic properties to see if they indeed exhibit the desired scalings , or else , we can check directly if the msd itself exhibits the expected universality of atomic and colloidal liquids .",
    "here we have adopted the second approach , and have compared the molecular and the brownian dynamics simulation data of @xmath83 for the hs system at the volume fractions @xmath97 and 0.5 . for this comparison",
    "we use the same molecular dynamics data as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , now plotted in terms of the dimensionless msd @xmath402 $ ] as a function of the dimensionless time @xmath403 $ ] , and the brownian dynamics data generated for this comparison using the methodology explained in ref .",
    "@xcite . as we can see from this comparison , for each volume fraction the molecular dynamics and",
    "the brownian dynamics data agree at long times , within a high degree of numerical precision .",
    "the short - time difference between the molecular and brownian dynamics simulation data originates , of course , from the fact that the latter are based on the conventional ermak and mccammon s brownian dynamics algorithm @xcite , in which the  overdamped \" limit is previously taken in the microscopic equations of motion .",
    "thus , this agreement is also an indirect indication that the intermediate scattering functions @xmath14 and @xmath15 must also share similar scaling properties . the analysis of this issue , however , is addressed separately @xcite .",
    "$ ] as a function of the dimensionless time @xmath404 $ ] for the volume fractions @xmath97 and 0.5 .",
    "the squares correspond to brownian dynamics simulations @xcite generated as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the circles to the molecular dynamics simulations of fig . 1 . ]",
    "in summary , in this paper we have explained a simple argument that exposes a dynamic equivalence between the long - time dynamic properties of atomic and colloidal liquids .",
    "such simple arguments were complemented by a more formal fundamental derivation of the generalized langevin equation for a tracer particle in an atomic liquid , which is the atomic counterpart of the gle for tracer diffusion derived in ref .",
    "@xcite for colloidal liquids in the absence of hydrodynamic interactions . the dynamic equivalence suggested by the fact that the gle for tracer diffusion in both cases has the same mathematical structure , need in reality that other dynamic properties , such as the intermediate scattering functions @xmath14 and @xmath15 , also share a similar long - time scaling property . for the time being , here we have tested the predicted dynamic equivalence at the level of the mean squared displacement @xmath83 in the context of a specific model system , namely , the hard sphere liquid , in its dynamic version corresponding to molecular and brownian dynamics .",
    "let us state , however , that the present work does not settle the question of the generality of this dynamic equivalence .",
    "instead , it only contributes to stimulate the corresponding discussion .",
    "for example , it is important to discuss the manifestation of this dynamic equivalence on properties other than the msd . as indicated above , verifying that similar scalings are exhibited by the intermediate scattering functions @xmath14 and @xmath15 is an issue that must still be addressed in detail .",
    "in fact , our group has already approached this issue within the gle formalism @xcite , and the results turn out to be completely consistent with those of the present paper .",
    "the atomic - to - brownian long - time dynamic equivalence thus seems to be a very robust prediction .",
    "the most relevant implications of this dynamic equivalence have been corroborated by the systematic comparisons between molecular and brownian dynamics simulations of the sort illustrated in this paper .",
    "a summary of this analysis has been advanced in a recent brief communication @xcite .",
    "another important issue refers to the actual universality of the atomic - colloidal dynamic equivalence discussed in this paper , since the only validation of these predictions involved a specific model system , namely , the hard sphere fluid .    in this direction , let us mention that the present colloidal  atomic dynamic correspondence is not restricted to the hard - sphere fluid , but it actually extends over to systems with soft repulsive interactions .",
    "this is a direct result of combining the present colloidal  atomic correspondence for the hard sphere system , with another important scaling rule , which derives from the principle of dynamic equivalence between soft - sphere and hard - sphere liquids @xcite .",
    "the extension of this scaling to atomic systems is immediate once the collision diameter @xmath61 entering in the expression for @xmath405 in eq .",
    "( [ dkinetictheory ] ) is given a proper definition @xcite for the soft - sphere potential @xmath342 considered .",
    "still another issue refers to the possible limitations of this long - time dynamic equivalence , imposed by the fact that the present derivation apparently assumed colloidal systems in the absence of hydrodynamic interactions . in reality , however , the validity of this dynamic equivalence should extend over to systems with hydrodynamic interactions , provided that the corresponding effects enter only through the value of the short - time self - diffusion coefficient @xmath366 , as suggested in @xcite .",
    "other interesting directions along which to question the applicability and universality of this dynamic equivalence refers to the realm of liquid mixtures and to the effects of attractive interactions .",
    "the answer to these questions , however , will only come from the comparison between the dynamic properties of atomic and colloidal liquids , similar to that presented here in fig .",
