    "let @xmath5 be a sequence of independent @xmath6 random matrices and @xmath7 in a celebrated paper furstenbergkesten60 , furstenberg and kesten proved that @xmath8 converges provided that @xmath9 later , oseledec in @xcite proved convergence for other singular values of @xmath10 and cohen and newman in @xcite studied the behavior of the limit in the situation when @xmath1 approaches infinity .",
    "this paper investigates the question of how the speed of convergence depends on the dimension of matrices @xmath1 .",
    "consider a dynamical system ( a gas , an economy , an ecosystem , etc . ) .",
    "its evolution can be described by a mapping @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a vector that describes the state of the system at time @xmath13 we can often model the mapping as a multiplication by a random matrix @xmath14 stability and other long - run properties of the system depend on the growth in the norm of the product @xmath15 which we can measure by calculating the quantity @xmath16    the sub - multiplicativity property of the norm ( @xmath17 ) ensures that @xmath18 converges to @xmath19 where @xmath20 is an arbitrary vector .",
    "intuitively , this means that it is not important what was the starting vector of the system . after some time , all products grow at the same rate independently of the initial state .",
    "it is of interest to investigate whether this erasure of memory about the initial state occurs slower in more complex systems , that is , in systems , which are described by matrices of larger size .",
    "of course , when we compare long - run properties of systems , we should only look at the systems that are comparable in the short run , that is , the system that have comparable one - step behavior .",
    "roughly , the difference between one - step growth of a specially - chosen and a random vector can be measured by the ratio of @xmath21 to @xmath22 where @xmath1 is the dimension of the matrix @xmath23 indeed , @xmath21 is the square of the maximal possible increase in the length of the state vector , and @xmath24 is the average of the squared singular values of @xmath25 hence it can be considered as a measure of the increase in the length of a random state vector .    hence , if we want systems to be comparable in the short run , then we should restrict this ratio by a constant that does not depend on the dimension of the system .",
    "( otherwise , some directions may become more and more unusual as the dimension of the system grows . )",
    "we will call this property uniform boundedness of singular values .",
    "we also want to look at sufficiently symmetric systems , that is , systems without preferential directions .",
    "we codify this by requiring that matrices @xmath26 are rotationally invariant , that is , the distribution of matrix elements does not depend on the choice of basis .",
    "the main result of this paper is that under these assumptions the speed with which the memory of the initial state is erased does not decrease as the dimension of the system grows .    intuitively , the asymptotic behavior of @xmath27 depends on three factors .",
    "first of all , for a fixed vector @xmath28@xmath29for a certain sequence of vectors @xmath30 and this averaging is likely to concentrate the distribution of @xmath31 this factor does not depend on the dimension @xmath1 . on the other hand , we are interested in the convergence of the supremum of @xmath32 over all @xmath33 and to ensure the convergence of this supremum we have to make sure that variables @xmath32 are all close to the limit @xmath34 for a sufficiently dense set of vectors @xmath35 the number of elements in such a set is likely to grow exponentially in @xmath36 and this might make the convergence of @xmath37 slower for large @xmath38    the third factor appears because for every fixed vector @xmath28 the norm @xmath39 becomes concentrated around some particular value as @xmath40 this factor is likely to speed up the convergence of @xmath41 and therefore of @xmath42    we will show in this paper that the third factor dominates and the speed of convergence of @xmath37 is not slowed down by the growth in the dimension  @xmath1 .",
    "previously , the speed of convergence in the furstenberg ",
    "kesten theorem was investigated in @xcite and guivarchraugi85 .",
    "they proved a central limit theorem for @xmath43 and studied large deviations of @xmath8 for a large class of random matrices .",
    "however , the results in these papers do not provide effectively computable bounds on the rate of convergence in limit theorems , and , as a consequence , do not help us to investigate how the speed of convergence changes as the dimension of matrices grows .",
    "one of the contributions of this paper is deriving more explicit bounds on the speed of convergence in limit theorems .",
    "let us describe the problem in a more formal fashion .",
    "consider independent identically - distributed @xmath1-by-@xmath1 matrices @xmath44 we are interested in the behavior of the norm of the product @xmath45 and we will make the following assumptions about matrices @xmath46 .",
    "first of all , we assume that random matrices @xmath46 are rotationally invariant ; that is , the distribution of their entries does not depend on the choice of coordinates .",
    "formally , we use the following definition .",
    "a random matrix @xmath47 is rotationally invariant if for every integer @xmath48 for every collection of vectors @xmath49 , @xmath50 and for every orthogonal matrix @xmath51 the joint distributions of random vectors @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the same .",
    "[ aa ] matrices @xmath54 are rotationally invariant .",
    "we also impose an assumption needed for the validity of the furstenberg  kesten theorem .",
    "[ ab ] for all @xmath36 @xmath55 exists .",
    "second , we restrict our study to two important cases .",
    "the first one is the case of ( real ) gaussian matrices @xmath46 , that is , independent random @xmath1-by-@xmath1 matrices with independent entries distributed according to the gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance @xmath56 that is , as @xmath57    the second case is that of independent rotationally invariant @xmath1-by-@xmath1 matrices @xmath46 that satisfy the following assumptions .",
    "let @xmath58 be the eigenvalues of @xmath59 ( i.e. , squared singular values of @xmath46 ) , and let @xmath60(we will sometimes omit superscripts to lighten the notation . )",
    "[ ac ] with probability 1 , @xmath61 where the constant @xmath62 does not depend on @xmath38    in other form , assumption  [ ac ] says that @xmath63 with probability 1 .",
    "[ ad ] @xmath64 $ ] exists and bounded by a constant which does not depend on @xmath38    one example of a matrix family that satisfies these assumptions is hermitian matrices @xmath46 which are generated in the following way .",
    "sample @xmath1 independent values from a distribution supported on @xmath65 , $ ] where @xmath66 and construct a diagonal matrix @xmath67 by putting these values on the main diagonal .",
    "then take a haar - distributed random orthogonal matrix @xmath68 and define @xmath46 as @xmath69 a sequence of these matrices ( with independent @xmath70 ) will satisfy all the assumptions .    the main result is as follows .",
    "[ theorem_uniform_convergence_norm_products]let @xmath71 be independent , identically distributed @xmath6 matrices , which satisfy assumptions [ aa ] and [ ab ] and which are either gaussian with independent entries @xmath72 or satisfy assumptions [ ac ] and [ ad ] .",
    "let @xmath73 and let @xmath74 be an arbitrary unit vector .",
    "then @xmath37 converges in probability to @xmath75 and the convergence is uniform in @xmath38 that is , for each @xmath76 there exists an @xmath77 such that for all @xmath78 and all @xmath79 @xmath80    the assumptions of the theorem are sufficient but not necessary .",
    "the assumption that @xmath81 is used in the proof of proposition [ proposition_ld_inequality_unbounded_rv ] below , where it is used to estimate the probability of large deviations of @xmath82 and to show that the rate in the corresponding exponential inequality is proportional to @xmath38 it is likely that this assumption can be somewhat relaxed by requiring instead that @xmath83 .",
    "one particular implication of the assumption @xmath81 is that the bound on singular values does not depend on the dimension of the matrix . in order to understand this assumption better ,",
    "consider the following example .",
    "let @xmath84where @xmath85 is a haar - distributed row @xmath1-dimensional vector , and @xmath86 is a haar - distributed column @xmath1-dimensional vector .",
    "( vectors @xmath85 and @xmath87 are assumed to be independent . )",
    "then the squared singular values of @xmath5 are all zero except one , which equals @xmath38 hence , @xmath88 and @xmath89 we can conclude that assumptions [ aa ] , [ ab ] and [ ad ] are satisfied , and assumption [ ac ] is not satisfied .    next , consider @xmath90 where @xmath74 is an arbitrary vector .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath91 is distributed as the first coordinate of a haar - distributed vector @xmath92 in other words @xmath91 is distributed as @xmath93where @xmath94 are independent standard gaussian variables .",
    "then it is clear that @xmath95    next , let us compute @xmath96 note that @xmath97and @xmath98 hence , @xmath99where @xmath91 are independent and distributed as @xmath100 above .",
    "hence , @xmath91 converges in distribution to @xmath101 as @xmath40 it is clear that @xmath102 in probability as @xmath103 therefore , for large @xmath36 @xmath104this bias term can not be made small uniformly in @xmath1 by an increase in @xmath105 this means that the claim of theorem theorem_uniform_convergence_norm_products fails in this case .",
    "later , in section [ section_necessity ] , we will prove a necessary condition for the uniform convergence by using the basic idea of this example .    in order to understand the role of the rotational invariance assumption ,",
    "consider the following example .",
    "let @xmath5 be independent , identically distributed , diagonal matrices .",
    "the diagonal elements of a matrix @xmath5 are independent bernoulli variables that take values @xmath106 and @xmath62 .",
    "that is , a diagonal element takes the value @xmath107 with probability @xmath108 and the value @xmath109 with probability @xmath110 assume that @xmath111    it is easy to see that the norm of @xmath112 is given by the following expression:@xmath113where @xmath114 and @xmath115 are independent random variables with the binomial distribution @xmath116    taking the logarithm and dividing by @xmath117 we get @xmath118where @xmath119 note that as @xmath120 grows , each @xmath121 approaches the gaussian distribution @xmath122    if @xmath1 is fixed , then @xmath123 however , if @xmath1 grows simultaneously with @xmath117 then the limit of @xmath37 may be nonexistent , or may depend on the speed of growth in @xmath1 relative to the speed of growth in @xmath105 hence , the conclusion of theorem theorem_uniform_convergence_norm_products is invalid in this case .",
    "it is an interesting problem whether the assumption of rotational invariance can be relaxed so that the result in theorem theorem_uniform_convergence_norm_products holds for a larger class of matrices , for example , for matrices with i.i.d .",
    "non - gaussian entries ( i.e. , wigner matrices )",
    ". however , this problem appears to be hard since at this moment very little is known about effective bounds on the rate of convergence in the furstenberg ",
    "kesten theorem .",
    "let me now explain two results which will be used as tools in the proof of theorem [ theorem_uniform_convergence_norm_products ] .",
    "the proofs of these results will be given in later sections .",
    "our main tool is the following proposition .",
    "[ proposition_ld_inequality_unbounded_rv ] suppose that all @xmath5 are gaussian with independent entries @xmath124 .",
    "then for all sufficiently small @xmath125 , all @xmath126 and all @xmath127 @xmath128 suppose that i.i.d .",

    "the proof of this proposition will be given in section [ section_large_deviation_bound ] .",
    "the other tool is as follows .",
    "let a set of points on the unit sphere in @xmath135 be called an @xmath136-net if the sphere is covered by spherical caps with centers at these points and angular radius @xmath137    [ proposition_norm_and_sup]let @xmath138 be an arbitrary @xmath1-by-@xmath1 matrix .",
    "suppose that the endpoints of vectors @xmath30 form an @xmath139-net of the unit sphere in @xmath135 . then for all sufficiently small @xmath139 , @xmath140    this proposition allows us to control the matrix norm @xmath141 by the norms of vectors @xmath142 where @xmath30 runs through a finite set of values .",

    "this proposition is useful in conjunction with the following result about the size of sphere coverings . by lemma 2.6 on page 7 of milmanschechtman01 , for @xmath139 smaller than a certain constant",
    ", there exists an @xmath139-net with cardinality @xmath146    now let us prove theorem [ theorem_uniform_convergence_norm_products ] by using propositions [ proposition_ld_inequality_unbounded_rv ] and proposition_norm_and_sup .",
    "proof of theorem [ theorem_uniform_convergence_norm_products ] we focus on the case when assumptions [ ac ] and [ ad ] hold .",
    "the proof for the case of gaussian matrices goes along a similar route and it is simpler .",
    "first of all , note that is enough to prove that ( [ inequality_theorem ] ) holds for all sufficiently large @xmath36 that is , for all @xmath147 indeed , for each @xmath148 we can apply results in @xcite and find that inequality ( [ inequality_theorem ] ) holds if @xmath149 hence , inequality ( inequality_theorem ) holds for all @xmath150 provided that @xmath151    we will choose an appropriate @xmath152 later .",
    "we are going to prove that for all sufficiently large @xmath1 and @xmath120 [ i.e. , @xmath153 and all @xmath154 , it is true that @xmath155 let vectors @xmath156 @xmath157 form a @xmath158-net on the unit sphere .",
    "then , by using propositions proposition_norm_and_sup and [ proposition_ld_inequality_unbounded_rv ] , the union bound and the estimate on the number of elements in the net we obtain @xmath159 where @xmath160 is a certain constant .",

    "next , let @xmath170 since variance of @xmath171 is bounded above by a finite constant which does not depend on @xmath1 ( assumption [ ad ] ) , therefore we can find such @xmath172 that for all @xmath173 it is true that @xmath174 for all @xmath38    it follows that for all @xmath175 and @xmath176 it is true that @xmath177 note that by the furstenberg ",

    "this implies that for all such @xmath36 and for all @xmath181 the following inequality holds : @xmath182 otherwise , the sum of the events in ( [ inequality_proof_4 ] ) and ( inequality_proof_5 ) would cover all probability space and hence the sum of probabilities in ( [ inequality_proof_4 ] ) and ( [ inequality_proof_5 ] ) , @xmath183 would have to be greater then 1 .",
