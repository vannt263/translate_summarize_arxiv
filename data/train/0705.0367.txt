    "in an analysis of the luminosity distances of type  ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) , @xcite ( hereafter j07 ) presented evidence for an offset between the hubble constant measured from sne  ia with @xmath4 km s@xmath5 and from those with @xmath6 km s@xmath5 . specifically , the more distant sne are slightly fainter than one would expect , implying a high local value of @xmath7 .",
    "one natural explanation is a `` hubble bubble ''  a local monopole in the peculiar velocity field , perhaps caused by a local void in the mass density .",
    "the analysis of j07 was carried out using the most recent manifestation of the mlcs light - curve fitter , mlcs2k2 , and found @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath9 method @xcite gives similar results .",
    "in contrast , galaxy - cluster distances give @xmath10 @xcite , which is marginally inconsistent with the sn result ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "earlier studies using sne  ia can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a hubble bubble could have serious implications for precision sn  ia cosmology programs .    in this letter",
    "we test the evidence for the hubble bubble using three other light - curve analysis packages : salt @xcite , salt2 @xcite , and an unpublished package developed for the 3rd year supernova legacy survey ( snls , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) data ( sifto ) .",
    "an analysis of the same data set with these tools does not support a bubble if sn data are used to derive the relationship between sn color excess and peak luminosity , but does if this relationship is required to be that of milky way - like dust .",
    "therefore the question of the hubble bubble is one of the nature of sn colors .",
    "a similar result was found independently by @xcite .",
    "a considerable amount of effort has been devoted to the question of how to best fit sn  ia light curves .",
    "the goal is to measure the relative luminosity distance of different sne , usually after correcting for the width - luminosity and color - luminosity relationships .",
    "these approaches differ considerably in implementation and assumptions , but generally produce very similar results when used to estimate the cosmological density parameters ( @xmath12 ) @xcite .    in this analysis",
    "we consider four fitting packages : mlcs2k2 , as well as three packages developed for use with snls : sifto , salt , and salt2 .",
    "the latter three are more similar to each other than to mlcs2k2 .",
    "the details of sifto will be presented elsewhere ( sullivan et  al . , in preparation ) ; it is broadly similar to salt except that the color excess relation is not imposed during the light - curve fit , but rather when the results of the fit are converted into a distance estimate .",
    "the critical issue for the question of the hubble bubble relates to how the different fitters handle sn color excesses .",
    "all of the models have two parameters : one that describes the light - curve shape , and one the color , both of which affect the peak luminosity . for mlcs2k2",
    "these are @xmath13 and @xmath14 , for salt they are @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "these have different technical meanings , but essentially describe the same effects .",
    "mlcs2k2 breaks the color relation into two pieces : a time - independent piece depends on the sed , so the effects of this term are weakly time - dependent . ] , parameterized by @xmath14 , and a time - dependent piece determined by the shape of the light curve , @xmath13 . the time independent piece is assumed to follow the ccm @xcite dust extinction law . in effect , @xmath14 parameterizes the color of the sn after correction for a shape - color relation .",
    "salt follows a similar prescription , with some critical differences .",
    "the wavelength behavior of the time - independent piece ( parameterized by @xmath16 ) is derived as part of the salt training process ; the results are shown in @xcite .",
    "this relation is reasonably similar to the ccm law , and is arbitrarily normalized so that @xmath16 is the @xmath17 color at peak luminosity ( plus a small constant ) for any @xmath15 ; the same is not true of @xmath18 and @xmath19 , which are functions of @xmath15 . in the following we refer to the time - independent piece as the color excess relation .",
    "the real difference is how the color excess relation is used to correct the peak luminosities .",
    "mlcs2k2 makes the simplest assumption  that it is due to dust .",
    "the wavelength behavior of the ccm law is parameterized by the ratio of selective to total extinction ( @xmath20 ) , and this is also used to convert the color excess into the magnitude correction .",
    "the other fitters considered here take a different approach .",
    "one of the steps in the process of turning their results into a distance estimate is to empirically measure the slope of the relationship between the color @xmath16 and the luminosity correction ( @xmath1 ) , as well as between the light - curve shape and luminosity ( @xmath21 ) by minimizing the residuals with respect to the hubble line . here the model for the predicted peak @xmath22 magnitude",
    "@xmath23 is @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the absolute peak magnitude , @xmath26 is the luminosity distance , and @xmath21 and @xmath1 are determined from sn data ; the slopes can be cleanly separated from the intercept without any difficulties . in this formulation , the shape - color relation is absorbed into the @xmath21 coefficient , and therefore the @xmath1 correction only applies to the color excess . in this analysis",
    "we generally work with @xmath22 magnitudes , and therefore if the color excess relation is purely due to dust then we expect @xmath27 .",
    "interestingly , the current constraint on @xmath1 from combined snls and low - z data is @xmath28 , which differs from 4 by @xmath29 .",
    "a similar value was found by @xcite .",
    "what does @xmath30 mean ?",
    "if @xmath1 is interpreted as arising from dust , then this would require @xmath31 , which is extreme .",
    "on the other hand , we know that dust _ must _ be present at some level .",
    "one possible explanation is that the various color parameters are actually measuring some combination of two effects : dust , as well as some additional intrinsic color variations that are not related to @xmath13 or @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath1 for this additional piece is not known , but if it is less than the value for dust , then the effective combined value will be driven down .",
    "this additional color parameter could be interpreted as additional scatter in the measured colors of sn  ia ; most of the fitters studied here ( except salt ) do include terms for such scatter , but assume that it has no effect on the overall luminosity ( @xmath32 ) . a worry ,",
    "then , is that the relative balance of dust and the additional intrinsic color might vary between sne in different environments .",
    "alternatively , it is possible that the dust along the line of sight to some sne  ia is different than standard dust , perhaps due to scattering effects local to the sn @xcite .",
    "the data sample used in the analysis of j07 incorporates a number of sn with sparsely sampled light curves .",
    "we have placed the following additional requirements on our sample : first we require at least one rest frame @xmath22 observation within @xmath33 days of the estimated @xmath22 peak , in order to ensure that @xmath23 is well measured , and at least one @xmath34 or @xmath35 observation within -7 to + 10 days for the color .",
    "we exclude all sn with @xmath36 or @xmath37 , since these are outside the model bounds for most of the fitters .",
    "finally , we require that @xmath38 mag as calculated from the dust maps of @xcite and @xmath39 mag , both to avoid regions of anomalous dust .",
    "this reduces the sample of 95 sn used by j07 to 61 objects .",
    "since only mlcs2k2 is trained to fit @xmath40 data , we remove this from all fits . in order to check that this reduction in the sample does not affect the results ,",
    "we then refit all of these sn using the most recent version of mlcs2k2 .",
    "we find good agreement with j07 , with @xmath41 for @xmath42 km s@xmath5 and assuming a flat @xmath43 @xmath44cdm universe .",
    "we then fit the same photometry using the other light - curve packages .",
    "the different packages show impressive agreement in their basic derived light - curve parameters , as demonstrated in figure  [ fig : salt2_mlcs_color ] . in order to measure @xmath45with salt / salt2/sifto",
    ", we must determine @xmath1 .",
    "this is calculated from the sn data , but incorporating high - redshift snls data as well .",
    "salt , salt2 , and sifto give @xmath46 1.82 , 1.75 and 2.31 , respectively , with errors of about @xmath47 .",
    "the different values are not particularly important for the current analysis ; all three can be fixed to the mean value without qualitatively changing the results .",
    "after applying the color and light - curve shape corrections , we obtain @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50  in other words , they do not support a hubble bubble if @xmath1 is fit to the data .",
    "salt and mlcs2k2 are compared in figure  [ fig : deltah ] for various values of @xmath51 .",
    "the exact values are somewhat sensitive to the cuts applied to the sample .",
    "however , it requires considerable hand tuning to find regions of parameter space where any of the fitters besides mlcs2k2 detect a hubble bubble at greater than @xmath52 , and in all cases mlcs2k2 gives much greater significance .",
    "one might be tempted to interpret this as an error in one or more of the packages .",
    "however , the actual cause is more interesting : if one sets @xmath53 for salt / salt2/sifto , they _ do _ find evidence for a hubble bubble at @xmath54 , as shown in figure  [ fig : deltahbeta ] .",
    "the color model for the most recent version of @xmath9 , which also favors the bubble , is similar to that of mlcs2k2 .",
    "the question of the hubble bubble therefore boils down to the appropriate value of @xmath1  is it the @xmath55 of milky way - like dust , or is something more complicated going on ?",
    "the value of @xmath1 is relevant because the nearby portion of the low - z sn sample is redder than the distant portion ( figure  [ fig : malmquist ] ) .",
    "this is probably due to malmquist bias @xcite or other selection effects , since redder sne are fainter and harder to detect .",
    "the effects of the color correction are to make the blue sne dimmer and the red sne brighter ( relatively ) .",
    "malmquist bias has little effect as long as the appropriate value of @xmath1 is applied across the whole sample ; however , if the right value is @xmath56 and instead 4 is used , then the distant portion will be made too faint , and the nearby portion too bright , which is exactly the effect observed in j07 .",
    "mlcs2k2 usually includes a prior on @xmath14 , and the default version does not take into account the redshift - dependent effects of malmquist bias .",
    "adjusting the prior to reflect this increases the value of @xmath45 .",
    "[ sec : beta ] if , in fact , @xmath57 ( i.e. , it is purely dust ) , then we should note that a large range of @xmath58 values have been observed in different environments",
    ". however , a sample mean value of @xmath31 would be quite surprising @xcite , even with selection effects .",
    "most previous studies of large samples of sne  ia have found @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "this value weakens the evidence for the hubble bubble slightly to @xmath60 .",
    "our empirical values for @xmath1 were calculated in a model that assumed a smooth local hubble flow .",
    "it is possible that this could be artificially suppressing @xmath45 , so we checked this by refitting @xmath1 using only high - z snls sn , only the low - z sn below @xmath51 , and simultaneously with our fits to @xmath45 .",
    "these give essentially the same result ( @xmath61 ) , albeit with larger errors than the full sample .",
    "therefore , @xmath1 is robust against the presence of a hubble bubble .",
    "monte carlo studies indicate that the bias in @xmath1 ( @xmath62 ) due to errors in the measurement uncertainties and covariances is @xmath63 for fairly extreme cases .",
    "we can also analyze the results of the mlcs2k2 fits using the @xmath1 framework .",
    "this differs from what is meant in j07 by fitting @xmath20 , which enforces a certain relation between the wavelength dependence and scaling of the color excess relation .",
    "we first remove the extinction correction from the mlcs2k2 distance estimates , then convert @xmath14 into @xmath64 using @xmath20 , and finally use this to fit for the value of @xmath1 by minimizing the residuals with respect for the hubble line via a @xmath65 term .",
    "we work in @xmath22 , and find @xmath66 , which again should be compared with the expected value of 4.1 . restricting the fit to only sne below @xmath51 does not change the results .",
    "the fits are shown in figure  [ fig : betafits ] .",
    "another technique for estimating the amount of extinction is to use late time ( @xmath67 days after peak ) color measurements .",
    "the idea is that at late times all sne  ia have a simple relationship between intrinsic color and epoch , and this can be used to measure extinction ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter p99 ) . the evidence for this",
    "is based on a handful of sn for which there is independent evidence for low extinction , and the distribution of the measured late - time colors ( j07 , figure  6 ) .",
    "a version of this is used in the training process of mlcs2k2 .",
    "this suggests one more test of @xmath1 .",
    "we take the subsample of our 61 sne that have late - time color measurements ( from j07 ) and use these values as our color estimate to fit for @xmath1 . carrying out this analysis out for all four fitters , we find @xmath68 for 37 sne . in order to eliminate any `` cross - talk '' between the color parameters and the peak magnitudes",
    ", we also tested this procedure using only @xmath22 band data to fit the peak magnitude and light - curve shape and obtained the same results .",
    "using the late - time colors provided by p99 gives @xmath69 for 28 sne .",
    "these results again differ considerably from the expectation of 4.1 .",
    "we have demonstrated that the sn  ia evidence for a hubble bubble is related to how sn colors are modeled .",
    "all of the approaches considered agree that the wavelength dependence of the color excess relation is similar to that of dust , but disagree on whether or not the relation between the measured color excess and the peak luminosity is also dust - like .",
    "our fits give a value of @xmath61 , which if interpreted via the ccm dust law , requires the extreme value @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , either a more complicated model of intrinsic sn colors is required , which goes beyond a single light - curve shape - color relation , or dust in the host galaxies of sne  ia is quite atypical of milky way dust .",
    "if the former , then the late - time colors of sne  ia vary from sn to sn , and therefore do not provide a simple measure of extinction . if one does favor the single - parameter model with galactic dust , then the evidence for the hubble bubble from sne  ia is fairly strong .",
    "these results depend on how accurately the light - curve shape - intrinsic color relationship has been modeled , so it is reassuring that the four fitters are in approximate agreement on the value of @xmath1 .    requiring an additional intrinsic color relation beyond the shape - color relation",
    "raises some challenges for sn research .",
    "unless this relation can be disentangled from dust , we must consider the possibility that the balance of the two effects will change with environment and redshift , perhaps even within the low - z sample , and affect precision sn cosmology .",
    "mlcs2k2 might require a more sophisticated prior that takes into account the relation between extinction , light - curve shape , intrinsic color , and would also have to allow for any effects of this intrinsic color on sn luminosity .",
    "salt / salt2/sifto might require different values of @xmath1 in different environments or for different color thresholds .",
    "using an inappropriate value of @xmath1 will mostly affect the most distant sn in any survey , where malmquist bias is important .",
    "the potential systematic for a given sn survey can be evaluated by multiplying the uncertainty in @xmath1 by the change in color excess across the sample .",
    "if the two - component color model is correct , then constraining it will not be a trivial task , but it does hold out the possibility of making sne  ia even better standard candles .",
    "how can we resolve this issue ?",
    "a deeper nearby supernova sample that has a similar color distribution at all distances out to @xmath71 km s@xmath5 would provide a good test of the hubble bubble , since an incorrect value of @xmath1 would no longer introduce such an effect .",
    "note that sn cosmology analyses that restrict themselves to @xmath72 such as @xcite are not strongly affected by the existence of the bubble . determining",
    "if a more complicated color model is necessary requires a different approach .",
    "a larger sample of sne in low - extinction environments ( like elliptical galaxies ) , or at least in a narrow color range , could be used to search for a non - dust - like color relation .",
    "a wider baseline of color measurements could also help this problem ; it seems unlikely that the wavelength dependence of the color excess relationship will continue to look like dust at all wavelengths unless it really is dust .",
    "the salt / salt2 color excess relationship @xcite displays tantalizing hints of departures from the ccm law .",
    "if these can be conclusively demonstrated , it would at least prove that there is more going on than milky way - like dust , even if it might not elucidate the underlying mechanism .",
