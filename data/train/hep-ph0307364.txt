    "in supersymmetric models with r - parity violation ( rpv ) @xcite the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is unstable and decays",
    ". thus astrophysical constraints on its nature @xcite no longer apply and a priori _ any _ susy particle could be the lsp . on the other hand , most studies of lsp phenomenology at accelerators in rpv models up to now have concentrated on a ) the lightest neutralino @xcite or b ) a charged scalar ( most probably the right scalar tau ) @xcite being the lsp .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to study the phenomenology of the remaining lsp candidates ( charginos , gluinos , scalar quarks and scalar neutrinos ) at future colliders for the case where r - parity is broken by bilinear terms only .",
    "arguably at present the main motivation to study rpv susy models is the astonishing _",
    "experimental _ progress in neutrino physics in the past few years .",
    "super - k observations of atmospheric neutrinos @xcite , solar neutrino measurements by the sno collaboration @xcite and the reactor anti - neutrino experiment kamland @xcite have finally established non - zero neutrino masses and mixings beyond any reasonable doubt .",
    "bilinear rpv ( brpv ) susy models necessarily produce majorana neutrino masses and indeed in @xcite it was shown that brpv susy can explain current neutrino data , once 1-loop corrections are carefully taken into account .",
    "can one test brpv susy being the origin of neutrino masses and mixings ?",
    "conventional wisdoms says , if susy is to solve the gauge hierarchy problem , superpartners should be found at the next generation of colliders . in general",
    ", the only predictable difference between r - parity conserving and r - parity violating susy then would be a decaying lsp .",
    "given the relatively small number of free parameters in brpv susy , however , one can go further and from measured data on neutrino properties _ predict _ several decay properties of the lsp .",
    "this was shown for the case of the neutralino being lsp in @xcite and for charged scalar lsps in @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "interesting relations between certain decay patterns and low - energy neutrino data have been found .",
    "the most important are : ( i ) the ratio @xmath4 and ( ii ) @xmath5 .    the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) @xcite contains more than a hundred free parameters , most of which are soft susy breaking masses and phases .",
    "supplementing the mssm with universal msugra boundary conditions @xcite reduces this number to just four free parameters plus an undetermined sign ( in addition to the standard model parameters ) .",
    "these are given at the grand unification ( gut ) scale as : @xmath6 , the common scalar mass , @xmath7 , the gaugino mass , and @xmath8 , the common trilinear parameter .",
    "in addition one usually chooses @xmath9 and the sign of the higgs mixing term @xmath10 as free parameters .",
    "parameters at the electro - weak scale can then be calculated from rge running , reducing considerably the available parameter space .",
    "in such a constrained version of the mssm ( cmssm ) one finds essentially only two lsp candidates , namely , the lightest neutralino and the right sleptons , in particular the right scalar tau if @xmath11 is large .",
    "arguably it is this theoretical prejudice why also in rpv models other possibilities so far have attracted little attention .",
    "models which depart from strict msugra in one way or another , however , can be found in the literature .",
    "just to mention a few representative examples , there are string inspired models where supersymmetry breaking is triggered not only by the dilaton fields but also by moduli fields @xcite . in @xmath12 or @xmath13 models , where all neutral gauge bosons , except those forming @xmath14 and @xmath15 , have masses of the order of @xmath16 one expects additional d - term contributions to the sfermion mass parameters at @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "this is equivalent to assuming non - universal values of @xmath6 for left - sleptons , right - sleptons , left - squarks and right squarks , giving rise e.g.  to sneutrino lsps . in gauge",
    "mediated supersymmetry breaking ( gmsb ) models @xcite exists the possibility , that the gluino is the lsp @xcite . in amsb models",
    "@xcite one can find parameter regions where the chargino is the lsp ( nearly mass degenerate with the lightest neutralino ) .    to be as general as possible , however , in this work we will not resort to any specific model of susy breaking .",
    "instead we will simply point out in which way one has to depart from msugra to obtain the corresponding lsp and then proceed to calculate its decay properties . to summarize our main result",
    "it can be said that independent of which susy particle is the lsp there is at least one ratio of decay branching ratios which is fixed by either the solar or the atmospheric neutrino angle , i.e. independent of the lsp nature , brpv susy as the origin of neutrino masses is testable at future colliders .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we will recapitulate the main features of the bilinear r - parity violating model .",
    "then we will turn to the numerical calculations .",
    "decays of squarks , gluinos , charginos and scalar neutrinos will be discussed in detail . before concluding with a short summary",
    ", we will argue that also in case of gmsb @xcite , brpv susy remains testable due to the decay patterns of the nlsp .",
    "bilinear r - parity breaking supersymmetry has been discussed extensively in the literature @xcite .",
    "we will therefore summarize only the main features of the model here , with emphasis on neutrino physics .",
    "the lagrangian of the model is obtained by adding bilinear terms breaking lepton number to the mssm superpotential : @xmath17 and consistently the corresponding terms to the soft susy breaking potential : @xmath18 the latter induce vacuum expectation values @xmath19 for the sneutrinos which are in turn responsible for mixing between standard model particles with supersymmetric particles : higgs bosons with sleptons , charged leptons with charginos and , most importantly for the following considerations , neutrinos with neutralinos .",
    "the mixing of neutrinos with neutralinos gives rise to one massive neutrino at tree level .",
    "the other two neutrinos obtain masses due to loop effects @xcite . assuming that the heaviest neutrino obtains its mass at tree level",
    ", the main features relevant for our current purpose are the following .",
    "the mass of the heaviest neutrino is given by : @xmath20 the atmospheric neutrino mixing angle is given by @xmath21 and the so - called chooz angle by @xmath22 the scale of the loop - induced solar mass is given by @xmath23 and the solar mixing angle by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the tree level neutrino mixing matrix @xcite . in the region where the condition @xmath26 is fulfilled",
    "one finds that @xmath27 . for a more thorough discussion",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this model",
    "the neutrino spectrum is hierarchical and hence the neutrino mass scales coincide with the ( square roots of ) the mass squared differences measured in oscillation experiments .",
    "this implies that the r - parity violating parameters are significantly smaller than the r - parity conserving parameters : @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "this feature allows for the possibility that all r - parity violating couplings can be expanded in terms of the ratios @xmath30 several examples of this kind can be found in @xcite . we have used this possibility for a systematic expansion of the r - parity violating couplings to obtain a semi - analytical understanding of the results presented in the following section . for completeness",
    "we want to note that in our model also gauginos and gauge bosons have r - parity violating couplings implying that one can clearly distinguish brpv from a model where only trilinear r - parity violating couplings are present .",
    "in this section we present various collider observables and their correlations with neutrino observables for the following lsp candidates : charginos , sneutrinos , squarks and gluino .",
    "the numerical results are obtained in the following way except if stated otherwise : ( i ) we create a random sample over the susy parameter space , using five free parameters : @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "motivated by msugra , we calculate the gaugino masses approximately from @xmath7 , for the sfermion mass parameters we use @xmath6 directly at the electroweak scale .",
    "we have checked explicitly for several lsp sets that the latter simplification has no impact on our results .",
    "we then violate one of the following msugra conditions at a time .",
    "each condition is necessary but not sufficient to obtain the corresponding lsp , i.e. after calculating the susy spectrum we post - select points which have the desired candidate lsp .",
    "chargino lsps are obtained by the condition @xmath33 , sneutrino lsps by @xmath34 , squark lsps by @xmath35 and gluino lsps by @xmath36 .",
    "( ii ) the r - parity violating parameters are added such , that @xmath37 and @xmath38 are consistent with the experimental data .",
    "we want to stress that the correlations between low - energy and high - energy observables shown in the following are predictions after a generous sampling over the susy parameter space .",
    "much tighter correlations could be obtained , once information on at least a part of the susy spectrum is put in , see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of neutralinos .",
    "in particular information on @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 would be important in this respect .      for chargino lsps possible final states are @xmath44 where @xmath45 and we sum over the three neutrino flavours as well as the lighter quark states @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 which can not be separated experimentally .",
    "note , that we calculate here the 3-body decays even if an intermediate real 2-body final state is possible by including the finite width of the intermediate states .",
    "these intermediate states contain in general a gauge boson , whose r - parity violating couplings to charginos are typically an order of magnitude smaller compared to the r - parity violating couplings of the virtual sfermions .",
    "numerically one finds that the final state @xmath49 has usually the largest branching ratio ( up to 65 % ) .",
    "typical branching ratios for other final states not containing a top quark are in the range of several per mille to a few per  cent . final states with top quarks are found to be always very small or kinematically closed , because @xmath50 does not exceed 300 gev in our numerical data sets .",
    "moreover , the intermediate states are always off - shell in this case contrary to final states involving light quarks .    as a first example",

    "<S> supersymmetry with broken r - parity can explain the neutrino mass squared differences and mixing angles observed in neutrino oscillation experiments . in the minimal model , where r - parity is broken only by bilinear terms , certain decay properties of the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) </S>",
    "<S> are correlated with neutrino mixing angles . </S>",
    "<S> here we consider charginos , squarks , gluinos and sneutrinos being the lsp and calculate their decay properties in bilinear r - parity breaking supersymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> together with the decays of charged scalars and neutralinos calculated previously this completes the proof that bilinear r - parity breaking as the source of neutrino masses will be testable at future colliders . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we argue that in case of gmsb , the decays of the nlsp can be used to test the model .    </S>",
