    "being an experimentally accessible electronic system with the tunable parameters ,  @xcite granular superconductors , offer a unique testing ground for studying combined effects of disorder , coulomb interactions and superconducting fluctuations that govern the physics of disordered superconductors and are central to mesoscopic physics .",
    "one of the fundamental questions long calling for investigation is the problem of suppression of the superconducting critical temperature , @xmath5 , in granular superconductors and the role played in this suppression by the coulomb repulsion and superconducting fluctuations . in this paper",
    "we present a quantitative theory of the suppression of @xmath5 in granular samples .",
    "the customary belief was that - according to the anderson theorem  @xcite- disorder leaves critical temperature of a superconductor intact .",
    "however this result holds only in the mean field bcs approximation , and in all the cases where the extension beyond the bcs approximation is required , one can expect a noticeable suppression of the critical temperature .",
    "the main mechanisms of the superconductivity suppression are coulomb repulsion and superconducting fluctuations .",
    "for example , disorder shifts significantly the superconducting transition temperature in the @xmath6 thin films @xcite .",
    "the physical reason for the suppression of the critical temperature is that in thin films the interaction amplitude in the superconducting channel decreases due to peculiar disorder - induced interference effects which enhance the effective coulomb interaction . on the technical side , in order to evaluate the effect of disorder , one should sum a certain class of diagrams that include , in particular , cooperons and diffusons . in the subsequent discussion we will be referring to this mechanism of the superconductivity suppression as to the _ fermionic _ mechanism .",
    "the superconducting transition temperature can also be reduced by the fluctuations of the order parameter , the effect being especially strong in low dimensions .",
    "the corresponding mechanism of the superconductivity suppression is called the _",
    "bosonic _ mechanism .",
    "in particular , the bosonic mechanism can lead to the appearance of the insulating state at zero temperature .",
    "the physics of this state can be most easily understood in the case of a granular sample with weak intergranular coupling : the cooper pair can be localized on a single grain if the charging energy is larger than the josephson energy corresponding to the intergranular coupling  @xcite .",
    "later it was shown  @xcite , that a similar mechanism of cooper pair localization appears even in the case of the homogenously disordered films and the superconductor to insulator transition was predicted to occur at zero temperature .    in this paper",
    "we study the corrections to the superconducting transition temperature in granular metals perturbativelly . while this approach is restricted and can not be used for study of non - perturbative effects such as the superconductor to insulator transition , it is useful in a sense that both relevant mechanisms of the critical temperature suppression can be studied systematically within the same framework .",
    "the power of the perturbative calculation in the study of granular metals was demonstrated in that it revealed an important energy scale @xmath7 , which was missed for example by the effective phase functional formalism , where @xmath8 is the tunneling conductance between the grains and @xmath9 is the mean energy level spacing for a single grain , appearing in granular materials .",
    "the presence of this energy scale which has a simple physical interpretation of an inverse average time that an electron spends in a single grain before tunneling to one of the neighboring grains  @xcite , brings into play new behaviors that are absent in homogeneous media .",
    "in particular , the two _ different _ transport regimes at high , @xmath10 , and low , @xmath11 , temperatures appear .",
    "@xcite in the high temperature regime the correction to the conductivity due to the coulomb interaction depends logarithmically on temperature in all dimensions , while at low temperatures the interaction correction to conductivity has the altshuler - aronov form  @xcite and , thus is very sensitive to the dimensionality of the sample .    in a view of these findings",
    "one may expect that the correction to the superconducting transition temperature can also be different depending on whether the temperture is larger or smaller than the energy scale @xmath12 .    in the present paper",
    "we analyze the mechanisms of the suppression of superconductivity in both temperature regimes .",
    "we find that the fermionic mechanism is temperature dependent and that its contribution is strongly reduced in the region @xmath10 . in this regime",
    "the bosonic mechanism of the @xmath5 suppression becomes dominant . in the low temperature regime , @xmath13 ,",
    "the correction to the critical temperature is similar to that obtained for homogeneously disordered metals . in this regime",
    "the fermionic mechanism plays the major role as long as the intergranular tunneling conductance is large .",
