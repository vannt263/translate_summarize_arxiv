    "we can understand these optical to infrared differences in terms of the effect of the silicate cloud decks that exist in the photospheres of mid to late ",
    "type l dwarfs . for these objects ,",
    "the regions of the photosphere probed by the different indices are a strong function of wavelength ( see for example figure 7 of ackerman & marley 2001 ) .",
    "where the atmosphere is opaque , e.g. in the far  red and @xmath8 bands , the flux emerges from regions above the cloud decks which are less sensitive to the cloud optical depth .",
    "however the clear @xmath9 and @xmath10 regions are very sensitive to the clouds .",
    "hence the 12  @xmath5 m infrared indices may be more indicative of cloud optical depth than @xmath0 .",
    "also , we would expect the difference between optical and infrared type to be a function of color , as the redder , dustier , dwarfs will suffer more veiling and hence the infrared type will be earlier than the optical type .",
    "such a trend is seen in figure 1 ( excluding the extremely red l dwarf 2mass2244 + 20 for which the optical type also seems to be affected by the clouds ) .",
    "the more unusually blue or red l dwarfs also show a scatter between the infrared indices , as indicated by the error bars in figure 1 ( see discussion in knapp et al .",
    "the optical kirkpatrick scheme terminates at l8 whereas the infrared geballe scheme requires an l9 type .",
    "of six infrared l9t0 types with both optical and infrared classifications , four are optical l8s and two are l5s ; one of the latter is very blue in the infrared and would be expected to have a very early l optical type .",

    "there is little flux in the optical for the t dwarfs , making classification at these wavelengths difficult , and very few early t dwarfs have good signal to noise optical spectra , making standardisation less accurate .",

    "we explore the response of our synthetic spectra to gravity and metallicity changes in the two characteristic regimes of dusty and dust free atmospheres , i.e. in the m to l type dwarf regime , and in the t dwarf regime .",
    "we avoid the intermediate regime at @xmath0 between 1700 and 1400  k , where partial cloud coverage and/or formation may prevail , which is discussed in  3 .    here",
    "we show plots demonstrating the effects of gravity ( log  @xmath3 ) and metallicity ( [ @xmath2 ) .",
    "we use new extensions of the dusty models grid to a wide range of metallicity , and also a new grid of dust  free models where the grain opacities have not only been neglected ( cond  style models ) , but where the chemical equilibrium has been systematically depleted of all grains ( rainout models ) .",
    "these models also include new detailed line profiles for the na  i d and k  i doublets at 0.59 and 0.77 @xmath5 m ( allard et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the models indicate that an increase in gravity produces similar spectral changes to a decrease in metallicity , since both these changes increase the gas pressure in the atmosphere .",
    "however , the presence of dust grains in the atmospheres of late m to l dwarfs , which responds strongly to a decrease in metallicity , reverses the behavior of optical to red spectral features allowing the effects to be separated .",
    "this is not the case for the dust ",
    "free t dwarfs which behave much more like m subdwarfs .",

    "but some things help  even if metallicity and gravity produce the same effect , the size of the effect can be very different .",
    "note also that if metallicity is reduced it affects the double  metal features ( e.g. tio , vo ) more than the single  metal features ( e.g. k  i , h@xmath6o).@xmath13 : we should ensure that any label for gravity , e.g. @xmath27 , provides sufficient range to cover all expected gravities.@xmath14 : this is true .",

    "we also need to obtain a large enough sample to find the outliers with extreme metallicity and/or gravity .",
    "one way to do this is through proper motion surveys which can identify the older , likely metal  poor dwarfs .",
    "in the photosphere of ultracool dwarfs , we assume that dust forms at the condensation temperature @xmath29 but soon segregates at slightly lower temperature which we referred to as the critical temperature @xmath30 . as a result",
    ", a dust cloud forms in the region where @xmath31 , and this model is also referred to as the unified cloudy model ( ucm , tsuji 2002 ) .",
    "since @xmath32k for iron grains , for example , the dust cloud forms in the optically thin region of l dwarfs whose @xmath0 s are relatively high , but in the optically thick region of t dwarfs whose @xmath0 s are relatively low . as a result , it looks as if a homogeneous cloud formed in the upper photospheric layer in l dwarfs sinks to the deeper layer in t dwarfs .",
    "as long as the homogeneous cloud is in the upper photosphere as in l dwarfs , it will directly effect the observables and explains why l dwarfs appear to be dusty . in t dwarfs ,",
    "the effect of dust on the observables diminishes as the dust cloud sinks to the deeper region and , to a first approximation , this immersion of the homogeneous cloud explains the transition from l to t. note , however , that no specific mechanism is assumed for the sinking of the homogeneous cloud , this is simply a natural consequence of the change of the thermal structure as l dwarfs evolve to t dwarfs .",
    "this is clearly shown in figure 9 where @xmath33 ( knapp et al . 2004 ) is plotted against @xmath0 based on the bolometric flux ( leggett et al .",
    "2002 , golimowski et al .",
    "2004 , vrba et al .",
    "2004 ) , with different symbols for l and t dwarfs .",
    "the predicted values of @xmath33 for several values of @xmath30 are overlaid . the lower value of @xmath30 implies that the homogeneous cloud is thicker and @xmath33 will be redder because of the increased dust extinction .",
    "the scatter of the observed @xmath33 at any @xmath0 is rather large and this means that @xmath30 is variable at a fixed @xmath0 .",
    "after all , both @xmath0 and @xmath30 change in the transition from l to t across the `` l  t transition line '' indicated by the thick line in figure 9 .    in figure 10 , the observed @xmath34 ( mko system , knapp et al .",
    "2004 ) is compared with the predicted values for several values of @xmath30 at the fixed value of log@xmath3 = 5.0 .",
    "the cases of log@xmath3 = 4.5 and 5.5 are shown by the dotted and dashed lines , respectively , at the fixed value of @xmath35k .",
    "inspection of figure 10 reveals that the spread of the observed data in l and early t dwarfs is explained by the continuous change of @xmath30 from @xmath29 to @xmath36 ( surface temperature ) while that in late t dwarfs by the effect of log@xmath3 .",
    "thus , observed two ",
    "color diagrams can be explained with the three parameters , @xmath0 , log@xmath3 , and @xmath30 , but can not with the two parameters , @xmath0 and log@xmath3 alone .",
    "characteristic features of the observed @xmath37 color  magnitude ( cm ) diagram ( dahn et al .",
    "2002 , tinney , burgasser & kirkpatrick 2003 , vrba et al .",
    "2004 ) shown in figure 11 are rapid bluing and brightening at the transition from l to t. we transform the theoretical ( @xmath38 ) diagrams for initial masses of 10 and 70@xmath39 ( burrows et al .",
    "1997 ) to the @xmath37 diagram via ucms with @xmath40 , 1900 , 1800 , and 1700k , instead of the previous attempt assuming a uniform value of @xmath35k throughout ( tsuji & nakajima 2003 ) , and the results are overlaid on figure 11 .",
    "it is found that almost all the observed data can be reproduced with our predictions , and the bluing and brightening of the early t dwarfs can be explained by the models of @xmath41 ( i.e. effectively no cloud ) if not by the very low  mass models .",
    "thus the l ",
    "t transition on the cm diagram can be explained with the sinking homogeneous cloud model , but only if a sporadic variation of @xmath30 , which is a measure of the thickness of the cloud ( or dust column density ) in the observable photosphere , is assumed .",
    "such a variation of @xmath30 is not predicted by the present theory of structure and evolution of substellar objects , but we had to introduce @xmath30 as a free parameter to interpret purely empirical data such as the two  color diagram and cm diagram .",
    "the change of the spectra at the transition from l to t could have been interpreted as due to the change of @xmath0 on the assumption of @xmath35k throughout ( tsuji , nakajima & yanagisawa 2004 ) .",
    "for example , the typical l dwarf 2mass1523 showing red colors and weak or no ch@xmath42 bands could be consistent with @xmath43k , while the early t dwarf sdss1254 showing strong h@xmath44o and modest ch@xmath42 bands with @xmath45k ( figure 12 ) . however ,",
    "infrared colors suggest that @xmath30 can not be the same throughout l  t dwarfs ( figure 9 ) and also empirical values of @xmath0 show a plateau at @xmath46k between l8 and t4 ( golimowski et al .",
    "2004 , vrba et al .",
    "for this reason , we examine if the same spectra at the l ",
    "t transition can be explained with @xmath47k throughout but with changing @xmath30 .",
    "the l8 dwarf 2mass1523 can be explained with @xmath48k while the t2 dwarf sdss1254 with @xmath49k ( figure 13 ) .",
    "thus , different combinations of @xmath0 and @xmath30 could explain the change of spectra at the transition from l to t. this is because the dust column density in the observable photosphere depends not only on @xmath0 but also on @xmath30 .    how can we decide which case is correct ?",
    "for this purpose , assume first the empirical @xmath0 based on the bolometric flux , and @xmath30 can be estimated based on the infrared colors ( figure 9 ) . also , transform the observed spectrum to the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) on an absolute scale with the use of the observed parallax .",
    "then , analyze the sed to improve @xmath0 , @xmath30 , log@xmath3 , chemical composition , @xmath50 , etc . such an analysis applied to a sequence of l ",
    "t dwarfs including 2mass1711 ( l6.5 ) , 2mass1523 ( l8 ) , sdss1254 ( t2 ) , and sdss1750 ( t3.5 ) , which could have been interpreted as a sequence of @xmath0 from 1800 to 1100k with the uniform value of @xmath51k ( tsuji , nakajima & yanagisawa 2004 ) , revealed that @xmath52k throughout but @xmath30 should change from 1700k to @xmath29 ( tsuji , these proceedings ) .",
    "it is surprising that the distinct changes of the spectra from l6.5 to t3.5 , including the l ",
    "t transition , are nothing to do with @xmath0 but are instead due to the change of the dust column density at fixed @xmath0 .",
    "this result that the l  t spectral sequence is not a temperature sequence is based on a limited sample , but the same conclusion can be suggested by the curious brightening of @xmath53 when plotted against the l ",
    "t types .",
    "the transition from l to t takes place at @xmath54k ( figures 2 , 9 ) , and this transition can be understood as a consequence of a homogeneous cloud effectively sinking from optically thin to thick regions at about this @xmath0 . however , the l ",
    "t transition appears to be a somewhat more complicated phenomenon in that @xmath30 also changes ( figure 9 ) and this is even more directly related to the l ",
    "t spectral types around the transition .",
    "in other words , the thickness of the homogeneous cloud appears to decrease and even disappear at the transition from l to t. however , the mechanism of how @xmath30 changes at @xmath47k is unknown .",
    "the only known change of the photospheric structure is the formation of the second ( surface ) convective zone at @xmath47k in the ucms ( tsuji 2002 ) .",

    "shows that while cloudy models fit the l dwarfs , by spectral type t5 models with no cloud opacity ( but with condensation included in the equilibrium chemistry ) fit spectra very well , implying that condensates play a very small role in controlling the thermal profile and emitted flux of mid to late  t dwarfs .",
    "any explanation of the l to t transition mechanism must be consistent with the evidence summarized above .",
    "the unmistakable gross explanation  that condensates have been lost from the atmosphere  belies the difficulty in explaining this loss in a self  consistent manner . that a sinking , finite  thickness cloud deck will eventually disappear from sight allowing the atmosphere above to cool has been apparent for some time ( allard et al 2001 , marley 2000 , tsuji & nakjima 2003 ) . the difficulty lies in explaining the rapidity of the color change in light of the measured effective temperatures ( figures 9 and 14 ) .",

( 2002 ) , following a suggestion from ackerman & marley ( 2001 ) , hypothesized that the transition was associated with the appearance of holes in the global cloud deck . the holes , hypothesized to be similar to jupiter s well known `` 5-micron hot spots '' , would allow flux to emerge through the @xmath9 and @xmath10band atmospheric opacity windows . if the onset of the holes corresponded with the @xmath0 of the l / t transition region , then their appearance could account for the characteristics of the transition outlined above .",
    "indeed burgasser et al . demonstrated with a simple model that holes could plausibly account for the bluing in @xmath33 and brightening in @xmath10 .",
    "figure 14 , similar to figure 9 , demonstrates that , for fixed gravity , rapidly moving from a cloudy to a cloud  free model apparently accounts for the available data .",
    "this mechanism would also account for the reappearance of feh absorption since hot , feh  bearing gas would be detectable through the clouds , if the holes pierced both the global silicate and underlying fe cloud deck .    finally knapp et al .",
    "( 2004 ) suggested that , like a varying @xmath30 , a varying @xmath1 ( sedimentation efficiency , ackerman & marley 2001 ) could result in a sudden downpour that might rapidly remove the cloud deck over a small effective temperature range .",
    "regardless of whether the l to t transition is explained by the appearance of holes in the global cloud deck or a sudden increase in the efficiency of condensate sedimentation , the root cause must lie with the atmospheric dynamics .",
    "perhaps the behavior of condensates change when the cloud reaches a certain depth in the atmospheric convection zone .",
    "when even the cloud tops are firmly rooted in the convection zone the clouds may be sheared apart by height  varying zonal flow , like that found in jupiter . perhaps the second , detached convection zone found in brown dwarf atmosphere models plays a role .",
    "another possibility is that there is a change in the global atmospheric circulation that affects the cloud decks .",
    "schubert & zhang ( 2000 ) found that brown dwarfs likely exhibit one of two styles of global atmospheric circulation .",
    "they may either exhibit circulation strongly influenced by rotation , like jupiter , or fairly independent of rotation , like the sun .",
    "perhaps the l to t transition is associated with a transition between the two circulation regimes encountered as a brown dwarf cools .",
    "the solution of this enigma certainly lies in understanding the three dimensional interplay of global atmospheric circulation with both macro and micro  scale cloud dynamics .",
    "@xmath13 : we need to see the l to t transition in clusters to reduce the age spread in the color : magnitude diagram.@xmath14 : work done on the @xmath16 ori cluster is probing into the t regime and may show the blueward turn in the diagrams .",
    "@xmath13 : the change in spectral type at constant effective temperature is a real and observed efect ; it is not artificial .",
    "@xmath14 : its artifical only in the sense that it is due to changing cloud parameters and not changing @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath13 : is it ok to have spectral type @xmath62 depend on @xmath0?@xmath14 : in the spirit of the spectral type being an observable , yes it is .",
    "the spectra definitely change.@xmath13 : is there a correlation between @xmath30 and @xmath1?@xmath14 : no because there are differences between the two models such as particle size .",
    "note that no set of parameters for particle size can explain the l to t transition.@xmath13 : surely microphysical effects should be included?@xmath14 : this is very complex and we try to mimic the effects through the @xmath30 and @xmath1 parameters .",
    "[ discussion of the microphysics is presented by hellings elsewhere.]@xmath13 : is the mixing length approximation to convection valid?@xmath14 : it is acceptable to first order for l and t dwarfs .",
    "the plane parallel assumption is ok too.@xmath13 : for jupiter we see that the holes are significant flux contributers.@xmath14 : the l and t dwarfs are being monitored for variability .",
    "interpreting the results depends however on both hole size and number .",
    "the concepts and nomenclature of stellar classification were refined in the late 19th century primarily through the works of secchi , fleming and pickering .",
    "the sequence of letters used today comes from the work of canon & pickering ( 1901 ) who produced the obafgkm empirical sequence based on differences between photographic spectra .",
    "this sequence has been embellished with further spectral types , e.g. c to denote carbon stars ( morgan , keenan & kellman 1941 ) , but served as a complete temperature sequence for nearly a hundred years .",
    "then in the 1990s intrinsically faint very cool objects started to be discovered ( e.g. gj 229b by nakajima et al .",
    "the spectra of objects such as gj 229b ( e.g. oppenheimer et al .",
    "1995 and figure 15 ) showed unprecedented methane  rich spectra",
    ". such spectra along with the burgeoning numbers of m dwarfs with spectral types beyond m9 ( kirkpatrick et al .",
    "1998 ) gave rise to the necessity for further spectral types .",
    "the letter l results from a proposal by martn et al .",
    "( 1997 ) that l should denote low temperature and there might be low temperature lithium and methane designations .",
    "the l spectral type and also the t spectral type became generally accepted in the literature following a seminal paper by kirkpatrick et al .",

    "it is thus important to consider further spectral types .    notwithstanding the non  alphabetical order of the hot spectral types",
    ", it seems desirable to continue the sequence alphabetically when suggesting further , cooler , types .",
    "thus a letter from t to z would be preferred , though perhaps not z itself as this suggests the end of the spectral typing sequence .",
    "there are three major factors to consider in choosing a new spectral type : ( 1 ) it must be unambiguous and should not currently be used to represent any other spectral type , ( 2 ) the letter must represent a typing that is clearly distinguished from other types of astronomical objects , ( 3 ) the letter should be free of physical interpretation ( which is likely to vary with time ) . as discussed by kirkpatrick",
    "( 1999 ) , u and x are problematic choices because of possible associations with ultraviolet and xray sources .",
    "v would be a good choice but for the possible confusion with vanadium oxide ( vo ) which shows prominent bands in spectra of late ",
    "type m and early  type l dwarfs .",
    "w is undesirable because of likely confusion with wolf - rayet wn and wr classes .",
    "y could be confused with yttrium oxide ( yo ) which may also appear in cool dwarf spectra , however , it has yet to be identified and the low abundance of yo means that it may not be evident . assuming that yo is not found",
    ", y seems the best choice for the next spectral class . while the choice of y may seem uncomfortably close to the end of the alphabet it is important to note that the broad spectral features of t dwarfs are somewhat similar to the solar system planets titan and jupiter .",
    "although the infrared spectra of solar system objects are in reflected sunlight , their spectra are dominated by methane and water vapour absorption features in a similar manner to t dwarfs , e.g. figure [ jones_geballe ] . in fact , given the relatively low masses and temperatures of titan and jupiter it is perhaps desirable that the classification system is reaching an alphabetic end point .",
    "the dominance of methane in the infrared spectra of t dwarfs means they are often called methane dwarfs . while methane is the defining characteristic of t dwarfs it can also be seen at 3.3 @xmath5 m in l spectral types later than l4 ( noll et al .",
    "recently obtained mid  infrared spectra ( roellig et al . 2004 ) show that ammonia can be seen at 11  @xmath5 m in t dwarfs later than t5 .",
    "figure [ jones_burrows ] from burrows , sudarsky & lunine ( 2003 ) indicates that ammonia will become dominant in both the near and mid  infrared at temperatures below 700  k. it is likely that , in the same manner that t dwarfs are known as methane dwarfs , the next spectral type will be known as ammonia dwarfs .    figure [ jones_pinfield ] shows a colour  colour plot with model predictions for y dwarfs , prepared to aid selecting such objects in the uk infrared telescope s ( ukirt ) wide field camera ( wfcam ) large area survey ( las ) .",
    "although the model groups predict somewhat different colors , we can identify candidate y dwarfs as red in @xmath63 and blue in @xmath64 ( see also the wfcam contribution by leggett in these procedings ) .",
    "a detailed understanding of y dwarf properties ( and ultimately the brown dwarf mass function ) will require spectroscopic analyses to simultaneously determine effective temperature , metallicity and gravity , as we are now attempting for l and t dwarfs ."
