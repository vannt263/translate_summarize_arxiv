    "despite its still limited extent , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) continues to be a remarkable resource for studies of galactic structure .",
    "in addition to the large scale features attributed to past galaxy accretion events @xcite , sdss data were used to detect the remarkably strong tidal tails of palomar 5 @xcite .",
    "tidal tails of globular clusters are particularly interesting from a galactic structure standpoint as they are expected to be very numerous and to sample the galactic potential much more uniformly than satellite galaxies .",
    "moreover , such tidal tails are dynamically very cold @xcite , making them useful for constraining not only the global galactic potential , but also its lumpiness @xcite .",
    "substantial tidal streams have now been found associated with at least two of the eight globular clusters in the sdss area ; pal 5 @xcite and ngc 5466 @xcite . in this letter",
    "we examine a much larger region of the sdss to search for more extended structures .",
    "we briefly describe our analysis in section [ analysis ] .",
    "we discuss the detection of a new stellar stream in section [ discussion ] , make some initial distance estimates in section [ distance ] , attempt to identify a progenitor in section [ progenitor ] , and put initial constraints on the orbit in section [ orbit ] .",
    "we make concluding remarks section [ conclusions ] .",
    "data comprising @xmath1 , and @xmath2 photometry for @xmath3 stars in the region @xmath4 and @xmath5 were extracted from the sdss database using the sdss casjobs query system .",
    "the data were analyzed using the matched filter technique employed by @xcite and @xcite , and described in detail by @xcite .",
    "this technique is made necessary by the fact that , over the magnitude range and over the region of sky we are considering , the foreground disk stars outnumber the more distant stars in the galactic halo by three orders of magnitude .",
    "applied to the color - magnitude domain , the matched filter is a means by which we can optimally differentiate between two populations , provided we know the color - magnitude distribution of each .    in practise , we use the sdss photometry to create a color - magnitude density or hess diagram for both the stars of interest ( e.g. those in a globular cluster ) and the foreground population . dividing the former by the latter ,",
    "we generate an array of relative weights that constitute an optimal color - magnitude filter . using this filter ,",
    "every star in the survey can be assigned a weight or probability of being a member of our chosen globular cluster based on its measured magnitude and color .",
    "having used observed data to generate it , the filter implicitly includes the effects of photometric uncertainties , and even though a particular star may lie 3@xmath6 away from the main sequence of a globular cluster of interest , its relative weight ( and thus probability of being a cluster star ) may still be high if the number of foreground stars in this region of the hess diagram is relatively low ( e.g. near the horizontal branch , or blueward of the main sequence turnoff ) .    as we were initially interested in searching for tidal streams associated with globular clusters , we constructed hess diagrams for each of the eight globular clusters in the sdss dr4 area ( ngc 2419 , pal 3 , ngc 5272 , ngc 5466 , pal 5 , ngc 6205 , ngc 7078 , and ngc 7089 ) .",
    "a single hess diagram for field stars was generated using @xmath7 stars spread over @xmath8 deg@xmath9 of dr4 .",
    "we then applied each of the eight resulting optimal filters in turn to the entire survey area .",
    "the resulting weighted star counts were summed by location on the sky to produce eight different , two dimensional weight images or probability maps .",
    "we used all stars with @xmath10 .",
    "we dereddended the sdss photometry as a function of position on the sky using the dirbe / iras dust maps of @xcite .",
    "we optimally filtered the @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 star counts independently and then co - added the resulting weight images . in figure 1",
    "we show the final , combined , filtered star count distribution , using a filter matched to the color magnitude distribution of stars in ngc 6205 ( m 13 ) .",
    "the image has been smoothed with a gaussian kernel with @xmath15 . a low - order",
    ", polynomial surface has been subtracted from the image to approximately remove large scale gradients due to the galactic disk and bulge .",
    "quite obvious in figure 1 is a long , remarkably smooth , curving stream of stars , extending over @xmath16 . on the sky the stream runs in an almost straight line through the whole of ursa major and leo minor , ending in cancer and spanning a total of @xmath17 .",
    "the stream is most evident when we use a filter that is matched to the color - magnitude distribution and luminosity function of stars in m 13 , although shifted faintwards by 0.2 mag .",
    "optimal filters based on the other seven globular clusters in dr4 did not yield the level of contrast that we see in figure 1 .",
    "the stream is easily visible in each individual color pair , including @xmath18 .",
    "there may be a second , more diffuse feature with @xmath19 about @xmath20 to the north of the stream , but we defer analysis of this feature to a future paper .",
    "the stream is not a product of our dereddening procedure ; careful examination of the reddening map of @xcite shows no correlation between this feature and the applied reddening corrections .",
    "the maximum values of @xmath21 are @xmath22 , with typical values in the range 0.01 - 0.02 over the length of the stream . rerunning",
    "the matched filter analysis without reddening corrections yielded little more than a slight reduction in the apparent strength of the stream .",
    "we also ran our optimum filter against the sdss dr4 galaxy catalog to investigate whether the stream could be due to confusion with faint galaxies .",
    "( such a structure in the distribution of galaxies would be no less interesting than a stellar stream of these dimensions ! ) .",
    "however , we found no feature in the filtered galaxy counts that could mimic the stream apparent in figure 1 .    at its southwestern end",
    "the stream is truncated by the limits of the available data .",
    "we attempted to trace the stream in the portion of dr4 with @xmath23 but could find no convincing continuation .",
    "plausible orbits for the stream ( see below ) predict a fairly narrow range of possible paths across this region , and generally a rather sharp increase in sun - stream distance .",
    "we attempted to recover the stream by shifting our filter from -1.0 to + 3.0 mags , but to no avail .",
    "a continuation of the stream may well be there , but the power of the matched filter is significantly reduced as the bulk of the main sequence drops below the survey data s 50% completeness threshold . combined with the rapid rise in the number of contaminating galactic disk stars in this region , there appears to be little chance of recovering the stream until much deeper surveys become available .    on the northeastern end ,",
    "the stream becomes indiscernible beyond ra = @xmath24 .",
    "we attempted to enhance the northeastern end of the stream by shifting the filter to both brighter and fainter magnitudes , but again to no avail .",
    "experiments in which we inserted artificial stellar streams with surface densities similar to those observed in figure 1 revealed that they too largely vanished beyond r.a .",
    "= @xmath24 . hence , while it is conceivable that we are seeing the physical end of the stream , it is equally possible that our failure to trace the stream any further reflects once again the rapidly increasing contamination by field stars at lower galactic latitudes .",
    "sampling at several representative points , the stream appears to be @xmath25 wide ( fwhm ) on average .",
    "this width is similar to those observed in the tidal tails of the globular clusters pal 5 and ngc 5466 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the width is much narrower than the tidal arms of the sagittarius dwarf @xcite ( one of which runs along the southern edge of the field shown in figure 1 ) .",
    "this suggests that the stars making up the stream have a low random velocities , and that they were probably weakly stripped from a relatively small potential . combining this with a location high above the galactic plane ( see below )",
    "suggests that the parent body is or was a globular cluster .    integrating the background subtracted , weighted star counts over a width of @xmath26 we find the total number of stars in the discernible stream to be @xmath27 .",
    "as is evident in figure 1 , the surface density of stars fluctuates considerably along the stream . for stars with @xmath28",
    "the average surface density is @xmath29 stars deg@xmath30 , with occasional peaks of over 70 stars deg@xmath30 .",
    "the power of the matched filter resides primarily at the main sequence turnoff and below , where the luminosity function increases rapidly and the stars lie blueward of the bulk of foreground population .",
    "the blue horizontal branch can generate much higher weights per star , but the typical numbers of horizontal branch stars in any likely progenitor are too low to account for such a continuous and well - populated stream ( e.g. @xcite ) . assuming that our filter is indeed beating against the main sequence of the stream population , we can use the filter response to estimate distances .",
    "we have attempted to extract the color magnitude distribution for the stream stars directly , but contamination by foreground stars is so high as to make differentiation between stream and field distributions highly uncertain .",
    "varying the shift applied to the m 13 matched filter from -0.3 to + 0.7 mags , we measured the background - subtracted , mean weighted star counts along the stream in the regions @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .",
    "we also measured a @xmath34 segment centered on the strongest concentration of stream stars at ( r.a , decl . ) = ( 144.1 , 30.3 ) . to avoid potential problems related to a difference in age between m 13 and the stream stars",
    ", we used only the portion of the filter with @xmath35 , where the bright cutoff is 0.8 mags below m 13 s main sequence turn off .",
    "this reduces the contrast between the stream and the background by about 40% , but still provides sufficient signal strength to enable a reasonably precise measurement of peak response .",
    "if our assumptions above are valid , we are effectively measuring relative distances by main sequence fitting .",
    "the mean stream surface densities as a function of filter magnitude shift are shown in figure 2 . using a distance to m 13 of 7.7 kpc and fitting gaussians to the individual profiles",
    ", we find sun - stream distances of 7.3 , 8.5 , and 9.1 kpc , respectively , for the three stream segments identified above . the high density clump at r.a .",
    "@xmath36 yields a distance of 7.7 kpc .",
    "this puts the mean distance of the stream high above the galactic disk at @xmath37 kpc , with the stream oriented almost perpendicularly to our line of sight .",
    "the corresponding galactocentric distances range from 13.5 to 15 kpc .",
    "the measured distances rise more or less monotonically from southwest to northeast , as might be expected for a feature that traces a small part of an extended galactic orbit . based on the widths of the peaks in figure 2 we estimate our random measurement uncertainties to be @xmath38 pc .    while the match between the color - magnitude distributions of stars in m 13 and those in the stream",
    "is uncertain , the relative line - of - sight distances along the stream should be fairly robust .",
    "the measurement of relative distances rests only on the assumption that the color - magnitude distribution of stream stars is uniform , and that different parts of the stream will respond to filter shifts in the same way . of course",
    ", this may not be valid if the luminosity function of stars escaping from the parent cluster changed as a function of time due to the dynamical evolution of the cluster , and a forthcoming paper will deal with possible observational support for this .",
    "our relative distance estimates may also be subject to variations in sdss sensitivity and completeness at faint magnitudes , although it seems reasonable to suppose that such variations will have largely averaged out on the scales with which we are dealing .",
    "the location and the narrowness of the stream lead us to believe that the progenitor likely is or was a globular cluster .",
    "on the other hand , the stream does not pass near any of the eight globular clusters in dr4 .",
    "in particular , despite the apparent similarity in color magnitude distribution , there appears to be no way to dynamically associate the stream with m 13 .",
    "the distance , radial velocity , and proper motion measurements for m 13 are among the best for any globular cluster @xcite . using these measurements",
    ", the projected orbital path of m 13 is neither near nor aligned with the stream for either the last two or the next two orbits of the cluster .",
    "we conclude that there is almost no possibility that m 13 could be the progenitor of the current stream .",
    "could it be that the stream might be an apogalactic concentration of tidally stripped stars from a globular cluster that is currently elsewhere in its orbit ?",
    "we have integrated orbits for 39 globular clusters with measured proper motions @xcite to see whether their orbits are aligned with the stream at its current location .",
    "this is fraught with considerable uncertainty as even small errors in the proper motions measurements can lead to rather large departures between the predicted and true orbits of clusters . nonetheless , as a first attempt to associate this stream with a progenitor , we integrated orbits for the 39 clusters , projected them onto the sky , and compared them with the location and orientation of the stream .",
    "we used the galactic model of @xcite , which includes a disk and bulge and assumes a spherical halo .",
    "only two of the 39 clusters , ngc 1904 and ngc 4590 , have predicted orbits whose projections lie near the stream on the sky and are roughly aligned with it . both of these clusters show evidence of tidal tails @xcite .",
    "however , for ngc 1904 the orbital path in the region of the stream passes within 5 kpc of the sun .",
    "this would require a brightward shift of the m 13 filter of over a magnitude , a shift that we have tested and for which the stream all but disappears . for ngc 4590",
    ", the apparent alignment with the stream is much closer , but the predicted distances at the eastern and western ends of the stream are 8.2 and 19 kpc , respectively .",
    "thus , not only does the mean distance disagree with our estimate above , but the spatial orientation of the stream is at odds with the predicted orbit by more than @xmath39 .    where then is the progenitor of the stream ?",
    "it is certainly possible that the stream represents the leavings of one of the @xmath40 clusters for which we can not yet estimate orbits . alternatively",
    ", the source of the stream may be embedded in the stream itself .",
    "the densest portions of the stream occur at ( r.a .",
    ", decl . ) = ( @xmath41 ) and ( @xmath42 ) , each with surface densities of over 70 stars deg@xmath30 .",
    "however , 70 stars deg@xmath30 to almost 4 mags below the turn off would barely qualify as an open cluster .",
    "examining the distribution of sdss catalog stars directly , there appears to be no tendency for the stars to cluster in these regions .",
    "the highest density peaks in figure 1 are probably not bound clusters , and may rather be entirely analogous to similar peaks seen in the tidal stream of pal 5 , which are interpreted as a natural consequence of the episodic nature of tidal stripping .",
    "alternatively , one of the peaks in figure 1 could be the _ remnant _ of the parent cluster .",
    "the existence of such disrupted clusters would not be unexpected @xcite , and pal 5 itself is believed to have lost at least 90% of its mass and to be on its last orbit around the galaxy @xcite .",
    "lacking velocity measurements , we can not `` solve '' for the orbit of the stream .",
    "however , the apparent orientation of the stream , along with our estimates of its distance and curvature , can yield some constraints . again using the galactic model of @xcite (",
    "which @xcite and @xcite found to work reasonably well for ngc 5466 and pal 5 ) , we use a least squares method to fit both the orientation on the sky and the distance measurements in section [ distance ] .",
    "the tangential velocity at each point is primarily constrained by the projected path of the stream on the sky , while our distance estimates help to limit the range of possible radial velocities .",
    "we fit to a number of normal points lying along the centerline of the stream and adopt a radial velocity fiducial point at the midpoint of the northeastern segment above , with r.a .",
    ", dec = ( 202.0 , 58.4 ) .",
    "if we give no weight to our relative distance estimates but use only the @xmath43 kpc estimate for the fiducial point , then for a reasonable range of radial velocities ( @xmath44 km s@xmath45 km s@xmath46 ) , the perigalacticon of the stream s orbit must lie in the range 6.5 kpc @xmath47 kpc .",
    "for all lsr radial velocities in the range -270 km s@xmath48 km s@xmath46 , the apogalactic radius is constrained to fall within 17 kpc @xmath49 kpc . on the other hand , positive radial velocities",
    "lead to orbits with apogalactica rising from 100 to 500 kpc .",
    "all of these orbits give excellent fits to the observed path of the stream on the sky .",
    "if we constrain the model using our relative distance estimates ( allowing the proper motions to become free ranging and uninteresting parameters ) we find a best fit value for the radial velocity at the fiducial point of @xmath50 km s@xmath46 , where the uncertainty corresponds to the 95% confidence interval .",
    "the orbit corresponding to this radial velocity has @xmath51 kpc and @xmath52 kpc , where the uncertainties reflect only our estimated uncertainty in the radial velocity . for this orbit ,",
    "the physical length of the visible stream would be @xmath53 kpc .",
    "applying optimal contrast filtering techniques to sdss data , we have detected a stream of stars some @xmath0 long on the sky .",
    "we are unable to identify a progenitor for this stream , although from its appearance and location on the sky , we believe it to be a either an extant or disrupted globular cluster . based on a good match to the color - magnitude distribution of stars in m 13 , we conclude that the stars making up the stream are primarily old and metal poor , and that the stream as a whole is about 8.5 kpc distant and roughly perpendicular to our line of sight",
    ".    refinement of the stream s orbit will require radial velocity measurements of individual stars along its length .",
    "ultimately , the vetted stream stars will become prime targets for the _ space interferometry mission _ , whose proper motion measurements will enable very much stronger constraints to be placed on both the orbit of the progenitor and on the potential field of the galaxy .",
    "we are grateful to helio rocha - pinto for comments which significantly improved the manuscript .",
