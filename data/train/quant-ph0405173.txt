    "[ macroentanglement ] ) .",
    "although such superposition is trivially recognized for some states ( such as the ` cat ' state ) , it is hard to find such superposition by intuition for general states . in order to judge",
    "whether such superposition is hidden in a general state , we use an essentially unique index @xmath2 , defined by eq .",

    "it was shown by shimizu and miyadera @xcite ( hereafter refereed as sm ) that this index is directly related to fundamental stabilities of many - body states , i.e. , to fragility in noises or environments and to stability against local measurements .",
    "that is , a state with @xmath5 is not particularly unstable against noises in the sense that its decoherence rate does not exceed @xmath6 in any noises or environments , whereas the decoherence rate of a state with @xmath3 can become as large as @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a quantum state with @xmath3 is unstable against local measurements , whereas a homogeneous state with @xmath5 is stable .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional @xmath0-spin system with @xmath1 , and calculate the index @xmath2 for various pure states in which magnons are excited with various densities and wavenumbers .",
    "we find macroscopically entangled states ( @xmath3 ) as well as ` normal ' states with @xmath5 which _ are _ entangled but _ not _ macroscopically . according to sm",

    "the results also demonstrate that states with huge entanglement , as measured by either @xmath2 or @xmath7 , can be easily constructed by simply applying creation operators of magnons to a ferromagnetic state , which is a separable state .",
    "neither randomness nor elaborate tuning are necessary to construct states with huge entanglement from a separable state",

    "a magnon is an elementary excitation of magnetic materials .",
    "it is a quantum of a spin wave that is a collective motion of the order parameter , which is the magnetization @xmath13 for a ferromagnet .",
    "for example , consider a one - dimensional heisenberg ferromagnet which consists of @xmath0 spin-@xmath14 atoms . under the periodic boundary condition ,",
    "its hamiltonian is given by @xmath15 here , @xmath16 is a positive constant , and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 are pauli operators on site @xmath19 .",
    "we denote eigenvectors of @xmath20 corresponding to eigenvalues + 1 and -1 by @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "one of the ground states of the hamiltonian is @xmath23 , in which @xmath13 points to the @xmath24 direction .",
    "the state in which one magnon with wavenumber @xmath25 is excited on this ground state is @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "the excitation energy of @xmath28 is easily calculated as @xmath29 it goes to zero as @xmath30 because a magnon is a nambu - goldstone boson .",
    "the dispersion relation for small @xmath25 is nonlinear because a magnon is a non - relativistic excitation .",
    "because of the periodic boundary condition , @xmath25 takes discrete values in the first brillouin zone , @xmath31 ; @xmath32 it is conventional to define the ` creation operator ' of a magnon with wavenumber @xmath25 by @xmath33 the commutation relations are calculated as @xmath34 & = & \\left[\\hat{m}_k,\\hat{m}_{k'}\\right]= 0,\\\\ \\left[\\hat{m}_k,\\hat{m}_{k'}^{\\dagger}\\right ] & = & -\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{l=1}^ne^{i(k'-k)l}\\hat{\\sigma}_z(l ) .",

    "the deviations from these relations become significant when @xmath48 .    an @xmath35-magnon state with a small density ( @xmath49 ) of magnons",
    "is an approximate energy eigenstate .",
    "although an @xmath35-magnon state with a large number ( @xmath48 ) of magnons is not generally a good approximation to energy eigenstate , such a state is frequently used in discussions on a macroscopic order because many magnetic phase transitions can be regarded as condensation of @xmath6 magnons .",
    "for example , the state in which @xmath50 points to a direction with the direction vector @xmath51 can be described as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the @xmath35-magnon state with @xmath54 , and @xmath55 is the binomial coefficient ; @xmath56 when @xmath57 , @xmath55 has a peak at @xmath58 , and thus a macroscopic number of magnons are ` condensed ' .",

    "[ sec - stability ] .",
    "we are most interested in superposition of macroscopically distinct states , which has been attracting much attention for many years @xcite .",
    "we note that such superposition was defined rather ambiguously .",
    "for example , the ` disconnectivity ' defined in ref .",
    "@xcite is not invariant under changes of canonical variables , such as from the pairs of positions and momenta to the pair of a field and its canonical conjugate .",
    "furthermore , in much literature the energy scale is not specified to determine the degrees of freedom involved in the superposition",
    ". however , the degrees of freedom , hence the disconnectivity , usually grows ( decreases ) quickly with increasing ( decreasing ) the energy scale under consideration @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", sm proposed a new definition that is free from these ambiguities .",
    "we therefore follow sm .",
    "we first fix the energy range under consideration . for definiteness",
    "we assume that in that energy range the system can be regarded as @xmath0 spin-@xmath63 atoms , which are arranged on a one - dimensional lattice .",
    "we note that two states are ` macroscopically distinct ' iff some macroscopic variable(s ) takes distinct values for those states . as a macroscopic variable",
    ", it is natural to consider the sum or average of local observables over a macroscopic region @xcite .",
    "since the average can be directly obtained from the sum , we only consider the sum in the following .",
    "that is , we consider additive operators @xcite , which take the following form : @xmath64 .",
    "here , @xmath65 is a local operator on site @xmath19 , which , for the spin system under consideration , is a linear combination of the pauli operators @xmath66 and the identity operator @xmath67 on site @xmath19 . since we will consider all possible additive operators ,",
    "we do _ not _ assume that @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) is a spatial translation of @xmath65 .",
    "two states , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , are macroscopically distinct iff some additive observable(s ) @xmath72 takes ` macroscopically distinct values ' for those states in the sense that @xmath73 therefore , if a pure state @xmath74 has fluctuation of this order of magnitude , i.e. , if @xmath75^{1/2 } = o(n ) $ ] for some additive observable(s ) @xmath72 , where @xmath76 , then the state is a superposition of macroscopically distinct states .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath77 @xcite for every additive observable @xmath72 the state has ` macroscopically definite values ' for all additive observables .",
    "a typical magnitude of @xmath78 for such a state is @xmath79 @xcite . to express these ideas in a simple form ,",
    "we define an index @xmath2 for an arbitrary pure state @xmath80 by the asymptotic behavior ( for large @xmath0 ) of fluctuation of the additive observable that exhibits the largest fluctuation for that state @xcite : @xmath81 here , @xmath82 is the set of all additive operators . according to the above argument , @xmath80 is a superposition of macroscopically distinct states iff @xmath3 , and for pure states @xmath2 is the essentially unique index that characterizes such a superposition .",
    "we therefore say that a pure state is _ macroscopically entangled _",
    "iff @xmath3 .",
    "it is well - known that many entanglement measures which are defined as an extremum are intractable @xcite .",
    "in contrast , there is an efficient method of computing the index @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "we here explain the method briefly assuming an @xmath0 spin-@xmath14 system .",
    "any local operator @xmath83 on site @xmath19 can be expressed as a linear combination of @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "since the identity operator @xmath86 does not have fluctuation for any state , we can limit ourselves to local operators that are linear combinations of pauli operators .",
    "therefore , an additive observable in question generally takes the following form ; @xmath87 where @xmath88 s are complex coefficients ( see sec .",
    "[ hermitian ] ) .",
    "since the local operators should not depend on @xmath0 ( because otherwise @xmath89 would not become additive ) , @xmath88 s should not depend on @xmath0 , hence the sum @xmath90 is @xmath6 . since we are interested only in the power @xmath2 of @xmath91 , we can normalize @xmath88 without loss of generality as @xmath92 the fluctuation of @xmath89 for a given state @xmath80 is expressed as @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the hermitian matrix defined by @xmath95 which we call the _ variance - covariance matrix _ ( vcm ) for @xmath80 .",
    "it is seen from eq .",
    "( [ flucbyvcm ] ) that eigenvalues of this matrix are non - negative , and that @xmath96 takes the maximum value when @xmath88 is an eigenvector of the vcm corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue @xmath97 . by taking @xmath88 of eq .",
    "( [ flucbyvcm ] ) as such an eigenvector , we obtain @xmath98 therefore , @xmath97 is related to @xmath2 as @xmath99 for example , @xmath5 if @xmath100 whereas @xmath3 if @xmath101 .    note that we can evaluate @xmath2 of a given state using this method in a polynomial time of the number @xmath0 of spins , because we have only to calculate the maximum eigenvalue of a vcm , which is a @xmath102 matrix .",
    "the @xmath0-spin ghz state , or the ` cat ' state , @xmath103 violates a generalized bell s inequality by a macroscopic factor @xcite .",
    "the index @xmath2 correctly indicates that this state is macroscopically entangled , @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , @xmath7 ( which is defined by eq .  ( [ sn/2 ] ) below ) of this state is extremely small ; @xmath104 . it may be intuitively trivial that this state is macroscopically entangled . however , intuition is useless for more general states such as the following examples .",
    "the greatest advantage of using @xmath2 is that it correctly judges the presence or absence of macroscopic entanglement for any complicated pure states .",
    "for example , it was recently shown @xcite that the quantum state of many qubits in a quantum computer performing shor s factoring algorithm is transformed in such a way that @xmath2 is increased as the computation proceeds , and the state just after the modular exponentiation processes , @xmath105 is a macroscopically entangled state . here , @xmath106",
    "( @xmath107 ) represents a state of the first ( second ) register , @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) denotes the number of qubits in the first register , @xmath110 is a randomly taken integer , and @xmath111 is a large integer to be factored .",
    "this state was shown to play an essential role in shor s factoring algorithm @xcite .",
    "although _ presence _ of entanglement in this state is obvious , the presence of _ macroscopic _ entanglement was not revealed until an additive operator whose fluctuation is @xmath10 was found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another example is entanglement of ground states of antiferromagnets , which has recently been studied by many authors using various measures @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that the _ exact _ ground state @xmath112 of the heisenberg antiferromagnet on a two - dimensional square lattice of a finite size is _ not _ the nel state but the _ symmetric _ state that possesses all the symmetries of the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "we here point out that @xmath112 is entangled macroscopically , @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , the ground state has a long - range order @xcite , @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the staggered magnetization @xmath115 . on the other hand , @xmath116 by symmetry .",
    "therefore , the order parameter @xmath117 of the antiferromagnetic phase transition exhibits a huge fluctuation , @xmath118 this shows that @xmath3 for @xmath112 .",
    "note that such a macroscopically entangled ground state appears generally in a _ finite _ system that will exhibit a phase transition as @xmath119 if the order parameter does not commute with the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "for example , the ground state of interacting bosons @xcite , for which the order parameter is the field operator of the bosons , is entangled macroscopically . moreover , the ground state of the transverse ising model , whose entanglement has recently been studied using various measures @xcite , also has @xmath3 when the transverse magnetic field is below the critical point .    as demonstrated by these examples ,",
    "the index @xmath2 captures the presence or absence of certain anomalous features , which are sometimes hard to find intuitively , of pure quantum states in finite macroscopic systems .",
    "furthermore , as we will explain in sec .  [ sec - stability ] , @xmath2 is directly related to fundamental stabilities of many - body states .",
    "we now study macroscopic entanglement of magnon states ( [ m - magnon state ] ) with various densities and wavenumbers by evaluating the index p.      most relevant parameters characterizing the magnon states are the number of magnons , @xmath35 , and the wavenumbers of magnons . because of the @xmath120 symmetry ,",
    "we assume that @xmath121 without loss of generality .",
    "furthermore , we assume that @xmath0 is even in order to avoid uninteresting complications .",
    "since we are interested in the asymptotic behavior for large @xmath0 , only the order of magnitudes of these parameters is important .",

    "@xmath48 and all magnons have different wavenumbers from each other , continuously occupying a part of the first brillouin zone . because of the translational invariance of the system in the @xmath25-space , it is sufficient to calculate the case where the magnons continuously occupy the first brillouin zone _ from the bottom _",

    "one is the stability against weak perturbations from noises or environments : a pure state is said to be _ fragile _ if its decoherence rate behaves as @xmath206 when perturbations from the noises or environments are weak , where @xmath207 is a positive constant .",
    "such a state is extremely unstable in the sense that its decoherence rate _ per spin",
    "_ increases as @xmath208 with increasing @xmath0 , until it becomes extremely large for huge @xmath0 however small is the coupling constant between the system and the noise or environment .",
    "sm showed that pure states with @xmath5 never become fragile in any noises or environments , whereas pure states with @xmath3 can become fragile , depending on the spectral intensities of the noise or environment variables .",
    "the other stability considered by sm is the stability against local measurements : a state is said to be _ stable against local measurements _ if an ideal ( projective ) measurement of any observable at a point @xmath19 does not alter the result of measurement of any observable at a distant point @xmath209 for sufficiently large @xmath210 .",
    "sm showed that this stability is equivalent to the ` cluster property ' , which is closely related to @xmath2 , if the cluster property for finite systems is properly defined .",
    "for example , a state is _ unstable _ against local measurements if @xmath3 , whereas a homogeneous @xcite state with @xmath5 is stable .",
    "we have shown that @xmath5 for magnon states of case ( b ) .",
    "therefore , these states never become fragile in any noises or environments , and they are stable against local measurements . since we have also shown that the bipartite entanglement of these states is extremely large , we find that the bipartite entanglement is basically independent of these fundamental stabilities . the same conclusion was obtained for chaotic quantum systems by two of the authors @xcite : they showed that @xmath5 for almost all energy eigenstates of macroscopic chaotic systems whereas their bipartite entanglement is nearly maximum .",
    "we have also shown that @xmath3 for magnon states of case ( c ) .",
    "therefore , these states can become fragile , depending on the spectral intensities of the noise or environment variables .",
    "furthermore , these states are unstable against local measurements . since we have seen that the bipartite entanglement of these states is small , we find again that the bipartite entanglement is basically independent of these fundamental stabilities . to understand the physics of this conclusion",
    ", the following simple example may be helpful .",
    "the w - state , @xmath211 has the _ same _ value of @xmath7 as the @xmath0-spin ghz state , i.e. , @xmath104 . on the other hand , @xmath5 for @xmath212 whereas @xmath3 for @xmath213 . as a result ,",
    "the decoherence rate of @xmath212 _ never _ exceeds @xmath6 by _ any _ weak classical noises , whereas the decoherence rate of @xmath213 becomes as large as @xmath10 in a long - wavelength noise .",
    "furthermore , @xmath212 is _ stable _ against local measurements , whereas @xmath213 is unstable .",
    "these results are physically reasonable because the w - state is nothing but a one - magnon state ( with @xmath124 ) , which can be generated easily by experiment : such a state does not seem very unstable .",
    "( see also sec .",
    "[ sec - origin ] . )",
    "it should be mentioned that another stability was studied by stockton _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite for a special state of case ( c ) , i.e. , for a dicke state which in our notation is written as @xmath214 .",
    "they showed that a bipartite entanglement measure of @xmath215 decreases very slowly as @xmath216 increases .",
    "here , @xmath217 means ` trace out @xmath216 spins ' .",
    "they thus concluded that the state is _",
    "robust_. although their conclusion might look contradictory to our conclusion , there is no contradiction .",
    "the stability ( robustness ) as discussed by stockton _ et al .",
    "_ is totally different from the fundamental stabilities that are discussed in the present paper .",
    "the dicke state is ` robust ' in the sense of stockton _ et al .",
    "_ , whereas in the senses of sm the state is ` fragile ' in noises or environments and ` unstable ' against local measurements .",
    "this demonstrates that stability can be defined in many different ways for many - body states .",
    "the ` cluster property , ' which is closely related to the index @xmath2 , of condensed states of interacting many bosons was previously studied in ref .",
    "it was shown there that @xmath3 for the ground state @xmath218 , which has a fixed number @xmath0 of bosons , if @xmath0 is large enough to give a finite density for a large volume .",
    "since magnons are approximate bosons , magnon states of case ( c ) may be analogous to this state . although deviations from ideal bosons become significant in case ( c ) , the deviations may be partly regarded as effective interactions among magnons .",
    "this analogy intuitively explains our result that @xmath3 for magnon states of case ( c ) .",
    "it was also shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that @xmath5 for a generalized coherent state @xmath219 , which was called there a coherent state of interacting bosons .",
    "this result may also be understood intuitively on the same analogy .",
    "that is , @xmath219 may be analogous to the state of eq .",
    "( [ spon ] ) , which has @xmath5 because it is a separable state as seen from eq .",
    "( [ separable ] ) .",
    "therefore , by analogy , @xmath2 should also be unity for @xmath219 , in consistency with the result of ref .",
    "@xcite , although @xmath219 is _ not _ separable .",
    "analogy like these may be useful for further understanding of systems of interacting many bosons and of many magnons .      we have shown that states with huge entanglement , as measured by either @xmath2 or @xmath7 , can be easily constructed by simply exciting many magnons on a separable state .",
    "we now discuss the physical origin of this fact .",
    "the most important point is that a magnon propagates spatially all over the magnet @xcite . by the propagation , quantum coherence",
    "is established between spatially separated points @xcite .",
    "therefore , by exciting a macroscopic number of magnons , one can easily construct states with huge entanglement .",
    "note that this should be common to most quantum systems , because hamiltonians of most physical systems should have a term which causes spatial propagation .",
    "for example , such a term includes the nearest - neighbor interaction of spin systems , the kinetic - energy term of the schrdinger equation of particles , the term composed of spatial derivative of a field operator in field theory .",
    "therefore , excitation of a macroscopic number of elementary excitations generates huge entanglement .",
    "neither randomness nor elaborate tuning is necessary",
    ".    this observation will be useful for _ theoretically _ constructing states with huge entanglement .",
    "_ experimentally _ , on the other hand , the stability should also be taken into account because unstable states would be hard to generate experimentally .",
    "we thus consider that states with @xmath3 should be much harder to generate experimentally than states with large @xmath7 .",
    "in other words , a state with large @xmath7 would be able to be generated rather easily , e.g. , by exciting many quasi - particles in a solid . in this respect ,",
    "a naive expectation that states with large entanglement would be hard to generate experimentally is false : it depends on the measure or index that is used to quantify the entanglement .",
    "this work is partially supported by grant - in - aid for scientific research .",
    "a. sugita is supported by japan society for the promotion of science for young scientists .",
    "the state vector of the @xmath35-magnon state with @xmath220 can be written as @xmath221 where @xmath222 . since the vcm is hermitian , we have only to calculate the following correlations ; @xmath223 , @xmath224 , @xmath225 , @xmath226 , @xmath227 , @xmath228 , where @xmath229 stands for @xmath230 .",
    "since @xmath53 is an eigenvector of @xmath231 , the state vector is invariant under a rotation about @xmath164-axis .",
    "therefore @xmath232 and @xmath233 .",
    "thus we calculate only @xmath234 we note that @xmath235 by symmetry , and @xmath236 when @xmath237 , we easily obtain @xmath238 , @xmath239 , and @xmath240 therefore , @xmath241 when @xmath242 , we note that @xmath243 where @xmath244 is a state vector in which @xmath35 spins including @xmath209-th spin are up , whereas @xmath245 spins including @xmath19-th spin are down .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath246 furthermore , since @xmath247 we obtain @xmath248 it is obvious that @xmath249 because @xmath53 is a linear combination of vectors whose @xmath35 spins are up and @xmath245 spins are down .",
    "therefore @xmath250 finally , since @xmath251 we obtain @xmath252 therefore , @xmath253 combining these results , we obtain the vcm as eq .",

    "we thus obtain eq .",
    "( [ e_max ] ) .",
    "for example , a ten - atom molecule can be regarded as a single particle , ten particles , and much more particles ( nuclei and electrons ) , in the energy ranges of @xmath264ev , @xmath265mev , and @xmath265ev , respectively .",
    "this statement would be understandable , from the discussion in endnote @xcite , for macroscopic variables that define equilibrium states .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the statement is also true for most macroscopic variables defining non - equilibrium states , such as the electric current density @xmath16 .",
    "that is , the macroscopic current density @xmath16 must be an average of the microscopic current density @xmath266 over a macroscopic region .",
    "the spatial average introduces a smoothing effect , and @xmath16 becomes a proper macroscopic variable .    some of macroscopic variables , such as the volume and temperature , in thermodynamics can not be represented as an additive operator . although the volume is additive , it is usually considered as a boundary condition rather than a quantum - mechanical observable .",
    "we follow this convention .",
    "regarding the temperature , it is a non - mechanical variable that can be defined only for equilibrium states .",
    "however , we note that at thermal equilibrium a macroscopic state is , hence the values of non - mechanical variables are , uniquely determined by a set of additive observables and the boundary conditions @xcite . therefore ,",
    "if two equilibrium states have distinct values of a non - mechanical variable they must have distinct values of some of the additive observables .",
    "it therefore seems that considering additive observables is sufficient .",
    "although we have not considered time evolution in this paper , the spatial propagation has been incorporated into our analysis for the following reason . a magnon state created by the magnon operator",
    "@xmath267 is an approximate eigenstate of a hamiltonian of a magnet .",
    "since an energy eigenstate is a stationary state , it is a state ` after all possible propagation is finished . '",
