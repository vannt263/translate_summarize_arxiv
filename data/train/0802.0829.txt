    "the study of strongly correlated electronic systems ( sces ) continues attracting the attention of the condensed matter community .",
    "these materials present complex phase diagrams that illustrates the competition which exists among phases with very different physical properties , such as @xmath3-wave superconductivity , antiferro- and ferro - magnetic order , charge- and orbital - order , multiferroic behavior , and several others .",
    "moreover , this complexity and phase competition lead to self - organized nano - scale inhomogeneities which are believed to generate giant responses , as in the famous colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) effect of the mn - oxides known as manganites.@xcite    recently , a new procedure to study oxide sces has been proposed .",
    "it involves the artificial creation of oxide multilayers with atomic - scale accuracy at the interface , via the use of techniques such as pulsed - laser deposition.@xcite potentially , these structures can have properties very different from those of the building blocks .",
    "one of the reasons for this expectation is that a transfer of charge could occur between the constituents leading , for example , to the stabilization of a metal at the interface between two insulators.@xcite the creation of novel two - dimensional states , as well as the possible applications of oxide multilayers in the growing field of oxide electronics , has given considerable momentum to these investigations .",
    "the development of the above mentioned accurate experimental techniques for the construction of oxide multilayers with atomic precision can have implications in the study of spin - tunnel - junctions,@xcite introducing a better control of their properties .",
    "these structures consist of two ferromagnetic ( fm ) metallic electrodes , separated by a thin insulating barrier .",
    "the resistance of this device depends on the relative orientation of the electrodes magnetizations .",
    "the tunneling magnetoresistance ( tmr ) is usually defined via the difference in resistances between the anti - parallel and parallel arrangements of the electrodes magnetic moments .",
    "half - metals , such as la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( lsmo ) , with an intrinsic nearly full magnetization , are ideal for these devices.@xcite    in the context of magnetic tunnel junctions , very interesting results were reported by bowen _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite using a lsmo / sto / lsmo trilayer .",
    "the sr concentration was 1/3 for la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( lsmo ) , and sto represents the insulator srtio@xmath2",
    ". a huge tmr ratio of more than 1800% was observed at very low temperatures 4  k , showing the advantages of using half - metallic lsmo as a ferromagnetic electrode in the junctions .",
    "however , in the same investigations it was reported that the large tmr survived only up to @xmath4270  k , lower than the curie temperature of lsmo(@xmath5=1/3 ) , which is @xmath4370  k. it was argued that the deterioration of the ferromagnetism near the lsmo / sto interface ( `` dead layer '' ) could be causing this tmr reduction .",
    "later , yamada _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite addressed this problem by comparing the sto / lsmo interface with others , such as lao / lsmo or sto / lmo / lsmo , where lao stands for laalo@xmath2 and lmo for lamno@xmath2 .",
    "those authors found that the magnetic behavior of lao / lsmo and sto / lmo / lsmo are much better than sto / lsmo in the sense that no dead - layer was found , opening a new path toward lsmo - based tmr junctions operating at room temperature .      in this paper , an alternative setup",
    "is proposed for a manganite trilayer system which is expected to have a very large magnetoresistance ( mr ) at low temperatures , at least according to modeling calculations reported below . the proposed geometry , and main idea behind its performance ,",
    "is presented in fig .",
    "the new system is made out entirely of manganite materials , with different hole doping concentrations.@xcite using all manganites may help in the interfacial contact between the components due to their similar lattice spacings .",
    "more specifically , in fig .  [ spin ]",
    "( a ) a trilayer system is represented .",
    "it contains two hole - doped mn - oxides , such as lsmo , and a central region made out of the undoped parent compound lmo .",
    "it is well known that lsmo is ferromagnetic and half - metallic for sufficiently large hole doping , while lmo is an a - type antiferromagnetic ( af ) insulator .",
    "@xcite the arrows in fig .",
    "[ spin ] ( a ) represent schematically the expected spin orientations in a one - dimensional arrangement , for simplicity .",
    "the most interesting detail of fig .",
    "[ spin ] ( a ) is the relative orientation of the spins between the metallic leads . for an @xmath6 number of layers in the central lmo region , the ferromagnetic moments of the leads are @xmath7-@xmath8",
    "this is expected to cause a very large resistance at low temperatures , since the carriers moving from one lead to the other not only must tunnel through the central insulating barrier , but in addition the spin species which can travel in one lead is blocked by the other .",
    "however , the anti - parallel configuration , which is mediated by the central region , is not strongly pinned in this arrangement : it is only a @xmath9 antiferromagnetic effective interaction which produces the ground state with anti - parallel leads moments .",
    "thus , relatively small magnetic fields can render the ferromagnetic moments parallel , substantially reducing the resistance .",
    "all these intuitive ideas will be substantiated via model calculations , described below .    for an @xmath10 number of layers in the central lmo region , the expected spin arrangement",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ spin ] ( b ) . in this case",
    "the magnetic moments of the leads will be parallel to one another , and the resistance will not be as large as for the configuration shown in fig .",
    "[ spin ] ( a ) .",
    "however , the lmo region still provided a tunneling barrier , and the performance of this case will be shown below to be quite acceptable , at least within modeling calculations .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "[ spin](c ) contains a crude representation of a more standard trilayer device .",
    "@xcite while the leads are still representing lsmo , the central region is now a band insulator , as it occurs in the much employed case of sto .",
    "the main focus of our effort will be the cases shown in fig .",
    "[ spin ] ( a ) and ( b ) , but some results for the setup shown in fig .",
    "[ spin ] ( c ) will also be discussed for completeness , and to clarify qualitative trends .      before proceeding to the presentation of the results , some of the theoretical approximations used must be clearly expressed for the benefit of the reader . with this paper ,",
    "our main intention is to motivate experimental groups to consider the materials and setups proposed in our study , involving a magnetically active manganite barrier , as opposed to a magnetically - inert band - insulator , as the widely used sto .",
    "however , it must be clearly stated that our calculations are qualitative at best and should be considered only as a guidance to understand the intuitive picture presented here .",
    "a variety of effects are not taken into account in this investigation ( and actually these effects can not be taken into account accurately within the current status of numerical simulations and hamiltonian modeling ) .",
    "_ ( 1 ) _ for instance , the lattice and orbital reconstructions are not incorporated , but only the electronic reconstruction is considered . in other words ,",
    "the atomic positions are considered to be rigid here .",
    "it would be the task of sophisticated _ ab - initio _ simulations to consider how the lattice relaxes at the interface between lmo and lsmo , and such future calculations are certainly strongly encouraged . _ ( 2 ) _ a second subject which is not addressed in this work is the issue of the infamous `` dead layer '' at the barrier / electrode interface , already briefly described in sec .",
    "[ intro_stj ] .",
    "dead layers affect the performance of several trilayer devices .",
    "we have attempted to mimic this dead layer altering by hand the chemical potential in the vicinity of the interface , but the results were not sufficiently satisfactory to be described in this paper .",
    "thus , this problem is left for future efforts . _",
    "( 3 ) _ another topic which is only briefly discussed is the influence of anisotropies : in most of the simulations below there is no `` easy '' axis introduced for the magnetization orientation . while for manganites in bulk form this is a reasonable assumption , in thin films it is known that in - plane magnetic anisotropies are induced by epitaxial strain.@xcite these anisotropies are the reason behind the abrupt changes in resistances observed when varying magnetic fields in magnetic tunnel junctions ( see , for instance , fig .  2 in ref .  ) .",
    "while in our numerical studies reported below the simulations are carried out mainly with isotropic heisenberg spins , a more proper analysis would have needed anisotropic terms , rendering these spins ising like . _",
    "( 4 ) _ a related topic involves the experimentally observed differences between the upper and lower electrodes in a trilayer junction , since the area of the bottom electrode is typically much wider than that of the upper one.@xcite this stabilizes anti - parallel orientations of the electrodes magnetic moments at some magnetic fields . in our simulations ,",
    "both electrodes are perfectly equivalent . however , for the reasons already mentioned in the previous subsection , we do stabilize a similar anti - parallel magnetic moment arrangement via the use of lmo as barrier , with an even number of sites and in zero external magnetic field . _",
    "( 5 ) _ finally , a practical assumption in our investigations is the focus on a one - dimensional ( 1d ) spin arrangement , described by the realistic double - exchange model for manganites ( albeit restricted to just one orbital ) .",
    "the restriction to a 1d configuration is needed for the numerical studies to be accurate ; higher dimensional arrangements would have increased so much the cpu time that a careful analysis would have been impossible . note that contrary to manganite bulk studies,@xcite where the analysis of small two - dimensional clusters is possible , here we will be carrying out an iterative loop to solve poisson s equation which regulates the charge transfer between materials ( see sec.[model - methods ] ) . at each step of the iterative process",
    ", an _ entire _ monte carlo ( mc ) process or density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) sweep is carried out ( see details below ) , thus increasing substantially the computer requirements .",
    "then , the restriction to a 1d geometry is caused by the cpu resources available .",
    "however , in the description of results below , we have focus on qualitative aspects which are expected to be robust , and we strongly believe that they will survive the increase in dimensionality .",
    "for example , the large magnetoresistance at low temperatures of the lsmo / lmo / lsmo setup , with an even number of layers for lmo , is believed to occur in any dimension of interest .",
    "the organization of the paper is the following . in sec .",
    "[ model - methods ] , the model hamiltonians and numerical methods are described .",

    "[ tnonzero ] , the influence of temperature is analyzed .",
    "as observed in some experiments ,  @xcite it is found that the large mr effect quickly deteriorates with increasing temperature .",
    "the influence of anisotropies is also studied as a possible cure to this problem . in sec .",
    "[ sto ] , for completeness , results of the modeling of a trilayer involving a band insulator ( such as sto ) as the barrier , instead of lmo , are reported .",

    "it is crucial to include the cation ions in the model ( to consider the charge neutrality condition ) and take into account long - range coulomb interactions between electrons and cation ions . in this study ,",

    "we have found that the monte carlo simulations at very low temperatures produce almost identical results as those calculated using the zero temperature canonical method , although at a considerably larger cost in cpu time .",
    "thus , at @xmath46=0 it is advantageous to use the optimization method .",
    "note that due to the need to solve poisson s equation iteratively , a monte carlo simulation or optimization procedure has to be carried out at each step , increasing substantially the computer time as compared with more standard simulations of bulk systems .",

    "the large mr effect at low temperature observed in the trilayer geometry described in this paper is an interesting effect worthy of experimental confirmation .",

    "in fact , previous experimental realizations of tmr devices suffered a rapid degradation with increasing temperatures ,  @xcite as mentioned in the introduction ( sec .",
    "[ intro_stj ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , our proposed trilayer system also has problems in this respect , as shown below , but possible avenues to solve this issue are discussed .    in fig .",
    "[ spin_alpha ] , classical @xmath71 spin correlation functions for two particular sites are shown as a function of temperature @xmath46 , computed with the monte carlo technique .",
    "one of the chosen sites is in the left lead , site 5 , and the other is in the right lead , site 16 , and they are symmetrically arranged with respect to the center for the @xmath100 cluster used . for comparison , the same correlation is shown for the case when the barrier is removed and the entire system is now a unique ferromagnetic metal .",
    "@xcite the latter decays with temperature as shown in fig .",
    "[ spin_alpha ] , indicating that the long - distance ferromagnetic tendencies survive up to @xmath1010.03 approximately .",
    "although this should not be considered as a critical temperature , due to the one dimensionality of the problem which introduces strong fluctuations at finite temperatures , at least it provides a good indicator of the strength of ferromagnetism as @xmath46 is increased .",
    "weak couplings into higher dimensional structures will likely stabilize this characteristic temperature into a true critical temperature .",
    "@xcite    the same spin correlation functions but now in the presence of the barrier is also shown in fig .",
    "[ spin_alpha ] for various values of @xmath38 . at low temperatures ,",
    "these correlation functions have the opposite sign ( minus ) as compared to the ones without the barrier .",
    "this is simply because in this trilayer case there is an even number of sites in the central region , and therefore the magnetic moments between the leads align antiferromagnetically ( sec .",
    "[ t=0 ] ) . here",
    "the calculations are carried out by first obtaining the electrostatic potential @xmath19 at high temperature , where the spins are not ordered , and then keeping this potential the same as the temperature is reduced .",
    "this procedure considerably alleviates the numerical effort , particularly regarding the poisson s equation iterations , and tests in small systems have shown that this trick does not alter the results qualitatively . as also seen in fig .",
    "[ spin_alpha ] , the spin correlation functions obtained by this method have a relatively minor dependence with @xmath38 .",
    "the main point to remark is that these spin correlations become negligible at a temperature @xmath102 , which is considerably smaller than the relevant temperature of the pure ferromagnetic system without the barrier . as a consequence ,",
    "it is clear that a strong similarity with previous experimental results for sto barriers  @xcite may exist in this case .",
    "expressed qualitatively , our results indicate that there is a temperature scale @xmath103 , much smaller than the critical temperature @xmath104 , where the orientation of the leads magnetic moments ceases to be antiferromagnetic . as shown below , this",
    "is correlated with important changes in the magnetoresistance effect .",
    "in fact , the large mr effect at low temperature seems to occur due to the existence of an effective coupling @xmath105 which produces the anti - parallel alignment of the leads magnetic moments .",
    "this is reasonable , since @xmath105 is an effective weak coupling across a tunneling insulating barrier . when the temperature is of the order of this coupling or larger , the anti - parallel arrangement is no longer preferable and in our model the leads moments rotate freely with respect to one another .",
    "a systematic study of the influence of the size of the central region @xmath31 on the classical @xmath71 spin correlations between the leads is reported in figure  [ spin_c ] .",
    "as expected ( sec .",
    "[ idea ] ) , for @xmath31 even ( odd ) these spin correlations are negative ( positive ) at low temperatures , indicating strong antiferromagnetic ( ferromagnetic ) correlations between the ferromagnetic leads moments .",
    "the magnitude of this correlation decreases as @xmath31 increases , in agreement with the expected reduction of the effective coupling @xmath105 discussed above .",
    "thus , the thinner the barrier is , the better the temperature effects become in the trilayer geometry proposed here , namely the higher @xmath103 is .    our discussion",
    "thus far has been based on the spin correlations at finite temperatures .",
    "it was concluded that the large resistance caused by the anti - parallel configuration of the ferromagnetic leads moments does not survive all the way to the ferromagnetic critical temperatures of the leads .",
    "this is indeed observed in fig .",
    "[ tmr ] , where at @xmath103 the mr effect is reduced to zero at fields such as @xmath73=0.001 - 0.003 , while at zero temperature [ fig",
    ".  [ cond_t0 ] ( b ) ] the mr effect was huge at the same fields .",
    "however , even though the mr effect is truly enormous at very low temperature , at higher temperatures it is not negligible , at least in the several teslas scale of magnetic fields @xmath73 .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ tmr ] , the mr ratio is plotted vs. temperature , for different values of @xmath73 .",

    "if it is assumed @xmath29@xmath41,000  t  the mr ratio can be as large as 100 or 500% at temperatures of the order of @xmath104/2 .    in the calculations described so far , no `` easy axis '' has been chosen .",
    "in other words , no anisotropies were introduced .",
    "however , the introductory discussion suggests that many materials , particularly when in thin - film form , do have an easy axis mainly due to the influence of the substrate ( sec .",
    "[ main_appr ] ) .",
    "if due to this effect the magnetic moments of the leads can not rotate `` freely '' with respect to one another as isotropic heisenberg vectors , but are pointing along a particular direction as ising variables , the temperature scale @xmath103 above which the magnetic moments of the leads become uncorrelated should increase : heisenberg - like isotropic spins can be disordered by thermal fluctuations more easily than ising - like spins . on the other hand , making more `` rigid '' the anti - parallel magnetic connection between the leads moments will also prevent their alignment in very small magnetic fields : larger magnetic fields may be needed to achieve the same effect as before , i.e. , large mr effect .",
    "these competing tendencies will be discussed in more detail below .    to investigate this issue ,",
    "extra couplings between classical @xmath71 spins are added to the model , as shown in fig .",
    "[ spin_2 ] . via direct heisenberg couplings between the classical spins , @xmath110 ( antiferromagnetic ) and @xmath111 ( ferromagnetic ) ,",
    "both the antiferromagnetic spin arrangement in the central region and the coupling between the center and the leads can be made more rigid .",
    "that this procedure helps regarding the @xmath103 problem is clear in fig .",
    "[ spin - special ] where the classical @xmath71-spin correlation functions are shown .",
    "contrary to the case of weakly coupled leads , now a robust spin correlation between them survives up to @xmath104 .",
    "however , the mr effect is not improving at very small fields ( see fig .",
    "[ tmr_s ] ) . on the contrary ,",
    "larger values of @xmath73 are needed to achieve the same mr effect as before ( for instance , the mr ratio at @xmath73=0.01 without anisotropies is 3000% at @xmath46@xmath40.001 , while it is 1500% here with anisotropy ) .",
    "thus , as already mentioned briefly , the overall conclusion is that there are two competing tendencies to consider in these investigations : ( i ) on one hand , a weak coupling among the leads , mediated by the central region , is needed in order for a tiny magnetic field to cause a huge effect in transport ; ( ii ) on the other hand , for the same reason , a small temperature can entirely wash out the effect . adding anisotropies increases the effective coupling between the leads magnetic moments , thus helping with the temperature issue ( ii ) , but reciprocally , larger magnetic fields are needed to achieve the same mr effect . investigating the subtle balance between these competing tendencies is a great challenge , both for theorists and experimentalists",
    "although the focus of our effort has been on the lsmo / lmo / lsmo trilayer , as mentioned in the introduction we have also carried out model hamiltonian simulations for the more standard case of a non - magnetic insulator as a barrier . a widely studied material for this purpose is sto , which is here mimicked simply by a tight - binding hamiltonian for the barrier , with its energy levels shifted by a one - particle site potential @xmath112 which controls the height of the barrier . in this section ,",
    "results for the case lsmo / sto / lsmo are briefly discussed , with the emphasis on qualitative aspects and comparisons with the case of lmo as barrier .",
    "the details of the model hamiltonian were already described in sec .",
    "[ model - methods ] , and the technique employed is the mc simulation . once again , it should be remarked that subtle effects such as `` dead layers '' are not considered in this study ( sec .",
    "[ main_appr ] ) , and their presence may affect quantitatively our conclusions .    the local electronic density @xmath70 is reported in fig .",
    "[ den_bi ] for the 1d lsmo / sto / lsmo model with different values of the site potential @xmath112 in the central region .",
    "it is observed that @xmath70 in the central region gradually increases from nearly zero to @xmath113 with decreasing @xmath112 , indicating that the barrier hight decreases with @xmath112 , and consequently the effective coupling between the leads becomes stronger .",
    "note that the lower band of the lead ( described by the de model ) is centered at @xmath114 , and thus the band of the central region and the lower band of the lead are perfectly aligned ( i.e. , zero barrier height ) when @xmath115 ( and @xmath116 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ tmr_v-7 ] , the mr ratio vs. temperature for the case @xmath117 is shown .",
    "notice that the mr effect becomes appreciable at temperatures comparable to the curie temperature of the individual ferromagnetic leads .",
    "this is qualitatively similar to the effect observed in lsmo / lmo / lsmo for the case where an anisotropy was introduced ( fig .",
    "[ tmr_s ] ) , which effectively caused a stronger effective coupling between the magnetic moments of the left and right leads .",
    "thus , it appears that the value @xmath117 chosen for this example allows for a robust left - right coupling ( as also expected from @xmath70 shown in fig .",
    "[ den_bi ] ) , concomitant with the survival of a large mr effect up to the curie temperature .",
    "it is also observed in fig .",
    "[ tmr_v-7 ] that because of the strong effective coupling between the leads , the mr ratio for small magnetic fields ( @xmath118 ) is not as large as in the case of the small effective coupling discussed below ( fig .",
    "[ tmr_v-4 ] ) .",
    "figure [ tmr_v-4 ] shows results for the same parameters as in fig .  [ tmr_v-7 ] , but simply making the height of the barrier @xmath112 much larger , i.e. , the left and right leads being nearly decoupled .",
    "three effects are obvious to the eye : ( i ) the large mr effect appears now at lower temperatures . for example , in fig .",
    "[ tmr_v-4 ] the mr becomes nonzero at t@xmath40.02 , while in fig .",
    "[ tmr_v-7 ] the same occurred at a higher temperature @xmath119 .",
    "( ii ) on the other hand , increasing the height of the barrier much increases the mr ratio at low temperatures and small magnetic fields . for example , in fig .",
    "[ tmr_v-4 ] the mr ratio is about 1,000% at t@xmath40.001 and @xmath120 , while in fig .",
    "[ tmr_v-7 ] it is about 200% at the same @xmath46 and @xmath73 .",
    "this occurs because the barrier is so large in fig .",
    "[ tmr_v-4 ] that in the absence of magnetic fields , the magnetic moments of the left and right leads are almost decoupled , and thus applying a very small magnetic field is enough to align the leads magnetic moment and increase conductance .",
    "( iii ) the dependence of magnetic fields on the mr ratio is very mild ( compared to fig .",
    "[ tmr_v-7 ] ) , namely changing @xmath73 from 0.001 to 0.03 only alters the results by a factor 2 at the most .",
    "this is because the almost decoupled leads moments are forced to align in the magnetic field direction by a very small @xmath73",
    ". a further increase of @xmath73 does not change the moments orientation at low temperatures .",
    "thus , an interesting and simple picture emerges from these qualitative investigations , which are in agreement with the results shown before for the case of lsmo / lmo / lsmo : ( 1 ) if the barrier between the magnetic leads is very large ( i.e. , the effective coupling between the leads is small ) , the magnetic moments of the ferromagnetic leads are nearly decoupled ( in the absence of anisotropies ) at @xmath73=0 , even at low temperatures .",
    "thus , the double effect of large barrier and concomitant weakly coupled leads causes a large @xmath73=0 resistance , which enhances the mr effect at low temperatures as compared with a lower barrier ( i.e. , the large effective coupling between the leads ) .",
    "( 2 ) however , the large barrier and weakly coupled leads are fragile upon increasing the temperature .",
    "in this paper , the use of lsmo / lmo / lsmo as a spin - tunnel - junction is proposed .",
    "the main difference with other previous efforts is in the use of a manganite barrier .",
    "this would improve the lattice spacing matching between the constituents , hopefully also alleviating the complications found in previous investigations such as the infamous interfacial dead layers of sto / lsmo .",
    "however , the main point of this study is not just the all - manganite character of the trilayer , but the antiferromagnetic properties of lmo . for an even number of lmo layers ,",
    "the spin order in the ground state is such that the magnetic moments of the ferromagnetic lsmo leads are anti - parallel ( while for an odd number of layers , they are parallel ) .",
    "an anti - parallel - leads configuration has a large resistance .",
    "but the effective coupling leading to this anti - parallel lsmo - moments configuration is weak , rendering the ground state fragile .",
    "in fact , numerical simulations show that very small magnetic fields @xmath73 can alter drastically the original ground state at @xmath121 , by aligning the magnetic moments of the ferromagnetic lsmo leads . a very large mr effect is observed in this transition , at least at low temperatures .",
    "note that in arriving to our conclusions a large number of approximations have been made , all clearly described in sec .",
    "[ main_appr ] .",
    "however , we still expect that our theoretical analysis is qualitatively correct and may serve as a motivation for a real experimental realization of the lsmo / lmo / lsmo magnetic junction .",
    "other effects , such as the influence of temperature , were also considered in this study .",
    "together with the analysis of sto as barrier , overall trends were identified .",
    "very insulating barriers ( inducing a very week effective coupling between the leads ) can lead to low - temperature states which are easily destabilized by small magnetic fields , causing a large mr effect .",
    "however , thermal fluctuation rapidly washes out these large effects . reducing the barrier height or introducing anisotropies",
    "make the original ground state at @xmath121 more robust with increasing temperature , but this reduces the low - temperature mr effect at small magnetic fields .",
    "a balance between these two tendencies is needed to find optimal trilayers for real devices .",
