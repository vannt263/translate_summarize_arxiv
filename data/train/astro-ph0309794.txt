    "the formation and evolution of the milky way galaxy remains one of the outstanding questions of modern astronomy .",
    "recent observations and n - body simulations lend increasing support to a hierarchical assembly model , where the halo of our galaxy is composed ( at least in part ) of tidally disrupted dwarf galaxies .",
    "n - body models suggest that dwarf galaxies disrupted long ago should still be visible as coherent streams of stars within the galactic halo @xcite .",
    "the most striking example is the discovery of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy in the process of being tidally disrupted by the milky way @xcite .",
    "@xcite detect stellar debris from the sgr dwarf over much of the sky .",
    "at least one additional stream , the so - called monoceros stream , surrounds the disk of the milky way , and may be associated with another disrupted satellite galaxy @xcite . clearly ,",
    "examination of the locations , motions , and compositions of the stars in the halo ( and thick disk ) should provide us with a more complete record of the milky way s formation history .",
    "previous surveys have demonstrated that blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars provide excellent tracers of the stellar halo @xcite .",
    "bhb stars are numerous , exceeding the number density of rr lyraes by roughly a factor of 10 @xcite .",
    "bhb stars are also luminous , and hence observable to large distances .",
    "bhb stars exhibit a small dispersion in absolute magnitude , making reasonably accurate photometric distance estimates possible .",
    "furthermore , bhb stars are bluer than most competing stellar populations , making their identification on the basis of broadband colors relatively straightforward .    in the past , objective - prism surveys were the primary source of candidate bhb stars @xcite , often supplemented by @xmath10 and strmgren photometry . the recent work of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and",
    "@xcite shows that photometric surveys can be used to identify structure in number counts of a - type , f - type , and rr lyrae stars at distances of up to @xmath6100 kpc .",
    "the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) now provides complete , uniform @xmath11 photometry over the entire sky .",
    "here we demonstrate that two - color near - infrared photometry can also be used to efficiently select candidate bhb stars . a properly selected set of 2mass bhb candidates will permit , for the first time , an all - sky survey of the `` inner '' galactic halo . bhb stars at the limiting apparent magnitude of the 2mass catalog ( @xmath12 ) sample the halo of the galaxy up to helio - centric distances of @xmath13 kpc .",
    "this corresponds to a maximum galacto - centric distance of @xmath14 kpc in the anti - center direction .",
    "we study number counts of objects with bhb colors in the 2mass catalog , and find no obvious overdensities at high galactic latitudes that might be associated with known or newly identified streams .",
    "this lack of projected spatial structure emphasizes the need to obtain full six - dimensional kinematic information provided by radial velocities and proper motions .",
    "conveniently , 2mass - selected bhb stars are bright enough to be included in the existing ucac2 @xcite and spm 3.0 @xcite proper motion catalogs .",
    "in addition , @xmath12 stars can be observed with moderate signal - to - noise spectroscopy on 1m-2.5 m class telescopes .",
    "the catalog of bhb candidates we provide herein forms the basis for a uniform spectroscopic survey .",
    "a spectroscopic survey of 2mass - selected bhb candidates is particularly well - suited to study the structure of the inner halo and thick disk .",
    "sufficiently accurate radial velocities and proper motions will permit identification of star streams at small scales , in particular through inspection of angular momentum phase space @xcite , and for measurement of the global rotation of the inner halo at the largest scales .",
    "previous surveys have found evidence for ( i ) no halo rotation @xcite , ( ii ) a small prograde rotation @xcite , and ( iii ) retrograde rotation @xcite .",
    "perhaps these conflicting observational results indicate that the halo velocity field has substructure , an issue best addressed by an all - sky survey .",
    "the important question of how the metal - weak thick disk @xcite is kinematically related to the inner halo population can also be pursued with such a survey .",
    "we begin by studying the efficacy of using 2mass near - ir photometry to select bhb stars . in ",
    "2 we introduce the century survey galactic halo project , a survey that provides a complete , spectroscopically - identified sample of blue stars to the depth of the 2mass photometry . in ",
    "3 we consider the ability of 2mass photometry to differentiate bhb stars from other blue objects , including a - type stars of higher surface gravity ( many of which are likely halo and thick - disk blue stragglers ) in the century survey galactic halo project sample . in ",
    "4 we apply a two - color photometric selection to the full 2mass catalog , and look for overdensities in the number counts of objects with bhb - like colors . in  5",
    "we discuss a two - point angular correlation analysis of the 2mass - selected objects , and use simulated star streams to understand our sensitivity to structure .",
    "we conclude in  6 .",
    "the century survey galactic halo project is a photometric and spectroscopic survey from which we select relatively blue stars as probes of the milky way halo . @xcite",
    "includes a detailed description of the sample selection , data reduction , and analysis techniques . in brief , we obtained johnson @xmath15 and cousins @xmath16 broadband imaging for a @xmath17 strip using the 8 ccd mosaic camera @xcite on the kpno 0.9 m telescope .",
    "the average depth of the photometry is @xmath18 .",
    "we then use the ccd photometry to select blue @xmath19 stars with @xmath20 for follow - up spectroscopy using the fast spectrograph @xcite on the whipple observatory 1.5 m telescope .",
    "moderate signal - to - noise ( s / n@xmath2130 ) , medium - resolution ( 2.3  ) spectra allow us to measure radial velocities , temperatures , surface gravities , metallicities , and spectral types for the stars .",
    "the century survey galactic halo project sample contains 764 objects . in this paper",
    "we make use of the 553 objects with @xmath22 .",
    "we choose the @xmath22 cut to match the depth of the 2mass catalog and to avoid objects with poor near - ir photometry .",
    "the century survey galactic halo project sample consists predominantly of f- and a - type stars plus a small number of unusual objects ( i.e. , white dwarfs and subdwarfs ) .",
    "the a - type stars have a large range of metallicity ( @xmath23 [ fe / h ] @xmath24 ) , a large velocity dispersion ( @xmath25 km s@xmath26 ) , and distance estimates that identify them as members of the inner halo and thick - disk populations @xcite .",
    "one of the primary goals of the century survey galactic halo project is to use bhb stars to trace potential star streams in the halo .",
    "the primary difficulty in using bhb stars as tracer objects is the need to distinguish reliably between low surface - gravity bhb stars and the higher surface - gravity a dwarfs and blue stragglers . in @xcite",
    "we devote careful attention to the reliable classification of bhb stars .",
    "we apply the techniques of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and find 26 high likelihood bhb stars among the 96 a - type stars with @xmath22 .",
    "we use this spectroscopically identified sample of stars to test the efficacy of 2mass photometry for selecting bhb stars .",
    "figure [ fig : vrsample ] shows the ( ) @xmath27 distribution of the @xmath22 stars in the century survey galactic halo project .",
    "all of the bhb stars fall within the color range @xmath28 .",
    "figure [ fig : vrsample]b , a useful guide for observers , plots the fraction of a - type and bhb stars found in samples selected by @xmath29 less than the color marked on the x - axis .",
    "bhb stars , for example , constitute 54% of all ( @xmath22 ) stars selected with @xmath30 .",
    "thus , broadband color selection is an efficient selection criteria for bhb stars , and one that we explore for the 2mass catalog .",
    "we access the complete 2mass point source catalog @xcite and find matches for every object in the century survey galactic halo project .",
    "the average 2mass photometric uncertainty in the colors of the @xmath22 century survey galactic halo project objects is @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "four objects have atypically poor errors @xmath33 ; we exclude these stars from the analysis .",
    "the @xmath22 century survey galactic halo project sample has a @xmath34-band magnitude limit of @xmath35 .",
    "figure [ fig : jhsample ] shows the 2mass @xmath36 and @xmath37 color distribution of the @xmath22 century survey galactic halo project sample from figure [ fig : vrsample ] .",
    "it is clear from           figure [ fig : jhsample]a that @xmath36 provides a useful discriminant between the f - type , a - type , and bhb stars in the century survey galactic halo project sample .",
    "the bhb stars are substantially bluer than the majority of competing objects . by contrast , @xmath37 ( figure [ fig : jhsample]b ) provides much less discrimination between the f - type , a - type , and bhb stars .",
    "figure [ fig : jhsample]c shows that bhb stars constitute 41% of stars selected with colors @xmath38 , comparable to the ( ) sample selection .",
    "a @xmath38 sample of stars is 65% complete for bhb stars .",
    "a @xmath39 selected sample of stars , on the other hand , is 96% complete for bhb stars , but bhb stars constitute only 29% of the sample .",
    "we conclude that a @xmath39 selection is optimal for completeness ; a @xmath38 selection is optimal for observational efficiency .",
    "we employ the @xmath38 color selection criteria in the following sections .",
    "we can use the @xmath37 color to exclude clear _",
    "non_-bhb stars from our samples .",
    "figure [ fig : jhsample]b shows that all bhb stars fall within the color range @xmath4 . applying this @xmath37 color limit to the @xmath38 and @xmath39 samples",
    "improve their identification efficiency to 47% and 32% , respectively .",
    "we use the @xmath4 color selection criteria in the following sections .",
    "we use the two - color selection discussed above to generate all - sky maps from the complete 2mass point source catalog .",
    "our present goal is to look for obvious projected spatial structure in the distribution of bhb and a - type stars .",
    "@xcite perform a similar analysis , selecting m giants from the 2mass point catalog , and find dramatic tidal streams from the sagittarius dwarf galaxy       3.8 in       circling the sky .",
    "the major difference between our maps and those of @xcite is that the absolute magnitude of a bhb star is fainter than for an m giant .",
    "however , we expect that the density of bhb stars is comparable to the density m giants .    given the reported detection of sgr - stream m giants , it is informative to quantify the number of bhb stars that might be detected with sufficiently deep samples . deriving a ratio of bhbs to m giants is complicated by the fact that m giants are found in metal - rich populations , while bhb stars are found largely in metal - poor populations .",
    "tidal streams from a dwarf galaxy merger will likely possess _ both _ metal - rich and metal - poor populations .",
    "the sgr stream , for example , has been identified both with giants @xcite and with horizontal branch stars @xcite . for this exercise",
    ", we assume that stars in a tidal stream produce horizontal branch ( hb ) stars and red giant ( rg ) stars at an equal rate , and estimate the ratio of hb stars to rg stars by inspecting their lifetimes on yonsei - yale isochrones @xcite .",
    "in particular , we consider the ratio of bright giants near the tip of the rg branch to the hb with the isochrones populated by giants with luminosities brighter that the yale horizontal - branch location , i.e. , @xmath40 .    according to the yonsei - yale isochrones , and the work of @xcite , the lifetime of a star on the hb is 100 - 150 myr .",
    "this timescale is almost independent of helium content , for y = 0.24 - 0.29 , and metallicity , z , for z = 0.001 to z = 0.02 .",
    "we assume that the majority of hb lifetime is spent at roughly constant luminosity before the star evolves up onto the agb ( if the envelope mass is large ) or onto a white dwarf cooling curve ( if the envelope mass is small ) .           for the bright rg stars , the lifetime spent with @xmath41 is 30 myr for z = 0.01 - 0.02 and 35 - 40 myr for z = 0.001 , for stars with masses in the range @xmath42 .",
    "the lifetime for @xmath43 is 70 - 80 myr , and is again roughly independent of z. the lifetime for @xmath44 is 15 - 20 myr .",
    "the most luminous ( massive ) stars are not expected to contribute significantly in old stellar populations .",
    "lower mass stars spend very short times near the tip of the rg branch , hence will also have little impact on our rough estimates .    comparing the above lifetimes",
    ", we estimate the relative number of hb : rg stars in a volume - limited sample should be on the order 5:1 for @xmath44 red giants , 3:1 for @xmath45 red giants , and 1.5 - 2.0:1 for @xmath46       7.1 in       red giants . the @xcite selection criteria and",
    "survey depth suggests that they trace @xmath47 m giants , though they should also detect @xmath48 = 100 - 200 @xmath49 red giants to 10 kpc .",
    "thus the 2mass bhb sample should include 3 - 5 hb stars for every m giant star in the @xcite maps .",
    "because the yonsei - yale isochrones are unable to distinguish bhb stars from other hb stars , the hb : rg ratio 3 - 5:1 is likely an upper limit to the bhb : rg ratio .",
    "the bhb : rg ratio ultimately depends on the metallicity of the stellar population : color - magnitude diagrams of metal rich globular clusters , for example , show that the red giant branch is far more populated than the horizontal branch ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite study bhb stars in the sgr stream and find that a metal - poor population constitutes @xmath610% of the stellar population .",
    "this implies that the bhb : rg ratio in the predominantly metal - rich sgr stream is more like 1:2 - 3 .",
    "we conclude that the number density of bhb stars is comparable , on average , to m giants in tidal debris from satellites like the sgr dwarf .",
    "it is not known whether the halo is composed entirely of tidal debris ; it is likely that the number density of bhb stars exceeds that of m giants in the metal poor halo .",
    "we now map the inner halo with bhb and a - type stars .",
    "we begin with the full 2mass point source catalog of 470,992,970 objects .",
    "we select objects that have photometric quality flags of a or b ( objects with photometric errors less than @xmath50 mag ) , and reject objects with photometric quality flags d , e , f , u , or x ( objects with poor or non - existent photometry ) .",
    "we also reject objects with contamination flags p , d , s , and b ( objects contaminated by nearby bright stars or other objects , as well as ccd artifacts ) . finally , we reject all objects in the region of the galactic plane @xmath51 .",
    "our interest is in viewing the halo uncontaminated by thin - disk stars and heavy reddening from dust and gas in the galactic plane .",
    "the galactic latitude selection reduces the 2mass point source catalog to a more manageable 78,464,293 objects .",
    "we perform a preliminary color cut @xmath52 and @xmath53 to further reduce the catalog size to 7,426,805 blue objects .",
    "we then calculate and apply reddening corrections from @xcite to derive intrinsic de - reddened colors @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "our working catalog of bhb candidates contains 99,431 2mass point sources selected _ after _ reddening corrections by @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .",
    "based on our comparison with the century survey galactic halo project , we expect that 47% of the these blue point sources are bhb stars , 39% are higher gravity a - type stars , and 14% are miscellaneous objects ( mostly early f - types ) .    figure [ fig : skymaps ] shows equal - area hammer - aitoff projections of the two - color selected 2mass bhb candidates .",
    "we show three magnitude ranges .",
    "the top panel shows the apparent magnitude range @xmath57 , the middle panel @xmath58 , and the bottom panel @xmath59 .",
    "we bin objects into pixels of area 1 square degree .",
    "the sky maps are in galactic coordinates centered on @xmath60 .",
    "inspection of the sky maps reveals a number of salient features .",
    "the lmc and smc are clearly visible in all three magnitude ranges , presumably due to the presence of their bright o- and b - type stars .",
    "the galactic plane is also clearly visible , despite our efforts to eliminate it .",
    "gould s belt slants down from @xmath61 to @xmath62 .",
    "small empty regions near the @xmath63 boundaries result from a combination of large reddening corrections and from our preliminary color cut .",
    "perhaps the most impressive feature in the maps is the galactic bulge , which extends nearly to the galactic poles : the surface number density of objects towards the galactic center @xmath64 converges to the surface number density of objects towards the anti - center @xmath65 at galactic latitude @xmath66 ( see figure [ fig : density ] ) .",
    "the sky maps contain no obvious structures like the sagittarius stream evident in the sky maps of @xcite .",
    "the small clump of objects below the galactic plane near @xmath67 ( figure [ fig : skymaps ] , bottom panel ) is coincident with a clump in the m giant map @xcite , but it is offset from the sagittarius stream by approximately 15@xmath68 , and is probably not associated with this structure .",
    "we now look for structure in space , but caution that distance estimates to the bhb candidates are rough estimates at best . in principle , distances to bhb stars can be accurately determined if the metallicity is known . however , published @xmath69-metallicity relations for horizontal branch stars vary considerably , with values of the slope ranging between 0.15 @xcite and 0.30 @xcite and values of the zero point falling into two groups , @xmath60.30 mag apart .",
    "we use the _ hipparcos_-derived zero point ,                      @xmath70 at [ fe / h ] = @xmath711.60 @xcite , based on the statistical parallax of 147 halo rr lyrae field stars .",
    "we employ the recently measured @xmath69-metallicity slope @xmath72 @xcite , based on photometry and spectroscopy of 108 rr lyrae stars in the large magellanic cloud .",
    "we lack spectroscopic metallicity determinations for the bhb candidates ; we thus use the mean metallicity of the century survey galactic halo project bhb stars , [ fe / h]=@xmath73 , to obtain @xmath74 .",
    "because bhb stars have an @xmath6a0 spectral type and , by definition , @xmath75 , this @xmath69 corresponds to @xmath76 .",
    "bhb stars with more extreme metallicities of [ fe / h]=0 or [ fe / h]=@xmath77 will have absolute magnitudes that differ by @xmath78  a factor of @xmath7916% in distance .    for the remainder of this paper , we assume @xmath76 to obtain distance estimates to the 2mass - selected bhb candidates .",
    "the magnitude range @xmath80 thus corresponds to an approximate helio - centric distance range @xmath81 kpc .",
    "we note that this distance range is substantially shorter for the 53% of the bhb candidates that        are a- or early f - type dwarfs . a5 and f0 dwarfs have @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the corresponding distance ranges for a5 and f0 dwarfs are reduced by factors of 0.63 and 0.50 , respectively , compared to bhb stars .",
    "we plot the distribution of bhb candidates in space ( figure [ fig : slice ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : slice]a shows the bhb candidates from a @xmath84 wedge selected with @xmath85 .",
    "the x@xmath86 axis points in the direction of the galactic anti - center , @xmath87 , the y@xmath86 axis points in the direction of solar motion , @xmath88 , and the z@xmath86 axis points in the direction of the north galactic pole , @xmath89 . in figure",

    "the gap in the middle of figure [ fig : slice]b is the galactic plane exclusion region . although the 2mass bhb candidates are not distributed uniformly in space , we find no obvious spatial structure except that associated with the galactic plane .",
    "the distribution of inner - halo bhb candidates appears remarkably smooth . perhaps this uniformity is not surprising :",
    "existing observations and simulations suggest that the inner halo _ should _ be smooth .",
    "known structures like the sagittarius star stream and the monoceros ring are located at galacto - centric distances greater than 20 kpc , beyond the region sampled by the 2mass - selected bhb candidates .",
    "in addition , theoretical simulations suggest that star streams from disrupted satellites become well - mixed with the underlying stellar populations of the galaxy after a few gyrs , and show little spatial structure , especially in the inner halo , where orbital time scales are relatively short @xcite . this picture is in agreement with @xcite who argues , based on the proper motions of solar - neighborhood stars , that there are at least 400 streams in the local stellar halo . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite find evidence for inner halo structure in angular       3.2 in       momentum space .",
    "this suggests that old star streams that lack spatial coherence may still be detectable with six - dimensional information .",
    "the two - point angular correlation function provides a quantitative measure of structure , and is commonly used as a measure of large scale structure in galaxy redshift surveys . here",
    ", we apply the two - point angular correlation function to the catalog of 2mass - selected bhb candidates . @xcite performed a similar two - point angular correlation function analysis on 4,400 bhb candidates from the hk objective - prism survey , and found an excess of stellar pairs with angular separations less than 10 arcmin .",
    "their result is significant at the 5-@xmath92 level , and motivates us to look for similar correlation in the 2mass - selected bhb candidates .",
    "recently , @xcite calculate angular correlation functions for faint , f - colored stars located at @xmath93 in the millennium galaxy catalog .",
    "they find no signal at angular scales less than @xmath7 .",

    "we are concerned , as pointed out in @xcite , about the inclusion of bhb stars associated with globular clusters .",
    "correlated bhb stars from globular clusters could produce a spurious signal at small angular separations .",

    "large angular scale structure near the galactic plane ( structure with @xmath114 ) likely causes the systematic offset of the correlation function above zero in the right - hand column of figure [ fig : angcorr2 ] .",
    "the sharply increasing density gradient near the galactic plane may also cause a systematic offset in the correlation function , though when we adjust our density profile fit near the galactic plane , the offset in correlation changes only a small amount .",
    "the angular correlation at intermediate latitudes @xmath106 , where the density profile appears quite smooth , remains a surprise .",
    "one possible explanation for the rising small - scale amplitude in our correlation analysis at intermediate latitudes is that we are detecting structure in the @xcite reddening map .",

    "@xcite observe filamentary structure at the smallest scales resolved by the map . to test whether reddening causes the rise in angular correlation at intermediate galactic latitudes , we calculate the angular correlation for three different magnitude ranges ( figure [ fig : angcorr2 ] ) .",
    "because reddening is a foreground effect , it is intrinsic to all of the bhb candidates and should have the _ same _ angular scale in different magnitude bins .",
    "however , it is clear from figure [ fig : angcorr2 ] that the scale of the correlation changes with apparent magnitude .",
    "thus we rule out residual foreground reddening as the cause of the rising small - scale amplitude in correlation at low latitudes .",
    "we associate the rising angular correlation of the bhb candidates at intermediate galactic latitudes with some kind of structure in the thick disk .",
    "we note that the angular correlation becomes significant at the same galactic latitudes where the stellar density rapidly increases in figure [ fig : density ] .",
    "table [ tab : prop ] shows that the distance of these objects above the galactic plane ranges @xmath117 kpc .",
    "the scale height of the thick disk is @xmath61 kpc ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their table 1 ) , and the local volume density of the thick disk is @xmath650 times that of the halo .",
    "thus stars in the range @xmath118 kpc are most likely associated with the thick disk and not the halo .",
    "given the estimated range of distances , 0.1@xmath68 and 1@xmath68 angular scales corresponds to _ physical _ scales of @xmath610 and @xmath6100 pc .",
    "this thick - disk structure could be in the distribution of stars , for example , moving groups of young a stars from the thin disk or open clusters that have been deposited by previous dwarf interactions .",
    "alternatively , this thick - disk structure could be dark clouds creating the appearance of a patchy stellar distribution .",
    "we can not discriminate among the sources of structure without radial velocities , but we note that thick - disk structure may be consistent with expectations from cosmological simulations .",
    "@xcite study a single disk galaxy assembly in a @xmath119cdm simulation and find that 60% of the `` thick disk '' consists of tidal debris from multiple satellites .",
    "we show below that a simulated star stream can contribute structure to the correlation function .",
    "we now compare our results with those of @xcite .",
    "the lack of correlation exhibited by our high galactic latitude @xmath5 bhb candidates is in clear disagreement with @xcite .",
    "however , the hk survey fields cover galactic latitudes as low as @xmath120 , with a small number of fields extending to @xmath121 .",
    "thus we consider the @xmath106 bhb candidate sample a more accurate comparison with @xcite .",
    "indeed , the bottom left - hand side of figure [ fig : angcorr2 ] shows the same features reported by @xcite : a rising correlation towards smaller angular scales and a significant correlation in the smallest angular bin .",
    "the major difference is that the amplitude of our angular correlations are approximately half that of @xcite .",
    "the @xcite sample is comprised of roughly 85% bhb stars .",
    "it is possible that non bhb - stars in our sample dilute our angular correlations , but we have no expectation that bhb stars cluster more or less strongly than non - bhb stars .",
    "instead , we believe that the hk survey fields located @xmath122 contribute the excess signal .",
    "we note that these low galactic latitude fields in the hk survey are concentrated around @xmath123 and @xmath87 , locations where significant structure is apparent in figure [ fig : skymaps ] .",
    "the correlation function of the @xmath107 sample of bhb candidates ( figure [ fig : angcorr2 ] right - hand side ) shows correlation at even higher significance levels than found by @xcite .",
    "thus , it is likely that structure in the thick disk , present in the hk survey fields with @xmath124 , produces the excess bhb pairs that @xcite find .",
    "finally , we investigate a star stream as a possible source of the non - zero correlation function in figure [ fig : angcorr2 ] , and test at what level we can rule out the presence of a star stream amongst the high - latitude bhb candidates .",
    "the sagittarius stream in the @xcite plot of 2mass - selected m giants appears to have a @xmath125 fwhm across the southern sky . using this structure as a rough guide",
    ", we simulate a @xmath7 wide star stream and insert it into the high galactic latitude @xmath5 bhb candidate catalog .",
    "figures [ fig : stream]a and [ fig : stream]b show the effect of the simulated stream on the correlation function for surface densities in the stream of 0.5 objects deg@xmath8 and 1.0 objects deg@xmath8 .",
    "the underlying bhb candidate catalog has an average surface density of 0.5 objects deg@xmath8 .",
    "figure [ fig : stream]a shows that a star stream with the same density as the bhb candidate catalog results in a detectable increase in angular correlation at all scales . while a similar systematic offset is seen in the @xmath107 bhb candidate sample ( figure [ fig : angcorr2 ] , right - hand column ) , there are no visible stream - like structures in those maps with the appearance of the simulated streams .",
    "figure [ fig : stream]b more clearly shows the increase in correlation at small angular scales , and the inflection point at the correct @xmath7 scale .",
    "we use @xmath126 bins to increase the s / n of the bins ,           and conclude that the high - latitude bhb candidate catalog is consistent with having no @xmath125 wide star stream with density greater than 0.33 objects deg@xmath8 at the 95% confidence level .",
    "we can place no limit on extremely wide star streams that might cover most of the sky at the depth of this survey .",
    "we use 2mass near - ir photometry to select bhb candidates for an all - sky survey .",
    "a @xmath1 sample of bhb stars ranges @xmath81 kpc , and thus traces the thick disk and inner halo of the milky way .",
    "we base the sample selection on the century survey galactic halo project , a survey that provides a complete , spectroscopically - identified sample of blue stars to the depth of the 2mass photometry .",
    "we investigate the efficacy of 2mass photometry , and find that a @xmath3 , @xmath4 color - selected sample of stars is 65% complete for bhb stars , and is composed of 47% bhb stars . increasing the @xmath36 color limit to @xmath39 increases the completeness for bhb stars to 96% , but reduces the percentage of bona - fide bhb stars in the sample to 32% .",
    "we apply the two - color @xmath3 , @xmath127 photometric selection to the full 2mass catalog , and plot the distribution of the bhb - candidate objects .",
    "the 2mass bhb sample should include an equivalent number of bhb stars compared to m giants in the @xcite maps . however , we see no obvious overdensities in the number counts of the bhb candidates with helio - centric distances @xmath81 kpc .",
    "a two - point angular correlation analysis of the bhb candidates reveals no significant structure at high galactic latitudes @xmath5 .",
    "however , we find increasing angular correlation at @xmath9 for lower galactic latitudes .",
    "this structure may explain the @xcite result , and suggests that bhb stars in the thick disk are correlated at scales of 10 - 100 pc .",
    "we propose that clean samples of the inner halo must be carefully constructed with @xmath5 .",
    "we insert simulated star streams into the data and conclude that the high galactic latitude bhb candidates are consistent with having no @xmath125 wide star stream with density greater than 0.33 objects deg@xmath8 at the 95% confidence level . because stars from disrupted satellites are spatially well - mixed after a few orbits , the lack of observed overdensities at high galactic latitudes suggests there have been no major accretion events in the inner halo in the last few gyrs .",
    "@xcite show that strong correlations in phase space remain from past satellite mergers , emphasizing the need for full kinematic information provided by radial velocities and proper motions .    in the future we will obtain spectroscopic identifications and radial velocities for 2mass - selected bhb candidates as part of the century survey galactic halo project .",
    "as our statistics improve , we will be able to measure an accurate local density of bhb versus other stars .",
    "the local density of bhb stars is a poorly constrained quantity , yet quite important for the normalization of halo model density profiles .",
    "large numbers of stars with radial velocities and proper motions ( provided by ucac2 and spm ) will allow us to carry out a new determination of the milky way mass estimate similar to @xcite . when the sloan digital sky survey is complete , color - selected bhb candidates at helio - centric distances up to 75 - 100 kpc will be available to complement the 2mass - selected inner halo sample .",
    "similarly deep color - selected samples of bhb candidates are expected to be available shortly from the galex satellite mission ( rhee , private communication ) .",
    "the combination of the inner - halo sample with mid- and distant - halo samples will provide a definitive map of the distribution of the thick - disk / halo bhb populations of the milky way .",
