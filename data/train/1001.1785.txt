    "classical channels can be uniquely characterized by their capacity @xcite .",
    "the situation in the quantum realm is significantly more involved , with various capacities required to characterize a quantum channel @xcite .",
    "studies of quantum channel capacities can be broadly divided into those considering memoryless quantum channels , for which the output at a given time depends only upon the corresponding input and not upon any previous inputs @xcite , and quantum memory channels , where successive uses of the channel modify its properties and description @xcite .",
    "another important distinction is between channels generated by markovian _ vs_. non - markovian environments or baths .",
    "markovian channels describe memoryless baths , while for non - markovian channels bath memory plays a role @xcite .",
    "many quantum optical @xcite and nuclear magnetic resonance systems @xcite are accurately described by markovian channels , but the markovian limit is always an approximation @xcite . non - markovian effects are especially important in condensed matter systems , such as coupled electron or nuclear spins @xcite .",
    "the master equations describing the dynamics of non - markovian systems are often ( though not always @xcite ) complicated integro - differential equations which are rarely exactly solvable @xcite .",
    "a channel can be memoryless yet non - markovian .",
    "this situation arises when successive uses do not modify the channel , but a proper description of each use of the channel requires a non - markovian treatment accounting for bath memory effects . in this work we investigate how non - markovian effects modify channel capacities by studying an exactly solvable model of a non - markovian memoryless channel : the ising spin - star system @xcite .",
    "one reason to consider spin systems is that they are good candidates for the physical realization of quantum computation and communication , in part due to their relatively long relaxation and decoherence times @xcite .",
    "spin chains have attracted much recent interest as quantum communication channels @xcite .",
    "capacities of a spin chain with ferromagnetic heisenberg interactions were calculated by studying the qubit amplitude damping channel @xcite , and its successive use without resetting ( quantum memory channel ) was investigated for quantum and classical communication @xcite .",
    "different flavors of the spin - star system , with both diagonal and non - diagonal coupling , have been used to study topics such as entanglement distribution @xcite , the dynamics of entanglement of two central spins @xcite , and analytically solvable models of decoherence @xcite .",
    "however , spin - star systems are so far unexplored for quantum transmission of information , and this is our goal in the present paper .",
    "the system qubit in our communication model is represented by a spin located at the center of the star .",
    "it interacts with all non - central spins , comprising the environment , via ising couplings .",
    "this provides a non - markovian quantum dephasing channel whose dynamics can be solved exactly @xcite .",
