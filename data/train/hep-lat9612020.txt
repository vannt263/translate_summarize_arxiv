    "the understanding of the thermodynamics of hadronic matter is a major goal of lattice qcd . in particular",
    ", one would like to find and understand the nature of the transition from hadronic matter to a quark - gluon plasma and to determine the properties of this plasma phase which serve to distinguish it from the hadronic phase .",
    "such high temperature matter must surely have existed in the early universe , and its properties would have helped determine the evolution of the universe .",
    "in addition , it is believed that heavy - ion collisions such as will be observed at rhic will produce hot nuclear / hadronic matter and probably quark - gluon plasma .",
    "finally , such studies can help us understand the dynamics of qcd including confinement and chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "we have carried out simulations of qcd with 2 flavours of light staggered quarks on a @xmath0 lattice . in the first paper in this series we described simulations with quark mass @xmath4 , in lattice units @xcite . in the current paper we describe simulations with quark mass @xmath1 and , where possible , attempt to extrapolate to the chiral limit .",
    "prior results of this study were reported at lattice conferences @xcite , and there has also been a report from the columbia group on their work with a lighter quark mass , @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the simulations were performed on the connection machine ( cm-2 ) at the pittsburgh supercomputing center .",
    "we used the hybrid molecular dynamics algorithm with noisy fermions for our simulations enabling us to tune the number of quark flavours to 2 .",
    "as at the higher mass , we found no evidence for a first - order transition , in agreement with work on lattices with @xmath6 @xcite , @xmath7 @xcite , and @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this is what was predicted on the basis of chiral spin models , which predict a second - order transition at @xmath9 and a rapid crossover , with no transition at small @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the position of the transition was determined by measuring the wilson / polyakov line , which is associated with confinement , and the chiral condensate , @xmath11 , which measures chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "in addition , we have calculated the entropy densities of both quarks and gluons , and measured the topological susceptibility . from the correlation functions of spatial and temporal wilson lines ,",
    "we have estimated the string tensions and debye screening lengths , and addressed the question of @xmath12 production . by measuring the baryon number susceptibility ,",
    "we have determined how the system responds to a finite chemical potential for baryon number .",
    "additionally , we have measured the hadronic screening lengths for light hadronic excitations .",
    "these should give us an indication as to whether the plasma has any hadron - like excitations or whether its excitations are simply quarks and gluons .",
    "finally , we have added valence `` strange '' quarks , whose masses are tuned to give the correct kaon masses when combined with @xmath13 or @xmath14 quarks of mass @xmath1 . by measuring the entropy of such strange quarks , we can address the question as to whether the formation of the quark - gluon plasma is characterized by increased kaon production .",
    "we have also measured the kaon screening lengths .",
    "section 2 describes the simulations and the extractions of most of the order parameters . in section 3",
    "we discuss debye and hadronic screening lengths .",
    "finally , in section 4 we present further discussions and conclusions .",
    "these simulations were performed on a @xmath0 lattice with 2 flavours of light quarks with mass @xmath1 , which will be compared , when appropriate , with earlier simulations with @xmath4 @xcite .",

    "configurations were saved every 20 time units at @xmath16 , every 10 time units at @xmath17 , and every 5 time units for each of the other couplings .",
    "these configurations were used for later analyses .",

    "[ fig : hadron]c indicates that the @xmath127 and @xmath128 ( negative parity nucleon ) become degenerate at ( or near ) the transition which is also evidence that chiral @xmath115 symmetry is restored .",

    "our study of hadron screening lengths indicates that the @xmath121 , @xmath136 and @xmath124 states remain strongly bound above the transition .",
    "thus there are excitations with these quantum numbers ( and presumably those of the @xmath122 ) , in the quark - gluon plasma .",

    "the other hadronic excitations we observed ( @xmath92 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 ) appear to be only weakly bound above the transition .",
    "the relatively large separation of the @xmath121 and @xmath124 masses above the transition compared with that of the @xmath92 and @xmath126 suggests that these do not become degenerate at the transition , so that the restored symmetry above the transition is @xmath137 rather than @xmath119 as some have suggested .",
    "this is in agreement with recent calculations of the chiral susceptibility @xmath68 , and calculations of the @xmath122 mass from the full ( connected + disconnected ) propagator .",
    "our calculation of the baryon number susceptibility , gives us a glimpse of physics at finite baryon number density .",
    "calculation of topological susceptibility at this low mass appears to be strongly affected by the large lattice spacing at @xmath88 , preventing us from reliably extracting its mass dependence .    for the standard wilson action which we used ,",
    "we need a larger value of @xmath138 to remove finite lattice spacing effects .",
    "we also need a larger aspect ratio ( @xmath139 ) to make finite lattice size correction factors closer to one , reducing the systematic uncertainties in extracting entropy densities , energy densities and pressures .",
    "the larger @xmath140 is also needed to reduce the systematic errors involved in extracting screening lengths .",
    "zero temperature values of the plaquette observable and @xmath11 are needed to extract partial pressures and energy densities .",
    "measurements closer together in @xmath46 will be necessary if we are to extract the fluctuation quantities involved in obtaining the equation of state .",
    "the computations were carried out on the connection machine cm2 at the pittsburgh supercomputer center , under an nsf grand challenge allocation . this work was supported by the u.  s. department of energy under contract w-31 - 109-eng-38 , and grants de - fg02 - 91er-40661 , de - fg05 - 92er-40742 , de - fg05 - 85er250000 , de - fg03 - 95er-40906 , and the national science foundation under grants nsf - phy9116964 , nsf - phy-9503371 , nsf - phy92 - 00148 .",
