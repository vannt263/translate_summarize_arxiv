    "resistivity of materials around us ranges by more than 30 orders of magnitude , from @xmath0 to @xmath1 ohmm .",
    "the variety of materials are classified as metals ( m ) and insulators ( i ) , which are two distinct classes of matter only in the @xmath2 limit .",
    "the principle difference between the two classes is in the character of the electronic wavefunctions , which are spatially localized in insulators and extended in metals .",
    "it is well - known , that subjected to even insignificant changes of pressure , dopant density , etc .",
    "many materials exhibit transformations between the two states @xcite .",
    "the m - i transitions ( mit ) , unrelated to changes in the lattice structure and symmetry , are of a special interest because they are considered to be continuous quantum phase transitions , occurring at @xmath3 .",
    "the m - i transitions usually take place as density of electrons decreases ; the latter necessarily leads to the increase of the effective strength of @xmath4 interaction .",
    "a dimensionless ratio @xmath5 of the potential ( coulomb ) energy to kinetic ( fermi ) energy is often used to quantify interaction in 2d , @xmath6 with @xmath7 being the electron density @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the decrease in the density is accompanied with the increase in the effective disorder , particularly , due to the weakening of the screening of potential fluctuations .",
    "thus , both , interactions and disorder are important in the vicinity of the mit ; the separation and interpretation of their effects represents a hard task @xcite .    in the limit of strong interactions",
    "@xmath8 and zero disorder , the groundstate of the 2d system is believed to be the wigner crystal ( wc ) of electrons .",
    "correspondingly , at zero temperature and zero disorder , for 2d system , there is at least one critical point on the interaction axes , quantum melting of the wigner crystal @xcite .",
    "a weak disorder is expected to stabilize the wc . as disorder increases further , wc looses long - range order and crosses over to a localized phase .",
    "thus , in the limit of strong disorder and weak interactions , the ground state of the system is built of the single - particle localized states .",
    "the experiments always take place at non - zero disorder and temperature .",
    "the subject of this paper is related to phenomena which occur due to the combined action of strong inter - electron interactions and disorder .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : sections 1 and 2 introduce a reader to the field and briefly review the main results in the semiclassical and quantum frameworks , correspondingly",
    ". section 3 describes major results on transport in 2d systems , which are discussed in terms of the apparent metal - insulator transition in 2d .",
    "section 4 describes quantitative studies of the effects of electron - electron interaction ; the experimental results are compared with available theories in various regimes .    .",
    "+ at finite temperature , or for finite system size @xmath9 , the metal and insulator states are not well - defined ; one can be mislead by attempting to distinguish these two states according to their conduction .",
    "in fact , the two states are inherently related with two distinct types of electron wavefunctions , localized and extended ones .",
    "the latter are classified according to the localization length @xmath10 : if @xmath11 the waves are extended ( metal ) and @xmath12 ; if @xmath13 the waves are localized ( insulator ) and @xmath14 . note , the electron spacing , ( @xmath15  ( the valley degeneracy @xmath16 corresponds to ( 100)si - crystal plane ) .",
    "for the extended states , when @xmath17 ( with @xmath18 being the mean free path ) the electron motion results in a classical drude conduction @xmath19 . as disorder increases , @xmath18 decreases .",

    "+ the 2d electron and hole systems discussed in this lecture consist of the bulk carriers confined in a two - dimensional potential well ; the latter is formed at the interface between two semiconductors or semiconductor / insulator interface .",
    "figure 2 schematically shows crossview of the silicon metal - oxide - semiconductor ( mos ) stucture @xcite .",
    "the 2d layer of electrons is confined at the interface between si and sio@xmath25 , grown at the top of the si - substrate . on the top of the insulating layer , a thin metallic film ( gate )",
    "is deposited . throughout this lecture ,",
    "the electrons and holes are the same quasiparticles and for simplicity will be often called `` electrons '' .    when the positive voltage @xmath26 is applied to the gate ( relative to the source , or drain contact , or relative to the si - bulk ) , the conduction @xmath27 and valence @xmath28 band edges bend down as figure [ energy band_si - mos ] shows . for a sufficiently high gate voltage , the bottom of the conduction band decreases below the bulk fermi level and the resulting triangular potential well starts populating with electrons @xcite . at room temperatures , when the bulk si is conducting , redistribution of the electrons between the bulk and the 2d layer",
    "occurs in accord with the poisson equation @xcite .",
    "when the gate voltage is applied or changed at low temperatures , the bulk conduction is frozen - out , the equilibrium with bulk is not achieved , and the required electrons come into ( or out ) the 2d layer from the potential contacts . the contacts are lithographically defined dopant diffusion areas with high concentration of electrons supplied by the dopants .",

    "+ there are two regimes of the metallic - like transport : diffusive for @xmath36 , and ballistic regime for @xmath37 .",
    "the phase breaking length @xmath38 ( with @xmath39 , the phase breaking time , @xmath40 - diffusion coefficient ) is related with large changes of electron energy and is similar ( not equivalent though ) to inelastic length .",
    "the relevant scattering processes for @xmath39 at high temperatures are ( i ) electron - phonon scattering , and for low temperatures - ( ii ) electron - impurity and ( iii ) electron - electron scattering . in general , @xmath41 with @xmath42 , depending on the dominating scattering process .",
    "since electron - electron collisions conserve the total momentum , the transport time @xmath43 ( momentum relaxation ) is determined by the two former processes and is insensitive to electron - electron scattering .    .",
    "+ if an energy barrier @xmath44 separates the energy of the electron states from conduction ( or valence ) band , and the wavefunctions of localized states do nt overlap , the conduction occurs via temperature activated transitions whose probability is @xmath45 .",
    "when the probability of the temperature activation is too low ( e.g. , for high @xmath44 , or for low temperatures ) , transport occurs via elastic tunneling between the localized states .",
    "this is the so - called hopping conduction regime , where the characteristic temperature dependence of the conductivity is @xmath46 , where @xmath47 or 1/3 , depending on a specific model .",
    "usually , hopping conduction dominates at low temperatures .",
    "+ in the quantum - mechanical picture , the electron waves propagate and interfere .",

    "the single - particle interference thus may be viewed as a quantum `` backscattering '' .",

    "@xcite , it was suggested that transport in the critical regime is driven not only by `` universal '' effects of interactions among the itinerant electrons , but also by interactions of itinerant electrons with localized ones , the latter issue ( short - range aspect of interactions ) is missing in most of the existing theories .",

    "the behavior of the renormalized spin susceptibility and effective mass for 2d holes at high @xmath5 values remains puzzling ; the reason of the discrepancy between the 2d hole and electron systems is not clear .",
