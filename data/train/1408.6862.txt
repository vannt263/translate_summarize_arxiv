    "cooperative phenomena in magnetic systems are often investigated within some approximation methods in statistical physics .",
    "there are still a few exact results in the literature @xcite , since the partition function is not tractable in most of the systems .",
    "the most known example of this situation is that there is still no exact result for the most basic model of magnetic systems , namely ising model @xcite in three dimensions , although exact result for two dimensional system has been presented in 1944 @xcite .",
    "there are numerous approximation and simulation methods for these systems .",
    "each of these methods have their own advantages as well as disadvantages .",
    "a class of these approximation methods is called effective field theories ( eft ) @xcite .",
    "recent developments in these formulations , especially in correlated effective theories can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "early attempts to solve ising model yields mean field theories ( mft ) , which reduce the many particle hamiltonian into one particle , with replacing the spin operators in the hamiltonian with their thermal ( or ensemble ) averages .",
    "this means that neglecting all self - spin and multi - spin correlations in the system .",
    "after than , by handling the self - spin correlations , eft formulations have been constructed .",
    "first successful variants of these approximations are oguchi approximation @xcite and bethe - peierls approximation ( bpa ) @xcite . after than , many variants of the eft constructed with their own advantages , disadvantages and own limitations @xcite .",
    "most of the eft formulations start by constructing a finite cluster within the system .",
    "interactions between the spins which are located in this cluster are written exactly as much as possible and the coupling of this cluster with the outside of it is written approximately .",
    "the problem arises when we work with finite clusters which represent the whole system .",
    "let us call the spins located in the chosen cluster as inner spins , spins located at the borders of the chosen finite cluster as border spins and all other spins as outer spins , i.e. outer spin is any spin which is outside of the chosen cluster .",
    "the interactions between the inner spins with other inner spins or border spins can be calculated with a given hamiltonian of the system .",
    "the problem comes from the interactions of the border spins with their nearest neighbor outer spins .",
    "these interactions have to take into account an approximate way . in a typical mft for these systems",
    ", this approximation can be made via replacing all these nearest neighbor outer spin operators with their thermal ( or ensemble ) average .",
    "although in the spirit of the mean field approximation , reducing the many particle system to the one particle system , we may call aforementioned approximation for n - spin cluster as mft-@xmath0 .    on",
    "the other hand eft can include the self - spin correlations in the formulation .",
    "then , it is superior to the mft .",
    "one class of the eft for the ising model start with a single - site kinematic relations , which gives the magnetization of the system , such as callen identity @xcite or suzuki identity @xcite .",
    "although these types of identities are exact , since they are in a transcendental form , calculation with these identities requires some approximations .",
    "most widely used method here is differential operator technique @xcite . neglecting the multi - spin correlations within this method , namely using decoupling approximation ( da )",
    "@xcite , it gives the results of the zernike approximation @xcite . in order to reduce that transcendental function given in the callen identity to a polynomial form ,",
    "there are also combinatorial techniques @xcite , integral operator technique @xcite and probability distribution technique @xcite .    on the other hand , larger clusters for obtaining critical properties of the ising model for several lattices have been used . for instance , @xmath1-spin cluster ( eft-@xmath1 ) @xcite and @xmath2-spin cluster ( eft-@xmath2 )",
    "@xcite have been successfully applied to the ising systems .",
    "but , to the best of our knowledge , there is no general formulation for eft-@xmath0 given . besides , working with larger clusters is important for obtaining the critical temperature of the system within the renormalization group technique , which are within the mean field renormalization group ( mfrg ) @xcite and effective field renormalization group ( efrg ) @xcite techniques for the ising model . using larger clusters give more closer critical temperatures to the exact ones .",
    "for instance clusters up to number of 6 spins for the honeycomb lattice , number of 9 spins for the square lattice and 8 spins for the simple cubic lattice have been used within the efrg and more accurate critical temperatures has been obtained @xcite .    as seen in this brief literature , working with larger clusters are important for obtaining more accurate results for the critical and thermodynamical properties of the ising model . since enlarging the cluster comes with some computational cost ,",
    "it is important to answer the question : how large is it enough ?",
    "besides , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , for the heisenberg model in nano materials , it is not an arbitrary choice to use larger clusters , but it is necessity in some of the systems .",
    "this point will be discussed again in later sections . in the light of these points ,",
    "the aim of this work is to construct a general eft-@xmath0 formulation for arbitrary lattice and compare the results of the solutions in different sized clusters and exact ones .",
    "for this aim , the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "but since the mft-@xmath0 curves starts with higher values than the eft-@xmath0 curves ( i.e. the values of the @xmath138 parameters of the mft-@xmath0 is higher than the eft-@xmath0 ) , eft-@xmath0 curves reach more quickly to the level of bpa .",
    "but the higher rate of decrease of the curves mft-@xmath0 results to reaching the infinitely close to the exact results before the curves of eft-@xmath0 .",

    "( [ denk47 ] ) , for the honeycomb ( @xmath139 ) , square ( @xmath140 ) and simple cubic ( @xmath141 ) lattices . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as explained above , enlarging the cluster yields more accurate results for the critical temperatures .",
    "but on some problems we have to use larger clusters , even though we do not need the more accurate results .",
    "both of the approximations in @xmath41-spin cluster can not distinguish of some different lattice types .",
    "most trivial example is eft-@xmath41 formulation can not distinguish the simple cubic lattice from the triangular lattice , since both of the lattices have coordination number ( number of nearest neighbors ) 6 and eft-@xmath41 uses only the coordination numbers .",
    "this deficiency may yield some dramatic results . in order to explain this point ,",
    "suppose that we have a magnetic system with a geometry given as fig .",
    "( [ sek4 ] ) .",
    "system is infinitely long about the @xmath5 axis and finite in @xmath142 plane . with this geometry we can model the single walled nanotube . in this form there are number of 6 spins in each plane . beside the present interaction between this",
    "nearest neighbor spins in one plane , also there are interactions with nearest neighbor spins in the lower and upper planes .",
    "let us call @xmath143 as the size of the nanotube , which is the number of spins in each @xmath142 plane .",
    "while in fig .",
    "( [ sek4 ] ) the size of the nanotube is 6 , there can exist bigger or lower sizes .",
    "for instance @xmath144 is a three - leg spin tube @xcite .",
    "regardless of the size of the nanotube , if we solve this system with eft-@xmath41 , we obtain the results of the square lattice . because of eq .",
    "( [ denk26 ] ) ( or eq .",
    "( [ denk30 ] ) ) contains only the coordination number as a representation of the geometry of the system",
    ". then we have to enlarge the cluster .",
    "one of the reasonable choice is to construct a finite cluster from the @xmath145 spins , which are in the same plane .",
    "we can see the results for the critical temperatures for this system in fig .",
    "( [ sek5 ] ) . constructed cluster sizes and the size of the nanotube are the same , i.e. results taken from the @xmath145-spin cluster , where the cluster consists of the spins that belong to the one plane of the system .",
    "mfa-@xmath41 and eft-@xmath41 results have been shown by horizontal lines in fig .",
    "( [ sek5 ] ) with the values @xmath146 and , @xmath147 respectively .",
    "as seen in fig .",
    "( [ sek5 ] ) , critical temperature rises when the size of the nanotube gets bigger , as physically expected .",
    "but as seen in fig .",
    "( [ sek5 ] ) , 1-spin cluster formulations can not give this situation .",
    "lastly , efrg calculations on s-1/2 ising systems can be easily done by using eq .",
    "( [ denk47 ] ) . as an example of this , we have depicted the variation of the critical temperature of the square lattice ( obtained within the efrg formulation ) with some selected cluster sizes in fig .",
    "[ sek6 ] . as seen in fig .",
    "[ sek6 ] that , critical temperatures obtained from both of the methods ( namely , efrg and mfrg ) approach to the exact result , while the size of the clusters rise .",
    "results for mfrg-@xmath148 ( @xmath149 ) , efrg-@xmath148 ( @xmath150 ) are the same as given in refs . @xcite and @xcite , respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "the results of efrg-@xmath151 ( @xmath152 ) and efrg-@xmath153 ( @xmath154 ) are lower than the obtained value of efrg-@xmath155 ( @xmath156 ) in ref . @xcite .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , these last two results have not been obtained within the efrg yet .      in this section",
    "we want to investigate the effect of the enlarging the cluster on the thermodynamic properties of the system .",
    "since different lattices have similar behaviors then we restrict ourselves in only square lattice .",
    "magnetization can be calculated from eq .",
    "( [ denk44 ] ) as explained in sec .",
    "[ formulation ] .",
    "the differentiation of eq .",
    "( [ denk44 ] ) with respect to magnetic field will give the magnetic susceptibility ( @xmath157 ) of the system .",
    "besides , internal energy of the system ( denoted as @xmath158 , which is scaled by @xmath7 ) can be calculated as the same way of magnetization .",
    "the only difference is the starting point of the calculation i.e. in eq .",
    "( [ denk8 ] ) , instead of @xmath28 there will be terms like @xmath159 which are the nearest neighbors of the chosen cluster .",
    "again , differentiation of this expression with respect to the temperature will give the specific heat ( denoted by @xmath160 , which is again scaled by @xmath7 ) .    in order to see the effect of the enlarging cluster within the eft-@xmath0 formulation , we depict the variation of the magnetization and the magnetic susceptibility of the system at zero magnetic field , with the temperature for different cluster sizes in fig .",
    "[ sek7 ] . as seen in fig .",
    "[ sek7 ] ( a ) the magnetization behaviors with the temperature are the same for all of the clusters .",
    "the only difference comes from the critical temperature , in which the magnetization reaches to value of zero . as the size of the cluster increases , the critical temperature decreases , as shown also in fig .",
    "[ sek2 ] ( b ) .",
    "this decreasing behavior of the critical temperature shows itself also in the behavior of the magnetic susceptibility . as seen in fig .",
    "[ sek7 ] ( b ) , while the size of the cluster increases , the peaks of the susceptibility curves grow as well as they shift to the right of the @xmath161 plane , i.e. lower temperature regions .",
    "as we can see from [ sek7 ] ( b ) that , enlarging cluster gives more realistic results for the magnetic susceptibility , since the divergence behavior of the magnetic susceptibility at a critical temperature appears more strongly as the size of the cluster rises .",
    "we can make similar conclusions about the behavior of the internal energy and the specific heat of the system , when the size of the cluster rises within the eft-@xmath0 formulation .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "[ sek8 ] ( a ) that , the change in the behavior of the internal energy with temperature , occurs at lower values of the temperature as the cluster size rises , since enlarging cluster causes to decline of the critical temperature .",
    "the same thing shows itself in fig .",
    "[ sek8 ] ( b ) also , which is the variation of the specific heat with the temperature for some selected values of the cluster sizes .",
    "the peaks , which occurs at the critical temperature , getting higher when the cluster size rises .",
    "all these comments suggest that , within the eft-@xmath0 formulation , enlarging the cluster also will give more realistic results in the thermodynamic properties of the system . as in the effect of the enlarging cluster on the critical temperatures of the system , while rising the size of the cluster , the difference between the successive curves getting smaller .",
    "in conclusion , a general formulation for the eft with differential operator technique and da ( as well as mft ) with larger finite clusters has been derived . enlarging the finite cluster yields different formulations which are called eft-@xmath0 ( or mft-@xmath0 ) for the @xmath0-spin cluster .",
    "the formulation is limited to the s-1/2 ising model on completely translationally invariant lattices .",
    "it has been shown that , application of the eft-@xmath0 and mft-@xmath0 formulations on several lattices yield more accurate results in critical temperatures as well as the thermodynamic properties of the system , when the size of the cluster rises",
    ". comparisons of the results in the critical temperatures have been made with the results of the bpa and exact ones .",
    "it has been shown that eft-@xmath136 and mft-@xmath135 results and eft-@xmath162 and mft-@xmath163 results in the critical temperature , gives the results of the bpa for the square and simple cubic lattices , respectively .",
    "we note here that , constructing process of the finite cluster with @xmath0 spins can be made in several ways .",
    "different geometrical clusters which have the same number of spins will give different results .",
    "besides , the limitations of the derived formulation have been discussed , since enlarging the cluster yield more and more numerical computations , and then takes more and more time .",
    "anyway , we can say that the formulation derived in this work can be applied to any cluster size , in principle .    besides all of these , derived formulation can be used in efrg ( and mfrg ) formulations .",
    "the effect of the enlarging cluster on the critical temperatures of the square lattice within efrg formulation has been also discussed , with applying the formulation .",
    "the simplest possible mfrg formulation gives the results of the bpa in the critical temperature , while the efrg results lie always below of the mfrg results , as expected .",
    "in addition to all of these observations , necessity of the using @xmath0-spin cluster formulations in some systems ( such as nano magnetic systems ) has been discussed . constructing eft-@xmath0 formulation for the magnetic nano materials will be the topic of the future work .",
