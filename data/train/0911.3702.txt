    "recent astrophysical data from distant ia supernovae observations @xcite,@xcite show that the current universe is not only expanding , it is accelerating due to some kind of negative - pressure form of matter called dark energy .",
    "this dark energy may consist of cosmological constant , conventionally associated with the energy of the vacuum or alternatively , could came from a dynamical varying scalar field at late times which also account for the missing energy density in the universe .",
    "that kind of scalar fields are allowed from several theories in particle physics and in multidimensional gravity , like kaluza - klein theory , string theory@xcite or supergravity , in which the scalar field appears in a natural way .",
    "the cosmological solutions using scalar fields have been a subject of intensive study in the last years in the usual model called quintessence @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , where the stability of scaling solutions was studied ( i.e. solutions where the scalar energy density scale in the same way like a barotropic fluid ) for a field evolving in accordance with an exponential potential and a power law potential , which provide a late time inflation .",
    "more exotic approaches to the problem of dark energy using scalar fields are related with k - essence models , based on scalar field with non - standard kinetic term @xcite,@xcite ; string theory fundamental scalars known as tachyons @xcite ; scalar field with negative kinetic energy , which provides a solution known as phantom dark energy @xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the non - minimal coupling between the quintessence field and curvature , as an explanation of the accelerated expansion , has been considered among others , in refs .",
    "@xcite @xcite,@xcite .",
    "this coupling has also been studied in the context of the inflationary cosmology @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "an inflationary model including the dbi term and non - minimally coupled scalar has been proposed in @xcite + in this paper we consider the possibility of an explicit coupling between the scalar field , the kinetic term and the curvature , as a source of dark energy , and analyze the role of this new coupling in an evolution scenario with late - time accelerated expansion .",
    "the basic motivation for studying such theories is related with the fact that they appear as lowenergy limit of several higher dimensional theories , e.g. superstring theory @xcite , and provide a possible approach to quantum gravity from a perturbative point of view .",
    "they appear as part of the weyl anomaly in @xmath0 conformal supergravity @xcite . a model with non - minimal derivative couplings",
    "was proposed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite in the context of inflationary cosmology , and in @xcite a derivative coupling to ricci tensor has been considered to study cosmological restrictions on the coupling parameter , and the role of this coupling during inflation .",
    "some asymptotical solutions for a non - minimal kinetic coupling to scalar and ricci curvatures were found in @xcite .",
    "non - minimal coupling of arbitrary function @xmath1 with matter lagrangian ( including the kinetic scalar term ) has been introduced in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "such a model was proposed to describe the dark energy , late - time universe acceleration . when @xmath1 represents the power law function , such a model ( which maybe considered as string - inspired theory ) maybe proposed for dynamical resolution of cosmological constant problem as it has been suggested in @xcite,@xcite . in the present work we consider this function @xmath1 as linear in @xmath2",
    "but we generalize the model permitting extra @xmath3 coupling with kinetic - like scalar term .",
    "in addition , we keep the free kinetic term for scalar . + we propose a model of dark energy in which the scalar - field kinetic term is non - minimally coupled to itself and to the scalar and ricci curvatures .",
    "the considered self coupling have the advantage of leaving the coupling constants without dimension . some asymptotic solutions for the scalar field",
    "are proposed , and the scalar - field potential is found .",
    "the power - law expansion is also considered , and the expressions for the scalar - field and potential are found . in the last section we present some conclusions .",
    "let us start with the following action :    [ eq1 ]    s=&d^4x+ s_m .    where @xmath4 is the dark matter action which describes a fluid with barotropic equation of state .",
    "the presence of the @xmath5 coefficient in each interacting term , guarantees that the coupling constants @xmath6 and @xmath7 are dimensionless . taking the variation of action [ eq1 ] with respect to the metric , we obtain a general expression of the form [ eq2 ] r_-g_r=^2where @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the usual energy - momentum tensor for matter component , and the tensor @xmath10 represents the variation of the terms which depend on the scalar field @xmath11 and can be written as [ eq3 ] t_=t_^+t_^+t_^ where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 correspond to the variations of the minimally coupled terms , the @xmath6 and the @xmath7 couplings respectively .",

    "we consider that in action ( [ eq1 ] ) matter is universally coupled only to @xmath15 , and thus all experimental data will have their usual interpretation in this frame .",
    "variating with respect to the scalar field gives rise to the equation of motion [ eq7 ]    & -_+- + & ( r_^+r_^^)=0    assuming the spatially - flat friedmannrobertsonwalker ( frw ) metric , [ eq8 ] ds^2=-dt^2+a(t)^2(dr^2+r^2d^2 ) using ( [ eq4]-[eq6 ] ) ,",
    "we can write the @xmath16 and @xmath17 components of the tensor @xmath10 ( with the hubble parameter @xmath18 and for homogeneous time - depending scalar field ) as follows [ eq9 ]    t_00=&^2+v()+3 + + & 3    and [ eq10 ]    = & ^2-v()++ + &    which can be interpreted as the effective density and pressure respectively . the equation of motion [ eq7 ] takes the form [ eq11 ]    & + 3h++3(4+)h^2(-)+3(2+)(- ) + & + 9(4+)h^3 + 3(14 + 5)h+3(2+)=0    where the first three terms correspond to the minimally coupled scalar field .",
