    "recent advances in numerical relativity are expanding the dynamical range covered by non - linear , three - dimensional simulations of general relativistic systems .",
    "however , we are still far from having evolutions that successfully simulate a binary black - hole system starting from the in - spiral of the holes , continuing through their merger and ending in the ring - down of the resulting single black hole .",
    "the obstacles defining this challenge are multiple and not all understood or even known .",
    "for example , it has become increasingly evident that the form of the einstein equations implemented in numerical codes is one of the important aspects determining the behavior of the simulations . in principle",
    ", there are an infinite number of ways to recast the einstein equations as a cauchy problem .",
    "the search for the formulation or family of formulations that will lead to long - lived evolutions has , in some situations , become a tour - de - force . in spite of the many",
    " 3 + 1 flavors \" of the einstein equations so far introduced , there has not been a formulation exhibiting a clear superiority .    besides the form of the evolution equations ,",
    "there are other essential ingredients that have been demonstrated to yield improvements in the duration of the simulations .",
    "gauge or coordinate conditions , methods to handle the singularities , non - reflective boundary conditions and discretization methods are some examples of these elements @xcite .",
    "another major focus in numerical relativity has been producing long - lasting , three - dimensional evolutions of the simplest case of a space - time containing black - hole singularities , namely that of a single , excised black hole in which the location of the black hole remains fixed on the computational grid @xcite .",
    "it is safe to say that this milestone has been achieved @xcite .",
    "one should keep in mind , however , that some of the elements used to obtain simulations lasting forever can not be extended or applied to binary black - hole orbits and coalescences . specifically , the elements in question , as we will later discuss in detail , are those that hinge on keeping fixed the coordinate location of the black - hole singularities and thus the excision boundary .    for sufficiently large separations , even in the non - linear regime",
    ", it should be possible to construct an approximate co - rotating coordinate system in which the coordinate drift of the black holes is avoided via an appropriate set of gauge or coordinate conditions @xcite .",
    "however , once a given co - rotating frame can no longer keep the location of the black holes fixed without introducing extreme grid stretching , construction of a new co - rotating frame will be needed .",
    "it is then likely that in this new co - rotating frame , the coordinate location of the black holes , and therefore the excision regions , will be different .",
    "consequently , there is a natural need to develop an excision algorithm that is able to accommodate motion of the black holes .",
    "this implies handling , among other things , grid points that emerge from inside of the excised regions and become part of the computational domain .",
    "there are examples of simulations with moving excision already in the literature . using a characteristic formulation , long - lasting evolutions of a wobbling black hole",
    "have been obtained @xcite .",
    "other examples of simulations involving motion of the excision boundary include boosted , single black holes @xcite and grazing collisions @xcite .",
    "recently , yo , baumgarte and shapiro @xcite presented a simple scheme for a moving excision boundary when solving the scalar field equation in the background of a boosted black hole .",
    "the objective of this paper is to enhance the excision algorithm used in long - term stable simulations of single non - moving black holes to handle the case of moving black holes .",
    "our approach can be viewed as an extension of the work in ref .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : the formulation of the einstein equations and the method used in our code , called maya , to solve these equations are summarized in ",

    "when viewed as a cauchy problem , the einstein equations provide a mechanism to construct the time - history of the geometry of three - dimensional space - like hypersurfaces .",
    "the geometry of each hypersurface is characterized by the intrinsic metric @xmath0 and extrinsic curvature @xmath1 .",
    "the space - time foliation is glued together with the help of the lapse function @xmath2 and the shift vector @xmath3 . in principle",
    ", the problem reduces to finding @xmath0 and @xmath1 for all the hypersurfaces by solving the einstein equations written explicitly in terms of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , namely the einstein equations in a 3 + 1 form .",
    "an example of these equations are the adm equations @xcite .",
    "however , evolutions obtained with the adm equations have had very limited success . nakamura and shibata @xcite , and later baumgarte and shapiro @xcite , introduced a formulation ( bssn ) of the einstein equations that has clearly yielded remarkable improvements . instead of @xmath0 and @xmath1 as primary variables ,",
    "the bssn formulation introduces new variables @xmath4 and @xmath5 . the relationships between the bssn and adm variables are : @xmath6 where @xmath7 . above , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : phi ] ) and ( [ eq : ghat ] ) imply that the conformal metric @xmath8 has unit determinant , which in turn yields the second equality in eq .",

    "this modification is crucial to achieve stability in single , non - moving black - hole simulations . finally , the first terms in the r.h.s .",
    "( [ eq : phidot]-[eq : gammadot ] ) involving @xmath15 denote lie derivatives of the scalar @xmath16 and tensor densities @xmath8 and @xmath11 , as well as their extension to quantities related to tensor densities , such as @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we have developed a numerical code , called maya , to solve eqs .",
    "( [ eq : phidot]-[eq : gammadot ] ) .",
    "the code views this system of equations as having the following structure : @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",

    "are approximated using second - order , centered finite differencing .",
    "the terms of the form @xmath25 are commonly called  advection \" terms .",
    "they are approximate via a second order or higher upwind differencing ; for details , see ref .",
    "@xcite .    at the outer boundary ,",
    "the traditional approach for bssn - based evolutions has been to assume that @xmath26 where @xmath27 represents an analytic solution . for the case of single black holes ,",
    "this analytic solution is the exact solution to the einstein equations .",
    "if an exact solution is not available , the flat space - time solution is used provided the outer boundary is sufficiently far away from the holes .",
    "( [ eq : outcond ] ) is then implemented in a differential form , namely @xmath28 the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ eq : radcond ] ) is discretized as in the advection term in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : phidot]-[eq : gammadot ] ) .",
    "it was found @xcite that in order to achieve stability for single , non - moving black - hole evolutions , condition ( [ eq : radcond ] ) should not be used for the connection @xmath5 . for this field ,",
    "one needs instead to impose @xmath29 .",
    "notice that in deriving eq .",
    "( [ eq : radcond ] ) , it was assumed that the analytic solution is time - independent",
    ". this will not be the case for the moving black hole in our tests . for simplicity ,",
    "we have chosen instead to directly use the dirichlet condition @xmath30 .",
    "this will turn out to be one of the two factors limiting the duration of the simulations .    at the excision boundary",
    ", the discretization of spatial derivatives also requires special treatment .",
    "this constitutes the focus of the paper and is addressed in detail in the following section .    once all spatial operators in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mol ] ) are discretized , @xmath31 is updated using a second - order , iterative crank - nicholson scheme @xcite .",
    "parallelization , io and parameter manipulations in the maya code are handled via the cactus toolkit developed by the albert einstein institute in golm , germany @xcite .",
    "finally , several studies have shown @xcite that stable evolutions of single black holes are not possible if both the lapse function and shift vector are analytic functions from the exact solutions .",
    "instead , one needs ",
    "driver \" gauge conditions such as the @xmath32 condition for @xmath2 or the @xmath33-driver for @xmath3 ; for a review of gauge conditions , see ref .",
    "unfortunately , these driver - gauge conditions have been designed having in mind time - independent solutions .",
    "these gauge conditions will not be applicable for the excision tests of a moving black hole under our consideration .",
    "we are then limited to using the exact solution to specify @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "here resides the second factor limiting the duration of our simulations .",
    "from causality considerations , one argues that it is completely unnecessary to evolve the system of equations inside the event horizon of a black hole  no physically meaningful information can possibly propagate out to affect the space - time outside the horizon .",
    "doing so has the desirable effect of removing the black - hole singularity from the computational domain . if one chooses to ignore , or excise , the interior of a black hole , the immediate problem one must face is that of finding its event horizon .",
    "the event horizon , however , is a global object requiring a complete knowledge of the space - time , namely the solution to the problem itself .",
    "unruh @xcite suggested using instead the apparent horizon .",
    "apparent horizons @xcite are defined in terms of quantities local - in - time .",
    "that is , to find apparent horizons , one only needs the spatial metric @xmath0 and extrinsic curvature @xmath1 of the space - like hypersurfaces in the 3 + 1 foliation .",
    "thus , following the history of apparent horizons naturally adapts to the evolution of the system since only information at a given instant of time is required .",
    "the importance of apparent horizons in connection with excision lies on the fact that an apparent horizon will always be coincident or contained within the event horizon .",
    "therefore , as long as the region that is ignored or excised is bounded by or contained within the apparent horizon , this region will also be interior to the event horizon .",
    "once the interior of an apparent horizon has been removed from the calculation , the next step to address is whether boundary conditions are required at the excision boundary .",
    "if all the fields involved in the calculation have at the excision boundary outgoing characteristics in the direction of the singularity , away from the computational domain , there is no need for imposing boundary conditions . in this case , the fields at the excision boundary are evolved in the same form as the fields in the interior of the computational domain .",
    "the problem in general relativity is that the only characteristics that one can blindly assume to be outgoing at the excision boundary are those of physical modes since only those modes are causally constrained . for other modes , such as gauge modes ,",
    "the characteristics depend on the particular structure of the evolution equations as well as the set of gauge conditions imposed .",
    "manifestly hyperbolic formulations of the einstein equations facilitate determining the characteristics of all the fields , thus allowing the identification of those fields requiring conditions at the excision boundary . here",
    "is one of the main reasons for the popularity of explicitly hyperbolic formulations of the einstein equations @xcite .",
    "this would suggest that numerical simulations involving excision are only possible using a hyperbolic formulation .",
    "however , studies by several groups using the bssn formulation , a formulation that is not explicitly hyperbolic , have shown @xcite that this is not the case .",
    "bssn - based codes , assuming all fields having outgoing characteristics at the excision boundary , have produced results similar to those based on hyperbolic formulations .    in summary , we work under the assumption that there is no need for boundary conditions at the excision boundary .",
    "the only task is to design a discretization of the evolution equations that is appropriate at the excision boundary where centered finite differencing is no longer feasible .",
    "a possible approach to handle spatial derivatives at the excision boundary is to modify all finite - difference stencils at this boundary so as to avoid using grid - points from within the excised region ( _ e.g. _ one - sided differences ) , while still keeping the same order of accuracy .",
    "this typically involves getting lost in a veritable jungle of logic , especially when the excision region is that of the `` lego sphere '' , a representation of a sphere using only the points on a fixed cartesian grid .",
    "each type of corner must be treated with its own finite difference stencil .",
    "this approach was followed in early simulations @xcite . to circumvent the complications of this stencil - modification method , alcubierre and",
    "brgmann @xcite introduced a very simple excision method which is ideally suited for stationary space - times such as those involved with single black - hole evolutions . in @xcite , simulations of single black holes that did not assume any symmetries had limited duration .",
    "it has been recently demonstrated @xcite , however , that the factor restricting the duration of these simulations was not the excision method used , but a term in the evolution equation of the connection @xmath18 .",
    "anticipating that for more general cases , e.g. binary black holes , the excision boundary and the r.h.s .",
    "( [ eq : phidot]-[eq : gammadot ] ) will have strong temporal dependence , we present a method for handling the excision boundary that generalizes to non - stationary space - times .",
    "our approach extends the method used by yo , baumgarte and shapiro in their study of the dynamics of a scalar field in the background of a single , boosted black hole @xcite .",
    "we have carried out tests to show that our method , when applied to the case of a non - moving black hole , reproduces the observed long - term stability observed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "once an apparent horizon is found , the first step is to choose the shape and size of the excision region .",
    "a brief comment is warranted regarding the choice of the shape of the excision region .",
    "historically , a sphere was used .",
    "the rationale for this is that the apparent horizon will tend to be spherical or ellipsoidal in all but extremely dynamical space - times . as mentioned before , on the cartesian grids",
    "typically used in three - dimensional numerics , one achieves only a crude approximation of the sphere , colloquially known as a `` lego sphere '' .",
    "alcubierre and brgmann simplified matters @xcite by using a cube as an excision shape .",
    "we have experimented with a variety of excision shapes , all possessing at the very least octahedral symmetry ( because of the frequent use of octant , quadrant , and equatorial symmetry boundary conditions in performing three - dimensional simulations ) , and in the end , have settled on the sphere , the cube , and the cuboctahedron .",
    "these shapes are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : shapes ] .",
    "the `` idealized '' excision shapes one may wish to use for excision - a cube , a cuboctahedron , and a sphere , along with their representations on a cartesian grid . the commonly - seen `` lego sphere '' at the bottom right is the largest of the three shapes in terms of the volume it encloses.,height=151 ]    to facilitate the excision method , we adopt the common practice of carrying an extra grid function , called the `` mask '' , to indicate the state of a grid - point in the computational domain .",
    "the typical states of a grid - point are : excised , excision boundary , interior , and outer boundary .",

    "our approach for updating data at the excision boundary is designed to avoid altering the finite difference stencils used for the interior points .",
    "this is crucial for preserving a simple code .",
    "it consists of obtaining the data at the excision boundary via polynomial extrapolation . in order to simplify matters even further",
    ", we perform one - dimensional extrapolations along normal directions to the excision boundary . because in general the excision boundary is only a discretized approximation to the geometric shape desired , the normal to the excision boundary is not aligned with the grid - points in the computational domain .",

    "we consider two approaches to construct data at the excision boundary .",
    "one approach involves the extrapolation of @xmath35 from the interior points to the excision boundary ( rhs - extrapolation method ) .",
    "the other approach is based on extrapolation of the solution @xmath37 ( sol - extrapolation method ) .",
    "[ fig : xpol ] shows an illustration of both methods .",

    "this implies rhs - extrapolations of at least second - order .",

    "it is important to notice that the simple excision method first used by @xcite and later by @xcite consists of first - order extrapolation , namely @xmath47 . this choice yields truncation errors of @xmath48 .",
    "our numerical experiments with a moving black hole using zero - order extrapolations quickly became unstable , in agreement with similar results in @xcite .",

    "( [ eq : mol ] ) , the @xmath47 condition is equivalent in the continuum to @xmath49 which is consistent with the time - independent nature of the solution .",
    "the sol - extrapolation method uses the values @xmath50 through @xmath51 to obtain @xmath41 , as depicted by the solid black arrow . in order to preserve second - order accuracy of the solution in this case ,",
    "third - order extrapolations are needed .",

    "we adjust the numerical evolution such that the excision region does not move by more than a grid - point .",
    "the consequences of this change of location are that points previously labeled excision boundary are now interior and points previously labeled excised are now excision boundary .",
    "[ fig : move ] depicts this process .",
    "the movement is indicated by the shift in the apparent horizon ( dark circles ) , which causes the excision region to shift in order to remain centered on the apparent horizon .",

    "the reason why the l2-norm of @xmath80 does not show the jagged behavior is because the l2-norm of @xmath80 was done with data that did not include excision boundary data .",
    "the data were taken from within a shell centered at the location of the black hole a distance @xmath83 from the excision boundary .",
    "the jaggedness in the hamiltonian constraint plots is due to the artificial jump of values because the center of the excision region is forced to be at a grid point , thus producing discontinuous motion of the excision region .",

    "we have generalized and applied the excision algorithm presented in @xcite to the case of a single black hole moving its coordinate location throughout the computational domain .",
    "we showed that this algorithm is generalizable to non - stationary black - hole space - times .",
    "we also find that , despite the fact that a cubical excision region is all that is necessary for long - lived stationary black - hole runs , a spherical excision boundary is viable . a spherical shape may be more desirable in dynamic simulations because it allows the excision region to fit more easily within the apparent horizon .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the algorithm in this work for excising the black hole as it moves through the computational domain behaves in a similar way to excising a stationary black hole .",
    "this suggest that as gauge and boundary conditions suitable for time - dependent solutions are developed , the excision method discussed in this work can be directly implemented without requiring further or with minimal modifications .",
