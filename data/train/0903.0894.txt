    "primordial non - gaussianity is now recognized as a powerful probe of the details of the physics of inflation @xcite , as detection of large primordial non - gaussianity would rule out all classes of inflation models that satisfy the following four conditions simultaneously : single - field , canonical kinetic term , slow - roll , and initially vacuum state .",
