    "the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite , which consists only of fermions , is still important as a model of dynamical symmetry breaking considered in theories beyond the standard model .",
    "recently , bunk et al . have studied the njl model in spacetime with an extra dimension @xcite . as in a non - renormalizable model",
    ", it is worth studying the effect of two different scales , the cutoff scale and the compactification scale .    in the present paper ,",
    "we introduce the four - dimensional models similarly as in the view point of dimensional deconstruction @xcite and investigate the one - loop quantum effect in a theory with a finite spectrum of fermions . in dimensional deconstruction models",
    "@xcite , excitation modes exist , similarly in higher - dimensional theory , and it is known that similar features are found as in higher - dimensional theory in a certain case . in a model which",
    "consists of four dimensional fermions of a limited number as in the dimensional deconstruction , we wish to investigate how quantum effects bring about symmetry breaking .",
    "two situations can be considered about chiral symmetry in construction of our models .",
    "one is the case where it has a mass spectrum based on a deconstruction model . in this case ,",
    "quantum correction to the fermion mass would be observed and a large amount of condensation of fermion is expected for a certain strong coupling .",
    "another situation is the case where chiral symmetry is imposed about all the fermion fields in the model . in this case",
    ", the condensation of fermions through quantum effect at strong coupling produces massive states of fermions . even in this case , as seen later , the technique used in a deconstruction model is valid for obtaining the one - loop effect by a prescription using auxiliary fields .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we consider model a , in which the mass matrix of fermions is introduced .",
    "similarity to a five dimensional four - fermion model will be discussed . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we consider a massless njl model with ` non - diagonal ' four - fermion interactions , as model b. the interacting term is chosen as the effective fermion masses have a spectrum akin to that in a deconstruction model .",
    "we end with a summary in sec .",
    "in this section , we consider a type of a massive njl model .",
    "the free part of the lagrangian for fermion fields takes the form @xmath0 + \\sum_{k=1}^n \\left[\\bar{\\lambda}_{k}(m_0\\chi_{k}-f\\chi_{k+1})+{\\rm h.c.}\\right ] \\",

    "the ` bare ' mass @xmath3 and the constant @xmath4 have dimension of mass and take real values .",
    "the @xmath5-st fields should be identified to the first one , i.e. , @xmath6 .",
    "the eigenvalues for the fermion mass - squared are given by @xmath7 with @xmath8 and if and only if @xmath9 , a zero eigenvalue exists @xcite .",
    "the eigenmodes turn out to be @xmath10    now , we introduce an interacting part of the lagrangian . we assume it as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the four - fermion coupling and the total lagrangian is supposed to be @xmath13 .",
    "the four - fermi interaction is ` local ' with respect to each entry of the fermion , and it is different from the interaction in the gross - neveu model @xcite .",
    "apparently , if @xmath9 , only the zero - mode fermion possesses chiral symmetry .",
    "the interaction term can be replaced by the term including an auxiliary field .",
    "that is , the interacting part of the lagrangian can be rewritten to @xmath14 -\\sum_{k=1}^n\\frac{|\\sigma_k - m_0|^2}{g}\\,,\\ ] ] where the complex fields @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) are auxiliary fields .    throughout the present paper ,",
    "we use a homogeneity ansatz @xmath17 and the modulation with respect to @xmath18 is assumed to be negligible .",
    "now , we can obtain the effective potential for @xmath19 up to one - loop order in the following form : @xmath20 where the effective mass of fermions are given by @xmath21 .",
    "the amount of fermion condensation is determined by the gap equation @xmath22 .",
    "the one - loop effective potential is evaluated formally by schwinger s parameter integral as @xmath23 = \\frac{2}{(4\\pi)^2}\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{dt}{t^3}\\sum_{p=0}^{n-1 } \\exp\\left[-m_p^2t\\right ] \\,.\\ ] ] furthermore , we can apply the formula @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the modified bessel function , to the expression .",

    "is finite . ] therefore , some regularization is needed .",
    "several regularization methods on schwinger s parameter integral have been considered by many authors .",
    "a ` minimal subtraction ' method @xcite uses the cutoff method only for the divergent part as in the original njl model .",
    "a use of density with cutoff @xcite is also considered . in the present paper",
    ", we adopt the simple introduction of the cutoff scale @xmath33 , as for the lower bound of @xmath34 as @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "namely , we use @xmath36 defined by @xmath37i_\\ell(2f|\\sigma|t)\\,,\\ ] ] instead of @xmath38 .",
    "it is obvious that the one - loop part of the potential , @xmath39 , has a @xmath40 symmetry ; @xmath39 is invariant under the change that @xmath41 .",
    "a typical shape is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] as in a density plot , where the brighter region means the larger value of the potential .",
    "ponde.eps    we find that the maximum of @xmath42 is located at the value for @xmath43 which is smaller than @xmath4 . thus , if the bare mass @xmath9 , the ` dynamical ' mass @xmath44 becomes larger than @xmath4 , unless @xmath45 .",
    "this is due to the interaction term which mixes the eigenmodes of the free theory .",
    "conversely , the choice of @xmath3 can lead to the unmodified mass , @xmath46 , for any small value for @xmath12 .",
    "this can be achieved by setting the maximum of @xmath42 is located at @xmath47 .",
    "then the condensation of fermions vanishes . in this case",
    ", let us denote the special value for mass as @xmath48 , which is expressed as a function of @xmath49 . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , @xmath50 is plotted against @xmath49 . for large @xmath49",
    ", the value of @xmath48 approaches to the value @xmath4 .",
    "moverf.eps    incidentally , we recognize an existence of the case that @xmath51 is possible for the bare mass in the range @xmath52 with an appropriate tuning of @xmath12 .",
    "thus , when @xmath49 becomes large , @xmath53 converges to zero also in this case .",
    "the qualitative features stated so far are independent of @xmath54 .",
    "the critical coupling @xmath55 for fermion condensation is calculated from the second derivative @xmath56 at @xmath57 . if @xmath58 , the effective potential @xmath56 becomes a local maximum at @xmath59 .",
    "then , condensation of fermions is expected to pick a large value and even the lowest mass eigenvalue of fermions acquires a large mass .",
    "we show the value of @xmath60 for @xmath61 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , for relatively large values of @xmath49 .",
    "critg.eps    now , we further investigate the limiting case that @xmath49 is large . for @xmath62 and @xmath63 , we can estimate the one - loop effect as @xmath64i_0(2f|\\sigma|\\lambda^{-2}t)\\nonumber \\\\ & \\approx&\\frac{2\\lambda^4}{(4\\pi)^2}\\int_1^\\infty\\frac{dt}{t^3}\\exp \\left[-(f-|\\sigma|)^2\\lambda^{-2}t\\right ] \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\\pi f|\\sigma|\\lambda^{-2}t}}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore in the region @xmath65 , @xmath42 is approximated as @xmath66\\,.\\ ] ] the critical value for @xmath67 calculated from the approximation appears to be proportional to @xmath4 .",
    "this observation qualitatively agrees with the result shown in fig .",

    "the comparison to a higher - dimensional model is worth studying .",

    "@xmath71 suppose that the fifth dimension is compactified to a circle whose circumference is @xmath72 .",

    "for large value of @xmath75 , this expression can be approximated , using an identity for the elliptic theta function , as @xmath76\\,.\\ ] ] by comparison of two models , the critical coupling @xmath77 for condensation of the fermion in the five dimensional model is found to be related to the critical coupling @xmath67 in the four dimensional model as the following manner : @xmath78 for large @xmath49 . because the relation between deconstruction models and kaluza - klein models is @xmath79 for large @xmath4 and large @xmath54 @xcite , the relation reads @xmath80 .",
    "the appearance of the characteristic number of the model , @xmath54 , indicates that the five - dimensional model and the four - dimensional model considered here have a common feature but are not entirely equivalent in the limit .",
    "the dimensional deconstruction has a continuum limit to the higher - dimensional theory for free fields , but exact discretization is not realized by the method generally .",
    "the difference in the degree of freedom of auxiliary fields between four and five dimensional model is due to the absence of chirality in five dimensions .",
    "we think that more similar five - dimensional model is the model with a @xmath81 gauge field .",
    "the vector field in the compactified fifth dimension plays a role of the imaginary part of the order parameter .",
    "the analysis on such a model will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the model b proposed in this section does not include mass scales as input parameters .",
    "this model mimics the model a , in view of the coupling between adjacent fermions .",
    "simply speaking , the mass scale @xmath4 is supposed to be replaced by an auxiliary field @xmath82 .",

    "the model a turns out to be related to a higher - dimensional model for a large mass scale @xmath98 .",
    "we find that the model b can exhibit a fermion mass spectrum as in the deconstruction models .    because of the variety of the effective fermion mass , the effective potential at finite temperature or density may lead to various phases for condensation .",
