    "the crab nebula is the remnant of a supernova observed in 1054 ad .",
    "the explosion left behind a rotating neutron star emitting electromagnetic radiation pulsed at the rotation period , that powers a wind of relativistic particles .",
    "these particles interact with the remnant gas and magnetic field , causing the nebula to glow brightly at all wavelengths , predominantly by synchrotron radiation .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the nebula is , accordingly , dominated by a synchrotron component extending from radio wavelengths into the gamma - ray band @xcite . above 450 mev",
    "a second component emerges , attributed to inverse - compton scattering by the same relativistic particles @xcite .",
    "the angular size of the crab nebula is @xmath00.1@xmath5 in the optical and smaller at higher energies .",
    "this corresponds to 3.5 pc , or 11 ly , at its estimated distance of 2 kpc @xcite .",
    "today , the pulsar and nebula ( henceforth referred to together as the crab ) are considered prime examples of non - thermal sources in the universe and serve as a laboratory for relativistic plasma physics .",
    "new puzzles for our understanding of the crab have been posed by the detection of three bright gamma - ray flares by the agile satellite and the large area telescope ( lat ) on board the _ fermi _ satellite between 2007 and 2010 @xcite . during these flares the unpulsed component of the gamma - ray flux increased by a factor of @xmath010 on time scales as short as 12 hours @xcite , while the period and flux of the pulsed component remained stable .",
    "more recently , in april of 2011 the lat detected a fourth flare , three times brighter than any of the previous ones @xcite .",
    "the flare was swiftly confirmed by the agile satellite @xcite .",
    "observations at lower energies , in particular by the chandra x - ray observatory , have not yet revealed any variability correlated with the gamma - ray flares @xcite . however ,",
    "analysis of these observations is ongoing and will be discussed elsewhere . here",
    "we present the lat gamma - ray results obtained during the flare , together with a broader analysis of the first 35 months of crab observations by _",
    "the lat is a pair - conversion telescope , sensitive to gamma rays with energies greater than 20 mev .",
    "it has a large field of view ( @xmath02.4 sr ) and images the full sky every three hours .",
    "the angular resolution of the lat varies with photon energy .",
    "the 68% containment radius ranges from approximately 6@xmath6 at 70 mev to 0.2@xmath6 above 10 gev @xcite .",
    "lat scientific observations began in august 2008 .",
    "we analyzed data taken within 20@xmath6 of the crab in the first 35 months of observations ( mjd 5468355728 ) .",
    "the average spectral properties of the crab were derived from the first 33 months of observations ( mjd 5468355664 ) , excluding the april 2011 flare .",
    "fluxes and spectra were obtained by maximizing the likelihood of source models using unbinned gtlike from the _ fermi _ science tools 9 - 23 - 01 .",
    "the models included all sources in the second lat source catalog within 20@xmath6 of the crab position @xcite plus models for the galactic and isotropic diffuse emission ( gal_2yearp7v6_v0 , iso_p7v6source ) .",
    "the parameters left free to vary in the likelihood fit for 33-month average spectra were the spectral parameters of the crab , the normalization of the diffuse components and a power - law spectral index for scaling the galactic diffuse emission model . for analysis on shorter",
    "time scales only the isotropic diffuse normalization was varied along with the crab spectral properties .",
    "all other parameters were fixed to the 33-month average maximum likelihood values .",
    "the sun was included in the source model when it was within 20@xmath6 of the crab .",
    "the solar spectra during the two passages in front of the crab were taken from @xcite .",
    "the moon was not included in the source model as its gamma - ray contamination was found to be negligible for observations presented here .",
    "we used the p7_v6_source instrument response functions without in - flight psf corrections , selecting photon events between 70 mev and 300 gev .",
    "compared to the more typical 100 mev threshold this choice leads to additional systematic errors due to increased dispersion in the photon energy reconstruction .",
    "the overall systematic flux error is energy dependent : it amounts to 30% at 70 mev and decreases to 10% above 10 gev @xcite .",
    "the dominant part of this systematic error is related to the overall flux normalization .",
    "it is caused by uncertainties in the effective area determination and of the overall normalization of energy scale .",
    "the stability of the lat instrument over time was tested for all time scales addressed in this publication using the vela and geminga pulsars , which are found to be stable in flux @xcite .",
    "their flux variations were @xmath710% , yielding an upper limit on the variations of the systematic errors with time .",
    "a more detailed study of the systematic uncertainties is currently being prepared within the lat collaboration for publication .",
    "the pulsar phase was assigned to the detected gamma rays based on a high - time - resolution pulsar ephemeris . to obtain the latter we extracted 400 pulsar times - of - arrival ( toas ) from lat photons collected from mjd 54684 - 55668 with a typical uncertainty of @xmath8100@xmath9s @xcite .",
    "using tempo2 @xcite , we fit a timing solution to these toas with a typical residual of 108@xmath9s , or about @xmath10 of the pulsar period . to obtain these white residuals , we modeled the pulsar timing noise using the method of @xcite , with 20 harmonically related sinusoidal terms .",

    "the gray region indicates the adopted off - pulse interval where the emission is dominated by the nebula .",
    "the flare phase profile has been multiplied by a factor 59 , such that the excess above the off - pulse counts is the same as for the 33 months of observations .",
    "this demonstrates that the flare is a phase - independent flux increase.,scaledwidth=46.0% ]",
    "the crab appears to the lat as a point source , even at the highest photon energies . to separate nebular gamma - ray emission from that of the pulsar",
    "we apply a cut on the pulsar phase .",
    "the phased count rate of the pulsar with its double - peaked structure is shown in figure [ phase ] .",
    "the pulsar dominates the phase - averaged gamma - ray flux , but its flux in the off - pulse interval from 0.56 to 0.88 is negligible @xcite .",

    "this emission is constrained to pulses which are narrower by a factor of approximately two compared to the lat energy range .",
    "pulsed emission at these energies challenges current pulsar models @xcite .",
    "a more detailed spectral analysis of the crab pulsar in the _ fermi_-lat energy range and its connection to the pulsed vhe emission is currently being performed and will be published elsewhere .",
    "in order to probe the flux variation over time , the flux from the crab was evaluated in 12-hour time intervals .",
    "the combined pulsar and nebular spectrum was modeled as a power - law in energy , as further spectral features are not resolvable on these short time scales for typical observed fluxes .",
    "the resulting light curve is shown in figure [ lcall ] , where the three flares previously reported by the _ fermi - lat _ collaboration are indicated .",
    "variability is seen over the whole 35-month period .",
    "this is also apparent in the fourier power density spectrum ( pds ) shown in figure [ spectrum ] , which is approximately described by a power law with a spectral index of @xmath00.9 .",

    "the pds of the low activity period between mjd 5488455457 is shown by the solid blue line .",

    "this was confirmed observationally on monthly time scales for the first 24 months of _ fermi _ observations @xcite . to test this assumption on the 12-hour time",

    "the inverse - compton component of the nebula is too faint to be consistently detected in 12-hour time windows .",
    "therefore the variability of this component can not be quantified from our analysis on these time scales . however , significant flux variations of the inverse - compton component on short time scales are strongly disfavored theoretically .",
    "the observed absence of variations on monthly time scales is consistent with constancy on the shorter scales of interest here .    on 2011",

    "_ fermi_. on such time scales occultation of the source by the earth needs to be taken into account .",
    "the time binning was therefore adjusted such that only time periods during which the crab is visible to the lat are used .",
    "these visibility windows were further split into bins of equal exposure , yielding a mean bin duration of nine minutes .",
    "the evolution of the flux during the flare in this binning is shown in figure [ lcflare ] .",
    "the flare lasted for approximately 9 days and is composed of two sub - flares , peaking around mjd 55665 and mjd 55667 . during both ,",
    "the flux increased rapidly , reaching its maximum value within approximately one day . a second rise or `` shoulder ''",
    "is observed during the decaying phase of both sub - flares .",
    "whether this is coincidental can not be assessed on the basis of these two events alone .",
    "if these shoulders are not interpreted as additional flares of lower amplitude , the decay time is approximately 1.5 and 3 days for the first and second sub - flare , respectively .        to investigate the significance of peaks on smaller time scales in the flare light curve , we decomposed it into periods compatible with a constant flux .",
    "the time windows are referred to as `` bayesian blocks '' ( bbs ) .",
    "they were determined finding the partition which maximizes the sum of the cost function assigned to each bb @xcite .",
    "the cost function was set to the logarithm of the maximum likelihood for the constant flux hypothesis .",
    "the algorithm to determine the optimal partition is described by @xcite .",
    "the bb - binned light curve is shown in figure [ lcflare ] .",
    "it is statistically compatible with the original light curve ( @xmath31 = 257/232 ) .",
    "this implies that flux variations within each bb can not be distinguished with confidence from a locally constant flux .",
    "the shortest bbs are detected at the maximum of both sub - flares and have durations of @xmath09 hours .    in order to measure the rate of flux increase at the rising edges of the sub - flares we parametrized them with an exponential function plus a constant background .",
    "the best - fit functions are shown in figure [ lcflare ] .",
    "the time ranges over which the fits were performed were defined by the centers of the bbs before and at the maximum of each sub - flare .",
    "the resulting doubling time is 4.0 @xmath4 1.0 hours and 7.0 @xmath4 1.6 hours for the first and second sub - flare , respectively .",
    "as these values depend on the somewhat arbitrarily chosen parametrization and fit ranges , we conservatively estimate that the doubling time scale in both sub - flares is t@xmath32 hours .",
    "the pds of the april 2011 flare is shown in figure [ spectrum ] .",
    "it was obtained by computing the fourier transform of the autocorrelation function using an algorithm for unevenly sampled data @xcite .",
    "the pds can be described by a power law of index @xmath01.1 and reaches the noise floor at a frequency of @xmath00.6 cycles per day .",
    "the doubling time of the corresponding sinusoidal component is @xmath010 hours , in agreement with the expectation from the measured doubling times of the flares .",
    "the pulsar flux remained unchanged during the flare , with an average flux above 100 mev of @xmath33 @xmath2 s@xmath3 during the main part of the flare ( mjd 55663.7055671.02 ) .",
    "the flux increase is phase - independent .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ phase ] , where the phasogram during the main flare period is shown .",
    "the peaks in the on - pulse interval remain at the same position .",
    "we also searched for periodicities other than the crab pulsar with the time - differencing technique @xcite , applying the event - weighting technique described in @xcite .",
    "we scanned the frequency range 0.1256 hz , allowing for a possible spindown up to twice the value of the crab pulsar .",
    "no significant signal was found besides the pulsar , which was detected with a significance @xmath34 .",
    "finally , we searched for photon clumping on time scales shorter than the @xmath010 min time binning by applying a bayesian block analysis on the single photon arrival times , with no significant detection .      in order to measure the energy spectrum during the flare , and its evolution with time ,",
    "the data must be averaged in time intervals long enough to ensure adequate photon statistics , but short enough to provide adequate temporal resolution .",
    "the 11 bins of approximately constant flux , derived from the bb analysis , provide a reasonable compromise between these two constraints .",
    "the seds for each of the time bins are shown in figure [ specevol ] , after subtracting the steady emission from the pulsar and the inverse - compton component of the nebula .",
    "it can be clearly seen that a new spectral component emerges from the synchrotron nebula during the flare , moving into the _ fermi _ energy range as the flare evolves .",
    "its flux reaches a maximum between mjd 55666.99755667.366 ( frame 7 ) ; during this period the peak in the sed is clearly detected at @xmath35 = ( 375 @xmath4 26 ) mev .",
    "it is difficult to parametrize the spectral shape of the flaring component due to the likely contamination by background flux from the synchrotron nebula not related to the flare .",
    "the determination of the latter is degenerate with the measurement of the flare component , as only the summed flux is measured . to break this degeneracy we proceeded under the following assumptions :    1 .",
    "the spectrum of the synchrotron nebula during the flare can be described by a power - law function and does not vary in time .",
    "the spectrum of the flaring component can be described by a power - law with an exponential cutoff ( equation [ superexp ] with @xmath36 ) . while the cutoff energy and normalization of the spectrum vary , the spectral index remains constant during the flare .",
    "we derived the spectral index of the flaring component and the spectrum of the background synchrotron component in a composite likelihood fit to all the time windows displayed in figure [ lcflare ] , simultaneously measuring the energy cutoff and flux normalization evolution of the flaring component in each of the time windows .",
    "for this we used the composite likelihood 2 part of the _ fermi _ science tools .",
    "the best - fit values for the background synchrotron nebula during the flare period are @xmath37 = ( 5.4 @xmath4 5.2 ) 10@xmath38 @xmath2 s@xmath3 and @xmath39 = 3.9 @xmath4 1.3 , consistent with the average value measured during the first 33 months of observation .",

    "the data are therefore compatible with the interpretation that a new spectral component of a fixed spectral shape evolves during the flare .",
    "as shown in figure [ corr ] the cutoff energy of the flaring component varies significantly , having a statistical probability of being constant of only 0.04% .",
    "however , while @xmath42 varies by more than an order of magnitude , the cutoff energy varies only by approximately a factor of two .",

    "a year after first being reported , the gamma - ray flares from the crab remain enigmatic .",
    "where within the nebula does the emission come from ?",
    "what produces the flux variations ?",
    "how were the emitting particles accelerated ? how are the flares related to the variability observed on yearly and monthly time scales ?",
    "although several ideas have been proposed , no certain answers can be given today .",
    "the observations presented here give us the most precise look into the flare phenomenon to date , during the brightest outburst detected so far .",
    "we will proceed to discuss some of the implications and challenges posed by these observations .",
    "one striking property of the crab nebula flares is their rapid flux variations , doubling within t@xmath47 hours at the rise of the 2011 april flare .",
    "causality arguments imply that the emission region is compact , with a length @xmath48 pc .",
    "the emitted isotropic power at the peak of the flare of @xmath49 erg s@xmath3 corresponds to @xmath01% of the total spin - down power of the pulsar , the ultimate energy source of the nebula .",
    "it is difficult to explain how this energy is focused into such a small emission volume .",
    "the focusing is generally easier to explain when the emission site is closer to the pulsar .",
    "the absence of pulsation in the flare signal implies that the emission region is at least located outside the light cylinder of the pulsar .",
    "another possibility to explain the flare brightness is that the emission is highly anisotropic , as would be expected if the emission region moves relativistically toward us .",
    "while only mildly relativistic motion with velocities of @xmath00.5c are observed inside the nebula @xcite , relativistic motion is expected in the pulsar wind and in the downstream medium behind the wind termination @xcite .",
    "relativistic bulk motion is particularly expected at the `` arch shock '' of the wind termination , which has been proposed as the main site of gamma - ray emission @xcite .",
    "the flare emission is expected to result from synchrotron radiation by relativistic electrons and positrons ( henceforth referred to together as electrons ) @xcite .",
    "a new spectral component emerges in the sed during the flare .",
    "the hard photon spectrum ( @xmath50 ) of the flaring component implies that most of the electron energy is carried by the highest energy electrons .",
    "if the electron _ particle _ density @xmath51 per energy at an energy @xmath52 is characterized by a power law @xmath53 , the spectral index is @xmath54 , in a random magnetic field in which the electrons are isotropically distributed .",
    "the energy per logarithmic energy interval , which is proportional to @xmath55 , is therefore rising with energy .",
    "we note that such a spectrum is also inferred for the radio emitting electrons in the crab nebula , and more generally in pulsar wind nebulas @xcite .",
    "while the radio emission is produced by a different electron population than the gamma - ray flares , efficient particle acceleration appears to be a common feature in these systems .",
    "it is an interesting question how such a hard electron spectrum is produced .",
    "standard diffusive shock acceleration typically results in spectra with @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "even though it has been shown that harder spectra can be produced in certain field configurations with low - level turbulence @xcite , these conditions are not expected at termination shocks of pulsar winds .",
    "additionally , shock acceleration appears to be inefficient at highly oblique shocks that are representative of the pulsar wind termination discontinuity @xcite .",
    "one alternative is that magnetic reconnection in the striped pulsar wind might accelerate particles @xcite .",
    "however , simulations show that reconnection behind the pulsar termination probably does not provide the required electron energies to produce gamma - ray emission @xcite .",
    "another interesting possibility is that acceleration is occurring directly in the electric field induced by the pulsar , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "the observation of a peak synchrotron energy of @xmath0380 mev is among the highest yet seen from astrophysical source today .",
    "the observation is surprising as particle acceleration in the presence of synchrotron cooling is expected to limit synchrotron emission to photon energies below @xmath0150 mev @xcite .",
    "two solutions to this problem have been proposed recently in this context :    1 .   the electric field at the acceleration site is larger in magnitude than the magnetic field .",
    "this is generally an unstable state in plasma , as charges will short out the electric field ; however , temporarily such a configuration is expected , e.g. in magnetic reconnection events . the gamma - ray emission might occur afterward ,",
    "when the accelerated electrons enter a region of enhanced magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "more detailed studies are required to assess whether such a scenario is plausible in the nebula environment and can be sustained for the duration of the flares .",
    "the gamma rays are emitted in a region of bulk relativistic motion , and are therefore doppler boosted toward the observer @xcite . for a flow moving directly toward us a lorentz factor",
    "@xmath57 is sufficient to accommodate the observed peak energy .",
    "variations in the doppler boosting can naturally account for the observed flux variation @xcite .",
    "the observed spectral evolution is compatible with such an interpretation : the energy flux of the emission varies approximately as a power of @xmath46 = 3.42 @xmath4 0.86 with the cutoff energy ; a correlation with @xmath58 3 is indeed expected for variations produced by changes in relativistic beaming @xcite .",
    "the flare brightness , the high frequency of the observed peak of the gamma - ray emission , and the spectral evolution during the flare all suggest the presence of relativistic beaming .",
    "we therefore conclude that , independent of the location of the emission region and the physical processes responsible for the flares , the emission region is moving relativistically toward us , and changes in its motion are likely the predominant mechanism responsible for the observed flux variations .",
    "such a kinematic explanation does however not address the issue of how a moving source can be created dynamically and sustained radiatively in the face of strong losses .",
    "the crab nebula still has much more to teach us .",
    "the _ _ fermi _ _ lat collaboration acknowledges generous ongoing support from a number of agencies and institutes that have supported both the development and the operation of the lat as well as scientific data analysis .",

    "<S> the large area telescope on board the _ _ fermi _ _ satellite observed a gamma - ray flare in the crab nebula lasting for approximately nine days in april of 2011 . </S>",
    "<S> the source , which at optical wavelengths has a size of @xmath011 ly across , doubled its gamma - ray flux within eight hours . </S>",
    "<S> the peak photon flux was @xmath1 @xmath2 s@xmath3 above 100 mev , which corresponds to a 30-fold increase compared to the average value . during the flare , </S>",
    "<S> a new component emerged in the spectral energy distribution , which peaked at an energy of ( 375 @xmath4 26 ) mev at flare maximum . </S>",
    "<S> the observations imply that the emission region was likely relativistically beamed toward us and that variations in its motion are responsible for the observed spectral variability . </S>"
