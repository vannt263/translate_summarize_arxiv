    "this group is an important invariant of the tensor category @xmath0 and appears at essential places such as group - theoretic extension of @xmath0 and as defects in mathematical physics , see applications below . by a result in @xcite@xcite",
    "the group is isomorphic to braided autoequivalences of the drinfeld center @xmath2 ; this will be crucial in what follows .",
    "+ computing the brauer - picard group , even for @xmath3 or equivalently @xmath4 for a finite group @xmath5 , is already an interesting and non - trivial task , see @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",

    "_ we have proven such a decomposition for the case @xmath13 $ ] for elements fulfilling an additional restriction ( laziness ) .",
    "moreover we checked the decomposition in all available examples by hand .",
    "it is unclear at this point if it is true in general .",
    "the intuition arises from    let @xmath14 with @xmath15 a prime number .",
    "our decomposition reduces to the bruhat decomposition of @xmath16 , which is the lie group @xmath17 over the finite field @xmath18 . in this case @xmath10",

    "the partial dualizations are weyl group elements .",
    "more precisely , our result reduces to the bruhat decomposition of the lie groups @xmath20 relative to the parabolic subsystem @xmath21 , so reflections are actually equivalence classes corresponding to @xmath22 cosets of the parabolic weyl group .",
    "the present article is devoted to start the discussion of the more general case @xmath6 .",
    "we shall not try to prove a decomposition theorem , but focus our attention on establishing and discussing the expected natural subgroups @xmath23 of the brauer picard group .",
    "we will also briefly discuss several interesting applications of our results , in particular when @xmath7 is the borel part of a quantum group resp . a nichols algebra .",
    "+ in section [ sec_category ] we briefly recall the induction functor and the enom - functor @xcite @xmath24 in view of interesting examples and the applications to defects in mathematical physics and nichols algebras we state the obvious generalization of these concepts to the groupoid setting , so that arbitrary monoidal equivalences @xmath25 give rise to invertible @xmath0-@xmath26-bimodule categories , and these are in bijection to braided equivalences @xmath27 . + in section [ sec_subgroups ]",
    "we define and derive for each subgroup @xmath28 and the subset @xmath11 explicit expressions for the braided autoequivalence as well as the invertible bimodule categories .    on one hand @xmath29 resp .",
    "@xmath30 are obtained using induction functors from @xmath31 resp .",
    "so the bimodule categories in @xmath33 resp .",
    "@xmath34 are given by definition .",
    "we then calculate explicitly the images under the enom functor using bigalois objects and finally we describe again the preimage of @xmath30 now in @xmath33 . as linear categories ,",
    "the bimodule categories in @xmath29 are all equal to @xmath0 , while the bimodule categories in @xmath30 are representation categories of bigalois objects , as in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand the set of elements @xmath11 is defined as partial dualizations on the @xmath35-side of the functor as obtained by the first author in @xcite .",
    "there are two types of partial dualization , for every way to decompose @xmath36 into a ( semidirect ) radford - biproduct . as linear categories ,",
    "the bimodule categories in @xmath11 are representations of semidirect factors of @xmath7 ( so they may be significantly `` smaller '' , down to @xmath37 ) but with a largely nontrivial bimodule category structure @xmath38 .",
    "+ in section [ sec_examples ] we discuss examples : mostly we work out the result for @xmath4 , which has been discussed extensively .",
    "in particular we discuss how our bimodule categories look in the explicit description of @xcite@xcite .",
    "then we thoroughly discuss the case where @xmath7 is the taft algebra and compare our results with @xcite . + in section [ sec_applications ] we discuss applications :    a.   first we discuss interesting types of bimodule categories that arise from our constructions for a nichols algebra @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "this includes for example the quantum group borel parts @xmath40 resp .",
    "+ first , due to the bigalois objects there are interesting elements in @xmath10 related to different _ liftings _ of quantum groups , most of which have non - equivalent representation categories @xmath42 but are connected by invertible bimodule categories . + even more interesting are the partial dualizations : we may either dualize on the cartan part @xmath43 $ ] , then we obtain invertible bimodule categories between different _ forms _ of @xmath41 e.g. between the adjoint and the simply - connected form .",
    "+ alternatively we we may dualize on parabolic sub - nichols algebras , then partial dualization reduces to the usual weyl group reflection of the quantum group . in this way we get invertible bimodule categories connecting different choices of positive roots , and as linear categories these are representations of coideal subalgebras . + at last , we remark that the @xmath44-side of all these elements , which we have worked out explicitly in the previous sections , give rise to braided autoequivalences of the representation category of the full quantum group .",
    "+ b.   an interesting application to mathematical physics are defects : ( bi-)module categories appear as boundary conditions and defects in @xmath45-tqft , in particular the brauer - picard group is the symmetry group of such theories , see @xcite,@xcite . +",
    "our results give three systematic , generic families of examples for such defects .",
    "more importantly , they give many examples of invertible bimodule categories between different categories . in a general tqft",
    "the defects separate different regions of space , which can be labeled by different categories .",
    "particularly interesting in this matter are again the concrete examples arising from quantum groups .",
    "+ c.   finally , a leading motivation for the consideration of the brauer picard group is , that group - theoretic extensions of categories are parametrized by group homomorphisms into the brauer picard group @xcite .",
    "we close this article by briefly discussing , which types of categories arise for our three subgroups . +",
    "this includes representations of the folded nichols algebras over nonabelian groups constructed by the first author in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath42 be finite tensor categories with base field @xmath46 .",
    "the _ brauer picard groupoid _ @xmath47 has as objects tensor categories @xmath42 and as morphisms equivalence classes of exact invertible bimodule categories @xmath48 and as composition the relative deligne tensor product @xmath49 .",
    "+ the automorphism group of an object @xmath0 is the _ brauer picard group _ @xmath1 .",
    "categories @xmath50 for which there exists an isomorphism @xmath48 are called _",
    "( 2- ) morita equivalent _    the _ monoidal equivalence groupoid _",

    "+ the _ braided equivalence groupoid",
    "_ @xmath54 has as objects braided tensor categories @xmath55 and as morphism braided category equivalences @xmath56 .",
    "we denote by @xmath57 the full subgroupoid consisting of objects that are drinfeld centers ( i.e. witt class @xmath58 ) .",
    "+ the automorphism group of an object @xmath0 is the group of _ monoidal autoequivalences _",
    "@xmath59 resp .",
    "_ braided autoequivalences _ @xmath60 .",
    "in fact we are actually dealing with a bicategory with 1-morphisms invertible bimodule categories and with 2-morphisms bimodule category equivalences , respectively with 1-morphism category equivalences and with 2-morphisms natural transformations .",
    "[ thm_induction ] there is an evident groupoid homomorphism @xmath61 given on objects by the identity and on morphisms @xmath62 by @xmath63 where @xmath26 is the trivial right @xmath26-module category and the trivial left @xmath26-module category precomposed with the monoidal functor @xmath64 .",
    "+ this yields in particular an evident group homomorphism @xmath65 .",
    "the following theorem is due to @xcite ; see @xcite for the non - semisimple case :    there is an equivalence of groupoids @xmath66 .",
    "+ it is given on objects by sending @xmath67 , on morphisms @xmath68 it fulfills the following defining property :    @xmath69 acts on @xmath48 as bimodule category automorphism , where the compatibility constraint @xmath70 is given by the bimodule category structure and the compatibility constraint @xmath71 is given by the half - braiding @xmath72 of the element @xmath73 .",
    "similarly @xmath74 acts on @xmath48 as bimodule category automorphism .",
    "the defining property for @xmath75 is that the module category homomorphisms @xmath76 and @xmath77 are equivalent , i.e. there is a natural transformations between these two functors that satisfy certain coherence properties with the two module category and the bimodule category structure .",
    "+ why should we hope for a bruhat - like decomposition of @xmath33 ?",
    "+ the main motivation for our initial work @xcite was the case @xmath13 $ ] for @xmath5 abelian , as treated in the second authors joint paper @xcite .",
    "in particular let @xmath14 with @xmath15 a prime number .",
    "then it is known that @xmath78 resp . @xmath79 and the choice of generators in _ cit .",
    "_ are upper triangular matrices containing the group of group automorphisms @xmath80 , and additional generators are the so - called _ em - dualities_.    as it turned out in our study , these generators are not arbitrary , but rather naturally defined subgroups , in much more general context , that can be written down without prior knowledge of the full brauer picard group and come from different sources :    two sets of generators can be obtained via different induction functors from various categories @xmath81 with @xmath82 , leading in the example for @xmath4 to upper - triangular matrices @xmath83 , as in @xcite , and for @xmath3 to lower - triangular matrices @xmath30 intersecting precisely in @xmath84 .    a third set of generators , the so - called em - dualities @xmath11 , turned out to be rather general braided autoequivalences called _ partial dualizations _ in the first authors work @xcite .",
    "these can be defined whenever a hopf algebra decomposes into a semidirect product , and a special case are simple reflections of quantum groups .",
    "+ in @xcite we have proved that every element fulfilling an additional condition ( laziness ) decomposes accordingly into an ordered product in these subgroups , also we have checked the brauer - picard group in known cases by hand .",
    "the brauer - picard group decomposition retains roughly the properties that a lie group over a ring admits ( not an honest bruhat decomposition ) , which is what we get e.g. for @xmath85 for @xmath86 not prime . +",
    "a maybe more convincing reason for our approach arose during the work on @xcite : every braided autoequivalence of @xmath87 is described through its action on objects plus a monoidal structure i.e. an element in @xmath88 .",
    "while the action on objects seems easily accessible ( one can look at invertible objects , stabilizer etc . ) , there is in general very many possibilities . in the lazy case",
    "this action if given by precomposing a hopf algebra automorphism , and the automorphism group reminds on a matrix group , but for more general cases we do nt have this luxury .    on the other hand @xmath88",
    "is rather technical , but it should not surprise us that is is connected to the groups @xmath89 and some interaction between @xmath90 .",
    "so we propose to shift classification effort to the monoidal structure of the functor , rather that its action on objects .",
    "in fact for abelian groups ( and much more general situations ) we have by schauenburg @xcite a _ knneth - type _ formula , and this decomposition * does * precisely explain the initially observed decomposition . + another interesting question is , if one can characterize elements inside one bruhat - cell : indeed for @xmath13 $ ] the `` big cell '' @xmath91 has the property that ( in the language of @xcite ) it sends the langrangian subcategory @xmath92 to some @xmath93 with @xmath94 nondegenerate .",
    "smaller bruhat - cells @xmath95 can be characterized by the degree of degeneracy of @xmath94 , down to @xmath96 which is a pure reflection .",
    "a similar picture seems to emerge in this article for the bimodule categories , where the big cell consists of @xmath97 for some algebra of same dimension as @xmath7 , while smaller cells are representations of considerable smaller algebras down to @xmath37 for the longest element in @xmath11 .",
    "+ however , these are merely speculative observations .",
    "as stated in the introduction , the present paper does not concern itself with the decomposition , but focuses solely on the definition and description of these generic subgroups in the general case :   +       + this obvious subgroup reappears as the intersection of the two upcoming subgroups .",
    "let @xmath98 be a hopf algebra isomorphism , then we have in particular a monoidal equivalence @xmath99 by precomposition .",
    "induction ( lm . [ thm_induction ] ) provides an invertible bimodule category @xmath100 .",
    "+ we claim that this element in @xmath101 gives under the enom functor rise to the functor in @xmath102 given on objects by @xmath103 and with trivial monoidal structure .",
    "similarly induction of @xmath104 provides a module category @xmath105 giving rise to the same element .",
    "+ in particular this defines a subgroup @xmath106 with @xmath107 .    to apply the defining property of the enom functor it suffices to construct a natural isomorphism between the functors @xmath108 and @xmath109 for @xmath110 :",
    "the half - braiding given by the coaction on @xmath111 gives a natural isomorphism of @xmath7-modules : @xmath112 @xmath113 we moreover have to check compatibility with the module category constraints , namely for all @xmath114 the following equality , which requires the coaction choice @xmath115 : @xmath116 @xmath117 as well as the following equality of morphisms for all @xmath118 : @xmath119 @xmath120    we also discuss the connection to a different embedding :    the authors of @xcite define for a hopf algebra @xmath7 the _ quantum brauer group _",
    "@xmath121 , an analogue of the brauer group .",
    "it consist of @xmath7-azumaya @xmath7-yetter - drinfeld algebras modulo @xmath7-morita equivalence . in @xcite",
    "they give a map @xmath122 and determine the kernel .",
    "an elements in @xmath123 gives rise to a @xmath124-module category @xmath125 , i.e. an element in the picard group .",
    "by @xcite in turn the picard group maps to the brauer - picard group and hence to the group of braided autoequivalences - to be precise thm .",
    "4.3 states that the image of the picard group consists precisely of those braided autoequivalences which are trivializable on @xmath126 .",
    "this is by construction exactly our subgroup @xmath29 in the next section .",
    "+ we shall briefly sketch , how one can explicitly see the surjection of the subgroup @xmath127 to our subgroup @xmath128 through all these identifications : we first convince ourselves how the identity @xmath129 maps to the identity : the associated azumaya algebra @xmath130 is simply @xmath131 where @xmath7 is an @xmath7-yetter - drinfeld module with adjoint @xmath7-action and diagonal @xmath7-coaction .",
    "the module category @xmath132 has ( as always ) the single simple object @xmath7 with the above yetter - drinfeld structure .",
    "now the implicit construction in @xcite sec .",
    "2.9 assigns to @xmath133 the unique equivalence class of autoequivalences @xmath134 , such that @xmath135 are equal as module category morphisms , where @xmath136 means the module category morphisms given on objects by tensoring by @xmath137 and with module category morphism structure given by the braiding resp . the inverse braiding .",
    "equal here means up to natural equivalence and indeed the double - braiding @xmath138 turns out to be such a natural isomorphism between @xmath139 and itself that switches @xmath140 .",
    "this shows how the hopf - automorphism @xmath141 indeed implies the braided autoequivalence @xmath142 as expected .",
    "+ for arbitrary @xmath143 the situation is more involved , but fairly similar : the azumaya algebra is defined as @xmath144 where @xmath145 has again the diagonal coaction but a altered adjoint action @xmath146 .",
    "this is not a yetter - drinfeld module but fulfills the altered relation @xmath147 now if @xmath148 is the yetter - drinfeld module with modified action and coaction as in the theorem above , then one can roughly see that the double braiding maps @xmath149 so the double braiding in this sense gives an isomorphism @xmath150 on objects , and as for identity the double braiding intertwines the braiding and negative braiding .",
    "+       + another rather obvious source of elements in @xmath47 is the induction functor from arbitrary monoidal equivalences ; this of course contains the previous subgroup .",
    "while the bimodule category is given by definition , the image of the enom - functor requires some preparation :    let @xmath151 be a monoidal equivalence and let us consider the inverse @xmath152 : we are assuming finite dimension , so @xmath153 is given by @xmath154 with @xmath155 an @xmath156-@xmath157-bigalois object @xcite , where @xmath158 is a hopf @xmath159-cocycle and @xmath160 is a hopf algebra isomorphism from the doi twist of @xmath157 to @xmath156 . on objects",
    "@xmath153 is just composing the coaction with @xmath161 .",
    "e.g. , for @xmath162 a dual groupring ( but not always for a nonabelian groupring ) , due to the cocommutativity of @xmath163 $ ] any doi twist is equal to @xmath157 and @xmath161 is a choice of a group isomorphism @xmath164 .    given a @xmath159-cocycle @xmath158 , then we have the following category equivalence @xmath165 : send @xmath166 to @xmath167 with the same @xmath157-coaction and modified @xmath157-action @xmath168 and monoidal structure of the functor given by @xmath169 .",
    "we can now state :    let @xmath170 and @xmath171 as above .",
    "the induction image of @xmath64 is by definition the bimodule category @xmath172 .",
    "we claim that this element in @xmath101 gives under the enom functor rise to the functor in @xmath102 given on objects by @xmath173 and with the monoidal structure of @xmath64 .    here",
    "@xmath174 means the @xmath175-module has been converted by @xmath64 to a @xmath7-module @xmath176 which means precompose the action by @xmath177 . on the other hand",
    "the @xmath156-action is pulled back to an @xmath178-action by @xmath161 and further to a @xmath157-action by @xmath179 with the previous lemma .    in particular",
    "this defines a subgroup @xmath180 which is the homomorphic image of the group @xmath181 .",
    "it is easy to see that the case @xmath182 reduces to the elements ( and the proof ) in @xmath8 .",
    "we denote the modified coaction by lower indices @xmath183 .",
    "the relevant property of its definition is that @xmath184 is a braided category equivalence which coincides with @xmath64 on the level of modules .",
    "more formally @xmath185 .",
    "using this property the proof works automatically as in the previous section : + the half - braiding ( with modified coaction and action , but unmodified action on @xmath186 ! ) @xmath187 @xmath188 gives clearly a natural isomorphism of @xmath7-modules , since we can write it as a braiding of @xmath189 with @xmath190 .",
    "+ then we check the coherence conditions using the relevant property : @xmath191 @xmath192 as well as the more trivial relation @xmath193 @xmath194       + since @xmath195 we may as well induce up from @xmath196 , which is in general not related to @xmath181 - except the common subgroup @xmath197 . here by definition @xmath198 induces the @xmath32-bimodule category @xmath199 and the image of @xmath64 under the enom functor in @xmath195 is dual to the last section .",
    "however , it is not clear what the @xmath31-bimodule category associated to @xmath64 is ; this is clarified by :    let @xmath200 and consider again @xmath153 , which we write as cotensoring with a @xmath175-@xmath7-bigalois object @xmath201 with @xmath202 and @xmath203 .",
