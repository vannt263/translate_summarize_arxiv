    "relativistic approaches based on the dirac equation as the relevant wave equation have proved to be very successful in treating the proton elastic and inelastic scatterings at intermediate energies from the spherically symmetric nuclei [ 1 - 4 ] and a few deformed nuclei [ 5 - 12 ] .",
    "considerable improvements have been shown in the coupled channel calculations using the dirac phenomenology compared to the classical nonrelativistic calculations based on the schrdinger equation @xcite .    in this work",
    "we use phenomenological optical potentials in the dirac coupled channel calculation [ 1,2 ] to analyze 0.8 gev proton inelastic scatterings from a deformed nucleus , @xmath0ar .",
    "so far only the distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) calculation using phenomenological optical potentials in nonrelativistic formalism neglecting the coupled channel effects , or the nonrelativistic coupled channel calculation at low energy has been done to analyze the inelastic scatterings of proton from @xmath0ar nucleus [ 14 , 15 ] .",
    "a rotational collective model is used for the transition optical potentials to accommodate the collective motion of excited deformed nuclei considering the low lying excited states of the rotational bands [ 5 ] .",
    "the multistep excitation process is included in the calculation by considering the coupling between two excited states , in addition to the couplings between the ground and the excited states . in order to solve the complicated dirac",
    "coupled channel equations , we use a computer program called ecis @xcite where the dirac optical potential and the deformation parameters are determined phenomenologically by using a sequential iteration method .",
    "the dirac equations are reduced to schrdinger - like second - order differential equations to obtain the effective central and spin - orbit optical potentials , and the obtained effective potentials are analyzed and compared with those of the nonrelativistic calculations .",
    "the calculated deformation parameters for the low - lying excited states of the @xmath0ar nucleus are analyzed and compared with those calculated by using the nonrelativistic approaches .",
    "dirac analyses are performed phenomenologically for 0.8 gev unpolarized proton inelastic scatterings from @xmath0ar nucleus by using an optical potential model and a collective model . because @xmath0ar is a spin-0 nucleus ,",
    "only scalar , time - like vector and tensor optical potentials survive @xcite , as in spherically - symmetric nuclei ; hence , the relevant dirac equation for the elastic scattering from the nucleus is given as @xmath3 \\psi(r ) = 0 .",

    "even though tensor potentials always present due to the interaction of the anomalous magnetic moment of the projectile with the charge distribution of the target , they have been found to be always very small compared to the scalar or the vector potentials @xcite .",
    "hence they are neglected in this calculation .",
    "the scalar and the vector optical potentials are complex , and have the woods - saxon shapes @xcite as they are assumed to follow the distribution of the nuclear density . in the first - order rotational model of ecis ,",
    "the deformation of the radius of the optical potential is given by using the legendre polynomial expansion method @xcite .",
    "we assume that the shapes of the deformed potentials follow the shapes of the deformed nuclear densities and that the transition potentials can be obtained by assuming that they are proportional to the first - order derivatives of the diagonal potentials .",
    "however , depending on the model assumed , pseudo - scalar and axial - vector potentials may also be present in the equation when we consider the inelastic scattering . in the collective model approach used in this work",
    ", we assume that we can obtain appropriate transition potentials by deforming the direct potentials that describe the elastic channel reasonably well @xcite .",

    "the dirac coupled channel equations are solved numerically using the computer code ecis [ 16 ] which employs the sequential iteration method .",
    "we consider both the couplings between the @xmath17 ground state and the low lying excited states and also coupling between two excited states , for example , between the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 states .",
    "hence the multistep process is included in the calculation .",
    "because the channel couplings between the low - lying excited states of the rotational band are strong in the inelastic scatterings from a deformed nucleus , the multistep transition process could be important . in order to compare the calculated results with those of nonrelativistic calculations , we reduce the dirac equation to a schrdinger - like second - order differential equation by considering the upper component of the dirac wave function and obtain the effective central and spin - orbit optical potentials @xcite .",
