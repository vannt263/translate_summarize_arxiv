    "<S> we report on a comparative study of the valence band electronic structure of nio as bulk material and of nio as impurity in mgo . from the impurity </S>",
    "<S> we have been able to determine reliably the parameters which describe the local correlations , thereby establishing the compensated - spin character of the first ionization state or the state created by hole doping . </S>",
    "<S> using bulk - sensitive x - ray photoemission we identify pronounced satellite features in the valence band of bulk nio which can not be explained by single - site many body approaches nor by mean field calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we infer the presence of screening processes involving local quasi - core states in the valence band and non - local coherent many body states . </S>",
    "<S> these processes are strong and the propagation of an extra hole in the valence band of nio will therefore be accompanied by a range of high energy excitations . </S>",
    "<S> this in turn will make the observation of the dispersion relations in the ni @xmath0 bands difficult , also because the effective band width is no more than 0.25 ev as estimated from multi - site calculations .    </S>",
    "<S> nio is a benchmark system in solid state physics . </S>",
    "<S> it crystallizes in the nacl structure , has a partially filled @xmath0 shell ( ni@xmath1 @xmath2 ) , and is an antiferromagnetic insulator with a nel temperature of 523  k @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was pointed out early on by de boer and verwey @xcite that many of the properties of the @xmath0 transition metal compounds do not agree with the predictions of band theory , e.g. , standard band theory predicts nio to be metallic . </S>",
    "<S> a qualitative explanation was proposed in terms of the mott - hubbard model @xcite in which the on - site ni @xmath0-@xmath0 coulomb interaction plays a decisive role .    </S>",
    "<S> an early _ ab initio _ attempt to fix the shortcoming of band theory was to treat nio as a slater insulator in which the doubling of the unit cell allows for the existence of a gap @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the calculated gap of about 0.2  ev @xcite turned out to be much too small : a combined photoemission ( pes ) and bremsstrahlung - isochromat ( bis ) spectroscopy study showed that the band gap is 4.3  ev @xcite and established thereby the correlated nature of nio . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of a self - interaction - correction ( sic ) or hubbard @xmath3 term to the density - functional formalism may provide a justification for the magnitude of the experimental band gap @xcite .        yet , one of the most direct methods to critically test the accuracy of the different approaches , is to determine the excitation spectrum associated with the introduction of an extra particle into the system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> curve ( a ) in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 displays the valence band x - ray photoemission spectrum ( xps , @xmath4 = 1486.6  ev ) of an _ in situ _ cleaved nio single crystal . </S>",
    "<S> this spectrum represents essentially the ni @xmath0 spectral weight since the photoionization cross section of the o @xmath5 is relatively small @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one can clearly observe from curve ( e ) in fig .  1 that the ni @xmath0 density of states calculated by band theory ( in the local density approximation , lda ) does not match at all </S>",
    "<S> : it has a fermi cut - off and the line shape is completely different . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of the hubbard @xmath3 in the calculations ( lda+u ) does not solve the line shape problem , see curve ( d ) . </S>",
    "<S> all this demonstrates the shortcomings of mean field theories to describe spectra associated with the fundamental one - particle green s function of the system @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a completely different approach is to give up the translational symmetry of the system in order to focus on the local correlations and , especially , the dynamics of the propagation of the injected particle . curve ( c ) of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 shows the ni @xmath0 spectral weight from an early cluster configuration - interaction calculation by fujimori and minami @xcite , which also includes the full atomic multiplet theory . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement with the experimental spectrum is extremely good </S>",
    "<S> . nevertheless , a later cluster calculation by van elp _ et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite arrived at a less satisfactory result : peak b has almost disappeared in the calculation , see curve ( b ) . the prime motivation to use a different set of model parameters here is to infer that the first ionization state is low spin ( @xmath6 ) @xcite rather than the hund s rule high spin ( @xmath7 ) , analogous to the case of zhang - rice singlets in the cuprates @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent developments combining lda with dynamical mean field @xcite or gw approaches @xcite yield ni @xmath0 spectral weights which deviate in important details from the experimental spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> these discrepancies between the experiment and the later theoretical simulations @xcite do not provide confidence that one has made progress in understanding the nature of the first ionization state .    the issues that we need to address now are threefold . </S>",
    "<S> first of all we have to establish whether the xps valence band spectrum in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 is truly representative for bulk nio . </S>",
    "<S> there are reports in the literature claiming that certain satellite peaks in the ni @xmath5 spectrum are due to surface effects @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> second , we have to determine to what extent a single - site many body approach can be utilized to describe the electronic structure of nio for which band formation is also essential . </S>",
    "<S> third , we need to identify the nature of the first ionization state in the framework of a local _ ansatz_. to this end we measured the valence band of nio utilizing the more bulk - sensitive hard x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( haxpes ) and we investigated experimentally the electronic structure of nio impurities in mgo .    the xps data ( @xmath8  ev ) on _ in situ _ cleaved nio single crystals were recorded using a vacuum generators twin crystal monochromator al-@xmath9 source and an scienta ses-100 analyzer , with an overall energy resolution set to 0.35  ev . </S>",
    "<S> the haxpes data ( @xmath10  ev ) were taken at the taiwan beamline bl12xu of spring-8 in hyogo , japan using an mbs a-1he analyzer . </S>",
    "<S> the overall energy resolution was set to 0.35  ev . </S>",
    "<S> the nio impurity in mgo system was prepared _ in situ _ as 10 - 20 nm thin films on polycrystalline ag by means of molecular beam epitaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the measurements were performed at the 11a1 dragon beamline of the nsrrc in hsinchu , taiwan . </S>",
    "<S> the photoemission spectra were recorded at the cooper minimum of ag @xmath11 ( @xmath12  ev ) @xcite using a scienta ses-100 analyzer with an overall energy resolution set at about 0.15  ev .        in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ]  we show the valence band photoemission spectra of a freshly cleaved nio bulk crystal , taken with a photon energy of 1486.6  ev ( xps ) and 6500  ev ( haxpes ) . by increasing the photon energy </S>",
    "<S> we increase also the kinetic energy of the outgoing photoelectron and , thus , also the inelastic mean free path . </S>",
    "<S> one can estimate that the probing depth is then enhanced from about 15    to roughly 80    @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the spectra are very similar . </S>",
    "<S> we , thus , conclude that the xps data as displayed in figs .  1 and 2 is representative for the nio bulk material and that the contribution of surface effects @xcite can be safely neglected . to be specific : peak b is intrinsic for bulk nio . </S>",
    "<S> we would like to note that increasing the photon energy from 1486.6  ev to 6500  ev does not alter much the ni @xmath0 character of the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the o  @xmath5 photoionization cross section relative to that of the ni @xmath0 remains very small , it changes from 1/13 to only 1/10 @xcite , meaning that peak b truly belongs to the ni @xmath0 spectral weight and not to the o @xmath5 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> mg@xmath13o and an mgo reference , together with the resulting difference spectrum . also included is the result of a single - site nio@xmath14 configuration - interaction cluster calculation . </S>",
    "<S> the inset shows the ni @xmath15 x - ray absorption spectrum of the ni@xmath16mg@xmath13o together with that of bulk nio . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the valence band spectrum of the ni@xmath16mg@xmath13o impurity system is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] together with the spectrum of an mgo reference thin film grown simultaneously under identical oxygen and substrate conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the ni@xmath16mg@xmath13o film ( and also the mgo film ) was capped by 2 monolayers of mgo in order to prevent the surface termination to have an effect on the local electronic structure of the ni impurity . </S>",
    "<S> the inset in the figure displays the ni @xmath15 x - ray absorption spectra of the ni@xmath16mg@xmath13o and the nio bulk . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra are essentially identical , verifying that the ni in the ni@xmath16mg@xmath13o has very similar local surrounding ( nio@xmath14 octahedra ) as in the bulk .    </S>",
    "<S> the valence band spectra of the ni@xmath16mg@xmath13o and mgo systems are normalized to their o @xmath17 core level intensities . </S>",
    "<S> both are dominated by the o @xmath5 valence band , yet , there are clear differences between them due to the presence or absence of the 5% nio impurity . the difference spectrum multiplied by a factor of 6 </S>",
    "<S> is given by the red curve in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the line shape remains the same for films with lower ni concentrations , as is the case for that of the ni @xmath5 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this curve represents essentially the ni @xmath0 spectral weight of the nio impurity since the photoionization cross section of the ni @xmath0 is an order of magnitude larger than that of the o @xmath5 at the photon energy used @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> remarkable is that it is different from the spectrum of bulk nio as shown in figs .  1 and 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the impurity spectrum lacks specifically peak b which is prominently present in the bulk spectrum .    to interpret and understand the impurity spectrum , </S>",
    "<S> we have performed simulations using the well - proven configuration - interaction cluster model which includes the full atomic multiplet theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations have been carried out for a nio@xmath14 cluster using the program xtls 8.3 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the bottom curve in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] shows the ni  @xmath0 one - electron removal spectrum from the cluster calculation . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement with the experiment is very satisfactory . in order to achieve this , </S>",
    "<S> we have started the calculations by using parameter values which were suggested from earlier studies on nio @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we then fine - tune the parameters describing the octahedral crystal and ligand fields , and also the difference between the hubbard @xmath3 and the o  @xmath5-ni  @xmath0 charge transfer energy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the crucial issue here is to obtain a main line ( peak a ) without having another feature appearing at about 2  ev higher energies ( peak b ) as was the case in the simulations by fujimori and minami @xcite and by van elp _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this has implications for the energetics of the states making up the valence band as we explain in the following .    a detailed look at the cluster calculations displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 shows that peak a is given by the @xmath18 final state of the ni 3@xmath19 multiplet structure while peak b is due to the @xmath20 . avoiding the appearance of peak b means that the energy splitting between these two states must be made smaller , e.g. , 1  ev or less . </S>",
    "<S> this is what we have done in our simulation in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 , using different but equally reasonable parameter values @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the consequences for the physics are , yet , quite far reaching . </S>",
    "<S> given the fact that various x - ray absorption studies find an effective octahedral crystal and ligand field splitting of about 1.65  ev @xcite , i.e. , the splitting between the isospin @xmath20 and @xmath6 states , we arrive at the conclusion that the @xmath6 must be lower in energy than the @xmath18 by 0.65  ev or more . </S>",
    "<S> this is what we read from our results in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> our impurity study provides the spectroscopic evidence that the first ionization state has a compensated - spin character rather than the hund s rule high - spin . </S>",
    "<S> this in turn justifies that the ground state of a hole doped nio system may indeed be low - spin in nature @xcite .     and o  @xmath5 spectral weights of the nio valence band from a lda+dmft calculation ( reproduced from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) and the result of a three - site ni@xmath21o@xmath22 configuration - interaction cluster calculation . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we now return to the problem of the bulk nio valence band spectrum . fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] shows the ni @xmath0 spectral weight taken with xps and compares it with the spectra of the nio impurity and of the single - site lda+dmft calculation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one can clearly observe that peak b is absent in the impurity as well as in the ni @xmath0 spectral weight of the single - site calculation . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , one could infer that the calculation reproduces quite well the impurity spectrum , with perhaps some discrepancies due to the incomplete implementation of the multiplet structure of the on - site coulomb interactions . </S>",
    "<S> yet , the discrepancy with the bulk spectrum strongly suggests that the origin of peak b must be sought in non - local correlations , i.e. , effects which can not be included in a single - site approach .    </S>",
    "<S> our suggestion is that peak b is due to non - local screening processes involving the formation of low - energetic coherent many body states on neighboring nio clusters , which are of the @xmath6 type as we have shown above . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism is analogous as proposed earlier for the ni @xmath5 core level spectrum of bulk nio @xcite , but the application of it for the valence band is only valid for local states which are relatively stable against band formation . </S>",
    "<S> this may not be applicable for the @xmath6 state , which is a state in which a hole is injected in an @xmath23 orbital starting from the @xmath24 @xmath25 ground state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this hole can be expected to readily propagate in the lattice since the hopping between the ni @xmath0(@xmath23 ) and o @xmath5(@xmath26 ) orbitals are rather large @xcite , yet , it may leave behind an energetically costly wake of wrong spins in the antiferromagnetic lattice . in any case </S>",
    "<S> , it would not be meaningful to describe its band formation as a low - energy screening process involving neighboring @xmath6 states @xcite .     </S>",
    "<S> hole state by the photoemission process . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) screening by a next nearest neighbor nio@xmath14 cluster producing a coherent low - energetic @xmath6 hole state there . </S>",
    "<S> ]    however , for the main peak of the bulk nio spectrum , i.e. , the @xmath18 state , we infer that we can make a meaningful approximation by using the coherent @xmath6 screening model . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath18 consists of a hole injected into the @xmath27 orbital , and its ability to move is rather limited since the overlap between the ni @xmath0(@xmath27 ) and o @xmath5(@xmath28 ) is small . </S>",
    "<S> one could consider the @xmath18 as a localized quasi - core state . </S>",
    "<S> we then can invoke the non - local screening process as follows : after the creation of the @xmath18 state , an @xmath23 electron from a neighboring nio cluster hops onto the ni site , leaving behind a coherent @xmath6 hole state on that neighbor . a sketch for this process </S>",
    "<S> is given in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] . </S>",
    "<S> these two states are energetically almost degenerate @xcite , and the ni @xmath0(@xmath23 ) and o @xmath5(@xmath26 ) hybridization between them is then strong enough to produce two peaks : not only the main peak a but also the satellite peak b.    to confirm our assignments , we have performed a ni@xmath21o@xmath22 cluster calculation consisting of three edge - shared nio@xmath14 octahedra . while all the o  2@xmath29 and ni  </S>",
    "<S> 3@xmath30 orbitals are included for the nio@xmath14 octahedron in the center where the photo - excitation takes place , those on the other parts of the cluster are replaced by a reduced basis set using the method in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the results are displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ]  and demonstrate the presence of both peaks a and b. note that we have used the same parameters as for the single - site calculation which produces only peak a , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that the energy difference between peaks a and b is somewhat smaller and the intensity of peak b is slightly larger than those of the experiments . </S>",
    "<S> this can be explained by the fact that the number of neighboring ni sites is only two in the ni@xmath21o@xmath22 cluster : the energy difference will increase and the intensity of peak b will decrease for a larger number of neighboring sites @xcite .    to summarize : we have succeeded to determine reliably the ni @xmath0 valence band spectra representative for bulk nio as well as for nio as an impurity system . from the impurity data we are able to extract the local electronic structure and the correlations herein , thereby establishing firmly the compensated - spin character of the first ionization state . by comparing the bulk with the impurity system </S>",
    "<S> , we were able to identify features in the bulk nio spectrum which are caused by screening processes involving local quasi - core valence band states and non - local low - energetic many body states . </S>",
    "<S> these processes are strong and cause considerable redistribution of the spectral weight when an extra hole is injected into nio . </S>",
    "<S> this explains why fine features related to the dispersion of the ni @xmath0 band is difficult to detect @xcite , also since the effective band width is only of order 0.25 ev as estimated from our multi - site cluster calculations .    </S>",
