    "electronic transport properties of nanometer scale structures such as natural and artificial molecules ( e.g. quantum dot structures ) attached to metallic reservoirs have received a great deal of attention recently .",
    "three main reasons drive the active research in the area : i ) these systems have a fundamental role in the development of the field of  molecular electronics \" where molecules serve as electronic components;@xcite ii ) they are relatively  simple \" structures in which to address different conceptual issues regarding the nature of charge and spin transport ; @xcite and iii ) they represent the prototypical gateable structures at the nanoscale .",
    "@xcite    one of the most defining characteristics of these molecular systems is the strong spatial confinement that results in enhanced electron - electron interaction ( eei ) , and profoundly modifies their transport properties . well studied examples of the effect of eei in confined systems are coulomb blockade and kondo effect in quantum dots .",
    "@xcite molecular systems may also exhibit strong electron - phonon interactions ( epi ) , which play a significant role in their physical properties .",
    "several works have addressed the effects of epi in quantum - dot molecules for different geometrical arrangements , in a perturbative regime .",
    "@xcite it is known for example that phonons cause a broadening of coulomb blockade peaks and the appearance of satellite peaks in the nonlinear transport regime .",
    "phonons also provide relaxation mechanisms ( through inelastic scattering processes ) that affect the electronic conductance , specially in molecular systems , @xcite as well as polaronic shifts of the electronic levels .",
    "@xcite    while the effect of these different interactions on electronic transport properties has been studied extensively in regimes where one of them is dominant , not much is known when both interactions become comparable .",
    "recently , two works have addressed this issue .",
    "al - hassanieh _",
    "et al_. have studied the effect of electron - phonon interactions in the transport properties of a single - level quantum dot connected to two metalic contacts in the kondo regime . @xcite",
    "they found an unexpected cancelation of the conductance resulting from interference between the pure electronic and phonon - assisted tunneling channels .",
    "our group reported on the effect of competing interactions on the conductance of a diatomic molecule coupled to metallic reservoirs in the coulomb blockade regime and for temperatures above the kondo scale .",
    "@xcite that work focused on a regime where the energy difference between the two local electronic levels is much larger than the broadening of the levels due to the coupling to the leads . in that case , indirect coupling between the local levels is negligible and interference of the different transport channels from one lead to another is not important .",
    "utilizing the equations of motion for the various green s functions involved , we found a splitting in the electronic density of states ( dos ) of the molecule under suitable resonance conditions .",
    "this effect was identified as _ rabi - assisted tunneling _ , because of the formal similarity with the well - known rabi splitting phenomena in atomic systems , @xcite although in this case it is due to the interplay of eei and epi .",
    "the physical origin of the rabi - assisted tunneling can be traced back to the appearance of new channels for electron tunneling between the metallic reservoirs .",
    "these channels , due to eei , provide new resonance conditions for phonon emission and absorption .",
    "an immediate consequence of this result is the possibility of important changes in the conductance as function of the gate potential that controls electron occupation in the molecule , and which would be evident in experiments .",
    "this surprising result warrants a closer examination of the approximations used in the solution of the model and a thorough analysis of the various resonance and interference conditions stemming from the epi in the hamiltonian .    in the present paper ,",
    "we address these issues and include a complete analysis of the effects of the indirect coupling between the two electronic levels induced by the metallic leads .",
    "we now explore the regime where the local electronic level spacing tends to zero , which makes the phase effects much more important in the coherent transport processes .",
    "we also study in detail all resonant regimes and conducting channels provided by the epi .",
    "to solve the equations of motion , we use a hubbard - like decoupling procedure for all the green s functions involved in the calculation .",
    "@xcite this approach has proven reliable in the description of properties of interacting systems at temperatures above their characteristic kondo temperature .",
    "these calculations allow us to confirm the existence of the rabi - splitting in the dos and the appearance of resonances and anti - resonances not obtained previously .",
    "we show that there are structures in the dos depending upon resonance and anti - resonance conditions whose activation is level - occupation ",
    "dependent , reflecting the many - body nature of the problem .",
    "we further explore how the dos structures and resonance conditions affect the conductance through the diatomic molecule structure .",
    "we find that different coulomb blockade peaks in the absence of epi , appear split whenever phonons are present and this effect is enhanced at higher temperatures .",
    "our model consists of a diatomic molecule with a single level per site ( or equivalently a quantum dot pair ) with local energies @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( we assume the non - degenerate case with @xmath3 ) , as schematically shown in fig .",

    "only the electron - phonon interaction connects the local sites ( @xmath4 ) via phonons of frequency @xmath5 and with coupling constant @xmath6 . ]",
    "each single - level site ( or quantum dot ) is connected independently to two external metallic leads .",
    "we include local ( on - site ) electron - electron interactions and an electron - phonon inter - site interaction .",
    "as described the model can represent various experimental geometries ; in particular , this model was studied in the limit of non - interacting electrons , to explore interference effects .",

    "[ cond1 ] ) .",
    "we notice that the rabi splitings are generally less important for the last two resonance conditions .",
    "the reason for this behavior is that larger @xmath13 means that the original levels participating in the phonon processes are far apart , decreasing the spliting energies @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "this is clearly reflected in the respective conductance curves , where the peak splittings are very small .",

    "[ cond1 ] shows the conductance as a function of gate voltage for three different temperatures , @xmath115 , 0.025 , and 0.1 .",
    "a relatively weak dependence on temperature is observed , consistent with the fact that the resonance conditions are not explicitly dependent of the electron occupations .",

    "notice yet , that the total conductance exhibits dips and even complete vanishing due to the complex pattern of interference arising from competing channels of electrons traversing the molecule through both arms of the structure whenever @xmath66 is near the fermi level .",
    "in particular , the vanishing conductance at @xmath133 appears from the strong level anticrossing lying right at the fermi level ( see upper panel in fig .",

    "two of them , located near @xmath135 and @xmath136 are the usual coulomb blockade peaks , which are essentially not affected by the epi .",
    "the effect of phonons , however , can be seen most clearly in the appearance of an additional peak near @xmath137 , due to phonon - assisted processes .",
    "this peak arises from the anticrossing of the levels @xmath64 and @xmath128 , opening a new channel for electron transport .",
