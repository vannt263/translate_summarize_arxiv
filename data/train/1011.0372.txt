    "the evolution of the cluster abundance is a sensitive probe of the cosmological parameters because clusters populate the exponential tail of the mass function of virialised galaxy systems .",
    "accurate mass measurements are however required to avoid the propagation of systematic errors into the estimation of the cosmological parameters .",
    "there are two families of mass estimators : those which estimate the mass profiles and those that measure the mass enclosed within a specific projected radius .    traditionally , the estimation of the cluster mass is based on the assumptions of spherical symmetry and dynamical equilibrium : either the cluster galaxies move accordingly to the virial theorem @xcite , or the hot intracluster plasma which emits in the x - ray band is in hydrostatic equilibrium within the gravitational potential well of the cluster @xcite .",
    "more sophisticated approaches apply the jeans equation for a steady - state system , with the velocity anisotropy parameter @xmath12 as a further unknown ( @xcite ; @xcite ; see @xcite for a comprehensive review of various improvements of this method ) .",
    "dynamical equilibrium is also assumed when using the mass - x - ray temperature relation to estimate the cluster mass ( e.g. @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "both the slope and the normalization of the observed mass  temperature relation is grossly reproduced by synthetic clusters obtained with @xmath13-body / hydrodynamical simulations @xcite .",
    "however , the presence of non  thermal pressure support ( e.g. , related to turbulent gas motions ) and the complex thermal structure of the intra - cluster medium can significantly bias cluster mass estimates based on the application of hydrostatic equilibrium to the x  ray estimated temperature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in principle , one can improve the mass estimate by exploiting the integrated sunyaev - zeldovich effect , which depends on the first power of the gas density , rather than the square of the density as in the x - ray emission , and yields a correlation with mass which is tighter than the mass - x - ray temperature relation ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "only recently , such results have been confirmed by observations of real clusters @xcite .",
    "however , their confirmation over a large statistical ensemble has to await the results from ongoing large sunyaev - zeldovich surveys .",
    "alternatively , one can bypass the problematic gas physics and use the correlation between mass and optical richness , which is relatively easy to obtain from observations in the optical / near - ir bands , but returns mass with a poorer accuracy @xcite",
    ".    the dynamical equilibrium assumption can be dropped in the gravitational lensing techniques , because the lensing effect depends only on the amount of mass along the line of sight and not on its dynamical state ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is relevant to emphasize that all these methods do not measure the cluster mass on the same scale : optical observations measure the mass within @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the radius within which the average mass density is 200 times the critical density of the universe ; x - ray estimates rarely go beyond @xmath16 , where the x - ray surface brightness becomes smaller than the x - ray telescope sensitivity ; lensing measures the central mass within @xmath17 or the outer regions at radii larger than @xmath14 depending on whether the strong or weak regime applies . scaling relations",
    "do not provide any information on the mass profile and give the total mass within a radius depending on the scaling relation used , but still within @xmath14 .",
    "@xcite ( dg97 , hereafter ) suggested a novel method , the caustic technique , to estimate the mass from the central region out to well beyond @xmath15 with galaxy celestial coordinates and redshifts alone and without assuming dynamical equilibrium @xcite .",
    "prompted by the @xmath13-body simulations of @xcite , dg97 noticed that in hierarchical models of structure formation , the velocity field in the cluster outskirts is not perfectly radial , as expected in the spherical infall model ( @xcite ; @xcite ) but has a substantial random component .",
    "they thus suggested to exploit this fact to extract the galaxy escape velocities as a function of radius from the distribution of galaxies in redshift space . in the caustic method ,",
    "the velocity anisotropy parameter @xmath12 and the mass density profile in hierarchical clustering models combine in such a way that their knowledge is largely unnecessary in estimating the mass profile .",
    "this property explains the power of the method .",
    "this method is particularly relevant because it is an alternative to lensing to measure mass in the cluster external regions and , unlike lensing , it can be applied to clusters at any redshift , provided there are enough galaxies to sample the redshift diagram properly .",
    "we will see below that a few tens of redshifts per squared comoving megaparsec within the cluster are sufficient to apply the technique reliably .",
    "this request might have appeared demanding a decade ago , but it is perfectly feasible for the large redshift surveys currently available .",
    "@xcite were the first to apply the caustic method : they measured the mass profile of coma out to @xmath18 mpc from the cluster centre and were able to demonstrate that the @xcite ( nfw ) profile fits well the cluster density profile out to these very large radii , thus ruling out the isothermal sphere as a viable cluster model ; a few years later , the failure of the isothermal model was confirmed by the first analysis based on gravitational lensing applied to cl  0024 @xcite .",
    "the goodness of the nfw fit out to @xmath19 mpc was confirmed by applying the caustic technique to a sample of nine clusters densely sampled in their outer regions , the cluster and infall region nearby survey ( cairns , @xcite ) , and later to a complete sample of 72 x - ray selected clusters with galaxy redshifts extracted from the fourth data release of the sloan digital sky survey ( cluster infall regions in the sloan digital sky survey : cirs , @xcite ) and from the fifth data release @xcite .",
    "cirs is currently the largest sample of clusters whose mass profiles have been measured out to @xmath20 ; @xcite were thus able to obtain a statistically significant estimate of the ratio between the masses within the infall and the virial regions : they found a value of @xmath21 , in agreement with current models of cluster formation .",
    "these analyses have been extended to a sample of groups of galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite also used the cirs sample to estimate the virial mass function of nearby clusters and determined cosmological parameters consistent with wmap values @xcite .",
    "a good fit with the nfw profile out to @xmath22 was also found by @xcite who applied the caustic technique to an ensemble cluster obtained by stacking 43 clusters from the two degree galaxy redshift survey ( 2dgfrs , @xcite ) . here , unlike the previous analyses ,",
    "the caustic method was not applied to individual clusters because the number of galaxies per cluster was relatively small .",
    "recently , @xcite have applied both the caustic technique and the jeans analysis to @xmath23 cluster members of a1689 .",
    "the estimated virial mass from both methods agrees with previous lensing and x - ray analyses .",
    "the caustic method does not rely on the dynamical state of the cluster and of its external regions : there are therefore estimates of the mass of unrelaxed systems , namely the shapley supercluster @xcite , the fornax poor cluster , which shows two distinct dynamical components @xcite , the a2199 complex @xcite , and two clusters , a168 and a1367 , which are undergoing major mergers @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite analysed cl  0024 , a cluster that is likely to have suffered a recent merging event @xcite , and showed that the caustic mass and the lensing mass agree with each other , but disagree with the x - ray mass , which is the only estimate relying on dynamical equilibrium .",
    "the method was shown to return reliable mass profiles when applied to synthetic clusters extracted from @xmath13-body simulations .",
    "however , these analyses of the performance of the method either were done when the operative procedure of the technique was not yet completely developed ( dg97 ) or the results of a fully detailed analysis of the systematic errors was not provided @xcite ( d99 , hereafter ) .",
    "the dense redshift surveys currently available , especially around clusters , provide ideal data sets where the caustic technique can now be applied . with this perspective , it is therefore timely to reconsider the possible systematic errors and biases of this technique , in view of a robust application to the new data sets .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide both a transparent description of the technique , with some improvements to what is described in d99 , and a thorough statistical analysis .",
    "the caustic technique represents a powerful method to infer cluster mass profiles and complements other methods based on x - ray , sunyaev - zeldovich and lensing observations which probe different scales of the clusters .",
    "in section [ sec : basics ] we describe the basic idea of the caustic technique .",
    "section [ sec : sample ] describes the simulated cluster sample used , and section [ sec : ct ] describes the implementation of the technique . in sections [ sec : gp ] and [ sec : mass ] we estimate the accuracy of the escape velocity and mass profiles of galaxy clusters estimated with the caustic technique . in section [ sec : system ] we investigate the systematics due to the choice of the parameters .",
    "we summarize our main results and draw our conclusions in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the simple physical idea behind the caustic technique .",
    "more details are given in dg97 and d99 .",
    "in hierarchical clustering models of structure formation , clusters form by the aggregation of smaller systems falling onto the cluster from the surrounding region . the accretion does not take place purely radially ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , therefore galaxies or dark matter particles within the falling clumps have velocities with a substantial non - radial component . specifically , the r.m.s .",
    "@xmath24 of these velocities is due to the gravitational potential of the cluster and the groups where the galaxy resides , and to the tidal fields of the surrounding region . when viewed in the redshift diagram , viz .",
    "the plane of the line - of - sight ( l.o.s . ) velocity w.r.t .",
    "the cluster centre and the clustrocentric radius @xmath25 , galaxies populate a region with a characteristic trumpet shape with decreasing amplitude @xmath26 with increasing @xmath25 .",
    "this amplitude is related to @xmath27 .",
    "the breakthrough of dg97 was to identify this amplitude with the escape velocity from the cluster region corrected for a function depending on the velocity anisotropy parameter @xmath12 .    assuming a spherically symmetric system , the escape velocity @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the gravitational potential originated by the cluster , is a non - increasing function of @xmath25 , because gravity is always attractive and @xmath30 . at any given radius @xmath25",
    ", we expect that observing a galaxy with a velocity larger than the escape velocity is unlikely .",
    "thus , we identify the escape velocity with the maximum velocity that can be observed .",
    "it follows that the amplitude @xmath26 at the projected radius @xmath31 measures the average component along the l.o.s . of the escape velocity at the three - dimensional radius @xmath32 . to determine this average component of the velocity",
    ", we consider the velocity anisotropy parameter @xmath33 , where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 are the longitudinal , azimuthal and radial components of the velocity @xmath37 of a galaxy , respectively , and the brackets indicate an average over the velocities of the galaxies in the volume @xmath38 centred on position @xmath39 . if the cluster rotation is negligible , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the l.o.s .",
    "component of the velocity , and @xmath42 . by substituting in the definition of @xmath12",
    ", we obtain @xmath43 where @xmath44 by applying this relation to the escape velocity at radius @xmath25 , @xmath45 , and assuming that @xmath46 , we obtain the fundamental relation between the gravitational potential @xmath29 and the observable caustic amplitude @xmath47 @xmath48 note that the gravitational potential profile is related to the caustic amplitude by the function @xmath49 . therefore , after the caustic amplitude estimation , @xmath12 becomes the only unknown function for the gravitational potential estimation .",
    "the further novel suggestion of dg97 is to use this relation to infer the cluster mass to very large radii .",
    "to do so , one first notices that the mass of an infinitesimal shell can be cast in the form @xmath50 where @xmath51 therefore the mass profile is @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : rig - massprof ] ) however only relates the mass profile to the density profile of a spherical system and a profile can not be inferred without knowing the other .",
    "dg97 solve this impasse by noticing that in hierarchical clustering scenarios , @xmath54 is not a strong function of @xmath25 .",
    "this is easily seen in the case of the nfw model which is an excellent description of dark matter density profiles in the hierarchical clustering scenario : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a scale factor .",
    "one expects that @xmath5 is also a slowly changing function of @xmath25 if @xmath49 is .",
    "dg97 and d99 show that this is the case , and here we confirm their result .",
    "the final , somewhat strong , assumption is then to consider @xmath57 altogether and adopt the recipe @xmath58    it is appropriate to emphasize that equations ( [ eq : rig - pot ] ) and ( [ eq : rig - massprof ] ) are rigorously correct , whereas equation ( [ eq : recipe - massprof ] ) is a heuristic recipe to estimate the mass profile .",
    "based on equation ( [ eq : rig - pot ] ) the caustic technique can also estimate a combination of the gravitational potential profile and velocity anisotropy parameter @xmath12 .",
    "below , we show the accuracy of these estimates .",
    "before analysing the systematic errors of the caustic technique , we need to check how well the physical assumptions of the method are satisfied .",
    "we do so by using @xmath13-body simulations , assuming that these simulations are a faithful representation of the real universe .    here we use the cluster sample extracted from the cosmological @xmath13-body / hydrodynamical simulation described in @xcite .",
    "they simulate a cubic volume , 192 @xmath59 mpc on a side , of a flat @xmath1cdm universe , with matter density @xmath60 , hubble parameter @xmath61 km s@xmath62 mpc@xmath62 with @xmath63 , power spectrum normalization @xmath64 , and baryon density @xmath65 . the density field is sampled with @xmath66 dark matter particles and an initially equal number of gas particles , with masses @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "the plummer - equivalent gravitational softening is set to 7.5 @xmath59 physical kpc at @xmath69 , while being fixed in comoving units at higher redshift .",
    "the simulation was run with gadget-2 @xcite , a massively parallel tree+sph code with fully adaptive time  stepping . besides standard hydrodynamics",

    "here we are only interested in the gravitational dynamics of the matter distribution .",
    "the simulation volume yields a cluster sample large enough for statistical purposes .",
    "we identify clusters in the simulation box with a two - step procedure : a friends - of - friends algorithm applied to the dark matter particles alone provides a list of halos whose centres are used as input to the spherical overdensity algorithm which outputs the final list of clusters @xcite .",

    "the nfw fit is on average very good also at radii larger than @xmath15 , although the scatter substantially increases . in the very centre",
    ", the nfw model underestimates the mass by 50 percent .",
    "this is due to the fact that the total mass includes dark matter , gas , and stars and in the simulation there is always a central galaxy which is unrealistically massive : the stellar particles , on average , contribute 50 ( 15 ) percent of the total mass within 0.02 ( 0.1 ) @xmath15 .",

    "this figure confirms the results of the @xmath1cdm model presented in figure 3 of d99 ( see also figure 25 in @xcite , which shows the velocity field of simulated galaxies rather than dark matter particles ) .",
    "specifically , figure [ fig : beta-4pan ] shows that , on average , @xmath107 at @xmath108 and consequently , on these scales , the median profile of @xmath49 varies by less than 30 percent .",
    "individual clusters may of course have wider variations .",
    "we remind that @xmath106 is derived from the velocities of all the particles in the simulations ( dark matter , gas and stars ) .",
    "these velocities are set in the rest frame of each cluster and are augmented of the hubble flow contribution @xmath109 .",
    "this term provides an increasing contribution to the particle velocity which is not negligible at @xmath110 .",
    "specifically , by assuming dynamical equilibrium and setting @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the average peculiar velocity at @xmath25 , we see that @xmath113 decreases with @xmath25 ; therefore , the total velocity @xmath114 reaches a minimum value when @xmath115 , viz .",

    "these methods assume dynamical equilibrium and the caustic measure can thus provide a robust consistency check of these estimates of @xmath106 within @xmath15 .",
    "@xcite have proposed a new approach , based on the spherical collapse model , to estimate the mass profile of galaxy clusters beyond their virial radius .",
    "the spherical collapse model poorly describes the formation of individual clusters in hierarchical clustering scenarios .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite s method seems to provide cluster masses with @xmath305 percent uncertainty on average , once the mean density of the universe @xmath147 is set and an appropriate subsample of galaxies is chosen based on their phase - space coordinates @xcite .",
    "in addition to the caustic method and the @xcite s technique , the only method available to estimate the mass of clusters beyond their virial radius is gravitational lensing . however , the lensing signal is strong enough only when the cluster is within the redshift range @xmath306 , whereas , in principle , the caustic technique can be applied to clusters at any redshift and it is only limited by the observing time required to measure a large enough number of galaxy spectra .",
    "the caustic technique relies on the assumption that randomly chosen galaxies are fair tracers of the velocity field , whereas gravitational lensing provides a direct measure of the projected mass distribution .",
    "all methods based on optical data relies on the absence of velocity bias between galaxies and dark matter , and both @xmath13-body simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicate that this assumption is indeed reasonable .",
    "selected galaxy samples do however have velocity biases : in fact , elliptical galaxies , disk galaxies , and galaxies showing signs of interactions can have substantially different velocity distributions both in observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in simulated clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the caustic technique estimates the escape velocity from a cluster .",
    "therefore , it can also be used to identify the galaxy members of the cluster .",
    "this argument is not limited to clusters , and the caustic technique was indeed applied to removing stellar interlopers in dwarf galaxies @xcite and the milky way stellar halo @xcite .",
    "the technique arranges the galaxies in the cluster field in a binary tree and a by - product of this analysis is the substructure identification .",
    "here , we have focussed on the estimate of the escape velocity and mass profiles of galaxy clusters .",
    "we will investigate the use of the caustic technique to identify members and substructure of self - gravitating systems in future work .    with the advent of the future generation of large spectroscopic surveys , both from ground ( e.g. , bigboss ) and from space ( e.g. , euclid ) , the application of the caustic technique can represent an extremely valuable tool to estimate mass profiles and galaxy membership over a large ensemble of galaxy clusters out to large radii from the cluster centre , thus providing important information on the cosmological assembly of dark matter halos and on the galaxy - environment connection .",

    "<S> the caustic technique uses galaxy redshifts alone to measure the escape velocity and mass profiles of galaxy clusters to clustrocentric distances well beyond the virial radius , where dynamical equilibrium does not necessarily hold . </S>",

    "<S> the caustic technique also recovers the mass profile with better than 10 percent accuracy in the range @xmath4 , but it overestimates the mass up to 70 percent at smaller radii . </S>",
    "<S> this overestimate is a consequence of neglecting the radial dependence of the filling function @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the 1-@xmath6 uncertainty on individual escape velocity profiles increases from @xmath7 to @xmath8 percent when the radius increases from @xmath9 to @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> individual mass profiles have 1-@xmath6 uncertainty between 40 and 80 percent within the radial range @xmath4 . when the correct virial mass is known , the 1-@xmath6 uncertainty reduces to a constant 50 percent on the same radial range . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the amplitude of these uncertainties is completely due to the assumption of spherical symmetry , which is difficult to drop . </S>",
    "<S> other potential refinements of the technique are not crucial . we conclude that , when applied to individual clusters , the caustic technique generally provides accurate escape velocity and mass profiles , although , in some cases , the deviation from the real profile can be substantial . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , we can apply the technique to synthetic clusters obtained by stacking individual clusters : in this case , the 1-@xmath6 uncertainty on the escape velocity profile is smaller than 20 percent out to @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the caustic technique thus provides reliable average profiles which extend to regions difficult or impossible to probe with other techniques .    </S>",
