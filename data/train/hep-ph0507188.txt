    "the most likely place for colour superconductivity is in the interior of compact stars .",
    "therefore , the phases of quark matter with appropriate conditions for the interior of compact stars ( i.e. neutrality conditions and @xmath0-equilibrium conditions ) has attracted a great deal of interest .",
    "the most striking feature of neutral and @xmath0-equilibrated colour - superconducting phases is the appearance of gapless colour superconductivity . in the case of a large strange quark mass , it has been revealed that the phase called gapless two - flavour colour - superconducting phase ( g2sc ) @xcite could appear as a ground state .",
    "similar analyses have been done for the case of three flavours and clarified that the gapless colour - flavour - locked ( cfl ) phase could also appear in neutral and @xmath0-equilibrated strange quark matter @xcite .",

    ", the phases of strangelets could be different from that of bulk strange quark matter .",
    "instead , we need to take into account finite - size effects explicitly in the study of strangelets . the properties of strangelets have been extensively studied by using various models with finite - size effects . in particular , madsen @xcite has shown that colour - flavour - locked strangelets are significantly more stable than unpaired ( normal ) strangelets , although the overall energy scale is still an open question because the bag constant is a phenomenological input parameter . in previous preliminary work @xcite",

    "one can see that the finite - size effects reduce the density of states and @xmath40 becomes negative at small momenta . to avoid the unphysical negative density of states we shall introduce an infrared cutoff @xmath41 in momentum space . for the case of @xmath42",

    "the mre density of states takes the form : @xmath46 then , we obtain @xmath47 . we have confirmed that @xmath41 behaves like @xmath48 in both cases .     for @xmath42 .",
    "we numerically solve the equation @xmath43 and adopt the right - most root as infrared cutoff @xmath41 . ]    using the density of states ( [ eqn : dos ] ) , we express the effective potential ( per unit volume ) of the spherical strangelets as follows    @xmath49    where @xmath50 are the quasiparticle energies of the unpaired ( blue up and blue down ) quarks , @xmath51 are those of the gapped ( red up , red down , green up , and green down ) quarks , and @xmath52 are those of strange quarks .",
    "we have also introduced the sign function @xmath53 , @xmath54 for @xmath55 or @xmath56 , and the following short - hand notation , @xmath57 notice that we used a common chemical potential @xmath58 for all nine quarks . in general , the matrix of quark chemical potentials for three - flavour quark systems can be written as @xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are generators of @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively . the indices @xmath66 and @xmath67 refer to flavour and colour , respectively .",

    "the former corresponds to unpaired ( normal ) strangelets and the latter to colour - superconducting strangelets .    in order to look at stable ( pressure balanced ) strangelets",
    ", we employ the usual pressure balance relation between ( the inside of ) a strangelet and the outer physical vacuum .",
    "the inside pressure @xmath77 can be defined by @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the dynamically generated quark masses and they are the nontrivial solutions to the following equations ,    @xmath83    @xmath84    of course , these equations can be derived from the extremum condition of the effective potential at @xmath85 . in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : pb ] ) , we have introduced the vacuum pressure ( or bag constant ) @xmath86 so as to measure the pressure relative to the outer vacuum .",
    "we emphasise that we do not need to introduce the bag constant by hand . in the njl model , the bag constant",
    "is generated dynamically .",
    "we first solve the gap equation [ eq .",
    "( [ eqn : sde ] ) ] and pressure balance relation @xmath87 [ eq .",
    "( [ eqn : pb ] ) ] self - consistently .",
    "then , the baryon number @xmath88 of the stable strangelet is computed by using the following relation @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the volume of the spherical strangelet and @xmath91 is the baryon number density .",
    "the baryon number density , which is one third of the quark number density @xmath92 , is obtained by taking the partial derivative of @xmath72 : @xmath93 + \\frac{\\epsilon_{+}}{e_{+}}\\left[1 - 2n_f(e_{+})\\right ] + \\frac{3}{2}\\left[n_f(\\varepsilon_{-})-n_f(\\varepsilon_{+})\\right]\\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath94 is the fermi distribution function .",
    "having solved the above three equations self - consistently , we can find stable colour - superconducting strangelets ( i.e. @xmath88 dependence of @xmath73 , @xmath58 and @xmath31 ) .",
    "we can also compute other thermodynamic quantities .",
    "the most important , perhaps , is the energy per baryon number @xmath95 of strangelets : @xmath96 where the energy density @xmath97 is given by @xmath98 here @xmath99 is the number density of quark flavour @xmath100 that satisfy the relation @xmath101 . by virtue of the common chemical potential @xmath58 and the pressure balance relation ,",
    "one can see that the following relation holds : @xmath102",
    "in this section we focus on strangelets at zero temperature and present numerical results . before proceeding to the results , we give a brief survey of the finite - size effects .",
    "suppose a finite - size quark droplet embedded in the physical vacuum .",
    "it is generally known that the finite - size quark droplet is energetically disfavoured as compared to quark matter in bulk . in other words ,",
    "the finite - size effects increase the quark chemical potential .",
    "hence , our results show a size dependence ( i.e. baryon number dependence ) .",
    "let us start with the baryon number dependence of the 2sc gap ( see fig .",
    "we present the results for the cases @xmath103 and @xmath104 gev , for comparison .",
    "it is clear that , for relatively large baryon numbers ( @xmath105 ) , the gap remains approximately constant .",
    "the result indicates that finite - size effects becomes less important for large baryon numbers ( i.e. large radii ) , as they should .",
    "the difference in the size of the gap between the case @xmath103 and @xmath104 gev is the result of the difference in the chemical potentials of the gapped quarks . at fixed @xmath88 , the effect of @xmath106",
    "is to increase the chemical potentials of up and down quarks .",
    "consequently , the gap grows with @xmath106 .",
    "in contrast , the curves behave differently at small baryon numbers ( @xmath107 ) . in the case of @xmath104 gev , as @xmath88 is decreased the gap decreases .",
    "the decrease of the gap is caused by the fact that the chemical potentials of gapped quarks are increased by finite - size effects and , then , they are close to the uv cutoff ( see fig .",
    "3 ) .    in the case of @xmath103 ,",
    "the behaviour of the gap at small baryon numbers is also due to the finite - size effects .",
    "however , the chemical potentials of the gapped quarks are not close to the uv cutoff ( fig .",
    "3 ) . as @xmath88",
    "is decreased , the chemical potentials of gapped quarks are increased by the finite - size effects . hence the gap grows with decreasing @xmath88 . as @xmath88",
    "is further decreased the gap reaches a peak and , finally , drops .",
    "the decrease of the gap at very small baryon numbers ( @xmath108 ) arises from the fact that the density of states near the fermi surface is decreased by the ir cutoff .",
    "figure 4 shows energy per baryon number @xmath95 of 2sc strangelets as a function of @xmath88 .",
    "the strange quark masses are set to @xmath104 gev .",
    "we also present the results for the cases of strong diquark coupling ( @xmath109 ) and unpaired strangelets .",
    "it appears that 2sc strangelets are more stable than unpaired strangelets and the strong diquark coupling significantly stabilises 2sc strangelets .",
    "the results can be easily understood as follows . in the 2sc phase , the pairing energy contribution to the thermodynamic potential",
    "is roughly given by ( volume term only ) @xmath110 that is the product of the pairing energy and the number density of gapped quarks near the fermi surface @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is quite reasonable that 2sc strangelets are more stable than unpaired strangelets .",
    "it is also natural that the strong diquark coupling ( i.e. large paring energy ) makes 2sc strangelets energetically more favoured . for small @xmath88",
    "the energy per baryon number increases dramatically because of the growth of the chemical potential by the finite - size effects .    to examine @xmath95 of various phases",
    "we compute @xmath95 for unpaired , 2sc , and cfl strangelets as a function of @xmath88 .",
    "( see fig .",
    "the curve for cfl strangelets is taken from ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the diquark coupling and the strange quark mass are taken to be @xmath23 and @xmath103 , respectively .",
    "the pairing energy in the cfl phase takes the following form @xcite : @xmath111 hence the pairing energy contribution to the thermodynamic potential in the cfl phase is larger than that in the 2sc phase because all nine quarks participate in cooper pairing .",
    "as one would expect , cfl strangelets are more stable than 2sc strangelets . in general , however , we need to include nonvanishing @xmath106 and study the competition of 2sc and cfl phases in detail .",
    "it is interesting to look at the strangeness fraction of 2sc strangelets in the light of their production in laboratories .",
    "the strangeness fraction @xmath112 is given by @xmath113 the fraction for unpaired strangelets should satisfy @xmath114 at @xmath103 .",
    "figure 6 shows the strangeness fraction of 2sc strangelets for the cases of @xmath103 , @xmath104 gev , and @xmath115 gev .",
    "the diquark coupling is taken to be @xmath23 .",
    "the fraction deviates from @xmath114 even in the case of @xmath103 .",
    "this deviation can be understood as follows .",
    "the number density of an unpaired quark is given by @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the occupation number for a noninteracting massless quark .",
    "on the other hand , the number density of a gapped quark is given by @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the occupation number of a gapped quark .",
    "one can easily check that the relation @xmath120 holds .",
    "hence , the number of gapped quarks increases in the 2sc phase and the relation @xmath121 holds even in the case of @xmath103 . for the cases of massive strange quark ,",
    "the fraction decreases further because the fermi momentum of strange quarks , @xmath122 , decreases due to the mass gap .",
    "one may argue that @xmath112 is reduced further if one takes into account the dynamically generated mass of the strange quark .",
    "however , it has been shown that the finite - size effects enhance the restoration of chiral symmetry @xcite .",
    "therefore , at present , the effect of the dynamical strange quark mass is an open question .",
    "the strangeness fraction in cfl strangelets is , presumably , larger than that of 2sc strangelets , because cfl pairing enforces the equal fermi momenta for all quarks .",
    "the complete calculation including dynamical quark masses is an interesting problem to be investigated in future work .",
    "figure 7 shows the densities achieved in 2sc strangelets as a function of @xmath88 .",
    "2sc strangelets with massive ( @xmath104 gev ) strange quarks have higher densities than that with massless strange quarks .",
    "this is understood by considering that nonzero @xmath106 gives a contribution to the pressure .",
    "the leading - order contribution from nonvanishing @xmath106 is roughly given by ( volume term only ) @xmath123 comparing the cases of @xmath103 and @xmath104 gev , we have confirmed that @xmath124 overpowers the small difference of @xmath125 .",
    "then 2sc strangelets with massive strange quarks require larger chemical potentials to maintain the pressure balance and , therefore , have larger density than that with massless strange quarks .",
    "inversely , the radii of strangelets behave as shown in fig .",
    "the size of 2sc strangelets at very small baryon numbers ( @xmath126 ) is around 12 fm .",
    "the size is comparable with the coherence length of the cooper pair @xmath127 .",
    "then , it is uncertain whether the cooper pair exists in such a small system or not . in these regions",
    ", mode - filling calculations may be available @xcite .     as a function of baryon number @xmath88 for the cases of @xmath103 and @xmath104 gev .",
    "the diquark coupling is taken to be @xmath23 . ]     of the pressure balanced 2sc strangelets as a function of baryon number @xmath88 .",

    "both curves behave like @xmath131 . ]",
    "in summary , we studied the properties of two - flavour colour - superconducting strangelets .",
    "we used the nambu  jona - lasinio model to describe colour superconductivity and the multiple reflection expansion to take account of finite - size effects .",
    "we formulated the thermodynamic potential for 2sc strangelets including finite - size effects in terms of the mre density of states .",
    "we then solved the set of coupled equations ; the gap equation , the pressure balance relation and the baryon number condition .",
    "we found that a sizable 2sc gap survives in small strangelets ( @xmath132 ) though its behaviour at small baryon numbers depends on the strange quark mass .",
    "we also found that 2sc strangelets are more stable than unpaired strangelets due to the pairing energy .",
    "it should be noted here that 2sc strangelets are not absolutely stable as compared to a gas of @xmath3fe .",
    "we did not examine the competition with other possible phases ( e.g. colour - flavour - locked phase , chirally broken phase , and so on ) .",
    "we would like to make a comment on the sensitivity of the results to model parameters .",
    "using several sets of parameters , we examined the sensitivity of our results .",
    "we found that the results do not change much with the choice of @xmath133 and @xmath13 , as long as they are fixed by fitting physical quantities at @xmath85 . rather than @xmath133 and @xmath13",
    ", the diquark coupling has an effect on the results . a large diquark coupling yields a large 2sc gap and reduces the strangeness fraction . for instance",
    ", the strangeness fraction decreases to @xmath134 at @xmath104 gev and @xmath135 due to the large 2sc gap ( @xmath136 gev ) .",
    "however , such a strong coupling may induce the fluctuation of pairing field and , then , invalidate the present description of the 2sc phase .",
    "the mre has problems concerning its reliability .",
    "first , @xmath40 should have terms proportional to @xmath137 , @xmath138 and so on .",
    "they are dominant at small radii .",
    "further , the mre causes a negative density of states .",
    "although we simply avoided the latter problem by introducing an infrared cutoff , these problems should be solved in the future .",
    "however , for relatively large systems ( @xmath105 ) , these problems have rather minor effects and the results presented in this paper would hold .    finally , we comment on the outlook for future studies .",
    "it is very interesting to study the competition with other phases , taking account of the realistic value of the strange quark mass . in particular , inclusion of the chirally broken phase and",
    "the colour - flavour - locked phase would affect the present analysis .",
    "it would be also interesting to examine colour - superconducting strangelets embedded in the vacuum at finite temperature and/or density .",
