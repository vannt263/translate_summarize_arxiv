    "molecular clouds are the principal sites of star formation , as localised dense regions of gas and dust within a cold turbulent cloud collapse under gravity to form stars and stellar clusters .",
    "these highly supersonic clouds are typically tens of parsecs across , reaching masses of up to 10@xmath0 m@xmath1 in the milky way . in order to reach a greater understanding of how stars form and evolve ,",
    "a logical first step is to explore the large - scale structure and dynamics of molecular clouds .",
    "one approach is to characterise molecular clouds based on their large - scale properties : mass , size , and velocity dispersion . for the past thirty years",
    ", the three scaling relations presented in @xcite , commonly called larson s laws , have been used to link these properties .",
    "larson found an empirical relation between the velocity dispersion and size of molecular clouds such that @xmath2 = 1.1 l@xmath3 where @xmath2 is the three - dimensional internal velocity dispersion in km s@xmath4 and l is the maximum linear dimension in pc .",
    "@xcite used a large sample of @xmath5co observations of molecular clouds to find a similar size - linewidth relation of @xmath6 = ( 1.0 @xmath7 0.1 ) s@xmath8 where @xmath6 is the one - dimensional velocity dispersion in km s@xmath4 and s is a measure of the cloud size in pc .",
    "although their results are consistent with larson s , they do find a steeper power - law index of 0.5 which the authors argue is a consequence of clouds in virial equilibrium rather than due to a kolmogorov turbulent spectrum , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "this interpretation by @xcite is also consistent with larson s second conclusion that molecular clouds are gravitationally bound and in approximate virial equilibrium .",
    "the virial state of a cloud is often expressed using the virial parameter , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) where @xmath6 is the one - dimensional velocity dispersion along the line of sight , r is the maximum projected radius , and m is the total mass of the cloud .",
    "the virial parameter describes simple virial equilibrium which excludes effects of magnetic fields and external pressure .",
    "spherical , homogeneous clouds are virialised when @xmath9 = 1 and gravitationally bound if @xmath9 @xmath11 2 .",
    "larson s third scaling relation proposed that molecular clouds have approximately the same column density on all size scales ; however , this conclusion was based on a sample with a limited range of column densities , which was the best achievable by observations at the time . if molecular clouds are assumed to be in gravitational equilibrium with a constant column density , then the size - linewidth relation naturally follows , implying the universality of molecular cloud structure and turbulence .",
    "although all three of larson s scaling relationships are frequently used to define the characteristics of molecular clouds , there are often large amounts of scatter accompanying each trend , which varies in many cases by over two orders of magnitude ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the scaling relations are often the focus of study while the scatter itself is readily dismissed .",
    "whether this scatter is physically meaningful or a product of observational uncertainty is a subject which is explored throughout this work and also most notably in an influential study by @xcite involving a re - examination of the @xcite cloud sample using @xmath12co observations with greater sensitivity and higher spectral and angular resolution .",
    "their results showed that the cloud column density is not constant , as confirmed in later studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and that the scatter present in their size - linewidth relation is reduced when the scaling coefficient depends on the cloud mass surface density , @xmath13 . the size - linewidth scaling coefficient , defined by @xcite as @xmath14 indicates that clouds inhabit a one - dimensional space parameterized by surface density .",
    "@xcite suggested that the dependence of the size - linewidth coefficient , @xmath15 , on the surface density may not have been realized previously due to the limited range of column densities which could be probed in early observations of molecular clouds .",
    "the authors also note that scatter , while reduced , is still present in their data for the size - linewidth coefficient vs. the surface density .",
    "a number of possible explanations for the cause of this remaining scatter have been proposed .",
    "@xcite suggested that different interstellar magnetic field strengths and varying flux - to - mass ratios could produce the observed trend and scatter since the relation is consistent with models of magnetically - supported molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "however , since the magnetic field strengths are unknown for this sample of molecular clouds , this can not be confirmed by current observations .",
    "alternatively , @xcite found that the data of @xcite can be accounted for by using different external pressure values for clouds in pressure - bounded virial equilibrium ; however , the range of values necessary to reproduce the observed trend extends much higher than current estimates for pressures present in the neutral ism @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue that neither magnetic support nor pressure confinement are required to explain the relation and scatter as the data are simply consistent with clouds undergoing hierarchical and chaotic gravitational collapse .",
    "molecular clouds would have localised collapsing regions within a globally bound turbulent cloud , but these regions may not necessarily be virialised at all stages throughout their evolution .",
    "although @xcite find that most of the clouds in their sample are super - virial , they remark that their derived cloud masses could have been underestimated by a factor of 2  3 .",
    "however , @xcite showed that even after doubling the cloud masses , most of the clouds in the @xcite sample are not virialised with 50% of the clouds strictly unbound with @xmath9 @xmath16 2 in contrast to the common assumption of bound clouds .",
    "the dependence of the size - linewidth coefficient on the mass surface density is expected from the definition of the virial parameter for clouds assumed to be gravitationally bound and virialised ( @xmath9 = 1 ) . however , there is considerable scatter present and the most direct interpretation of this scatter implies unbound clouds , @xmath17 .",
    "molecular clouds which are unbound as a whole can contain dense gravitationally bound subregions within them , such as clumps and cores , initially formed by supersonic turbulent motions and maintained by their own self - gravity . whether or not molecular clouds can be truly unbound and still consistent with observations is the primary focus of this work .",
    "simulators have begun to explore the possibility that molecular clouds are unbound .",
    "recent simulations @xcite have shown that unbound clouds can result in localised and distributed star formation and produce naturally low star formation efficiencies .",
    "@xcite explored the formation of molecular clouds through galaxy - scale simulations .",
    "their simulated clouds were able to remain unbound , which the authors attributed to cloud - cloud collisions and stellar feedback .",
    "they produce molecular clouds with a wide range of virial parameters ; however , they were not able to follow internal structure or dynamics in the clouds",
    ". furthermore , their resolution prevents them from probing more typical cloud masses ( @xmath18 10@xmath19 m@xmath1 ) such as those in the @xcite sample .",
    "our simulations have been designed to avoid potential biases associated with assuming molecular clouds are initially bound , that they have a preferred surface density , or other assumptions that predispose them to collapse and star formation .",
    "we produced a set of 16 high resolution simulations , with properties listed in table  [ table : initcondit ] , that cover a broad range of initial column densities and turbulent velocities .",
    "our simulations evolve to form local regions with surface densities typical of observed molecular clouds . unlike most other studies",
    ", the clouds also contain large - scale turbulent motions so they do not collapse spherically . in this paper , we present properties of these clouds as they would be observed . to create a sample of synthetic observations at various stages of evolution",
    ", we selected localised dense turbulent regions analogous to low - mass clouds , such as the taurus molecular cloud ( 1.5 @xmath20 10@xmath21 m@xmath1 ; * ? ? ? * ) and the perseus molecular cloud ( 7 @xmath20 10@xmath22 m@xmath1 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we demonstrate the ability of these clouds to form stars , and we offer a simple explanation for the scatter present in the @xmath15-@xmath13 relation .    in section  [ sec :",
    "sim ] , we describe the details of our suite of simulations followed by a description of our cloud selection criteria and methods of analysis in section  [ sec : sample ] .",
    "we present our results and explore the effect of boundedness on the determination of cloud properties in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code , gasoline @xcite , we ran sixteen simulations of a 50 000 m@xmath1 region of the ism which include the effects of decaying initial turbulence and gravity .",
    "this allows us to study the dynamics and evolution of molecular clouds without the additional complications of magnetic fields , variable external pressure , or stellar feedback .",
    "the simulations use the same equation of state and open boundary conditions as those described in @xcite .",
    "since our equation of state from @xcite has an opacity limit for fragmentation of 10@xmath23 g @xmath24 much higher than our maximum gas density , our entire simulations are optically thin and isothermal at 10 k. each run is simulated using approximately 5.5 million particles , resulting in one of the most massive and highly resolved simulations of an isolated cloud currently achieved , with a mass resolution of 8.85 @xmath20 10@xmath25 m@xmath1 per particle .",
    "we used a burgers turbulent velocity spectrum characterised by three eigenvectors of the symmetric shear tensor , where material along one axis expanded outward , material along another axis collapsed inward , and the third dimension remained static .",
    "we refer to this type of anisotropic collapse as the ` ribbon ' collapse case @xcite , which was determined by @xcite through a statistical study of the anisotropy of cloud collapse to be the most likely scenario to be observed in nature , assuming that all molecular clouds have random turbulence on large - scales .",
    "our simulations include turbulent modes larger than the scale of the cloud to account for large - scale effects .",
    "the resultant flow structure has some similarities with that of a cloud formed from a colliding flow .",
    "it also has a very filamentary structure which is in agreement with current observations of molecular clouds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in order to avoid the high computational costs of simulating such a large range of densities typical of observed clouds , the highest density regions ( @xmath16 10@xmath0 atoms @xmath24 ) were replaced by sink particles with the requirement that these regions were at a potential minimum and were gravitationally bound ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "the simulations are run until a maximum of 35% in mass of the gas is converted to stars . since several of our runs are initially unbound , the mass fraction in stars is not directly coupled to the free - fall time , resulting in different absolute stopping times for each run .",
    "however , each simulation was run until t = 0.5 t@xmath26 at the very least , where t@xmath26 = 1/@xmath27",
    ".    the initial conditions of our simulations were chosen such as to have initial physical virial parameters ranging from @xmath28 = 1 ( bound and virialised ) to @xmath28 = 10 ( highly unbound ) .",
    "this was achieved using a range of densities , n@xmath29 , and velocity dispersions , @xmath30 , listed in table  [ table : initcondit ] , resulting in column densities between 1  7 @xmath20 10@xmath31 @xmath32 . for comparison , observed molecular clouds have a mean extinction of a@xmath33 @xmath34 1 which corresponds to a column density of @xmath35 10@xmath31 @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "although infrared dark clouds can reach column densities of @xmath35 10@xmath36 @xmath32 @xcite , near - infrared dust extinction data for molecular clouds can only probe to a maximum column density of @xmath35 25 @xmath20 10@xmath31 @xmath32 due to the observational limitations of this method ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "our simulations of the 50 000 m@xmath1 region of the ism evolve under gravity and turbulence to form molecular clouds with masses ranging from @xmath35 300 to 10 000 m@xmath1 .",
    "detailed properties of these clouds and the process by which they were selected are provided in section  [ sec : sample ] .",
    ".initial conditions for the simulations [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : initcondit ]",
    "in order to compare the results of the simulations with observations , we have created a synthetic two - dimensional column density map for each of the sixteen cases using the method described in @xcite .",
    "our column density maps were produced from the simulation by interpolating the sph particles to a 4000 x 4000 grid , where the spatial resolution is 6000 au per pixel .",
    "the sph kernel function @xcite is used to smooth each particle over several grid cells and is weighted to ensure normalization of the total mass in the map .",
    "a sample synthetic column density map is shown in figure [ fg : synobscomplex ] .",
    "we can assume that the column density of material in our maps is a direct analogue of extinction measurements or of the observed flux from @xmath12co observations since our gas is optically thin for the duration of each simulation .",
    "the cloud sample was created by examining each simulation at 1 myr intervals for a total of 122 snapshots .",
    "individual clouds typically appear at around 1/4 of a free - fall time and sinks , representing a star or small groups of stars , begin to form at a similar time .",
    "the sample therefore represents molecular clouds at many different stages of evolution .",
    "figure  [ fg : contourmap ] demonstrates the method of cloud selection .",
    "we temporarily smoothed our maps to 1 pc spatial resolution using a gaussian filter to emphasise the large - scale structure .",
    "this spatial resolution was chosen to be similar to the best resolution of the nearby molecular cloud observations by @xcite and our selection process is intended to mimic theirs .",
    "the grey contour lines mark the minimum possible column density , @xmath37 @xmath34 0.5 @xmath20 10@xmath31 @xmath32 , that can be detected from dust extinction measurements @xcite . to be considered a cloud ,",
    "the extended emission above the white contour lines , which have a minimum threshold of 3@xmath37 and contour intervals of 3@xmath37 , must be contiguous with box dimensions greater than 3 pc across , where the size threshold distinguishes clouds from smaller star - forming clumps @xcite .",
    "these newly - identified clouds were extracted from the simulations using a box size defined by the contour threshold in order to isolate and study local regions within the simulations .",
    "this selection allows for a more direct comparison with clouds like the taurus molecular cloud and the pipe nebula .",

    "to ensure that the simulated molecular clouds are consistent with real molecular clouds , we compared properties determined from our synthetic column density maps to those measured in observations . for the clouds in our sample , we only included pixels above a minimum column density threshold of 0.5@xmath2010@xmath31 @xmath32 in our determination of the mass , size , and linewidth .",
    "this column density threshold corresponds to the lower limit for detection in extinction maps ( a@xmath33 @xmath35 0.5 ; * ? ? ? * ) which also coincides with the threshold for self - shielding against uv feedback leading to the formation of molecular clouds .",

    "therefore , provided that we can measure the size and linewidth of a molecular cloud , we can solve for the virial parameter , @xmath9 , and its mass , assuming a functional dependence of the column density on the chosen threshold ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "localised regions of compression due to turbulence within unbound clouds lead to isolated regions of star formation as the clouds disperse and their column density fades beneath the lower limit for detection .",

    "if molecular clouds are unbound , this allows for relatively low star formation rates for individual clouds , matching those seen in observations .",
