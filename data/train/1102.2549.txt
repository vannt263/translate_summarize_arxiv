    "it is well known that quantum entanglement @xcite , is a distinctive quantum feature of quantum correlations , but not the only one . in order to capture nonclassical correlations , several measures of correlations",
    "have been proposed in the literature @xcite . among them , quantum discord ( qd ) has received considerable attention @xcite , which quantifies the quantumness of correlations between two partitions in a composite state @xcite .",
    "the qd , which measures general nonclassical correlations including entanglement , is defined as the mismatch between two quantum analogues of classically equivalent expression of the mutual information . for pure entangled states ,",
    "all nonclassical correlations which can be characterized by the qd are identified as entanglement .",
    "for mixed states , the entanglement can not totally describe nonclassical correlation . even for some separable states , although there is no entanglement between these two parts , the qd is nonzero , which indicates the presence of nonclassical correlations . and compared to classical counterparts , such separable states can also improve performance in some computational tasks @xcite .",
    "in fact , nonclassical correlation described by the qd can be considered as a more universal quantum resource than quantum entanglement in some sense , and the qd offers new prospects for quantum information processing .    any realistic quantum system will inevitably interact with the surrounding environment , which causes the rapid destruction of crucial quantum properties . therefore , besides the characterization and quantification of correlations , an interesting and crucial issue is the behavior of correlations under decoherence .",
    "the qd dynamics have been widely studied by using models where qubits interacts in zero - temperature reservoirs @xcite . moreover ,",
    "qd is more robust than the entanglement against decoherence @xcite .",
    "also , unlike the entanglement , which exhibits sudden death  @xcite , the qd displays the sudden - transition phenomenon from a decoherence - free - evolution ( dfe ) to a decoherence - evolution regime in the dynamic evolution @xcite , and the inital qd remains unchanged in the dfe regime .",
    "the this sudden - change phenomenon have been demonstrated in recent experiments @xcite .",
    "it is of significant interest to prolong the dfe time of the qd in quantum information science since quantum information processing favors the long dfe time of the qd in the dynamic evolution . in this paper",
    ", we study the possibility of prolonging the dfe time of the qd by investigating the dfe dynamics of initially - correlated two qubits in two finite - temperature reservoirs",
