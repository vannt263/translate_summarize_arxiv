    "ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) showers ( from pevs up to eevs and above , mainly of hadronic nature ) born at the high altitude in the atmosphere , may blaze ( from the far edge ) _ above the horizon _ toward telescopes such as magic one . the earliest gamma and cerenkov lights produced while they propagate through the atmosphere are partially absorbed because of the deep horizontal atmosphere column depth ( @xmath7 up to @xmath8 @xmath9 ) , must anyway survive and also revive : indeed additional diluted but penetrating muon bundles ( from the same by c.r .",
    "shower ) are decaying not far from the telescope into electrons which are source themselves of small air - showers and cerenkov lights .",
    "direct muons hitting the telescope may blaze a ring or an arc of lights .",
    "these muon bundle secondaries , about @xmath10 times less abundant than the peak of the gamma shower photons are arising at high altitude , at an horizontal distances @xmath11 km far from the observer ( for a zenith angle @xmath12 while at 2.2 km .",
    "height ) ; therefore their hard ( tens - hundred gev ) muon shower bundles ( from ten to millions muons at tevs - eevs c.r .",
    "energy primary ) might spread in huge areas ( up to tens- hundred @xmath13 ) ; they are marginally bent by geo - magnetic fields and they are randomly scattered , often decaying at hundred - tens gev energies , into electrons pairs ; their consequent mini electromagnetic - showers are traced by their optical cerenkov flashes .",
    "these diluted ( but spread and therefore better detectable ) brief ( nanosecond - microsecond ) optical signals may be captured as a light cluster by largest telescope on ground as recent stereoscopic magic , hess , veritas arrays .",
    "cerenkov flashes , single or clustered , must take place , at detection threshold , at least at a rate of hundreds events a night for magic - like telescope facing horizons at zenith angle @xmath14 .",
    "their `` guaranteed '' discover may offer a new gauge in cr and uhecr detection .",
    "their primary hadronic signature might be partially hidden by the deep column depth distance , leading to few narrow clustered and ( possibly ) slitted ( by geomagnetic field ) dots ; however sometime there is an additional and conclusive trace offered by the same air - shower secondary muon - electron cerenkov flashes in flight blazing the telescope . on the same time and with the similar behaviour",
    "_ below the horizons _ a more rare ( three - four order of magnitude ) but even more exciting pev - eevs neutrino @xmath15 astronomy may arise by the earth - skimming horizontal tau air - showers ( hortaus and uptaus ) @xcite ; these uhe taus are produced inside the earth crust by the primary uhe incoming neutrino @xmath16 , @xmath17 , neutrinos generated mainly by their muon - tau neutrino oscillations from galactic or cosmic sources,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite . above or below the horizon edge , within a few hundred of km distances , horizontal showers could reveal the guaranteed tuned @xmath18-@xmath19 air - showers at @xmath20 glashow resonant peak energy ; the @xmath21 main hadronic ( @xmath22 ) or leptonic and electromagnetic ( @xmath23 ) signatures may be well observed ( within tens - hundred km distance ) and their rate might calibrate a new horizontal neutrino - multi - flavour astronomy @xcite .",
    "the @xmath18-@xmath19 of nearby nature ( respect to most far away ones at same zenith angle of hadronic nature ) would be better revealed by a stereoscopic magic twin telescope or a telescope array like hess , veritas .",
    "additional horizontal flashes might arise by cosmic uhe @xmath24 electromagnetic showers within most susy models , if uhecr are born in topological defect decay or in their annihilation , ejecting a relevant component of susy particles .",
    "the uhe @xmath24 behaves ( for light @xmath25 masses around z boson ones ) as the glashow resonant case @xcite .",
    "finally similar signals might be abundantly and better observed if uhe neutrinos share new extra - dimension ( tev gravity ) interactions : in this case also neutrino - nucleons interaction may be an abundant source of pevs - eevs horizontal showers originated in air @xcite .",
    "the total amount of air inspected within the solid angle @xmath26 by magic height at horizons ( @xmath27 km . ) exceed @xmath28 but their consequent detectable beamed volume are corresponding to an isotropic narrower volume : v@xmath29 @xmath30 , nevertheless comparable ( for pevs @xmath18-@xmath19 and eevs @xmath16 , @xmath31 showers ) to the present amanda confident volume . moreover monitoring a defined source ( like crab , agn , bl lac , grbs , sgrs , possibly a micro - quasar jet and snrs ) at its dawn or rise , the horizontal interposed conical air volume @xmath32 exceed the @xmath30 water mass , making such horizontal showering astronomy ( by magic - like telescopes ) already the most sensitive neutrino detector .",
    "moreover while looking at the earth edges the neutrino magic telescope monitor a wider and denser earth crust volume comparable to nearly @xmath33 @xmath30 w.e .",
    "mass ( at eev energy ) and twice less at few hundred pevs , making it the most effective high energy neutrino telescope available at the moment .    .",

    "the ultrahigh energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) have been studied in the past mainly versus their secondaries ( @xmath2 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) collected vertically in large array detectors on the ground .",
    "this is due to the rare event rate of the uhecr in the atmosphere and due to the high altitude where the shower takes place , expand and amplify downward . on the contrary at the horizons the uhecr are hardly observable ( but also rarely looked for ) .",
    "they are diluted both by the larger distances as well as by the exponential atmosphere opacity suppressing the electromagnetic ( electron pairs and gamma ) secondaries ; also their rich optical cerenkov signal is partially suppressed by the horizontal air opacity .",
    "however this suppression acts also as an useful filter leading to the higher cr events ; their cerenkov lights will be scatter and partially transmitted ( around @xmath36 zenith angle by a factor @xmath37 at @xmath38 nm .",
    ", @xmath39 at @xmath40 nm . ) depending on the exact zenith angle and seeing : assuming on average a suppression @xmath41 and the nominal magic energy threshold at @xmath42 gev , it does corresponds to a hadronic shower at far horizons ( diluted by nearly three order of magnitude by larger distances ) at energy above @xmath43 pev .",
    "their primary flux may be estimated considering the known cosmic ray on the top of the atmosphere ( both protons or helium ) ( see dice experiment referred in@xcite ) : @xmath44 . within a shower cerenkov angle @xmath45 at a distance @xmath46 ( zenith angle @xmath47 ) the shower surface corresponds to a wide area : @xmath48 $ ] , observed within an opening angle @xmath49 $ ] ; the consequent event rate time a night of record ( @xmath50 $ ] ) by magic is @xmath51 .",
    "therefore one may foresee nearly every two minutes a far hadronic cerenkov lightening shower in magic facing at the far horizons at zenith angle @xmath52 . increasing the observer altitude h , the allowable horizon zenith angle also grows : @xmath53 $ ] in analogy at a more distant horizontal edges ( standing at height @xmath54 as for magic , while observing at zenith angle @xmath55 still above the horizons ) the observation range @xmath56 increases : @xmath57 ; the consequent shower area widen by more than an order of magnitude ( and more than three order respect to vertical showers ) and the consequent foreseen event number , now for a much harder penetrating c.r .",
    "shower at @xmath58 , becomes : @xmath59 therefore at the far edges of the horizons @xmath60 , once a night , an uhecr around eev energies , may blaze to the magic ( or hess , veritas , telescope arrays ) . at each of these far primary cherenkov flash",
    "is associated a long tail of secondary muons in a very huge area ; these muons eventually are also hitting inside the telescope disk ; their nearby showering in air , while decaying into electrons in flight , ( source of electromagnetic mini - gamma showers of tens - hundred gevs energy ) is also detectable at a rate discussed below .",
    "as already noted the main shower blazing photons from a cr may be also regenerated or aided by its secondary tens - hundred gevs muons , either decaying in flight as a gamma flashes , or directly painting cerenkov arcs or rings while hitting the telescope .",
    "indeed these secondary penetrating muon bundles may reach hundreds km distances ( @xmath62 ) far away from the shower origin . to be more precise",
    "a part of the muon primary energy will dissipate along @xmath27 km air - flight ( nearly a hundred gev energy ) , but a primary @xmath63 gev muon will survive at final @xmath64 gev energy , at minimal magic threshold value .",
    "let us remind the characteristic secondary abundance in a shower : @xmath65 .",
    "these secondaries are mostly at a minimal ( gev ) energies @xcite ; for the harder ( a hundred gev ) muons their number is ( almost inversely proportionally to energy ) reduced : @xmath66 these values must be compared with the larger peak multiplicity ( but much lower energy ) of electro - magnetic shower nature : @xmath67 .",
    "as mentioned most of these electromagnetic tail is lost ( exponentially ) at horizons ( above slant depth of a few hundreds of @xmath68)(out of the case of re - born , upgoing @xmath69 air - showers @xcite,@xcite ) ; therefore gamma - electron pairs are only partially regenerated by the penetrating muon decay in flight , @xmath70 as a parasite electromagnetic showering @xcite . indeed @xmath71 may decay in flight ( let say at @xmath72 gev energy , at @xmath73 level within a @xmath74 km distances ) and they may inject more and more lights , to their primary ( far born ) shower beam .",
    "these tens - hundred gevs horizontal muons and their associated mini - cerenkov @xmath2 showers have two main origin : ( 1 ) either a single muon mostly produced at hundreds km distance by a single ( hundreds gev - tev parental ) c.r .",
    "hadron : this is a very dominant component ; ( 2 ) a shower by rarer muon , part of a wider and spread horizontal muon bundle of large multiplicity born at tevs - pev or higher energies .",
    "a whole continuous spectrum of multiplicity begins from an unique muon up to a multi muon shower production .",
    "the dominant noisy `` single '' muons at hundred - gev energies will loose memory of the primary low energy and hidden mini - shower , ( a hundreds gev or tevs hadrons ) ; a single muon will blaze just alone .",
    "the muon `` single '' rings or arcs frequency is larger ( than muon bundles ones ) and it is based on solid observational data ( @xcite ; @xcite , as shown in fig.2 and references on mutron experiment therein ) ; these `` noise '' event number is : @xmath75 the additional gamma mini - showers around the telescope due to a decay ( at a probability @xmath76 ) of those muons in flight , recorded within a larger collecting area @xmath77 is even a more frequent ( by a factor @xmath78 ) noisy signal : @xmath79 . these single background",
    "gamma - showers must take place nearly once a minute ( in an silent hadronic background ) and they are an useful tool to be used as a meter of the horizontal c.r . verification .    on the contrary pevs ( or higher energy ) cr shower cerenkov lights",
    "may be observed , more rarely , in coincidence both by their primary and by their later secondary arc and gamma mini - shower .",
    "their @xmath80 gev energetic muons are flying nearly undeflected @xmath81 for a characteristic horizons distances d , partially bent by geo - magnetic @xmath82 gauss fields ; as mentioned , to flight through the whole horizontal air column depth ( @xmath27 km equivalent to @xmath27 water depth ) the muon lose nearly @xmath72 gev ; consequently the origination muon energy should be a little above this threshold to be observed by magic : ( at least @xmath83 gev along most of the flights ) .",
    "the deflection angle is therefore a small one : ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "magic telescope area ( @xmath85 ) may record at first approximation the following event number of direct muon hitting the telescope , flashing as rings and arcs , each night : @xmath86 to be correlated ( at @xmath87 probability ) with the above results of @xmath88 primary cerenkov flashes at the far distances . as already mentioned before , in addition the same muons are decaying in flight at a minimal probability @xmath89 leading to a mini - gamma - shower event number in a quite wider area ( @xmath90 ) : @xmath91 therefore , in conclusion , at @xmath52 zenith angle",
    ", there are a flow of primary @xmath92 c.r .",
    "whose earliest showers and consequent secondary muon - arcs as well as nearby muon - electron mini - shower take place at comparable ( one every @xmath93 s. ) rate .",
    "these @xmath94 clustered signals offer an unique tool for immediate gauging and calibrating of magic ( as well as hess , cangaroo , veritas cerenkov telescope arrays ) for horizontal high energy cosmic ray showers .",
    "some more rare event may contain at once both rings , arcs and tail of gamma shower and cerenkov of far primary shower .",
    "it is possible to estimate also the observable muons - electron - cerenkov photons from up - going albedo muons observed by recent ground experiments @xcite @xcite : their flux is already suppressed at zenith angle @xmath95 by at least two order of magnitude and by four order for up - going zenith angles @xmath96 .",
    "pairs or bundles are nevertheless even more rare ( up to @xmath97 @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "they are never associated to up - going shower out of the case of tau or by nearby glashow @xmath98 air - showers and comparable @xmath99 detectable by stereoscopic magic or hess array telescopes , selecting and evaluating their column depth origination , just discussed below .",
    "the appearance of horizontal uhe @xmath100 @xmath101 air - showers ( hortaus or earth - skimming neutrinos ) has been widely studied @xcite,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ; their rise from the earth is source of rare clear signals for neutrino uhe astronomy ( see fig.3 and fig.4 ) .",

    "@xcite hitting and showering in air have non negligible event number : @xmath103 assuming the minimal gzk neutrino flux : @xmath104 ev @xmath105 ; the energy flux is @xmath106 @xmath42 ev @xmath107.(we assume an observing distance at the horizons @xmath46 . ) therefore during a year of night records and such a minimal gzk flux , a crown array of a @xmath108 magic - like telescopes on @xmath109 circle facing the horizons , would discover an event number comparable to a @xmath110 detector , ( nearly a dozen events a year ) . in conclusion while magic looking up see down - ward @xmath2 tens gevs astronomy , magic facing the horizons may well see far uhe ( pevs - eevs ) cr , and rarely , along the edge , gzk @xmath98 neutrinos showering in air , as well as charged current @xmath111,@xmath112 whose decay in flight while in air leads to hortau air - showers .",

    "eev tau and glashow showers in present magic upward horizons might be present during grb or sgr or agn activities .",
    "already magic looking at earth edge is comparable to amanda at pevs energies .",
    "contrary to spherical symmetric showers in water and ice - cube , or blurred radio showers from ice and salt ( anita - like experiments ) , such neutrino induced air - showers are well collimated toward their source , offering a first view of yet undiscovered neutrino astronomy ."
