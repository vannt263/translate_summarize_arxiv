    "although deterministic in principle classically chaotic motion is stochastic in nature .",
    "ever since the early numerical study of chirikov mapping @xcite revealed that the motion of a phase space variable can be characterized by a simple random walk diffusion equation , attempts have been made to describe the chaotic motion in terms of langevin or fokker - planck equations @xcite .",
    "it is therefore easy to comprehend a close connection between classical chaos and statistical mechanics .",
    "two distinct situations arise in this context .",
    "the first one concerns whether classical chaos may serve as a basis for classical statistical mechanics since the ultimate justification of the postulates of statistical mechanics like boltzmann hypothesis of molecular chaos , ergodicity or the postulate of equal a priori probability rests on the dynamics of each particle @xcite .",
    "the second one concerns the following : given that the classical chaotic motion is stochastic how and to what extent one can realize the formulation of statistical mechanics for useful description of classical chaos @xcite keeping in mind that one essentially deals here with a few - degree - of - freedom system .",
    "the present paper addresses the second issue .",
    "the emergence of stochastic behaviour of the classically chaotic system is due to the loss of correlation of initially nearby trajectories .",
    "this is reflected in the nature of the largest lyapunov exponent @xcite whose calculation rests on the linear equation of motion for the separation of these trajectories .",
    "when chaos has fully set in , the time dependence of the linear stability matrix or jacobian of the system @xcite in the equation of motion in the tangent space can be described as a stochastic process since the phase space variables behave as stochastic variables . in a number of recent studies",
    "we have shown @xcite that this fluctuation of the jacobian is amenable to a theoretical description in terms of the theory of multiplicative noise .",
    "this allows us to realize a number of important results of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics , like kubo relation @xcite , fluctuation - decoherence relation @xcite , exponential divergence of quantum fluctuations @xcite , thermodynamically inspired quantities , e. g. , entropy production in chaotic dynamics .",
    "based on a fokker - planck description in the tangent space where the drift and the diffusion coefficients explicitly depend on the phase space variables or dynamical properties of the system , we show that a connection between the two moments in terms of the stochastic parameters which characterize the long time limit of the dynamical system can be established in the spirit of fluctuation - dissipation relation .",
    "we verify the theoretical proposition by numerical experiments on a simple dissipative system .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we introduce a fokker - planck description of the dynamical system in the tangent space and identify the drift and diffusion coefficients which are the functions of fluctuations of the phase space variables .",
    "this is followed by solving the fokker - planck equation for the steady state distribution required for the calculation of long time averages in sec iii . in sec .",
    "iv the dynamical stochastic parameters which characterize the long time behaviour of the system are introduced .",
    "the first one of them is a well - known stochastic parameter closely related to kolmogorov entropy . with the help of these stochastic parameters",
    "we establish a connection between the drift and diffusion coefficients of the fokker - planck equation in the spirit of fluctuation - dissipation relation in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics . in sec .",
    "v we illustrate the general method by an explicit numerical example to verify the theoretical proposition .",
    "the paper is concluded in sec .",
    "we are concerned here with a general n - degree - of - freedom system whose hamiltonian is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 are the co - ordinate and momentum of the i - th degree - of - freedom , respectively , which satisfy the generic form of equations    @xmath2    we now make the hamiltonian system dissipative by introducing @xmath3 on the right hand side of the second of eqs.(2 ) .",
    "for simplicity we assume @xmath4 to be the same for all the n degrees of freedom . by invoking the symplectic structure of the hamiltonian dynamics as @xmath5 and defining i as @xmath6\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where e is an @xmath7 unit matrix , and",
    "@xmath8 is an @xmath7 null matrix , the equation of motion for the dissipative system can be written as @xmath9    we now consider two nearby trajectories , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 at the same time @xmath13 in @xmath14 dimensional phase space .",
    "the time evolution of separation of these trajectories is then determined by @xmath15 in the tangent space @xmath16 , where @xmath17 therefore the @xmath18 linear stability matrix @xmath19 assumes the following form @xmath20 \\label{e6}\\ ] ] where is an @xmath7 matrix .",
    "note that the time dependence of stability matrix @xmath21 is due to the second derivative @xmath22 which is determined @xcite by the equation of motion ( 3 ) .",
    "the procedure for calculation of @xmath23 and the related quantities is to solve the trajectory equation ( 3 ) simultaneously with eq.(4 ) .",
    "thus when the dissipative system described by ( 3 ) is chaotic , ( t ) becomes ( deterministically ) stochastic due to the fact that @xmath24-s behave as stochastic variables and the equation of motion ( [ e4 ] ) in the tangent space can be interpreted as a stochastic equation @xcite .    in the next step",
    "we shall be concerned with a stochastic description of @xmath21 or @xmath25 .",
    "for convenience we split up into two parts as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is independent of variables @xmath28 and therefore behaves a sure or constant part and @xmath29 is determined by the variables @xmath28 for @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath29 refers to the fluctuating part .",
    "we now rewrite the equation of motion ( [ e4 ] ) in tangent space as @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the vectors with @xmath14 components .",
    "corresponding to ( [ e7 ] ) @xmath33 in ( [ e8 ] ) can be split up again to yield    @xmath34    eq.([e4 ] ) indicates that eq.([e8 ] ) is linear in @xmath16 .",
    "eqs.([e4 ] ) , ( [ e5 ] ) and ( [ e6 ] ) express the fact the first @xmath35 components of @xmath36 are zero and the last @xmath35 components of @xmath36 are the functions of @xmath16 for @xmath37 .",
    "the fluctuation in @xmath38 is caused by the chaotic variables @xmath39-s .",
    "this allows us to write the following relation ( which will be used later on ) , @xmath40 where @xmath41 ) is any function of @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath42 refers to differentiation with respect to components @xmath16 ( explicitly @xmath43 for @xmath37 and @xmath44 for @xmath45 ) .",
    "note that eq.([e9 ] ) by virtue of ( [ e8 ] ) is a linear stochastic differential equation with multiplicative noise where the noise is due to @xmath28 determined by equation of motion ( [ e3 ] ) .",
    "this is the starting point of our further analysis .",
    "eq.([e9 ] ) determines a stochastic process with some given initial conditions @xmath46 .",
    "we now consider the motion of a representative point @xmath32 in @xmath14 dimensional tangent space ( @xmath47 ) as governed by eq.([e9 ] ) .",
    "the equation of continuity which expresses the conservation of points determines the variation of density function @xmath48 in time as given by @xmath49    expressing @xmath50 and @xmath51 as @xmath52 we may rewrite the equation of continuity as @xmath53   \\phi(x , t ) \\ ; \\;. \\label{e13}\\ ] ]    it is easy to recognize that while @xmath50 denotes the sure part @xmath51 contains the multiplicative fluctuations through @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath55 is a parameter introduced from outside to keep track of the order of fluctuations in the calculations .",
    "at the end we put @xmath56 .",
    "one of the main results for the linear equations of the form with multiplicative noise may now be in order @xcite .",
    "the average equation of @xmath57 obeys [ @xmath58 , @xmath59    the above result is based on second order cumulant expansion and is valid when fluctuations are small but rapid and the correlation time @xmath60 is short but finite or more precisely    @xmath61    we have , in general , @xmath62 . here @xmath63 implies @xmath64 .",
    "the eq.([e14 ] ) is exact in the limit @xmath65 .",
    "making use of relation ( [ e12 ] ) in ( [ e14 ] ) we obtain @xmath66 the above equation can be transformed into the following fokker - planck equation ( @xmath67 ) for probability density function @xmath68 , ( the details are given in the appendix a ) ; @xmath69 where , @xmath70 and @xmath71 is a @xmath14-dimensional vector whose components are defined by @xmath72 here the determinants @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are given by @xmath76    it is easy to recognize @xmath77 as an evolution operator . because of the dissipative perturbation we note that div @xmath78 .",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath79 in eq.([e17 ] ) is defined as @xmath80 we have followed closely van kampen s approach @xcite to generalized fokker - planck equation ( [ e17 ] ) . before concluding this section several critical remarks regarding this derivation need attention :    first",
    ", the stochastic process @xmath81 determined by @xmath28 is obtained _ exactly _ by solving equations of motion ( [ e3 ] ) for the chaotic motion of the system .",
    "it is therefore necessary to emphasize that we have _ not assumed _ any special property of noise , such as , @xmath81 is gaussian or @xmath82-correlated .",
    "we reiterate van kampen s emphasis in this approach .",
    "second , the only assumption made about the noise is that its correlation time @xmath60 is short but finite compared to the coarse - grained timescale over which the average quantities evolve .",
    "third , we take care of fluctuations upto second order which implies that the deterministic noise is not too strong .",
    "eq.([e17 ] ) is the required fokker - planck equation in the tangent space @xmath16 .",
    "note that the drift and diffusion coefficients are determined by the phase space @xmath28 properties of the chaotic system and directly depend on the correlation functions of the fluctuations of the second derivatives of the hamiltonian ( [ e5 ] ) .",
    "in what follows we shall be concerned with the long time limit of the dynamical system .",
    "thus the steady state distribution of the tangent space co - ordinates @xmath83 are specially relevant for the present purpose . to make all these co - ordinates dimensionless we use the following transformations in eq.(17 )",
    "@xmath84    @xmath85    where @xmath86 is a scaling constant having dimension of reciprocal of time ( a possible choice is the linearized frequency of the dynamical system ) and @xmath87 becomes a dimensionless variable .",
    "@xmath88 is a constant ( to be specified later ) having the dimension of length .",
    "the resulting fokker - planck eq.(17 ) reduces to @xmath89    note that eq.(23 ) is independent of @xmath88 since @xmath90 is linear in @xmath16 and @xmath91(@xmath32 ) is quadratic in @xmath16 .",
    "next we consider the stationary state of the system ( @xmath92 ) and make use of the following linear transformation ( with @xmath93 ) @xmath94    in eq.(23 ) to obtain the equation for steady state probability distribution @xmath95 :    @xmath96    @xmath97-s ( @xmath98 ) are the constants to be determined . here",
    "@xmath99    and @xmath100 and we disregard the time dependence of @xmath101 under weak noise approximation , to treat @xmath101 as a constant in the usual way .    putting ( 24 ) in ( 26 ) and comparing the coefficients of @xmath102 on both sides we obtain @xmath14 algebraic equation ( for @xmath103 and @xmath104 ) .",
    "the set @xmath105 and @xmath104 are therefore known .    the exact steady state solution",
    ", @xmath106 has the well known gaussian form which is given by    @xmath107    where @xmath35 is the normalization constant .",
    "eq.(28 ) expresses the probability distribution of tangent space co - ordinates of the dynamical system in the long time limit . the important relevant quantity which measures the separation of initially nearby trajectories when",
    "the system has attained the stationary state can be computed by calculating the average of @xmath108 . making use of the distribution ( 28 ) we obtain @xmath109",
    "note that the average as calculated above is a function of @xmath110 , @xmath104 and @xmath97-s which are dependent on the phase space properties of the dynamical system .",
    "eq.(25 ) is a steady state fokker - planck equation in tangent space with linear drift and constant diffusion coefficients where the co - ordinates have been expressed as dimensionless variables @xmath112 . @xmath104 and @xmath111 are the first and second moments , respectively , of the underlying stochastic process .",
    "our objective here is seek for a connection between the two moments .",
    "in standard nonequilibrium statistical mechanics this connection is expressed by the fluctuation - dissipation relation through temperature , an equilibrium parameter characterizing the equilibrium state .",
    "our approach here is to follow a somewhat similar procedure .",
    "this implies that we search for the stochastic parameters which characterize the long time limit of the nonlinear dynamical system .",
    "we show that an appropriate relation between @xmath111 and @xmath104 can be established through these parameters .",
    "an important parameter proposed many years ago by casartelli et .",
    "al.@xcite ( a precursor for the largest lyapunov exponent used as a measure of regularity or chaoticity of a nonlinear dynamical system ) is the long time average of @xmath113 where @xmath88 is the separation of the two initially nearby trajectories and @xmath114 is the corresponding separation at some time @xmath13 . to express @xmath114 ( having dimension of length ) we write @xmath115^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ ] .",
    "@xmath114 is determined by solving numerically eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) simultaneously or their appropriately transformed version for the initial condition @xmath116 corresponding to eq.(3 ) . in going from j - th to j+1-th step of iteration in course of time evolution any of the components of @xmath32 say @xmath23 has to be initialized as @xmath117 .",
    "this initialization implies that at each step iteration starts with same magnitude of @xmath88 but the direction of @xmath88 for step j+1 is that of @xmath114 for j - th step ( considered in terms of the ratio @xmath118 ) . for a pictorial illustration",
    "we refer to fig.1 of ref .",
    "j - th time of iteration implies @xmath119 ( @xmath120 and @xmath121 is the characteristic time which corresponds to the shortest ensemble averaged period of nonlinear dynamical system . thus following casartelli et .",
    "@xcite a stochastic parameter can be defined by the following time average of @xmath122 as    @xmath123    it has been shown @xcite that as @xmath124 @xmath125 has a definite value . for the disordered system it is positive and for the regular system it is zero .",
    "the difference of @xmath125 from the largest lyapunov exponent is also noteworthy .",
    "our object here is to generalize ( 30 ) by defining the other higher order moments ( higher than the first @xmath126 ) . to express these quantities",
    "we define first    @xmath127    we now make use of the transformation ( 22 ) to express @xmath114 as a dimensionless quantity in terms of @xmath128 as follows :    @xmath129    the method of cumulant expansion on the other hand tells us that the average of the sum of @xmath130 can be written as    @xmath131    where @xmath132-s result from cumulants of the stochastic quantity @xmath133 .",

    "@xcite we enquire , whether these moments / cumulants reach their steady state values in the long time limit .",
    "we have numerically examined the dependence of @xmath137-s on various parameters .",
    "the parameters are @xmath138 , the time , @xmath88 , the measure of initial separation , the characteristic time @xmath121 ( j - th time of iteration implies @xmath139 ) .",
    "our observation is that the limit @xmath137 or limit @xmath132 as @xmath124 seems to exist in all cases .",
    "we have examined @xcite these limits for a number of test cases , e. g. , for lorentz system , henon - heiles system and others . in fig.(1 ) we exhibit a typical representative long time behaviour of the cumulants @xmath140 for a driven double well potential system discussed in the next section .",
    "it is apparent that they attain their long time limits as @xmath141 .",
    "secondly , the first two cumulants are much higher compared to others the first moment is the stochastic parameter defined by casartelli et .",
    "@xcite as a quantity closely related to kolmogorov entropy .",
    "we are therefore led to believe that the quantities @xmath132-s characterize the long time limit or the steady state of a dynamical system .    the relations ( 33 ) and ( 29 )",
    "can now be combined to give @xmath142    the above relation is the central result of this paper .",
    "this establishes a connection between the drift and the diffusion coefficients of the fokker - planck equation ( 25 ) through the stochastic parameters characterizing long time behaviour of the nonlinear dynamical system .",
    "it must be emphasized that both the drift @xmath104 and the diffusion @xmath111 coefficients arise from the deterministic stochasticity implied in the dynamical equation of motion ( 3 ) .",
    "the relation ( 35 ) is therefore reminiscent of the familiar fluctuation - dissipation relation .",
    "a few points regarding the relation ( 35 ) are in order .",
    "it is important to note that the fluctuation - dissipation relation in conventional nonequilibrium statistical mechanics is valid for a stochastic system for which the noise is internal .",
    "the spiritual root of this relation lies at the dynamic balance between the input of energy into the system from the fluctuations of the surrounding and the output of energy from the system due to its dissipation into the surrounding .",
    "the system - reservoir model @xcite developed over the last few decades suggests that the coupling between the system and the reservoir is responsible for a common origin of drift and diffusion . in the present theory",
    "this common mechanism is the fluctuations of the phase space variables ( or second derivative of the hamiltonian ) inherent in both the drift @xmath104 and the diffusion @xmath110 coefficients of the fokker - planck equation .",
    "we point out that the relation is still valid for the pure hamiltonian system ( @xmath143 ) . for this reason the relation ( 35 ) is somewhat formal in contrast to the standard fluctuation - dissipation relation .",
    "to illustrate the theory developed above , we now choose a driven double - well oscillator system with hamiltonian @xmath144 where @xmath145 and @xmath146 are the momentum and position variables of the system . @xmath147 and @xmath148 are the constants characterizing the potential .",
    "@xmath149 includes the effect of coupling constant and the driving strength of the external field with frequency @xmath150 .",
    "this model has been extensively used in recent years for the study of chaotic dynamics @xcite .",
    "the dissipative equations of motion for the tangent space variables @xmath151 and @xmath152 corresponding to @xmath146 and @xmath145 ( eq.8 ) read as follows : @xmath153 = \\underline{j } \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{array }",

    "\\delta p_1 = x_2 \\end{array } \\right \\ } \\ ; \\ ; . \\label{e40}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 as expressed in our earlier notation @xmath154 and @xmath155 is given by @xmath156 where @xmath157 .",
    "eq.([e40 ] ) is thus rewritten as @xmath158 with @xmath159 where @xmath160 and @xmath36 are the constant and the fluctuating parts(vectors ) , respectively .",
    "the fluctuation in @xmath36 , i.e. , in @xmath161 is due to stochasticity of the following chaotic dissipative dynamical equations of motion ; @xmath162 the result of eq.([a5 ] ) can then be applied and after some algebra the fokker - planck equation ( 17 ) for the dissipative driven double - well oscillator assumes the following form : @xmath163 where    @xmath164    and @xmath165    with @xmath166    the similarity of the equation ( 40 ) to generalized kramers equation can not be overlooked .",
    "this suggests a clear interplay of chaotic diffusive motion and dissipation in the dynamics .    using the transformation ( 22 ) eq.(40 )",
    "can be written as @xmath167    where @xmath168    @xmath169    and the time dependence of @xmath170 and @xmath171 in the diffusion coefficients have been frozen under weak noise approximation .    now using the linear transformation ( 24 ) in eq.(43 )",
    "we obtain in the stationary state @xmath172    where @xmath173    and @xmath174    where for simplicity it has been assumed that @xmath175 is much small compared to the markovian contribution @xmath176 .    comparing the coefficients of @xmath170 and @xmath171 on both sides of eq.(46 )",
    "we obtain @xmath177    therefore we have @xmath178    here the negative value of @xmath179 is taken to make @xmath104 positive for a physically allowed solution of the steady state distribution ( 49 ) . the solution of eq.(45 )",
    "is given by @xmath180    with the help of above distribution the average quantities in tangent space can be calculated .",
    "thus we have @xmath181    the fluctuation dissipation relation ( 35 ) can then be obtained by combining ( 50 ) with ( 33 ) as follows ; @xmath182    @xmath104 and @xmath179 are to be calculated using ( 48 ) . for these",
    "we require explicit numerical evaluation of @xmath183 as defined in ( 43 ) and ( 44 ) .",
    "the dissipative chaotic motion is governed by equations ( 37 ) and ( 39 ) .",
    "we choose the following values of the parameters @xcite @xmath184 , @xmath185 , @xmath186 , @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",
    "the coupling - cum - field strength @xmath149 has been varied from set to set .",
    "we choose the initial conditions @xmath189 and @xmath190 which ensures strong global chaos .",
    "note that @xmath191 as expressed in ( 42 ) and in the diffusion coefficients are the integrals over the correlations of @xmath161 ( @xmath161 is the fluctuating part of the second derivative of the potential @xmath192 and is given by @xmath193 ) . to calculate the correlation function @xmath194 and the average @xmath195 it is necessary to determine long time series in @xmath161 by numerically solving the classical equation of motion ( 39 ) .",
    "the next step is to carry out the averaging over the time series . for further details of the numerical procedure",
    "we refer to the earlier work @xcite . on the other hand the cumulants @xmath196 ( as defined in ( 34 ) and ( 35 ) )",
    "are calculated from eqs.(37 ) and ( 39 ) directly .",
    "the method has already been outlined in sec.(iv ) and in ref .",
    "we then plot the theoretically calculated values of @xmath111 from the evaluation of @xmath104 , @xmath179 and the cumulants for several values of the coupling constant @xmath149 ( eq.36 ) and compare them with the diffusion coefficients obtained from the direct numerical integration of eqs.(39 ) and ( 37 ) with the appropriate transformation ( 22 ) for the corresponding values of @xmath149 . the result",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "it may be noted that the theoretical and numerical results are in good agreement .",
    "the validity of the fluctuation - dissipation relation as proposed in eq.(35 ) is therefore reasonably satisfactory .",
    "the crucial question of instability of classical motion essentially rests on the linear stability matrix or jacobian matrix associated with the equations of motion .",
    "while the linear stability analysis around the fixed points is based on the assumption of constancy of this matrix we take full account of the time dependence of the quantity in the chaotic regime by considering it to be a stochastic process , since the phase variables behave stochastically .",
    "based on a fokker - planck description in the tangent space we trace the origin of chaotic diffusion and drift in the correlation of fluctuations of the linear stability matrix .",
    "the main conclusions of this study are the following :    \\(i ) we show that a class of dynamical stochastic parameters which attain their steady state values in the long time limit of the dynamical system may be used to characterize the dynamical steady state of the system . the first one of them which was proposed by casartelli et .",

    "\\(ii ) we establish a connection between the drift and the diffusion coefficients of the fokker - planck equation and the dynamical stochastic parameters in the spirit of fluctuation - dissipation relation .",
    "the realization of this relation in chaotic dynamics therefore carries the message that although comprising a few degrees of freedom a chaotic system may behave as a statistical mechanical system ( although in a somewhat different sense ) .",
    "the theoretical relations proposed here are generic for n - degree - of - freedom chaotic hamiltonian system with or without dissipation and have been verified by numerical analysis of a driven nonlinear dissipative system .",
