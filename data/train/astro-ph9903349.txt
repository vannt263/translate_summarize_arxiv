    "standard spectrophotometric synthesis consists in summing the spectra of all generations of stars ( simple stellar populations , ssps ) of appropriate age and metallicity , as provided by the star formation history of the galaxy .",
    "this simple procedure neglects the complexities ( e.g.  dependence on geometry ) introduced by a dust rich ism , whose presence is probably the rule for star forming systems .    to properly reproduce the spectral properties of galaxies from uv to sub  mm we have included in our modelling the effects of dust in three environments : ( 1 ) envelopes of agb stars , ( 2 ) dense star forming molecular complexes ( mcs = hii regions+giant molecular clouds ) , and ( 3 ) diffuse ism ( cirrus ) .",
    "agb dusty shells are directly included in the spectra of ssps according to the prescriptions given by bressan , granato & silva 1998 . as for ( 2 ) and",
    "( 3 ) , see the scheme sketched in figure 1 .",
    "the ism of the axially simmetric galaxy is divided in a dense phase associated with younger stellar generations ( mcs ) and a diffuse phase .",
    "the association between dense dust and young stars stems from the fact that we decrease with the age of each ssp the fraction of its light radiated inside the cloud ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the radiative transfer is solved whenever necessary .",
    "the resulting code ( grasil ) may be used as the observational interface of any code providing the history of sf and eventually of metallicity of the galaxy ( see for instance silva et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the observed uv to radio seds of different types of galaxies , from quiescent ellipticals to massively star  froming ulirgs ,",
    "are remarkably well reproduced with our mdel ( see figure 3 for an example and silva et al .",
    "1998 for details ) .",
    "in the past few years many efforts have been devoted in deriving the cosmic history of star formation and/or metal production , which may constrain models of structure formation .",
    "these derivations are mainly based on optically selected high  z galaxies , in particular by means of the lyman drop  out technique .",
    "a well recognized problem is that optical surveys are strongly biased against very old or very dusty galaxies .",
    "we have thus pursued a complementary approach : a study of the stellar populations of k band selected samples ( one of early type and another of late type galaxies ) in the hdf , as rapresentative of corresponding field populations .",
    "the k  band selection has two advantages : ( 1 ) it minimizes the effects of k- and evolutionary corrections and ( 2 ) the flux at these wavelenghts is contributed mainly by stars dominating the barionic mass .",
    "the early type sample consists in 35 objects with k @xmath2 20.15 , z @xmath3 1.3 , and with the bulk of the light distribution well described by @xmath4 profiles .",
    "the objects appear to be essentially free from dust obscuration . as a consequence the 7 bands photometry ( 4 hst + 3 near ",
    "ir ) from 0.3 to 2.2 micron allows to date the dominant stellar populations , which are found at z @xmath31.3 to have a quite wide range of ages ( typically from 1.5 to 3 gyr ) .",
    "also the bright end of the e / s0 population appears to be mostly in place by that cosmic epoch ( see franceschini et al .",
    "1998 for details ) .",
    "having derived from the sed fitting procedure a good guess of the sf history for each sample galaxy , we have extimated the contribution of the population to the cosmic history of sf .",
    "this is compared with that derived from optical surveys in figure 6 .",
    "it is clear that a significant fraction of light emitted during the star  formation phases of early  type galaxies has been lost in the optical , probably because obscured by dust .",
    "this possibility could explain also the sharp cutoff at z @xmath5 1.3 in the z distribution of our sample galaxies ( figure 4 ) .",
    "a complementary effort we are carrying on , is devoted to a sample of 52 late type ( spiral and irregular ) galaxies with @xmath6 . in this case",
    "the interpretation is more complex because the light emitted by these objects is clearly dust extincted to some degree . as an example we show in figure 5 the best fit we obtain , for a typical object in the sample , together with its @xmath7 contours .",
    "the latter are intended to give a feeling of the level of degeneracy between age and gas content : even assuming a specific model galaxy with a fixed star formation history typical for spirals , it is possible to obtain acceptable fits in a range of ages from 0.5 to 3 gyr at least , simply adjusting the gas content and thus the amount of extinction . only a good coverage of the ir region ( in particular above @xmath8 m ) , where dust radiates the absorbed energy , would allow to discriminate between the many viable possibilities on the basis of optical and near  ir data alone .",
    "therefore our preliminary determination of the contribution of these objects to the sf history of the universe , also shown in figure 6 , is prone to larger model uncertainties , presently under study .",
