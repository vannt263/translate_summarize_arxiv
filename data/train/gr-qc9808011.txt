    "<S> we discuss the phase diagram of the balls in boxes model , with a varying number of boxes . </S>",
    "<S> the model can be regarded as a mean - field model of simplicial gravity . </S>",
    "<S> we analyse in detail the case of weights of the form @xmath0 , which correspond to the measure term introduced in the simplicial quantum gravity simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the system has two phases  : _ elongated _ ( _ fluid _ ) and _ </S>",
    "<S> crumpled_. for @xmath1 the transition between these two phases is first order , while for @xmath2 $ ] it is continuous . </S>",
    "<S> the transition becomes softer when @xmath3 approaches unity and eventually disappears at @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we then generalise the discussion to an arbitrary set of weights . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that if one introduces an additional kinematic bound on the average density of balls per box then a new _ </S>",
    "<S> condensed _ phase appears in the phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> it bears some similarity to the _ crinkled _ phase of simplicial gravity discussed recently in models of gravity interacting with matter fields .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ section ] ]    the mean field description of simplicial gravity introduced in @xcite was analysed in the series of papers @xcite . as discussed there </S>",
    "<S> , the mean field approximation explains many facts observed in numerical experiments of simplicial gravity , such as the appearance of singular vertices and the mother universe , and the discontinuity of the phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> recent work @xcite shows that adding vector matter fields to simplicial gravity effectively amounts to renormalising the @xmath5 parameter in the measure term @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the vertex order . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting phase diagram resembles the phase diagram of the mean  field model which we discuss in detail in this letter .    </S>",
    "<S> the model is given by the partition function  @xcite  : @xmath8 it describes an ensemble of @xmath9 balls distributed in a varying number of boxes , @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the system has at least one box and at most @xmath11 boxes . </S>",
    "<S> the partitions of balls are weighted by the product of one - box weights @xmath12 , where @xmath7 is the number of balls in the box . here </S>",
    "<S> we consider one parameter family of weights  : @xmath13 note that for these weights the minimal number of balls in a box is @xmath14 . if there are no further constraints this implies that the maximal number of boxes is equal to the number of balls @xmath15 .    for large @xmath9 the partition functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 are expected to behave as  : @xmath18 and @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are appropriate thermodynamic potential densities depending on the intensive quantities characteristic for the @xmath22 and @xmath23 ensembles . </S>",
    "<S> the power law corrections for the partition functions with the exponents @xmath24 , @xmath25 disappear in the thermodynamic limit . in our case </S>",
    "<S> they are the leading corrections . in general , however , there might be stronger corrections , for example of the type @xmath26 , with @xmath27 .    substituting the summation in ( [ z ] ) by an integration over a continuous variable </S>",
    "<S> , we can relate the partition functions by the transform  : @xmath28 the additional factor @xmath9 on the right hand side of ( [ integ ] ) comes from the integration measure @xmath29 . in the thermodynamic limit </S>",
    "<S> , this gives  : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is maximum of the integrand in ( [ integ ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath31 is given by the equation  : @xmath32 if the maximum of the integrand lies inside the interval @xmath33 and is equal @xmath34 or @xmath35 otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> additionally we see that in the case when the maximum lies inside the interval @xmath33 the integration over @xmath36 around the saddle point introduces the additional factor @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the following relation between the exponents @xmath24 and @xmath25  : @xmath38 otherwise , the maximum lies at either end of the interval and the integration over @xmath36 introduces a factor @xmath39 , thus @xmath40 we shall return to the exponents @xmath41 later , concentrating now on the thermodynamic limit .    in the @xmath23 ensemble </S>",
    "<S> one defines the average @xmath42  : @xmath43 as we will see this quantity plays the role of the order parameter . in the thermodynamic limit </S>",
    "<S> the equation ( [ ra ] ) reads  : @xmath44 the second equality in the last formula can be treated as an inverse transform to ( [ trans ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it results from the fact that the integrand of ( [ integ ] ) , which corresponds to the distribution of @xmath36 , is sharply peaked around @xmath31 when @xmath45 and the position of the peak also becomes the average of the distribution .    </S>",
    "<S> the task of determining @xmath31 relies on finding the maximum of the function @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> the function @xmath20 can be found by the saddle point method @xcite  : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a value which maximises the right hand side of the above expression for the given @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the function @xmath49 is defined as  : @xmath50    the properties of the function @xmath49 are central to the further considerations as they fully determine the behaviour of the model . for the particular choice of weights ( [ w ] )  : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a function familiar from bose - einstein condensation , which has an integral representation  : @xmath53 the function @xmath54 is defined on the interval @xmath55 , so @xmath56 is either a solution of the saddle point equation  : @xmath57 for @xmath58 or else @xmath59 </S>",
    "<S> . the critical value of @xmath36 is @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the riemann zeta function which arises when one inserts @xmath59 into @xmath49 in ( [ kg ] ) . for @xmath62 the function @xmath63 </S>",
    "<S> has no maximum in the range @xmath64 and @xmath59 .    </S>",
    "<S> we thus see that the function @xmath20 as a function of @xmath36 changes regime at @xmath65 . for @xmath62 </S>",
    "<S> _ ie _ @xmath59 the equation ( [ ff ] ) reduces to the linear dependence  : @xmath66 where @xmath67 we have added the minus sign in the definition of @xmath68 for convenience to adjust to the sign in the saddle point formula ( [ trans ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the function @xmath20 as a function of @xmath36 has different qualitative behaviour depending on @xmath3 . for @xmath69 the function has a linear piece for @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> this piece becomes shorter when @xmath3 approaches @xmath71 and finally disappears . for @xmath72 </S>",
    "<S> the function has no linear piece , but it does have a finite derivative at @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> this distinguishes this range from @xmath74 where the derivative @xmath75 at @xmath73 is infinite . </S>",
    "<S> representative shapes of the function @xmath76 for @xmath3 from the three ranges are shown in figure  [ ffr ] . </S>",
    "<S> this figure is supplemented by figure  [ f1 ] where the derivative is plotted to expose its behaviour at @xmath73 . with this picture in mind </S>",
    "<S> one can see the main feature of the solution @xmath31 of the saddle point equation ( [ trans ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> namely , for @xmath74 , for each @xmath77 it has always a solution in the range @xmath33 . for @xmath72 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath31 lies in the range @xmath33 so long as @xmath78 , whereas @xmath34 for @xmath79 . finally , for @xmath69 , the solution lies in the range @xmath80 for @xmath78 and then jumps to @xmath34 for @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated in figure  [ f2 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the discontinuity at @xmath82 ( [ kcr ] ) has the height @xmath83 given by ( [ rcr ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the average @xmath84 is an order parameter for the model . a simple consequence of equation ( [ rcr ] ) </S>",
    "<S> is that the transition becomes continuous when @xmath85 since @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the transition stays continuous as long as @xmath3 is in the range @xmath87 $ ] . in this range the @xmath86 and @xmath68 is finite and given by ( [ kcr ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath3 approaches unity , @xmath88 and the transition disappears . </S>",
    "<S> this process is illustrated in figure  [ f2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath89 the values of the derivative @xmath90 span the interval @xmath91 and the saddle point equation ( [ trans ] ) always has a nonzero solution @xmath31 for the whole range of @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> the model therefore has only one phase and no phase transition . to illustrate this , </S>",
    "<S> consider the solution when @xmath92  : @xmath93 which is a smooth function spanning the range @xmath33 without any singularity .    </S>",
    "<S> the phase diagram in the @xmath23 plane is drawn in figure  [ f3 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the solid line is a discontinuous phase transition with a nonzero gap @xmath83 ( [ rcr ] ) while the dashed line is a continuous transition .    coming back to the range @xmath94 of @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> one can determine the singularity type of the thermodynamical functional @xmath21 at the transition _ ie _ when @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> for small @xmath96  : @xmath97 inserting this into the equation ( [ mur ] ) one obtains for small @xmath96  : @xmath98 or , after inverting it for @xmath96  : @xmath99 in this range of @xmath3 @xmath86 and so @xmath56 is given by the equation  : @xmath100 for small @xmath56 we can write  : @xmath101 inverting this with respect to @xmath36 we eventually get  : @xmath102{where } x = \\frac{2-\\beta}{\\beta-1 } \\quad .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the exponent @xmath103 varies between @xmath104 and @xmath105 as @xmath3 grows from one to two . in the limiting case @xmath106 , the exponent @xmath107 which means that the singularity becomes arbitrarily soft , which perfectly matches the fact that for @xmath74 there is no singularity . at the other end of the interval , </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath108 , the exponent @xmath109 , which means that @xmath42 becomes an arbitrarily steep function at @xmath68 which again agrees with the fact that for @xmath69 the function is discontinuous at @xmath68 .    </S>",
    "<S> what we have discussed so far is an extension and refinement of the analysis of the model presented in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a few comments are in order . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis can be generalised for an arbitrary set of weights . in general , the transition takes place when the argument @xmath110 of the series ( [ kg0 ] ) approaches the radius of convergence of the series . </S>",
    "<S> denote the radius by @xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> in our example the radius was @xmath112 _ ie _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath113 , but in general @xmath114 may be any finite number . </S>",
    "<S> the condition for the existence of the transition is that the generating function @xmath115 ( [ kg0 ] ) is finite at the radius of convergence of the series  : @xmath116 the family of weights may be parametrised by many parameters . in the last formula </S>",
    "<S> , the parameters are represented by a single symbol @xmath3 . the equation  : @xmath117 is the equation of the critical line between the phases of the @xmath23 ensemble . moreover , </S>",
    "<S> as one can see by repeating the arguments previously used for the particular weights ( [ w ] ) , the condition for the transition to be discontinuous is  : @xmath118 since the inverse of the derivative @xmath119 corresponds to the latent heat . </S>",
    "<S> the transition is continuous for @xmath3 s for which the latent heat vanishes and condition ( [ kk ] ) is fulfilled .    </S>",
    "<S> the position of the critical line on the phase diagram can be easily changed by a slight modification of weights . </S>",
    "<S> for example , a simple multiplication by a constant @xmath120  : @xmath121 corresponds to a horizontal shift of the critical line in the phase diagram  ( fig .  [ f3 ] ) . in general a slight modification of weights can also change the @xmath3 position of critical line and thus the critical exponent ( [ x ] ) . in this respect </S>",
    "<S> this model is `` non - universal '' ( see also @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> so far we have discussed the behaviour of the model in the thermodynamic limit . </S>",
    "<S> we now determine the exponents @xmath24 ( [ zf ] ) and @xmath25 ( [ phi ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is convenient to define the grand canonical partition function  : @xmath122 whose singularity type depends on the exponent @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the critical value of the chemical potential is @xmath123 is zero in the crumpled and nonzero in the fluid phase . </S>",
    "<S> the value of the exponent @xmath25 depends also on the position @xmath23 in the phase diagram . from ( [ z ] ) </S>",
    "<S> one obtains the following expression  : @xmath124 from which one can extract the singularity . in the fluid phase </S>",
    "<S> , the singularity comes from the residual denominator and it is  : @xmath125 from which one concludes that @xmath126 .    </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath23 in the crumpled phase , the singularity comes from the numerator of the fraction ( [ zfraction ] ) which itself has a power like singularity when @xmath96 approaches @xmath127 . </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath128 and hence @xmath129 . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the partition function inherits the singularity from the weights or more precisely from the generating function @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> this effect comes from the dominance of the singular box contribution over the negligible entropy . in general </S>",
    "<S> the singularity need not be power like . for example the weights  : @xmath130 , where @xmath131 and @xmath132 are positive constants , would lead to an essential singularity . in this case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath133 would not be the dominant correction to the partition function .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now determine the singularity type on the critical line . </S>",
    "<S> the singularity comes from the denominator in the expression ( [ zfraction ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it changes at @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath69 the expansion of the denominator in small @xmath96 begins with the linear term . because the numerator approaches a non - vanishing constant for @xmath134 , we have  : @xmath135 and hence @xmath136 as in the fluid phase . for @xmath137 the expansion of the denominator begins with the singular term @xmath138 ( [ gb ] ) , thus @xmath139 and @xmath140 .    </S>",
    "<S> so far we have tacitly set @xmath14 , which meant that each box contained at least one ball . </S>",
    "<S> as a result , the system with @xmath9 balls could have @xmath10 boxes at most . </S>",
    "<S> hence the maximal value of @xmath36 is @xmath112 . </S>",
    "<S> if one instead chooses @xmath141 to be larger than one then the maximal @xmath36 is  : @xmath142 in this case , the analysis of the model proceeds exactly as before , except that in place of @xmath112 for the upper limit one sets @xmath143 . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , the range of integration in equation ( [ integ ] ) is now @xmath144 and the derivative @xmath75 is infinite at @xmath145 . </S>",
    "<S> the average @xmath42 approaches asymptotically @xmath145 when @xmath146 . </S>",
    "<S> so the only essential difference to the previous analysis is the range of @xmath36 . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , the phase structure of the model is unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> we shall call @xmath145 the _ natural limit _ for @xmath36 .    </S>",
    "<S> the phase structure of the model can be made more complex by introducing a slight modification . </S>",
    "<S> let us impose a kinematic upper limit on @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> we shall call this the _ artificial limit _ and denote it by @xmath147 . </S>",
    "<S> the artificial limit obviously has to lie below the natural one , @xmath148 . </S>",
    "<S> now the partition function becomes  : @xmath149 the main difference between the natural and the artificial limit is that the derivative @xmath75 is infinite at the former and finite at the latter . in the case of a model with the natural limit </S>",
    "<S> , this limit is never reached by the average @xmath42 , or at worst reached only asymptotically for @xmath146 , whereas the artificial limit can be reached for finite @xmath77 when the term @xmath150 dominates over @xmath20 in the integrand ( [ integres ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> if we fix @xmath3 and change @xmath77 from large positive values towards large negative , the system is first in the condensed phase @xmath151 , then at the critical value @xmath42 jumps to @xmath83 and later smoothly rises until it reaches @xmath147 where it sticks ( see figure  [ f4 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> such a situation is very similar to the previous standard one .    </S>",
    "<S> there exists , however , the possibility of quite different behaviour . for @xmath152 where @xmath153 is defined by the equation  : @xmath154 the value of @xmath83 is larger than @xmath147 . in this case , at the transition from the condensed phase @xmath42 jumps from zero directly to @xmath147 . </S>",
    "<S> it can not jump to @xmath83 because this lies above @xmath147 and is beyond the allowed kinematic range ( figure  [ f4 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> this gives a new phase which is neither crumpled nor fluid . </S>",
    "<S> it has @xmath155 but on the other hand there is a singular box in the system . </S>",
    "<S> we call this phase _ condensed _ , as it is analogous to the condensed phase of the canonical @xmath156 ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> we have marked the critical line separating the condensed phase from fluid one by the dotted line on the phase diagram in the figure  [ f3 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> define the quantity  : @xmath157 which is the fraction of all balls which are in the singular box . </S>",
    "<S> the quantities @xmath42 and @xmath158 play the role of the order parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we have  : @xmath159    the phase diagram is very similar to the one of simplicial gravity with the matter fields or the measure term @xcite . if one naively applies the mean field model to 4d simplicial gravity one would get the following constraint for the orders of vertices  : @xmath160 where @xmath161 is the total number of vertices , @xmath162 the order of vertex @xmath163 , and @xmath164 is the number of 4simplices . </S>",
    "<S> we thus have the correspondence @xmath165 , @xmath166 and @xmath167 . </S>",
    "<S> the minimal order of a vertex is @xmath168 , so the natural limit @xmath169 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that  : @xmath170 is the natural upper limit for @xmath171 from the point of view of the mean field model . </S>",
    "<S> as we know this limit is never reached since the simplicial structure imposes the limit @xmath172 which in the language of the mean field model corresponds to the artificial upper limit@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the full 4d theory thus provides the structure which we have assumed in the discussion of the mean  field model . of course , the cut off at @xmath173 is not as sharp as we have assumed . </S>",
    "<S> one expects a smooth cut off , which means that the entropy of configurations for @xmath174 approaching @xmath173 gradually decreases in comparison with the mean field model , so that the upper limit @xmath175 is not reached at finite @xmath176 but rather asymptotically approached for large @xmath176 .    </S>",
    "<S> the source of the limit @xmath177 in simplicial gravity is purely geometrical and results from the fact that @xmath162 is the number of 4-simplices . </S>",
    "<S> a consequence of this is that if we add a point with @xmath178 , for example by a barycentric subdivision , we increase the numbers @xmath179 of neighbouring vertices@xcite . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath162 s are not independent and in particular one can not make all of them equal to @xmath180 as the natural limit would require .    </S>",
    "<S> the exponent @xmath25 requires some comment . in the theory of random geometries </S>",
    "<S> one defines the string susceptibility exponent @xmath181 , which is the counterpart of @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the exponents @xmath25 is shifted by a constant with respect to the standard definition of @xmath181  : @xmath182 . </S>",
    "<S> if one followed these definitions in the fluid phase one would obtain @xmath183 in the @xmath23 ensemble since , as we have seen , @xmath136 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the mean field model neglects all the subtle effects and combinatorial factors coming from topological constraints imposed by the local geometry so one should treat this value with some caution </S>",
    "<S> .    similarly , the crumpled phase of the ball in boxes model has @xmath184 , but the following argument suggests that the corresponding value of @xmath181 is _ not _ that which is naively expected . </S>",
    "<S> the balls in boxes model in the particular case of the @xmath185 ensemble can be mapped onto the branched polymer model with the topology of sphere @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one can recognise the fluid phase of the balls in boxes model as the generic phase of the branched polymer model . for the former @xmath186 , whereas for the latter @xmath187 , from which one can conjecture @xmath188 rather than @xmath25 as we are dealing with a fixed number of boxes ensemble in the branched polymer analogy . ] . </S>",
    "<S> switching back to the varying number of boxes ensemble we have @xmath189 in the crumpled phase from equation ( [ yy2 ] ) , and @xmath190 .    to calculate @xmath181 and hence @xmath41 in the condensed phase </S>",
    "<S> we will use a heuristic argument . </S>",
    "<S> we know that @xmath189 since the phase is again on the kinematic border ( [ yy2 ] ) , as for the crumpled phase , but @xmath24 is now the exponent of the fixed @xmath191 ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> as before , in the particular case @xmath185 we can take the value of @xmath192 from the branched polymer model ( @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> if we assume that this relation holds independently of @xmath36 , and that @xmath188 as conjectured above for the crumpled phase , we obtain @xmath193 which differs by one from the crumpled phase value .    </S>",
    "<S> we think that the main feature of the mean  field solution is that the exponent @xmath181 properly reflects an universal behaviour , _ ie _ it is independent on the location in the phase diagram as long as the system is in the fluid phase . </S>",
    "<S> this is more important in the context of simplicial gravity than the particular predictions for the exponent @xmath181 calculated for our choice of power law weights . </S>",
    "<S> mean field theories will , in any case , generically predict critical exponents incorrectly .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have seen that the mean field model of simplicial quantum gravity can account for many of the features seen in simulations of the full model . with the correct choice of ensemble ( a varying number of boxes ) </S>",
    "<S> we reproduce the first order nature of the transition for for @xmath1 , while for @xmath2 $ ] it is continuous , disappearing altogether at @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we have also remarked that taking further account of the _ local _ geometrical constraints in the model can be implemented as a lowered limit on the region of integration in the saddle point equation , which we have denoted as the artificial upper limit . with the artificial limit in place </S>",
    "<S> we found the modified phase diagram of figure  [ f3 ] , which possesses a new condensed phase . </S>",
    "<S> this is similar to the crinkled phase of full simplicial gravity with matter fields or the ( apparently equivalent ) measure term @xcite . </S>"
