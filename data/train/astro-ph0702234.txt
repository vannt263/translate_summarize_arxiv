    "quark stars have long ago been proposed as an alternative to neutron stars @xcite .",
    "the `` strange matter hypothesis '' @xcite gave a more precise theoretical formulation for their existence : that at zero pressure three flavor quark matter , i.e. with @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 quarks , has a lower density per baryon than nuclear matter and would hence be the true ground state of baryonic matter .",
    "these stars are now called `` strange stars '' @xcite and share many similarities with neutron stars : they can have similar masses , have similar radii in the observed range of masses , similar cooling histories and , to date , it has been practically impossible to conclusively prove or disprove their existence ( for recent reviews , see @xcite ) .",
    "one possible distinctive property of a strange star could be a small radius . given the impossibility to treat quark - quark interactions from first principles , i.e. starting from q.c.d .",
    ", at densities relevant for compact stars , only simplified models are possible and results are , naturally , model dependent .",
    "however , several classes of such models do predict small radii , @xmath3 km at masses @xmath4 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and _",
    "all _ models predict very small radii , @xmath5 km , at masses @xmath6 .",
    "hence , measurement of a compact star radius giving a radius @xmath7 km directly allows a claim for a strange star candidate .",
    "the `` magnificent seven '' @xcite arouse great expectations to measure compact star radii with high enough accuracy to put strong constraints on the dense matter equation of state .",
    "in particular , fits of the observed soft x - ray thermal spectrum of rx j1856.5 - 3754 @xcite pointed to a very small radius and lead to the claim that this object may be a strange star @xcite .",
    "however , observations in the optical band allowed the identification of the rayleigh - jeans tail of a second component of the surface thermal emission , corresponding to a lower temperature and much larger radius than the component detected in the x - ray band .",
    "an interpretation of these results is that the surface temperature of the star is highly non - uniform @xcite , possibly due to the presence of a strong magnetic field .",
    "models of surface temperature distribution with purely poloidal magnetic fields @xcite do predict non - uniform surface temperature distributions , , but such inhomogeneities are not strong enough to produce such small x - ray emitting regions surrounded by large cold regions detectable in the optical band as observed .",
    "however , inclusion of a toroidal component of the magnetic field , confined to the neutron star crust , has a dramatic effect ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) : this field component inhibits heat from the stellar core to flow to the surface through most of the crust , except for small domains surrounding the magnetic axis , and results in highly non - uniform surface temperature distributions producing good fits to the observed thermal spectra , from the optical up to the x - ray band .",
    "these models of small hot regions , detected in the x - ray band , surrounded by large cold regions , detected in the optical band , which allow to reproduce the entire observed thermal spectrum and results in large radii for the star are in contradiction with the proposed strange star interpretation of rx j1856.5 - 3754 , which was based on the small radius detected in the x - ray band .",
    "here we want to push the discussion one step further : are these highly non - uniform surface temperature distributions , assuming they are real , incompatible with a strange star model ?",
    "we consider strange stars having a thin crust , composed of normal bayonic matter , with a strong magnetic field . since a strange star crust",
    "can , at most , reach the neutron drip density , it is much thiner than the crust of a normal neutron star and the specific question is : can such a thin layer produce the surface temperature distributions deduced from observation ?",
    "scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we will consider strange star models built on the mit - bag inspired equation of state of @xcite which has three parameters : the qcd coupling constant @xmath8 , the bag constant @xmath9 and the strange quark mass @xmath10 ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 quarks are treated as massless ) . figure  [ fig:1 ] illustrates four families of such strange matter models : by varying the parameters , these equations of state allow the production of a wide range of models , from very compact stars up to very large ones .",
    "it is important to notice from this figure that , depending on the assumed parameters of the model , strange stars can have large radii and thus , although a small radius measurement is a strong argument in favor of a strange star , a large radius is _ not _ an argument against a stange star .",
    "on top of the quark matter , a thin crust can exist as long as the electron density within it is smaller than that in the quark matter @xcite .",
    "such a baryonic crust is , however , much thinner than a neutron star crust as illustrated in figure  [ fig:2 ] .",
    "following the neutron star models presented by @xcite we consider dipolar magnetic fields with three components ( figure  [ fig:3 ] ) : a poloidal one maintained by currents in the quark core , @xmath11 , a poloidal one maintained by currents in the baryonic crust , @xmath12 , and a toroidal one maintained by currents in the baryonic crust , @xmath13 .",
    "the separation between currents in the crust and in the core is motivated by the likely fact that quark matter forms a maxwell superconductor @xcite : at the moment of the phase transition , occurring very early in the life of the star , superconductivity will prevent any current in the crust from penetrating the core while currents in the core will become supercurrents and be frozen there .",
    "moreover , flux expulsion due to the star s spin - down can also significantly increase the crustal field at the expense of the core field .    , @xmath14 mev and four different strange quark masses as indicated . indicated are also the electron chemical potentials @xmath15 at the quark surface , which is the parameter determining the maximum baryonic crust density , i.e. , the baryonic crust thickness .",
    "the crust equation of state is from @xcite .",
    ", scaledwidth=35.0% ]    the importance of the crustal field is that its field lines are forced to be closed within the crust and hence it has a very large meridional component @xmath16 , compared to the core component . due to the classical larmor rotation of electrons ,",
    "a magnetic field causes anisotropy of the heat flux and the heat conductivity becomes a tensor whose components perpendicular , @xmath17 , and parallel , @xmath18 , to the field lines become @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the conductivity in the absence of a magnetic field , @xmath21 the electrons cyclotron frequency and @xmath22 their collisional relaxation time .",
    "the large values of @xmath16 in the crust have the effect of inhibiting radial heat flow except in regions close to the magnetic axis where @xmath23 dominates over @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "we performed heat transport calculations using the 2d code described in @xcite which incorporates the thermal conductivity anisotropy described by eq .",
    "[ equ : kappa ] .",
    "details of the crust microphysics are as described in @xcite . we consider a strange star model with a radius of @xmath24 11 km and a baryonic crust of thickness @xmath24 250 m for a 1.4 @xmath25 mass .",
    "the two poloidal components of the magnetic field are parametrized by @xmath26 and @xmath27 which are the strengths of the corresponding field components at the surface of the star along the magnetic axis so that , ideally , @xmath28 would be the dipolar field estimated from the star s spin - down .",
    "notice that the maximum value of @xmath29 in the crust is only slightly larger than @xmath26 while * maximum values of * @xmath30 * are up to almost 100 times larger than * @xmath31 due to its large tangential component , @xmath32 , resulting from the compression of the field within the narrow crust .",
    "the strength of the toroidal field is parametrized by @xmath33 , defined as the maximum value reached by @xmath34 within the crust .",
    "we keep @xmath26 at @xmath35 g and vary @xmath27 and @xmath33 .",
    "we display in figure  [ fig:4 ] the resulting crustal temperature profiles for several typical values of @xmath27 and @xmath33 .",
    "one sees that , independently of the strength of the poloidal component , @xmath33 needs to reach @xmath36 g to have a significant effect , a result similar to what was obtained by @xcite for the neutron star case .",
    "however , independently of the value of @xmath33 , once @xmath27 reaches @xmath35 g highly non - uniform temperature profiles develop in the thin strange star crust : such profiles are sufficiently non - uniform to produce the wanted surface temperature distribution , i.e. small hot regions surrounded by extended cold ones .",
    "the optical + x - ray spectrum of rx j1856.5 - 3754 , when fitted with blackbodies , requires two components with very different temperatures and emitting areas .",
    "the implied highly non - uniform surface temperature distribution can be physically justified by the introduction of a very strong magnetic field , whose supporting currents are mostly located whithin the star s crust .",
    "we have shown here that , similarly to the neutron star case , such field configurations can be found in the case of a strange star , despite the shallowness of its baryonic crust . however , the strength of these fields , either the toroidal component @xmath13 or the crust anchored poloidal one @xmath12 must reach strengths close to , or above , @xmath36 g to produce the desired temperature anisotropy . similarly to the neutron star case ,",
    "such surface temperature distributions impose severe , but not unrealistic , restrictions on the orientation of either the observer or the magnetic field symmetry axis with respect to the rotation axis to explain the absence of pulsations @xcite .    that the thin stange star crust can support such huge field strenghs is an open question , but a positive answer seems doubtful as some simple estimates illustrate .",
    "the magnetic shear stress , @xmath37 , reaches @xmath38 dyne @xmath39 in the crust when @xmath27 reaches @xmath35 g , which is comparable or higher to the maximum value sustainable by a crust of thickness @xmath40 m @xcite : violent reajustments of the crust are expected but have yet to be observed in any of the `` magnificent seven '' .",
    "moreover , the ohmic decay time in the low density crust is relatively short , less than @xmath41 yrs @xcite , and the presence of such a strong field in a @xmath42 yrs old star would require an initial crustal field about two orders of magnitude higher when the star was young .",
    "( however , the highly non - linear evolution of coupled strong poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields remains to be studied under such condictions ) .",
    "we have also adopted the very ingenuous assumption that the surface emits as a perfect blackbody .",
    "a condensed matter surface may simulate a blackbody spectrum @xcite but such models still require strong fields to produce a non - uniform temperature distribution @xcite . however , other interpretations are possible , such as a thin atmosphere atop a solid surface @xcite which may be able to reproduce both the optical and x - ray spectra without invoking strongly non - uniform temperatures and can be applied as well to strange stars with a crust as to neutron stars since they only consider the very surface of the star .    in conclusion , the crustal field scenario , which is successfull when applied to neutron star models in order to explain the observed thermal spectrum properties of rx j1856.5 - 3754 ,",
    "can be `` successfully '' applied to a strange star model but requires such a huge magnetic field confined within such a thin crust that its applicability is doubtful .",
    "it is hence difficult to conciliate the observed , from optical to x - ray , properties of rx j1856.5 - 3754 with a strange star interpretation unless these are due exclusively to the emitting properties of its surface ."
