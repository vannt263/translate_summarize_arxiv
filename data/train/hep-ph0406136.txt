    "among the many unresolved problems in cosmology , the origin of the matter - antimatter asymmetry , or baryon asymmetry , is the one we can most easily recognize because we could not exist without it . according to recent data from the wmap experiment @xcite , the asymmetry is @xmath5 since the time , about forty years ago ,",
    "when sakharov showed that three conditions must be satisfied to generate this asymmetry @xcite , many authors have tried to explain this asymmetry with many different models .",
    "but we still do nt have any idea which , if any , is the right one because baryogenesis usually depends on unknown physics beyond the reach of current experiments .",
    "besides producing necessary relics such as the baryon asymmetry , a successful cosmological history must also avoid or dilute unwanted cosmological relics such as gravitinos @xcite and moduli @xcite which can destroy the successful predictions of big - bang nucleosynthesis @xcite or over - close the universe , depending on the scale of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "in gravity mediated supersymmetry breaking scenarios , these particles have masses of order @xmath6 to @xmath7 gev and plank scale suppressed couplings .",
    "this indicates their long life time and possibility of disturbing big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "both particles may be thermally produced in dangerous abundances in the early universe , but such production might be avoided if the reheat temperature after inflation was sufficiently low . more seriously , moduli have another more dangerous source , production of coherent moduli oscillations with amplitude of order of the plank scale when the hubble parameter drops below the vacuum mass of the moduli @xcite . in the case of gravity mediated supersymmetry breaking scenarios , this occurs at an energy scale of the order of the intermediate scale , @xmath8 to @xmath9 gev , i.e. after , or at best at , the end of the usual high energy inflation .",
    "thus , we face a disaster unless there is a proper amount of late time entropy release .",
    "fortunately , thermal inflation @xcite provides a compelling solution to this moduli problem .",
    "it is expected to occur after the usual high energy inflation , at an energy scale between the intermediate scale and the electroweak scale , releasing enough entropy to dilute the unwanted relics .",
    "it is driven by the potential energy of a ` flaton ' field which is held at the origin by thermal effects .",
    "when the temperature drops sufficiently , the flaton rolls away from the origin , ending the thermal inflation .",
    "the flaton then oscillates about its vacuum expectation value of the order of @xmath10 to @xmath11 gev till its decay completes at a temperature of order gev .",
    "there are several categories of baryogenesis models and it is important to consider them in the context of the above discussion of a complete and consistent cosmological history .",
    "one is baryogenesis by out of equilibrium decay of heavy particles . for example , gut baryogenesis @xcite uses particles with mass of the order of the gut scale , @xmath12 gev .",
    "right - handed neutrino leptogenesis @xcite uses decay of heavy right - handed neutrinos of mass @xmath11 to @xmath13 gev , and anomalous @xmath14 violating electroweak processes mediated by sphalerons @xcite to convert the generated lepton asymmetry to baryon asymmetry .",
    "however , in both cases , very high energy scales are required to produce the heavy particles .",
    "this means the generated asymmetry would be diluted to negligible amounts by thermal inflation or any other form of entropy production required to dilute the unwanted relics that are produced at lower energy scales .",
    "another category is electroweak baryogenesis @xcite .",
    "it uses the electroweak phase transition and sphalerons .",
    "the attractive point of this mechanism is that it works at a low energy scale , the electroweak scale , so it is rather independent of unknown high energy physics .",
    "however , it seems that the window in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) for this mechanism is small @xcite .",
    "moreover , assuming thermal inflation , the reheat temperature after flaton decay is too low even for this mechanism .",
    "the last major category , affleck - dine ( ad ) baryogenesis @xcite is distinctive from the previous two categories due to its efficiency . using coherent fields along mssm flat directions , it can generate huge asymmetries which can survive substantial dilution .",
    "indeed , in the case of gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking , it can even produce a large enough asymmetry to survive the full entropy production of the thermal inflation needed to dilute the moduli to acceptable levels @xcite .",
    "however , especially in the case of gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking , the ad condensate can fragment into q - balls @xcite , though it is not clear how serious a problem this is as the absorbed baryon asymmetry may be released through the decay of the q - ball @xcite . in the case of gravity",
    "mediated supersymmetry breaking scenarios , the required entropy production is greater , so that not even ad baryogenesis can survive the full entropy production of the thermal inflation .",
    "thus , if we assume supersymmetry breaking is mediated by gravitational strength interactions and thermal inflation solves the moduli problem , all the baryogenesis models suggested so far do not work .",
    "therefore , a new scenario of baryogenesis is required under these assumptions .",
    "this is our motivation .",
    "the new baryogenesis model must satisfy two requirements .",
    "the first is that , as it can not work either before the thermal inflation or after the flaton decay , it must work around the end of the thermal inflation .",
    "the other is that it must generate a large asymmetry which can survive the dilution by the entropy released in the flaton decay . in this paper , we suggest such a model .",
    "it is similar to an earlier model by one of us @xcite , but is based on a more minimal model and crucially relies on some dynamics neglected in @xcite .",
    "we begin our discussion by explaining the construction of our model in section  [ model ] . in section  [ baryo ] ,",
    "we describe our baryogenesis scenario . in section  [ cns ]",
    ", we discuss the constraints on parameters and the stability of dangerous field directions . in section  [ sim ] , we show the results of numerical simulations of the field dynamics . in section  [ after ] , we discuss some of the issues involved in determining whether our generated asymmetry is preserved . in section  [ dis",
    "] , we conclude and comment about future work .",
    "the mssm superpotential is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the generation index , @xmath17 is the su(2 ) index and @xmath18 is the su(3 ) index .",
    "neutrino oscillations @xcite imply nonzero neutrino masses .",
    "so we include the following majorana neutrino mass term @xmath19    we expect thermal inflation as a solution of the moduli problem .",
    "so we need a flaton sector . for simplicity , we consider only a minimal flaton sector consisting of a single field @xmath20 with self - interaction @xmath21 this naturally stabilizes the flaton field at a vacuum expectation value of the order of @xmath10 to @xmath11 gev .",
    "the flaton must also have some interactions with other fields , for example a coupling of the form @xmath22 , to provide the finite temperature potential which holds it at the origin during the thermal inflation . @xmath23 and @xmath24 may carry mssm charges but , as they become very heavy at the end of thermal inflation , are not mssm fields .",
    "they should form complete su(5 ) representations to preserve gauge coupling unification , but would still be expected to leave an imprint on the renormalization of mssm parameters from the gut scale .",
    "as these fields and couplings do not affect our dynamics beyond holding the flaton at the origin during the thermal inflation , we do not specify them explicitly .    the origin of @xmath1 in eq .",
    "( [ mssm ] ) is unknown .",
    "we assume it is absent initially and generated dynamically by the vacuum expectation value of the flaton field via the interaction @xmath25 as was suggested long ago in ref .",
    "@xcite . in our vacuum",
    ", this coupling gives @xmath26 which has the correct size for @xmath1 under the assumption @xmath27 and flaton mass of electroweak scale .",
    "this coupling also gives a reheat temperature after flaton decay high enough for thermalization and standard freeze out of neutralino dark matter @xcite .",
    "given the structure of our model , we could also expect a term @xmath28 with @xmath29 however , we assume @xmath30 to give correct values for the neutrino masses and an appropriate scale for thermal inflation . as we shall see , this means that @xmath31 throughout our dynamics , so such a term is negligible .",
    "thus , our superpotential is @xmath32    we could use a @xmath33 symmetry with charges @xmath34 plus the usual @xmath35-parity , to enforce the above form for the superpotential .",
    "this @xmath33 symmetry could be a gauge symmetry if it is anomaly free @xcite .",
    "it can be made anomaly free by adding an extra two su(5 ) @xmath36 representations and two su(5 ) @xmath37 representations , with coupling @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "some such coupling would in any case be necessary for the thermal inflation as already mentioned . gauging the @xmath33 symmetry",
    "is one way to avoid the potential domain wall problem @xcite caused by the flaton potential s four minima .",
    "we assume we are free from that problem .      in our vacuum ,",
    "all the mssm supersymmetric flat directions in field space are stable at the origin . however , during thermal inflation",
    "the flaton is at the origin , and so there is no @xmath1-term .",
    "this may cause some supersymmetric flat directions involving @xmath41 or @xmath42 to be unstable during thermal inflation .",
    "these potentially unstable flat directions are @xmath4 and @xmath43 .",
    "thus , we assume that the only fields which get nonzero expectation values are @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath44 and @xmath20 .",
    "we will check the consistency of this ansatz in section  [ cns ] .    for simplicity , we will truncate to a single generation",
    ". this may be essentially correct if all the matrices of leptonic sector are simultaneously diagonalizable , while otherwise will hopefully still capture the essential points .",
    "gauge fixing and imposing the @xmath45-term constraints for these flat directions , we can parameterize them as @xmath46 with the remaining @xmath45-term constraint @xmath47 and corresponding gauge degree of freedom .",
    "integrating out the remaining gauge field and choosing the gauge @xmath48 gives @xmath49 thus , the superpotential reduces to @xmath50 and the @xmath51 and @xmath45-term parts of the potential to @xmath52 @xmath53 where @xmath54 .",
    "the vacuum supersymmetry breaking potential is @xmath55\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is adjusted to give zero cosmological constant , and all the other supersymmetry breaking parameters are of the order of the electroweak scale .    again for simplicity , we neglect any field dependent renormalization of the supersymmetry breaking parameters . note that taking into account the @xmath20 dependent renormalization of the supersymmetry breaking parameters will be important for accurate quantitative comparison of our constraints on the supersymmetry breaking parameters near the end of thermal inflation with those parameters in our vacuum .",
    "thus , the whole potential for these fields is given by @xmath57",
    "we are now in a position to describe how baryogenesis can occur in our model .      at high temperature ,",
    "the thermal masses hold all the fields at the origin .",
    "so , we take our initial condition as thermal inflation with all fields having zero expectation value .",
    "we assume @xmath58 and @xmath2 so that the flaton @xmath20 and the supersymmetric flat direction @xmath3 become unstable as the temperature drops during thermal inflation .",
    "we assume @xmath3 rolls away first .",
    "once a field rolls away , it decouples from the thermal bath , and we neglect any remaining thermal potential .",
    "we will discuss the wider implications of our rather non - trivial assumption that @xmath2 in section  [ cns ] .    while the flaton is still held at the origin ,",
    "the potential for @xmath59 and @xmath60 is @xmath61 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\mbox { } + \\left| \\lambda_\\nu l^2 h_u \\right|^2 + \\left| \\lambda_\\nu l h_u^2 \\right|^2 + \\frac{1}{2 } g^2 \\left ( |h_u|^2 - |l|^2 \\right)^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which has minimum at @xmath62 and latexmath:[\\[\\label{huti }    latexmath:[\\[\\label{lti }     for simplicity , we assume @xmath59 and @xmath60 settle down to this minimum before @xmath20 or @xmath64 start rolling away from the origin .",

    "we assume that this does not destabilize @xmath64 .",
    "a sufficient condition for this is @xmath66 though it is probably not necessary .",
    "thermal inflation ends when @xmath20 rolls away from the origin .",
    "we assumed @xmath67 to give correct values for the neutrino masses and an appropriate scale for thermal inflation .",
    "this condition also ensures that the flaton dynamics is dominant as the flaton gets a larger value than @xmath60 , @xmath64 or @xmath59 .",

    "the angular momentum of @xmath85 generated in this way is our lepton number asymmetry .",
    "note that the cross term @xmath88 must be larger than , or at least comparable to , @xmath89 to give an effective angular kick to the phase of @xmath85 .",
    "after this , the dynamics becomes somewhat complicated .",

    "our inclusion of the neutrino mass term does not make things more unstable .",
    "in addition to requiring that the origin is stable , we also have to worry whether the fields may get trapped in a minimum generated by the @xmath76-term @xmath86 . it is not easy to determine explicit constraints that ensure that such a minimum does not exist for a general combination of @xmath3 and @xmath4 directions , but the constraint for the pure @xmath3 direction is @xmath101 for the general case , we can check whether the a - term minima exist or not for a given set of parameters . on the other hand ,",
    "if the fields evade the minima dynamically , the constraints are not needed .",
    "but it is not clear in our model .    finally , we require @xmath102 for correct electroweak symmetry breaking in our vacuum .",
    "so far , we have analyzed our model and its dynamical behavior within the context of our ansatz that the only relevant fields are @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath100 and @xmath20 , assuming all other fields are zero .",

    "this is dangerous because it means that very deep non - mssm minima exist in our model .",
    "does this mean our assumption is invalid ?",
    "the answer will be no if we live in our vacuum and its life time is longer than the age of our universe .",
    "then two questions arise .",
    "the first is whether our field configuration will dynamically settle down into our vacuum , as opposed to the deeper non - mssm one .",
    "if the answer to this question is yes , so that we live in a false vacuum , the second question is what is the life time of our vacuum . to answer the second question first",
    ", the mssm has a large enough region of parameter space in which our vacuum is cosmologically stable so that we are safe @xcite .    returning to the first question ,",
    "one of the dangerous directions involves @xmath106 and @xmath107 . for simplicity , we restrict to a single generation .",

    "however , as discussed in section  [ end ] , the a - term @xmath77 and cross term @xmath78 induce a non - zero value for @xmath64 , which tends to stabilize @xmath112 via the term @xmath113 . thus , ignoring finite temperature effects which will also help to hold @xmath112 at zero , @xmath112 will be stable if @xmath114 the d - term contribution is not expected to be large because the field configuration will follow a direction close to d - flat , and in any case would be expected to be positive , and the second term is not expected to dominate as eq .",
    "( [ maghd ] ) makes it roughly the geometric mean between the first and third terms .",
    "thus one expects that eq .",
    "( [ qdm ] ) will be satisfied , i.e. @xmath112 is stable .",
    "we confirm this estimate using numerical simulations in the next section .    for the dangerous lepton direction @xmath115 we can apply the same argument as above with the substitutions @xmath116",
    "in this section we use numerical simulations of the homogeneous field dynamics to see the generation of the lepton asymmetry and check the stability of our ansatz .    for our initial conditions , we take @xmath117 , and @xmath59 and @xmath60 at the minimum of their potential . we take @xmath112 slightly displaced from the origin to test its stability .",
    "we then displace @xmath20 slightly from the origin at various angles , and follow the dynamics . to crudely mimic the transfer of energy from the initial homogeneous mode of @xmath20 to gradient energy of @xmath20 , which causes the homogeneous mode of @xmath20 to settle towards its minima , we add artificial damping acting on @xmath20 .",

    "we do not include any damping for the ad fields as it is less clear what form it takes .",
    "our numerical simulations show that @xmath112 is stable .",
    "thus the dynamics ensures that we do not fall into a deeper non - mssm minimum , and our ansatz and key assumption , eq .",
    "( [ lhumcon ] ) , are consistent .",
    "some of our numerical results are shown in figures  [ phi ] , [ ldyn ] and  [ av ] .",
    "= 4 in    = 4 in    = 4 in",
    "in the previous sections we showed that a lepton asymmetry can be generated in our model at the end of thermal inflation . however , there is a danger that this lepton number will be washed out by the continued action of the lepton violating operators . to avoid this",
    ", we need the amplitude of the lepton field to decrease , taking it into the conservative region of the potential .",
    "therefore , some form of damping for the homogeneous mode of the lepton field is required to preserve the asymmetry .",
    "note that hubble damping , which is usually used in ad baryogenesis scenarios , is negligible .",
    "there are several sources of damping .",
    "the first we can expect is the transfer of energy from the homogeneous mode to inhomogeneous modes , i.e. the build up of gradient energy , which is often called preheating .",
    "it is clear that a substantial amount of energy would be transferred in this way in the first few oscillations , but it is not clear how long it would take this process to reduce the homogeneous field amplitude by a substantial factor .",
    "friction induced by the thermal bath and decay are other sources of damping .",
    "we do nt attempt to analyze these damping processes in this paper .",
    "although we do not understand the details of the decay of the ad fields , we do know that it will complete while the flaton energy is still dominant , and will release enough thermal energy to restore the electroweak symmetry .",
    "assuming our lepton asymmetry survives until this stage , it will be converted to a baryon asymmetry by the usual electroweak sphaleron processes",
    ". finally , as the temperature drops to the gev scale , the flaton decay completes , releasing substantial entropy which dilutes the baryon asymmetry .",
    "thus , the final baryon asymmetry is given by @xmath134 as in eq .",
    "( [ madmti ] ) , we expect @xmath135 and as @xmath136 and @xmath137 to @xmath138 gev , we expect @xmath139 therefore , to get @xmath140 we require @xmath141 with perhaps @xmath142 being a central value .",
    "our baryogenesis scenario emerges from a fairly minimal extension of the mssm with superpotential of the form @xmath143 @xmath20 is a flaton field whose potential drives thermal inflation , solving the moduli problem . @xmath20 also naturally generates the @xmath1-term of the mssm when it acquires its intermediate scale vacuum expectation value .",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath144 represent some additional su(5 ) multiplets needed to hold the flaton at the origin during the thermal inflation . after the thermal inflation they acquire intermediate scale masses from the flaton vacuum expectation value .",
    "their effect on the renormalization group running of mssm parameters from the gut scale might provide a signature of our model .",
    "one could also consider embedding the peccei - quinn axion in the flaton sector .",
    "our model makes the key assumption that @xmath145 for our ad fields to become unstable near the end of thermal inflation .",
    "this violates a well known stability constraint @xcite , implying that there exists a deep non - mssm minimum in our model .",
    "this is potentially dangerous .",
    "however , we showed explicitly that the dynamics does not cause the fields to become trapped in this deeper minimum .",
    "it is also known that the time scale for quantum tunnelling from our vacuum to this deeper minimum is larger than the age of our universe for a wide range of parameters @xcite .",
    "so the above assumption is phenomenologically consistent and becomes a clear signature of our model which can be checked in future particle accelerator experiments .",
    "the outline of our baryogenesis scenario is as follows .",
    "we start with all fields at the origin during thermal inflation . as the temperature drops , near the end of thermal inflation , the @xmath3 flat direction rolls away from the origin",
    ". then , @xmath20 rolls away from the origin , ending the thermal inflation and inducing a nonzero value for @xmath42 . this non - zero value for @xmath42",
    "stabilizes some potentially dangerous quark and lepton field directions , shielding the dynamics from the deep non - mssm minima discussed above .",
    "when @xmath20 reaches of order its vacuum expectation value , the back - reaction of @xmath42 induces a lepton number violating cross - term which rotates the phase of @xmath3 generating a lepton number asymmetry .",
    "simultaneously , @xmath100 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are brought back in towards the origin due to the @xmath1-term generated by @xmath20 .",
    "we assume the generated asymmetry is conserved due to damping of the amplitude of the ad field oscillations by preheating , thermal friction and decay processes .",
    "while the oscillating flaton still dominates the energy density of the universe , the decay of the ad fields completes , partially reheating the universe to a temperature high enough to restore the electroweak symmetry .",
    "sphaleron processes then convert the lepton asymmetry into a baryon asymmetry",
    ". finally , the flaton decay completes at a temperature of order gev , diluting the baryon asymmetry to the observed value .    as described above , despite its minimal and strongly constrained structure , our model has good features for baryogenesis providing rich physical content .",
    "this is a very attractive feature of our model .",
    "one key topic for future work is a proper analysis of the damping and decay of the ad fields , which is crucial to the conservation of the generated lepton asymmetry .",
    "our numerical simulation was only intended to model the generation of our asymmetry and check the stability of our ansatz , and so only simulated homogeneous fields .",
    "thus it could not address the damping and decay issues .",
    "therefore , to complete the story , a full analysis of the damping and decay processes and an inhomogeneous simulation including decay products are required .",
    "we postpone this challenging task to future work .",

    "<S> modular cosmology is plagued by overproduction of unwanted relics , gravitinos and especially moduli , at relatively low energy scales . </S>",

    "<S> we propose a simple model in which the mssm plus neutrino mass term @xmath0 is supplemented by a minimal flaton sector to drive the thermal inflation , and make two crucial assumptions : the flaton vacuum expectation value generates the @xmath1-term of the mssm and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the second assumption is particularly interesting in that it violates a well known constraint , implying that there exists a nearby deep non - mssm vacuum , and provides a clear signature of our model which can be tested at future particle accelerators . </S>",
    "<S> we show that our model leads to thermal inflation followed by affleck - dine leptogenensis along the @xmath3 flat direction . </S>",
    "<S> a key feature of our leptogenesis scenario is that the @xmath4 flat direction is also induced to temporarily acquire a large value , playing a crucial role in the leptogenesis , as well as dynamically shielding the field configuration from the deep non - mssm minimum , ensuring that the fields relax into our mssm vacuum . </S>"
