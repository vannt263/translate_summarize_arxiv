    "in the study of population genetics models , it is of great importance to identify their stationary distributions .",

    ", we consider a problem of finding a class of generalized fleming ",
    "viot processes whose stationary distributions can be identified .",
    "as far as the first term on the right - hand side of ( [ 1.1 ] ) is concerned , its jump - type version has been discussed in population genetics as the generator of a model with `` occasional extreme reproduction '' .",
    "( see section  1.2 of @xcite for a comprehensive account . )",

    "recently , @xcite showed essentially that the second term of ( [ 1.3 ] ) is required when we additionally take a generalization of the mutation mechanism into account .",
    "our argument will be crucially based on this kind of relationship between the generalized fleming  viot process associated with a natural generalization of ( [ 1.3 ] ) and a certain ergodic mbi - process .",
    "that relationship can be reformulated as a factorization result on the level of generators and hence is expected to yield also an explicit connection between stationary distributions . in principle , the problems ( i )  and  ( ii ) can be considered in a unified way .",
    "nevertheless , we shall discuss ( i )  and  ( ii ) separately .",
    "this is mainly because the factorization identity will turn out to yield a correct answer only for certain restricted cases and in one dimension one can avoid its use by taking an analytic approach instead ( although this does not reveal clearly the mathematical structure underlying).=1    the organization of this paper is as follows .",
