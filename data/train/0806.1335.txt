    "cosmic ray showers can excite mechanical vibrations in a metallic cylinder at its resonance frequencies and can provide an accidental background for experiments searching gravitational waves ( gw ) : this possibility was suggested many years ago and a first search , ending with a null result , was carried out with room temperature weber type resonant bar detectors @xcite .    more recently , the cryogenic resonant gw detector nautilus has been equipped with shower detectors and the interaction of cosmic ray with the antenna has been studied in detail .",
    "the first detection of cosmic ray signals in a gw detector took place in 1998 in nautilus . during this run many events of very large amplitude were detected .",
    "this unexpected result suggested in 2002 the construction of a cosmic ray detector even for the explorer detector .",
    "in section [ tam ] we briefly recall the main features of the thermo - acoustic model ( tam ) , that successfully describes the interaction between a solid elastic resonator and a charged particle , or a beam of such particles ; some of these features are extended to the regime of superconducting metal for the elastic resonator .    in section [ cosm_descr ]",
    "we describe the nautilus and explorer cosmic ray detectors and we specialize the tam model to the interaction with cosmic rays computing the expected event rates .    in section [ antennas ]",
    "we describe the results of coincidence measurements between the output of each gw antenna and its respective cosmic ray monitor , in different periods of data taking : for nautilus during the year 1998 , with the antenna in superconductive state , and then in the years from 2003 to 2006 , while for explorer in the period from 2003 to 2006 .",
    "the data are interpreted with the help of some results obtained by the rap experiment .",
    "finally , some conclusions of this extended analysis are drawn : we show the good agreement of our data with the tam predictions and the consistency of data taken by two detectors with various different experimental setups ( temperature , bandwidth , readout and acquisition hardware and software ) . as a central result , the relevance of the conducting state of the antenna material on the strength of the interaction is proven .",
    "we have then learned that cosmic rays can also provide a good calibration source for resonant gw detectors , as they very closely mimic the signal expected by short bursts of gravitational waves , i.e. the tidal excitation of the longitudinal modes .",
    "the interaction of energetic charged particles with a normal mode of an extended elastic cylinder has been extensively studied over the years , both on the theoretical and on the experimental aspect .",
    "the first experiments aiming to detect mechanical oscillations in metallic targets due to impinging elementary particles were carried out by beron and hofstander as early as in 1969 @xcite .",
    "a few years later , strini et al .",
    "@xcite carried out an experiment with a small metallic cylinder and measured the cylinder oscillations .",
    "the authors compared the data against the tam ( thermo acoustic model ) in which the longitudinal vibrations are originated from the local thermal expansion caused by the warming up due to the energy lost by the particles crossing the material .",
    "in particular , the vibration amplitude is directly proportional to the ratio of two thermophysical parameters of the material , namely the thermal expansion coefficient and the specific heat at constant volume .",
    "the ratio of these two quantities appears in the definition of the grneisen parameter @xmath2 .",
    "it turns out that while the two thermophysical parameters vary with temperature , @xmath2 practically does not , provided the temperature is above the material superconducting @xmath3 state critical temperature .",
    "detailed calculations , successively refined by several authors @xcite agree in predicting , for the excitation energy @xmath4 of the fundamental vibrational mode of an aluminum cylindrical bar , the following equation : e=()^2[sin()]^2 [ eliub ] where @xmath5 is the bar length , @xmath6 the bar radius ,",
    "@xmath7 the length of the particle track inside the bar , @xmath8 the distance of the track mid point from one end of the bar , @xmath9 the angle between the particle track and the axis of the bar , @xmath10 the energy loss of the particle in the bar , @xmath11 the density , @xmath12 the longitudinal sound velocity in the material .",
    "this relation is valid for the material normal - conducting @xmath13 state and some authors ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) have extended the model to a super - conducting ( @xmath14 ) resonator , according to a scenario in which the vibration amplitude is due to two pressure sources , one due to @xmath15 transitions in small regions centered around the interacting particle tracks and the other due to thermal effects in these regions now in the @xmath16 state .",
    "it is important to note , at this point , that a gw bar antenna , used as particle detector , has characteristics very different from the usual particle detectors which are sensitive only to ionization losses @xcite@xcite : indeed an acoustic resonator can be seen as a zero threshold calorimeter , sensitive to a vast range of energy loss processes . +",
    "as anticipated in the introduction , the first detection of signals in a gw detector output due to cosmic ray events , took place in 1998 .",
    "the nautilus detector , a bar made of the aluminum alloy al 5056 was operated at a thermodynamic temperature @xmath17 k  @xcite , i.e. below the @xmath14 transition temperature @xmath18 . during this run , many events of unexpectedly large amplitude were detected .",
    "this result suggested an anomaly either in the model or in the cosmic ray interactions@xcite .",
    "however the observation was not confirmed in the 2001 run with nautilus at @xmath19 k  @xcite and therefore we made the hypothesis that the unexpected behavior be due to the superconducting state of the material .",
    "an experiment ( rap ) @xcite was then planned at the infn frascati national laboratory to study the vibration amplitude of a small al 5056 bar caused by the hits of a 510 mev electron beam .",
    "the experiment was also motivated by the lack of complete knowledge of the thermophysical parameters of the alloy al 5056 at low and ultra - low temperatures .",
    "we summarize here the main results obtained by the experiment :    ( a ) in al 5056 at @xmath20  @xcite rap measured a ratio , @xmath21 , between the measured vibration amplitudes and the expectations based on the thermo - acoustic model of eq.[eliub ] using the tam parameters known for pure aluminum ;    \\(b ) the experimental verification , made on a pure niobium bar , that the amplitude depends on the material conduction state  @xcite and    \\(c ) for al 5056 at @xmath22 k a ratio , @xmath23 , between the measured amplitudes at @xmath24 and @xmath25  @xcite has been measured .",
    "while @xmath26 can be considered a small correction due to our inexact knowledge of relevant thermophysical parameters of our material , a value of @xmath27 so different from unity indicates that more complex interactions , as mentioned above , take place in the superconducting alloy .",
    "the gw detector nautilus@xcite is located in frascati ( italy ) national laboratories of infn , at about 200 meters above sea level .",
    "it is equipped with a cosmic ray detection telescope made of seven layers of gas detectors ( streamer tubes ) for a total of 116 counters @xcite .",
    "three superimposed layers , each with an area of @xmath28 , are located above the cryostat .",
    "four superimposed layers are below the cryostat , each with area of @xmath29 .",
    "the signal from each counter is digitized to measure the charge that is proportional to the number of particles .",
    "the detector is capable of measuring particle densities up to @xmath30 without large saturation effects . during normal",
    "runs only showers are detected , with a typical threshold of the order of @xmath31 in the lower detectors .",
    "single particles , cosmic rays muons , are collected every day in short runs , with the aim of calibrating the detectors .",
    "the systematic error on the absolute number of particles crossing the apparatus is of the order of 25% . the cosmic ray and",
    "the antenna data acquisition systems are independent .",
    "a gps clock is used to synchronize the antenna and cosmic ray acquisitions .",
    "the time resolution is limited to 0.2 ms by the antenna adc 5 khz sampling .",
    "the gw detector explorer @xcite is located in cern ( geneva - ch ) at about 430 meters above sea level .",
    "scintillators counters were installed at explorer in 2002 , using scrap equipment recovered after the lep shutdown . above the cryostat",
    "there is a single layer of 11 scintillators for a total area of @xmath32 . below the cryostat",
    "there are two layers of 4 counters each , with a total area of @xmath33 .",
    "each scintillator is seen by two photomultipliers ( 56avp ) .",
    "the signals from the anode and from the last dynode of each photomultiplier are digitized to measure the total charge .",
    "no large saturation effects occur in the dynodes up to particle densities of the order of @xmath34 .",
    "the typical trigger threshold during normal run is of the order of @xmath35 in the lower detectors .",
    "the detector is calibrated using cosmic ray muons as in nautilus .",
    "corrections are applied to take into account the scintillators attenuation lengths and the conversion of photons inside the scintillators .",
    "the cosmic ray and the antenna data acquisition systems are independent , as in nautilus .",
    "similarly , a gps clock is used to synchronize the acquisitions .    in order to compare the shower particle densities measured by the scintillators and by the streamer tubes , we have installed two scintillators , equal to the ones used in the top layer of explorer , above the nautilus cryostat .",
    "the scintillators measured numbers of particles @xmath36 larger than streamer tubes for showers particle densities around @xmath37 .",
    "most of the high energy events are due to electromagnetic showers .",
    "the rate of electromagnetic air showers ( eas ) is computed starting from the empirical relation due to g. cocconi @xcite    h()=k^-  events / day [ rscia ]    where @xmath38 is the density of secondaries in an eas , measured in units of number of charged particles per square meter , @xmath39 @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "this relation holds at sea level and in absence of absorbing material .",
    "the nautilus antenna is located inside a building with a very small amount of matter in the roof , while explorer is in a normal building with concrete roof .",
    "concrete has 50 mev critical energy , to be compared to a critical energy 88 mev for air ; therefore we expect in the explorer detector an increase of the electromagnetic showers particle density due to the different critical energies and to its above sea level higher location .    )",
    "( continuous line ) , the rate measured by the explorer scintillators ( squares ) and by the nautilus streamer tubes ( circles ) .",
    "the open symbols refer to the detectors below the cryostat , the filled symbols are for the detectors above .",
    "the explorer data are corrected for the @xmath42 systematic difference in the number of particle measured with scintillators with respect to streamer tubes .",
    "the difference in the rates of the detectors above the cryostats is due to the different altitudes of frascati and cern and to the presence of a roof in the explorer building .",
    "the rates in the bottom detectors are also influenced by the different distribution of iron , copper and aluminum in the cryostats .",
    "[ corate ] , width=528,height=288 ]    the integral distribution of the showers measured with both explorer and nautilus cosmic ray detectors is shown in fig.[corate ] . in this figure",
    "we have ( arbitrarily ) taken nautilus as reference : therefore we have shifted the explorer points in order to correct the systematic @xmath42 error between streamer and scintillators .",
    "the nautilus data of the detector above the cryostat are in agreement with the prediction of eq.[rscia ] within the @xmath43 systematic error given by the particle density measurement . the difference between nautilus and explorer and between detectors over and under the cryostats are due to several , already mentioned effects : the differences in altitude of the experimental locations ( 230 m ) , the presence of a concrete roof in the explorer building and the materials in the cryostats .",
    "the signal expected in a gw detector like nautilus , a bar 3 m in length and 0.6 m diameter , as a consequence of the interaction of a particle releasing an energy ( w in gev units ) is @xcite , according to relation ( [ eliub ] ) :    e~10 ^ -9w^2 ^ 2 [ k [ [ ww ] where the bar oscillation energy @xmath4 is expressed , as usual in the antenna jargon , in kelvin units ( @xmath44 ) , the numerical constant is the value computed using the linear expansion coefficient and the specific heat of pure aluminum at 4 k and @xmath45 takes , as described in the previous section , either value @xmath46 above the @xmath14 transition temperature or @xmath47 for superconductive al 5056 .",
    "the constant @xmath48 applies if the energy is released in the bar center .",
    "if the energy is uniformly distributed along the bar , as in the case of eas showers , this value is reduced by a factor 2 .",
    "the cosmic ray event rate in nautilus has been evaluated considering three different event categories : pure electromagnetic showers , showers produced by muons and showers produced by hadrons in the bar .",
    "we use eq.[ww ] with the correction @xmath49 for the response of an aluminum al 5056 bar in the normal state .    the rate of the eas and the energy deposited by an eas has been computed starting from eqs .",
    "[ rscia],[ww ] with the following assumptions :    \\1 ) no particle absorbed ( all particles go through the bar ) : indeed the radiation length in the bar is small compared to the total radiation length in the atmosphere .",
    "\\2 ) the energy loss for a single particle is computed assuming ionization energy losses for electrons having the aluminum critical energy .",
    "\\3 ) we used the showers angular distribution as reported in@xcite .",
    "\\4 ) we neglected the contribution of hadrons that could be present in the core of the showers .    under the previous assumptions and using the density @xmath38 of secondaries we obtain @xcite :    e=^2  4.7  10 ^ -10 ^2 [ k [ [ theo ]    the production of the showers due to muon and hadrons was computed using the geant package@xcite , developed at cern , to simulate nautilus and the corsika@xcite montecarlo , as input to geant , to simulate the effect of the hadrons produced by the cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere , assuming a cosmic ray `` light '' composition .",
    "the montecarlo simulation reflects 1 year of data taking .",
    "the results are shown in table [ table_1 ] .",
    "the rate of the the events scales as @xmath50 .",
    "this is because the cosmic ray integral spectrum is well described by a power law @xmath51 with @xmath52 for cosmic ray primaries up to the so called `` knee '' at @xmath53 and @xmath54 at higher energies .",
    "the energy in the first longitudinal mode @xmath4 ( first column of table [ table_1 ] ) is proportional to the square of the absorbed energy w.    . estimated rate ( events / day ) of antenna excitations due to cosmic rays in nautilus as a function of the vibrational energy of the longitudinal fundamental mode that such events can produce .",
    "the value at @xmath55 is obtained extrapolating from the lowest energy values .",
    "the values in the second column are the energies absorbed by the bar computed from eq .",
    "[ theo ] , with the assumption of energy uniformly distributed , and @xmath49 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for small signals we have found that the acoustic gw detector response well agrees with the predictions based on the thermo - acoustic model , once the corrections to this model , provided by a dedicate experiment@xcite@xcite@xcite , are applied .",
    "the large signals are the kind of events that can represent a background noise for current gravitational wave detectors .",
    "we found the rate of large signals to be in good agreement with the predictions , given the large uncertainty in such predictions .",
    "we notice that in explorer we have a higher rate than in nautilus , and this is due to the the concrete roof and to the difference in altitude between frascati and geneva .",
    "we have shown that the unexpected large events detected in 1998 with nautilus at t=0.14 kelvin were due to the superconductive state .",
    "cosmic rays noise could become an important noise in higher sensitivity detectors , namely in superconductive state , and this noise should be taken into account in possible future detectors of improved sensitivity , both acoustic @xcite@xcite and interferometric . as shown in this paper , cosmic rays can provide an useful tool to have a continuous monitor and calibration of the acoustic gravitational wave detectors . as an example fig.[ristempi ] shows the antenna time resolution measured using the cosmic ray showers collected during the explorer run .",
    "very important is the fact that the observation of cosmic rays demonstrates that the detectors , both hardware and software , are indeed able to detect vibrations as small as @xmath56 .",
