    "scandium hydride was first identified experimentally by smith @xcite , who recorded the absorption spectra of various transition metal hydrides ( sch , tih , vh , nih , coh and deuterated isotopologues ) in the region 17700 to 18300  @xmath7 .",
    "no detailed analysis of the spectrum was reported but it was remarked that a triplet ground state was expected .",
    "later studies showed that the ground state of sch is actually @xmath8 , with a low - lying @xmath9 .",
    "early studies using restricted open - shell hartree - fock ( rohf ) @xcite , generalised valence bond theory @xcite and empirically - fitted pseudopotentials @xcite all incorrectly predicted a @xmath9 ground state , with the @xmath8 generally lying about 2000  @xmath7 higher up .",
    "these studies considered the six electronic terms correlating upon dissociation with ground state atoms ( dissociation channel labelled 1 in table  [ tbl.sc.atom.experiment ] , leading to @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) ; it was remarked @xcite that the bonding of the molecular terms other than @xmath8 is due to the sc(@xmath13 ) and h(@xmath14 ) orbitals , while the scandium @xmath15 orbitals are relatively unaffected with respect to the atomic state @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the bonding of @xmath8 was put down to @xmath16 bonding @xcite .",
    "the different bonding character of the @xmath8 term is probably one of the reasons why an extensive treatment of electron correlation is necessary to obtain the right ordering of the electronic terms .",
    "bauschlicher and walch @xcite were the first to correctly predict @xmath8 lying below @xmath9 by performing full - valence multi - configuration self - consistent - field ( mcscf ) calculations .",
    "jeung and kouteck @xcite studied the same six electronic terms using pseudopotentials and truncated mrci and confirmed a ground @xmath8 term close to equilibrium ( @xmath17 ) , although for longer bond lengths @xmath9 becomes lower in energy .",
    "note that all these studies kept the scandium outer - core @xmath18 electrons uncorrelated and often did not include relativistic corrections .",
    "et al _ produced a series of papers @xcite studying in great detail sch and sch@xmath19 using multi - reference configuration interaction ( mrci ) ; in particular their final paper @xcite constitutes the most complete theoretical study of sch currently available .",
    "these authors confirmed that @xmath8 is the ground state when correlation effects are included ; they also found that correlation of the sc(@xmath20 ) semi - core electrons leads to large energy shifts , strongly stabilising the @xmath8 term with respect to the others and swapping the order of some of the excited states .",
    "they used basis sets similar in size to cc - pvtz .",
    "more recent theoretical studies considered sch in the context of calibration studies of transition metal molecules using density function theory @xcite , but they focused on equilibrium properties of very few terms and are of little relevance for us . an exception is the very recent study by hubert _",
    "et al _ @xcite in which a detailed study of the ground @xmath8 and of two excited terms @xmath12 around equilibrium was presented and a modification of the coupled cluster method called general active space coupled cluster ( gas - cc ) was used .",
    "the only theoretical dipole moment data available for sch are those by anglada _",
    "et al _ @xcite and by chong _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "experimentally a study by bernard _",
    "et al _ @xcite reported three new bands ascribed to sch and scd in the region 11600 to 12700  @xmath7 , but no detailed analysis or assignments were made due to the limited resolution and complexity of the spectra .",
    "more recently ram and bernath @xcite reported two detailed emission spectra analyses for sch and scd . in these studies they reported on singlet - singlet bands in regions from 5400 to 20500  @xmath7 assigned to transitions between 8 electronic terms , namely @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "two additional strong bands near 11620 and 12290  @xmath7 and two weaker bands near 12660 and 16845  @xmath7 were recorded but only incompletely analysed ; the band near 11620  @xmath7 was conjectured to be due to a transition to the low - lying @xmath9 term from a @xmath29 term .",
    "le and steimle @xcite reported more recently a detailed experimental study of the @xmath21@xmath25 band around 16850  @xmath7 , where also the electric dipole moments of sch in its @xmath21 and @xmath30 states were obtained using optical stark spectroscopy . very recently , mukund _",
    "et al _ @xcite reported the observation of sch emission bands at about 17900  @xmath7 , ascribed to the @xmath31  @xmath29 ",
    "@xmath32  @xmath9 triplet - triplet transitions .",
    "this paper focuses on the six low - energy electronic states dissociating to ground state sc and h atoms . of the various experimentally observed bands",
    "@xcite only @xmath33 ",
    "@xmath34 is considered in the present study , although experiment is used for the empirical refinement of the potential energy curves of the singlet terms @xmath35 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 as well .",
    "as part of the exomol project @xcite , whose aim is to produce comprehensive line lists for hot , astrophysically - important molecules , we have been constructing rovibrational and rovibronic line lists for a number of diatomic species @xcite .",
    "however , so far none of these have contained a transition metal ( tm ) .",
    "the richness of the spectrum of tm - containing diatomics makes their opacity particularly important for astrophysical studies @xcite but treating their rovibronic spectrum _",
    "ab initio _ is very challenging .",
    "scandium hydride is the lightest tm molecule and for this reason constitutes a useful benchmark system for theoretical studies of such systems .",
    "scandium hydride has received comparatively little attention with respect to other transition metal hydrides such as feh or nih , in all probability because of the low abundance of scandium .",
    "scandium is in fact the rarest of fourth - period transition metals ( sc - zn ) in the solar system @xcite , although it is more abundant than all heavier elements starting from the fifth period .",
    "the study presented here on sch constitutes a first step in the _ ab initio _ calculation of ro - vibronic spectra of tm - containing molecule .",
    "we perform a series of _ ab initio _",
    "calculations on both the scandium atom and sch and use these to produce a line list of scandium hydride line positions and intensities which is reasonably complete in the region up to 12  000  @xmath7 .",
    "as a preliminary test we studied in some detail the scandium atom using complete active space self consistent field ( casscf ) and internally - contracted mrci calculations using the program molpro @xcite .",
    "we collected in table  [ tbl.sc.atom.experiment ] reference energy levels of the scandium atom up to about 20  000  @xmath7 , along with the sch molecular terms correlating adiabatically with the various atomic states ; this information serves as an indication of which molecular terms are expected to be low - lying ; the rationale is that for transition - metal hydrides the hydrogen atom constitutes a relatively small perturbation of the atomic energy levels , so that molecular terms correlating with high - energy atomic products should be high - lying too .",
    "the lowest dissociation channel is separated by about 11  500  @xmath7 from others , and in fact the six electronic terms correlating to it are lowest - lying and most theoretical studies concentrated on them .",
    "the dissociation channels 1 to 10 reported in table  [ tbl.sc.atom.experiment ] lead altogether to 60 electronic molecular terms ; that is , there are 60 energy curves in absence of spin - orbit splitting , which become 155 in presence of spin - orbit splitting . of these",
    ", only eight have been characterised experimentally @xcite .",
    "very probably many of the remaining molecular energy curves are repulsive ( i.e. , have no minimum ) and therefore do not concern us here . in any case great complexity and strong perturbations in the observed spectra are expected .",
    "this is typical of open - shell transition metal molecules . in the following",
    "we consider the excitation energies from the ground @xmath36 term to the two lowest - energy excited terms , namely @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "we expect that errors of computed molecular excitation energies are comparable with the corresponding error in the atomic case .",

    "a hot line list containing pure rotational , ro - vibrational and vibronic transitions for sch was generated using new _ ab initio _ potential energy , dipole moment , spin - orbit , and electronic angular moment curves obtained at a high level of theory .",
    "the work was performed with a view to astrophysical applications .",
    "the analysis of the importance of different absorption bands for the opacities of sch is presented .",
    "the complexity of the electronic structure problem when transition metals are involved means that the accuracy of these calculations is much worse than what is normally achievable for small molecules containing light main - group elements . to help mitigate this problem ,",
    "it is desirable to utilise experimental data to improve the accuracy of the results .",
    "we have done this for the singlet states .",
    "however , for transitions involving triplet states there are no measured data for us to use : for example , the recent triplet - triplet measurements by mukund _ et al _ @xcite in the 17  940 @xmath7  region lie well above our calculated transitions and have not reported any absolute energies of the lower @xmath43 electronic state .",
    "besides , their only parameter with which we can directly compare , @xmath44 , appears to be too low to be fully trusted .",
    "thus for the triplet states we used the @xmath45 valued taken from our _ ab initio _ calculations , which may be in error by up to a few thousands @xmath7 , implying that the entire bands may be erroneously shifted by similar amounts .",
    "also , structure due to perturbations in both the singlet and triplet manifolds are dependent on the potential energy curve separations and therefore may not be reproduced accurately .",
    "however we expect that our line list to be quantitatively accurate enough for the singlet state energies and to provide a detailed spectral structure of individual bands to be useful .",
