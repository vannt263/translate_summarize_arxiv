    "the proper entanglement measure is the eof . using the concurrence for this purpose could cause confusion",
    "when investigating entanglement of systems with dimensionality @xmath17 for @xmath18 since in that case the definition of concurrence is not unique .",
    "also in some cases , e.g. in  @xcite , the negativity  @xcite as an entanglement measure is preferred .",
    "the reason is that it is easier to calculate ( tracing over a partially transposed density matrix ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the negativity does not coincide with the entropy of entanglement introduced above for pure bipartite states where it is the unique measure of entanglement  @xcite .",
    "rather recently  @xcite , connection of the negativity with the concurrence ( and thus to the eof that coincides with the entropy of entanglement for pure bipartite states ) was discovered in terms of convex roof construction .",
    "anyhow , in this paper the particular forms of the density matrices allow us to calculate the eof directly from the concurrence .",
    "the second note concerns the term schmidt number .",
    "it characterizes the degree of entanglement of input states but does not uniquely determine the behavior after the interaction .",
    "in other words , even if two input states have the same schmidt number , for example two bell states , their evolution and thus entanglement after the interaction may be completely different .",

    "there is a @xmath39 that depends on @xmath40 such that for the subinterval @xmath41 the minimum value of the eof is zero and the local maxima ( revivals ) are always smaller than the initial value for @xmath42 and equal for @xmath43 .",
    "thus , the eof of the atomic entangled states is reduced in the presence of thermal light . as the temperature increases the temporal width of the revivals decreases .",
    "a brief inspection of the picture reveals other interesting aspects of interacting light with this family of states @xmath3 in the second interval of @xmath1 , @xmath44 . due to the fact that @xmath30 is a dark state",
    "the behavior is completely different .",
    "the eof exhibits very soft oscillations and is never smaller than its initial value .",
    "we thus see that in this region , the resulting state is stable under the interaction with thermal light",
    ". this could be an important hint for quantum engineers ( and protocol designers generally ) telling them that there exists an important class of initial atomic states where the interaction with a thermal field means not only no loss of entanglement but even its enhancement without strong fluctuations .",
    "the works presented so far on this topic ( e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) were limited only to input atomic states with small values of the schmidt number @xmath45 and recognized the presence of the dark state but do not discuss the stability of entanglement in the whole range of @xmath1 .",

    "( [ rho_phi ] ) have a particulary simple form    [ rho_phi_n0 ] @xmath46    by examining the density matrix for @xmath47 we may exactly see the influence of the vacuum fluctuations on a factorized input state .",
    "we see that there is a @xmath48 probability of finding the system with both atoms in their ground state and a single photon , while there is a @xmath48 probability that this photon has been reabsorbed by one of the atoms leaving the atomic system in the entangled state . as a consequence",
    ", spontaneous decay may be regarded as a causative mechanism for inducing entanglement between the two two - level atoms when their initial state @xmath3 is practically unentangled ( @xmath49 ) or to enhance it for different @xmath1 in the interval @xmath50 .",
    "the fact that eof exhibits strong oscillations as already illustrated may limit even its evaluation .",
    "evaluation of the entanglement requires knowledge of the matrix elements and these can not be determined just from one copy of an unknown quantum state .",
    "one possibility is to have many copies of the same unknown state and perform quantum state tomography .",
    "recent findings show that the tomography is not necessary  @xcite but still does hold that it is not possible to measure the entanglement from just one copy of a state .",
    "besides , if the average number of photons is so large that the time window for picking the desired state is too long compared to the length of the oscillations , the measurement could be interpreted as a random pick from the set of all possible outputs and a proper time average must be performed .",
    "let us study this question for the electromagnetic field initially in the vacuum state as an illustration . in this simple case ,",
    "the natural period is determined by the commeasurable rabi frequencies @xmath51 and @xmath52",
    "@xmath53 the resulting eof can be seen in the upper plot of fig .",
    "[ fig_aver ] and , we are able to confirm the qualitative conclusions about the entanglement behavior based on fig .",
    "[ eofb_phi_n0 ] for the averaged eof . as mentioned above",
    ", we can observe nonzero entanglement for initially factorized states .",
    "for entangled states with @xmath41 the averaged eof is lower than for the input states . in general , for the remaining @xmath1 the eof average is higher than the initial value of the eof .",
    "the extension of this averaging process for the case of an interaction with thermal light with @xmath42 requires the identification of a natural time scale since in this case an infinite number of the incommensurable rabi frequencies @xmath54 determines the evolution of the system .",
    "one such scale could be found by the following procedure .",
    "writing the summations in the expression of @xmath55 in an integral form using the abel - plana formula , it can be shown that the adimensional parameter @xmath56 is especially important to understand the evolution of the system .",
    "in fact , it can be used to define a natural time @xmath57 to distinguish short and long time effects of the interaction ( see appendix for more details ) .",
    "if the average procedure from above is applied , @xmath58 could also be used for this purpose .",
    "following the same reasoning as in the previous subsection , but for an initial state of the form @xmath59 interacting with light in a thermal state  ( [ light ] ) , we arrive to a reduced density matrix with the structure @xmath60 the particular expressions for the matrix elements are given in appendix .",
    "as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ eofb_psi_n0 ] , in this case a resonant thermal electromagnetic field is not able to induce , in general , atomic entanglement for input factorized atomic states , nor to enhance it for initial already entangled states .",
    "an exception is provided for the states with @xmath61 . there , a very slight eof enhancement is observed for @xmath62 .",
    "this effect is discussed at length in ref .",
    "@xcite and present , but barely observable , in fig .",
    "[ eofb_psi_n0 ] . for the other values of @xmath1 , at most , partially entangled input states exhibit revivals of the eof .",
    "thus , in comparison to the input state @xmath3 , the entanglement properties of a thermal field are not so striking .",
    "this qualitative observation is confirmed for @xmath43 by the mixture calculation in the spirit of the previous section .",
    "it gives us @xmath63 the resulting eof is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_aver ] ( bottom plot ) .",
    "we see that in the mixture sense , there is not only a separable output for initially unentangled states , as discussed above , but also for some of the input partially entangled states .",
    "also , if we compare the eof for the initial state ( dash dotted line ) and evolved state ( continuous line ) the output states are much less entangled in general .    nevertheless , returning to the evolved state  ( [ rho_psi ] ) , another interesting aspect appears .",
    "( [ rho_psi ] ) can be written as @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 and both states can be unambiguously discriminated . to show this ,",
    "let us consider a projectively measuring apparatus with three possible outputs .",
    "two of them project into orthogonal subspaces spanned by @xmath67 and @xmath68 and the third one is the complement .",
    "then , from the form of  ( [ psi_out ] ) it follows that if we do not detect anything on the first and the second output the state is in the required maximally entangled state @xmath69 .",
    "the probability of this procedure is given by the parameter @xmath70 .",
    "thus , no additional quantum resource for the discrimination is needed .",
    "intact we introduce an auxiliary qubit @xmath71 and the unitary matrix @xmath72 where in @xmath73 @xmath74 and @xmath24 is a control and a target qubit , respectively .",
    "this is useful for non - demolition discrimination between @xmath75 and @xmath76 since under this transformation we get @xmath77 .",
    "so that , by a projective measurement on the ancilla , @xmath75 and @xmath76 can be unambigously discriminated without destroying them . ]",
    "therefore , even if the eof is zero ( i.e. when an output state is separable ) the entangled pair can be extracted in terms of postselection . also , it is interesting that the maximum value of @xmath70 is almost the same not only for different input states ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_bcoeff1 ] ) but also for different average photon numbers of thermal light .",
    "it is worth remarking that the higher photon average number is used the less fluctuating the parameter @xmath70 we get .",
    "this constant character of @xmath70 is broken only for the case of a zero photon field where , not surprisingly , for an input state @xmath78 we can not extract a maximally entangled state by any means , see eq .",
    "( [ average_over_gt1 ] ) .",
    "note that a similar procedure can not be applied to the resulting state in eq .",
    "( [ rho_phi ] ) from the previous subsection .",
    "there , we are not able to find a decomposition of a density matrix in the form @xmath79 as in the current case , which ensures that if two arbitrary density matrices are positive the third must be so .",
    "in this work , we have explored the possibility of preserving or enhancing entanglement between two atoms after their interaction with a thermal field .",
    "we have investigated the interaction for two kinds of initial atomic states @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "although this physical system had been discussed previously , new interesting phenomena have been found and the already reported results have been confirmed . for the initial state @xmath3 , we observe a very different behavior after the interaction with the thermal field for two distinguished intervals of input states .",
    "qualitatively , for almost the whole range @xmath82 , the eof is decreased while for the remaining input states there are oscillations in the eof so that they are never smaller than their initial value .",
    "this result is more significant at low temperatures , hence , the entanglement enhancement mechanism is induced by spontaneous decay .",
    "for the second family of input states parameterized by @xmath4 , there is no entanglement enhancement for almost any @xmath1 . in this case",
    ", the entanglement is generally degraded matching our intuitive conception of an interaction between a correlated pairs of qubits and thermal light .",
    "nevertheless , the output atomic density matrix can be decomposed into @xmath83 and a partially entangled mixed state , both of them living in mutually orthogonal subspaces .",
    "thus they can be discriminated with zero probability of error .",
    "if we consider that this holds for all @xmath1 when @xmath84 is sufficiently high , it follows that we are able to extract the maximally entangled state @xmath85 even if the input is a factorized state and the output is in a separable form .",
    "we may conclude that we have at disposal a probabilistic source of maximally entangled atomic pairs , when our deposit is just a sufficiently hot thermal light with two atoms in a factorized state .    in current experiments with trapped ions ,",
    "the energies involved in the transitions compared with room temperatures are such that @xmath86 for the innsbruck group ( @xmath87 nm atomic transition in @xmath88ca@xmath89 )  @xcite and @xmath90 for the nist group ( @xmath91be@xmath89 at @xmath92 ghz )  @xcite .",
    "thus , one would expect that the former is a good scenario for testing the predictions made for the initial state @xmath3 , in particular , the entanglement enhancement .",
    "meanwhile , the nist group parameters could be appropriate to study the possibility of stabilized postselection of the maximally entangled state described for the interaction of thermal resonant light with @xmath4 .          with the help of the inverse transformation from the bare state to the dressed state basis , we rewrite the initial density matrix determined by the atomic state @xmath3 and a thermal single - mode field @xmath94,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath95\\exp{(-n\\hbar\\omega / kt)}$ ] .",
