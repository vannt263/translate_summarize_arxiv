    "motivated by recent discoveries of interesting multiorbital superconductors , unconventional pairing mechanism driven by the orbital degrees of freedom has attracted increasing attention . for example , in fese families and some heavy fermion superconductors , the superconductivity ( sc ) appears next to the non - magnetic orbital order phase .",
    "such phase diagram indicates the significant role of the orbital fluctuations on the pairing mechanism .    from a theoretical point of view , it has been a big challenge to explain the emergence of the orbital order / fluctuations based on the realistic multiorbital hubbard models microscopically .",
    "in fact , only the spin fluctuations develop whereas the orbital fluctuations remain small within the conventional mean - field - level approximations , such as the random - phase - approximation ( rpa ) and the fluctuation - exchange ( flex ) approximation @xcite .",
    "thus , non - magnetic orbital order is failed to be explained based on the mean - field - level approximations .",
    "the reason for this failure would be that the interplay between orbital and spin fluctuations , which is described by the vertex correction ( vc ) , is totally neglected in the rpa and flex .",
    "recently , the orbital order in fe - based superconductors has been naturally explained by taking the aslamazov - larkin vc ( al - vc ) into account @xcite .    in order to study the vcs ,",
    "the functional - renormalization - group ( frg ) is a very powerful and reliable theoretical method .",
    "both the charge - channel and spin - channel vcs are calculated unbiased way by solving the rg equation , since the particle - particle and particle - hole channels are included on the same footing without violating the pauli principle .",
    "using the frg theory , strong orbital fluctuation emerges in two - orbital hubbard models in the presence of moderate spin fluctuations , as revealed in refs .",
    "these frg studies confirmed the validity of the orbital fluctuation mechanism driven by the orbital - spin mode - coupling due to the al - vc @xcite .",
    "theoretically , it is natural to expect that the developed orbital fluctuations mediate the pairing formation .",
    "the orbital fluctuations can induce not only the singlet sc ( ssc ) , but also the triplet sc ( tsc ) . by performing the frg theory for the multiorbital models for sr@xmath5ruo@xmath6 , in which the tsc ( @xmath7 k ) is expected to be realized @xcite , orbital - fluctuation - mediated tsc has been proposed . in the frequently - used migdal - eliashberg ( me ) approximation ,",
    "the ssc pairing interaction is @xmath8 , and the tsc pairing interaction is @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the bare coulomb interaction matrix for the charge ( spin ) channel @xcite . within the me approximation ,",
    "spin - fluctuation - mediated ssc is expected when @xmath11 and @xmath12 are comparable , because of the factor @xmath13 for @xmath11 in the ssc pairing interaction . however ,",
    "this expectation is not guaranteed beyond the me approximation since @xmath14 may be enlarged by the vc at low energies , which is actually realized as we explain in the present paper .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze the two - orbital hubbard model for the @xmath15-bands in sr@xmath5ruo@xmath6 by using the frg theory .",
    "the aim of the present study is to confirm the realization condition for the orbital - fluctuation - mediated sc by going beyond the me approximation . for this purpose",
    ", we solve the gap equation by including the vc for the bare electron - boson coupling ( ebc ) , which we call the @xmath0-vc . due to the @xmath0-vc ,",
    "the effective ebc for the charge ( spin ) channel , @xmath16 , deviates from the bare coulomb interaction @xmath10 . by applying the frg theory , we find the relation @xmath17 due to the charge - channel @xmath0-vc in the presence of moderate spin fluctuations .",
    "in contrast , @xmath18 is significantly suppressed by the spin channel @xmath0-vc at low energies . for these reasons",
    ", orbital - fluctuation - mediated sc will be realized in various multiorbital systems , such as in fe - based superconductors and sr@xmath5ruo@xmath6 .",
    "we stress that the phonon - mediated attractive pairing is also enlarged by the factor @xmath19 .",
    "the fermi liquid theory tells that ( i ) the enhancement of the orbital susceptibility and ( ii ) that of the orbital - fluctuation - mediated pairing interaction are caused by the same @xmath0-vc .",
    "this fact means that both ( i ) and ( ii ) are realized simultaneously .",
    "this expectation has been confirmed by the present frg study .",
