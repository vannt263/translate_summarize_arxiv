    "the time window appears to be long enough to consider that , by the end of it , the system is at  or at least close to  the stationary state .",

    "the 1.5-ms time window of our experiment is much larger than the experimentally determined lifetime of the 70s state , which is measured by using a depumping technique @xcite that selectively depumps the 70s state via the fast decaying 6p state .",
    "this allows us to determine , as a function of time after the excitation pulse , both the total rydberg population with @xmath102 by field ionzation as well as the population of the 70s state alone , for which we find a lifetime @xmath103 . for the purposes of this work we assume that the migration from the 70s state to nearby rydberg states by black - body radiation essentialy works as a loss mechanism from the 70s state and should not influence the main features of the crossover behaviour we observe , especially close to the critical point , where the number of excitations is small",
    "previous theoretical work has shown that in a driven system of rydberg atoms the presence of strong dephasing noise leads to a rapid decay of the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix , which results in an effective dynamics that proceeds along classically accessible states and is governed by the following rate equation @xmath104 |p(t)\\rangle   \\label{dynamics } + \\sum_{k=1}^n ( \\gamma_k+\\kappa ) \\left[\\sigma_-^k - n_k \\right ] |p(t)\\rangle\\ ] ] where @xmath33 , @xmath35 being the probability of configuration @xmath34 at time @xmath36 @xcite . here",

    "the ( de)excitation operator @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) acting on @xmath34 creates ( annihiliates ) an excitation if @xmath107 was in the ground state ( rydberg state ) in @xmath110 , yielding zero otherwise . while the decay rate @xmath22 is constant , the configuration - dependent operator - valued ( de)excitation rates are given by @xmath111^{-1 } \\label{rates}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the rabi frequency , @xmath112 is the dephasing rate , @xmath13 is the value of the detuning and @xmath113 is the dispersion coefficient of the van der waals interactions .     as a function of the distance to a rydberg excitations @xmath114 for different detuning values",
    "@xmath13 ( see legend ) . ]",
    "the detuning @xmath13 plays a vital role in the excitation dynamics .",
    "this is most clearly seen in a two - atom configuration , by inspecting the excitation rate of an atom as a function of its distance @xmath114 to an excited atom in the rydberg state .",
    "when the distance is equal to the _ facilitating radius _ @xmath115 , the rate reaches a maximum @xmath38 . in fig .",
    "[ fig1sm ] we show @xmath116 normalized by @xmath53 as a function of @xmath114 for the experimental values @xmath117 and @xmath14 mhz , and several values of @xmath13 .",
    "it is clear how the larger the detuning , the narrower the facilitating region and the smaller the rate for a spontaneous ( de)excitation @xmath118 $ ] that is achieved for large @xmath114 .",
    "we experimentally determine @xmath57 by off - resonantly exciting rydberg atoms with negative rather than positive detuning . in this way",
    ", there is no facilitation mechanism ( for the repulsive 70s state used in our experiments ) , and hence only single excitations are created at a rate @xmath57 . from the total rate of excitations",
    "measured we obtain the single - particle value by dividing by the number of atoms in the interaction volume defined by the size of the mot and the waist of the blue leaser beam . in order to determine @xmath57 close to the critical point for the data reported in the main text , we performed this experiment with @xmath119 khz and @xmath120 mhz and found @xmath121 hz .",

    "in this section we substantiate the remarks that appear in the main text about the effects of quenched disorder on the dynamics .",
    "we shall take a one - dimensional configuration for simplicity .",
    "we first divide the space in which the atoms move in small enough cells ( of length @xmath125 ) so that double occupancy is extremely unlikely .",
    "each of these cells will constitute a site of an idealized lattice , which might or might not be filled with an atom . to highlight the importance of atomic motion , we show that in its absence the behavior of the system is strongly affected by finite - size effects .",
    "we further assume that the subdivision of the space is tuned in such a way that the facilitation shell produced by an excitation on the @xmath6-th site approximately covers only two cells at a distance @xmath126 away , i.e. , the two cells at positions @xmath127 . because of this , an excitation in @xmath6 can facilitate a nearby atom if either @xmath128 or @xmath129 is filled with an atom ( or both are ) .",
    "generalizing this picture , excitation clusters can only grow to extensive sizes if the lattice includes @xmath107-periodic sequences of filled sites .    in the following ,",
    "we show that the probability of occurrence of such sequences is exponentially suppressed in a static disordered system .",
    "to do so , we consider a chain of @xmath69 sites and @xmath70 atoms ( @xmath130 ) with lattice spacing @xmath131 .",
    "the setting is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2sm ] , where we show two chains of @xmath132 , with @xmath133 ( above ) and @xmath134 ( below ) atoms ( crosses correspond to empty sites , discs to filled sites ) . in the @xmath133 case",

    "one could thus naively expect that the number of configurations comprising at least a sublattice of period @xmath107 is @xmath150 where the binomials count the number of ways of filling the remaining l - b(b ) sites with n - b(b ) atoms . however , eq . ( [ marcuzzi1 ] )",
    "overcounts the number of configurations including at least one occupied sublattice , as it does not account for the possibility of having configurations that simultaneously include more than one  see fig .",
    "[ fig2sm ] where the @xmath140 configuration would be effectively counted twice . the following term , which accounts for the number of configurations in which two or more sublattices of period @xmath107 are present in the system , has to be subtracted in order to correct for this form of overcounting .",

    "for all the remaining terms @xmath179 we can apply stirling s formula to the numerator as well , finding @xmath180 where @xmath181 .",
    "this exponent can be given the following interpretation : by adding and subtracting a few terms , it can be recast as @xmath182 + \\left [ ( 1-\\rho ) \\log(1-\\rho ) + ( \\rho ) \\log(\\rho )   \\right ]   + \\\\       & - \\left [   ( nk^{-1 } ) \\log(nk^{-1 } ) + ( \\rho - nk^{-1 } ) \\log ( \\rho - nk^{-1 } ) + ( 1-\\rho ) \\log(1-\\rho )      \\right ] = \\\\      & -h(p ) - h(a ) + h(a , p ) = -i(a , p ) ,      \\label{eq : f_n } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath183 is the mutual information between the two random variables @xmath184 defined above and @xmath185 , corresponding to finding a site belonging to one of the considered periodic sequences by choosing one randomly .",
    "clearly , this is also a bernoulli trial with probabilities @xmath186 however , since by assumptions all of these periodic sites are filled with atoms , @xmath184 and @xmath185 are correlated ; in particular , @xmath187 which indeed proves that the mutual information between @xmath184 and @xmath185 is non - vanishing and corresponds to @xmath188 in eq .  .",
    "the mutual information increases with @xmath166 : indeed , the larger the number of periodic sequences considered , the higher the probability of being in one by picking a random _ filled _ site .",
    "the limiting case is the one discussed at the beginning , i.e. , @xmath170 , in which every filled site belongs to a periodic sequence and the outcome of @xmath184 completely determines the outcome of @xmath185 ( actually @xmath189 ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath190 is a negative and decreasing function of @xmath166 ( as one could also check by formally taking the derivative @xmath191 ) .",
    "the leading term is @xmath160  @xmath192 having been subtracted  while all the other ones are exponentially suppressed with respect to it and can be neglected as a first approximation .",
    "note that for the stirling approximation to hold for all the terms in the sum , and thereby for the leading role of the first term to emerge as pointed out above , we have to require @xmath193 .",
    "the validity of this approximation for reasonable parameter choices and lengths @xmath69 only a few times larger than @xmath107 is shown in fig .",

    "those that are related to the excitation dynamics ( namely , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath112 and @xmath22 ) can be taken as equal to the best estimates we have for the experimental values , as done also in the case of the mean - field model studied in the main text .",
    "other parameters ( related to structural features and to motion ) such as the length of the chain @xmath69 , the density @xmath162 and the hopping rate @xmath80 have to be inferred in a more indirect way .",
