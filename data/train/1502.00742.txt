    "a magnetic skyrmion , a nano - scale vortex - like spin texture in the real space , has attracted much attention in condensed matter physics.@xcite figure 1(a ) illustrates a magnetic skyrmion .",
    "magnetic moments point downward at the center of the skyrmion and upward along the periphery ; intermediate magnetic moments vary their directions continuously such that the moments wrap the whole solid angle at the center .",
    "the skyrmion s diameter is typically @xmath1 to @xmath2 nm and the magnetic skyrmion has been usually observed in a crystalline form ( the skyrmion crystal).@xcite since the skyrmion s spin configuration possesses the scalar spin chirality,@xcite topological phenomena appear in the hall effect,@xcite which is formulated by introducing an emergent electromagnetic field.@xcite besides its rich physics , the skyrmion has potential for applications especially in spintronics .",
    "unique properties of the skyrmion , i.e. , particle - like nanostructure and topological stability , are highly promising for novel spintronic devices such as information storage or logic devices.@xcite the skyrmion is also appealing as an efficient information carrier ; in fact , recent experiments showed that magnetic skyrmions can be moved by electric current at low energy costs.@xcite    in spite of the skyrmion s potential for spintronic applications , few studies have investigated skyrmions in terms of the pure spin current physics .",
    "a pure spin current refers to a flow of spin angular momentum with no charge currents ; its understanding and control are central issues of spintronics.@xcite if the pure spin current can be generated from magnetic skyrmions , the generation should be interesting for basic research and would be a step forward in skyrmionic devices as well . here , we experimentally demonstrate spin - current generation from a resonantly driven skyrmion motion in a helimagnetic insulator @xmath0 . using a @xmath0/pt two - layer structure ,",
    "we show that spin angular momentum transfers from the skyrmion crystal in @xmath0 to conduction electrons in pt via the spin pumping effect.@xcite the injected spin current is electrically detected in pt via the inverse spin hall effect ( ishe),@xcite which converts a spin current into a transverse electromotive force @xmath3 via large spin - orbit interaction of pt [ fig .",
    "@xmath3 is given by@xcite @xmath4 when a spin current carries the spin polarization @xmath5 in the spatial direction @xmath6 .",
    "we used @xmath0 for this work because the high - insulating property of @xmath0 enables electric detection of spin currents free from galvanomagnetic contamination.@xcite the skyrmion crystal in @xmath0 has been observed by lorentz transmission electron microscopy@xcite and neutron diffraction measurements.@xcite the helimagnetic ordering temperature is approximately @xmath7 k and a helical spin structure is stabilized by the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction at the zero magnetic field .",
    "the skyrmion - crystal phase appears in the vicinity of the ordering temperature in a restricted window of magnetic fields for bulk @xmath0 crystals.@xcite skyrmions form a two - dimensional triangular lattice within the plane perpendicular to an applied magnetic field.@xcite the magnetic phase diagram of @xmath0 is almost the same for any direction of an applied magnetic field.@xcite",
    "we grew single crystals of @xmath0 by a chemical vapor transport method.@xcite the volume of the crystals was typically @xmath8 mm@xmath9 .",
    "the magnetic moment @xmath10 for the prepared crystals was investigated with a vibrating sample magnetometer ( vsm ) in a physical properties measurement system ( quantum design , inc . ) . to make a @xmath0/pt sample , we polished the surface of @xmath0 and sputtered a @xmath11-nm - thick pt film on the polished surface in an argon atmosphere .",
    "figure 1(c ) illustrates an experimental set - up for detecting the spin pumping effect . to conduct microwave experiments",
    ", we used a reflection - type coplanar waveguide and a network analyzer . since the skyrmion phase is restricted in a narrow window of magnetic fields , we fixed a magnetic field and swept a microwave frequency to measure magnetic resonance .",
    "a static in - plane magnetic field was applied perpendicularly to a microwave magnetic field . when a microwave frequency fulfills resonance conditions of @xmath0 , magnetic moments are forced to precess ( magnetic resonance ) .",
    "if this precession transfers spin angular momentum to conduction electrons in pt , the spin current is converted into @xmath3 in pt via the ishe . to measure @xmath3 , we attached two electrodes to the ends of the pt film [ fig .",
    "applied microwaves were set at 10 mw .",
    "the used @xmath0 sample was of column shape and 1.5 mm across and 0.5 mm high .",
    "the spin - pumping measurement was performed in a cryogenic probe station , where the sample was cooled by attaching the bottom of a sample holder to a cold head .",
    "a system temperature was measured with a thermometer near the cold head ; the sample temperature appeared higher than the system temperature by about 5 k in the present study .",
    "the prepared @xmath0 single crystals were characterized by measuring @xmath10 .",
    "figure 2 shows temperature dependence of @xmath10 at 300 mt . with decreasing temperature",
    ", @xmath10 sharply increases at approximately 60 k and saturates at @xmath12 @xmath13 at 2 k. the ordering temperature and the saturation moment are consistent with those of preceding studies.@xcite the inset to fig .",
    "2 shows magnetic - field dependence of @xmath10 at 5 k. @xmath10 saturates above 100 mt , which suggests transition into a ferrimagnetic phase . in the magnetization curve below 100 mt , a step - like change appears near 30 mt .",
    "this change corresponds to a phase transition between multi - domain and single - domain helimagnetic states.@xcite hence , the magnetic properties of the prepared crystals are well consistent with the reported ones .",
    "figure 3 shows microwave responses of a @xmath0/pt sample at 45 k and 50 k. hereafter , temperatures refer to a system temperature @xmath14 of the probe station .",
    "figure 3(a ) shows frequency dependence of microwave absorption @xmath15 at 45 k , which is well lower than the helimagnetic ordering temperature . at 114 mt",
    ", @xmath15 shows a dip around 3.5 ghz .",
    "since the resonance frequency decreases with decreasing a magnetic field , the microwave absorption is attributed to a ferrimagnetic resonance of @xmath0 . below 54 mt ,",
    "two dips appear and their resonance frequencies increase with decreasing a magnetic field .",
    "the field dependence of the resonance frequencies is attributed to a helimagnetic phase induced by the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction.@xcite note that the two dips in the helimagnetic phase correspond to two spin - wave modes.@xcite figure 3(c ) summarizes field dependence of resonance frequencies at 45 k.    we observed magnetic resonances of the skyrmion crystal between 47 k and 51 k. figure 3(b ) shows frequency dependence of @xmath15 at 50 k. the resonance frequency decreases with decreasing a magnetic field from @xmath16 mt , and then increases below @xmath17 mt .",
    "this behavior is similar to that of @xmath18 k. from 30 mt through 6 mt , however , an additional excitation appears around 1.4 ghz while the excitation around 2 ghz is suppressed . below 3 mt",
    ", the additional dip disappears and the helimagnetic one revives around 2 ghz .",
    "figure 3(d ) summarizes field dependence of resonance frequencies at 50 k. while helimagnetic and ferrimagnetic modes appear both at 45 k and at 50 k , the new resonance mode appears at @xmath19 k only , as highlighted by the shading of fig .",
    "its resonance frequency is lower than those of the other modes and monotonically increases with increasing a magnetic field .",
    "this magnetic - field dependence obviously differs from that of helimagnetic modes .",
    "moreover , the new magnetic excitation occurs in a restricted window of magnetic fields .",
    "these results strongly indicate that magnetic excitations near 1.5 ghz originate from a collective motion of the skyrmion crystal . according to preceding studies on magnetic resonance of skyrmion crystals,@xcite",
    "the newly observed mode is attributed to a counterclockwise rotation of magnetic skyrmions , in which skyrmion s core rotates counterclockwise .",
    "note that the excitation observed around 2 ghz in the skyrmion - crystal phase is due to either a clockwise rotation of skyrmions@xcite or magnetic resonance of remnant helimagnetic states@xcite ; the origin of this excitation was unidentified in this experiment .",
    "accordingly , we confine ourselves to the counterclockwise skyrmion motion to investigate the spin pumping effect .",
    "figure 4(a ) shows a skyrmion phase diagram determined by magnetic resonance in the @xmath14 range slightly below the ordering temperature . here , critical magnetic fields @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are defined as shown in fig .",
    "3(d ) ; from @xmath20 through @xmath21 the skyrmion excitation continues while across @xmath22 a phase transition occurs from the helimagnetic state to the ferrimagnetic state . @xmath14 dependence of the critical magnetic fields reveals that magnetic excitations of the skyrmion crystal are restricted in a narrow window of @xmath14 ( approximately 4 k ) .",
    "this observation is consistent with a phase diagram determined by measurements of ac magnetic susceptibility,@xcite although error bars for @xmath20 and @xmath21 are rather large because of small skyrmion excitations around @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "note again that the skyrmion - crystal phase was observed at @xmath14 lower than those reported elsewhere@xcite because in the present set - up we could not attach the thermometer directly to the sample as mentioned in the method part .",
    "we demonstrate spin - current generation by measuring ishe - induced electromotive forces in pt at @xmath19 k. we first investigated the ferrimagnetic spin pumping at 66 mt [ point a in fig .",
    "4(a ) ] . figures 4(b ) and 4(c ) represent a microwave - absorption spectrum and an electromotive - force spectrum at point a , respectively . in the microwave - absorption spectrum [ fig .",
    "4(b ) ] , a single dip of ferrimagnetic resonance appears around 2 ghz .",
    "correlating with the resonance , a single dip of electromotive forces appear around the resonance frequency , as shown in fig .",
    "moreover , the electromotive forces show opposite polarity with an opposite magnetic field .",
    "this reversal is consistent with the ishe [ eq .",
    "( [ ishe ] ) ] and provides evidence for spin - current generation from the ferrimagnetic resonance .",
    "next , we conducted the spin - pumping measurement in the skyrmion - crystal phase [ point b in fig .",
    "a magnetic field was set at 15 mt to maximize microwave - absorption intensity within the skyrmion - crystal phase [ see also fig .",
    "3(b ) ] . figures 4(d ) and 4(e ) are a microwave - absorption spectrum and an electromotive - force spectrum at point b , respectively . in the microwave - absorption spectrum [ fig .",
    "4(d ) ] , two absorption dips appear ; the dip at the lower frequency ( @xmath231.3 ghz ) corresponds to the counterclockwise rotation of skyrmions [ see also figs .",
    "3(b ) and 3(d ) ] . in the electromotive - force spectrum",
    "4(e ) ] , electromotive forces appear around 1.3 ghz in correlation with the skyrmion excitation . again",
    ", the electromotive forces show opposite polarity with an opposite magnetic field .",
    "moreover , the electromotive force is of the same sign for skyrmion and ferrimagnetic phases for a given field direction . the results are consistent with eq .",
    "( [ ishe ] ) because the direction of spin polarization should be determined by a static magnetic field also in the skyrmion - crystal phase .",
    "these observations show that the resonantly excited skyrmion motion can give rise to the spin pumping effect and that the skyrmion dynamics can be detected electrically via the ishe . dividing the voltage by the intensity of microwave absorption@xcite yields 16 @xmath24 for the ferrimagnetic phase and 8 @xmath24 for the skyrmion - crystal phase , which implies the lower efficiency of the spin pumping in the skyrmion - crystal phase .",
    "we numerically calculated spin currents related with skyrmion dynamics to demonstrate theoretically that the counterclockwise skyrmion motion can contribute to the spin pumping effect .",
    "the dynamics of local magnetizations @xmath25 were simulated with the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation@xcite for a single skyrmion on a two - dimensional square lattice in the @xmath26-@xmath27 plane .",
    "the used hamiltonian is @xmath28 where @xmath29 mev and @xmath30 are coupling constants of ferromagnetic interaction and dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction , respectively , and @xmath31 is a static magnetic field in the @xmath32 direction , i.e. , perpendicular to the square lattice .",
    "the system size was @xmath33 sites .",
    "the parameters used for the llg equation were : the gyromagnetic ratio @xmath34 hz / t ; the gilbert damping constant @xmath35 ; a static magnetic field @xmath36 mt in the @xmath32 direction ; a microwave magnetic field @xmath37 mt in the @xmath27 direction ; the microwave frequency @xmath38 ghz . with these parameters ,",
    "the skyrmion s core resonantly rotates counterclockwise as shown in figs .",
    "5(a)-(d ) .",
    "note that values of the static magnetic field and the resonance frequency are not equal to those of our measurement because the simplest model of a single skyrmion was adopted to capture the essence of the spin pumping from the skyrmion dynamics .    generated spin currents were calculated using the time average of @xmath39@xcite at the bottom edge of the system @xmath40 , namely @xmath41 , where @xmath42 represents the time average of @xmath43 .",
    "as shown in figs .",
    "5(e)-(h ) , both the magnitude and the sign of @xmath43 depend heavily on space and time .",
    "the spatial dependence reflects a swirling spin structure due to the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction ; such behavior has not been observed for centrosymmetric systems such as @xmath44 , where the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction is absent .",
    "the spatial and temporal dependence of @xmath43 at the edge gives rise to the complicated time evolution of generated spin currents @xmath45 as indicated by a blue dashed line in fig .",
    "5(i ) . the temporal dependence of @xmath45 can not be described by a single sine wave , which implies that nonlinear magnetization dynamics were also driven for @xmath46 mt .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath47 is found to be finite as highlighted by the shading in fig .",
    "5(i ) , which theoretically substantiates our experimental results . as illustrated in figs .",
    "5(a)-(d ) , magnetic moments even at the edge form a noncollinear configuration owing to the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction .",
    "although a similar noncollinear configuration at the edge was found also for the ferrimagnetic phase in the calculation with @xmath48 t , the temporal dependence of @xmath45 for @xmath46 mt was simply sinusoidal .",
    "we note that @xmath47 for the skyrmion phase was approximately 30 % smaller than for the ferrimagnetic phase in the present calculation .",
    "this result indicates the lower efficiency of the spin pumping in the skyrmion phase , which is consistent with our experimental result .",
    "the numerical calculation presented here demonstrates that non - uniform spin configurations such as skyrmions can give rise to the spin pumping effect while the observation of the spin pumping has been confined to uniform spin configurations such as ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic states so far .",
    "to summarize , we have observed spin - current generation from skyrmion dynamics in a @xmath0/pt two - layer structure .",
    "we resonantly excited magnetic skyrmions in @xmath0 by a microwave and electrically detected spin currents via the ishe in pt .",
    "a numerical calculation showed that a rotational motion of skyrmions can give rise to a finite dc spin current via the spin pumping effect .",
