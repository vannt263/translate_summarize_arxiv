    "drift wave turbulence @xcite is composed of coupled nonlinear fluctuations of pressure @xmath0 and the electrostatic potential @xmath1 in an inhomogeneous plasma with a guiding magnetic field @xmath2 . the local electrostatic potential acts as a stream function for the dominant plasma flow with the drift velocity .",
    "the plasma is advected around the isocontours of a potential perturbation perpendicular to the magnetic field and forms a quasi two - dimensional vortex : an initial localized plasma density perturbation rapidly loses electrons along the magnetic field @xmath2 , leaving a positive electrostatic potential perturbation @xmath1 in its place .",
    "the associated electric field @xmath3 is directed outward from the perturbation centre , and in combination with a magnetic field @xmath2 causes an `` e - cross - b '' vortex drift motion of the whole plasma along isocontours of the potential with a velocity @xmath4 .",
    "this gyration averaged drift motion is a result of the combined electric and magnetic forces acting on a charged particle with small gyration radius compared to background scales @xcite . in the presence of a background density ( or pressure ) gradient @xmath5 the vortex propagates in the direction perpendicular to both @xmath5 and @xmath2 .",
    "drift waves become unstable if the electron density can not rapidly adapt to the electrostatic potential along the direction parallel to @xmath2 , which can be caused by interaction of the electrons with other particles or waves .",
    "nonlinear coupling of drift waves results in a self - sustained fully developed turbulent state @xcite .",
    "the requirements for the occurrence of drift waves are ubiquitously met in inhomogeneous magnetized plasmas when the drift scale @xmath6 is much smaller than the background pressure gradient length @xmath7 , or equivalently , when the fluctuation frequency @xmath8 is much smaller than the ion gyration frequency @xmath9 . here",

    "the aggregation of charged particles is in addition influenced by static and dynamic electric and magnetic fields . for gyrofluid drift wave turbulence in inhomogeneous magnetized plasmas",
    "it has been observed by scott  @xcite that the gyrocenter density of light positive trace ions ( in addition to electrons and a main ion species ) in three - species fusion plasma drift wave turbulence tend to dynamically align with the fluctuating electron density , so that fluctuation amplitudes of the electron and trace ion densities are spatiotemporally closely correlated .",
    "priego et al .",
    "@xcite have found that the particle density of inertial impurties in a fluid drift wave turbulence model is also closely correlated with the exb flow vorticity .",
    "the present analysis shows that the dynamical alignment in drift wave turbulence is not only sign selective with respect to the vorticity of trapping eddies , for any given trace species charge and background magnetic field direction , but also their large - scale background gradient .",
    "the resulting asymmetric effects on transport and aggregation of charged particles is specifically discussed for application to space plasmas , in particular for cases of a nearly collisionless plasma with cold ions and low parallel electron resistivity , where the electrostatic potential closely follows changes in the electron density .",
    "it is shown that in this case drift wave turbulence constitutes a unique mechanism for truly chiral vortical aggregation of charged molecules in space environments with a background magnetic field and plasma density gradients .",

    "are considered , and the parameter @xmath41 is going to be fixed , while other parameters are being varied .    the 2d isothermal gyrofluid model and its relation to ( inertial ) fluid models is briefly discussed in the appendix .",

    "the anomalous diffusion , clustering and pinch of impurities in plasma edge turbulence has also been studied previously by priego et al .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    "the impurities were modeled as a passive fluid advected by the electric and polarization drifts , while the ambient plasma turbulence was modeled using the 2d hasegawa - wakatani model . as a consequence of compressibility",
    "it has there also been found that the density of inertial impurities correlates with the vorticity of the exb velocity .",
    "trace impurities were observed to cluster in vortices of a precise orientation determined by the charge of the impurity particles @xcite .",
    "the major difference to the present approach is that priego et al . have considered only a constant impurity background ( i.e. no impurity background gradient ) , but have in addition included additional nonlinear inertial effects through the impurity polarization drift .",
    "linear inertial effects by polarization are already consistently included in the local gyrofluid model . the detailed correspondence between the two models is discussed in the appendix .    for an initial homogeneous distribution of impurities with no background gradient ( @xmath44 ) and vanishing ( or constant ) initial perturbation @xmath45",

    "while , as usual in a fully developed turbulent state , vortices of both signs appear equally likely and evenly distributed over all turbulent scales , the trace particle aggregation on drift scales emerges with one prefered rotationality with respect to the background magnetic field and background particle gradients .",
    "finally , a possible relevance of the asymmetric alignment effect on molecular chemistry in a magnetized space plasma environment is suggested .",
    "homochirality of biomolecules  the fact that the essential chemical building blocks of life have a certain handedness while synthetic production leads to equal ( racemic ) distribution of left - handed and right - handed chiral structures  has ever since its discovery by pasteur @xcite posed a formidable puzzle @xcite .",
    "pasteur already had unsuccessfully tried to identify physical causes for this biological symmetry breaking , for example by imposing chirality through fluid vortices in a centrifuge , and by exposing chemical solutions to a magnetic field @xcite .    a number of theories and experiments on the origin of chirality have since been put forward , like effects of circularly polarized light on the molecular reactions @xcite or a combination of magnetic field and non - polarized light @xcite , or possible electroweak effects on quantum chemistry @xcite .",
    "all of these mechanisms could be active in interplanetary and interstellar space , and would hint on an extraterrestrial origin of early fundamental biomolecules .",
    "that chirality can in principle indeed be imposed by rotational forces has been confirmed experimentally for different situations @xcite , but what mechanism could invoke a specific directionality in turbulent ( terrestrial or space ) fluids or plasmas , where vortices of both senses of rotation generically occur mixed across all scales , has been left an open question . here",
    "we argue that rotation asymmetric ion aggregation in drift vortices in magnetized space plasmas constitutes a mechanism for fostering a truly chiral environment for enantiomeric selective extraterrestrial formation of biomolecules .    the drift scaling conditions and possibilities for occurrence of drift wave turbulence are well fulfilled for a number of typical space plasma parameters and magnetic field strengths , like in ( warm ionized ) clouds in the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "the background pressure or density gradient length of molecular ion species in the interstellar medium can take values across many orders of magnitude .",
    "while interstellar clouds range in size between a few and hundreds of parsecs ( 1 pc = @xmath101  m ) and thus have global gradient lengths of the same order , the local gradients can be set by macroscopic turbulence ( resulting from large scale magnetohydrodynamic motion or by chaotic external drive through winds and jets ) and vary widely , from observable scales of 100 pc down to 1000 km @xcite .",
    "then again , the gradient of molecular ion density can also be set by a spatially varying degree of ionization , for example through inhomogeneous irradiation at the edge of molecular clouds .",
    "magnetic field strengths in the interstellar medium can occur up to a few @xmath102 g to mg , and temperatures range between 10 k in cold molecular clouds to 10000 k in warm ionized interstellar medium . the resulting drift ( and vortex ) scale @xmath15 is in the order between a few hundred meters and a few hundred kilometers .",
    "typical vortex life times are in the order between seconds and hours . the mean free path ( parallel to a magnetic field ) between particle collisions is in the order of 1000 km , so that the plasma is only weakly collisional .",
    "the drift ratio is in the maximum order of @xmath103 and smaller , thus well below unity .",
    "the relative fluctuation amplitudes ( compared to background values of the plasma density ) in drift wave turbulence are typically in the order of the drift ratio and thus here in the range of a few percent or below . compared to macroscopic flow - driven or magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence ,",
    "drift wave turbulence is most effective on smaller scales , in the order of @xmath15 , and with relatively small amplitude .",
    "drift wave vortices in the size between a few hundred meters and hundreds of kilometers are thus expected to be present in most interstellar plasmas .",
    "next we consider , if such vortices truly can account for a chiral physical effect .",
    "chiral synthesis usually requires a truly chiral influence @xcite : the parity transformation @xmath104 has to result in a mirror asymmetric state that needs to be different from simply a time reversal @xmath105 plus a subsequent rotation by @xmath106 .",
    "a purely 2d vortex can not exert a truly chiral influence , while 3d funnel - like fluid vortices in principle do .",
    "while a bulk rotation per se can not cause any direct polarizing effect on the reaction path for molecular synthesis @xcite , particle aggregation on a supramolecular level in vortex motion has been experimentally shown to be able to lead to chiral selection @xcite .",
    "to date it however remains unclear how chirality from a supramolecular aggregate ( clusters or dust ) could be transfered to single molecules @xcite .    in the case of drift wave turbulence",
    "the parallel wave - like dynamics imposes a wave vector @xmath22 that under @xmath107 changes direction with respect to the vorticity @xmath108 and @xmath2 ( which themselves are pseudovectors and remain invariant under @xmath107 ) , equivalently to a 3d vortex tube .",
    "drift wave turbulence is thus truly chiral , although it characteristically appears quasi - two - dimensional . in case of a large - scale density gradient @xmath109 along @xmath2",
    "the ( small ) @xmath22 is given by this gradient length , otherwise it is determined by local fluctuations .",
    "molecular ions are advected by the drift vortex motion , and are subjected to chiral aggregation onto neutral molecules , clusters or dust particles that are not participating in the plasma rotation .",
    "if in addition ( as to be rather expected in most cases ) a trace ion background density gradient in the direction parallel to @xmath2 is present , the resulting parallel wave vector @xmath22 prescribes in combination with vorticity @xmath108 a definite true chiral vortex effect .",
    "chemical reactions in this system occur by collisions or aggregation of ions , that participate in the chiral vortex rotation , with neutral molecules or clusters of the quiescent ( non rotating ) background gas .",
    "the co- or counter alignment of @xmath2 with @xmath108 can further act as chiral catalyst .",
    "the chiral influence however changes sign in different sides or regions of the ( large - scale ) molecular cloud , when the relative direction of background particle gradient and magnetic field direction reverses .",
    "this implies that different regions of the interstellar medium favour different tendencies for chiral selective aggregation , and thus for a potential enantiomeric excess in molecular syntheses .",
    "the excess rate could be expected in the order of the relative density fluctuations in drift wave turbulence , of a few percent .",
    "a possible problem that could not be addressed with the present electrostatic model is whether chiral alignment may be broken by strong alfvnic activity .",
    "electromagnetic computations for moderate beta values ( a few percent as for fusion edge plasmas ) in ref .",
    "@xcite for absolute correlation have however shown no significant deviation of the alignment character compared to electrostatic computations , so that chiral alignment may be expected to survive for finite beta .",
    "chiral aggregation in drift vortices should therefore be feasible locally at least in lower beta regions of the interstellar or interplanetary media .",
    "the necessary conditions for chiral aggregation thus appear rather restrictive and cosmologically rare .",
    "it may be concluded that either the suggested mechanism for chiral synthesis is subdominant ( compared to any other of proposed or yet unknown mechanisms ) , or that a chiral excess of molecules should cosmologically be a rather rare phenomenon itself .",
