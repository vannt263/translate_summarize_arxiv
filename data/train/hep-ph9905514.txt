    "data are becoming available for processes which are described by off - diagonal ( or skewed ) parton distributions .",
    "a relevant example is diffractive vector meson production at hera , @xmath2 with @xmath3 or @xmath4 , where at high @xmath5 c.m .",
    "energy , @xmath6 , the cross section is dominated by the two - gluon exchange diagram @xmath7 ^ 2    \\label{eq:1}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the off - diagonal ( @xmath9 ) gluon distribution with @xmath10 see ref .",
    "@xmath11 is the mass of the @xmath12 system produced by a photon of virtuality @xmath13 .",
    "the relevant scale is @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 specify the momenta of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the quadratic dependence on @xmath8 in ( [ eq:1 ] ) shows that these data may offer a sensitive constraint on the gluon .",
    "indeed our aim is to show that the off - diagonal distributions are fixed by the conventional diagonal partons , so that the data can , in principle , be included in a global parton analysis .",
    "we shall use the off - forward  distributions @xmath19 with support @xmath20 introduced by ji @xcite , with the minor difference that the gluon @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "they depend on the momentum fractions @xmath22 carried by the emitted and absorbed partons at each scale @xmath23 and on the momentum transfer variable @xmath24 . the variables @xmath25 and @xmath1 do not change as we evolve the distributions up in the scale @xmath23 . in the limit @xmath26",
    "they reduce to the conventional parton distributions @xmath27 and satisfy dglap evolution . in the limit @xmath28 they obey erbl evolution .",
    "if we consider @xmath29 at arbitrary values of @xmath1 , then for @xmath30 and @xmath31 we have dglap - like evolution for quarks and antiquarks respectively , while for @xmath32 we have erbl - like evolution for the emitted @xmath12 pair .",
    "on account of the @xmath33 symmetry the distributions @xmath34 are symmetric in @xmath1 .",
    "we also have symmetry relations in terms of the @xmath0 variable @xmath35 where the superscripts @xmath36 and @xmath37 denote singlet and non - singlet quarks respectively .",
    "the conformal moments , and in @xcite for @xmath39 ; see also @xcite . ] of the off - diagonal distributions , @xmath40 are not mixed by evolution @xmath41 where @xmath42 are the same anomalous dimensions as for diagonal partons . the @xmath43",
    "are known polynomials of degree @xmath44 @xmath45 with @xmath46 for quarks and gluons respectively .",
    "the @xmath47 reduce to the usual moments in the limit @xmath26 .",
    "for example for quarks @xmath48 up to a normalizing factor @xmath49 .",
    "the crucial step is to find the inverse relation to ( [ eq:4 ] ) .",
    "that is to reconstruct @xmath50 from a knowledge of the conformal moments .",
    "the result , due to shuvaev @xcite , is @xmath51 where the kernel @xmath52 is a known integral @xcite and @xmath53 is the mellin transform @xmath54 @xmath53 reduces to the diagonal distribution for @xmath55 .",
    "this follows since @xcite @xmath56 } o_{nk } \\xi^{2k } \\nonumber     \\\\    & \\simeq & o_{n0 } \\ ; = \\ ; o_n ( 0 ) = m_n r_n ( 1 , 1 )    \\label{eq:10 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for small @xmath57 .",
    "so the off - diagonal distribution @xmath58 is completely determined in terms of the diagonal distribution @xmath53 via ( [ eq:8 ] ) .",
    "we can simplify ( [ eq:8 ] ) further if we assume that the diagonal partons have the form @xmath60 for very small @xmath0 .",
    "then the @xmath61 integration can be performed analytically and @xmath62 with @xmath63 for @xmath64 respectively .",
    "a full set of results for the off - diagonal / diagonal ratios , @xmath65 can be found in @xcite .",
    "there , the ratios @xmath66 and @xmath67 are plotted as functions of @xmath68 for different values of @xmath69 . the scale dependence of the off - diagonal distributions , @xmath70 of ( [ eq:11a ] ) , and hence of the @xmath71 , is hidden in the @xmath23 dependence of the @xmath69 .",
    "both @xmath72 and @xmath73 increase with increasing @xmath23 .",
    "the value of the ratio for the gluon distribution at @xmath74 is relevant for diffractive vector meson production , @xmath2 , at high energies , see ( [ eq:1a ] ) .",
    "this ratio is given by @xmath75 the cross section formula ( [ eq:1 ] ) may then be expressed in terms of the conventional diagonal gluon distribution @xmath8 , @xmath76 ^ 2 ,    \\label{eq:13}\\ ] ] where all the off - diagonal effects are contained in the known ( enhancement ) factor @xmath77 . of course to calculate the cross section properly we must use the unintegrated gluon distribution and integrate over the transverse momenta of the exchanged gluons and of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 forming the vector meson .    to obtain the scale dependence of @xmath67 , we first obtain the @xmath23 dependence of @xmath72 of ( [ eq:11 ] ) from the behaviour of the gluon found in the global parton analyses .",
    "for example , the mrst partons @xcite have @xmath78 and 0.38 at @xmath79 and 100  gev@xmath80 respectively . the appropriate scale for the diffractive process @xmath81",
    "is @xmath82 . in this way , for diffractive @xmath83 and @xmath4 photoproduction at hera we find that the off - diagonal enhancement , @xmath77 , is @xmath84 and @xmath85 respectively . however , for @xmath4 photoproduction , @xmath0 is not sufficiently small @xmath86 and we have to improve the assumption made in ( [ eq:11 ] ) .",
    "if we take @xmath87 and perform the @xmath61 integration in ( [ eq:8 ] ) numerically , then we find an enhancement of @xmath88 for @xmath4 photoproduction @xcite .",
    "moreover for @xmath89 electroproduction it is found @xcite that the enhancement due to off - diagonal effects of the @xmath90 cross section @xmath91 , at the largest @xmath13 of the hera data , is more than a factor 2 , which is just the enhancement needed to ensure a perturbative qcd description of the data .",
    "the main conclusion is embodied in eqs .",
    "( [ eq:8])([eq:10 ] ) . that is the skewed distribution @xmath38 , at any scale ,",
    "is fully determined at small @xmath59 by knowledge of the diagonal parton distribution , at the same scale .    to be sure of this result",
    "we have checked that the analytic continuation of the conformal moments @xmath47 in @xmath44 is allowed @xcite .",
    "a second consideration is that , from a formal point of view , we may add to the off - diagonal distribution any function which exists only in the erbl - like region , @xmath92 . in @xcite",
    "we show such a contribution is negligible @xmath93 at small @xmath1 .",
    "so far our distributions allow the calculation of the imaginary part of the amplitude for the process . at small @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    "it turns out that the real part may be calculated easily using a dispersion relation in the c.m .",
    "energy squared , @xmath94 , and that the amplitude @xmath95 where @xmath96 .",
    "finally we note that our result remains valid at nlo , since there is no conformal mixing for @xmath55 .",
    "we conclude that , at small @xmath59 , the skewed distributions @xmath97 are completely known in terms of conventional partons .",
    "thus data for processes which are described by such distributions can , in principle , be included in a conventional global analysis to better constrain the low @xmath0 behaviour of the partons .",
