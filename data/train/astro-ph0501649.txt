    "a large variety of molecules , including complex organic ones , have been detected in the galactic interstellar medium .",
    "the hydroxyl ( oh ) radical is quite abundant in the galactic plane and has several rotational transitions that are easily observed at microwave frequencies .",
    "these lines are found to originate from thermal processes as well as non - thermal processes ( i.e. maser emission ) .",
    "thermal emission from oh radical was first detected in 1963 ( weinreb et al . 1963 ) .",
    "the thermal lines are observed from extended regions in the galactic plane . on the other hand , maser emission from oh radical",
    "is associated with specific activities in the galaxy .",
    "for instance , oh masers from the ground state rotational transitions with frequencies 1665 and 1667 mhz are mostly associated with star - forming regions , 1612 mhz masers are associated with evolved stars ( elitzur 1992 ; reid & moran 1981 ) and the 1720 mhz masers are associated with shocked regions at the boundaries where supernova remnants interact with molecular clouds ( wardle & yusuf - zadeh 2002 ) . modeling the line emission provides an understanding of the physical conditions and processes that occur in the galactic interstellar medium where oh lines originate . despite the large amount of observational data available and considerable theoretical effort , a clear understanding of the pumping mechanisms that lead to different inversions in oh masers is lacking ( elitzur 1976 , cesaroni & walmsley 1990 ) .",
    "in addition to the microwave lines , the oh radical also has transitions in the meter - wave .",
    "these lines are produced due to transitions between hyperfine levels in the same @xmath3 doublet states ( see section  [ sec : ohline ] ) .",
    "the frequencies of these transitions in the ground rotational state are 53 and 55 mhz .",
    "these lines , which have not been observed so far , are expected to have weak line intensities because they are magnetic dipole transitions .",
    "moreover , observations are further complicated due to excessive man - made radio frequency interference ( rfi ) near the line frequencies .",
    "it is owing to severe rfi at this frequency , along with the weak nature of these lines , that attempts to detect these lines were not made earlier ( turner , b. e. personal communication ) . as discussed above , in a variety of astrophysical situations ,",
    "maser emission is observed from the microwave transitions .",
    "therefore , the possibility of maser emission of meter - wave transitions can not be ruled out and may be strong enough to be detected .",
    "the detection of these lines could provide clues to resolve , for example , the pumping mechanism of oh masers observed at microwave frequencies .    in this paper",
    ", we present an attempt to detect the 53 mhz oh line by observing with the national mst radar facility ( nmrf ) at gadanki , india , in the receiving mode of the antenna . a brief discussion of the 53 mhz oh line emission is given in section  [ sec : ohline ] .",
    "we describe the observing setup and strategy in section  [ sec : obs ] and discuss the data analysis in section  [ sec : dat ] .",
    "results of the oh line observations are presented in section  [ sec : res ] .",
    "in addition to the oh line , carbon recombination lines ( rls ) were also present within the observing band .",
    "the results of the rl observations are also included in section  [ sec : res ] .",
    "our conclusion and prospects for future observations are given in section  [ sec : con ] .",
    "the energy diagram for the ground state rotational transitions of the oh molecule is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : eng ] .",
    "the rotational ladder of oh is split into @xmath4 and @xmath5 ladders because of the spin - orbit coupling of a single unpaired electron in a 2p orbital on the o atom .",
    "here we consider the ground rotational state , characterized by @xmath6 .",
    "this state is split into two levels as a result of the small difference in moment of inertia when the electron orbital is parallel or perpendicular to the molecule s rotation axis ( @xmath3 doubling ) and further split by the hyperfine interaction between the electron spin and the spin of the proton in the h atom .",
    "the microwave lines of oh at frequencies 1612 , 1665 , 1667 and 1720 mhz arise from transitions between these four @xmath3 doubling states , i.e. , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , where + and @xmath0 indicate the higher and lower @xmath3 doublet states .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : eng ] ) .",
    "the two magnetic dipole transitions from quantum states @xmath8 and @xmath9 have frequencies near 55 and 53 mhz respectively .",
    "we estimate the thermal line intensity from a cloud with oh column density in the range 10@xmath10 to 10@xmath11 @xmath12 and a typical kinetic temperature of 100 k ( weinreb et al .",
    "1963 , elitzur 1976 , lockett et al .",
    "the line optical depth is estimated using the einstein a coefficient for the 53 mhz transition of @xmath13 10@xmath14 s@xmath15 , the rotational constant of 18.51 cm@xmath15 and considering a typical oh line width of 5 km s@xmath15 ( weaver 1963 , destombes et al .",
    "1977 , turner 1979 ) .",
    "a mean galactic background temperature of 25000 k at 53 mhz is used for the calculation .",
    "this background temperature is obtained by scaling the measured temperature at 34.5 mhz using a spectral index of @xmath02.7 ( dwarakanath & udaya shankar 1990 , salter & brown 1988 ) the expected line brightness temperature is 10@xmath17 and 1 k for column densities 10@xmath10 and 10@xmath11 @xmath12 respectively . due to the high galactic background near 53 mhz ( which dominates the system temperature )",
    "it is not possible to detect the thermal oh line in a reasonable observing time .",
    "however , there exists a possibility of maser emission of the meter - wave transitions ( turner , b. e. personal communication ) . to our knowledge",
    ", there have been no attempts to calculate the line strengths of these maser lines .",
    "we decided to search for 53 mhz maser emission towards direction where oh microwave masers ( as well as thermal lines ) were detected earlier .",
    "the observations presented in this paper are made with the national mst radar facility located at gadanki in andhra pradesh , india ( 13@xmath18@xmath19 @xmath20 , 79@xmath18@xmath21 @xmath22 ) . in this section ,",

    "the array is spread out over an area of 130 m x 130 m and has an effective aperture of @xmath23 m@xmath24 .",
    "the antenna and receiver system are tuned to operate at a center frequency of 53 mhz with a bandwidth of @xmath13 2 mhz .",
    "the two crossed yagi elements , corresponding to the two orthogonal linear polarizations , are oriented along the east - west ( e - w ) and north - south ( n - s ) directions .",
    "the signals from the elements are combined to form beams that can be pointed in steps of 1@xmath18  to a maximum of 20@xmath18  from the zenith along e - w and n - s directions .",
    "the e - w beams are formed in the following way .",
    "the signals of 32 n - s yagi elements , which form a linear sub - array , are combined using passive directional couplers .",
    "such a sub - array is also called a module .",
    "the output of 32 such modules are amplified using low - noise amplifiers and down converted to 5 mhz intermediate frequency ( if ) using a local oscillator ( lo ) of frequency 48 mhz .",
    "these if outputs are combined with appropriate phase gradients to form the e - w beams .",
    "the phase - shifters are placed in the lo path as shown in fig .",

    "the bandwidth of the second if is restricted to @xmath131.3 mhz using a bandpass filter centred at 10.7 mhz .",
    "the if signal is bandpass sampled at 3.3 mhz and converted to 2-bit , 4-level data .",
    "a bit - packing logic then packs consecutive samples into 16-bit words .",
    "this data is acquired and stored using a personal computer .",
    "a marker is also inserted after 4096 data words to identify any loss of samples while analysing data .",
    "the ppr has another synthesizer which we used to generate the first local oscillator signal ( see below ) .",
    "both the synthesizers are locked to a rubidium oscillator .",
    "the existing data acquisition software for the ppr was modified to incorporate a dual - dicke frequency switching scheme for bandpass calibration .",
    "we switched the first local oscillator ( lo1 ) between 47.8948 mhz and 48.0 mhz .",
    "the values of the frequencies were selected so that the 53 mhz line of oh and five rl of carbon be within the @xmath131.3 mhz bandwidth used for observations . the difference between the two frequencies",
    "was chosen based on the expected line width of the rl .",
    "the modified data acquisition software sets the first local oscillator frequency and acquires 640 kbytes of data corresponding to each frequency setting after allowing for settling time of a few msec .",
    "this amount of data will be acquired in about a sec .",
    "thus the frequency switching takes place at 1 sec rate .",
    "the candidate sources towards which the 53 mhz oh line emission is expected are mostly in the galactic plane .",
    "the long integration required for our observations can be obtained if the antenna could track the celestial source .",
    "however , the mst radar facility in its current configuration does not permit tracking of celestial sources .",
    "we adopted a strategy of observing a position in the galactic plane with the different east - west beams of the antenna , thus effectively tracking the position for about 40@xmath18(see section  [ sec : obs : mst ] ) .",
