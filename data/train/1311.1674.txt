    "[ fig : holeclumpevolution](a ) shows that the second burst occurs before the remnant hole - clump pair from the first burst is completely dissipated .",

    "the growth is not linear in the case of quasi - periodic chirping bursts .",
    "for the same reason , successive chirping rates may not reflect the relaxed distribution ( @xmath14 in the collision operator @xmath56 ) , but the instantaneous state of the relaxing distribution ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "in addition , since the discrepancy @xmath57 depends on the details of the velocity distribution , theory predicts the timing of the subsequent burst ( e.g. at @xmath58 ) , but only qualitatively .",
    "instability dynamics @xcite is of great interest in the context of pattern formation @xcite , the onset of turbulence @xcite , and many other subjects . while instabilities are central to virtually every field of physics , in collisionless or weakly collisional plasmas the disparate roles of resonant and non - resonant particles offers an interesting variation on time - honored methods and approaches . in this respect",
    ", it has long been realized that wave and instability dynamics and evolution in a collisionless plasma can be described in terms of coupled , inter - penetrating ensembles of resonant and non - resonant particles or equivalently , resonant particles and a gas of plasmon quasi - particles .",
