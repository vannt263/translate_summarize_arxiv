    "in 2005 , nualart and peccati @xcite , discovered the remarkable fact that a sequence of multiple wiener - it integrals , that is , members of a wiener chaos , converges in distribution to a gaussian random variable if and only if their second and fourth moments converge to the corresponding moments of the limiting random variable .",
    "the proof in @xcite relies on a theorem in stochastic calculus , namely the dubins - schwarz theorem .",
    "although the proof is elegant , it does not provide good bounds on the distances ( for instance , the kolmogorov distance ) between the sequence and its limit .",
    "a few years later , the result of nualart and peccati @xcite was generalized and developed further by peccati and tudor @xcite and also by nourdin and peccati @xcite .",
    "peccati and tudor @xcite considered the multivariate central limit theorem for vectors of multiple wiener - it integrals and established that if the covariance matrices of the vectors of multiple wiener - it integrals converge to that of a gaussian vector , then joint convergence in distribution to gaussian is equivalent to coordinate - wise convergence in distribution to gaussian .",
    "as an application of this result , the central limit theorem for any sequence of random variables can be established by proving a central limit theorem for each term in the chaos expansion .    another significant development from the work of nualart and peccati @xcite is that of nourdin and peccati @xcite .",
    "developing considerably a remarkable intuition of nualart and ortiz - latorre in @xcite , nourdin and peccati @xcite established a fundamental connection between stein s method and the malliavin calculus via the use of the malliavin operators ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "this connection resulted in the derivation of errors bounds , often optimal , in the central limit theorems for random variables in the wiener space .",
    "of special interest in this paper is the proof of error bounds in the central limit theorem for multiple wiener - it integrals , which we call the fourth moment theorem .",
    "the success of such a connection relies on the fact that both stein s method and the malliavin calculus are built on some integration by parts techniques .",
    "in addition , the operators of the malliavin calculus , @xmath3 , satisfy several nice integration by parts formulae which fit in perfectly with the so - called stein equation . for a good overview of these techniques , we refer to the following website .      the work of nourdin and peccati @xcite has added a new dimension to stein s method .",
    "their approach of combining stein s method with the malliavin calculus has led to improvements and refinements of many results in probability theory , such as the breuer - major theorem @xcite .",
    "more recently , this approach has been successfully used to obtain central limit theorems in stochastic geometry , stochastic calculus , statistical physics , and for zeros of random polynomials .",
    "it has also been    extended to different settings as in non - commutative probability and poisson chaos .",
    "of particular interest is the connection between the nourdin - peccati analysis and information theory , which was recently revealed in @xcite .",
    "an overview of these new developments can also be found in the above website .",
    "the approach of nourdin and peccati @xcite entails the use of the so - called product formula for wiener integrals .",
    "the use of this formula makes the proofs rather involved since it relies on subtle combinatorial arguments . very recently ,",
    "starting with the work of ledoux @xcite , a new approach to the fourth moment theorem was developed by azmoodeh , campese and poly @xcite by combining stein s method with the dirichlet form calculus .",
    "an advantage of this new approach is that it provides a simpler proof of the theorem by avoiding completely the use of the product formula .",
    "moreover , since a dirichlet space is a more general concept than the wiener space , the former contains examples of fourth moment theorems that can not be realized on the latter .",
    "a more algebraic flavor of this approach has enabled azmoodeh , malicet and poly @xcite to prove that convergence of pairs of moments other than the 2nd and 4th ( for example , the 6th and 68th ) also implies the central limit theorem .",
    "this new approach seems to open up new possibilities and perhaps also central limit theorems on manifolds .",
    "this paper is an exposition on the connections between stein s method and the malliavin calculus and between stein s method and dirichlet forms , and on how these connections are exploited in proving the fourth moment theorem .",
    "stein s method began with charles stein using his own approach in the 1960 s to prove the combinatorial central limit theorems of wald and wolfowitz @xcite and of hoeffding @xcite .",
    "motivated by permutation tests in nonparametric statistics , wald and wolfowitz @xcite proved that under certain conditions , @xmath4 converges in distribution to the standard normal distribution @xmath5 , where @xmath6 are real numbers and @xmath7 a random permutation of @xmath8 .",
    "hoeffding @xcite generalized the result of wald and wolfowitz @xcite to @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a square array of real numbers and @xmath7 a random permutation of @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath11 and let @xmath12 be the characteristic function of @xmath13 .",
    "assume @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( which implies @xmath17=0 $ ] ) , and also assume @xmath18 . while using exchangeable pairs to show that      stein realized that there was nothing special about the complex exponentials .",

    "there is no inversion of the characteristic function .",
    "stein s method for normal approximation was published in his seminal 1972 paper in the proceedings of the sixth berkeley symposium .",
    "although the method was developed for normal approximation , stein s ideas were very general and the method was modified by chen @xcite for poisson approximation . since then the method has been constantly developed and applied to many approximations beyond normal and poisson and in finite as well as infinite dimensional spaces . as stein s method works well for dependent random variables , it has been applied , and continues to be applied , to a large number of problems in many different fields .",
    "the method , together with its applications , continues to grow and remains a very active research area .",
    "see , for example , stein @xcite , arratia , goldstein and gordon @xcite , barbour , holst and janson @xcite , diaconis and holmes @xcite , barbour and chen @xcite , chatterjee , diaconis and meckes @xcite , chen , goldstein and shao @xcite , ross @xcite , shih @xcite , nourdin and peccati @xcite , and chen and rllin @xcite .    in a nutshell ,",

    "the operator used by stein @xcite is given by @xmath44 for @xmath45 , and in poisson approximation , where @xmath35 is the poisson distribution with mean @xmath46 , the operator @xmath38 used by chen @xcite is given by @xmath47 for @xmath48 .",
    "however the operator @xmath38 is not unique even for the same approximating distribution but depends on the problem at hand .",
    "for example , for normal approximation @xmath38 can also be taken to be the generator of the ornstein - uhlenbeck process , that is , @xmath49 , and for poisson approximation , @xmath38 taken to be the generator of an immigration - death process , that is , @xmath50 + w[f(w - 1 ) - f(w)]$ ] .",
    "this generator approach , which is due to barbour @xcite , allows extensions to multivariate and process settings . indeed , for multivariate normal approximation , @xmath51 , where @xmath22 is defined on the euclidean space ; see barbour @xcite and gtze @xcite , and also reinert and rllin @xcite and meckes @xcite .",

    "paul malliavin presented a remarkable theory which extended the powerful calculus of variations to the framework of stochastic calculus .",

    "however , regardless of the application , the central role of the malliavin calculus always consists in proving that some integration by parts formula holds . in the present exposition ,",
