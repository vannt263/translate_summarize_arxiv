    "a small sample of neptune trojans has been accumulated by a variety of surveys ; however , inferences drawn from this sample about the intrinsic distributions of neptune trojan orbital properties have been limited and generally qualitative . the challenge inherent in extracting meaningful information from this sample is accurately determining the properties of the surveys that discovered them , and the properties of all surveys that , while sensitive to neptune trojans , did not discover any . in this work",
    ", i treat these unknown survey properties as nuisance parameters , and marginalize over them to extract as much useful information about the intrinsic orbital distributions of the neptune trojans as possible .    of particular dynamical interest",
    "are the inclination , eccentricity , and libration amplitude distributions .",
    "these distributions encode information about the formation mechanism ( in - situ formation , chaotic capture , or other processes ) and post - formation evolution .",
    "several neptune trojans have remarkably high inclinations ( @xmath7 ) , even though surveys have by - and - large targeted fields near the ecliptic where objects on inclined orbits spend relatively little time .",
    "previous works have noted that this qualitatively indicates the existence of a large , poorly - sampled high - inclination neptune trojan population ( sheppard & trujillo 2006 , sheppard & trujillo 2010a ) .    in this work ,",
    "i simultaneously consider the inclination , eccentricity , and libration amplitude distributions , generate synthetic populations of neptune trojans defined by these distributions , then pass these synthetic populations through `` coverage functions : '' simplified observational filters that are treated as independent functions of heliocentric ecliptic latitude @xmath8 , and heliocentric longitudinal separation from the trojan libration centers @xmath9 ( libration centers located roughly @xmath10 from neptune ) , and inclination .",
    "the properties of these observational coverage functions are then marginalized over , effectively marginalizing the unknown properties of the surveys which discovered the trojans . like the jupiter trojans and other trans - neptunian populations ,",
    "the inclination distribution is modeled as a brown s distribution ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the libration amplitude @xmath12 and eccentricity @xmath13 distributions are both modeled as rayleigh distributions , motivated by the distributions of the jupiter trojans .",
    "the inclination , libration amplitude , and eccentricity distributions are all truncated at upper limits derived from stability constraints , requiring appropriate corrections to their proposal volume and probability density functions .",

    "figure 1 illustrates these properties , and it is clear that trojans have generally been discovered at latitudes significantly lower than their inclinations , even though an object spends roughly 50% of their time at latitudes greater than 70% of their inclination .",
    "only the object 2006 rj@xmath28 was higher than its median latitude at the time of discovery .",
    "this indicates that it is likely that most surveys that discovered neptune trojans targeted the ecliptic , and were therefore strongly biased toward detecting low inclination objects , and yet discovered a surplus of high - inclination objects .",
    "the larger number of known l4 neptune trojans compared to l5 is likely an artifact of the l5 cloud being more poorly surveyed due to its current proximity to the galactic plane .",
    "these neptune trojans were discovered by a variety of surveys , performed at a variety of facilities and under varying conditions , and normally would not represent a sample from which estimating an intrinsic , debiased orbit distribution would be statistically advisable .",
    "however , using appropriate statistical care , we can make a conservative estimate of the range of plausible properties of the neptune trojan orbital distribution by marginalizing over the plausible volume of the unknown characteristics of all discovery surveys .",
    "this _ survey - agnostic _ approach can conceivably be applied to other populations , and since it is performed in a bayesian framework , the outcomes can be meaningfully combined with results from large , monolithic , well - characterized surveys such as des ( eg . , gulbis et al .",

    "libration amplitudes for each clone were measured by assuming that libration is sinusoidal and deriving the sinusoidal half - amplitude from the rms of the @xmath44 samples of the resonant angle over the entire 1 myr integration :    @xmath45    which produces the more appropriate half - amplitude for scaling a sinusoidal model than the usual peak - to - peak definition of @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "the rms produces a value that better reflects the mean libration behavior , while defining the amplitude from peak to peak is sensitive to large , single - cycle excursions of the resonant argument . as such , the rms - defined amplitude is always smaller than the peak - to - peak definition .",

    "that is to say , for each trial , @xmath70 is selected uniformly , and then mapped to @xmath69 given that the model inclination distribution is a brown s distribution . because the nominal functional form for the inclination , libration amplitude , and eccentricity distributions are truncated at some upper limit , their means are not trivial to compute .",
    "for example , the mean of a non - truncated rayleigh distribution is simply given by @xmath71 , but for a truncated rayleigh the mean is given by    @xmath72    where @xmath73 is the truncation value ( see appendix [ raymeanappendix ] for a derivation and more details ) .",

    "instead , i adopt a set of basis functions informed by typical trans - neptunian object survey strategies which represent the coverage of the sky by all surveys which _ did discover _ or _ plausibly could have discovered _ neptune trojans",
    ". the parameters of these `` coverage functions '' are allowed to vary , and the discovery circumstances of each known neptune trojan are used to quantify how well a given choice of parameters reproduces them , given a set of assumed orbit distribution parameters . finally , the properties of these coverage functions are marginalized over , and conservative orbit distribution posterior probability density functions are determined .    to model the _ a priori _ unknown survey properties ,",
    "i assume that the probability of detecting a given trojan is essentially independent of its orbital phase save for effects of areal coverage in ecliptic latitude @xmath8 and longitude @xmath79 .",
    "i fold all the effects of survey depth ( which couples with the luminosity function ) and areal coverage into two nuisance `` coverage functions '' @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "these represent the probability of any survey detecting a neptune trojan given the trojan s ecliptic latitude and longitude at the time of discovery .",
    "nominally , these coverage functions will ( 1 ) only depend on ecliptic latitude and longitude , ( 2 ) likely be monotonic away from the centers of the trojan clouds , and ( 3 ) have a functional range bracketed by the interval [ 0,1 ] and a domain over the entire sky .",
    "in addition to modeling survey coverage in ( @xmath82 ) , i also include the possibility of a direct bias against high - inclination objects in the mpc database .",
    "the cfeps survey found moderately higher inclination distribution widths @xmath83 for the 3:2 population than previous studies ; because cfeps carefully characterized their tracking biases in a self - consistent way , they suggested that earlier samples of objects with sufficiently accurate orbits to be confidently characterized as members of the 3:2 population may have had an unacknowledged bias against high inclinations .",

    "it is likely that similar ecliptic latitude and inclination biases apply to the 3:2 population as to the neptune trojan population ; most surveys that discovered 3:2 objects were capable of discovering neptune trojans as well , as both populations share broad inclination distributions ( and therefore both occupy a broad swath of ecliptic latitudes ) , similar on - sky rates of motion , and probably share similar luminosity functions .    the intrinsic properties of the 3:2 population have been measured by the carefully calibrated cfeps survey ( petit et al .",

    "i begin with an ansatz of an appropriate functional form for the ecliptic latitude coverage function @xmath80 :    @xmath91    this form has substantial flexibility provided by three free parameters , but the 3:2 observations constrain them to be strongly correlated . in general , its behavior for small @xmath8 is driven by index @xmath92 and half - width @xmath93 , while for large @xmath8 the function flattens to a constant probability floor set by @xmath94 .",

    "i then consider the functional form of a possible inclination bias . in this case",
    ", there is useful information in literature to inform our functional ansatz : namely , that cfeps and other surveys all found that the _ form _ of the 3:2 population s inclination distribution was well - modeled by a brown s distribution  @xmath97  but they found significantly different widths . in that case",

    "naive extrapolation from the simulations performed here suggest that capture efficiencies in such a scenario would be low , and may require problematically - massive initial disks if reduced by several orders ; however , as previously noted , the capture efficiencies determined by the simulations presented here could be very sensitive to the assumptions of the primordial disk s radial structure and extent .",
    "investing in simulations of capture simulations with much longer migration timescales than those considered here would be worthwhile .",

    "the neptune trojans have a high mean inclination ; this work has demonstrated that if the population s inclination distribution is well - modeled by a truncated brown s distribution like other resonant minor planet populations , then the width of that distribution must be greater than @xmath284 under conservative assumptions . by simulating the capture of neptune trojans from a dynamically - excited disk by a migrating , eccentric neptune",
    ", i have shown that the inclination widths generally do not change drastically between the initial disk and the captured trojan population ; what change there is does not come in large part from stirring during the capture process , but rather from preferential capture of inclined objects .",

    "migration of planets driven by interactions with excited disks has not yet been explored in great detail .",
