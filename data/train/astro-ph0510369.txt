    "the growth of quasars and supermassive black holes is a topic of fundamental interest in cosmology , critically informing theories of black hole formation and accretion models , and the role of black hole energetics in the x - ray , uv , and infrared backgrounds and their consequences for reionization .",
    "it is now believed that supermassive black holes reside at the centers of most if not all galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "furthermore , recent discoveries of correlations between masses of black holes in nearby galaxies and either the mass ( magorrian et al . 1998 ; mclure & dunlop 2002 ; marconi & hunt 2003 ) or velocity dispersion ( i.e. the @xmath0 relation : ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ) of spheroids demonstrate a fundamental link between the growth of supermassive black holes and galaxy formation .",
    "observations of the nearby universe suggest that rapid black hole growth may be related to gas inflows in the centers of galaxies , powering intense infrared emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with mergers or interactions of galaxies providing the gravitational torques necessary to drive large quantities of gas to galaxy centers ( e.g. barnes & hernquist 1991 , 1996 ) to fuel both starbursts @xcite and rapid , self - regulating black hole growth @xcite .",
    "this picture of quasar activity , whether represented in analytical or numerical models of the @xmath0 relation @xcite , semi - analytical models or computer simulations of galaxy and quasar formation @xcite , or modeling of quasar light curves and the quasar and elliptical galaxy luminosity functions ( hopkins et al .",
    "2005a - g ) , implies that black hole growth should be dominated by radiatively efficient , relatively short phases at high accretion rates ( @xmath1 of eddington ) .",
    "this picture is supported by inferred black hole accretion histories from the quasar luminosity function ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as direct observations of quasar accretion rates at different redshifts @xcite or models which combine all of these based on quasar evolution and the observed luminosity function @xcite .",
    "however , these inferences are generally model dependent , and more importantly are based on quasar observations which , while in some cases probing x - ray luminosities well below @xmath2 and much fainter than bright optically selected quasars , do not include the ( at least locally ) very large low accretion rate , radiatively inefficient population .",
    "it is not clear how strongly constrained is the possibility of black holes gaining a significant amount of mass in much lower accretion rate phases after periods of early , bright activity ; in these latter phases the radiative efficiency may drop , and thus the black holes will not usually be observed .",
    "various authors have attempted to use observational estimates of the distribution of quasar accretion rates as a function of redshift to answer the question of whether or not all black holes pass through and gain their mass in a high - eddington ratio bright quasar phase ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although the determination of the distribution and evolution of quasar accretion rates remains a key outstanding problem , selection effects limit the questions these high - redshift observations can answer .",
    "these surveys are generally complete only down to accretion rates @xmath3 of eddington , and at any given redshift only a small fraction of black holes are `` active '' with eddington ratios above this fraction . surveys which can probe lower accretion rates have yielded very different results for the number and distribution of objects with accretion rates in the range @xmath4 eddington ( compare , e.g.  the estimates of vanden berk et al .  2005 from sdss and kollmeier et al .",
    "2005 from ages ) .",
    "consequently , although the observations described above may suggest otherwise , these high - redshift measurements of the accretion rate distribution at large eddington ratios can not determine whether or not a significant population of black holes exists at accretion rates @xmath5 of eddington , sufficient to dominate their mass growth and total mass density by @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , estimating the mass growth of individual black holes ( as opposed to the integrated growth of the population as a whole ) in the observed high - accretion rate phases is not directly possible , as the duration of this phase is degenerate with the rate at which quasars are `` triggered '' or `` activated '' at these rates . even indirectly",
    ", neither quantity is well - constrained , as e.g.  the duration of this phase is currently restricted observationally only to the range @xmath7yr @xcite .    at low accretion rates ( relative to eddington ) , black holes transition to radiatively inefficient accretion flows ( riaf / adaf , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , making these objects especially difficult to observe , and implying that observational surveys may be an order of magnitude less deep in terms of intrinsic accretion rate than they are in terms of a radiative ( @xmath8 ) eddington ratio .",
    "it is therefore especially important to consider the distribution of accretion rates at low redshifts , where objects with low eddington ratios can be reliably detected , as a constraint on possible black hole growth in low eddington ratio states .",
    "the fact that the population of low eddington ratio sources , which must exist at all moderate and low redshifts ( owing to limits on the integrated black hole mass and x - ray luminosity density as discussed above ) , is observed at @xmath6 to extend to accretion rates as low as @xmath9 of eddington strongly emphasizes this point , as these accretion rates are unlikely to be observable in high - redshift surveys in the near future .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the @xmath6 observed distribution of accretion rates and determine whether or not it allows for significant mass growth in radiatively inefficient , low accretion rate states .",
    "there are three basic questions one could ask :    * ( 1 ) * in which state  radiatively inefficient , low accretion rate , or radiatively efficient , high accretion rate  do black holes spend most of their _ time _ ?    * ( 2 ) * in which state do black holes gain most of their _ mass _ ?    * ( 3 ) * in which state do black holes radiate most of their _ luminosity _ ?    according to current wisdom ,",
    "the answer to question * 1 * is the radiatively _ inefficient _ state , and that to question * 3 * is the radiatively _ efficient _ state .",
    "however , question * 2 * is rather delicate ; it is by no means straightforward to deduce its answer from the other answers .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to investigate question * 2 * in depth using the @xmath6 distribution of black hole masses and accretion rates .",
    "we describe the observed sample from @xcite and compare with that of @xcite , and discuss possible selection effects in   [ sec : sample ] . in   [ sec : mdots ] we discuss the dependence of bolometric corrections and radiative efficiency on accretion rate and our accounting for this in determining the distribution of accretion rates . in   [ sec : morph ] we consider the distribution of accretion rates as a function of host galaxy morphology .",
    "we discuss several models for the mass growth of black holes and their implications for the possibility of mass gain in low accretion rate states in ",
    "[ sec : models ] , and finally summarize our conclusions in ",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we consider the observed sample of @xcite , itself an update of the compilation of black hole masses in @xcite , which includes black hole masses , b - band luminosities , redshifts , and host galaxy morphological information for 80 nearby supermassive black holes .",
    "the measurement methods for black hole masses and luminosities , and possible selection effects , are discussed in detail in @xcite , but we briefly review them here .    the majority of the black hole masses are derived from spatially resolved observations of gas and/or stellar kinematics ( for a review of the methods , see e.g.  kormendy & richstone 1995 ) .",
    "there are a few exceptions , namely sgr a@xmath10 in the milky way , whose mass is estimated based on proper motions of individual stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , four galaxies which have strong water maser emission ( ngc 1068 , ngc 4945 , circinus , ngc 4258 ; greenhill et al .  1996 , 1997 , 2000",
    "; miyoshi et al .",
    "1995 , respectively ) , and arp 102b for which the orbital period of the accretion disk has been determined @xcite . in @xcite , the differences between masses estimated by different means of dynamical modeling of the integrated spectroscopy ( primarily @xmath11 spectroscopy of stellar dynamics in the central regions of each galaxy ) are discussed .",
    "three - integral dynamical modeling of the galaxy surface brightness profiles and stellar absorption lines is used to estimate the black hole masses , which tends to give slightly lower black hole masses than the simplified axisymmetric two - integral modeling of e.g.  @xcite @xcite .    for more luminous or distant active galactic nuclei ( agn ) ,",
    "direct dynamical measurements are no longer feasible , as the agn luminosity will overpower the central stellar emission features .",
    "thus , a large fraction of the sample masses are determined via reverberation mapping @xcite of the central emission lines .",
    "the uncertainties of this method are discussed in @xcite , but it is generally true that black hole masses estimated via reverberation mapping agree with those determined from dynamical estimates to within a factor of @xmath12 .",
    "the reverberation - mapped objects of @xcite are compiled from @xcite and @xcite , in which the individual objects are described further .    the optical ( b - band )",
    "luminosities of the sources in the sample are determined using the correlation between h@xmath13 luminosity and b - band absolute magnitude @xcite , as calibrated by @xcite , which is in principle a more isotropic quantity than optical continuum luminosity and is measurable in obscured ( type ii ) agn .",
    "where the b - band magnitude is directly available ( including all of the reverberation - mapped sources ) , it agrees reasonably well with this determination , with no significant systematic bias @xcite .",
    "we do not consider the 17 pg quasars in the @xcite sample , as these objects are chosen from yet another parent sample , at non - negligible redshifts @xmath14 , introducing stronger selection effects .",
    "moreover , they are all at reasonably large eddington ratios @xcite , and thus are members of the class of higher - redshift , high - accretion rate radiatively efficient objects in which we are explicitly not interested .",
    "we have however checked that including them in our total sample results in a negligible difference in the cumulative eddington ratio distribution and our subsequent calculations , after normalizing the relative fraction for the effective volume of the subsample ( i.e.  converting the observed number to a number density ) in figure  [ fig : mdot.dist ] below .",
    "we briefly consider possible selection effects of the different methods by which the black hole masses in this sample are measured . as noted above , strong or bright agn will overwhelm the stellar emission in the central regions of the observed galaxy and make direct measurements of stellar kinematics difficult .",
    "therefore , the objects with masses measured via stellar kinematics may be systematically biased towards lower nuclear luminosities , and correspondingly lower eddington ratios and accretion rates . however , the reverberation - mapped objects are expected to have the opposite bias , as this method of mass measurement requires resolving the agn emission lines , and thus may bias the observed sample to higher eddington ratios and accretion rates .",
    "figure  [ fig : methods ] shows these effects explicitly . here",
    ", the distribution of bolometric luminosities of our entire adopted @xcite sample is shown ( open histograms , left panel ) . since we simply wish to show the luminosity range sampled by the observations we use a constant bolometric correction ( @xmath15 ) , but we adopt more accurate bolometric corrections in   [ sec : mdots ] .",
    "the right panel shows the corresponding distribution of radiative eddington ratios .",
    "horizontally shaded histograms show the distribution for objects with masses determined using gas or stellar dynamics , whereas vertically shaded histograms show the distribution for objects with masses determined using reverberation mapping .",
    "there is a considerable gap in the luminosities probed around @xmath16 , and a similar gap in eddington - scaled luminosities around @xmath17 .",
    "owing to the minimal overlap in the bolometric luminosities covered by either method , it is difficult to reliably determine whether the observed gap in the eddington ratio distribution is real or represents the combination of the selection effects of the two methods .    to test this",
    ", we consider the sample of black hole masses and bolometric luminosities from @xcite , shown in both panels as dot - dashed histograms .",
    "we consider the fr i sample studied by these authors , based on the 298 radio galaxies and 53 radio loud quasars of the 3cr catalogue @xcite .",
    "the black hole masses are estimated from the stellar luminosities of the host galaxy bulges ( except for the bright radio loud quasars , which we do not consider here for the same reason we neglect the high accretion rate quasars in the ho [ 2002 ] sample , although again we have checked and find that the relative number density is not large enough to change our results ) .",
    "the bolometric luminosities are based on fitting the nuclear optical luminosities to the light profiles of the observed galaxies .    the advantage of considering the marchesini et al .",
    "( 2004 ) sample is clear in the left panel of figure  [ fig : methods ] , as it covers the range of bolometric luminosities in which the @xcite samples show a deficit , yielding a combined sample with a smooth ( non - bimodal ) luminosity distribution .",
    "the eddington ratio distribution for these objects is shown in the right panel , and although it peaks at a higher eddington ratio ( @xmath18 ) than the stellar / gas dynamics - measured sample of @xcite , it has a similar qualitative behavior .",
    "furthermore , this higher peak most likely owes to the higher luminosity limit in the @xcite sample .    although including the @xcite sample fills the gap in bolometric luminosity , the gap in eddington ratio at @xmath19 is preserved , a point which is discussed in @xcite . if we consider the combined distribution from the @xcite and @xcite samples , the low - eddington ratio distribution peaks at roughly @xmath20 , more than low enough that our subsequent results are all qualitatively unchanged regardless of whether or not we include the objects in the @xcite sample . based on this ,",
    "the `` gap '' at eddington ratios @xmath21 does not appear to be a selection effect , and we can rely on the @xcite sample in our following analysis .    in the following , we generally do not include the sample of @xcite except where otherwise specified , because it is unclear how to correct for possible bias introduced in considering a radio - loud sample , given the correlation between eddington ratio and radio loudness observed in @xcite .",
    "for further discussion of these distinctions between samples and possible selection effects , we refer to @xcite .",
    "the bolometric luminosity , which we denote by @xmath22 , of a black hole accreting at a rate @xmath23 is @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the radiative efficiency .",
    "therefore , the eddington rate of accretion for a black hole of mass @xmath26 is @xmath27 , where the eddington luminosity of a black hole is well - defined , @xmath28 because the eddington accretion rate depends on the radiative efficiency @xmath25 , which itself can depend on the accretion rate , these definitions are circular unless we define the eddington accretion rate with respect to a canonical radiative efficiency @xmath29 .",
    "we follow standard practice ( e.g.  narayan & yi 1995b ; esin , mcclintock , & narayan 1997 ; jester 2005 , but see also chen et al .",

    "2004 who choose @xmath30 ) in defining @xmath31 which corresponds to the typical radiative efficiency expected from accretion through a standard efficient @xcite thin disk .",
    "we then define the eddington rate as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the salpeter time , the mass @xmath34-folding time for a black hole accreting at the eddington rate with @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "we can further define the dimensionless luminosity eddington ratio @xmath36 and mass accretion rate eddington ratio @xmath37 by @xmath38 with these definitions , we have @xmath39 where we allow explicitly for the possibility that the radiative efficiency may depend on @xmath37 .",
    "we can also define the black hole growth timescale , which corresponds to the mass @xmath34-folding time for growth at a constant eddington ratio , @xmath40 note that this further lets us define a special value of @xmath37 , @xmath41 which is the dimensionless accretion rate for which the growth time is equal to the hubble time ( @xmath4214gyr ) . for significantly lower accretion rates",
    "@xmath43 , the growth timescale is much greater than the age of the universe , and a given black hole can not possibly gain a significant fraction of its mass at that @xmath37 .    for a simple estimate of the accretion luminosity @xmath22 ,",
    "we have followed @xcite and converted from b - band to bolometric luminosities adopting a constant bolometric conversion ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) .",
    "however , the actual bolometric conversion varies , ranging from @xmath46 for bright agn and quasars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to @xmath47 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for the most low - luminosity riaf / adaf systems . for bright agn and quasars , the bolometric conversion @xmath48 appears to depend just on luminosity , although this of course may instead reflect a dependence on the accretion rate . for objects with moderate to large accretion rates",
    ", we adopt the luminosity - dependent bolometric conversions of @xcite , based on observations of the quasar spectrum over a wide range of wavelengths and as a function of luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this gives a b - band luminosity @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "the important point is that @xmath48 _ decreases _ with increasing luminosity ; i.e.  the brightest objects are the most dominated by the optical - uv portion of the spectrum ( see also , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    at low luminosities ,",
    "we consider the sub - sample of low - luminosity agn from @xcite and @xcite , for which bolometric luminosities from radio , optical , uv , and x - ray observations have been determined directly .",
    "calculating the @xmath48 correction for each of these objects , we find no evidence for a direct correlation with @xmath22 , but we do find marginal evidence for a correlation of @xmath48 with observed eddington ratio @xmath51 .",
    "we can fit this dependence roughly to a power law and obtain the best fit @xmath52 as essentially all these objects have @xmath53 ( defined below , but roughly @xmath54 ) , we do not need to worry about a `` break '' in the slope in terms of @xmath36 induced by the change in dependence of @xmath25 on @xmath36 ( i.e.  on @xmath37 ) at @xmath55 . again , we find that the ratio of total to b - band luminosity decreases with increasing luminosity ( though in this case with dimensionless luminosity ) .",
    "this is also consistent with theoretical spectral models of advection - dominated accretion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which generally feature an increasingly hard x - ray spectrum and possibly increased contribution from jets at low @xmath37 .    in order to determine",
    "which objects should receive which bolometric correction , we divide our sample in two on the basis of our original calculation of @xmath36 . for objects with @xmath56 ( defined below ) ,",
    "we apply the bolometric corrections of @xcite , which are primarily derived from bright , high - accretion rate objects . for objects with @xmath57",
    ", we apply the corrections derived from @xcite and @xcite , whose samples are essentially all below this accretion rate .",
    "although the exact point at which we determine the divide in bolometric corrections is somewhat arbitrary , this choice is consistent with theory and observations in both cases , and it is not a significant uncertainty as the two sets of corrections give similar results for the objects in the transition region .",
    "observations of x - ray binaries have revealed a number of distinct spectral states , such as the high soft state , low hard state , quiescent state , etc .",
    "( see mcclintock & remillard 2005 for a review ) .",
    "moreover , the same black hole can exhibit different states at different times .",
    "a primary cause of the various states is changes in the mode of accretion , as suggested by narayan ( 1996 ) and esin , mcclintock & narayan ( 1997 ) . according to this model , accretion flows with @xmath58 greater than a critical value @xmath59 are radiatively efficient and",
    "are well - described by a thin disk model .",
    "these systems correspond to the high soft spectral state . however , for @xmath60 , the accretion flow switches to a two - zone state in which the thin disk is restricted to radii @xmath61 greater than a transition radius @xmath62 , while the gas inside @xmath62 accretes via a radiatively inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ) , also known as an advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ; narayan & yi 1994 , 1995b , narayan 2004 ) .",
    "this is the low hard state , or ( at very low @xmath58 ) the quiescent state .",
    "the transition radius @xmath62 is only slightly larger than the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit when @xmath58 is just below @xmath63 , but it increases to larger values as @xmath58 decreases further ( see yuan & narayan 2004 ) . consequently , the radiative efficiency is fairly close to @xmath64 when @xmath58 is just below @xmath59 , but it decreases rapidly ( but smoothly ) as @xmath58 decreases below @xmath59 ( see equation  [ [ eqn : rad.eff ] ] below ) .",
    "observations suggest that the different accretion states observed in x - ray binaries exist as well in agn @xcite .",
    "it appears that the transition between accretion states occurs at more or less the same critical eddington ratio @xmath65 , regardless of the mass of the accreting black hole .",
    "although the value of @xmath59 is somewhat uncertain ( see the discussion below on hysteresis ) , observations of black hole binaries @xcite as well as theoretical extensions of accretion models ( e.g. , * ? ?",

    "* ) suggest @xmath66 .",

    "what value of @xmath59 should we use ?",
    "it has been observed in x - ray binaries that there is a hysteresis phenomenon in the transition between radiatively inefficient and radiatively efficient accretion flows ( see , e.g.  maccarone & coppi 2003 and references therein ; barret & olive 2002 ) . the transition from the radiatively inefficient state ( adaf ) to the radiatively efficient ( thin - disk ) state often occurs at a fairly large accretion rate @xmath75 whereas the reverse transition ( from radiatively efficient , to inefficient accretion ) occurs at a much lower @xmath76 .",
    "this implies that when @xmath37 _ increases _ with time , the critical accretion rate may be as high as @xmath77 , whereas when @xmath37 decreases with time @xmath78 .",
    "since the peak iof quasar activity occurred at high redshift and the activity declined more or less monotonically to the present epoch , one expects that the lower value of @xmath66 is more relevant for our analysis .",
    "however , the possibility of hysteresis does introduce a degree of uncertainty in our model .",
    "therefore , we consider in our subsequent analysis both @xmath79 and @xmath80 , and ultimately find that the choice does not qualitatively change our conclusions .",
    "figure  [ fig : mdot.dist ] shows the distribution of dimensionless accretion rates @xmath37 obtained from the observed sample using equation  ( [ eqn : rad.eff ] ) ( upper panels ) .",
    "the left panel shows the result for @xmath80 , the right for @xmath79 , essentially bracketing the range allowed by the hysteresis effect discussed above . in each case , we show the distribution for all objects ( empty histograms ) and for just those objects which are morphologically identified as ellipticals ( morphological type index @xmath81 , shaded histograms ) .",
    "we also show the value of @xmath69 ( dashed line ) , the accretion rate for which the black hole growth timescale is equal to the hubble time .",
    "although the result is slightly stronger for the elliptical subsample , the critical point is the same in both cases : even after accounting for the fact that the black holes are in a radiatively inefficient state and thus the actual accretion rate is significantly larger than the observed luminosity eddington ratio , most local objects are accreting at eddington ratios @xmath82 ; i.e.  at very low accretion rates at which significant fractional mass gain in less than the age of the universe is not possible .",
    "although the choice of @xmath55 systematically shifts the inferred @xmath37 at very low @xmath72 , it has almost no effect in the range of interest , @xmath83 .",
    "the bolometric corrections we adopt also slightly increase the characteristic @xmath37 over that implied by e.g.  a constant @xmath45 ( in other words , simpler bolometric corrections only strengthen this point ) , although the difference is negligible for all but the smallest ( @xmath84 ) and largest ( @xmath85 ) accretion rates .",
    "we can also attempt to use the observed sample accretion rate distribution to ( very roughly ) infer that of the population as a whole .",
    "we estimate a simple visibility volume correction , using the distances to each object in @xcite . comparing the maximum distances or distances within which @xmath86 of each ( dynamical or reverberation - mapping mass measurements ) subsample are located",

    "we caution that these distributions are rough estimates and should be taken heuristically , as in truth the selection effects involved in measuring individual black hole masses are much more complicated than , e.g. , a simple magnitude limit .",

    "the @xmath37 distributions broadly agree , and suggest that the @xmath37 distribution can be approximated as a power - law ( or series of power laws ) over a wide range in @xmath37 .",

    "the estimates from observations in figure  [ fig : mdot.dist ] do at least provide a reasonable upper limit @xmath94 , which allows us to calculate the quantities of particular interest ( e.g.  upper limits to the mass gain in low - efficiency phases ) , given that @xmath13 is also reasonably well - constrained in the range above .",
    "although these estimates are by no means a rigorous determination of the @xmath37 distribution , they do provide approximate constraints and upper limits , which imply that our subsequent calculations ( e.g.  the mass - weighted effective @xmath37 and @xmath95 ) can not be qualitatively changed within the allowed uncertainty in figure  [ fig : mdot.dist ] .      using the intrinsic mass accretion rates estimated above , accounting for both the dependence of radiative efficiency on accretion rate and spectral shape ( bolometric corrections ) on luminosity and accretion rate",

    "[ fig : morph ] , we show the black hole growth timescale @xmath96 for each object in the sample of @xcite as a function of the host galaxy morphology ( morphological type index ) , where the host galaxy hubble types are determined in @xcite ( rc3 ) .",
    "the dashed line in the figure shows the hubble time , @xmath97gyr .",
    "it is clear that essentially all objects with moderate to large accretion rates ( i.e.@xmath98 ) are spirals , whereas almost every elliptical has a negligible mass accretion rate ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "this is also clear in figure  [ fig : mdot.dist ] , and is well known from a number of other observations ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "observational studies of the @xmath6 black hole mass function estimated from observations of galaxy luminosity functions and the distribution of spheroid velocity dispersions have established that the total present black hole mass density is dominated by black holes in elliptical hosts , with at most a comparable contribution from black holes in s0 host galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if , as is clear in figure  [ fig : morph ] , the large majority of present elliptical galaxies have @xmath99 , this implies that the majority of the present black hole mass density can not have been accumulated in the observed low - accretion rate phase , but that ellipticals must have experienced a previous phase with high - efficiency accretion .",
    "furthermore , regardless of whether or not all bright quasar activity is the result of galaxy mergers or interactions , it is difficult to imagine a major merger which does _ not _ excite bright quasar activity ( so long as a reasonable amount of cold , rotationally supported gas is present in either of the merging galaxies ) . if elliptical galaxies are formed from the merger of gas - rich spiral progenitors , as is expected in hierarchical scenarios of structure formation ( e.g.  toomre & toomre 1972 , toomre 1977 ; for a review , see barnes & hernquist 1992 ) , then it is difficult to construct a scenario whereby an elliptical galaxy forms without _ some _ period of rapid , high-@xmath37 accretion , which need only occur for @xmath100yr to dominate an entire hubble time worth of accretion at the present ( @xmath6 ) rate .",
    "indeed , the gas dissipation that would fuel the growth of supermassive black holes is required if galaxy mergers are to explain the high phase space densities ( e.g. hernquist et al .",
    "1993 ) , kinematic properties ( e.g. cox et al . 2005 ) , and fundamental scaling relations ( e.g. robertson et al . 2005 ) of ellipticals .",
    "could each black hole accrete at roughly a constant @xmath37 during its entire lifetime",
    "? if this is the case , then objects with @xmath101 have @xmath102 , and do not gain mass in a hubble time , whereas objects with @xmath103 with @xmath104 experience many @xmath34-foldings .",
    "thus there should be a strong change in the black hole mass distribution at @xmath105 , with much higher black hole masses for @xmath106 .",
    "figure  [ fig : dm.dist ] shows the black hole mass as a function of growth time @xmath107 for each object in our sample ( ellipticals filled , late - types open ) , with the dashed line marking the hubble time .",
    "clearly , the predicted trend is not evident ; if anything , the most massive objects in our sample have the _ lowest _ accretion rates ( highest @xmath107 ) .",
    "this trend has been studied in greater statistical detail by @xcite .",
    "the conclusion of the previous subsection is that @xmath37 must vary with time and that the mass growth in many systems must occur in an earlier phase of high @xmath37 accretion .",
    "we now ask whether low efficiency , low accretion rate growth can give a significant fractional contribution to the absolute black hole mass density or individual black hole masses at @xmath6 .",
    "the answer to this depends on the time history of the accretion rate , for which we need to adopt some reasonable model .",
    "consider a general model in which @xmath108 at early times and then decays as a power - law in time , peak phase with @xmath108 , @xmath109 any such model will naturally produce a power - law distribution of accretion rates at low @xmath37 ( equation  [ [ eqn : pwrlaw.mdot ] ] ) with @xmath110 and @xmath111 ( and in the appropriate limits , can also represent exponential or step - function decay ) .",
    "the observed @xmath37 distributions are broadly consistent with the above model for @xmath112 ( see figure  [ fig : mdot.dist ] ) . simulations of quasar light curves @xcite suggest @xmath113 , as does connecting @xmath6 accretion rates at @xmath114 to a bright @xmath115 phase of duration @xmath116yr implied by a wide range of observations ( see martini 2004 , and references therein ) .",
    "we therefore adopt @xmath117 ( this choice also allows analytical solutions below ) , but our calculations are only changed by factors @xmath118 for other values of @xmath119 .",
    "simulations and theoretical models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a wide range of observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and our estimated upper limit @xmath94 ( simply from the existence of a significant population of low-@xmath37 observed ellipticals ) imply a bright ( high-@xmath37 ) quasar lifetime @xmath120yr , setting a fairly strict upper limit @xmath121yr .",
    "the above model of @xmath122 with @xmath117 gives , for an initial black hole mass @xmath123 , the following result for the mass growth as a function of time , @xmath124 i.e.  the object grows exponentially as @xmath125 for @xmath126 and asymptotes to @xmath127 as @xmath128 . if @xmath129 , then growth is large , but this is because the black hole spends a great deal of time in bright , high-@xmath37 phases before the accretion rate slowly drops off .",
    "in fact , even after a hubble time , the accretion rate would still be large . to reach @xmath130 by @xmath131",
    "requires @xmath132 , yielding a small mass gain at low @xmath37 ; the maximum fraction of the present black hole mass which can be accreted at @xmath133 by the present is @xmath134 with @xmath135 .",
    "more complex and host - galaxy dependent quasar light curves have been obtained in hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy mergers incorporating gas cooling , a multiphase interstellar medium , bondi - hoyle accretion determined from the surrounding gas properties , and thermal feedback from accretion @xcite . despite the fact that these light curves show most objects spend significantly more time at luminosities and accretion rates well below the peak quasar luminosity @xcite , the authors find that the mass growth is dominated by efficient phases , with @xmath136 of mass accumulated in bright , optically observable @xmath115 quasar phases ( rising to @xmath137 of the mass in the most massive objects @xmath138 ) , and the remaining mass essentially entirely acquired in the short following phase of declining @xmath37 at moderate @xmath139 @xcite .      using the parameterization of the quasar light curve given in equation  ( [ eqn : mdot.decay ] )",
    ", we can define an `` effective '' mass - weighted accretion rate @xmath140 , i.e.@xmath141 which can be evaluated numerically for a given @xmath142 .",
    "this gives @xmath143 for @xmath144yr and @xmath145 respectively , in good agreement with other estimates of the typical accretion rates at which black holes gain most of their mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it requires a very large @xmath146 to give low @xmath147 , but such long quasar lifetimes are ruled out by a number of arguments as discussed above . using the fitted power laws of @xcite gives a significantly shallower decay , @xmath148 , but similar @xmath149 for @xmath144yr and @xmath145 .",
    "if we use the binned @xmath37 distribution of figure  [ fig : mdot.dist ] directly , we obtain @xmath150 for @xmath144yr and @xmath145 , with a negligible difference if we assume @xmath79 or @xmath80 . the difference due to how we estimate the correction to an `` intrinsic '' @xmath37 distribution is also small compared to the expected poisson noise from the small sample . assuming the distribution cuts off at the lowest observed @xmath37 sets an upper limit on the duty cycle ( lower limit on @xmath140 ) independent of @xmath151 ( see equation  [ eqn : pwrlaw.mdot ] ) , giving @xmath152 .",
    "we can similarly define an `` effective '' mass or luminosity - weighted radiative efficiency , replacing @xmath37 with @xmath95 in equation  ( [ eqn : mdot.wt ] ) above .",
    "our `` canonical '' radiative efficiency @xmath153 can be factored out of this equation , and we can then numerically calculate the resulting @xmath154 for a given @xmath142 and @xmath55 . for a relatively large @xmath145 , we obtain @xmath155 . for a shorter timescale @xmath156yr",
    "these estimates increase to @xmath157 . likewise ,",
    "if we adopt just the observed distribution of accretion rates as the pdf for accretion rate over each agn lifetime as for @xmath140 , we obtain @xmath158 for @xmath159yr , and @xmath160 for @xmath161 ( and values closer to @xmath162 for @xmath163 ) .",
    "if we were to weight by luminosity instead of mass , we would be even further biased towards @xmath164 .",
    "thus , for reasonable values of the quasar lifetime , the `` effective '' radiative efficiencies expected are quite similar to the canonical values adopted for bright quasars ; essentially , this is a restatement of our previous derivation that most mass / luminosity is accumulated / radiated in radiatively efficient , high accretion rate phases .      we can also attempt to estimate the accretion rates and growth timescales of the elliptical galaxies observed .",
    "if we assume that the gas in these galaxies is virialized and is in spherical hydrostatic equilibrium and adopt a @xcite profile for the static potential ( set by stars and dark matter ) we can determine the central sound speed and density , and estimate the accretion rate at the bondi - hoyle rate . using the @xmath0 and @xmath165 relations measured by @xcite and @xcite , respectively , we obtain @xmath166 where @xmath167 is a constant which depends on the profile and gas equation of state , @xmath168 for the assumptions above and @xmath169 , @xmath170 is the spheroid dynamical time , @xmath171 is the gas mass fraction , and @xmath172 is the expected @xmath0 black hole mass .",
    "comparison with figure  [ fig : dm.dist ] suggests that equation  ( [ eqn : bondi ] ) provides a good order - of - magnitude estimate for the ellipticals in our observed sample ( typical @xmath173 ) .",
    "of course , there is no particular evidence in the observations for the weak dependence on @xmath174 given by our model .",
    "but this further suggests that these objects must have gone through a previous bright phase , to heat the gas to virial temperatures and lower the gas fraction to @xmath5 typical in observed ellipticals .",
    "moreover , note that @xmath175 ; i.e.",
    "if a black hole is undermassive , it will take longer to grow , meaning it is unlikely that these black holes grew to their observed @xmath0 masses via slow , quiescent accretion . finally , in essentially all cases where the bondi accretion rates of low-@xmath37 agn have been determined @xcite , as well as the same in x - ray binaries ( e.g. * ?",
    "* ) , it is observed that objects are actually accreting well _ below _ the bondi rate .",
    "thus , the fact that our estimate above provides an approximate agreement with the observed growth timescale suggests that we may actually be significantly overestimating the accretion rates of low-@xmath37 agn , making our conclusions even stronger .",
    "this may be related , for example , to the fact that in the milky way case , an external observer would likely associate a significant amount of nearby but ( owing to our proximity compared to agn in other galaxies ) separately resolved emission with sgr a@xmath10 , because the agn luminosity is not large enough to overwhelm these sources ( see the discussion in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we have determined the distribution of accretion rates of @xmath6 supermassive black holes from the sample of @xcite , including the effects of changing radiative efficiency at low accretion rates in radiatively inefficient accretion flows and the dependence of bolometric corrections on both luminosity and accretion rate .",
    "we find that most local black holes have very low accretion rates @xmath176 , well below the minimum accretion rate @xmath177 required to grow significantly over the entire age of the universe .",
    "this is especially true in the case of supermassive black holes in elliptical galaxies , implying that the dominant part of the integrated black hole mass density was formed in radiatively efficient high-@xmath37 phases , as is expected if these galaxies have undergone mergers in the past which would fuel quasar activity and eventually heat or expel gas in some form of self - regulated growth ( di matteo et al 2005 , springel et al .",
    "we have further discussed models for the accretion rate as a function of time or distribution of accretion rates given the observed @xmath6 distribution , and find in all cases that the accumulated mass should be dominated by mass gained in efficient , high-@xmath37 phases .",
    "it is only possible to gain significant mass in low-@xmath37 phases in these models with a high degree of fine - tuning of the quasar lifetime , giving values inconsistent with both theory and observations .",
    "furthermore , scaling with redshift is not expected to change our results significantly , and it is increasingly difficult for black holes to gain any mass in low-@xmath37 states if a previous , high - efficiency mass gain period is suppressed .",
    "we do not expect that selection effects will significantly change our results .",
    "we have compared directly the sample of @xcite and the combined samples of @xcite and @xcite , and find identical qualitative results .",
    "we have considered separately different classes of black holes measured by different techniques , namely reverberation - mapping and stellar kinematics , and find that the two methods yield similar qualitative results despite having essentially opposite biases . however , because the two methods have opposite biases , current measurements with either method only minimally overlap at bolometric luminosities @xmath178 , allowing the possibility of a bias against sources with accretion rates @xmath179 .",
    "the addition of the @xcite sample spans this gap in luminosity , while preserving the deficit of objects at these accretion rates .",
    "based on the @xmath6 distribution of accretion rates , the integrated mass of the black hole population must have been gained in earlier , radiatively efficient , high-@xmath37 ( @xmath85 ) phases .",
    "likewise , the mass growth of most individual black holes must be dominated by high-@xmath37 rapid growth .",
    "this is in good agreement with a range of inferred accretion histories from observations of quasar populations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and direct observations of quasar accretion rates and their evolution with redshift @xcite .",
    "it similarly agrees well with theoretical models of the relation between black hole mass and host galaxy mass or velocity dispersion @xcite and semi - analytical modeling of galaxy and quasar formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "recently , more detailed modeling of quasar light curves and the implied rate of formation of sources from the observed luminosity functions ( hopkins et al .",
    "2005a - g ) also predicts the black hole mass function allowing for luminosity and host galaxy - dependent quasar lifetimes in which mass growth is dominated by a short peak accretion phase of high @xmath37 . unlike all of these previous observational and theoretical constraints , however , our present result is model - independent , and does not involve large uncertainties in e.g.  the evolution of quasars and their fueling mechanisms .    because the radiative efficiency of black hole accretion is expected and observed to decrease at low @xmath37 , this argument is amplified when considering the radiative luminosity of accreting black holes .",
    "that is , the radiative output is even more dominated by high-@xmath37 phases of accretion .",
    "this is consistent with the cosmic ir or x - ray backgrounds , synthesis models of which suggest black hole growth dominated by high-@xmath37 phases ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and relatively short time spent at @xmath180 @xcite , and also with simple arguments which suggest radiative efficiencies equal to or even larger than @xmath181 @xcite .",
    "thus , models in which quasars spend a very large fraction of their time at low luminosities or low accretion rates ( e.g.  hopkins et al .",
    "2005a - g ) are completely consistent with both the observed @xmath6 distribution of accretion rates and the above observations which all suggest that mass growth and radiative output are dominated by short , high-@xmath37 phases .",
    "finally , we have not ruled out the possibility that some small fraction of _ individual _ objects may gain significant mass in low-@xmath37 states . based on the observed @xmath37 distribution ,",
    "this fraction is small , @xmath182 , and we have shown that it does not contribute significantly to the integrated black hole mass density .",
    "however , it could have important implications for the energetics of these objects and their relations to their host galaxies , as feedback may couple differently to the surrounding medium ( in , for example , the form of jets instead of integrated disk radiation , given the low - accretion rate state ; e.g.  narayan & yi 1995a ) .",
    "likewise , it is not clear whether the physical mechanisms responsible for the @xmath0 relation in most systems would apply ( or whether alternative mechanisms might have the same effect ) in low-@xmath37 systems ( although see e.g.  churazov et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "to summarize , the observed @xmath6 distribution of black hole accretion rates constrains the total time black holes spend in different states and the relative contribution of these states to the integrated final black hole mass and luminosity output .    *",
    "( 1 ) * supermassive black holes spend most _ time _ in a low - efficiency , low accretion rate state .",
    "the @xmath6 eddington ratio distribution implies that the bright quasar lifetime @xmath183 .",
    "this means that @xmath5 of a supermassive black hole s lifetime is spent in a bright , high-@xmath37 quasar phase and @xmath184 is spent in a dim low-@xmath37 phase .    *",
    "( 2 ) * nevertheless , the growth of black hole _",
    "mass _ is dominated by the short , high-@xmath37 phase of evolution .",
    "the eddington ratio distribution implies an effective mass - weighted @xmath185 , in good agreement with estimates from a wide range of other observations of quasars .    * ( 3 ) * likewise , the integrated _ luminosity _ radiated is dominated by the high-@xmath37 , high radiative efficiency growth phase .",
    "the effective luminosity - weighted radiative efficiency implied by the observations , coupled with simple models of the quasar evolution , is @xmath186 , where @xmath187 is the radiative efficiency at @xmath108 .",

    "<S> we consider the distribution of local supermassive black hole eddington ratios and accretion rates , accounting for the dependence of radiative efficiency and bolometric corrections on the accretion rate . </S>",
    "<S> we find that black hole mass growth , both of the integrated mass density and the masses of most individual objects , must be dominated by an earlier , radiatively efficient , high accretion rate stage , and not by the radiatively inefficient low accretion rate phase in which most local supermassive black holes are currently observed . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion is particularly true of supermassive black holes in elliptical host galaxies , as expected if they have undergone merger activity in the past which would fuel quasar activity and rapid growth . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss models of the time evolution of accretion rates and show that they all predict significant mass growth in a prior radiatively efficient state . </S>",
    "<S> the only way to avoid this conclusion is through careful fine - tuning of the accretion / quasar timescale to a value that is inconsistent with observations . </S>",
    "<S> our results agree with a wide range of observational inferences drawn from the quasar luminosity function and x - ray background synthesis models , but our approach has the virtue of being independent of the modeling of source populations . </S>",
    "<S> models in which black holes spend the great majority of their time in low accretion rate phases are thus completely consistent both with observations implying mass gain in relatively short , high accretion rate phases and with the local distribution of accretion rates . </S>"
