    "the sunyaev  zeldovich effect  @xcite is a secondary anisotropy on the cosmic microwave background  ( cmb ) radiation due to inverse - compton scattering of cmb photons from hot plasma in the gravitational potential of a cluster of galaxies .",
    "the s  z effect has been detected by a number of different groups using a variety of observing techniques  ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite . see e.g. @xcite or @xcite for a full review ) .",
    "for example , in the past , the cambridge group used the five antennas of the ryle telescope ( rt ) in a compact configuration to produce s  z maps such as that shown in figure  [ a1914rt ]  @xcite .",
    "we detected a s  z decrement towards the cluster a1914 with an integrated flux of @xmath1  mjy and a map noise of 0.06  mjy / beam from a 228-hour observation .",
    "this long integration time was required because the rt has relatively poor system temperature , has bandwidth of only 350  mhz and because the telescope baselines were long compared to the optimum required to match to the angular size of the cluster , with the result that most of the s  z signal is resolved out .",
    "mjy and the noise on the map is 0.06  mjy / beam[a1914rt ] . the field of view is chosen to be the same as that in figures  [ a1914nat ] and [ a1914tap ] for ease of comparison . in this and",

    ", width=302 ]    the s  z effect has the unique property that its surface brightness is independent of redshift .",
    "this makes it ideal as a means of surveying for galaxy clusters back to their epoch of formation .",
    "several dedicated instruments are now being built to conduct such s  z surveys  ( see e.g. @xcite ) . at cambridge , the arcminute microkelvin imager  ( ami ) is being commissioned .",
    "this instrument has been designed to make high - speed , sensitive surveys for s  z decrements by using many small dishes packed together in a compact array with a low noise , high - bandwidth back - end system and complemented by an array of much larger dishes designed to detect and subtract compact foreground radio sources . in this paper",
    "we present a commissioning observation with ami towards a1914 which has previously been observed in s  z  @xcite and in x - ray  ( see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "ami  @xcite comprises two synthesis arrays , one of ten 3.7-m antennas ( small array ) and one of eight 13-m antennas ( large array ) , both sited at lord s bridge , cambridge .",
    "the large array is an upgraded version of the rt , with the three outlying antennas now moved into a compact configuration near the five which we previously used for s  z work .",
    "the telescope observes in the band 1218  ghz with cryostatically cooled nrao indium - phosphide front - end amplifiers .",
    "the overall system temperature is approximately 25  k. the radio frequency is mixed with a 24-ghz local oscillator , downconverting to an intermediate frequency  ( if ) band of 612  ghz .",
    "amplification , equalisation , path compensation and automatic gain control are then applied to the if signal .",
    "the correlator is an analogue fourier transform spectrometer with 16 correlations formed for each baseline at path delays spaced by 25  mm .",
    "in addition , both ` @xmath2 ' and ` @xmath3 ' correlations are formed by use of @xmath4 and @xmath5 hybrids respectively . from these , eight 0.75-ghz channels are synthesised .",
    "the new observations presented here are commissioning runs with just eight antennas of the small array and only the upper six frequency channels ( giving a total of 4.5  ghz of bandwidth ) .",
    "we observed abell  1914 for a total of 34  hours between 2005 august 15 and 2005 august 29 with a pointing centre of 14  26  02.15 + 37  50  05.8  ( j2000 ) .",
    "the observations were phase and amplitude calibrated on 3c286 .",
    "we take the flux density of 3c286 as 3.48  jy  @xcite in @xmath6 at 15  ghz with a spectrum of @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) ; a correction factor of 1.05 has been assumed to account for the @xmath9 polarisation at position angle @xmath10 of the source .",
    "specialist ami data reduction software ( the reduce package ) was used to flag the data for telescope pointing errors , to excise interference , to apply the calibration and to weight the data .",
    "reduced data were then transferred to aips for further analysis .",
    "a naturally weighted map of the a1914 field is shown in figure  [ a1914nat ] and a plot showing the coverage of the aperture plane in figure  [ a1914uvcov ] .",
    "the negative feature at the centre of the cleaned map is the s  z effect from the cluster , but it is confused by several radio sources which are also visible and whose effects must be subtracted .",
    "the brighter sources were mapped individually with the rt at the same frequency to determine their positions and fluxes .",
    "contributions from sources close to the cluster centre were estimated from the 19-day rt observations ( section 1 ) .",
    "once these sources were removed , the ami data were remapped and the fluxes of any remaining faint sources estimated and removed from the visibilities , a method we have found to be successful with previous rt s  z observations  ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in all , 18 sources were subtracted from the visibility data as described in table  [ sources ] .",

    "the integrated s  z flux in the map is @xmath0  mjy and the noise on the map is 0.19  mjy / beam .",
    "it is also possible to make maps of individual frequency channels and use these to measure the frequency spectrum of the s  z effect . since the s  z effect is extended and the aperture plane coverage for each channel is different ( and hence samples different angular scales ) , it is necessary to measure the flux from each of the channels over the same solid angle .",

    "the magnitude of the negative s  z flux is shown for convenience .",
    "the error bars are the @xmath13 errors from the channel maps which are dominated by source confusion ; errors between different channels are therefore not independent .",

    "the s  z effect is detected with extremely high significance ( figure  [ a1914tap ] ) and extended structure is clearly visible . comparing",
    "the map from 34  hours of ami observation with the previous rt map demonstrates the potential of ami as a cluster survey instrument .",
    "maps of short observations that are limited by thermal noise show that the small array sensitivity per channel is approximately @xmath15 , which is consistent with that assumed in our simulations  @xcite .",
    "calculations based on the 9c  survey source counts  @xcite show that the ami maps presented here are limited by source confusion  @xcite rather than thermal noise .",
    "this and the fact that we have had to remove 18 point sources from our data emphasise the importance of source subtraction , which for ami will be provided by the large array .",
    "figure  [ a1914spec ] shows that the spectrum of the decrement measured by ami is consistent with an s  z spectrum , which differs from a thermal spectrum by less than @xmath16 between 13.5 and 18  ghz  @xcite .    in order to make a preliminary comparison of the ami data on a1914 with x - ray observations , we have fitted an isothermal spherical @xmath17-model , assuming a concordance cosmology ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) , to chandra acis - i data using a temperature @xmath21  @xcite , redshift @xmath22 , a count rate calculated from noras  pspc and @xmath23 using the heasarc webpimms tool with a raymond smith profile  @xcite .",
    "we find best fit parameters of @xmath24 , central cluster density @xmath25 and core radius @xmath26 .",
    "using this parameterisation of the intracluster gas , we produce a simulated s  z observation of the cluster following  @xcite .",
    "we map and clean this simulated data set in the same manner as the real data and find that the predicted integrated s  z flux from the x - ray model is @xmath27  mjy .",
    "this is in good agreement with the value of @xmath0  mjy given the assumptions implicit in the model ( e.g. that the line of sight depth through the cluster equals the size of the cluster projected on the sky ) .",
    "a more sophisticated simulation of the intracluster gas is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the ami data discussed in this paper come from a commissioning run ; further system improvements , such as weighting for system temperature variations through synchronous measurement of injected noise , are underway .",
