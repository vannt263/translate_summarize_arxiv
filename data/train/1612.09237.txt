    "this article concerns the growth of certain infinite series defined over prime numbers . in this introduction",
    "we explain the motivation for this study , define the series in question , and briefly summarize some of our results .",
    "let @xmath6 denote a dirichlet character , and as usual define the dirichlet series [ dir ] l(s , ) = _ n=1^ where @xmath7 is a complex variable .",
    "the riemann zeta function @xmath8 corresponds to the @xmath4-function for the trivial character modulo @xmath9 where all @xmath10 . due to the completely multiplicative property of the characters",
    ", @xmath4 enjoys an euler product formula : [ epf ] l(s , ) = _",
    "n=1^@xmath11 ^ -1 where @xmath12 is the @xmath13-th prime .",
    "the above formula is known to be valid for @xmath14 where both sides of the equation converge absolutely . using the validity of the euler product one",
    "can easily see that there are no zeros with @xmath15 ; in particular , @xmath16 is finite in this region since the series converges .",
    "if somehow the euler product were valid for @xmath17 , then the generalized riemann hypothesis would follow by the same argument together with the functional equation that relates @xmath18 to @xmath19 . for riemann @xmath20 itself , and other @xmath4-functions based on _ principal _ dirichlet characters",
    ", it is well understood that the euler product in the above form is not valid for @xmath21 , essentially due to the pole at @xmath22 : domains of convergence of dirichlet series are always half - planes , and due to this pole , the logarithm must be divergent for @xmath23 .",
    "however for _ non - principal _ characters , the associated @xmath4-functions have no pole at @xmath22 , and thus the validity of the euler product for @xmath24 is theoretically possible , although difficult to study .    for the moment , let us not distinguish between the cases of principal verses non - principal characters , although for the reasons discussed above there will subsequently be significant differences . let the character have modulus @xmath25 .",
    "the character @xmath26 if @xmath27 , i.e. @xmath28 are coprime , otherwise @xmath29 .",
    "the non - zero characters are all roots of unity , so let us define the angles @xmath30 : [ thetan ] ( n ) = e^i _ n ,  ( n ) 0 now consider the series [ bnt ] b_n ( t , ) = _",
    "n=1^n @xmath31 where it is implicit that the terms corresponding to the finite number of primes for which @xmath32 are omitted in the sum . in @xcite",
    "it was proven that if @xmath33 as @xmath34 , then the euler product formula is valid for @xmath17 because it converges in this region . the proof involved an abel transform for the logarithm of the euler product , the prime number theorem ( pnt ) , and a bound on the sum over gaps between primes .",
    "let us now specialize to non - principal characters .",
    "because of the half - plane convergence property mentioned above , to establish validity of the euler product formula for @xmath35 for some @xmath36 , it is sufficient to prove convergence at a single value of @xmath37 . since there is no pole at @xmath22 , the simplest choice is @xmath38 .",
    "it is sufficient then to consider the series [ cndef ] c_n = _ n=1^n _ p_n    as stated above , a proof that @xmath39 would establish the validity of the generalized riemann hypothesis for all non - principal characters .",
    "it is a completely deterministic series which depends on the actual primes which are largely unknown for large @xmath40 , thus it is difficult , if not impossible , to compute it for large enough @xmath40 .",
    "however if one is only interested in its growth as a function of @xmath40 , since @xmath41 is a series , the fluctuations coming from the precise values of individual primes may not be important for determining this growth .",
    "in other words , the growth of @xmath41 may only depend on some global properties of the set of primes , such as their average spacing , etc .",
    "in @xcite it was conjectured that @xmath39 based on the heuristic argument that it behaves like a random walk due to the multiplicative independence of the primes . in this article",
    "we apply methods of probability theory to further study this problem .",
    "the idea of using probability methods in number theory is certainly not new , and at least goes back to work of cramr @xcite , which we will utilize .",
    "let @xmath42 denote the set of primes , where @xmath43 and so forth .",
    "we will consider replacing @xmath44 with the set @xmath45 , which are a random , independent , ordered sequence of integers , and will study @xmath46 .",
    "the @xmath47 will be constrained to satisfy some global properties of the known primes , to be specified below .",
    "since the @xmath47 are now random variables , we will consider @xmath48 which is the ensemble of all possible @xmath49 , i.e the set of sets @xmath49 .",
    "we will refer to @xmath50 as the pseudo - prime ensemble , and a specific element @xmath51 as a state of this ensemble .",
    "the actual primes @xmath44 are then simply one state in the pseudo - prime ensemble .",
    "this terminology is borrowed from statistical mechanics in physics .",
    "for instance , for a gas of free particles , the states correspond to specific values for the positions and velocities of every individual particle , and various canonical ensembles are the set of all such states subject to certain constraints , such as the total number of particles or total energy held fixed . in light of this analogy ,",
    "the idea we are pursuing here is that , for example , the macroscopic pressure of a gas of a large number of particles hardly depends on what specific state they are in , which is unknowable , and for the same reasons we expect the global ( macroscopic ) properties of @xmath52 , in particular its growth as a function of @xmath40 , does not depend on the detailed properties of @xmath49 .",
    "the aim of this article to make such statements precise using the theory of probability , as in statistical mechanics .",
    "we need to be specific about the ensemble @xmath50 and its probability measure .",
    "we will require two properties .",
    "the primes @xmath12 are independent , more specifically they are multiplicatively independent .",
    "we thus require the @xmath47 to also be independent .",
    "secondly , we require that the counting of @xmath3 is essentially equivalent to that implied by the prime number theorem .",
    "namely , as usual let @xmath53 be the number of primes less than @xmath54 .",
    "the pnt gives the leading behavior @xmath55 .",
    "let @xmath56 be the analogous quantity for the primes @xmath47 , i.e. the number of @xmath57 .",
    "this counting function is now a random variable , and we require that its expectation value is approximately the leading term in @xmath53 : [ epi ] ( x ) ( x )    there are many possible choices of @xmath50 compatible with these requirements . one particular interesting one is to take @xmath47 to be a random integer satisfying @xmath58 .",
    "remarkably , grosswald and schnitzer @xcite proved that if one defines a @xmath20 function via an euler product from the @xmath59 , as in , then all of these possible @xmath20 s can be analytically continued into the critical strip and have the _ same _ zeros as riemann @xmath20 there .",
    "they proved a similar result for dirichlet @xmath4-functions which will be discussed below . for our purposes however , this choice is more difficult to analyze than necessary . instead we will use a variant of the cramr model @xcite which depends on the modulus of the character @xmath60 .",
    "for instance , in the simplest case of modulus @xmath61 , for each integer @xmath13 , the probability that @xmath62 equals @xmath63 .",
    "we will then prove that @xmath52 obeys a central limit theorem , i.e. when properly normalized , it has a normal distribution :    [ cltc ] for non - principal characters of modulus @xmath25 , [ cltforc ]  c_n    ( 0,1 ) with [ s2 ] s^2 = a where @xmath64 if the characters @xmath60 are all real , ( i.e. all @xmath65 ) , otherwise @xmath66 , @xmath67 is the euler totient , and @xmath68 is the normal distribution with mean @xmath69 and standard deviation @xmath70 .",
    "as @xmath71 , the @xmath72 can of course be neglected , however we retain it in order to provide numerical evidence at large but finite @xmath40 .",
    "we will use this theorem to say something precise about the growth of the original series @xmath41 .    for principal characters all the angles",
    "@xmath73 are zero and one needs to consider now the series [ bndef ] b_n ( t ) = _",
    "n=1 ^n ( t p_n ) here , obviously we are interested in @xmath74 , which as explained above , in relation to the validity of the euler product , this is due to the pole in @xmath8 at @xmath22 .",
    "as before we define @xmath75 as above with @xmath76 . below we will prove a central limit theorem for @xmath75 in the limit of large @xmath37 ( theorem [ cltb ] below ) .",
    "as explained in the introduction , given a non - principal dirichlet character @xmath60 of modulus @xmath25 , we are interested in the series [ cnp ] c_n = _",
    "n=1 ^n   _ p_n where the angles @xmath77 , and @xmath78 is one state in the ensemble @xmath50 appropriate to cramr s model .",
    "we first describe how to implement the cramr model and generate the states @xmath49 in a way that is simple to study both analytically and numerically . for simplicity",
    "we exclude @xmath79 from @xmath49 .",
    "this does not affect the large @xmath40 result we will obtain . for each @xmath80 , let @xmath81 be a random variable uniformly distributed on the interval @xmath82 $ ] , and define @xmath83 as follows [ zndef ] z_n =    1 & @xmath84 + 0 &    then , by definition , for @xmath80 , @xmath62 if @xmath85 .",

    "we have excluded @xmath87 since @xmath88 .",

    "the series @xmath92 defined in the introduction is now modeled as [ cnz ] c_n = _ n=1^p_n _ n summing over all integers up to @xmath93 ensures there are @xmath40 terms in the sum when @xmath61 .",
