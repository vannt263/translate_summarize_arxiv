    "recent relativistic heavy - ion collision ( hic ) studies have recognized the importance of the initial fluctuations on the various order of flows @xcite . for instance",

    "studies on the initial fluctuation effects are only limited in relativistic heavy - ion collision . at these energies ,",
    "the initial fluctuation can be followed by hydrodynamic expansion and result in the long - range azimuthal correlations ( or the anisotropy flows ) .",
    "its energy dependence is thought as one of important observables to study various aspects of the qcd phase diagram in the beam energy scan ( bes ) program at rhic @xcite . in intermediate energy hic ,",
    "no systematic study for the initial fluctuation effects on the collective flow has been presented except a brief report appeared by the same authors of the present work @xcite .",
    "also , the relationship between the eccentricity and squeeze - out ( negative elliptic flow ) is not yet reported to our knowledge .",
    "in contrast with relativistic energy hic , the time scale of collision dynamics is larger ( from tens of fm / c to hundreds of fm / c ) in intermediate energy hic , which may allow the other factors to develop and smear the long - range azimuthal correlations originating from the initial fluctuation .",
    "it is then worth addressing how the initial fluctuation affects on the collective flow in intermediate energy domain .    in this paper , the collective flows",
    "are calculated in a framework of a nuclear transport model , namely isospin quantum molecular dynamics ( iqmd ) , which allows the generation of events with event - by - event fluctuating initial conditions . to explore the effects of the initial fluctuation",
    ", we study the flows as functions of centrality , transverse component of four velocity and rapidity . flow results with respect to different reaction plane determinations are compared with the experimental data .",
    "we also try to reproduce experimental excitation function of elliptic flow with our simulations .",
    "in addition , the relationship of elliptic flow versus eccentricity is discussed in different centralities .",
    "the eos dependence of the collective flow is also presented . at the end",
    ", we will focus on phenomenology of mass - number scaling behavior of different harmonic flows and check the initial fluctuation effect on scaling behavior .",

    "it is observed that there exists the quantitative difference between the average of the sum of @xmath80 and @xmath81 of particles event - by - event in different initial fluctuation values .",

    "however , in contrast with hic in the ultra - relativistic region , the initial fluctuation weakens the squeeze - out flow , which indicates the anisotropy due to initial fluctuation was quenched to some extent by the spectator shadowing effect .",
    "in addition , squeeze - out flow also shows proportional to initial eccentricity , indicating squeeze - out essentially develops from the initial overlapping region .",
    "a quantitative comparison with the excitation function of @xmath92 shows that our simulation data are smaller than the experimental data even though the trend is very close , which may be caused by two reasons .",
    "one is the variation of physical parameters ( like the ground state densities , interaction ranges ) whose precise values are not known ; the other is the complicate input parameters such as eos and in - medium cross section etc are not well decided .",
    "in addition , the flow scaling behaviors for different light fragments are also checked in the present simulation .",
    "it is found that the @xmath87 and @xmath92 of different fragments can be scaled by a function of mass number plus a constant term even the initial fluctuation has been taken into account .",
    "the ratios of @xmath108 and @xmath106 ) demonstrate a constant value which is independent of transverse momentum when the initial fluctuation is not considered .",
    "the value of 1/2 for @xmath108 indicates that the nucleonic coalescence model can explain the fragment flows .",
    "however , when the initial fluctuation is considered , the ratios still keep constant values but much less than the former .",
    "it indicates that even though the scaling behavior is not broken , higher harmonic flows will be much quenched by the initial fluctuation , it is a similar effect of viscous damping .",
