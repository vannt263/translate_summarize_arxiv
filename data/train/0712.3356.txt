    "_ per aspera",
    "ad astra_. after many years of hypotheses and markets of models we now have the standard cosmological model , yet separated from what we have at small scales  the standard model of elementary particles .",
    "both models progressively converge and interact with each other leading us to a joint physical model of the world we are a part of .",
    "the progress in cosmology is ensured by observations .",
    "this creates identification problem .",
    "it is a specific feature of astronomy .",
    "astronomers _ see _ structures unknown to physicists . they can not touch or test them",
    ", they can learn only general properties of observed matters assuming some theoretical extrapolations ( general relativity , atomic physics , etc . ) . on the contrary ,",
    "physicists need experiment to judge things . to understand what astronomers see",
    ", physicists are looking in labs for what is unknown to them , since there is not enough information about the target . in this way",
    "the problem of identification arises .    what do astronomers see",
    "they observe structures made of invisible matter , the _ dark matter_. dm does not interact with light , generally - with luminous matter , or baryons .",
    "how is dm observed then ?",
    "through its gravitational influence on visible matter .",
    "fortunately , light is there where dm concentrations are .",
    "1 shows a region of sky in the direction of one of dm _ halos _ , the non - linear dm concentration gravitationally bound in all three directions with total mass @xmath0 .",
    "we see optical galaxies captured by gravitational field of this concentration , x - ray gas residing at the bottom of the gravitational well , and a multi - image of one of the background galaxies that happened to be on the line of sight of the dm halo and was distorted by its gravitational field .    .",
    "]    we study spatial distribution of dm halos analyzing galaxy catalogs and quasar absorption lines . besides",
    ", the dm surface mass density can be reconstructed via its gravitational week lensing action on numerous background galaxies .",
    "so , there is more than enough independent probes of dark mass inside and beyond dm halos .",
    "we can state that the mean contrast of dm density field is larger than unity at small scale ( @xmath1mpc ) still remaining less than unity at large scale ( @xmath2 mpc ) .",
    "accordingly , we do not find dm halos exceeding @xmath3 .",
    "this is the current dm density field .",
    "we are lucky to have a map of much younger matter density field using cmb anisotropy . that time ( @xmath4 ) the mean density contrast was @xmath5 , and no halos had formed",
    "having these two pictures of cosmic matter distribution at different epochs of its evolution and assuming that only gravity is responsible for such evolution , we can obtain the dm energy - momentum tensor .",
    "what are dm properties ?    actually , they are very simple .",
    "dm is non - relativistic _ weakly interacting massive particles _ with cosmological density five times higher than that of baryons .",
    "wimps should be cold ( non - relativistic ) long before the equality epoch to be able to form the structure that we observe today .",
    "owing to such simple properties , dm has straightforwardly affected the development of the universe gravitational potential .",
    "the dm density contrast was increasing in time due to gravitational instability .",
    "baryons , after they decoupled from radiation , were captured into gravitational wells of dm concentrations .",
    "that is why light is there where dm is , although dm particles do not interact with light .",
    "thanks to this remarkable feature of gravitational instability it is possible to study amount , state and distribution of dm in observations ranging from radio to x - ray bands .",
    "contemporary physics does not know particles with dm properties .",
    "it is necessary to go beyond the standard model . but",
    "how and in which direction ?",
    "what should we look for ?",
    "the analysis of large scale structure in the universe has revealed that the amount of non - relativistic dm entering structure is small .",
    "the overall mass density of all particles which have been involved in the process of gravitational clustering , can not exceed @xmath6 of the critical density .",
    "massive neutrino contribute less than few percent to the matter budget . at the same time the characteristics of cmb anisotropy",
    "have evidenced the flat spatial geometry of our universe .",
    "it means that the rest @xmath7 of the critical density should be in the form that takes no part in gravitational clustering .",
    "what are the properties of such a stable medium which is not perturbed by gravitational potential of the structure and remains essentially unclustered ?",
    "theory gives a clear answer to this question  the pressure - to - energy ratio of this medium , @xmath8 , should satisfy the following condition : @xmath9 only under this inequality the medium remains lorentz - invariant and invariable both in space and time .",
    "_ dark energy_. this is all we know about de .    it is crucial that the process of gravitational instability could be launched in the friedmann universe only if the seed density perturbations were present since the very beginning .",
    "the existence of primordial cosmological perturbations has nothing to do with dm or any other particles .",
    "these are the total density perturbations that were produced by the big bang physics .",
    "thus , another important problem arises , the problem of origin of the seed density perturbations which have developed dynamically into dm structures .    these hot topics  searching for unknown matter and determining the initial conditions for structure formation ",
    "display new physics and are expected to be solved in near future . in this review we dwell upon them .",
    "the observed structure of the universe is a product of start conditions and evolution of matter density field .",
    "up - to - date observational data made it possible to determine characteristics of the density field at different epochs of its development .",
    "it allowed us to separate information about the initial conditions and development conditions , thus giving rise to independent investigations of the early and late universe physics .    in modern cosmology the term `` early universe ''",
    "stands for the final period of the inflationary _ big bang stage _ with subsequent transition to hot period of cosmological expansion .",
    "currently we have no model of the early universe as we do not know bbs parameters ( there are only upper bounds , see eq .",
    "( [ eq-12 ] ) ) .",
    "however , we have a well - developed theory of quantum - gravitational generation of the cosmological perturbations . using this theory",
    ", we can derive the spectra of primordial density perturbations and cosmic gravitational waves as functions of cosmological parameters , and constrain the latter if the spectra are known .",
    "the reason why we still have no generally - accepted model of the early universe stems from stable predictions of bbs inflationary paradigm , that are obtained in a wide class of model parameters .",
    "namely , the generated spectra are almost flat , the amplitude of the cosmological gravitational waves is relatively small , etc .",
    "detection of the cosmological gravitational waves would give crucial information about the early universe .",
    "this discovery may come in case the planck experiment succeeds .",
    "our knowledge of the late universe is quite opposite .",
    "we have rather precise model  we know the main matter components and cosmological parameters , the evolution of the universe and theory of structure formation .",
    "but we do not understand how the matter components have originated .",
    "the known properties of the visible universe allow us to describe the geometry of both , late and early universe , in the framework of the perturbation theory .",
    "there is a small parameter @xmath10 , the amplitude of cosmological perturbations .",
    "the main tool of geometry is metric tensor . to zeroth order",
    "the universe is friedmannian and described with only one time function  the scale factor @xmath11 .",
    "the first order is a bit more complicated .",
    "the metrics perturbations are the sum of three independent modes the scalar one @xmath12 , the vector one @xmath13 , and the tensor one @xmath14 , each of them being described by its spectrum , the function of the wave number @xmath15 .",
    "the scalar mode describes the cosmological density perturbations , the vector mode is responsible for vortical matter motions and the tensor mode presents the gravitational waves . if the first order fields are gaussian then the entire geometry of our universe is described with only four positively defined functions , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath14 and @xmath13 . currently we know the first two functions in some ranges of their definition .",
    "bbs was a catastrophic process of rapid expansion accompanied by intensive time varying gravitational field . under this gravitational action",
    "the small - scale cosmological perturbations of metric and density were being parametrically born from vacuum fluctuations .",
    "it is very general and fundamental effect of creation of any massless degree of freedom in external coupled non - stationary field .",
    "available observational data confirm the quantum - gravitational origin of seed density perturbations responsible for structure formation in the universe .",
    "it is a good example of the solution of measurability problem in quantum field theory .",
    "the basic properties of the perturbation fields generated according to this mechanism are the following : the gaussian statistics ( random distribution in space ) , the preferred time phase ( `` growing '' branch of evolution ) , the absence of characteristic scales in a wide range of wavelengths , a non - zero amplitude of the gravitational waves .",
    "the latter is crucial for building - up the bbs model as gravitational waves couple the simplest way to the background scale factor .",
    "the development of @xmath16-mode has resulted in formation of galaxies and other astronomical objects .",
    "the cmb anisotropy and polarization have emerged long before under the joint action of all three perturbation modes ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) on the photon distribution .",
    "joint analysis of the observational data on galaxy distribution and the cmb anisotropy allowed us to relate @xmath16 and @xmath19 modes . making use of the fact that the sum @xmath20 is known from the cmb anisotropy",
    ", we obtain the upper bound for the vortical and tensor perturbation modes in the visible universe : @xmath21 in case the latter inequality were violated the density perturbation value would not be sufficient to form the observed structure .",

    "let us consider zero order geometry more detailed .    table [ tab : table1 ] presents average values of the cosmological parameters obtained from astronomical observations ( with @xmath23 accuracy ) . with these parameters ,",
    "we obtain from the friedmann equations the hubble function , @xmath24 , and its time derivative , @xmath25 :    = 10 ^ 61= ( + + 0.7)^1/2 , + = = = ,    where @xmath26 is the inverse hubble constant , @xmath27gev@xmath28 cm is the planck mass ( or inverse planck scale , hereafter @xmath29 ) .",

    "the expected mass of these particles is @xmath31 , and their density in our galaxy is a particle per cup of coffee .",
    "dm particles are being searched in many experiments all over the world .",
    "interestingly , the neutralino hypothesis can be independently verified both in underground experiments on elastic scattering and by indirect data on neutralino annihilation in galaxy .",
    "so far the positive signal has been found only in one of the underground detectors ( dama ) , where a season signal of unknown origin has been observed for several years now .",
    "but the range of masses and cross - sections associated with this experiment has not been confirmed in other experiments , which makes reliability and meaning of the results quite questionable .",
    "neutralino give an important possibility of indirect detection by their annihilation gamma - ray flux . during the process of hierarchic clustering these particles",
    "could form mini - halos of the earth masses and characteristic sizes comparable to that of the solar system .",
    "some of these mini - halos could stay intact till now . with high probability",
    "the earth itself is inside one of these halos where the particle density is as much as tens of times higher than the mean halo density .",
    "hence , the probability of both direct and indirect detection of dm in our galaxy gets higher .",
    "availability of so different search techniques gives a solid hope that the physical nature of at one version of dm will soon be verified .",
    "let us consider the first order geometry in more detail .",
    "the effect of the quantum - gravitational generation of massless fields is well - studied .",
    "matter particles can be created with this effect ( see  @xcite etc . ) ( although the background radiation photons emerged as a result of the bbs proto - matter decay in the early universe ) .",
    "the gravitational waves  @xcite and the density perturbations  @xcite are generated in the same way since they are massless fields and their creation is not suppressed by the threshold energy condition . the problem of the vortical perturbation creation is waiting for its researchers .",

    "@xmath40 is a transversal and traceless component of the metric tensor , @xmath41 in the case of the @xmath16 mode @xmath42 is a linear superposition of the longitudinal gravitational potential ( the scale factor perturbation ) and the potential of the 3-velocity of medium times the hubble parameter  @xcite : @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 .    as it is seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq-3 ] ) , the field @xmath46 is fundamental , because it is minimally coupled with background metrics and does not depend on matter properties ( in general relativity the speed of gravitational waves is equal to the speed of light ) . on the contrary ,",
    "the relation between @xmath47 and the external field  ( [ eq-4 ] ) is more complicated : it includes both derivatives of the scale factor and some matter characteristics ( e.g. the speed of perturbation propagation in the medium ) .",
    "we do not know anything about the proto - matter in the early universe .",
    "there are only general suggestions concerning this problem .",

    "the ideal medium concept is equivalent to the field concept where the lagrangian density @xmath57 is ascribed to the material field @xmath51  @xcite-  @xcite . in the field",

    "the evolution of the elementary oscillators is given by klein - gordon equation : @xmath61 where @xmath62 the solution of eq.(10 ) has two asymptotics : an adiabatic one ( @xmath63 ) when the oscillator freely oscillates with the excitation amplitude being adiabatically damped ( @xmath64 ) , and a parametric one ( @xmath65 ) when the @xmath39 field freezes out ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "the latter conditions in respect to quantum field theory implies a parametrical generation of a pair of particles from the state with an elementary excitation ( see fig .",

    "quantitatively , the spectra of the generated perturbations depend on the initial state of the oscillators : @xmath67 where the field operators are given in the parametrical zone ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "the factor @xmath69 in the tensor mode expression is due to two polarizations of gravitational waves .",
    "the state @xmath70 is considered to be a ground state , i.e. it corresponds to the minimal level of the initial oscillator excitation .",
    "this is the basic hypothesis of the big bang theory . in case",
    "the adiabatic zone is there , the ground ( vacuum ) state of the elementary oscillators is unique  @xcite .",
    "thus , assuming that the function @xmath71 grows from zero with time ( i.e. the initial adiabatic zone is followed by the parametric one ) and @xmath59 , we obtain a universal and general result for the @xmath14 and @xmath12 spectra : @xmath72 where @xmath73 specifies the moment of creation ( @xmath74 ) . as it is seen from eq .",

    "the sound modulation in the density perturbation spectrum is suppressed by the small factor of the baryon fraction in the entire budget of matter density .",

    "crucial cosmological parameters on which the standard model of the universe is based , and the latter has no viable rivals .",
