    "the nonlinear dynamics and statistical physics of dna denaturation have been widely investigated @xcite .",
    "recent work has attempted to extend mesoscopic scale modeling in order to describe with sufficient accuracy how sequence details determine the statistical and dynamical properties of local fluctuations .",
    "such local fluctuations , known as denaturation bubbles are believed to be instrumental in the _ initiation _ of the transcription process at physiological temperatures .",
    "the possibility of spontaneous , sequence - specific formation of a mid - size bubble has been the subject of considerable research interest - and some debate - @xcite . a related - but nonetheless distinct - question which might be relevant to the _ process _ of transcription concerns the growth of a bubble to much larger sizes .",
    "since this is by definition - at least in an asymptotic sense - a scale - free phenomenon , it is best addressed at the level of the underlying phase transition ; moreover , at least its salient features should be evident within the context of the homogeneous ( polynucleotide ) chain .",
    "it should be recalled that nonlinear lattice dynamics based dna modeling of the peyrard - bishop - dauxois ( pbd @xcite ) type predicts either an ( effectively ) first - order or a ( strict ) second - order phase transition , depending on whether non - linear base - stacking effects are taken into account or not @xcite . in the case of second - order transition , it has been determined that domain walls ( dw ) become entropically stable at the critical temperature @xcite ; recent numerical evidence from monte - carlo simulations @xcite suggests that the average bubble size also becomes critical .",
    "the first - order transition case is slightly more complicated .",
    "entropic effects are not sufficient to enable spontaneous dw formation at the critical temperature .",
    "this appears to rule out dws as agents of thermal denaturation .",
    "bubbles are natural - and in fact have always been - prime suspects for this role .",
    "very recent work @xcite has demonstrated that large bubbles may form in this case as well , and that their probability distribution can not be described by a simple exponential .",
    "detailed data in the vicinity of the critical temperature are not available@xcite",
    ". it is however known from previous work @xcite that most of the physics of nonlinear base - stacking is generated by an effective thermal barrier which modifies the on - site morse - like potential .",
    "the point at which the effects of the thermal barrier become important defines a natural crossover between different types of behavior . as this note",
    "will show in some detail , such a crossover is also present in bubble statistics .",
    "bubbles which extend over a few sites are entirely non - critical ; the onset of criticality is reflected only in the statistics of large bubbles ; the asymptotic properties of the latter are such that the free - energy barrier toward bubble growth is lowered - approaching zero at the transition temperature , whereas the average bubble size always remains finite .",
    "it will be further shown that this dichotomy between large and small bubbles is not restricted to the statistics ; reduced shapes of large and small - size bubbles - which scale uniformly in the absence of nonlinear stacking interactions - reveal distinct differences when nonlinear stacking is included .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :",
    "section ii includes model definitions , notation and general properties of bubbles .",
    "section iii presents numerical results on bubble statistics based on direct matrix multiplication .",
    "section iv formulates an alternative procedure based on an associated eigenvalue problem which provides emphasis on asymptotic properties .",
    "section v discusses bubbles shapes .",
    "the final section includes a brief summary and discussion of some key points .",
    "the pbd model assumes a potential energy of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a transverse coordinate representing the separation of the two bases at the @xmath2th site , @xmath3(y - y')^2\\ ] ] is an anharmonic elastic term which models the nonlinear base - stacking interaction and @xmath4 is an on - site morse potential describing the combined effects of hydrogen - bonding , stacking and solvent .",
    "i will use the dimensionless parameter values @xmath5 , @xmath6 and , unless otherwise stated , @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , i will assume that the system is subjected to periodic boundary conditions .",
    "thermodynamics is governed by the properties of the transfer integral ( ti ) equation @xmath8 with @xmath9/t}$ ] and @xmath10 the dimensionless temperature . in particular , details of a possible phase transition depend on the type of singularity ( if any ) which the spectral gap @xmath11 might exhibit near a critical temperature @xmath12 . since the spectral gap is equal to the singular part of the thermodynamic free energy per site @xcite , a linearly vanishing gap as @xmath13 corresponds to a first order transition , a quadratically vanishing gap to a second order transition etc .",
    "the @xmath14th base pair is assumed to be unbound if @xmath15 ; it is in a bound state if @xmath16 ; i choose @xmath17 , the inflexion point of the morse potential .",
    "the choice is of course somewhat arbitrary , but it should not influence fundamental asymptotic results . a bubble of length @xmath14 is a sequence of @xmath14 successive unbound sites preceded and followed , respectively , by a single bound site .",
    "it is present in the infinite system ( assumed subjected to periodic boundary conditions ) with a probability @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the full configurational partition function , dominated by the highest eigenvalue @xmath20 , @xmath21 denotes the ti eigenstate corresponding to @xmath20 , and @xmath22 .      by definition ,",
    "the sum of all @xmath23 s expresses the probability that the site which precedes the bubble has a bound base pair , i.e. @xmath24 moreover , the sum @xmath25 expresses the fraction of sites with unbound base pairs . as a consequence ,",
