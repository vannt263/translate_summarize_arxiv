    "resolved images of debris disks enable studies of the properties and dynamics of grains that compose the debris in extrasolar planetary systems .",
    "they also provide opportunities for indirectly detecting planets via their dynamical effects on the distribution of the dust .",
    "observing light scattered by debris disks is difficult because the disks have small optical depths ( @xmath7 ) and their host stars are bright .",
    "dozens of optically thick disks around young stars have been imaged in scattered light , but only 16 debris disks have been resolved in this manner ( table  [ 16disks ] ) .",

    "thus , few examples of the circumstellar environments of low - mass stars in the late stages of planet formation are known .",
    "the nearby star hd  92945 ( k1  v , @xmath9 , distance = @xmath10  pc ; @xcite ) was first identified by @xcite as a candidate for attendant circumstellar dust based on its 60  flux measured by the _ infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) _ , which significantly exceeds the expected photospheric flux at that wavelength .",
    "mid - infrared and submillimeter images of hd  92945 from the _ spitzer space telescope _ and the caltech submillimeter observatory also reveal excess fluxes at 70  and 350  that , along with the _ iras _ measurement , are consistent with an optically thin disk of blackbody grains having an inner radius of 1523  au , an equilibrium temperature of 4046  k , and a fractional infrared luminosity of @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the bolometric luminosity of the star @xcite .",

    "these coronagraphic images from the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ provide only the second opportunity to study a debris disk around a k dwarf at visible wavelengths .",
    "we also present new mid - infrared photometry and spectra of the disk obtained from the _ spitzer space telescope_. together , these _ hst _ and _ spitzer _ observations allow us to constrain the optical properties , sizes , and spatial distribution of the dust grains within the disk .",
    "we use these constraints to revise the estimates of the disk s fractional infrared luminosity and mass previously reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "finally , we discuss the morphology of the disk in the context of other spatially resolved debris disks and current models of dust production and dynamics during the late stages of planet formation .",
    "our _ hst _ and _ spitzer _ observations are presented jointly as the result of agreements between the _ hst _ advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) investigation definition team ( idt ) , the multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips ) instrument team , and the investigators associated with _ spitzer _",

    "the inclusion of hd  92945 in the acs idt s dedicated effort to discover and characterize nearby debris disks was informed by an early 70  mips detection of cold circumstellar dust around the star @xcite .",
    "the mips detection confirmed the previous _ iras _ measurement and established an acceptible likelihood of detection by acs based on previous successful imaging of the debris disk around hd  107146 @xcite .",
    "the acs observations of hd  92945 were performed as part of _ hst _ guaranteed time observer ( gto ) program 10330 , which followed the idt s standard strategy of first obtaining coronagraphic images through a single broadband filter to assess the presence of a debris disk and later obtaining multiband images of the disk , if warranted .",
    "the first images of hd  92945 were obtained on ut  2004 december  1 using the high resolution channel ( hrc ) of acs @xcite .",
    "the hrc has a @xmath17-pixel ccd detector whose pixels subtend an area of 0028  @xmath18  0025 , providing a @xmath19 field of view ( fov ) .",
    "hd  92945 was acquired in the standard `` peak - up '' mode with the coronagraph assembly deployed in the focal plane of the aberrated beam .",
    "the star was then positioned behind the small ( 09 radius ) occulting spot located approximately at the center of the fov .",
    "two successive coronagraphic exposures of 1100  s were recorded using the f606w ( broad @xmath0 ) filter .",
    "two 0.1  s and two 35  s direct ( i.e. , non - coronagraphic ) exposures of hd  92945 were also recorded for the purposes of photometric calibration and detection of any bright circumstellar material obscured by the occulting spot .",
    "the 0.1  s exposures were digitized using an analog - to - digital ( a / d ) gain of @xmath20  dn@xmath21 to allow unsaturated images of the unocculted star ; the other images were recorded with an a / d gain of @xmath22  dn@xmath21 for better sampling of faint sources .",
    "all images were recorded within one _ hst _ orbit .",
    "a similar set of f606w images of hd  100623 ( k0  v , @xmath23 , @xmath24  pc ; @xcite ) was recorded during the orbit immediately following the observation of hd  92945 .",
    "these images provide references for the instrumental point - spread functions ( psfs ) of a nearby star with colors similar to hd  92945 but having no known circumstellar dust @xcite .",

    "multiple coronagraphic exposures totalling 4870  s and 7600  s were recorded through the f606w and f814w ( broad  @xmath1 ) filters , respectively , over 5 consecutive _ hst _ orbits .",
    "one direct exposure of 0.1  s was also recorded through each filter for photometric calibration .",

    "likewise , coronagraphic exposures of hd  100623 totalling 2178  s and 2412  s were recorded through f606w and f814w , respectively , over 2 consecutive orbits immediately following the observation of hd  92945 .",
    "one 10  s coronagraphic exposure of hd  100623 was recorded through each filter to ensure unsaturated imaging of the psf along the perimeter of the occulting spot .",
    "one direct exposure of 0.1  s was also recorded through each filter for photometric purposes .",
    "the initial stages of image reduction ( i.e. , subtraction of bias and dark frames and division by a direct or coronagraphic flat field ) were performed by the acs image calibration pipeline at the space telescope science institute ( stsci ; @xcite ) .",
    "we averaged the images recorded with the same combinations of filter , exposure time , and roll angle after interpolating over permanent bad pixels and rejecting transient artifacts identified as statistical outliers .",
    "we then normalized the averaged images to unit exposure time .",
    "we replaced saturated pixels in the long - exposure images of hd  100623 with unsaturated pixels at corresponding locations in the 10  s images . throughout this process",
    ", we tracked the uncertainties associated with each image pixel .",
    "in this manner , we created cosmetically clean , high - contrast images and meaningful error maps for each combination of star , filter , and roll angle .",

    "the corresponding first - epoch f606w and second - epoch f814w images are qualitatively similar to those shown in figure  [ f606w ] .      to examine the scattered - light component of the dust around hd  92945 , we removed from each image the overwhelming light from the occulted star s psf . by observing hd  92945 and hd  100623 in consecutive",
    "_ hst _ orbits , we limited the differences between the psfs of the two stars that would otherwise be caused by inconsistent deployment of the coronagraph assembly , gradual migration of the occulting spot , or changes in _ hst s _ thermally driven focus cycles ( commonly called  breathing  ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we measured the positions of the stars behind the occulting spot using the central peaks of the reduced coronagraphic psfs ( figure  [ f606w ] ) that resulted from the reimaging of incompletely occulted , spherically aberrated starlight by acs s corrective optics @xcite .",
    "the positions of the two stars differed by @xmath250.5  pixel ( @xmath260080013 ) .",
    "similar offsets between two coronagraphic images of the same star cause @xmath27% variations in the surface brightness profiles of the occulted psfs over most of the hrc s fov @xcite . for different stars ,",
    "this alignment error may be compounded by differences between the stars colors and brightnesses .",
    "optimal subtraction of the coronagraphic psf requires accurate normalization and registration of the filter images of the reference star hd  100623 with the corresponding images of hd  92945 .",
    "we used the 0.1  s direct f606w and f814w images and conventional aperture photometry to measure the relative brightnesses of each star in each bandpass .",
    "the first - epoch f606w images of hd  100623 were slightly saturated , but the flux - conserving a / d gain of 4@xmath28  dn@xmath21 @xcite and a large ( 05 radius ) aperture permitted accurate measurement of the integrated flux .",
    "we computed flux ratios , @xmath29 , of 5.00 and 4.83 for f606w and f814w , respectively .",
    "we divided the images of hd  100623 by these ratios to bring the integrated brightnesses of the reference psfs into conformity with those of hd  92945 .",
    "we aligned the normalized images of hd  100623 with the corresponding images of hd  92945 using an interactive routine that permits orthogonal shifts of an image with subpixel resolution and cubic convolution interpolation .",
    "the shift intervals and normalization factors ( i.e. , @xmath29 ) were progressively refined throughout the iterative process .",
    "we assessed the quality of the normalization and registration by visually inspecting the difference image created after each shift or normalization adjustment .",
    "convergence was reached when the subtraction residuals were visibly minimized and refinements of the shift interval or normalization factor had inconsequential effects ( e.g. , bottom panel of figure  [ f606w ] ) .",
    "based on these qualitative assessments , we estimate that the uncertainty of the registration along each axis is @xmath30  pixel and the uncertainty of @xmath29 in each bandpass is @xmath31% .    after subtracting the coronagraphic psfs from each image of hd  92945",
    ", we transformed the images to correct the pronounced geometric distortion across the hrc s image plane .",
    "in doing so , we used the coefficients of the biquartic - polynomial distortion map provided by stsci @xcite and cubic convolution interpolation to conserve the imaged flux .",
    "this correction yields a rectified pixel scale of 0025  @xmath18  0025 . we then combined the first- and second - epoch f606w images by rotating the former images counterclockwise by 157 , aligning the images according to the previously measured stellar centroids , and averaging the images after rejecting pixels that exceeded their local @xmath32 values .",
    "regions shaded by the hrc s occulting bar and large occulting spot were excluded from the average , as were regions corrupted by incomplete subtraction of the linear psf artifact seen in figure  [ f606w ] .",
    "( because the orientations of the first- and second - epoch f606w images differed by 157 , the regions obscured by the occulters and the linear artifact at one epoch were unobscured at the other epoch . )",
    "again , we tracked the uncertainties associated with each stage of image processing to maintain a meaningful map of random pixel errors .",
    "we combined in quadrature the final random - error maps with estimates of the systematic errors caused by uncertainties in the normalization and registration of the reference psfs .",
    "the systematic - error maps represent the convolved differences between the optimal psf - subtracted image of hd  92945 and three nonoptimal ones generated by purposefully misaligning ( along each axis ) or misscaling the images of hd  100623 by amounts equal to our estimated uncertainties in psf registration and @xmath29 .",
    "the total systematic errors are 15 times larger than the random errors within @xmath275 of hd  92945 , but they diminish to 225% of the random errors beyond @xmath33@xmath34 from the star .",
    "we refer to the combined maps of random and systematic errors as total - error maps .",
    "note that these maps exclude systematic errors caused by changes in _",
    "hst s _ focus between the observations of hd  92945 and hd  100623 or by small differences in the stars colors , which affect the spatial and spectral distributions of light within the psfs . @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , without precise knowledge of _ hst s _ thermally varying optical configuration or the stars spectra , these systematic errors can not be accurately predicted or assessed .",
    "figure  [ psfsub ] shows the psf - subtracted and distortion - corrected images of hd  92945 in f606w and f814w .",
    "each image has been divided by the measured brightness of the star in the respective bandpass .",
    "the alternating light and dark bands around the occulting spot reflect imperfect psf subtraction caused by the slightly mismatched centroids of hd  92945 and hd  100623 @xcite .",
    "these subtraction residuals preclude accurate photometry of the disk within @xmath350 ( @xmath36  au ) of the star .",
    "likewise , the residual bands extending from the occulting bar in the f814w image are caused by imperfect subtraction of the linear psf artifact seen in figure  [ f606w ] .",
    "( similar residual bands were removed from the f606w image , as described above . )",
    "the images show three distinct structures centered about the star : ( 1 ) a relatively bright but partially obscured elliptical ring extending @xmath35030 from the star , ( 2 ) an elliptical disk of lower but more uniform surface brightness extending beyond the ring and oriented at a position angle ( pa ) of @xmath37 , and ( 3 ) a circular halo of very - low surface brightness encompassing both the ring and disk and extending outward to @xmath38 and @xmath39 in the f606w and f814w images , respectively .",
    "the halo itself is surrounded by a @xmath355-wide ring having slightly lower surface brightness than the residual sky at the edges of the fov .",
    "the faint extended halo and surrounding dark ring are well - known artifacts of the subtraction of two coronagraphic hrc images recorded at different phases of hst s breathing cycle @xcite .",
    "the prominent halo in the f814w image may also reflect incomplete subtraction of red photons ( @xmath40  ) that have diffusely scattered from the ccd substrate back into the ccd @xcite .",
    "some of this red halo may remain if the far - red colors of hd  92945 and hd  100623 differ slightly . to remove the halos from our f606w and f814w images",
    ", we azimuthally subtracted 9th- and 10th - order polynomials fitted to the average radial profiles of the halos measured beyond 30 and 32 from the star , respectively , and within @xmath41  of the minor axis of the elliptical disk .",
    "the accuracy of this subtraction is clearly contingent on the assumptions that the halo is azimuthally symmetric and that any actual circumstellar flux in the fitted region is negliglible .",
    "the halo - subtracted images are shown in figure  [ subhalo ] ; they represent the final stage of our hrc image processing .",
    "following the 24  and 70  mips detections of hd  92945 recorded with the coarse ( default ) image resolution @xcite , we obtained 70  fine - scale ( 524  @xmath18  533 per pixel ) and 160  coarse - scale ( 1596  @xmath18  1804 per pixel ) mips images as part of _ spitzer _ gto program 40679 .",
    "the 70  fine - scale images were recorded on ut 2008  february  16 using two cycles of 10  s exposures and a small field dither pattern located at each of 4 target positions on a square grid with sides of 1622 ( 3.16  pixels ) .",
    "the total effective on - source exposure time was 672  s. the 160  images were obtained on ut 2008  june  22 using one cycle of the small field dither pattern and 10  s exposures at each of 9 target positions with relative offsets of @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( @xmath44 pixels ) along the short axis of the 2@xmath1820 pixel array and with @xmath42 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 offsets along the long axis of the array to provide a large area for background measurement .",
    "for both imaging bandpasses , the observing strategy provided enhanced subpixel sampling for improved psf subtraction and deconvolution .",
    "the 70  and 160  data were processed using the mips data analysis tool ( dat ; @xcite ) version 3.10 , which produces mosaics with rectified pixel sizes of 262 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "no field sources brighter than 3% of hd  92945 s brightness were detected within @xmath48 of the star .",
    "photometry within a 12-pixel square aperture yielded a 70  flux density of @xmath49  mjy after subtraction of the local background , which is consistent with the default - scale measurement of @xcite . after applying a 7% color correction relative to a fiducial rayleigh ",
    "jeans spectrum within the 70  bandpass , we obtain a final 70  flux density of @xmath50  mjy for hd  92945 . we derived a 160  flux density of @xmath51  mjy using a 12-pixel square aperture and an aperture correction of 0.73 derived from an tiny tim / spitzer model psf @xcite . in both bandpasses , the formal error is dominated by the absolute photometric calibration . the near - infrared spectral leak of the mips 160  bandpass is not a concern for hd  92945 , which has a relatively faint @xmath52-band magnitude of 5.7 @xcite .",
    "we observed hd  92945 with the mips sed mode on ut 2005  june  23 .",
    "this mode produces a low - resolution ( @xmath5325 ) spectrum from 55 to 90  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath54 slit was oriented at pa  =  300 , i.e. , @xmath55  from the projected major axis of the disk seen in the acs / hrc images .",
    "ten cycles of 10  s exposures were recorded for a total integration time of 629  s. we obtained a background sed by chopping @xmath56 from the nominal pointing , and we then subtracted the background sed from the target sed .",

    "pixel@xmath21 in the spatial direction and 65 pixels in the spectral direction @xcite .",
    "we smoothed the mosaic in the spectral direction with a 5-pixel boxcar to improve the measured signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) .",
    "we then summed the signal in 5 columns centered on the peak emission along each row of the mosaic and extracted the sed . to calibrate the flux , we scaled a similarly reduced and extracted sed of the spectrophotometric standard star canopus ( spectral type g8  iii ) to a flux density of 3.11  jy at 70  and then corrected for the mips spectral response function by assuming that canopus has a rayleigh - jeans sed at far - infrared wavelengths .",
    "we used a point - source aperture correction , keeping in mind that a secondary correction is needed when fitting a spatially extended disk model to the sed (  [ irmodel ] ) .",
    "we performed irs observations of hd  92945 on ut  2005 may  21 using both short  low ( sl1 : 7.414.5  ; sl2 : 5.28.7  ) and long  low ( ll1 : 19.538.0  ; ll2 : 14.021.3  ) spectroscopic modes @xcite .",

    ", we obtained 6  s exposures at two positions along the slit .",
    "we extracted and summed the spectra from the two slit positions to enhance the s / n and then subtracted the same spectra to establish the observational uncertainty above the normal shot noise and 5% uncertainty in the absolute photometric calibration .",
    "we then spliced the four spectral orders after removing their low - s / n edges , thereby obtaining a total wavelength range of 5.334  .",
    "our measured flux density of 42  mjy at 24  matches very well the mips 24  value reported by @xcite .",

    "the fully processed acs / hrc images ( figure  [ subhalo ] ) suggest that hd  92945 is surrounded by an azimuthally symmetric disk of dust that is moderately inclined with respect to the line of sight and sharply confined to the region within @xmath581 ( @xmath59  au ) of the star .",
    "any obvious azimuthal variations can be attributed either to geometric projection or to psf - subtraction residuals .",
    "such axisymmetry is rare within the present group of debris disks resolved in scattered light ( table  [ 16disks ] ) , which typically display asymmetries associated with perturbations from embedded planets or nearby stars ( e.g. , @xmath14  pic and hd  141569a ; @xcite ) , interaction with the interstellar medium ( e.g. , hd  61005 ; @xcite ) , and/or enhanced forward scattering by micron - sized dust grains ( e.g. , hd  15745 ; @xcite ) .",

    "figures  [ deproj]_a _ and [ deproj]_b _ are false - color reproductions of our f606w image shown in figure  [ subhalo ] before and after rotating the disk by @xmath95  about its projected major axis so that the disk appears circular and coplanar with the sky . figures  [ deproj]_c _ and [ deproj]_d _ show with different color tables and smoothing factors the deprojected image after multiplying by @xmath94 to compensate for the geometric dilution of incident starlight with angular distance from the star .",
    "these images represent the surface brightness of the dust scaled by an assumed constant value @xmath96 .",
    "our scaled surface - density map reveals concentrations of grains not only in the previously described inner ring , but also along the outer edge of the disk defined by the sharp decline in the radial surface brightness profile at @xmath97 or 110  au (  [ sbp ] ) .",
    "these overdensities are apparent on both the eastern and western sides of the disk ; they appear to be concentric rings of dust centered on the star .",
    "the outer ring appears less azimuthally uniform on the eastern side , which may indicate nonisotropic scattering but more likely reflects lower s / n in the southeastern region of the image . if the major axis of the projected disk is properly identified and the dust distribution is axisymmetric , then any evidence of forward scattering should be symmetric about the projected minor axis of the disk and not concentrated in its southeastern quadrant .      to obtain more quantitative constraints on the density distribution and scattering properties of the circumstellar dust , we applied the three - dimensional scattering model and nonlinear least - squares fitting code previously used to characterize the disk around au  mic @xcite . using the azimuthally averaged radial profile from figure  [ deproj]_c _ as a guide , the model simultaneously computes the scattering phase function , radial density profile , and inclination of the disk that best fits the observed scattered - light image .",
    "the model image also provides a better estimate of the ratio of integrated reflected light from the disk and emitted star light than can be obtained from coronagraphic images that have regions with large psf - subtraction residuals .",
    "consequently , we modeled only our f606w image of the disk , which has better overall s / n and psf subtraction than the f814w image .    the f606w radial density profile used to guide the model is represented by the solid curve in figure  [ sdprof ] .",
    "because the model code is designed to produce best - fitting radial density profiles as a series of contiguous power - law functions , we allowed the code to fit up to 18 distinct power - law segments to approximate the unusually complex f606w profile of hd  92945 .",
    "these 18 segments were established for computational convenience ; they are not associated with any physical attributes of the disk itself .",
    "we set the inner radius of the model profile at 41  au , as there appears to be a true clearing in the f606w image despite the large psf - subtraction residuals near the star .",
    "( the disk s surface brightness inside 41  au certainly does not increase in a manner consistent with the steep increase associated with the outer edge of the inner ring . )",
    "we also placed an outer limit of 150  au on the model profile , in conformity with the largest distance at which the disk is confidently seen in our f606w image .    because the plane of hd  92945 s disk is inclined @xmath98  from the line of sight ( i.e. , @xmath98  from an `` edge - on '' presentation ) , our scattering model can not constrain the vertical distribution of the dust as a function of radial distance from the star .",
    "we can only derive a radial density distribution integrated along lines of sight across the disk .",
    "nevertheless , if we assume that the disk is vertically thin relative to its radial extent ( as in the case of au  mic , whose disk is viewed edge - on ) , the models show that the vertical density profile does not strongly affect the appearance of a moderately inclined disk in scattered light .",
    "we therefore adopted _ a priori _ for hd  92945 a lorentzian vertical density profile similar to those observed in the edge - on disks around au  mic @xcite and @xmath14  pic @xcite .",
    "we also assumed a flat disk with a fixed scale height @xmath99 of either 0.5  au or 3.0  au , which bracket the scale heights observed for au  mic s disk within @xmath100  au of the star @xcite .",
    "having fixed the disk s inner and outer radii , thickness , and vertical density profile , we allowed our code to determine the radial density profile , intensity normalization , scattering phase function ( as described by the asymmetry parameter @xmath101 ; @xcite ) , and disk inclination that best fits the observed f606w image of hd  92945 .",

    "the strongest constraint on @xmath111 is provided by the weak infrared excess seen in the irs spectrum longward of 30  .",

    "although these results are consistent with the observed upper limit of the 70  source size , we had to steepen the grain - size distribution to @xmath121 to fit the 70  and 160  photometry simultaneously .",
    "even with this adjustment , the initial model overestimated the 350  flux density by a factor of 1.7 .    to address this problem",
    ", we postulated that the large grains are not evenly distributed throughout the observed disk but are confined to the inner ring at 4163  au .",
    "we also surmised that the outer disk ( 63150  au ) consists of smaller particles that have been ejected from the inner ring by some combination of collisions , stellar wind , radiation pressure , and/or gravitational scattering by planetary bodies .",
    "similar structures have been inferred for the disks surrounding au  mic and @xmath14  pic @xcite , hd  61005 @xcite , fomalhaut @xcite , and vega @xcite .",
    "we thus adopted a two - component dust model for hd  92945 s disk .",
    "we maintained the grain - size distribution and surface - density profile derived from the scattered - light images , but assumed that @xmath122   within the ring and @xmath123  elsewhere in the disk .",
    "this change reduced the total number of large grains in the disk and brought the model into agreement with the 350  measurement .    while this two - component model provides a good fit to the mips and irs data ,",
    "it is inconsistent with the observed surface brightness of the disk in scattered light .",
    "the average albedo of the dust is    @xmath124    where @xmath125 and @xmath126 are the fractions of bolometric stellar flux that are scattered and emitted by the dust , respectively .",

    "as noted before for hd  207129 s disk @xcite , simple mie grains are inconsistent with the combined visible and far - infrared observations of the disk surrounding hd  92945 .",

    "figure  [ sedmodel ] shows our final model , which best matches the observed sed and surface brightness of the disk if the sources of the scattered and emitted light are cospatial .",
    "the component seds show that the outer disk is the dominant contributor to the observed 70 , 160 , and 350  emission and that the larger grains in the inner ring should become the dominant emitters longward of @xmath134  .",
    "the constraints placed on @xmath135 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 by our final model are unique for the assumed emissive properties of compact astrosilicate grains , but other constraints may be obtained for different assumptions about these properties .",
    "supplemental photometry at 450 and 850  would be a useful check of our values of @xmath112 in both the inner ring and outer disk .",
    "we can however exclude blackbody grains from consideration , as they would be too cold at the radii delimited by the scattered - light images to produce the observed sed . moreover , the disk is too extensive to be characterized by a single blackbody temperature .",
    "any resemblance of our sed model longward of 160  ( figure  [ sedmodel ] ) to the rayleigh ",
    "jeans tail of a single planck distribution is coincidental .",
    "combining our final values of @xmath135 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 for each dust component with the surface - density profile from our scattered - light model , we obtain an integrated dust mass of @xmath136  g ( @xmath5 ) for compact grains of pure astronomical silicate . although @xmath112 is 18 times larger in the inner ring than the outer disk , the inner ring is 4 times less massive than the outer disk .",
    "this disparity is caused by the relatively large surface area of the outer disk and the steeply declining grain - size distribution throughout both the inner ring and outer disk .",
    "our estimated mass of @xmath137  g for grains smaller than 900  in the inner ring is @xmath27% of the computed mass of fomalhaut s ring @xcite ,  g for fomalhaut s ring assuming albedos of 0.10.05 , which conform to our measured value of @xmath138 for hd  92945 . for the extreme case of @xmath139 , @xcite computed a mass of @xmath140  g , which is comparable with our estimate for hd  92945 s inner ring . ] and @xmath141% of the predicted mass of the ring around hr  4796a @xcite .",
    "our integrated dust mass is @xmath100 times larger than the value obtained by @xcite from early mips 24 and 70   photometry of hd  92945 .",

    "none of these assumptions is upheld by our scattered - light images and thermal model .",
    "for comparative purposes , we applied the same formula used by @xcite to compute the dust mass and obtained a value that is only 20% larger than the one derived from our observed surface - density profile .",
    "therefore , our revised dust mass of @xmath5 supersedes those previously reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the dust s neutral color and negligible emission at 24  indicate that the collisional cascade is suppressed below radii of several microns , which is an order of magnitude larger than @xmath115 .",
    "this truncation of the grain - size distribution is counterintuitive for a star of subsolar mass and luminosity , especially as the dust s isotropic scattering and low albedo indicate a large population of submicron - sized grains @xcite .",
    "this contradiction suggests that our initial assumptions about the location , composition and/or size distribution of the thermally emitting dust should be reviewed .",
    "+      our invocation of two dust components with common @xmath111 but different @xmath112 to explain the disk s neutral color and infrared sed is based on the assumption that the dust grains responsible for the scattered light and the infrared excess are cospatial .",
    "although the inner ring seen in our coronagraphic f606w image suggests that the dust is created in a coincident planetesimal belt , the presence of dust closer to the star can not be ruled out by our coronagraphic images alone .",
    "if such dust is present and in lte with the stellar radiation field , it must have @xmath144  ( our derived value for the inner ring ) or a large albedo to avoid a detectable 24  excess .",
    "the former option worsens the discrepancy between the large @xmath111 needed to fit the infrared sed and the small @xmath115 for a young k dwarf like hd  92945 .",
    "the latter option counterintuitively suggests that conditions favorable for icy grains increase within 40  au of the star rather than beyond the expected snow line at @xmath35  au @xcite .",
    "thus , neither option favors the presence of much dust between the star and the inner ring .",
    "conversely , if much dust exists beyond the apparent outer limit of the scattered - light disk ( @xmath145 or 110  au ) , then its albedo must be nearly zero to conform with the observed surface brightness profiles ( figure  [ sbavg ] )",
    ". moreover , @xmath135 must be much steeper than the traditional @xmath146 power law @xcite to account for both the observed sed longward of 160  and the unresolved 70  image of the disk .",
    "such a small albedo again counters the expected formation of icy mantles beyond the snow line , and it implies a corresponding increase in emissivity for grains larger than @xmath147  .",
    "such small grains would be efficiently expelled from the disk by radiation pressure .",
    "collectively , these arguments support our assumption that all the thermally emitting dust is confined within the angular limits of the visible scattered light seen figure  [ subhalo ] .",
    "recent theoretical studies of other debris disks have frequently invoked highly porous aggregate grains to explain the observed scattered light and/or thermal emission from the dust @xcite .",
    "models of the optical properties of porous grains have yielded diverse and sometimes contradictory results , so we defer a detailed model of hd  92945 s disk using porous aggregate grains to other investigations . for now , we qualitatively assess the substitution of such grains for the compact grains in our scattered - light and thermal models .",
    "@xcite showed that the henyey ",
    "greenstein scattering asymmetry parameter , @xmath101 , of moderately porous grains increases by factors of 11.25 over that of compact grains for @xmath1482.5  and @xmath0-band wavelengths .",
    "@xcite showed that the degree of porosity has little effect on the scattering phase functions of grains at wavelengths @xmath149 .",
    "consequently , neither compact nor porous micron - sized grains account for the isotropic scattering observed from hd  92945 s disk .",
    "the effect of porosity on the albedo is unclear , however , as @xcite and @xcite oppositely predict that highly porous grains have lower and higher albedos , respectively , than compact grains of similar composition .",

    "@xcite confirmed this result and emphasized that the decreasing @xmath14 was limited to ultraviolet and visible wavelengths .",
    "@xcite also showed that @xmath14 increases with porosity for absorptive grains ( e.g. , magnetite and graphite ) with @xmath151  , and it becomes nearly independent of grain size at the highest porosities . on the other hand , dielectric grains ( e.g. astronomical silicate ) with @xmath152  experience decreasing @xmath14 as porosity increases .",
    "@xcite determined that @xmath14 increases rapidly with increasing porosity for both graphite and silicate grains with @xmath153  .",
    "collectively , these results indicate that high porosity of grains in hd  92945 s disk does not explain the @xmath154  obtained from our silicate - based thermal model .",
    "however , high porosity may be responsible for such a large value of @xmath111 if the dust is mostly composed of more absorptive materials like graphite .",
    "our need to steepen hd  92945 s grain - size distribution from the traditional @xmath146 representation @xcite to reproduce the observed sed is consistent with thermal models of the disks around au  mic @xcite and hd  207129 @xcite , which , like our model , employ compact spherical grains .",

    "recent models of collisional cascades in the presence of radiation pressure have shown that the rapid loss of grains with @xmath156 creates a wave in the size distribution of the remaining grains @xcite , so a single power - law representation may be inappropriate regardless of porosity or composition .",
    "@xcite noted that the wave becomes sufficiently damped for @xmath157 that the size distribution can be approximated by @xmath4 , which matches our best - fitting thermal model of hd  92945 .",
    "this agreement is surprising because our model suggests that most grains in the outer disk , which is the dominant contributor to the observed sed at @xmath158  ( figure  [ sedmodel ] ) , are smaller than @xmath159  and should therefore lie in the wavy part of the distribution .",
    "our result may indicate that the wave is actually smaller and/or less extensive than predicted by @xcite and that the size distribution follows the @xmath4 power law for grains as small as @xmath160 ( a.  gspr , personal communication ) .",
    "@xcite noted that the wavy structure in the size distribution is more pronounced for materials that are prone to cratering rather than catastrophic fragmentation .",
    "if so , then softer and more absorptive grains like graphite may not easily account for both the large @xmath154  (  5.1.2 ) and the monotonic @xmath4 size distribution obtained from our thermal model .",
    "of course , our model is based on the common _ a priori _ assumption of a power - law distribution without any regard to goodness - of - fit , so we can not discount any possible compositions of the dust without an exhaustive investigation of alternative size distributions .",
    "+      @xcite studied the tangential and radial contributions of corpuscular stellar wind to the removal of grains in the debris disks of late - type dwarfs .",

    "@xcite confirmed that the collisional lifetime of grains in the birth ring is @xmath163 times smaller than the timescale for removal by corpuscular drag , so stellar wind does not presently contribute to the evolution of au  mic s disk .",

    "for example , @xcite initially considered a @xmath176 star with a quiescent disk having a surface - density profile @xmath177 at @xmath178150  au , which after several hundred myr remains smoothly asymptotic at large radii except when a ring , gap , or shadow passes through the region .",

    "the former possibility does not apply to hd  92945 because its disk has very little mass (  [ dustmass ] ) and is optically thin , but the latter one may be relevant to both the morphology and large @xmath111 of the disk if it is dynamically cold .",
    "@xcite determined that the low eccentricities of bodies in dynamically cold disks not only reduce the production of small grains from destructive collisions of larger bodies , but also increase the destruction of small grains because the grains are more likely to collide with larger bodies as they are radiatively expelled from the disk .",
    "although the potential link between a cold disk and large @xmath111 is intriguing , the low eccentricities needed for such a condition conflict with the high eccentricities of grains in the outer disk ( caused perhaps by repeated encounters with a migrating planet ) that likely produce the double - peaked surface - density profiles observed for hd  92945 ( figure  [ sdprof ] ) and modeled by @xcite .      the intermediate inclination of hd  92945 s disk makes our scattered - light model (  [ jekmodel ] ) insensitive to the disk s vertical thickness and its possible radial dependence",
    "we are therefore unable to constrain the scale height of the disk , which is an indicator of its dynamical temperature and a means for assessing the relevance of the dynamical models just described .",
    "moreover , the disk s inclination inhibits the detection of small - scale clumps or perturbations like those seen in the disks of au  mic @xcite and @xmath14  pic @xcite , which are viewed along their edges through extensive columns of dust .",
    "consequently , we are unable to ascribe the apparent axisymmetry of the dust to the dominance of radiation pressure in a quiescent disk , a temporary lull in the stochastic collisions of planetesimals , or some other process",
    ". resolved images of the disk at far - infrared or submillimeter wavelengths would allow us to determine whether the axisymmetry persists over a large range of particle sizes and whether resonant trapping of planetesimals dust by a migrating planet is indeed a viable explanation for the observed surface density of the disk @xcite .",
    "our acs / hrc coronagraphic images of hd  92945 reveal an inclined axisymmetric debris disk comprising an inner ring @xmath186030 ( 4365  au ) from the star and a faint outer disk with average f606w ( broad @xmath0 ) and f814w ( broad @xmath1 ) surface brightness profiles declining as @xmath187 for @xmath188051 ( 65110  au ) and @xmath189 for @xmath72167 ( 110145  au ) .",
    "the sharp break in the profiles at 110  au suggests that the disk is truncated at that distance .",
    "the observed relative surface - density profile is peaked at both the inner ring and the outer edge of the disk .",
    "this morphology is unusual among the 15 other disks that have been spatially resolved in scattered light , which typically exhibit either solitary rings with sharp edges ( e.g. , hr  4796a and fomalhaut ) or asymmetric nebulosity with indefinite outer limits ( e.g. , @xmath14  pic and hd  61005 ) .",
    "only hd  181327 has an axisymmetric ring and extended nebulosity somewhat akin to hd  92945 s disk , but its nebulosity is asymmetric and has a steep ( but not truncated ) surface brightness profile within @xmath190  au @xcite .    the dust in hd  92945 s outer disk scatters neutrally and isotropically in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands .",
    "these characteristics contradict current optical models of compact and porous grains , which predict that grains larger than a few microns are neutral scatterers and submicron - sized grains are isotropic scatterers at these wavelengths .",
    "the disk s anomalously low @xmath0-band albedo ( @xmath6% ) also suggests a large population of submicron - sized grains .",
    "if grains smaller than a few microns are absent , then stellar radiation pressure may be the cause only if the dust is composed of highly absorptive materials like graphite .",
    "optical models of compact silicate grains suggest a maximum blow - out size of @xmath191  , and this size decreases as porosity increases @xcite .",
    "our _ spitzer _ mips and irs measurements reveal no significant infrared excess from hd  92945 s disk shortward of 30  , and they constrain the width of the 70  source to @xmath2  au . assuming that the dust comprises compact grains of astronomical silicate confined to the disk imaged with acs , we modeled the 24350  emission with a grain - size distribution @xmath121 and @xmath3  throughout the disk , but with @xmath118  and 50  in the inner ring and outer disk , respectively . combining these thermal constraints with the albedo and surface - density profile obtained from our acs images , we obtain an integrated dust mass of @xmath5 .    conflicting indicators of minimum grain size are not unique to hd  92945 .",
    "@xcite reported that the narrow ring around the g0  v star hd  207129 exhibits both isotropic scattering and very low albedo ( @xmath58% ) , but its far - infrared sed is adequately modeled with silicate grains with @xmath192  and @xmath193 . as in the case of hd  92945 , this value of @xmath111 greatly exceeds the radiative blow - out size for the host star , and @xmath135 is significantly steeper than the traditional @xmath146 representation for a steady - state collisional cascade @xcite .",
    "the results for hd  92945 and hd  207129 are based on reliable and well - calibrated _ hst _ and _ spitzer _ data , so it appears that the conflicting indicators stem from an incomplete understanding of the composition and optical properties of compact and porous grains around low - mass stars .",
    "current grain models indicate that the scattering asymmetry parameter and albedo are insufficiently sensitive to composition and porosity to account for our observational results , but some contradictory trends demand that caution be exercised when applying the models to observational data .",
    "as demonstrated by @xcite for au  mic , polarimetric imaging of hd  92945 s disk may provide definitive constraints on the sizes and porosity of the grains and thus avoid some ambiguities of the grain models .",
    "hd  92945 s disk morphology is remarkably like those predicted from dynamical models of dust produced from collisions of planetesimals perturbed by coalescing or migrating planets .",
    "the planet - resonance model of @xcite is particularly intriguing because it yields , for a plausible range of grain sizes , a double - peaked surface density profile that resembles the observed profile of hd  92945 s disk .",
    "furthermore , this model predicts differences between the size distributions of grains that remain in the resonance in which they were created and those that leave the resonance on bound , axisymmetric orbits because of radiation pressure",
    ". such spatial segregation by grain size may be relevant to our thermal model of hd  92945 s infrared sed , which requires two components of dust distinguished by values of @xmath112 that are 18 times larger in the inner ring than in the outer disk in order to match the observed 70 , 160 , and 350  fluxes .    as @xcite has advocated and as existing multiband images of the disks around @xmath14  pic , vega , and fomalhaut have shown , resolved images over a broad spectral range are needed to constrain the composition and location of the hd  92945 s dust , as well as the mechanism(s ) responsible for the disk s morphology at each wavelength .",
    "the high - resolution infrared and millimeter imaging capabilities of the _ herschel _ observatory and the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) are well suited for determining the location or distribution of the unresolved thermal emission detected with _",
    "spitzer_. if the planet - resonance model of @xcite applies to hd  92945 , then _ herschel _ and alma images should reveal increasing concentrations of resonant dust as the imaging wavelength increases . constraining the location of the resonances",
    "would in turn constrain the mass and location of a putative migrating planet , which , at an age of @xmath16  myr and possible mass of only a few @xmath194 (  [ modcomp ] ) , may not be directly detected with a high - resolution , near - infrared coronagraph such as that used to image the younger giant planet @xmath14  pic  b @xcite .",
    "given the demise of the acs / hrc and the uncertain future of nicmos , the next likely opportunity for imaging hd  92945 s disk in scattered light will follow the launch of the _ james webb space telescope .",
    "_ _ jwst s _ near - infrared camera and tunable filter imager will provide coronagraphic imaging from 1.55.0  , which together with our acs images will permit an assessment of the chromatic dependence of the albedo , color , and scattering asymmetry of the dust over nearly a decade of wavelengths .",
    "coronagraphic imaging with _",
    "jwst s _ mid - infrared instrument ( miri ) will probably be less fruitful , as _",
    "observations have shown no significant excess flux from dust shortward of 30  .",
    "however , miri will be useful for assessing the presence and characteristics of an infant planetary system .",
    "that said , more immediately accessible 450 and 850  ground - based photometry would help to constrain the submillimeter end of hd  92945 s sed and , consequently , the distribution and size limits of grains in the inner ring and outer disk . + we gratefully acknowledge paul smith from the university of arizona for his assistance with mips sed data processing .",
    "we also thank glenn schneider and collaborators for sharing the results of their nicmos observations of hd  92945 prior to publication .",
