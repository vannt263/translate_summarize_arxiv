    "the magnetic melvin universe ( more appropriately the bonnor - melvin universe ) @xcite is sourced by a beam of magnetic field parallel to the @xmath2-axis in the weyl coordinates \\{@xmath3}. the metric depends only on the radial coordinate @xmath4 which makes a typical case of cylindrical symmetry .",
    "it is a regular , non - black hole solution of the einstein - maxwell equations .",
    "behaviour of the magnetic field is @xmath5 ( for @xmath6 ) and @xmath7 ( for @xmath8 ) . at radial infinity",
    "the magnetic field vanishes but spacetime is not flat . on the symmetry axis ( @xmath9 ) the magnetic field vanishes ; since the behaviour is same for @xmath10 the melvin spacetime is not asymptotically flat also for @xmath11",
    ". the magnetic field can be assumed strong enough to warp spacetime to the extent that it produces possible wormholes .",
    "strong magnetic fields are available in magnetars ( i.e. @xmath12 while our earth s magnetic field is @xmath13 ) , pulsars and other objects .",
    "since creation of strong magnetic fields can be at our disposal in a laboratory - at least in very short time intervals - it is natural to raise the question whether wormholes can be produced in a magnetized superconducting environment .",
    "_ from this reasoning we aim to construct a thin - shell wormhole ( tsw ) in a magnetic melvin universe . _",
    "the method is an art of spacetime tailoring , i.e. cutting and pasting at a throat region under well - defined mathematical junction conditions .",
    "some related papers can be found in @xcite for spherically symmetric bulk and in @xcite for cylindrically symmetric .",
    "the tsw  is threaded by exotic matter which is taken for granted , and our principal aim is to search for the stability criteria for such a wormhole .",
    "two cylindrically symmetric melvin universes are glued at a hypersurface radius @xmath14constant , which is endowed with surface energy - momentum to provide necessary support against the gravitational collapse .",
    "it turns out that in the melvin spacetime the radial flare - out condition , i.e. @xmath15 is satisfied for a restricted radial distance , which makes a small scale wormhole .",
    "specifically , this amounts to a throat radius @xmath16 so that for high magnetic fields the throat radius can be made arbitrarily small .",
    "this can be dubbed as a microscopic wormhole .",
    "as stated recently such small wormholes may host the quantum einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) pair @xcite .",
    "the throat is linearly perturbed in the radial distance and the resulting perturbation equation is obtained .",
    "the problem is reduced to a one - dimensional particle problem whose oscillatory behavior for an effective potential @xmath17 about the equilibrium point is provided by @xmath18 .",
    "given the equation of state ( eos ) on the hypersurface we plot the parametric stability condition @xmath19 to determine the possible stable regions .",
    "our samples of eos consist of a linear gas , various forms of chaplygin gas and a logarithmic gas .",
    "we consider tsw also in the recently found melvin - bertotti - robinson magnetic universe @xcite . in the bertotti - robinson limit the wormhole is supported by total positive energy for any finite extension in the axial direction . for infinite extension",
    "the total energy reduces to zero , at least better than the total negative classical energy .",
    "organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "construction of tsw from the magnetic melvin spacetime is introduced in sec .",
    "stability of the tsw is discussed in sec .",

    "let s start with the melvin magnetic universe spacetime @xcite in its axially symmetric form@xmath20 in which @xmath21where @xmath1 denotes the magnetic field constant . the maxwell field two - form",
    ", however , is given by@xmath22we note that the melvin solution in einstein - maxwell theory does not represent a black hole solution .",
    "the solution is regular everywhere as seen from the ricci scalar and ricci sequence @xmath23as well as the kretschmann scalar@xmath24 in @xcite , the general conditions which should be satisfied to have cylindrical wormhole possible are discussed . in brief , while the stronger condition implies that @xmath25 should take its minimum value at the throat , the weaker condition states that @xmath26 should be minimum at the throat .",
    "the stronger and weaker conditions are called _ radial flare - out and areal flare - out conditions _ respectively @xcite . as we shall see in the sequel , in the case of tsw @xmath25 and @xmath27 should only be increasing function at the throat in _ radial flare - out and areal flare - out conditions .",
    "_ in the case of the melvin spacetime , @xmath28and @xmath29one easily finds that _ areal flare - out condition _ is trivially satisfied and the _ radial flare - out condition _ requires @xmath30 . _",
    "_    following visser @xcite , from the bulk spacetime ( 1 ) we cut two non - asymptotically flat copies @xmath31 from a radius @xmath32 with @xmath33 and then we glue them at a hypersurface @xmath34 which is defined as @xmath35 in this way the resultant manifold is complete . at hypersurface @xmath36 the induced line element is given by@xmath37 in which @xmath38where a dot stands for derivative with respect to the proper time @xmath39 on the hypersurface @xmath36 .",
    "the israel junction conditions which are the einstein equations on the junction hypersurface read as ( @xmath40)@xmath41 in which @xmath42 @xmath43 and @xmath44is the extrinsic curvature . also the normal unit vector is defined as @xmath45and @xmath46diag@xmath47 is the energy momentum tensor on @xmath36 .",

    "recently , we have generalized the stability of tsws in cylindrical symmetric bulks in @xcite . here",
    "we apply the same method to the tsws in melvin universe .",
    "similar to the spherical symmetric tsw , we start with the energy conservation identity on the shell which implies@xmath58   \\frac{da}{d\\tau } \\\\ = \\frac{da}{d\\tau } \\frac{u^{\\prime } } { u}\\left ( 4-a\\frac{u^{\\prime } } { u}% \\right ) \\sqrt{\\delta } .\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    as we have shown in previous section the expressions given for surface energy density @xmath59 and surface pressures @xmath60 and @xmath61 are for a dynamic wormhole .",

    "we also note that a prime denotes derivative with respect to its argument , for instance @xmath80 while @xmath81 now , if we expand the equation of motion of the throat about @xmath70 we find ( up to second order)@xmath82 in which @xmath83 and @xmath84 this equation describes the motion of a harmonic oscillator provided @xmath85 which is the case of stability .",
    "if @xmath86 it implies that after the perturbation an exponential form fails to return back to its equilibrium point and therefore the wormhole is called unstable .    to conclude about the stability of the tsw in melvin magnetic space we should examine the sign of @xmath87 and in any region where @xmath88 the wormhole is stable and in contrast if @xmath89 we conclude that the wormhole is unstable . from eq .",
