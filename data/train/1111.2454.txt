    "we consider a string and higher - dimensional gravity inspired scalar field model , with two kind of couplings : kinetic coupling to curvatures and gauss bonnet coupling to the scalar field .",

    "nevertheless it affects cosmological dynamics when it is coupled to a dynamically evolving scalar field through arbitrary function of the field , giving rise to second order differential equations of motion , preserving the theory ghost free . therefore , the coupled gb term seems as a natural generalization of the scalar field with non - minimal kinetic coupling to curvature @xcite .",
    "+ some late time cosmological aspects of scalar field model with derivative couplings to curvature have been considered in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . on the other hand , the gb invariant coupled to scalar field have been extensively studied . in @xcite",
    "the gb correction was proposed to study the dynamics of dark energy , where it was found that quintessence or phantom phase may occur in the late time universe .",

    "all these studies demonstrate that it is quite plausible that the scalar - tensor couplings predicted by the fundamental theory may become important at current , low - curvature universe ( see @xcite and @xcite for review ) .",

    "the gb coupling has the advantage that does not make contributions higher than second order ( in the metric ) to the equations of motion , and therefore does not introduce ghost terms into the theory .",
