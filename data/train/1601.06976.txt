    "droplet - based microfluidics is a promising tool for performing biochemical or chemical assays or to observe liquid - liquid extraction @xcite .",
    "droplets are unit systems of controlled volume and content , within which mixing , reacting and/or transferring can be achieved . therefore , a comprehensive understanding of droplet migration in microchannels is essential to many microfluidics applications .",
    "rectangular channels with a width significantly larger than the height are commonly used in microfluidics devices . in such cases ,",
    "the confinement of the droplet is only in the vertical direction and the droplet is exposed to a two - dimensional poiseuille flow ( as in a hele ",
    "shaw cell ) .",
    "the migration of the droplet is driven by the ambient fluid with an average inflow velocity @xmath0 and a constant terminal migration velocity @xmath1 will be reached .",
    "the ratio between the horizontal radius of the droplet ( @xmath2 ) and half of the channel height ( @xmath3 ) has been shown to have a strong effect on the droplet migration velocity @xmath1 in a microchannel ( hereafter we simply refer to @xmath1 as the droplet velocity since the transient process is not of interest in the present study ) .",
    "the overall variation of @xmath1 with @xmath4 can be seen in the experiments by roberts _",
    "et al._@xcite , ( the experimental results will be shown later in section [ sec:3d ] ) and can be divided into three different regimes according to the dominant mechanism :    * poiseuille - dominated regime ( regime p ) , @xmath5 . in this regime",
    "the droplet velocity is dominated by the poiseuille flow in the hele  shaw cell . in the limit of @xmath6 ( as the droplet is a point mass ) the droplet at the centerline of the channel will move with the maximum fluid velocity ( @xmath7 ) . as @xmath2 increases the droplet",
    "is exposed to the parabolic fluid velocity profile with a decreasing velocity toward the top and bottom walls and the droplet slows down .",
    "theoretical studies on the migration of droplets much smaller than the channel height have been conducted in many previous works , see for example nadim and stone @xcite and hudson @xcite .",
    "* film - dominated regime ( regime f ) , @xmath8 : in this regime , the droplet overfills the channel and a thin lubrication film is formed between the droplet and the wall .",
    "the droplet loses its roughly spherical geometry and becomes `` pancake - like '' .",
    "furthermore , the droplet velocity @xmath1 becomes independent of @xmath4 and is mainly dictated by the lubrication film .",
    "the film thickness @xmath9 is governed by the balance between surface tension and viscous stresses .",
    "as the former tends to minimize the interface curvature and pushes the droplet interface closer to the wall , the latter tends to open up the gap between the droplet and the wall .",
    "therefore the capillary number ( @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the viscosity of the ambient fluid and the surface tension , respectively ) , which is the ratio between the viscous and surface tension forces , is critical in determining the film thickness and the droplet mobility in this regime @xcite . beyond the capillary number , the viscosity ratio between the droplet and the ambient fluid has also been shown to have a significant influence on the lubrication film thickness and the flow pattern @xcite .",
    "* transition regime ( regime t ) , @xmath13 : this regime connects the previous two regimes .",
    "as the droplet radius is comparable to half of the channel height , the effect of confinement on the droplet becomes significant . as a result ,",
    "the droplet velocity decreases dramatically with @xmath4 in this regime .",

    "the experimental and numerical results of roberts _ et al._@xcite clearly show the variation of droplet velocity in the poiseuille - dominated regime , and close agreement with theoretical predictions has been achieved .",
    "the experimental data in the film - dominated regime is less documented however .",
    "furthermore , simulation results for the transition and film - dominated regimes are not provided , due to the numerical challenge in resolving the thin film @xcite .",
    "the present study aims at improving the current understanding of droplet motion in microchannels , in particular the droplet dynamics in the transition and film - dominated regimes .",
    "in contrast with scenarios in which the droplet is much smaller than the channel height , the dynamics of droplets in the film - dominated regime ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath17 ) are more complicated and less understood .",
    "early efforts in predicting the velocity of a flat bubble in a hele ",
    "shaw cell go back to the pioneering theoretical work by taylor and saffman @xcite .",
    "shaw equations are obtained by averaging the stokes equations along the channel height ( depth ) , and it can be shown that the bubble velocity @xmath1 is always larger than the average inflow velocity @xmath0 . for low capillary numbers , the horizontal cross - section of the bubble is close to a circle ( exhibiting a pancake shape similar to the present problem ) @xcite , then @xmath18 according to the taylor ",

    "( for such a thin film , the intermolecular forces become important for the film dynamics and droplet velocity . in the present study",
    ", we focus on the cases where the minimum film thickness is always larger than one micrometer . as a result ,",
    "the effects of intermolecular forces can be ignored . )",
    "however it is very challenging to probe local values of velocity and pressure , and consequently the flow structure inside and outside of the droplet is hard to obtain . numerical simulations which provide a complete description of the flow field",
    "can shed light on the present problem .",
    "it has been shown that numerical approximations of the navier - stokes equations can represent flow physics in many microfluidics applications , such as droplets / bubbles migration and the breakup of droplets at t - junctions @xcite .",
    "nevertheless 3d direct numerical simulations of droplet migration in a microchannel are challenging as well .",
    "this is in particular true for droplets with large ratio @xmath4 and small ca .",
    "since capillary effects are dominant , the time step used in the temporal integration is controlled by the surface tension term in the momentum equation . for small capillary numbers",
    "the time step becomes very small and thus the number of steps for the terminal velocity of droplet to be reached is huge .",
    "in addition , at low capillary numbers the thickness of the lubrication film becomes very small ( several orders of magnitude smaller than the channel height ) @xcite .",
    "since the mesh resolution and the time step restriction are dictated by the smallest length scale in the problem , the total number of cells and integration steps in 3d simulations are both very large .",
    "three - dimensional simulation results of droplet / bubble in microchannels are rarely seen until the very recent works by hoang _",
    "et al._@xcite , roberts _ et al._@xcite and zhu and gallaire @xcite .",
    "however , as far as the authors are aware , a 3d direct numerical solution to the navier - stokes equations for droplets with a large @xmath4 and with a lubrication film formed has never been reported in the literature .",
    "the goal of the present study is to investigate the droplet migration in a hele  shaw cell through 3d direct numerical simulations .",
    "the capillary number of the droplet is considered to be small enough so that the horizontal shape of the droplet is near - circular all the time .",
    "particular attention will be paid to the effect of the lubrication film on the droplet dynamics .",
    "a two - phase flow solver , gerris@xcite , is employed to solve the variable - density navier - stokes equation with surface tension . in the gerris solver ,",
    "the volume - of - fluid ( vof ) method is used to resolve the interface between the two phases and an adaptive mesh is used to refine the mesh only in the lubrication film and near the interface , so that the computational cost can be reduced .",

    "the simulation results and discussions for the 3d droplet are then presented in section [ sec:3d ] .",
    "finally , we draw conclusions on the present study .",
    "the one - fluid approach is employed to resolve the two - phase flow , where the phases corresponding to the droplet and the ambient fluid are treated as one fluid with material properties that change abruptly across the interface .",
    "the incompressible , variable - density , navier - stokes equations with surface tension can be written as @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 represent density and viscosity , velocity and pressure , respectively .",

    "( [ eq : mom ] ) and ( [ eq : divfree ] ) ) are solved by the open - source package gerris@xcite . in gerris , a finite volume approach based on a projection method is employed .",
    "a staggered - in - time discretisation of the volume - fraction / density and pressure leads to a formally second - order accurate time discretisation .",
    "the interface between the different fluids are tracked and followed using a volume - of - fluid ( vof ) method @xcite .",
    "a quad / octree spatial discretisation is used , which gives a very important flexibility allowing dynamic grid refinement into user - defined regions @xcite .",
    "finally the height - function ( hf ) method is utilized to calculate the local interface curvature , and a balanced - force surface tension discretization is used @xcite .",
    "both temporal and spatial schemes of integration are explicit .",
    "therefore , numerical stability requires the time step for integration to satisfy the stability conditions corresponding to the advection , viscous , and surface tension terms , respectively . due to the small capillary number in the present problem , the time step restriction is dominated by the contribution from the surface tension force .",

    "et al._@xcite as , @xmath40 where @xmath41 represents the cell size . for droplets with large @xmath4 ,",
    "the thickness of the lubrication film is the smallest scale in the problem and thus dictates the smallest cell size and the time step to be used .",

    "the adaptive mesh refinement in gerris allows to refine the mesh only in the lubrification film , which greatly decreases this cost , however this is still not sufficient to reach such low capillary numbers .",
    "a different capillary time step restriction has been proposed by galusinski and vigneaux @xcite .",
    "they suggested that when both @xmath51 and @xmath52 are very small , the capillary time step should satisfy @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the capillary time step related to the stokes equation ( when inertial effects are negligible ) .",
    "it can then easily be shown that the ratio @xmath55 . therefore , if @xmath56 the larger time step @xmath57 can be used . in the present study , however , we are interested in the cases where @xmath58 and @xmath52 varies from @xmath59 to @xmath60 ( see the detailed values in section [ sec:3d ] ) . as a consequence ,",
