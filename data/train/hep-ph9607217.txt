    "the inelastic form factors @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and their scaling versions @xmath9 and @xmath10 , describing spin - dependent or polarized deep - inelastic scattering are attracting much attention at present with major experimental programmes in progress at cern and slac and planned for hera .",
    "for a comprehensive account see the review article  [ 1 ] by anselmino , efremov and leader ( ael ) .",
    "the theoretical and experimental status of @xmath9 and @xmath10 is rather different .",
    "there exists a simple partonic interpretation  [ 2 ] of the scaling function @xmath1 which is the only one of the two which survives in the strict bjorken limit and , in that limit , completely controls the longitudinal polarization asymmetry .",
    "longitudinal polarization dominates kinematically in this limit and is described in qcd as a leading ( twist 2 ) effect .",
    "the function @xmath1 is also the easier one to measure experimentally  [ 3,4 ] .",
    "the main theoretical issue is the subtle effect whereby the triangle anomaly induces an anomalous gluon contribution in @xmath1 , in particular in its first moment  [ 5,6 ] .",
    "@xmath8 and the corresponding dimensionless scaling function @xmath10 are more complicated .",
    "they describe the difference between the properties of a longitudinally and a transversely polarized hadron , and qcd twist 3 effects , for which there is no probabilistic interpretation , contribute significantly  [ 7 ] .",
    "the transverse polarization effects are suppressed like @xmath11 ( @xmath12 is the hadron mass ; recall that a massless particle is always longitudinally polarized ) .",
    "this makes the experimental studies more complicated as well .",
    "the first results from smc and slac have just appeared  [ 8 ] and it is hoped that the high intensity lepton beam and jet target will make possible the measurement of @xmath10 with high accuracy by the hermes collaboration at hera .    in this situation sum rules for @xmath10",
    "are especially important .",
    "the burkhardt - cottingham superconvergence sum rule  [ 9 ] is well known : ^1_0 g_2(x)dx=0 though it is not always realised that it does not follow from the operator product expansion and that it may contradict the expected small-@xmath13 regge behaviour  [ 1,10 ] .",
    "the other sum rules that are often quoted are the wandzura - wilzcek sum rules  [ 11 ] ^1_0 x^n-1dx=0n=1,3,5which , as is discussed below , involve the neglect of twist-3 contributions and which assumes the validity of  ( 1 ) .. ] if the sum rules in  ( 2 ) are assumed to hold also for even values of @xmath14 , one obtains the remarkable result g_1(x ) + g_2(x)=^1_xdx . the function @xmath2 _ defined _ by  ( 3 )",
    "is often called @xmath15 .    in [ 11 ] it is argued , on the basis of a model , that the twist 3 terms can be neglected . however , this argument is unreliable , since the selfsame model gives unacceptable results for @xmath16 and @xmath1 .",
    "we shall discuss the derivation of sum rules involving @xmath2 from two different points of view .",
    "one is based upon the imposition of gauge invariance in a specific lepton - hadron reaction , namely polarized dis , the second upon a study of the properties of the hadronic matrix elements involved in @xmath4 , without reference to any specific reaction .    in both these approaches we are able to produce _ new _ sum rules that do not follow from the operator product expansion .",
    "the ope only makes statements about the _ odd _ moments of @xmath4 , corresponding to the fact one is essentially dealing with forward virtual compton scattering , which , viewed in the t - channel , involves @xmath17 , and thus only involves positive parity states .    in our more general approach we obtain results also for the _ even _ moments of @xmath4 . but",
    "what is fascinating , and at first sight surprising , is that these sum rules involve _ only the valence contributions _ to the structure functions .    amongst these",
    "the most interesting is the case @xmath6 , the so - called efremov , leader , teryaev ( elt ) sum rule , since it is exact and does not rely on any neglect of twist-3 contributions : ^1_0 dx x=0 and which , as we shall discuss , can be tested experimentally .    in sections 2 and 3",
    "we show how to derive these generalised sum rules first by appealing to gauge invariance in polarized dis , second by a detailed study of the properties of various hadronic matrix elements .",
    "section 4 discusses some aspects of the elt sum rules and their generalization and in section 5 we consider how the new sum rules might be tested experimentally .",
    "consider first the field - theoretic calculation of the antisymmetric part of the hadronic tensor @xmath18 which controls polarized deep inelastic scattering , via the feynman diagrams of fig .  1 .",
    "because we are dealing with twist 3 effects it is necessary to consider the quark - quark - gluon correlators : b_a(x_1,x_2)= e^i_1(x_1-x_2)+i_2x_2_a(_1,_2 ) where _",
    "a(_1,_2)= p , s||(0)n^5sd(_1n)(_2n)|p , sand b_v(x_1,x_2)= e^i_1(x_1-x_2)+i_2x_2_v(_1,_2 ) where _",
    "v(_1,_2)=-^s_p_n_p , s||(0)n d_(_1n)(_2n)|p , swhere @xmath19 is the covariant derivative and @xmath20 is a light - like gauge fixing vector : @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "it also defines the transverse direction ; for example , for the covariant spin vector @xmath24 , s^_t = s^- ( sn)p^.    the fractions @xmath25 and @xmath26 correspond to the fractions of the hadron momentum carried by the quarks . in these definitions",
    "the correlators @xmath27 and @xmath28 are real and dimensionless .",
    "they are related to the correlators used in ael by @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "they have the symmetry properties b_v(x_1,x_2 ) = -b_v(x_2,x_1)b_a(x_1,x_2 ) = b_a(x_2,x_1 ) .    in eqns .",
    "( 58 ) we have suppressed the flavour label @xmath31 on the quark fields .",
    "use of the equation of motion for the quark field of a given flavour leads to a very general relation between @xmath32 and the quark - quark correlator function @xmath33 which directly gives the field - theoretic expression for the transverse combination of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , namely g_t(x)g_1(x ) + g_2(x)=_f q^2_fwhere f_t ( x ) = e^ixf_t (  ) and f_t()=p , s||(0)_5s(n)|p , swhere , again , we suppress the flavour label .    for an arbitrary test function @xmath34 one",
    "finds  [ 12 ] dxdy\\{b_a(x , y ) + b_v(x , y)}=-2dx(x ) xf_t(x ) .",
    "further , demanding that the results for @xmath18 be independent of the gauge fixing vector @xmath20 leads to a relation between @xmath35 and the quark - quark correlator function @xmath36 which gives the field - theoretic formula for @xmath1 , namely g_1(x)=_fq^2_fwhere h_l(x)=e^ixh_l( ) and h_l()= p , s||(0)n_5(n)|p , s .",
    "one finds [ 12 ] dxdyb_a(x , y)= dx(x ) .",

    "( 14 ) and ( 18 ) the range of integration is @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .    for the longitudinal case it is possible to associate @xmath40 , for each flavour , with a polarized quark or antiquark number density : q(x)=h_l(x)|q(x)=h_l(-x ) but",
    "such a connection is not possible for the transverse spin case .    in ( 18 )",
    "let us now choose @xmath41 , with @xmath14 odd .",
    "the integral @xmath42 on the rhs of ( 18 ) can then be converted into an integral @xmath43 , leading via ( 11 ) and ( 15 ) to [ 12 ] + & & _ f q^2_fdxdy b_a(x , y ) where _",

    "the ope , however , says nothing about the case @xmath46 .",
    "indeed ( 24 ) may not be valid for @xmath46 because the integrals could diverge .",
    "we see that the lhs of ( 24 ) is just the lhs of the wandzura - wilczek sum rule  ( 2 ) .",
    "the ww sum rule was originally derived from the operator product expansion by neglecting twist 3 operators on the rhs and by assuming that the operator product result can be continued smoothly to @xmath46 , where , of course , the ww sum rule just reduces to the burkhardt - cottingham sum rule  ( 1 ) .",
    "the quark - quark - gluon correlators in our approach combine the contributions related to terms of twist 2 and 3 in the operator product expansion .",
    "however , it is possible to separate them .",
    "note that the matrix elements , containing the covariant derivative , are actually _ not _ gauge invariant .",
    "this is because the derivative and the quark field it is acting on are taken at different points on the light cone .",
    "one can easily pass to a gauge - invariant form by shifting the gluon field to the point of the quark field and express the compensating term @xmath47 in terms of the gluon field strength ( the latter is possible because an axial gauge is used ) .",
    "this contradicts earlier statements  [ 13 ] that transverse momentum and gluon field are combined together in a gauge - invariant way .    if we neglect the contribution coming from @xmath48 but keep the transverse momentum contribution embedded in the covariant derivative , we obtain a result of the form  [ 14 ] b_a(x_1,x_2)=_a(x_1)(x_1-x_2)b_v(x_1,x_2)=0 . from this",

    "( 3 ) , and which , as mentioned , was originally  derived \" from the ope by neglecting twist 3 contributions .",
    "the above discussion shows that the twist 2 contributions do take account of the transverse motion of the quark  [ 15,16 ] .",
    "there are good reasons to believe that bc sum rule will fail because the expected regge behaviour for @xmath2 as @xmath49 might make the integral over @xmath2 diverge  [ 10 ]",
    ".    contrary to the operator product approach , one can certainly choose @xmath50 with @xmath14 _ even _ in ( 18 ) and @xmath51 with @xmath14 even in ( 14 ) , to obtain a totally new set of sum rules , which , however , do not involve @xmath1 or @xmath2 as such , but a part of them , @xmath52 and @xmath53 which can be regarded as the _ valence contribution _ to them . for @xmath1 , which has a simple partonic interpretation ,",
    "this is straightforward . for @xmath2 , which does not have a partonic interpretation it is not clear what @xmath53 means physically .",
    "however , it is a well defined object , _ which can be measured _ , and thus sum rules involving it are of physical importance .",

    "thus one has ^1_0",
    "this so - called efremov , leader , teryaev ( elt ) sum rule was incorrectly stated in ael  [ 1 ] where the label  @xmath56 \" was not indicated .",
    "we shall return to discuss certain aspects of the elt sum rule , the possibility of testing it physically , its convergence properties and whether or not it can be generalised , after first discussing a quite different approach to the sum rule .",
    "the derivation of the sum rules in section 2 is a little unsatisfactory in that it appeals to a particular lepton - hadron reaction to derive properties inherent to the nucleon .",
    "the following derivation deals only with nucleon matrix elements .",
    "the sum rules can be derived from a careful study of the structure and gauge properties of the matrix elements and use of the equation of motion of the quark field . in this approach  [ 1 ]",
    "one sees very clearly why sum rules like the burkhardt - cottingham one may fail because of the non - invertability of certain fourier transforms .",

    "this result will be crucial for deriving the efremov - leader - teryaev sum rule .",

    "( 30 ) we obtain , once again , the elt sum rule ^1_0 dxx=0 .",
    "we discuss here firstly the question of the convergence of the elt sum rule ( 32 ) , then consider an analogous sum rule involving the complete functions @xmath4 and not just their valence parts and then comment upon an implication for the concept of _ handedness _ of jets .    as mentioned earlier the burkhardt - cottingham sum rule ( 1 ) may well diverge because of a possible @xmath72 growth of @xmath2 as @xmath49 .",
    "it is important to note that such a singular behaviour will not spoil the convergence of the elt sum rule ( 32 ) , since the singularity will cancel out in the subtraction in ( 31 ) .",
    "consider now the question of the analogue of ( 32 ) for the complete functions @xmath4 .",
    "in contrast to the operator product expansion , the sum rules ( 14 ) hold for @xmath41 with @xmath14 odd or even and the sum rules ( 18 ) hold for @xmath73 with @xmath14 odd or even . for @xmath14 odd and @xmath74",
    "they reproduce the ope results for the moments of @xmath4 . for @xmath14",
    "even they produce new sum rules for the moments of the _ valence _ parts of @xmath4 .",
    "however , it is possible to consider sum rules for @xmath14 even from a different point of view , namely from the analytic continuation in @xmath14 of the results for @xmath14 odd .",
    "hence we wish to begin with ( 20 ) and ( 23 ) and analytically continue in @xmath14 .",
    "as written the rh sides of ( 20 ) and ( 23 ) do not have a unique analytic continuation since @xmath13 and @xmath75 can be negative so that terms of the form @xmath76 and @xmath77 effectively reproduce factors of @xmath78 which grow exponentially in the imaginary @xmath14 direction and spoil the uniqueness of the analytic continuation .",
    "however , starting with @xmath14 odd we can rewrite all the integrals in ( 20 ) and ( 23 ) in such a way that @xmath43 and @xmath79 after which the analytic continuation is unique",
    ". we shall not give the detailed results for arbitrary @xmath14 , but for @xmath6 we find ^1_0 dx x=_f q^2_f^1_0 dy ^1-y_0 dx    the matrix elements on the rhs of ( 59 ) are not zero and can not be expressed as a finite series of matrix elements of local operators .",
    "however they are of twist-3 and are proportional to the square root of the product of the probability to find a gluon and the probability to find a @xmath80 pair in the nucleon .",
    "the latter was estimated to be small from the study of qcd sum rules by shuryak and vainshtein  [ 17 ] .",
    "so it may be that the rhs of ( 59 ) is negligible , corresponding to the wandzura - wilzcek sum rules ( 2 ) continued to @xmath6 .",
    "together with the burkhardt - cottingham sum rule ( 1 ) , this means that @xmath81 should intersect the experimental @xmath2 at least twice in the interval @xmath82 which seems compatible with the present slac data  [ 8 ] .",
    "the method used in section 3 to derive sum rules for the first and second moments of @xmath4 highlights an interesting aspect of the burkhardt - cottingham sum rule .",
    "the assumption that all the scalar functions @xmath83 are well behaved as @xmath69 , as implied by the assumed behaviour @xmath62 as @xmath63 means , as can be seen from ( 36 ) , that the first moments of the longitudinal @xmath84 and the transverse @xmath85 depend on the matrix element of the axial vector current which is proportional to just the single vectorial structure @xmath24 .",
    "there is no reference to any direction which could differentiate longitudinal from transverse , so the first moments of @xmath86 and @xmath87 coincide .",
    "this seems very similar to the  naive \" derivation of the bc sum rule from rotational invariance  [ 2 ] as well as to the early qcd derivation  [ 18 ] .",
    "( it would be interesting to understand analogously the _ physical _ meaning of ( 32 ) written as @xmath88 . )",
    "an analogous situation arises for the new spin - dependent variable _ handedness _ ( h ) introduced in  [ 19 ] , which allows the study of the polarization of a quark or gluon which has fragmented into a jet .",
    "h is given as a product of the quark polarization times the analyzing power a of the fragmentation reaction .",
    "the analyzing power is described by light - cone functions analogous to @xmath36 and @xmath33 . as discussed in  [ 19 ] longitudinal and transverse analyzing powers",
    "coincide in the case of _ particle _ decay as a consequence of rotational invariance , but in the  decay \" of the jet the light - cone vector @xmath20  remembers \" the jet direction resulting in a difference between longitudinal and transverse analyzing powers .",
    "but by the same reasoning as above , the _ first moment _ of the longitudinal and transverse analyzing powers should coincide .",
    "the integration variable in this case is @xmath71 , the fraction of the parton s momentum carried by a pair ( or triple ) of particles used to define the jet .",
    "let us now consider how the new sum rules can be used to learn about @xmath2 and to test qcd .",
    "the general field theoretic expression for @xmath2 in terms of hadronic matrix elements of operators is given in ( 11 ) , ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) .",
    "as mentioned earlier , despite appearances to the contrary , @xmath2 does not have any simple probabilistic parton model interpretation even though only quark operators appear in the matrix element  ( 13 ) .",
    "nonetheless it is given by a sum over contributions coming from quark operators of definite flavour @xmath31 ( the flavour label was suppressed in section  2 ) , so that the contribution of a given flavour of quark or antiquark to @xmath2 is meaningful .",
    "moreover , since the flavour label is clearly irrelevant in the derivation , it must be true that ( 32 ) holds for the contribution to @xmath2 of _ each _ flavour .",
    "hence one has , for each flavour @xmath31 , ^1_0 dxx=0 .",
    "information about the contributions of a given flavour to @xmath2 can be obtained by studying reactions with different targets and by studying non - purely - electromagnetic dis , for example charge changing dis involving @xmath89 exchange or , at large @xmath90 , interference between @xmath91 and @xmath92 exchange .",
    "there is also the possibility of focussing on specific flavours by looking at semi - inclusive dis .",
    "there thus appear to be several possibilities to learn about @xmath93",
    ".    1 .   assuming , as usual , that the contributions from sea quarks are the same in protons and neutrons",
