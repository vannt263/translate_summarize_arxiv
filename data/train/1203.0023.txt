    "the interplay between starlight and dust in spiral galaxies is enormously complex . in the last decade",
    ", space - based observatories have allowed astronomers to measure spectral energy distributions ( seds ) from the ultraviolet ( uv ) through the far - infrared ( fir ) .",
    "these seds show that radiative transfer ( rt ) models based only on optical data ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* xilouris et al . 1999 ) ) significantly overpredict the amount of escaping uv radiation and underpredict the amount of dust present in edge - on spirals ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* popescu et al . 2000 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bianchi 2008 , hereafter b08 ) ) . to combat",
    "this problem astronomers have created more complex models , including additional stellar disk components and semi - analytic approximations for the effects of enshrouded star formation with clumpy dust and light .",
    "most of these `` advanced '' models have focused exclusively on fitting galaxy seds at the expense of creating models with observationally accurate images , due to the difficulty in fitting non - axisymmetric parameters like clumpy dust substructures or spiral arms .",
    "we have recently completed a preliminary investigation into optimizing non - axisymmetric rt models fit to high - resolution _ hubble space telescope _ optical images of the central region of the edge - on spiral galaxy ngc 891 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* schechtman - rook et al . 2011 ) ) .",
    "these models included fractally clumped dust and logarithmic spiral arms specially designed to match observations of the arm / interarm ratios of face - on spiral galaxies .",
    "the best - fitting models show a strong preference for spirality and clumpiness . here",
    "we investigate the effect of the spirality and clumping parameters determined from these fits to optical images on fitting the seds of ngc 891 and m51 .",
    "we use a new 3d monte carlo rt code ( hyperion , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* robitaille et al . 2011 ) ) , which uses arbitrary dust and emissivity grids and includes multiple dust grain sizes ( including pahs ) .",
    "our 100x100x50 pixel sed models are mapped to a 40x40x20 kpc volume .",
    "stellar emission is set to the sb spectrum of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fioc & rocca - volmerange ( 1997 ) ) , split into a old population of stars with masses @xmath03 m@xmath1(bulge and disk-1 ) and an young population ( m @xmath2 m@xmath1 ; disk-2 ) .",
    "model parameters are shown in table 1 .",
    "m@xmath3 is the total dust mass , l@xmath4 and l@xmath5 are the total bolometric _ disk _ luminosities , and t denotes the density threshold for young stellar emission ( where appropriate ) .",
    "all models have a sersic n=4 bulge with l@xmath6l@xmath1 and structural parameters identical to those used in bianchi ( 2008 )",
    ". the model ratios of old - to - young stellar populations span unredenned , spatially - integrated seds corresponding to a wide range of hubble types ( for reference template e , sa , sc , im galaxies from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fioc & rocca - volmerange ( 1997 ) ) have old - to - young ratios of 35,9.8,2.3,1.1 , respectively ) .",
    "disk-1 has half the scale - length and twice the scale - height of the dust .",
    "disk-2 has the same scales as the dust , and when it is clumpy it follows the distribution of the clumpy dust ; higher dust density cells weighted to have more stellar emission .",
    "clumpiness and spirality are consistent with what we found in schechtman - rook et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , i.e. , 50% of the dust mass is put in clumps distributed in 130 parent cells ; spiral arms have a pitch angle of 20@xmath7 and a relative strength of 50% . for models 4 and 5",
    "there is a minimum dust density required to place disk-2 emission in a cell ; this threshold mimics the effects of embedded star formation .",

    "single disk models are unable to simultaneously match the uv and fir sed of ngc 891 , even when the dust mass and stellar luminosity are increased or clumpiness and spirality are added .",
    "the poor fit from single disk models was also noted by ( * ? ? ?",
    "adding spirality , regardless of the amplitude of the spiral perturbations , has almost no effect on the spatially - integrated sed morphology , a result found also by ( * ? ? ?",

    "restricting the young stellar emission to areas of higher dust density ( model 4 ) allows us to dramatically increase the luminosity of the second disk without increasing the dust mass .",
    "this density threshold appears to be unique for any combination of disk luminosities and dust masses  higher thresholds push the dust peak too far into the blue , while at lower thresholds the model can not simultaneously reproduce the uv , fir , and 12 @xmath15 m pah feature . while this model still predicts a low 24 @xmath15 m flux ,",
    "high - resolution simulations of individual dust clouds indicate that this discrepancy is due to the unresolved nature of the dense clumps in our simulations ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* b08 ) ) .",
    "we investigated the viability of our models at other projected inclinations by comparing them to m51 ( @xmath16 ; figure 1 ) . for simplicity",
    "we fix all geometric parameters ( including clumping and spirality ) of the dust and stellar distributions as well as l@xmath5 , and allow only m@xmath3 and l@xmath4 to vary . a good match to the observed , spatially integrated sed ( except at 24@xmath15 m , as explained above ) is found by increasing the dust mass by 75% and halving the old - disk luminosity ( model 5 ) .",
    "the fir flux distributions indicate that m51 has a dearth of cold dust compared to n891 despite m51 s increased dust mass , consistent with elevated star - formation induced by m51 s ongoing interaction .",
    "while the addition of spirality has little effect on the shape of the spatially - integrated sed , it does produce a gradient in the uv / blue light across the major axis of the model .",
    "this gradient is present in ngc 891 and is commonly considered to be due to the presence of a a grand design spiral pattern @xcite .",
    "this gradient presents an opportunity to better constrain the otherwise hidden thin disk of edge - ons , and can only be fit by models with non - axisymmetric structure like ours .",
