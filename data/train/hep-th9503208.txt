    "a very interesting aspect of string theory is the way in which space - time is described . in physics , thanks to the success of general relativity , we are accustomed to picturing space - time as being a manifold equipped with a metric .",
    "the physics of space - time is then described in terms of this metric .",
    "such a picture has some potential shortcomings .",
    "in particular we may wish to consider some space - time which is not smooth and thus may not admit a metric in the conventional sense .",
    "one way to treat such a space may be as a limit of a sequence of smooth manifolds which converges to the desired space .",
    "thus the `` metric '' on the singular space is approximated by this sequence of smooth metrics .",
    "while such a picture appears natural from a viewpoint of general relativity it may be that it is not so natural from a string theory point of view . in this paper",
    "we illustrate precisely this point by considering a singular space which classically appears as the limit of a sequence of smooth manifolds and then showing that a string theory on the singular space can not be deformed into a string theory on any of the smooth manifolds which approximate it .",
    "the framework in which we will work is one of the most successful for studying stringy aspects of geometry .",
    "that is , we look at @xmath2=(2,2 ) superconformal field theories and their associated  target spaces .",
    "we also restrict ourselves in this paper to the rich class of complex dimension three target spaces .",
    "the usefulness of @xmath2=(2,2 ) theories is that one can understand the geometry of the target manifold without any explicit reference to the target space metric ( see , for example , @xcite for a review ) .",
    "one may also study many singular spaces , such as orbifolds @xcite , without any inherent difficulties .",
    "the deformations of a  manifold can be understood in terms of marginal operators in the associated conformal field theory .",
    "if the target space is singular , rather than being a manifold , the marginal operators presumably still tell one how to deform the singular space .",
    "certain of these deformations may remove some , or perhaps all , of the singularities .",
    "this process is well - understood in many cases of orbifolds ( see , for example , @xcite ) where twisted marginal operators in the conformal field theory can be matched to the `` blow - ups '' of the orbifold , i.e. , deformations which resolve ( at least partially ) the quotient singularities of the orbifold .    in @xcite",
    "some examples of more troublesome orbifolds were studied .",
    "it was found that certain of the deformations of the classical orbifold appeared to be `` missing '' in the conformal field theory language .",
    "that is , these geometric deformations could not be seen by the string theory .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to shed some light on the geometrical explanation for such a phenomenon .",
    "we will see that there is a truly stringy explanation for such obstructions .",
    "these obstructions are due to world - sheet instantons wrapping themselves around particular elements of the second homology group of the target space .",
    "the construction of @xcite rests upon the study of `` discrete torsion . ''",
    "there is some potential for confusion on the subject of discrete torsion and we will clearly set out our definitions here .",
    "given a conformal field theory for a  manifold @xmath3 with a discrete symmetry group @xmath4 , one may build the theory for the quotient @xmath5 in a systematic way .",
    "there is an ambiguity in this construction however .",
    "phases may be introduced when building the partition function for the characters without disturbing modular invariance .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that these phases must be elements of @xmath6 .",
    "if @xmath4 is finite then this group is isomorphic to @xmath7 .",
    "( the coefficient group @xmath8 is assumed for homology and cohomology if omitted . )",
    "thus each element @xmath9 gives rise to a possible conformal field theory for the orbifold @xmath5 .",
    "we call @xmath10 the `` 2-cocycle '' for the theory . in @xcite some examples of orbifolds with a nontrivial 2-cocycle were studied and it was shown that each of the marginal operators could be associated to a deformation of the orbifold space itself , but that some deformations appeared to be `` missing , '' i.e. , corresponded to no marginal operator .",
    "the singular cohomology groups @xmath11 of a manifold @xmath12 need not be free abelian groups . of particular interest to us in this paper will be the torsion part of @xmath13 ( or equivalently @xmath14 ) where @xmath12 is a  manifold .",
    "we impose the condition @xmath15 . in this case",
    "the torsion group is isomorphic to the `` brauer group '' of @xmath12 .",
    "we will use this terminology here for convenience although the reader is not required to know the full definition of the brauer group .",
    "it was suggested in @xcite that there should be some connection between the brauer group and the 2-cocycles in an orbifold .",
    "an example studied in @xcite had trivial brauer group but admitted nontrivial 2-cocycles .",
    "thus these two concepts are not equivalent .",
    "as we shall see in this paper however there is some intimate connection between them . because the term `` discrete torsion '' has been used at times to refer to either the brauer group or the group of @xmath16-cocycles , we will try to avoid using it in this paper to save any confusion .",
    "although motivated by the orbifold construction of @xcite we shall see that stable singularities are probably not confined to such examples .",
    "the topological obstruction to deforming away the singularities may be thought of as `` hiding '' away in the singularity itself . to understand this geometrically",
    "we will blow up the singularity to expose its contents .",
    "this blow - up will not be a marginal perturbation as one is accustomed to in orbifold theory but rather will be an irrelevant perturbation .    in section [ s :",
    "amod ] we discuss how the brauer group affects the correlation functions of an @xmath2=(2,2 ) superconformal field theory . in particular we only need concern ourselves with that part of the conformal field theory which is present in the a - model ( which is one of the topological field theories obtained by twisting the original @xmath2=2 model ) .",
    "we will review how the brauer group adds a degree of freedom to the a - model that can not be expressed in terms of the khler form or the @xmath17-field .    in section [ s : ncrit ]",
    "we discuss blow - ups as irrelevant operators .",
    "this generalizes the usual notion of blow - ups in the context of orbifold theories which correspond to truly marginal operators .",
    "we will need such a generalization to deal with the singularities discussed in this paper .",
    "this allows us to study the examples of stable singularities in section [ s : egs ] .",
    "finally we present a discussion in section [ s : conc ] .",
    "in this section we will study the form of the correlation functions of the the a - model with target space @xmath12 where @xmath12 may have a non - trivial brauer group , that is , when @xmath14 contains a torsion subgroup . from the universal coefficient theorem ( see , for example , @xcite ) the torsion part of @xmath14 is isomorphic to the torsion part of @xmath13 .    the a - model is a topological field theory @xcite in which the correlation functions depend upon non - trivial instanton effects .",
    "the instantons are holomorphic maps from the world - sheet , @xmath18 , to the target space @xmath12 .",
    "further , the action of this instanton is assumed to depend only upon the homology class of the image of this map in @xmath12 .",
    "for an instanton @xmath19 with homology class @xmath20\\in h_2(x)$ ] , let us denote @xmath21 by @xmath22)$ ] , where @xmath23 is the action of the instanton . in order for string interactions to behave correctly @xcite we further demand that the action depend linearly upon the homology class of @xmath19 , i.e. , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the multiplicative group of nonzero complex numbers .",
    "recall that @xmath13 is an abelian group and thus may be decomposed into free and torsion subgroups : @xmath26 where @xmath27 are finite positive integers labeling the torsion part of @xmath13 .",
    "a simple application of the universal coefficient theorem tells us that @xmath28 . given the exact sequence @xmath29 we obtain the long exact sequence @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 denote the free and torsion parts of the abelian group @xmath4 respectively .    for the time",
    "being let us assume that @xmath33",
    ". then we see from ( [ eq : les1 ] ) that @xmath34 we usually think of the a - model correlation functions as depending upon the `` complexified khler form . ''",
    "this complexified khler form is written @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the usual khler form and @xmath17 is a real 2-form of @xmath12 defined modulo elements of de rham cohomology which are elements of integral cohomology .",
    "it is easy to see that this agrees with ( [ eq : nobr ] ) .",
    "let us form a basis of @xmath37 with elements @xmath38 .",
    "we may then expand @xmath39 where @xmath40 for all @xmath41 .",
    "we now introduce the usual @xmath42-variables : @xmath43 we then see that @xmath44)=\\prod_j q_j^{n_j([i])},\\ ] ] where @xmath45 are non - negative integers labeling the homology class of the instanton .",
    "when we calculate a correlation function in the a - model we use the usual methods of intersection theory in topological field theory @xcite .",
    "that is to say , for each instanton background , the contribution to the correlation function is given by the intersection number of some cycles representing the observables in the moduli space of the instanton .",
    "this intersection number is an integer .",
    "such a contribution to the correlation function is then weighted by @xmath22)$ ] .",
    "we thus see that the correlation functions in this a - model take the form of power series in the variables @xmath46 with _ integer _ coefficients .",
    "all of the many examples studied so far confirm this ( see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "now let us consider the case when the brauer group of @xmath12 is not trivial .",
    "we take the simplest case where @xmath47 for some integer @xmath48 .",
    "this implies that @xmath49 .",
    "let @xmath50 be a 2-cycle so that @xmath51 $ ] generates this torsion class .",
    "that is , @xmath50 is a cycle such that @xmath52\\cong0 \\:\\leftrightarrow\\ : m \\mathbin{\\rm divides } p.\\ ] ] this implies that @xmath53))^m=1 $ ] , i.e. , @xmath54 ) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i}m\\alpha\\right),\\ ] ] for @xmath55 .",
    "the choice of @xmath56 is required , in addition to @xmath35 , to determine the correlation functions .",
    "that is , the position of the specific a - model in the moduli space of theories is not entirely determined by the complexified khler form but also requires a specification of the discrete parameter @xmath56 .",
    "we may consider the shape of the moduli space of a - models as follows .",
    "the `` large radius limit '' of an a - model is the limit point where the action of all nontrivial instantons becomes infinite .",
    "that is , @xmath22 ) \\to 0 $ ] for @xmath20\\not\\cong0 $ ] ( as always we have @xmath57 ) . at this limit point",
    "therefore the choice of @xmath56 does not matter .",
    "thus different `` sheets '' of the moduli space , each parametrized by @xmath35 but having a different value of @xmath56 , are joined at the large radius limit .",
    "it is important to remember that when describing the moduli space in terms of a - models we assume that we are in the neighbourhood of the large radius limit and that each correlation function is completely determined by a power series centered at the limit point .",
    "thus , we will not discuss further aspects of the global geometry of the moduli space which take us outside this region .",
    "this region of the moduli space is shown in figure [ fig : amod ] .",
    "let us illustrate the new form of the correlation function by an example in which @xmath58 and we are considering observables corresponding to divisors in @xmath12 where @xmath12 is a  threefold . for simplicity let us also assume that @xmath59 so that there is only one such observable .",
    "thus we have @xmath60 .",
    "now we may perform the usual expansion of the a - model correlation functions in terms of the rational curves on @xmath12 as was done in @xcite . in this case",
    "we expect @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a nontrivial cube root of unity .",
    "it is not possible for any algebraic curve to lie in a torsion class of @xmath13 .",
    "this is because the area of an algebraic curve is given by the integral of the khler form over the curve .",
    "this area may be recast as the intersection of a 4-cycle representing the dual of the khler form with the curve .",
    "since any cycle in a torsion class must have zero intersection number with any other cycle , any curve in a torsion class would have zero area , which is not possible .",
    "it may happen however that the difference of two curves is a torsion cycle .",
    "the lines ( i.e. , rational curves intersecting @xmath63 once ) on @xmath12 can therefore lie in one of three homology classes and these are counted by @xmath64 .",
    "the number of lines is thus @xmath65 which is counted by ( [ eq : d3 ] ) in the usual way when @xmath66 .",
    "when @xmath56 is 1 or 2 however we distinguish between these lines .",
    "note that for @xmath67 or 2 the series ( [ eq : d3 ] ) is _ not _ a power series with integer ( or rational ) coefficients .",
    "thus the fact that all examples studied so far did lead to a series with integer coefficients implies that the examples had a trivial brauer group ( or at least , only elements of order 2 ) .",
    "it would be interesting to study an example of a smooth  manifold with non - trivial brauer group and so generate a solid example of the series of the form ( [ eq : d3 ] ) .",
    "unfortunately at this point in time we are not aware of any such examples .",
    "as is well - known ( see , for example , @xcite ) the @xmath68-function for the metric of a non - linear  is given by the ricci - tensor to first order @xmath69 if the target space is at large radius , the later terms in the series are negligible .",
    "consider the flow towards the infra - red ( low - energy ) limit .",
    "if the target space has positive curvature then the sign of the @xmath68-function shows that the space will will shrink under this flow .",
    "if the space has negative curvature it will expand , and if it is ricci - flat then it will be stable ( to leading order ) .",
    "manifolds fall into the last category and thus may provide conformally invariant s.    a complex projective space is a space of positive curvature . the non - linear  on such a space is a massive field theory @xcite and thus navely appears to flow to something trivial in the infra - red limit .",
    "this may be viewed geometrically as a process in which the target space shrinks down to a point in the limit .",
    "actually one needs to be a little careful about this statement .",
    "although one might think that a non - linear  with a point target space is , by its very definition , a trivial theory , one may reach different conclusions by treating the point as a limit point of theories on a complex projective space @xcite . in the latter case",
    "the limit of the infra - red flow is better thought of as a target space whose size is @xmath70 .",
    "this has become a recurring theme in recent works @xcite and may be viewed as part of the inherent difficulty in clearly defining the concept of sizes below the planck scale .",
    "the best method of giving geometrical interpretations to spaces away from the large radius limit is probably that of the linear  of @xcite .",
    "the behaviour of the complex projective space , @xmath71 , as a target space was studied in the latter and gave the following picture which is most complete version of what happens in the infra - red limit .",
    "the linear  contains a real parameter , @xmath72 , which , in the case @xmath73 gives the size of the complex projective target space ( or , to be more precise , the area of complex lines in the target space ) .",
    "the renormalization group acts on this parameter to drive it towards @xmath70 in the i.r .",
    "limit . in this limit",
    "however the geometrical interpretation changes .",
    "when @xmath74 the target space becomes that of @xmath75 disjoint points .",
    "the conformal field theory associated with such a target space has @xmath76 but consists of @xmath75 @xmath77-invariant vacua .",
    "that is , we have a reducible but trivial representation of the virasoro algebra .",
    "this is the sense in which the @xmath71-model flows to a trivial theory in the i.r .",
    "note that this picture preserves the witten index , @xmath78 , or euler characteristic , of the theory during the flow .",
    "the euler characteristic of both @xmath71 and @xmath75 disjoint points is @xmath79 .",
    "we wish now to consider something intermediate between a projective space and a  manifold .",
    "that is , we want a theory which is not conformally invariant but flows to a non - trivial conformal field theory in the infrared limit .",
    "such an example may be provided by blowing - up a smooth point on a  manifold .",
    "blowing up points is familiar in string theory for resolving orbifold singularities ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "blowing up singularities may result in a smooth  manifold . if one blows up a point on a  manifold , @xmath12 , that is already smooth however one obtains a manifold , @xmath80 , which does not admit a ricci - flat metric ( although it is still complex and khler ) .    in the case of a  threefold , blowing up a smooth point",
    "replaces that point by a divisor isomorphic to the projective space @xmath81 .",
    "the normal bundle of this divisor is @xmath82 ( i.e. , the inverse of the hopf bundle ) .",
    "consider a curve @xmath83 which is a projective space @xmath84 lying within this @xmath81 .",
    "it is a simple matter to show that the normal bundle of the curve is @xmath85 . given that its tangent bundle is @xmath86 we obtain @xmath87 thus @xmath88 .",
    "in particular since @xmath89 , the curve @xmath83 will shrink during the flow to the infra - red limit . since all such curves shrink",
    ", the `` exceptional divisor '' @xmath81 will also shrink .",
    "curves away from this blowup will satisfy @xmath90 and should be stable under this flow .",
    "so long as a neighbourhood of such a curve is stable under the flow , the process must lead to a birational transformation and so the complex structure remains fixed .",
    "thus , the net result would appear to be that the limit of this flow is to turn @xmath80 back into @xmath12 .",
    "that is , we take a manifold @xmath12 corresponding to a conformal field theory .",
    "we then perturb it to obtain a field theory that is not conformally invariant , but flows back to the original under flow to the infra - red limit . in other words , _ blowing up a smooth point is equivalent to perturbation by an irrelevant operator_.    it is worth describing an example of this picture in terms of the linear , as we now do for completeness .",
    "the reader who is already convinced of our assertions concerning the effects of the renormalization group may skip this section .",
    "let us consider the case of the quintic hypersurface in @xmath91 .",
    "this is a smooth  manifold . a generic line ( i.e. , linearly embedded @xmath84 ) in the ambient @xmath91 will intersect this  manifold at five distinct points . thus by blowing up such a line we blow up the  manifold at five points .",
    "the toric picture of this blown - up ambient space leads to the following gauged linear . consider seven chiral superfields with lowest components @xmath92 in a theory with gauge group @xmath93 .",
    "the charges are as follows : @xmath94 part of the classical potential comes from the @xmath63-terms of this theory and the vanishing of this requires that two parameters of the theory @xmath95 and @xmath96 be set as follows @xmath97 we also consider the invariant superpotential @xmath98 as in @xcite .",
    "the vanishing of the classical potential requires all of the derivatives of ( [ eq : w ] ) to be zero .",
    "now consider the phase where @xmath99 and @xmath100 . with this choice",
    ", the classical vacuum requires that at least one of @xmath101 does not vanish and that at least one of @xmath102 does not vanish either .",
    "suppose first that @xmath103 .",
    "we may fix the phase of @xmath104 ( we then normalize @xmath105 ) using one of the @xmath106 groups .",
    "the derivatives of the superpotential then require @xmath107 and that @xmath108 let the other @xmath106 action be used to form @xmath109 $ ] as the homogeneous coordinates of @xmath91 ( expressing @xmath91 in the familiar form of a symplectic reduction @xmath110 ) .",
    "thus the classical vacuum appears to be the quintic  hypersurface in @xmath91 .",
    "note however that we are missing the line @xmath111 $ ] and hence 5 points of this  manifold .",
    "now let @xmath112 .",
    "this forces either @xmath113 or @xmath114 to be nonzero and thus @xmath107 .",
    "we also have the constraint @xmath115 from one of the derivatives of the superpotential .",
    "use one of the @xmath106 s to fix the phases of @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the other @xmath106 may be used to form @xmath81 with homogeneous coordinates @xmath116 $ ] .",
    "the result is that each of the 5 points @xmath111 $ ] in the quintic hypersurface have been replaced by @xmath81 .",
    "that is , we have blown - up 5 smooth points as promised .",
    "next consider the phase where @xmath117 and @xmath118 . now",
    "@xmath104 must be nonzero and we fix it using one of the @xmath106 groups .",
    "also one of @xmath119 are nonzero and we use the other @xmath106 to form @xmath91 .",
    "it follows that @xmath107 and we lie on the quintic hypersurface . at first sight therefore , this phase appears to be simply the quintic  manifold in @xmath91 .",
    "this is not the full story however .",
    "thus far we have neglected some of the fields in the theory  namely the lowest components of the twisted chiral superfields coming from the field strength of the two @xmath106 gauge fields .",
    "call these fields @xmath120 and @xmath121 consistent with the notation of @xcite . the classical potential of these fields is given by @xcite : @xmath122 it would appear that for @xmath123 and @xmath124 the fields @xmath125 are very massive and so should be set equal to zero .",
    "it turns out however that there are large quantum corrections to the potential when @xmath126 and @xmath121 appears to be massless .",
    "one may show @xcite that there are @xmath127 extra solutions for @xmath121 when @xmath124 .",
    "our target space for this latter phase is thus as follows .",
    "we have a smooth hypersurface in @xmath91 where the @xmath128 fields are zero and we have a completely disjoint set of 10 points given by the 5 points on the quintic with @xmath129 each with two possible nonzero values for @xmath121 , and @xmath120 is still zero .",
    "note that the euler characteristic of this set is equal to @xmath130 which is precisely that of the quintic blown - up at 5 points .",
    "the effect of the i.r .",
    "flow is to force @xmath131 .",
    "thus if we begin with a target space of the quintic threefold with 5 points blown - up and go to the i.r .",
    "limit , we end up with the quintic threefold with 10 disjoint points .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : blow ] .",
    "note that the resulting conformal field theory consists of that of the quintic together with 10 trivial representations of the virasoro group .",
    "thus it is only when we focus on the nontrivial irreducible part of the conformal field theory that the blow - up is , strictly speaking , an irrelevant operator .",
    "since our main concern in this paper is the behaviour of the correlation functions only in this part of the theory , this meaning of an irrelevant operator is good enough for our purposes .",
    "note also that the complex structure on the target space is unaffected by this process as expected .",
    "let us briefly note that the `` monomial - divisor mirror map '' of @xcite may also be extended to this picture .",
    "this map maps a toric divisor in the target space of the a - model to a monomial which may be used to deform the complex structure of the mirror b - model .",
    "this is done by identifying both the sets of divisors and the set of monomials with a set of points lying in a hyperplane intersecting a lattice based on the ideas of @xcite .",
    "the blow - up of a smooth point can be represented by a point outside this hyperplane , this in turn maps to a monomial with the wrong weight to be considered as part of the original quasi - homogeneous defining equation .",
    "in fact , the monomial s weight is too high and thus is of no importance in the infrared limit as was argued in @xcite .",
    "thus we see again that the blow - up is an irrelevant operator .",
    "presumably given a good definition of the b - model away from criticality , we could understand the meaning of the trivial representations that appear in the i.r .",
    "thus far we have gained little .",
    "we already knew how to handle a non - linear  on a smooth .",
    "where blow - ups prove useful is where they resolve singularities . if the target space @xmath12 is singular then one may study the  by blowing @xmath12 up . depending on the first chern class of the resulting target space",
    "this may be a relevant , marginal or irrelevant perturbation of the original theory . in the case of orbifolds ,",
    "the cases considered are usually marginal ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "one may also have a case of a singularity being resolved by an irrelevant operator as we now show .",
    "consider @xmath132 with coordinates @xmath133 and the hypersurface defined by the equation @xmath134 this hypersurface has an isolated singularity , or `` node , '' at the origin .",
    "there are many ways to remove such a singularity .",
    "consider a compact variety @xmath12 which contains such a node .",
    "the ways in which @xmath12 can be smoothed depend upon the global geometry of @xmath12 .",
    "that is , there may be global obstructions to processes which removed the singularity locally .",
    "whether or not the resulting smooth space is khler is also a global question .",
    "if @xmath12 is a projective algebraic variety then there is always at least one way of smoothing @xmath12 to form a khler manifold , @xmath80 , as follows .",
    "blow up the origin of @xmath132 in which the node ( [ eq : doublept ] ) is embedded .",
    "thus , the origin is replaced by @xmath135 .",
    "the intersection of the hypersurface ( [ eq : doublept ] ) with this @xmath135 is obtained by treating the coordinates @xmath133 as homogeneous coordinates .",
    "thus the effect of the blow - up is to replace the node by a quadric hypersurface in @xmath135 .",
    "it is a well - known result in algebraic geometry that such a complex 2-fold is isomorphic to @xmath136 .",
    "now consider the first chern class of this blow - up .",
    "let @xmath83 by any one of the two families of rational curves in the exceptional divisor @xmath136 . clearly",
    "because of the product structure , the normal bundle of this curve within the exceptional divisor is @xmath137 .",
    "the other normal direction of the curve is that of the way @xmath135 embeds in @xmath132 .",
    "thus the total normal bundle of the curve is @xmath138 . adding this to the tangent bundle we obtain @xmath139 this is thus similar to the case of a blow - up of a smooth point  the blow - up is an irrelevant operator .",
    "in contrast to the latter case however , the irrelevant perturbation has been of some use  we have smoothed the target space .",
    "we are now in a position to study some examples for the target space which exhibit stable singularities thanks to the analysis of the preceding sections .",
    "let @xmath141 be a smooth hypersurface in @xmath135 defined by an equation of degree 8 in the homogeneous coordinates .",
    "let @xmath142 be a double cover of this @xmath135 branched over @xmath141 .",
    "the space @xmath142 is a smooth  manifold and was studied in the physics literature long ago @xcite .",

    "see figure [ fig : eg1 ] ( where only 2 of the 80 nodes are shown ) .",
    "the space @xmath80 is smooth and khler but not .",
    "as shown in the appendix however , this space is very interesting for our purposes because @xmath156 contains a @xmath157 subgroup .",

    "that is , we ignore the contributions to the homology appearing from the exceptional divisors themselves .",
    "what we do not ignore however is the torsion in @xmath156 because this may be observed away from the exceptional divisors .",
    "in particular there are rational curves @xmath158 such that @xmath159-[c_2]$ ] is a nontrivial element of @xmath160 and neither @xmath161 nor @xmath162 is contained in any of the exceptional divisors .",
    "we propose therefore that one may define an a - model on @xmath12 in terms of the homology classes on @xmath80 excluding classes lying exclusively within the exceptional divisors .",
    "this means that our @xmath157 group in the brauer group allows us to introduce a parameter @xmath56 which may be 0 or 1 as in section [ s : amod ] .",

    "this is all well and good if @xmath66 but if @xmath67 then we are in trouble .",
    "the coefficients in the a - model correlation functions appear to jump as the homology classes of @xmath161 and @xmath162 change .",
    "thus , an a - model on @xmath12 for which the parameter @xmath56 is @xmath163 may possibly be deformed into an a - model on @xmath164 , but for a - models with @xmath67 this deformation appears to be obstructed at the level of correlation functions . since this deformation is the only way of smoothing @xmath12 into a  manifold , if @xmath67 then we are unable to follow the a - model from the singular space to the smooth one .",

    "thus @xmath177 may be taken to be the geometrical interpretation of a conformal field marginally perturbed from that of the orbifold @xmath172 with trivial 2-cocycle .",
    "when the nontrivial 2-cocycle is chosen , one obtains a chiral ring mirror to that with a trivial 2-cocycle .",
    "that is , @xmath182 and @xmath190 .",
    "these numbers precisely agree with the degrees of freedom of @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath12 has 3 deformations of its `` khler form , '' that is , the sizes of the three @xmath84 s may be varied .",
    "( @xmath12 itself is singular so it does nt really have a khler form as such . )",
    "varying @xmath146 gives @xmath145 30 deformations of complex structure but this does not actually account for all the deformations of @xmath145 which preserve the 64 nodes . since @xmath142 has 115 deformations there will be @xmath191 deformations of @xmath145 maintaining 64 nodes and thus 51 deformations of @xmath80 .",
    "thus there are 51 deformations of complex structure for @xmath12 for our purposes .",
    "as the reader may have guessed by now , the group @xmath156 contains a @xmath157 torsion part .",
    "thus by analogous reasoning to the previous example , if we set @xmath67 for the a - model on @xmath12 , we obstruct the deformations taking @xmath12 into @xmath142 .",
    "this then appears to give the correct geometrical picture for allowing @xmath12 to be regarded as the geometrical interpretation of a conformal field theory marginally perturbed from that of the orbifold @xmath172 with nontrivial 2-cocycle .",
    "note however that in addition to just knowing the classical geometry of @xmath12 , we also need to put @xmath67 to stop @xmath142 from providing the geometrical interpretation .",
    "we have observed that conformal field theory , or topological field theory , on a target space with nodes may have degrees of freedom which are `` hidden away '' in the nodes . by perturbing by an irrelevant operator we have been able to probe the secrets of these nodes to discover the brauer group at work .",
    "it is important to realize in the above description that the hidden degrees of freedom can not be expressed as some local property of each of the nodes .",
    "the appearance of torsion in @xmath156 is a global property  many nodes in just the right place are required to produce the element of the brauer group on blowing up .",
    "this demonstrates further some of the peculiar properties of the stringy description of space .",

    "consider the conformal field theory on the manifold @xmath142 in the example in either section [ ss : eg1 ] or [ ss : eg2 ] and consider the process of deforming the target space continuously to @xmath12 .",
    "such a degeneration of complex structure leads to infinities in the chiral ring .",
    "that is , the b - model on @xmath142 appears bad in the limit @xmath192 .",
    "this appears to rule out a good conformal field theory corresponding to the a - model with @xmath66 . for the case",
    "@xmath67 we have removed precisely the offending fields from the b - model causing the divergences .",
    "thus the case @xmath67 contains no infinities and may describe a good conformal field theory .",
    "this agrees with the analysis of @xcite where there are only two choices of orbifold theories on @xmath172 .",
    "one consists of the theory which may be blown up to @xmath177 .",
    "the other is the theory which is deformed to @xmath12 with @xmath67 .",
    "there is no third possibility of a theory which may be deformed to @xmath12 with @xmath66 since such a theory would be a limit of @xmath142 and , as such , contain divergences .",
    "thus although we have introduced the brauer group as an extra parameter in the space of a - models , it would appear that to obtain a finite conformal field theory on a singular space such as @xmath12 , one is forced to rule out the choice @xmath66 .",
    "presumably it is only on smooth manifolds that one is really free to choose @xmath56 .",
    "the example in section [ ss : eg2 ] appears to show a link between elements of the brauer group and nontrivial 2-cocycles for orbifolds .",
    "the imposition of a ( non)trivial 2-cocycle for the orbifold @xmath172 appears to match the ( non)trivial choice for @xmath56 for the theory on @xmath12 .",
    "can we therefore claim to have a complete geometrical understanding of these 2-cocycles ?",
    "unfortunately the picture is not complete .",
    "it is not possible to blow - up @xmath172 to obtain some manifold with nontrivial brauer group .",

    "the result is that the mirror of @xmath177 is a hybrid model which is a `` trivial '' ( i.e. , quadratic ) landau - ginzburg theory in @xmath195 fibred over @xmath180 .",
