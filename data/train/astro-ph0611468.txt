    "given that turbulent motions ( velocities ) are inherently stochastic , velocity field statistics are an essential tool for extracting its physical properties . in 1941",
    "kolmogorov @xcite published his theory ( hereafter k41 ) on the local velocity field structure of turbulence for incompressible hydrodynamic ( hereafter ihd ) fluids with high reynolds numbers , in which he hypothesized the existence of homogeneity , isotropy , and an inertial range ( hereafter k41 ) .",
    "the inertial range in the kinetic energy spectrum is a range in wave number , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the separation length between two points often regarded as the eddie size , which lies between the typical large scales and the dissipative scales and is therefore independent of external input such as turbulence drive or output such as dissipation @xcite . in this range",
    "the spectrum is also independent of viscosity and exhibits a power - law dependence of the form e(k)=k@xmath3@xmath4 , where k is the universal kolmogorov constant and @xmath5 is the average rate of energy dissipation per unit mass .",
    "it is known that the inclusion of an external magnetic field in the turbulence of an incompressible fluid brings about many substantial complications and can drastically modify the turbulent motions .",
    "the inclusion of compressibility also causes significant changes in the properties of turbulence .",
    "gotoh , fukayama , & nakano @xcite thoroughly and successfully investigated the velocity field statistics of high - resolution direct numerical simulations for ihd turbulence .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to address the question , are the velocity field statistics completely different from ihd when a magnetic field and compressibility are included ?",
    "we extend the analysis of gotoh et al .",
    "@xcite to incompressible magnetohydrodynamic ( hereafter imhd ) and compressible magnetohydrodynamic ( hereafter cmhd ) turbulence in an attempt to answer this question .",
    "this is considered mostly through the use of high order scaling exponents of the velocity structure functions .",
    "emphasis is also placed on the differences between the scaling exponents of longitudinal and transverse structure functions . for high order scaling exponents the findings of gotoh et al .",
    "@xcite are confirmed for structure functions measured in the global reference frame for ihd turbulence . scaling exponents",
    "are then explored for imhd and cmhd turbulence in the global frame and the local frame , defined by the local mean magnetic field .",

    "the ihd data used in this study came from simulations with a grid size of @xmath6 . for both mhd models , a high resolution grid size of @xmath7 was used and the external magnetic field is in the positive x - direction .",

    "we have adopted a pseudospectral code to solve the incompressible mhd equations in a periodic box of size @xmath9 : @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a random driving force , @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the velocity , and @xmath16 is magnetic field divided by @xmath17 . in this representation , @xmath15 can be viewed as the velocity measured in units of the r.m.s .",
    "velocity , v , of the system and @xmath16 as the alfvn speed in the same units .",
    "the time @xmath18 is in units of the large eddy turnover time ( @xmath19 ) and the length in units of @xmath20 , the inverse wavenumber of the fundamental box mode . in this system of units ,",
    "the viscosity @xmath21 and magnetic diffusivity @xmath22 are the inverse of the kinetic and magnetic reynolds numbers respectively .",
    "the magnetic field consists of the uniform background field and a fluctuating field : @xmath23 .",
    "we use 21 forcing components with @xmath24 , where wavenumber @xmath25 is in units of @xmath26 .",
    "each forcing component has correlation time of one .",
    "the peak of energy injection occurs at @xmath27 .",
    "the amplitudes of the forcing components are tuned to ensure @xmath28 .",
    "we use exactly the same forcing terms for all simulations .",
    "the alfvn velocity of the uniform background field , @xmath29 , is set to 1 .",
    "we consider only cases where viscosity is equal to magnetic diffusivity : @xmath30 in pseudo spectral methods , the temporal evolution of equations ( [ veq ] ) and ( [ beq ] ) are followed in fourier space . to obtain the fourier components of nonlinear terms ,",
    "we first calculate them in real space , and transform back into fourier space .",
    "the average kinetic helicity in these simulations is not zero .",
    "however , previous tests have shown that our results are insensitive to the value of the kinetic helicity . in incompressible fluid",
    ", @xmath31 is not an independent variable .",

    "the magnetic field has only its uniform component and the velocity field is restricted to the range @xmath36 in wavevector space .",
    "hyperviscosity and hyperdiffusivity are used for the dissipation terms .",

    "cho & lazarian @xcite can be referenced for more details on the above discussion .",
    "we use a third - order accurate hybrid essentially non - oscillatory ( eno ) scheme ( see @xcite ) to solve the ideal isothermal mhd equations in a periodic box : @xmath42 with @xmath43 and an isothermal equation of state . here",

    "we assume that @xmath49 .",
    "the sound speed is one therefore the resulting mach number and plasma @xmath50 are of order unity .",
    "as is the case with other finite - difference numerical schemes , our compressible mhd code inherits numerical viscosity ( and diffusion ) , which results in energy dissipation on small scales .",
    "see @xcite for details on the above discussion .",
    "the three - dimensional kinetic energy spectrum for each model , taken after turbulence has reached a statistically stationary state , is shown in figure [ spec ] .",
    "the inertial range of the spectrum is of most interest for this study .",
    "the shape of the curves at wave numbers less than those of the inertial range depends on the energy at the injection scale and how the turbulent motions are excited .",
    "the shape of the curves at wave numbers greater than those of the inertial range is affected significantly by viscosity , the bottleneck effect @xcite , and the resolution of the model . despite the fact that the kolmogorov phenomenology , e(k)@xmath51@xmath4 , is derived for ihd , in the inertial range all three curves demonstrate a very similar power law dependence , suggesting that the energy transfer process is consistent over this range of wave numbers .",
    "this may be surprising considering the many changes resulting from the inclusion of a magnetic field , such as an alfvenic mode propagating parallel to the magnetic field and elongation of the structures in the velocity field .",
    "the inclusion of compressibility introduces significant changes as well , such as shocks .",
    "goldreich & sridhar @xcite provide an explanation of this behavior .",
    "see @xcite also for a review .",
    "deviations from the @xmath52 law have become an issue of debate ( see @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "we do not address this issue here .",
    "the probability distribution function ( hereafter pdf ) is used to obtain information about one - point velocity statistics ( see @xcite for detailed discussions on astrophysical applications ) .",
    "the single - point pdf s of different components of the velocity field for each model shown in figure [ pdf ] are histograms , normalized to the grid size , of the values of the velocity at each point . for the ihd model the x , y , and",
    "z components were averaged .",
    "for the two mhd models , the histograms were separated into components parallel ( x direction ) and perpendicular ( y & z directions ) to the external magnetic field , ( @xmath53 ) ; therefore , the pdf s for the x components are presented separately and the y and z components are averaged .",
    "the pdf for the ihd model is somewhat asymmetric .",
    "any asymmetry or skewness in the pdf s should disappear when averaged over multiple time steps @xcite .",
    "the pdf s of the mhd simulations parallel to @xmath53 are similar to each other , fairly symmetric , wider toward the top than a gaussian , and at large amplitudes decay faster than a gaussian .",
    "their slopes are the steepest of the pdf s presented and given that the area under the curve must be the same , their ranges of velocities are smaller . for imhd turbulence",
    "the divergence of the velocity vector is zero meaning that there are no sources , sinks , or shocks and that only eddies can exist .",
    "this is not the case for cmhd simulations in which shocks are produced at high velocities which dissipate the energy perhaps contributing to the pdf of the parallel cmhd model having the least high velocity points .",
    "the pdf s of the imhd and cmhd models perpendicular to @xmath53 approximately follow each other and are even more similar to each other than the parallel components .",
    "they are very symmetric and gaussian - like , have the most shallow slopes of all , and therefore have the most high velocity points .",
    "when an external magnetic field is introduced into the turbulent motions , an alfvenic mode is produced with perturbations perpendicular to the direction of the field .",
    "this additional contribution to the velocity is responsible for the higher velocities found in the perpendicular pdf s .",
    "the additional kinetic energy given to the perpendicular direction explains the separation of these two components seen in the top of figure [ pdf ] .",
    "this appears to be equally valid for both positive and negative values of the velocity .",
    "an average over 10 time steps of the velocity pdf s for a cmhd simulation with 256 resolution was performed .",
    "the 10 parallel time steps were averaged as well as the 20 perpendicular time steps , 10 for y and 10 for z. these pdf s are plotted in figure [ pdf_error ] along with the cmhd pdf s mentioned above .",
    "the pdf s are normalized to match their maxima in order to better compare their tails .",
    "the parallel and perpendicular pdf s for the single time step lie sufficiently close to the expected random errors obtained from the pdf s averaged over multiple time steps to justify using a single time step and averaging the perpendicular components .",
    "figures [ pdf_derx ] and [ pdf_dery ] show pdf s of the transverse increments of the velocity field which are histograms , normalized to the grid size , of the values of the difference between the velocity field at each point and the field at an adjacent point along the direction specified .",
    "positive values suggests that @xmath54 is increasing in the positive direction while negative values suggest that it is decreasing . in figure [ pdf_derx ]",
    "the increments of the x - component of the velocity field taken along the y and z directions , parallel to @xmath53 for the mhd models , are averaged .",
    "figure [ pdf_dery ] shows the increments of the y - component along the x and z directions .",
    "the results are not averaged given that one is parallel to @xmath53 while the other is perpendicular .",
    "in both figures , all three models demonstrate near perfect symmetry .",
    "this is true despite the orientation with respect to @xmath53 . in figure [ pdf_dery ] as expected for the ihd model , x and z are nearly identical because there is no magnetic field to bring about differences . on the other hand for the mhd models , x extends to higher values of the velocity increment than z.    because of the fact that the difference in range between the x components for the imhd and cmhd models is much greater than the difference in range between the z components for the imhd and cmhd models , it is possible that most of the increase in range in going from imhd models to cmhd models by introducing compressibility is coming from the components parallel to @xmath53 .",
    "this is supported by the fact that for the pdf s in figure [ pdf ] the perpendicular components follow each other closely while the parallel components are quite different from each other .",
    "structure functions are used to obtain information about two - point velocity statistics .",
    "structure functions describe the distribution of velocity structures of size @xmath2 and are defined as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a velocity increment and @xmath57 represents ensemble averaging .",
    "structure functions are defined with the absolute value of the velocity increment to ensure their positivity for all orders .",
    "structure functions are separated into a longitudinal component naturally defined by the velocity increment @xmath58\\cdot\\hat{l } ,   \\label{eqn : vel_incr}\\ ] ] and transverse components @xmath59 chosen randomly in the plane perpendicular to the longitudinal component . when higher order structure functions are used the pdf tails contribute more , where as you can see in figure [ pdf_error ] the errors are much larger .    for each separation length @xmath2 from 1 to 128 , @xmath56 is calculated at 100,000 points randomly distributed throughout the entire periodic velocity field . in the global reference frame the direction of @xmath60 , or the direction of the longitudinal structure function , is also random .",
    "the structure functions for the ihd model are calculated in the global reference frame . for the mhd models",
    "@xmath60 can be chosen randomly ( global frame ) , parallel to the local mean magnetic field , or perpendicular to the local mean field .",
    "it is well known that , for mhd turbulence in a strongly magnetized medium energy cascade occurs mainly in the direction perpendicular to the mean field in the fourier space , which makes eddies elongated @xcite along the global mean magnetic field .",
    "however , according to @xcite and @xcite , for mhd turbulence in a strongly magnetized medium eddies are not aligned along the direction of the total mean field but rather are aligned along the local mean field .",
    "this being the case , the local mean field is the physically relevant background for the eddie dynamics .",
    "the local frame is separated into two types which are represented in figure [ local_explan ] . in ( a ) the points from which the structure functions are calculated",
    "are chosen along the local mean field , this configuration will be referred to as local parallel . in",
    "( b ) the points are chosen in the plane perpendicular to the local mean field , this configuration will be referred to as local perpendicular .",
    "figure [ sfs ] shows the second order longitudinal , transverse , and total structure functions of the velocity field .",
    "the column on the left is the global frame , the middle column is the local parallel frame , and the column on the right is the local perpendicular frame . in the local frames the structure functions of the ihd model calculated in the global frame are shown for comparison .",
    "the inertial range of the turbulent motions manifests itself in the structure functions as the range of @xmath2 over which the slope is constant in a log - log plot .",
    "the first maximum of a structure function is related to the size of the largest structures in the corresponding field , the radius of the largest eddies for example",
    ". it will be found at the separation length at which the largest @xmath56 is observed .",
    "we confirm the result of @xcite that in the global frame for ihd turbulence the values of the transverse structure functions are greater than those of the longitudinal . in extending our analysis to imhd and cmhd",
    "we find that the structure functions of both mhd models in the global and local perpendicular reference frames exhibit this behavior as well .",
    "for each mhd model in the local parallel reference frame the values of the longitudinal and transverse structure functions are very similar . in the global and local parallel frames the imhd structure functions are greater than those of the cmhd model at lower values of the separation length where they appear more like the ihd structure functions in the global frame . in summary ,",
    "the mhd models in the global frame and in the plane perpendicular to the local mean field are significantly more similar to the ihd structure functions than the structure functions of the mhd models in the local parallel frame .",
    "also , the shapes of the structure functions in the global and local parallel frames for the imhd model are more like that of the ihd model than the cmhd model is .",
    "self - similarity or scale - invariance implies that fluid turbulence at larger scales can be reproduced by the magnification of turbulent motions at smaller scales . at",
    "the dissipation scales self similarity fails as turbulence forms non - gaussian dissipation structures @xcite .",
    "self - similarity is even an approximation in the inertial range where turbulent motions become increasingly sparse in space and time at smaller scales , a property known as intermittency . in 1962",
    "kolmogorov published a modification of his 1941 theory including the effects of intermittency or scale - variance @xcite .",
    "one way to investigate intermittency is by studying the scaling exponents of velocity fluctuations in the inertial range , given that for a scale - invariant flow the scaling exponents are linear functions of the order of the structure functions .    despite the fact that the origin is not yet fully understood ,",
    "the scaling behavior of structure functions is very useful and interesting ( see @xcite for a comprehensive discussion on astrophysical situations ; see also @xcite ) . within the inertial range , a structure function of arbitrary order scales with the separation length @xmath2 as @xmath61 . from this scaling relation and a few transformations self - similarity between two structure functions of arbitrary orders , @xmath62 and @xmath63 ,",
    "can be obtained : @xmath64^{\\zeta(p)/\\zeta(p ' ) } } ,   \\label{eqn : sf_relation}\\ ] ] demonstrating how the structure functions @xmath65 and @xmath66 are related ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it also brings to light the possibility of using a structure function of an arbitrary order @xmath63 as a normalization . in figure [ selfsim ] the sixth order longitudinal structure function is plotted as a function of the third order longitudinal structure function where @xmath60 is parallel to the local mean magnetic field , demonstrating how self similarity can be used to obtain scaling exponents .",
    "a minimum chi - square linear fit was used to determine @xmath67 .",
    "the scaling relation @xmath68 in the inertial range has been derived analytically in kolmogorov phenomenology yielding @xmath69 .",
    "for this reason the third moment is used as the normalization .",

    "@xcite showed that the velocity field for subsonic mhd turbulence follows sl1 , while for highly supersonic mhd turbulence it follows sl2 .",

    "the global scaling exponents are also presented in figures [ ses_loc_para ] and [ ses_loc_perp ] for comparison , given that the local reference frame has no meaning without a magnetic field . despite the fact that the error in the scaling exponents increases with order from the increasing fluctuation in the structure functions",
    ", emphasis is placed on high order structure functions ( @xmath83 ) given that at low orders the theoretical predictions considered here differentiate themselves very little .    beginning with figure [ ses_global ] in the global reference frame",
    "the longitudinal scaling exponents of all three models follow sl1 quite well . in the transverse case",

    "the imhd model follows sl2 quite well while the cmhd model is between the two .",
    "the ihd results mentioned here agree with those obtained by @xcite in that for @xmath83 the longitudinal scaling exponents fall slightly below sl1 while the transverse exponents are significantly lower . for all three models ,",
    "despite the fact that the longitudinal scaling exponents follow sl1 much better than the transverse follow sl2 , the scaling exponents calculated from the total structure functions are much more sl2-like than sl1-like for all three models .",
    "their behavior is very similar to the transverse case , suggesting that the transverse scaling exponents have a significantly larger amplitude than the longitudinal , which can be seen to be true in figure [ sfs ] .",
    "the same holds for figures [ ses_loc_para ] and [ ses_loc_perp ] .    in figure [ ses_loc_para ] in the local parallel reference frame for the longitudinal component , parallel to the local mean magnetic field in this case",

    "is found for all three models at all values of @xmath62 .",
    "for the transverse component , also perpendicular to the local mean magnetic field in this case , we do not find a similar agreement ; the imhd model is more sl2-like while the cmhd model remains in between .",
    "we confirm the results of @xcite that for ihd turbulence the transverse scaling exponents , @xmath85 are less than the longitudinal @xmath86 for orders greater than four . in extending the analysis to incompressible and compressible mhd turbulence",
    "we find that in the global reference frame and in the local perpendicular reference frame this behavior continues .",
    "this is not necessarily the case in the local parallel reference frame .",
    "this difference is probably related to the fact that in the local parallel frame the longitudinal component necessarily probes the direction parallel to the local mean field while the transverse component probes the plane perpendicular to the local mean field , thus incorporating a consistent difference between the two components that does not exist in the other two frames .    the most conspicuous sl1 cases above are both longitudinal , namely @xmath87 and @xmath88 in which all models follow sl1 suggesting physically that the dissipation structures are one dimensional hydrodynamic - like vortices .",
    "the most conspicuous sl2 cases are both the transverse cases corresponding to the longitudinal sl1 cases above , namely @xmath89 and @xmath90 in which the imhd model mostly follows sl2 suggesting physically that the dissipation structures are two dimensional sheets dominated by mhd processes .",
    "it is possible and perhaps more likely that the dissipation structures only appear one or two dimensional in slices of the three dimensional mhd turbulence @xcite",
    ". the cases in which the scaling exponents fall in between sl1 and sl2 may be some mixture of the two physical pictures .",
    "also , in the global reference frame and in the local perpendicular reference frame the mhd models are similar . in these two cases",
    "it seems that the dissipation structures are similar for incompressible and compressible mhd turbulence .",
    "hd and mhd turbulence are similar over high order longitudinal scaling exponents measured in the global reference frame as well as for motions perpendicular to the local mean field . in the local magnetic system the motions parallel to the local mean field for both mhd models are different from hydrodynamic motions .",

    "the velocity fields can be decomposed into these three components and scaling exponents for each component can be obtained , as explained in @xcite .",
    "figure [ decomp_explan ] gives a pictorial representation of the decomposition method @xcite .",

    "this is the only case where the transverse component is significantly greater than the longitudinal component .",
    "the transverse component follows sl2 while the longitudinal component falls well below sl2 .",
    "there are three cases in which scaling exponents fall well below sl2 , namely the cmhd longitudinal component of @xmath91 , the transverse component for both models of @xmath92 , and the cmhd longitudinal component of @xmath93 , suggesting that intermittency is greater in these cases .",

    "this is the case for @xmath99 and @xmath93 , which is in direct agreement with the conspicuous cases mentioned in the discussion of figures [ ses_global ] through [ ses_loc_perp ] . combining the results of figures",
    "[ ses_global ] and [ decompses_glo ] it seems that in the global reference frame the alfvenic mode is mostly responsible for the fact that the longitudinal components of both mhd models follow sl1 .",
    "for the imhd model both the alfvenic and slow modes seem to contribute significantly to the fact that the transverse components appear to follow sl2 . combining the results of figures [ ses_loc_perp ] and [ decompses_loc_perp ]",

    "it is also true that for the decomposed scaling exponents of the two mhd models the longitudinal components are more alike than the transverse components , in every case except for @xmath93 .",
    "this makes sense in the local parallel reference frame where there is a bias in that the longitudinal components are chosen in the direction of the local mean field while the transverse components are chosen randomly to be perpendicular to the longitudinal components , but this observation also holds in the global reference frame where there is no bias because the longitudinal components are chosen randomly .",
    "if the dissipation structures are similar for compressible and incompressible mhd then it is possible that the longitudinal scaling exponents would do a better job of probing this .",
    "in this paper turbulence in an incompressible fluid with and without a magnetic field as well as moderately compressible mhd turbulence are considered .",
    "we summarize our findings as follows :    1 .",
    "substantial similarity was shown between the spectra for all three models .",
    "the pdf s of the velocity components perpendicular to the external magnetic field are ihd - like while those parallel to the field have a significantly smaller range of velocities .",
    "the pdf s of the transverse velocity increments for the mhd models decay slower than the ihd model .",
    "the structure functions of the mhd models in the global frame and in the plane perpendicular to the local mean field are ihd - like in that the values of the transverse structure functions are greater than those of the longitudinal . in these two frames",
    "the shapes of the structure functions of the imhd model are more ihd - like than the cmhd model .",
    "the similarity of hd , imhd , and cmhd turbulence persists over high order longitudinal structure function scaling exponents measured in the global reference frame as well as for motions perpendicular to the local mean field . in these two frames",
    "the longitudinal scaling exponents of both mhd models seem to follow the predictions for one dimensional ihd - like dissipations structures while the transverse scaling exponents of the imhd model seems to follow the predictions for two dimensional imhd - like dissipation structures . in the local magnetic system",
    "the motions parallel to the local mean field for both mhd models are different from hydrodynamic motions .",
    "5 .   in the global reference frame and for motions perpendicular to the local mean field",
    "the alfvenic mode is mostly responsible for the fact that the longitudinal components of both mhd models follow the ihd model and the ihd theoretical dissipation structure predictions . in the global reference frame for the imhd model both the alfvenic and slow",
    "modes seem to contribute significantly to the fact that the transverse components follow the imhd theoretical predictions . for motions",
    "perpendicular to the magnetic field for the imhd model the slow mode seems to contribute most to the fact that the transverse component seems to follow the imhd theoretical predictions .",
    "it is also true that for the decomposed scaling exponents of the two mhd models the longitudinal components are more alike than the transverse components , in every case except for the slow mode in the plane perpendicular to the local mean field .",
