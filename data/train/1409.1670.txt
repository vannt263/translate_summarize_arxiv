    "the referenced works use a variety of methods , often ad hoc , to study representations .",

    ", they will be applicable to many categories not yet considered .    in the remainder of the introduction",
    ", we summarize our results and applications in more detail . see  [ sec : intro - guide ] for a guide for the paper .      given an object @xmath22 of @xmath0 ,",
    "define a representation @xmath23 of @xmath0 by @xmath24 $ ] , i.e. , @xmath25 is the free @xmath2-module with basis @xmath26 .",
    "we call @xmath23 the * principal projective * at @xmath22 .",
    "these representations take the place of free modules ; in fact , one should think of @xmath23 as the free representation with one generator of degree @xmath22 .",
    "a representation of @xmath0 is * finitely generated * if it is a quotient of a finite direct sum of principal projective representations .",
    "the category @xmath27 of representations of @xmath0 is called * noetherian * if any subrepresentation of a finitely generated representation is again finitely generated .",
    "this is a fundamental property , and has played a crucial role in applications .",
    "the first main theoretical result of this paper is a combinatorial criterion on @xmath0 that ensures @xmath27 is noetherian , for any left - noetherian ring @xmath2 .",
    "we now explain this criterion , and the motivation behind it .",
    "we start by recalling a combinatorial proof of the hilbert basis theorem ( i.e. , @xmath28 $ ] is a noetherian ring ) using grbner bases .",
    "pick an admissible order on the monomials , i.e. , a well - order compatible with multiplication . using the order",
    ", we can define initial ideals , and reduce the study of the ascending chain condition to monomial ideals .",
    "now , the set of monomial ideals is naturally in bijection with the set of ideals in the poset @xmath29 .",
    "thus noetherianity of @xmath28 $ ] follows from noetherianity of the poset @xmath29 ( dickson s lemma ) , which is a simple combinatorial exercise : given infinitely many vectors @xmath30 in @xmath29 , there exists @xmath31 with @xmath32 , where @xmath33 means coordinate - by - coordinate comparison .    to apply this method to @xmath27 we must first make sense of what `` monomials '' are .",
    "the * monomials * are the basis elements @xmath34 for @xmath35 . a subrepresentation @xmath36 of @xmath23 is * monomial * if @xmath37 is spanned by the monomials it contains , for all @xmath38 .",
    "we now carry over the combinatorial proof of the hilbert basis theorem .",
    "for simplicity of exposition , we assume that @xmath0 is directed , i.e. , if @xmath39 then @xmath40 . for an object @xmath22 of @xmath0 , we write @xmath41 for the set of isomorphism classes of morphisms",
    "this can be thought of as the set of monomials in @xmath23 .",
    "suppose that @xmath0 satisfies the following condition :    * for each @xmath43 , the set @xmath41 admits an admissible order @xmath44 , that is , a well - order compatible with post - composition , i.e. , @xmath45 implies @xmath46 for all @xmath47 .",
    "given a subrepresentation @xmath36 of a principal projective @xmath23 , we can use @xmath44 to define the * initial representation * @xmath48 .",
    "this allows us to reduce the study of the ascending chain condition for subrepresentations of @xmath23 to monomial subrepresentations .",
    "monomial subrepresentations are naturally in bijection with ideals in the poset @xmath41 , where the order is defined by @xmath49 if @xmath50 for some @xmath51 .",
    "( note : @xmath44 and @xmath33 are two different orders on @xmath41 ; the former is chosen , while the latter is canonical . )",
    "we now assume that @xmath0 satisfies one further condition :    * for each @xmath43 , the poset @xmath41 is noetherian .    given this ,",
    "ascending chains of monomial subrepresentations stabilize , and so @xmath23 is noetherian .",
    "one easily deduces from this that @xmath27 is a noetherian category .",
    "the above discussion motivates one of the main definitions in this paper :    a directed category @xmath0 is * grbner * if ( g1 ) and ( g2 ) hold .",
    "we can summarize the previous paragraph as : if @xmath0 is a directed grbner category then @xmath27 is noetherian . in the body of the paper",
    ", we give a definition of grbner that does not require directed .",
    "however , it still precludes non - trivial automorphisms , and hence many of the categories of primary interest .",
    "this motivates a weakening of the above definition :    a category @xmath0 is * quasi - grbner * if there is a grbner category @xmath52 and an essentially surjective functor @xmath53 satisfying property  ( f ) ( see definition  [ def : propf ] ) .",
    "property  ( f ) is a finiteness condition that intuitively means @xmath52 locally has finite index in @xmath0 .",
    "our main combinatorial criterion for noetherianity is the following theorem :    if @xmath0 is quasi - grbner and @xmath2 is left - noetherian , then @xmath27 is noetherian .",
    "this is a solution of an instance of the main problem : `` ( quasi-)grbner '' is a purely combinatorial condition on @xmath0 , which can be checked easily in practice , and the above theorem connects it to an important algebraic property of representations .",
    "recall that @xmath3 is the category whose objects are finite sets and whose morphisms are injections .",
    "the automorphism groups in this category are symmetric groups , so @xmath3 is not grbner .",
    "define @xmath54 to be the category whose objects are totally ordered finite sets and whose morphisms are order - preserving injections .",
    "we show that @xmath54 is a grbner category ( theorem  [ oithm ] ) and the forgetful functor @xmath55 shows that @xmath3 is quasi - grbner . in particular , we see that @xmath56 is noetherian for any left - noetherian ring @xmath2 .",
    "see remark  [ rmk : fi - noeth ] for the history of this result and its generalizations .",
    "the above example is a typical application of the theory of grbner categories : the main category of interest ( in this case @xmath3 ) has automorphisms , and is therefore not grbner .",
    "one therefore adds extra structure ( e.g. , a total order ) to obtain a more rigid category .",
    "one then shows that this rigidified category is grbner , which usually comes down to an explicit combinatorial problem ( in this case , dickson s lemma ) .",
    "finally , one deduces that the original category is quasi - grbner , which is usually quite easy .",
    "a * norm * on a category @xmath0 is a function @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the set of isomorphism classes of @xmath0 .",
    "suppose that @xmath0 is equipped with a norm and @xmath36 is a representation of @xmath0 over a field @xmath2 .",
    "we then define the * hilbert series * of @xmath36 by @xmath59 when this makes sense , i.e. , when the coefficient of @xmath60 is finite for all @xmath61 .",
    "the second main theoretical result of this paper is a combinatorial condition on @xmath62 that ensures @xmath63 has a particular form , for any finitely generated representation @xmath36 .",
    "the key idea is to connect to the theory of formal languages .",
    "let @xmath64 be a finite set , and let @xmath65 denote the set of all finite words in @xmath64 ( i.e. , the free monoid generated by @xmath64 ) .",
    "a * language * on @xmath64 is a subset of @xmath65 .",
    "given a language @xmath66 , we define its * hilbert series * by @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the length of the word @xmath69 .",
    "there are many known results on hilbert series of languages : for example , regular languages have rational hilbert series and unambiguous context - free languages have algebraic hilbert series ( chomsky  schtzenberger theorem ) .",
    "we review these results , and establish some new ones , in ",
    "[ s : lang ] .",
    "let @xmath70 be a class of languages .",
    "a * @xmath70-lingual structure * on @xmath0 at @xmath22 consists of a finite alphabet @xmath64 and an injection @xmath71 ( i.e. , a way of regarding monomials in @xmath23 as words ) such that the following two conditions hold .",
    "first , for any @xmath35 in @xmath41 we have @xmath72 , that is , the norm of a monomial coincides with the length of the corresponding word . and",
    "second , if @xmath73 is a poset ideal of @xmath41 then the language @xmath74 is of class @xmath70 .",
    "we say that @xmath0 is * @xmath70-lingual * if it admits a @xmath70-lingual structure at every object .",
    "a special case of our main result on hilbert series is then :    suppose that @xmath0 is a @xmath70-lingual grbner category and let @xmath36 be a finitely generated representation of @xmath0 .",
    "then @xmath75 is a @xmath76-linear combination of series of the form @xmath77 , where each @xmath66 is a language of class @xmath70 .",
    "this too is a solution of an instance of the main problem : `` @xmath70-lingual '' is a purely combinatorial condition on @xmath62 , which can be easily checked in practice , and the above theorem connects it to an important algebraic property of representations .",
    "define a norm on @xmath54 by @xmath78 .",
    "we show that @xmath79 is @xmath70-lingual , where @xmath70 is the class of `` ordered languages '' introduced in ",
    "[ ss : ordered ] ; we refer to theorem  [ oithm ] for the details . as a consequence ,",
    "if @xmath36 is a finitely generated @xmath3-module then @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a polynomial and @xmath82 , and so the function @xmath83)$ ] is eventually polynomial .",
    "see remark  [ rmk : fi - history ] for the history of this result and its generalizations .",
    "we apply our theory to prove a large number of results about categories of interest .",
    "we mention three of these results here .",
    "this conjecture , posed by jean lannes and lionel schwartz in the late 1980s , is equivalent to the assertion that @xmath84 is noetherian , i.e. , the principal projectives @xmath85 are noetherian for all @xmath86 .",
    "as originally stated , the conjecture asserts the equivalent dual statement that the principal injectives are artinian .",
    "this first appeared in print as ( * ? ? ?",
    "* conjecture b.12 ) , and again in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* conjecture 3.12 ) . see ( * ? ? ? * proposition 3.13 ) for a number of equivalent formulations ; one such formulation is that any finitely generated functor has a resolution by finitely generated projectives , so that ext modules between finitely generated functors are finite dimensional .",
    "previous work on this had been of two sorts .",
    "papers @xcite focus on the structure of @xmath85 , and , in particular , show that @xmath85 is noetherian for @xmath87 and all @xmath88 , and @xmath89 and @xmath90 . in a different direction",
    ", schwartz showed that any polynomial functor taking finite dimensional values has a resolution by finitely generated projectives .",
    "see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 5.3.8 ) for the original proof , and ( * ? ?",
    "* proposition 10.1 ) for a slightly more general result of this sort .",
    "the conjecture is a special case of corollary  [ vi - noeth ] .",
    "a similar ( but distinct ) proof of this conjecture appears in @xcite .",
    "streamlined proofs of this conjecture based on these works can be found in @xcite .      in @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath91-syzygies of all segre embeddings ( with any number of factors of any dimensions , but with @xmath91 fixed ) are assembled into a single algebraic structure called a @xmath1-module .",
    "the two main results of @xcite state that , in characteristic @xmath18 , this structure is finitely generated and has a rational hilbert series .",
    "informally , these results mean that the @xmath91-syzygies of segre embeddings admit a finite description .",
    "we improve the results of @xcite in three ways .",
    "first , we show that the main theorems continue to hold in positive characteristic .",
    "we remark that the syzygies of the segre embeddings are known to behave differently in positive characteristic ( see @xcite for determinantal ideals , which for @xmath92 determinants are special cases of segre embeddings ) .",
    "while we only work with @xmath1-modules over fields , one can work over @xmath76 and show that for any given syzygy module , the type of torsion that appears is bounded .",
    "second , we greatly improve the rationality result for the hilbert series and give an affirmative answer to ( * ? ? ? *",
    "question  5 ) .",
    "this yields strong constraints on how @xmath91-syzygies of the segre embeddings vary with the number of factors .    finally , we remove a technical assumption from @xcite : that paper only dealt with `` small '' @xmath1-modules , whereas our methods handle all finitely generated @xmath1-modules .",
    "this is useful for technical reasons : for instance , it shows that a finitely generated @xmath1-module admits a resolution by finitely generated projective @xmath1-modules . in particular , we find that @xmath1-modules of syzygies are finitely presented , and so can be completely described in a finite manner .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that this paper greatly simplifies the approach to @xmath1-modules .",
    "the treatment in @xcite is abstract and complicated .",
    "ours is much more elementary and direct .",
    "a twisted commutative algebra ( tca ) is a graded algebra on which the symmetric group @xmath6 acts on the @xmath61th graded piece so that the multiplication is commutative up to a `` twist '' by the symmetric group . in characteristic @xmath18",
    ", one can use schur  weyl duality to describe tca s in terms of commutative algebras with an action of @xmath93 , and we have fruitfully exploited this to obtain many results @xcite .",
    "this method is inapplicable in positive characteristic , so we know much less about tca s there . in @xcite ,",
    "the univariate tca @xmath94 was analyzed , for any ring @xmath2 , and certain fundamental results ( such as noetherianity ) were established .",
    "we establish many of the same results for the multivariate tca @xmath95 ; see  [ ss : tca ] for details .",
    "* the idea of reducing noetherianity of an algebraic structure to that of a poset has been used before in different contexts .",
    "we highlight @xcite for an example in universal algebra and @xcite for examples in abstract algebra . after writing a first draft of this article ,",
    "henning krause notified us that the statement of theorem  [ grobnoeth ] for grbner categories appears in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.1 ) . *",
    "the notion of quasi - grbner formalizes the intuitive idea of `` breaking symmetry . '' a similar idea is used in @xcite to define grbner bases for symmetric operads by passing to the weaker structure of shuffle operads .",
    "this idea is used in @xcite to study hilbert series of operads with well - behaved grbner bases . *",
    "a related topic ( and one that serves as motivation for us ) is the notion of `` noetherianity up to symmetry '' in multilinear algebra and algebraic statistics .",
    "we point to @xcite for some applications of noetherianity and to @xcite for a survey and further references .",
    "* while preparing this article , we discovered that an essentially equivalent version of proposition  [ prop : secondorder - noeth ] is proven in the proof of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 7.5 ) . *",
    "another source of motivation is the topic of representation stability @xcite and its relation to @xmath3-modules @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of our approach over the ones in @xcite is its flexibility .",
    "for example , it is remarked after ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 2.12 ) that their techniques can not handle linear analogues of @xmath3 ; we handle these in theorem  [ thm : vi - noeth ] .",
    "the paper is divided into two parts : theory and applications .",
    "the first part on theory begins with background results on noetherian posets (  [ sec : posets ] ) .",
    "the material on posets is standard and we have included proofs to make it self - contained ; we use it for applications to noetherian conditions on representations of categories .    in  [ sec : rep - cat ] we introduce basic terminology and properties of representations of categories and functors between them .",
    "we state criteria for noetherian conditions on representations which will be further developed in later sections .",
    " [ sec : noeth - grob ] introduces and develops the main topic of this paper : grbner bases for representations of categories and ( quasi-)grbner categories .",
    "we give a criterion for categories to admit a grbner basis theory and relate noetherian properties of representations to those of posets .",
    " [ s : lang ] discusses formal languages and is a mix of review and new material on ordered languages .",
    "this material is essential for  [ sec : ling ] , which contains our applications to hilbert series of representations of categories . here",
    "we introduce the notion of lingual structures on categories and connect properties of hilbert series with formal languages .",
    "the second part of the paper contains applications of the theory developed in the first part . ",
    "[ sec : cat - inj ] is about categories of finite sets and injective functions of different kinds .",
    "this has two sources of motivation : the theory of @xmath3-modules @xcite and the theory of twisted commutative algebras @xcite .",
    "we recover and strengthen known results on noetherianity and hilbert series for these categories and related ones .",
    " [ sec : cat - surj ] concerns categories of finite sets and surjective functions .",
    "these categories are much more complicated than their injective counterparts .",
    "a significant application of the results here is the proof of the lannes  schwartz artinian conjecture ( discussed in ",

    " [ sec : delta - mod ] is about applications to @xmath1-modules ( introduced by the second author in @xcite ) .",
