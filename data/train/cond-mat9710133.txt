    "this is the second of a series of papers where we analyze the burgers equation in one spatial dimension with the purpose of modelling the growth of an interface ; for a brief account we refer to @xcite . in the first paper , denoted in the following by a @xcite",
    ", we investigated the _ noiseless _ burgers equation @xcite in terms of its nonlinear soliton or shock wave excitations and linear diffusive modes . in the present paper",
    "we address our main objective , namely the _ noisy _ burgers equation in one spatial dimension @xcite .",
    "this equation has the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a damping constant or viscosity and @xmath6 a nonlinear coupling strength .",
    "the equation is driven by a conserved white noise term , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 has a gaussian distribution and is short - range correlated in space according to @xmath9 in the context of modelling a growing interface the kardar - parisi - zhang equation ( kpz ) for the height field @xmath10 @xcite @xmath11 is equivalent to the burgers equation by means of the relationships @xmath12 that is the burgers equation governs the dynamics of the local slope of the interface . in fig .",
    "1 we have sketched the growth morphology in terms of the height and slope fields .",
    "the substantial conceptual problems encountered in nonequilibrium physics are in many ways embodied in the burgers - kpz equations ( [ bur ] ) and ( [ kpz ] ) which describe the self - affine growth of an interface subject to annealed noise arising from fluctuations in the drive or in the environment @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the burgers - kpz equations are also encountered in a variety of other problems such as randomly stirred fluids @xcite , dissipative transport in a driven lattice gas @xcite , the propagation of flame fronts @xcite , the sine - gordon equation @xcite , and magnetic flux lines in superconductors@xcite .",
    "furthermore , by means of the cole- hopf transformation@xcite the burgers - kpz equations are also related to the problem of a directed polymer @xcite or a quantum particle in a random medium @xcite and thus to the theory of spin glasses @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the case of the noiseless burgers equation discussed in a where the slope field eventually relaxes due to the dissipative term @xmath13 , unless energy is supplied to the system at the boundaries , the noisy burgers equation ( [ bur ] ) describes an open nonlinear dissipative system driven into a stationary state with random energy input at a short wave length scale provided by the conserved noise , @xmath7 . in the stationary regime",
    "the equation thus describes time - independent stochastic self - affine roughened growth . in the linear case for @xmath14 the burgers equation reduces to the noise - driven edwards - wilkinson equation ( ew ) @xcite @xmath15 here for the slope field @xmath16 .",
    "owing to the absence of the nonlinear growth term @xmath17 the cascade in wave number space is absent and the correlations , probability distributions , and scaling properties are easy to derive @xcite .",
    "furthermore , unlike the burgers case the ew equation , being compatible with a fluctuation - dissipation theorem , actually describes the dynamic fluctuations in an equilibrium state with temperature @xmath18 ( in units such that @xmath19 ) and as a consequence does not provide a proper description of a growing interface . on the other hand , the presence of the nonlinear growth term @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( [ bur ] ) renders it much more complicated and much richer .",
    "the term filters the input noise @xmath7 and gives rise to interactions between different wave number components leading to a cascade which changes both the scaling properties and the probability distributions from the linear ew case .",
    "the burgers - kpz equations owing to their simple form accompanied by their very complex behavior have served as paradigms in the theory of driven and disordered systems and have been studied intensively @xcite .",
    "one set of issues which have been addressed are the scaling properties @xcite .",
    "according to the dynamic scaling hypothesis @xcite supported by numerical simulations and the fixed point structure of a renormalization group scaling analysis , @xcite , the slope field @xmath16 is statistically scale invariant in the sense that the self - affine rescaled @xmath20 is statistically equivalent to @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a scale parameter .",
    "more precisely , the scaling hypothesis implies the following dynamical scaling form for the slope correlation function in the stationary regime @xcite : @xmath23 the scaling behavior in the long wave length - low frequency limit is thus governed by two scaling dimensions : i ) the roughness or wandering exponent @xmath24 , characterizing the slope correlations for a stationary profile and ii ) the dynamic exponent @xmath3 , describing the temporal scaling in the stationary regime @xcite .",
    "the slope field @xmath16 has the scaling dimension @xmath25 . for large @xmath26 the scaling function @xmath27 ; for small @xmath26 @xmath28 .",
    "two properties determine the scaling exponents , namely a scaling law and an effective fluctuation - dissipation theorem . like the noiseless or deterministic burgers equation discussed in a",
    ", the noisy equation is also invariant under a nonlinear galilean transformation @xcite @xmath29 since the nonlinear coupling strength @xmath6 here enters as a structural constant of the galilean symmetry group it transforms trivially under a scaling transformation and we infer the scaling law @xcite @xmath30 relating @xmath24 and @xmath3 . furthermore , noting that the stationary fokker - planck equation for the burgers equation ( [ bur ] ) is solved by a gaussian distribution @xcite @xmath31 } ~ , \\label{gauss}\\ ] ] _ independent _ of @xmath6 it follows that @xmath16 is an independent random variable and that the height variable @xmath10 according to eq .",
    "( [ height ] ) performs random walk , corresponding to the roughness exponent @xmath32 , also in the linear ew case . from the scaling law ( [ sl ] ) we subsequently obtain the dynamic exponent @xmath1 . in the linear ew case @xmath32 and @xmath33 , characteristic of diffusion . in table 1",
    "we have summarized the exponents for the ew and burgers / kpz universality classes .    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table 1 .",
    "exponents and universality classes    the standard tool used in the analysis of the scaling properties of nonlinear langevin equations of the type in eqs .",
    "( [ bur]-[kpz ] ) is the dynamic renormalization group ( drg ) method @xcite .",
    "the method is based on an expansion in powers of the nonlinear couplings , an expansion in the noise strength , arising from the noise contractions when implementing the statistical average , combined with an infinitesimal momentum shell integration in the short wave length limit , corresponding to the scaling transformation .",
    "the method operates in variable dimension @xmath34 and typically identifies critical dimensions separating regions where infrared convergent perturbation theory holds yielding mean field behavior from regions with infrared divergent expansions .",
    "here the drg allows for an organisation of the divergent terms and yields renormalization group equations for the effective parameters in the theory in terms of an epsilon expansion about the critical dimension . in powers of epsilon",
    "the drg thus yields expression for the critical exponents and information about the scaling functions .    for the burgers - kpz equations the expansion is in powers of the nonlinear coupling strength @xmath6 and the noise strength @xmath35 .",
    "the critical dimension is @xmath36 , also following from simple power counting .",
    "below @xmath37 there appear two renormalization group fixed points : an unstable gaussian fixed point , corresponding to vanishing coupling strength , describing a smooth interface governed by the ew equation , and a stable strong coupling fixed point , characterizing a rough interface .",
    "the exponents assume non - trivial values for all @xmath38 . in @xmath39",
    "an effective fluctuation - dissipation theorem equivalent to the gaussian form in eq . ( [ gauss ] ) is operative , and together with the galilean invariance , implying trivial scaling of @xmath6 , the renormalization group equations yield the exponents in table 1 associated with the infrared stable non - trivial strong coupling fixed point @xcite .",
    "unlike the case of static and dynamic critical phenomena , where the renormalization group methods have proven very successful @xcite , the situation in the case of nonequilibrium phenomena exemplified here by the burgers - kpz equations has proven more difficult and despite extensive efforts based on drg calculations to higher loop order @xcite and mode coupling approaches @xcite the physics of the strong coupling fixed point in @xmath39 still remains elusive .    in a recent letter , denoted in the following by l @xcite",
    ", we approached the strong coupling fixed point behavior from the point of view of the mapping of the burgers equation onto an equivalent solid - on - solid or driven lattice gas model @xcite , which furthermore maps onto a discrete spin @xmath40 chain model @xcite .",
    "the quantum spin chain approach has been proposed in @xcite , and considered further in @xcite , on the basis of the equivalence between the liouville operator in the master equation describing the evolution of the one - dimensional driven lattice gas , or the equivalent lattice interface solid - on - solid growth model , and a non - hermitian spin @xmath40 hamiltonian .",
    "the quantum chain model has been treated by means of bethe - ansatz methods @xcite and the dynamic exponent @xmath1 obtained from the finite size mass gap scaling . in l we pushed the analysis",
    "further and constructing a harmonic oscillator representation valid for large spin in combination with a continuum limit we derived a hamiltonian description and a set of coupled field equations of motion for the spin field , corresponding to the slope @xmath16 , and a conjugate `` azimuthal '' angle field replacing the noise .",
    "the field equations admit spin wave solutions , corresponding to the linear diffusive modes and , more importantly , nonlinear localized soliton solutions , describing the growing steps in the original kpz equation or the solitons or shocks in the burgers equation .",
    "we also derived the soliton dispersion law and after a quasi - classical quantization identified in a heuristic manner the elementary excitations of the theory . from the dispersion law",
    "we deduced the dynamic exponent @xmath1 , characteristic of the zero temperature fixed point of the `` quantum theory '' .",
    "the picture that emerged from our analysis was that of a dilute quasi - particle gas of nonlinear soliton modes yielding @xmath1 and a superposed spin wave gas , corresponding to @xmath33 , the dynamic exponent for the linear case .",
    "in l we also briefly discussed the operator algebra associated with the hamiltonian representation and derived the field equations by means of a canonical representation of the fokker - planck equation for the equivalent burgers equation . whereas the bethe - ansatz investigations by their nature are restricted to special values of the coupling strength , corresponding to the fully asymmetric exclusion model @xcite , our analysis is valid for general coupling strength and thus constitutes an extension of the bethe - ansatz method to the general case of a continuum field theory .",
    "the analysis in l was in many respects incomplete and preliminary but it did indicate that the strong coupling fixed point behavior is intrinsically associated with the soliton modes in the burgers equation since they both provide aspects of the growth morphology and also , independently , yield the dynamic exponent .",
    "here we present a _",
    "unified _ approach to the noisy burgers based on the martin - siggia - rose technique in functional form @xcite .",
    "this method supersedes the analysis in l and does not make use of the mapping to a spin chain via a solid - on - solid model and therefore the implicit assumption of persistent universality classes under the mappings .",
    "clearly , the different formulations are basically equivalent arising as they do from the same basic stochastic growth problem .",
    "the equivalence also indirectly demonstrates that the scaling properties of the different models , i.e. , the solid - on - solid model , the spin chain , and the field formulation , fall in the same kpz - burgers universality class .",
    "the present functional path integral method which also can be seen as a generalization of the stationary distribution ( [ gauss ] ) to the time - dependent nonlinear case provides a many - body description of the morphology of a growing interface in terms of soliton excitations and does also give insight into the scaling behavior .",
    "below we highlight some of our results .    *",
    "the path integral formulation yields a compact description of the noisy burgers equation and provides expressions for the probability distributions and correlation functions .",
    "reformulated as a canonical feynman - type phase space path integral the approach allows for _ a principle of least action_. hence the weight of the different paths or interface configurations , corresponding to the noise - induced interface fluctuations , contributing to the path integral are controlled by an effective action .",
    "the role of the effective planck constant is here played by the noise correlation strength @xmath35 .",
    "the action in the path integral thus plays the same role for the dynamical configurations as the hamiltonian in the boltzmann factor for the static configurations in equilibrium statistical mechanics . * in the asymptotic weak noise limit the principle of least action implies that the dominant configurations arising from the solutions of the saddle point field equations correspond to a a dilute nonlinear soliton gas with superposed linear diffusive modes . the canonical formulation and the principle of least action furthermore allow a dynamical description and associate energy , momentum , and action with the solitons and the diffusive modes . *",
    "the path integral formulation permits a `` quantum mechanical '' interpretation in terms of an underlying non - hermitian relaxational `` quantum mechanics '' or `` quantum field theory '' .",
    "the noise - induced fluctuations here correspond to `` quantum fluctuations '' and the fluctuating growth morphology is described by a landau - type quasi - particle gas of nonlinear `` quantum solitons '' and linear `` quantum diffusive modes '' . in the height field",
    "this corresponds to a morphology of growing steps with superposed linear modes .",
    "the `` quantum soliton '' dispersion law is gapless and characterized by an exponent @xmath41 ; the `` quantum diffusive mode '' dispersion law is quadratic with a gap in the spectrum proportional to the soliton amplitude .",
    "* in the present formulation the scaling properties associated with the `` zero temperature '' fixed point in the underlying `` quantum field theory '' follow as a by - product from the soliton and diffusive mode dispersion laws and the spectral representation of the correlations .",
    "the dominant excitation in the long wave length - low frequency limit identifies the relevant universality class .",
    "the present many - body formulation yields the known exponents .",
    "the dynamic exponents @xmath1 and @xmath33 are associated with the soliton and diffusive mode dispersion laws , respectively , whereas the roughness exponent @xmath2 follows from a regularity property of the form factor in the spectral representation .",
    "the many - body formulation also explains the robustness of the roughness exponent under a change of universality class and provides a heuristic expression for the scaling function which has the same structure as the probability distribution for lvy flights .",
    "* from a field theoretical point of view we identify the noise strength @xmath35 as the effective _ small parameter_. furthermore , the fundamental probability distribution or path integral has an _ essential singularity _ for @xmath42 .",
    "hence our approach is based on a _ non - perturbative saddle point or steepest descent approximation _ to the path integral .",
    "we believe that it is in this respect that the dynamic renormalization group method based on an expansion in @xmath6 _ and _ in the noise contraction @xmath35 fails to access the strong coupling fixed point .",
    "the path integral representation of the noisy burgers equation presented here is equivalent to a full - fledged one dimensional non - hermitian non - lagrangian field theory and requires for its detailed analysis some advanced field theoretical techniques and methods from quantum chaos . in the present context",
    "we choose , however , a somewhat heuristic approach to the path integral in order to elucidate the emerging simple physical picture of a growing interface .",
    "this approach then also serves as a tutorial introduction to the field theoretical treatment to be presented elsewhere .",
    "the present paper is organized in the following way . in section",
    "ii we discuss the simple case of the linear edwards - wilkinson equation , mainly in order to emphasize the non - perturbative nature of the noise as regards the stationary driven regime .",
    "since the soliton modes in the noisy burgers equation turn out to be of crucial importance in understanding the morphology and scaling properties , we summarize in section iii the results obtained in a concerning the solitons and diffusive modes in the noiseless burgers equation . in section",
    "iv we set up the path integral formulation for the noisy burgers equation in terms of the martin - siggia - rose techniques in functional form . in section",
    "v we perform a shift transformation of the path integral to a canonical feynman path integral form and discuss the canonical structure and the associated symmetry algebra .",

    "vii we solve the field equations and derive nonlinear soliton and linear diffusive mode solutions . in section viii we discuss the dynamics of the solitons following from the principle of least action .",
    "the dominating morphology of a stochastically growing interface can be interpreted in terms of a dilute soliton gas ; this aspect is discussed in some detail in section ix .",
    "the fluctuation spectrum about the soliton solutions is basically given by the path integral , however , in section x we take a heuristic point of view and discuss the fluctuations as `` quantum fluctuations '' in the underlying non - hermitian `` quantum field theory '' .",
    "section xi is devoted to a discussion of the scaling properties and universality classes on the basis of the `` elementary excitations '' in the `` quantum description '' .",
    "we also present a heuristic expression for the scaling function . finally in section",
    "xii we present a discussion and a conclusion .",

    "more precisely the point is the following : whereas the damping constant @xmath5 together with the relevant wave number @xmath94 defines the time scale for the transient regime where the system has memory and evolves forward in time in an irreversible manner , the presence of the noise is essential in order for the system to leave the transient regime _ at all _ and to enter the stationary regime where the system is time reversal invariant , as for example reflected in the evenness in @xmath95 in the slope correlation function ( [ lor ] ) . in the absence of the noise",
    "the system simply decays owing to dissipation unless it is driven by deterministic currents at the boundaries . imposing",
    "the noise and driving the system stochastically is thus a _ singular _ process , as reflected mathematically by the essential singularity in the distribution ( [ gauss2 ] ) .",
    "although the above observation of the non - perturbative role of the noise strength @xmath35 is a trivial statement in the linear case where is just reflects the structure of the boltzmann factor , we will later show that in a more complete theory of a growing interface , described by the nonlinear noisy burgers equation , it is essential to take into account non - perturbative contributions in the noise strength @xmath35 .",
    "it turns out that the soliton excitation in the _ noiseless _ burgers equation when properly generalized play an important role in the understanding of the growth morphology and strong coupling behavior of the noisy burgers equation . in a",
    "we discussed in some detail the soliton and diffusive mode solutions in the noiseless burgers equation and performed a linear stability analysis . here",

    "the agreement between the numerical simulations and the analytical method is good , indicating that the mode coupling approach seems to capture essential properties of the strong coupling fixed point behavior .",
    "the heuristic and preliminary character of the scaling function given here does not allow a detailed comparison .",
    "we note , however , that since @xmath485 in the burgers - kpz case the dimensionless argument in the scaling function @xmath426 is @xmath486 .",
    "this is in complete agreement with the driven lattice gas drg analysis in @xcite and with the general arguments advanced in the mode coupling analysis in @xcite .",
    "we also note the curious fact that the spectral form ( [ 6 ] ) for a gapless dispersion with exponent @xmath461 bears resemblance to the form of the probability distribution for a one - dimensional lvy flight with index @xmath487 @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath488 corresponds to ordinary brownian walk , whereas @xmath489 is equivalent to super diffusion .    the present analysis of the scaling properties based on the spectral form ( [ 6 ] ) originates from a weak noise saddle point approximation to the path integral and as such only holds for @xmath67 .",
    "however , within the general assumptions underlying the application of scaling theory and the notion of universality classes , we expect the exponents and scaling function to be universal characteristics of the system and thus _ independent _ of the noise strength @xmath35 .",
    "this property can , however , be reconciled with the present many - body approach if we assume that an enhancement of the noise strength , that is a stronger drive of the system , only leads to a _ dressing _ of the quasi - particle spectrum , i.e. , a change in the stiffness constant , and not to a change in the exponent @xmath461 . in the `` quantum mechanical '' language this corresponds to the assumption that the wkb approximation also holds in the strong `` quantum regime '' as far as the exponent of the quasi - particle dispersion law",
    "is concerned .",
    "we conclude this section with a few speculative remarks concerning the `` breakdown of hydrodynamics '' .",
    "the noisy burgers equation is basically a nonlinear conserved hydrodynamical equation derived by combining the conservation law @xmath490 with a constitutive equation for the current , @xmath491 , with transport coefficients @xmath5 ( the damping ) and @xmath6 ( the mode coupling ) .",
    "the expression for the deterministic part of @xmath132 is thus based on a gradient expansion to lowest order and the simplest quadratic nonlinearity in @xmath16 .",
    "the issue is in which way the mode coupling term affects the hydrodynamical properties . in this context `` breakdown of hydrodynamics '' usually refers to the situation where the underlying regularity structure of the gradient expansion , i.e. , in wave number space regularity in an expansion in @xmath94 , breaks down .    in the present many - body formulation , entailing the spectral form ( [ 6 ] ) , we obtain in frequency space @xmath492 in the linear ew case for @xmath493 we recover the diffusive form ( [ lor ] ) , corresponding to a diffusive pole @xmath494 in the complex @xmath95 - plane .",
    "however , in the nonlinear mode coupling case for @xmath38 , @xmath495 and @xmath91 develops a branch cut structure , corresponding to a non - analytic wave number dependence in the current , i.e. , a breakdown of hydrodynamics .",
    "in the present paper we have advanced a novel approach to the growth morphology and scaling behavior of the noisy burgers equation in one dimension . using the martin - siggia - rose ( msr ) technique in a canonical form we have demonstrated that the physics of the so far elusive strong coupling fixed point is associated with an essential singularity in the noise strength and",
    "can be accessed by appropriate theoretical soliton techniques .    the canonical representation of the msr functional integral in terms of a feynman phase space path integral with a complex hamiltonian identifies the noise strength as the relevant small non - perturbative parameter and allows for _ a principle of least action_. in the asymptotic weak noise limit the leading contributions to the path integral are given by a dilute gas of solitons with superposed linear diffusive modes .",
    "the canonical variables are the local slope of the interface and an associated `` conjugate '' noise field , characteristic of the msr formalism . in terms of the local slope the soliton and diffusive mode picture provide a many - body description of a growing interface governed by the noisy burgers equation .",
    "the noise - induced slope fluctuations are here represented by the various paths or configurations contributing to the path integral .",
    "the canonical formulation of the path integral and the associated principle of least action also allow us to associate energy , momentum , and action with a given soliton configuration or growth morphology .",
    "this gives rise to _ a dynamical selection criterion _ similar to the role of the boltzmann factor @xmath127 in equilibrium statistical mechanics which associates an energy @xmath267 with a given configuration contributing to the partition function ; in the dynamical case the action @xmath157 provides the weight function for the dynamical configuration .",
    "more detailed , in the dynamical case , `` rotating '' the noise variable , @xmath496 , we have the partition function @xmath497}\\\\ \\tilde{s}=&&\\int dxdt[u\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t } -\\tilde{\\cal h } ( u,\\varphi)]\\\\ \\tilde{\\cal h } = & & -\\frac{\\nu}{2}[(\\nabla u)^2-(\\nabla\\varphi)^2]+ \\frac{\\lambda}{2}u^2\\nabla\\varphi ~ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] whereas in the equilibrium case we have the general form in one dimension , @xmath498}\\\\ h=&&\\int dx{\\cal h}(p , q ) ~ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath166 is the hamiltonian density . by comparison",
    "we note that the noise strength @xmath35 plays the role of a `` temperature '' in the dynamical case .",
    "we also observe that @xmath499 for the dynamical 1-d problem , treating time as an additional coordinate , i.e. , @xmath500 , is equivalent to a 2-d equilibrium partition function with hamiltonian @xmath501-\\frac{\\lambda}{2 } u^2\\nabla_x\\varphi]\\ ] ] and temperature @xmath502 .",
    "in addition to providing a physical many - body picture of the morphology of a growing interface in terms of soliton modes accounting for the growth aspects and diffusive modes corresponding to the relaxational aspects , the present approach also gives insight into the scaling properties .",
    "the perspective here is not a `` coarse - graining '' procedure , replacing the original description by a scaling description with ensuing dynamical renormalization group ( drg ) equations , but rather a focus on the gapless elementary excitations or quasi - particles of the many - body theory .",
    "the case of simple scaling characterized by a roughness exponent , a dynamical exponent , and a scaling function , corresponding to a simple fixed point structure in the drg analysis , is here represented by a simple quasi - particle mode exhausting the bottom of the spectrum with a gapless dispersion law . the dynamic exponent is given by the exponent in the quasi - particle dispersion law , whereas the roughness exponent follows from a regularity property of the form factor in a spectral representation of the slope correlations ; the scaling function being given by the spectral form itself .",
    "our analysis shows that the nonequilibrium growth dynamics in one dimension is controlled by solitons or dynamic domain wall . in this respect",
    "their is a parallel between the present kinetic growth problem and other well - studied low dimensional equilibrium problems also controlled by localized excitations such as the one dimensional ising model with domain wall excitations or the two dimensional xy model characterized by vortex excitations @xcite .",
    "the present approach is conducted in one dimension and assumes a spatially short - range correlated conserved noise in order to implement the shift transformation leading to the canonical formulation and the separation of the hamiltonian in a harmonic part and an interacting part . in higher dimension the burgers equation becomes a vector equation with a nonlinear term @xmath503 and we obtain a more complicated hamiltonian governing the dynamics .",
    "we have not pursued the higher dimensional case yet , but it is nevertheless interesting to speculate that the strong coupling fixed point behavior in @xmath504 and below is associated with higher dimensional localized soliton - like excitations , i.e. , the dynamics is defect - dominated .    finally we wish to comment on some recent work on the driven burgers equation with noise at large length scales modelling forced turbulence .",
    "this problem has been treated using a variety of methods such as operator product expansions @xcite , instanton calculations @xcite , and replica methods @xcite . in this context",
    "the non - perturbative instanton methods used in order to determine the tail of the velocity probability distribution seem superficially to be related to the present soliton approach in that they are also based on a saddle point approximation to the msr functional integral . however , unlike the the soliton which is only localized in space , the instanton is localized in both space and time , yielding a finite action , and does not represent a soliton in the burgers equation .",
    "the difference between the two approaches is related to the spatial correlations of the noise driving the system : in the forced turbulence case the noise is correlated at large distances , whereas in the growth problem the noise is assumed to be conserved and delta function correlated in space .",

    "we note that the heisenberg equations of motion `` drive the operators away from hermiticity '' since @xmath302 is non - hermitian .",
