    "flow inside a porous medium finds many applications in natural and engineering systems .",
    "subsurface flows  @xcite , erosion  @xcite , fuel cells  @xcite , and filtration systems  @xcite are a few examples of physical processes that are governed by low reynolds number porous media flow . accurately resolving such flows is essential for modelling transport  @xcite , mixing  @xcite , anomalous diffusion  @xcite , breakthrough curves  @xcite , carbon dioxide sequestration  @xcite , uncertainty quantification  @xcite , chemical reactions  @xcite , and many other applications . in most of these works , in particular , those that focus on numerics and modelling , the porous medium is assumed to be two dimensional .",
    "therefore , there is a strong need for efficient and accurate numerical methods to simulate complex two - dimensional porous media flow . in this paper , we focus on solving the two - dimensional incompressible stokes equations in the geometry illustrated in .",
    "the incompressible stokes equations have been solved in porous domains resembling using finite differences  @xcite , finite volumes  @xcite , algebraic multigrid  @xcite , lattice - boltzmann  @xcite , and continuous time random walks  @xcite .",
    "however , each of these methods struggle with either enforcing incompressibility , meshing the geometry , or obtaining high - order accuracy .",
    "boundary integral equations ( bies ) , on the other hand , are a powerful method that addresses each of these challenges .",
    "in particular , bies are naturally adaptive , allow for high - order approximations , automatically enforce the incompressibility constraint , and enable the computation of the velocity field without computing the pressure .",
    "another advantage of a bie is that the unknown two - dimensional velocity field is written in terms of a one - dimensional integral over the boundary of the domain .",
    "this dimension reduction implies that only the boundary , which is a collection of one - dimensional closed curves , needs to be meshed .",
    "furthermore , a natural extension of this work is to solve the three - dimensional stokes equations while only discretizing the two - dimensional boundary of the geometry .",
    "other groups have used integral equations to simulate porous media by using a darcy approximation  @xcite , or by coupling a penalization method with a volume integral equation  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , we will use a boundary integral equation to solve the incompressible stokes equations .",
    "the main disadvantage of bies is the need to solve a dense linear system of equations . a direct solver based on gaussian elimination requires @xmath3 operations  where @xmath4 denotes the number of unknowns  which is impractical for realistic geometries .",
    "it also requires the assembly and storage of the dense matrix , leading to an @xmath5 memory requirement .",
    "iterative solvers such as gmres , on the other hand , only rely on ( accelerated ) matrix - vector multiplications and have an @xmath6 memory requirement , but can suffer from a poor convergence behavior due to the ill - conditioning of the linear system .",
    "in the recent decade , there have been two main directions of research that have lead to faster algorithms for solving discretized bies .",
    "a first approach focuses on developing integral equations that result in linear systems that are both well - conditioned and require a mesh - independent number of gmres iterations to reach convergence  @xcite .",
    "these properties generally follow from second - kind integral equation methods with compact integral operators . because of the mesh - independent number of gmres iterations , the asymptotic cpu time scales with the cost of a single dense matrix - vector multiplication . using fast summation methods such as the fast multipole method ( fmm )  @xcite , ewald summation  @xcite , or tree - code methods  @xcite",
    ", the cost of a matrix - vector multiplication can be reduced from @xmath5 to either @xmath7 or @xmath6 . while this approach can result in an optimal asymptotic complexity , complexities of the geometry , such as nearly touching pores and regions of high curvature , often still results in a large number of gmres iterations  @xcite . in addition , the double - layer potential formulation , which requires a mesh - independent number of gmres iterations , has less regularity than the single - layer potential  @xcite , which requires a mesh - dependent number of gmres iterations . to reduce the number of iterations",
    ", a preconditioner can be incorporated .",
    "while simple techniques such as block - diagonal preconditioners are easy to construct , they are not always capable of reducing the number of iterations significantly .",
    "an incomplete list of more sophisticated preconditioners , which vary in construction time and efficacy , include additive or multiplicative schwarz  @xcite , bpx  @xcite , sparse approximate inverses  @xcite , approximate lu decompositions  @xcite , clustering  @xcite , integral equations of opposite order  @xcite , calderon identities  @xcite , or multigrid  @xcite . in the case of multigrid preconditioners ,",
    "specialized smoothers must be developed since standard smoothers like jacobi or gauss - seidel will smooth the low , rather than the high , frequency components .",
    "examples of such smoothers may require developing approximate inverses of the integral operator  @xcite involving , for example , the laplace - beltrami operator  @xcite .",
    "a second approach targets the use of fast direct solvers that exploit the structure of the linear system that arises when discretizing bies .",
    "the structure can be loosely described as matrices with hierarchical off - diagonal blocks being numerically low - rank .",
    "these matrices are formalized as , with an increasing level of complexity , hierarchically off - diagonal low - rank ( hodlr ) matrices  @xcite , hierarchically semi - separable ( hss ) matrices  @xcite , @xmath8-matrices  @xcite , and @xmath0-matrices  @xcite .",
    "fast methods for efficiently constructing and storing approximate inverses of these matrices have been developed in recent years  @xcite , mainly for the aforementioned hodlr and hss matrices .",
    "moreover , once the approximate inverse , which only depends on the geometry , is computed and stored , it can be applied with a minimal amount of cpu time to multiple right - hand sides .",
    "therefore , direct solvers are extremely useful when applying a temporal discretization to a partial differential equation  @xcite , or when considering scattering for many different incident waves  @xcite .",
    "we blend the two aforementioned approaches in this paper : we present the inverse fast multipole method ( ifmm )  @xcite as an inexact fast direct solver based on @xmath0-matrices and apply it as a preconditioner in a fast multipole accelerated gmres solver  @xcite .",
    "the preconditioner has a tunable accuracy @xmath1 and its computational cost scales almost linearly with the problem size as @xmath9 .",
    "we will demonstrate that the ifmm is capable of significantly reducing the number of iterations and the cpu time .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "discusses the fluid model and layer potential formulation",
    ". the inverse fast multipole method ( ifmm ) is subsequently introduced in , focusing on the main features for achieving an efficient preconditioner .",
    "numerical benchmarks are presented in .",
    "we report results for both the unpreconditioned system , and for preconditioned systems where block - diagonal and ifmm preconditioners ( at several accuracies ) are used . summarizing conclusions",
    "are finally drawn in .",
    "we are interested in simulating an incompressible newtonian fluid in the geometry illustrated in .",
    "we consider scales where the dimensionless reynolds number is small so that the fluid is assumed to be stokesian . if we assumed a homogeneous porosity , the much simpler darcy equations could be solved .",
    "however , we do not make this assumption and we focus on accurately and efficiently solving the incompressible stokes equation with a no - slip boundary condition on each pore .",
    "we also assume that the flow is two - dimensional and that there are no external body forces such as gravity .",
    "we avoid the stokes paradox by bounding the porous region by the boundary @xmath10 .",
    "to resemble a pipe flow , we let @xmath10 be a mollification of the rectangle @xmath11 \\times [ -h , h]$ ] ( see ) . by smoothing the corners of @xmath10 , specialized quadrature for integral equations",
    "is avoided .",
    "each inner boundary , denoted by @xmath12 , @xmath13 , is a circle of variable radii .",
    "the area enclosed by the outer boundary is denoted by @xmath14 , and the area enclosed by each pore by @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , the geometry is given by @xmath16 and its boundary is @xmath17 .    with this setup , by defining the fluid velocity @xmath18 , the pressure @xmath19 , the viscosity @xmath20 , and a prescribed flow on the boundary @xmath21 , the governing equations are @xmath22 we impose boundary conditions that correspond to a pipe flow at the intake and outtake , and no slip on the boundary of the pores @xmath23 where @xmath24 sets the velocity scale .",
    "furthermore , we assume that @xmath25 from this point onwards .",
    "a bie formulation of has several advantages over the differential form .",
    "the pressure need not be computed , the incompressibility constraint is automatically satisfied , and the velocity is written in terms of a layer potential involving an unknown density function defined only on @xmath26 .",
    "two popular choices for the layer potential are the single - layer and double - layer potentials @xmath27({\\mathbf{x } } ) & = \\frac{1}{4\\pi } \\int_{\\gamma } \\left (     -\\log \\rho \\mathbf{i } + \\frac{{\\mathbf{r}}\\otimes { \\mathbf{r}}}{\\rho^{2}}\\right )     { \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}({\\mathbf{y } } ) ds_{{\\mathbf{y } } } , \\qquad & & { \\mathbf{x}}\\in \\omega , \\\\    \\mathcal{d}[{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}]({\\mathbf{x } } ) & = \\frac{1}{\\pi}\\int_{\\gamma }    \\frac{{\\mathbf{r}}\\cdot { \\mathbf{n}}}{\\rho^{2 } } \\frac{{\\mathbf{r}}\\otimes { \\mathbf{r}}}{\\rho^{2 } }    { \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}({\\mathbf{y } } ) ds_{{\\mathbf{y } } } , & & { \\mathbf{x}}\\in \\omega,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] respectively , where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the unit outward normal , and @xmath31 is a density function defined on @xmath26 . given our dirichlet boundary condition , the double - layer potential formulation results in a second - kind integral equation whose condition number is guaranteed to be mesh - independent .",
    "however , the single - layer potential requires less smoothness of @xmath31 since  @xcite @xmath32 are continuous .",
    "moreover , this result holds even under the relaxed assumption that @xmath33 is a bounded lipschitz domain .",
    "another advantage of the single - layer potential is that it has full - rank , as opposed to the double - layer potential which has a rank three null space  @xcite for each connected component of @xmath26 .",
    "while this rank deficiency can be removed , it is unclear if this is compatible with the ifmm .",
    "moreover , for complex geometries , the double - layer potential may still require many gmres iterations  @xcite , but in this case , we expect that applying the ifmm preconditioner will result in a computational speedup .",
    "given the additional regularity and full - rank of the single - layer potential , we choose to represent the velocity @xmath34 as @xmath35({\\mathbf{x } } ) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi } \\int_{\\gamma } \\left (     -\\log \\rho \\mathbf{i } + \\frac{{\\mathbf{r}}\\otimes { \\mathbf{r}}}{\\rho^{2}}\\right )     { \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}({\\mathbf{y } } ) ds_{{\\mathbf{y } } } , \\quad { \\mathbf{x}}\\in \\omega ,    \\label{eq : stokesslp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is an unknown density function .",
    "taking the limiting value of as @xmath36 tends to @xmath26 , the density function @xmath31 must satisfy the first - kind integral equation  @xcite @xmath37 it is known that upon discretizing , the result is an ill - conditioned linear system that requires a mesh - dependent number of gmres iterations .",
    "however , the linear system is amenable to the solvers for structured matrices .",
    "once the unique solution of is computed , the density function @xmath31 is substituted into to evaluate the velocity @xmath18 at any point @xmath38 .",
    "we adopt a collocation method to discretize .",
    "first , each interior curve @xmath12 , @xmath13 is parameterized and discretized at @xmath39 points , and the outer wall is discretized at @xmath40 points .",
    "the resulting discretization points are @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "we enforce the bie at these @xmath43 collocation points by requiring @xmath44 then , quadrature is applied , where the quadrature nodes coincide with the discretization points @xmath41 .",
    "this results in the dense linear system @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the kernel of the integral operator in .",
    "the weights @xmath47 are the product of the arclength term with appropriate quadrature weights .",
    "we integrate the weak logarithmic singularity by applying a sixth - order quadrature rule of kapur and rokhlin  @xcite .",
    "this quadrature rule is identical to the trapezoid rule , except that the weights are modified at the six nodes to the left and right of the singularity .",
    "therefore , the quadrature nodes coincide with the discretization points @xmath41 , @xmath48 . since there are only @xmath49 quadrature weights that are modified for each @xmath41 , these quadrature rules are compatible with the fmm .",
    "in addition , in contrast to alpert quadrature rules  @xcite , additional quadrature nodes are not introduced , so no interpolation is required .",
    "given this quadrature formula ,   results in a dense @xmath50 linear system that , for brevity , we write as @xmath51 the matrix @xmath52 is a structured matrix with numerical low - rank off - diagonal blocks .",
    "gmres can be used to iteratively solve  , and each matrix - vector multiplication can be done with @xmath6 complexity by using the fmm . however , the number of required gmres iterations will be large , and depend on the mesh size .",
    "therefore , we will use the structure of @xmath52 to develop an efficient preconditioner for gmres .",
    "upon computing the density function @xmath31 at the points @xmath53 , the velocity field needs to be computed at points @xmath38 .",
    "this can be done with the trapezoid rule @xmath54 where @xmath55 is an arclength spacing of @xmath26 at @xmath56 .",
    "the trapezoid rule guarantees spectral accuracy , but this asymptotic convergence rate is delayed when @xmath36 is too close to @xmath26 . ] .",
    "there are methods to guarantee a uniform error for all @xmath57  @xcite , but this is not the focus of this work .",
    "instead , we focus on efficiently solving for the density function @xmath31 .",
    "the inverse fast multipole method ( ifmm )  @xcite is an inexact fast direct solver for @xmath0-matrices that can be applied as a preconditioner for gmres .",
    "it has successfully been used to precondition matrices arising from integral operators  @xcite and radial basis interpolation  @xcite .",
    "the main features of the algorithm are concisely described in the following subsections ; the reader is referred to @xcite for a more detailed description . although a 2d problem is considered in this paper ,",
    "the ifmm is applicable to 3d problems as well ( see  @xcite for examples ) .",
    "a variety of fast direct solvers for dense linear systems such as have been developed in recent years .",
    "these methods are based on a multilevel , hierarchical decomposition of the physical domain of interest , from the root down to the leaf level  @xmath58 ( e.g. , by means of a quadtree in 2d or an octree in 3d , either uniform or adaptive ) .",
    "this is subsequently exploited to represent the matrix @xmath52 in a compressed format .",
    "the simplest of these methods assume that all off - diagonal blocks are low - rank ( only self - interactions are considered to be of full - rank ) , leading to so - called hierarchically off - diagonal low - rank ( hodlr )  @xcite and hierarchically semi - separable ( hss ) matrices  @xcite . in the latter ,",
    "a nested approach is used ( i.e. ,  the low - rank basis at a certain hierarchical level is constructed using the low - rank basis at the child level ) , while this is not the case in the former .",
    "given this assumption on the matrix structure , the inversion can be performed exactly .",
    "direct @xmath6 algorithms for hodlr matrices can be found in  @xcite , while fast solvers for hss matrices have been presented by , among others , martinsson and rokhlin  @xcite , chandrasekaran et al .",
    "@xcite , xia et al .",
    "@xcite , and gillman et al .  @xcite .",
    "the assumption that all off - diagonal blocks are low - rank is a major drawback for the aforementioned hodlr and hss matrices .",
    "indeed , the rank is in that case likely to grow in an unbounded fashion for 2d and 3d problems with a complex geometry  @xcite , hence jeopardizing the computational efficiency of the algorithms .",
    "this drawback can be circumvented by adopting the more general framework of @xmath8- or @xmath0-matrices ( non - nested vs.  nested ) , in which only non - neighboring interactions are replaced by low - rank approximations .",
    "this is the approach followed in the ifmm  @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the algorithm presented in  @xcite has recently been extended by corona et al .",
    "@xcite to obtain a direct solver for hss matrices that scales for 2d problems as @xmath6 .",
    "we note that since our problem is two - dimensional , a hss approximation of would potentially have bounded rank . however , to extend the work to three dimensions , we choose to use an @xmath0 framework .",
    "an @xmath0-matrix @xmath59 is weak hierarchical matrix ( in which only non - neighboring , well - separated interactions are assumed to be low - rank ) with a nested basis that approximates the original matrix @xmath52 .",
    "it can be expressed as  @xcite @xmath60 @xmath59 is thus decomposed into a block sparse matrix , @xmath61 , containing all the neighboring and self - interactions at the leaf level @xmath58 , and a low - rank term , @xmath62 , that characterizes all well - separated interactions . @xmath63 and @xmath64 are interpolation and anterpolation operators , respectively , while @xmath65 is an @xmath0-matrix of a smaller size .",
    "is applied recursively to @xmath65 until the top level . ] , where there are no more well - separated interactions , is reached .",
    "the ifmm is a novel algorithm for the approximate inversion of an @xmath0-matrix , and consists of two crucial steps : extended sparsification and compression of fill - ins that appear throughout the elimination .",
    "the hierarchical structure of @xmath59 can be exploited to represent @xmath66 as an extended sparse system , which is more attractive from a computational point of view . introducing auxiliary variables @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( corresponding to multipole and local coefficients in the fmm ) leads to the following extended system : @xmath69 in , the sparse blocks @xmath61 , @xmath63 , and @xmath70 are situated in the top left corner of the matrix , while the remaining dense block @xmath65 is pushed to the bottom right corner of the matrix . as the latter is an @xmath0-matrix as well , the same technique can be applied recursively to further extend and sparsify the system .",
    "one finally obtains the following system of equations , which is equivalent to @xmath66 : @xmath71 the variables and equations are ordered in such a way that a sparse matrix with a symmetric fill - in pattern is obtained .",
    "note that this extended system is only moderately larger than the original system , since the dimensions of the auxiliary variables ( characterizing the low - rank interactions ) are small compared to the dimension of @xmath31 .",
    "the application of gaussian elimination to the extended sparse system of leads to the creation of dense fill - in blocks , which jeopardizes the computational efficiency of the method . in order to obtain a fast solver",
    ", it is crucial to preserve the sparsity pattern throughout the elimination .",
    "this can be achieved by compressing and redirecting fill - ins that correspond to well - separated interactions , as these are expected to have a numerically low - rank .",
    "for example , consider the fill - ins @xmath72 and @xmath73 arising between the well - separated variables @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( the prime indicates a fill - in ; @xmath76 and @xmath77 are originally zero blocks ) .",
    "these fill - ins can be approximated by a low - rank representation ( compression step ) by means of a truncated singular value decomposition ( svd ) in which only the most significant singular values and vectors are retained : @xmath78 the rank of approximations and is determined by a prescribed tolerance  @xmath1 ( either relative or absolute ) on the singular values .",
    "next , a recompression step is performed to obtain new low - rank interpolation and anterpolation operators @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively , as well as @xmath81 and @xmath82 , such that the fill - ins @xmath72 and @xmath73 can be redirected through the existing low - rank interaction between @xmath74 and @xmath75 in @xmath65 . as a result",
    ", there is no need to store @xmath72 and @xmath73 explicitly , implying that the sparsity pattern of the matrix is maintained throughout the elimination .",
    "if we make the assumption that the rank remains bounded as the problem size increases , it can be demonstrated that this leads to an algorithm with an asymptotic complexity of @xmath9 .",
    "although there is no mathematical proof to support this assumption , numerical examples confirm the fact that this is indeed the case in many practical examples  @xcite .",
    "the compression and recompression procedures make the ifmm inexact , but the accuracy can be tuned by varying @xmath1 . in terms of computational efficiency , one needs to make a trade - off between a highly accurate direct solver or a low - accuracy preconditioner .",
    "we focus in this paper on its use as a preconditioner .",
    "more details on the aforementioned procedures are provided in  @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath1 should be chosen in relation to the accuracy of the initial low - rank operators in ( i.e. , the higher the initial rank , the smaller @xmath1 should be ) .",
    "several numerical benchmarks are considered in this section to demonstrate the efficiency of the ifmm as a preconditioner for the problems under concern . in all of these benchmarks , is solved for the density vector @xmath83 with a fast multipole accelerated gmres solver  @xcite , and is subsequently used to evaluate the velocities @xmath84 inside the domain .",
    "a tolerance of @xmath85 is specified for the relative residual in gmres .",
    "the computations have been performed on intel^^ xeon^^ e5 - 2650 v2 ( 2.60  ghz ) cpus .    in all benchmarks ,",
    "a black - box approach is used in the ifmm for constructing the initial low - rank operators in .",
    "more precisely , interpolation based on chebyshev polynomials @xcite is employed ( with @xmath86 chebyshev nodes in each direction ) , followed by an additional svd to reduce the rank .",
    "a uniform quadtree decomposition of the domain is used , and the number of levels is adjusted to provide a reasonable trade - off between the time spent at the leaf level and the time spent at higher levels in the tree .",
    "we are interested in the porous geometry illustrated in .",
    "the outer wall is a rounded off version of the rectangle @xmath87 \\times [ -2.6,2.6]$ ] , and the radii of the pores are distributed in @xmath88 $ ] .",
    "the smallest gap between two pores is @xmath89 , and the smallest gap between a pore and the outer wall is @xmath90 .",
    "finally , the porous region has a porosity of @xmath91 .",
    "we test the preconditioner on simpler geometries by considering only the first @xmath92 and @xmath93 left - most pores .",
    "we also scale the outer boundary so that the area to the right of the pores remains roughly constant . before studying the pipe flow boundary conditions defined in , we first validate our method by examining the convergence with two sets of boundary conditions that have a closed - form solution in and  [ subsec : analytical ] .",
    "we subsequently discuss the pipe flow boundary conditions of in .",
    "we use a shear flow boundary condition on all the boundaries so that the exact solution is @xmath94 . with this boundary condition ,",
    "the density function @xmath83 is only non - zero along the outer boundary @xmath10 .",
    "a first small example involves only the first 22 pores ( see ) ; the geometry of the outer boundary @xmath96 is scaled so that the area of the pore - free region is the same as the area of the pore - free region in .",
    "we discretize each pore with @xmath97 points and the outer boundary with @xmath98 points .",
    "the resulting dense system has nearly @xmath99 unknowns .",
    "three different preconditioning approaches are used in gmres : ( i )  no preconditioner , ( ii )  a block - diagonal preconditioner ( with the diagonal blocks corresponding to the self - interactions of the individual pores and the outer boundary ) , and ( iii )  the ifmm . in the ifmm , ten chebyshev nodes are employed in each direction to construct the initial low - rank approximations ( @xmath100 ) , along with a relative accuracy @xmath101 for the low - rank ( re)compressions . the preconditioners in cases ( ii ) and ( iii ) are applied from the left as @xmath102 where @xmath103 represents the preconditioner .",
    "\\(a ) shows the relative residual as a function of the number of gmres iterations and ( b ) shows the cpu time required by the preconditioner and gmres for all three preconditioning strategies .",
    "convergence is very slow without a preconditioner and the relative residual does not drop below the desired tolerance within the prescribed maximum number of 1000 iterations .",
    "using the block - diagonal preconditioner , on the other hand , leads to convergence within 139 iterations .",
    "this is a very cheap preconditioning strategy , as the time needed to construct the preconditioner is negligible .",
    "the ifmm preconditioner is more expensive to compute , but the overall wall time is significantly reduced because the total number of iterations is reduced to merely 40 .",
    "note that the relative residual shown in ( a ) is the left preconditioned residual @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the estimated solution at each gmres iteration .",
    "the actual residual @xmath106 is computed as well once the latter drops below the prescribed tolerance .",

    "the overall computation times for each of the preconditioning approaches are presented in ( b ) and , where a decomposition is made into the time required to construct the preconditioner and the actual iteration time .",

    "the ifmm has been presented as an efficient preconditioner that is capable of significantly reducing the number of iterations and the overall computation cost .",
    "the ifmm is in essence an inexact fast direct solver for dense @xmath0-matrices with a linear complexity .",
    "this complexity is achieved through two key ideas : the hierarchical low - rank structure of the matrix is exploited to represent the original system as an extended sparse system , and low - rank ( re)compressions are applied to maintain the sparsity pattern of the latter throughout the gaussian elimination .",
    "the solver has a tunable accuracy @xmath1 allowing for a trade - off between a highly accurate direct solver and a low - accurate preconditioner .",

    "<S> we consider an efficient preconditioner for boundary integral equation ( bie ) formulations of the two - dimensional stokes equations in porous media . while bies are well - suited for resolving the complex porous geometry , they lead to a dense linear system of equations that is computationally expensive to solve for large problems . </S>",
    "<S> this expense is further amplified when a significant number of iterations is required in an iterative krylov solver such as gmres . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we apply a fast inexact direct solver , the inverse fast multipole method ( ifmm ) , as an efficient preconditioner for gmres . </S>",
    "<S> this solver is based on the framework of @xmath0-matrices and uses low - rank compressions to approximate certain matrix blocks . </S>",
    "<S> it has a tunable accuracy @xmath1 and a computational cost that scales as @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss various numerical benchmarks that validate the accuracy and confirm the efficiency of the proposed method . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate with several types of boundary conditions that the preconditioner is capable of significantly accelerating the convergence of gmres when compared to a simple block - diagonal preconditioner , especially for pipe flow problems involving many pores . </S>"
