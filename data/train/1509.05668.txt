    "characterization of the capacity of continuous - time channels under an average power constraint by waterfilling in the frequency domain , going back to shannon @xcite , has been given by gallager @xcite for linear time - invariant ( lti ) channels in great generality .",
    "at least since the advent of mobile communications , there has been a vivid interest in similar results for ltv channels ; see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite to cite only a few .",
    "although most wireless communication channels are modeled by _",
    "random _ ltv filters @xcite , @xcite , a waterfilling characterization of the capacity of deterministic ltv channels might also be of interest .",
    "furthermore , many nonstationary continuous - time sources can be described as the response of an ltv filter to white gaussian noise .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask for a solution to the dual problem , namely the reverse waterfilling characterization of the rate distortion function for such sources with a fidelity criterion .",
    "the classical answer to this question in the case of a stationary source , already outlined by kolmogorov in @xcite , has been given by berger @xcite for a broad class of stationary random processes .",
    "since then , until quite recently @xcite , no similar results for nonstationary sources have been reported . within the framework of time  frequency analysis , treating the time  frequency plane  as a whole \" @xcite , we present waterfilling solutions to both problems ( with constraints on the average energy in the case of the channel and on the squared - error distortion in the case of the source ) .",
    "we consider integral operators @xmath0 from the hilbert space @xmath1 of square - integrable functions @xmath2 into itself of the form @xmath3 with the kernel @xmath4 , i.e. , hilbert  schmidt ( hs ) operators on @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "every such operator has a unique weyl symbol @xmath5 so that eq .",
    "may be written as @xcite , @xcite @xmath6 the weyl symbol , a concept originating in quantum mechanics @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , is now a standard tool for the description of ltv systems @xcite ( because of its physical provenance , we shall often switch between variables @xmath7 and @xmath8 standing for time , angular frequency and the corresponding phase space coordinates ) .",
    "the operator , regarded as an ltv filter for finite - energy signals @xmath9 , will play a central role in our investigations .",
    "however , for the formulation of problems it will be necessary to replace @xmath0 with the operator @xmath10 having the _ spread _ weyl symbol @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the spreading factor .",
    ".   then turns into @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the kernel , now depending on @xmath15 .",
    "it is not difficult to express @xmath16 in terms of @xmath17 and @xmath15 ; however , we shall refrain from doing so here since the weyl symbol appears to be the appropriate filter description in our context .",
    "although other choices are possible for that symbol ( also called the time  frequency transfer function ; see @xcite for a systematic overview ) , the weyl symbol excels due to some unique properties , one of them being most helpful later on .",
    "there is one other choice for the description of ltv filters : the spreading function @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this is the two - dimensional ( symplectic ) fourier transform of , in our case , the weyl symbol @xmath18 , @xmath19 and its popularity in mobile communications comes from the fact that the representation @xmath20 allows a simple interpretation of the operator in terms of a weighted superposition of time delays @xmath21 and doppler shifts @xmath22 of the input signal . because of @xmath23 we observe increasing concentration of the spreading function @xmath24 of operator @xmath25 around the origin of the @xmath26-plane as @xmath27 .",
    "this behaviour , shared by many practical ltv filters and termed _ underspread _ in @xcite , @xcite , is therefore also peculiar to our setting ( where , in principle , @xmath15 tends to infinity ) .",
    "however , it remains to be remarked that the spreading function would not be the proper means for formulating the subsequent waterfilling theorems , theorem  [ wft1 ] and theorem  [ wft2 ] .",
    "the present paper evolves from previous work presented in @xcite .",
    "we now give a brief overview of the contributions of our paper with emphasis on extensions and modifications compared to @xcite ; for details , refer to the text .",
    "the ltv filters , initially arbitrary hs operators , are later restricted to those having weyl symbols in the schwartz space of rapidly decreasing functions ( thus including the bivariate gaussian function used in @xcite ) .",
    "the waterfilling theorem for the capacity of the ltv channel is now stated in terms of the reciprocal squared modulus of the spread weyl symbol of the ltv filter .",
    "similarly , the reverse waterfilling theorem for the rate distortion function for the nonstationary source is stated in terms of the squared modulus of the spread weyl symbol of the ltv filter .",
    "a major difference from @xcite is the statement of a new szeg theorem , which is now general enough to cover a large class of operators . for part of the proof of the szeg theorem we resort to a powerful asymptotic expansion having its roots in semiclassical physics @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "since our results are asymptotic in nature , there is a need to give a lower bound for the spreading factor so that the formulas in the waterfilling theorems yield useful approximations .",
    "a lower bound is suggested by means of the robertson  schrdinger uncertainty inequality @xcite .",
    "several concrete examples will illustrate our results .",
    "in the present section , we fix the notation and compile some mathematical concepts and results associated with the ltv filter . in section  [ sec_fundamentals ] , it will be sufficient to restrict ourselves to the spreading factor @xmath28 , therefore it is omitted ; generalizations to the case @xmath12 , mostly obvious , will be addressed as needed in the subsequent sections .",
    "the following notations will be adopted : the inner product in @xmath1 is denoted by @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is the corresponding norm . for an operator @xmath31 , its adjoint @xmath32 is defined by the condition @xmath33 ; @xmath34 is called self - adjoint if @xmath35 .",

    "if the function @xmath87 is differentiable up to the sixth order and it holds @xmath88 for all @xmath89 , then the operator @xmath34 defined by the weyl symbol @xmath90 is a _ bounded _ operator from @xmath1 into itself , and it holds @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 is a certain constant not depending on the operator .",
