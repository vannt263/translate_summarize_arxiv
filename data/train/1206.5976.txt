    "cosmological constant problem is a subject of numerous investigations @xcite .",
    "the fact of the matter is that the enormous energy of zero point quantum fluctuations of matter fields as well as electromagnetic and gravitational waves have to produce an enormous universe expansion , which is not seen in reality . at the same time",
    ", a study of conformal fluctuations also has a long history @xcite and is still far from the completion owing to lack of a developed theory of quantum gravity .",
    "a possible relation between these two problems has been considered in refs .",
    "it has been suggested that , since the conformal fluctuations formally give a negative contribution to the hamiltonian density , they can compensate an energy of the zero point fluctuations of matter fields , electromagnetic and gravitational waves . nevertheless , as was shown in @xcite , it is not the case , at least for the gravitational waves .",
    "the reason is that the scale ( conformal ) factor is attributed naturally to the slowly varying background , and thus , it can hardly be modulated by gravitational waves",
    ".    it should be added , that the decomposition of a metric into the conformal factor and a remaining part : @xmath0 seems very natural as it was suggested by york @xcite , who discussed properties of the conformal geometry given by @xmath1 .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the classical solutions of some simple models to determine a possibility of the scale factor modulation .",
    "this means that one explores some particular gauges and initial conditions , which result in an oscillating scale factor .",
    "this does not mean that the scale factor is an oscillating quantity under an arbitrary initial conditions .",
    "the aim of our work is to demonstrate , that the scale factor oscillations are not forbidden in general ( e.g. owing to constraints ) .",
    "although , we investigate local oscillations of the scale factor here , the models admitting global oscillations @xcite are also of general interest .",
    "the first model considered is a string against a curved background . for this model",
    "we have built a solution for which the scale factor is connected rigidly with the matter fields so that a mutual compensation of their fluctuations and , thereby , the solution of the cosmological constant problem look almost trivial .",

    "[ eqaexp ] the first statement of the theory considered reads that the spatially inhomogeneous part obeys the linear equations @xmath60 , and , in fact , is equivalent to the linearization considered above .",
    "this statement is not valid in our case , because the ripples of @xmath61 and @xmath24 are strongly nonlinear .",
    "the second statement reads that the evolution of background is determined by averaged terms of the second order in ripples : a_0(_0())=-<a_2(_0(),_1(x,))>.    it is a consequence of the averaging of eq .",
    "( [ eqaexp ] ) .",
    "let consider only single equation : the hamiltonian constraint ( [ hamcon ] ) .",
    "we substitute ( x,)=_0()+ _ 1(,x ) , + b(x,)=b_0()+b_1(,x ) , + v(x,)=v_0()+v_1(,x ) + into the hamiltonian constraint and obtain the second order contribution in the form of    h_2=e^2_0(2 _ 1 _ x b_1 b_0+e^4 b_0 ( + + + ( _ x b_1)^2 + + + ( _ xv_1)^2 + ( _ x _ 1)^2 + ) + ( _ x b_1)^2 + 2 _ 1 _ x v_1 v_0+ ( v_1^)^2 - 2 _ 1 _ 1^ _ 0 + - ( _ 1 ^)^2 + _ 1 ^ 2 ( ( b_0)^2 + ( v_0)^2- ( _ 0)^2 ) ) .    using the results of the previous numerical calculations ( sec . [ secn ] ) , one can see that the second statement of the isaacson s theory ( i.e. @xmath62 ) is satisfied with a high accuracy as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( a ) .",
    "let distinguish a  pure \" gravitational wave contribution h_2v = e^2_0 ( ( v_1^)^2 + ( _ xv_1)^2 ) in @xmath63 . as one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( b ) , the plot of @xmath64 is , in fact , symmetric relatively the time axis .",
    "this means that if one performs the time averaging in addition , then one can conclude that @xmath65 does not contribute  at the mean \" to the evolution of background , i.e. the evolution of background is determined by a  pure \" gravitational wave @xmath66 .",
    "why is the @xmath67-variable considered as that corresponding to a  pure \" gravitational wave ? to answer this question , one may use the description of a conformal three - geometry in the terms of the york curvature @xcite y^ab = g^1/3e^aef(r^b_f-^b_f r)_;e , where @xmath68 denotes the spatial part of the metric ( [ metric ] ) , @xmath69 is the ricci tensor of the three - metric @xmath68 , @xmath70 is the fully antisymmetric symbol and the @xmath71 means the covariant derivative over the metric @xmath68 .",
    "direct calculation gives the following result y^23= e^4 b ( 9 _ x b _ xxv+3 _ xv ( _ xxb+6 ( _ x b)^2 + -2 ( _ xv)^2)+_xxxv ) .   [ york ] other components of @xmath72 equal to zero .",
    "as can expect , the york curvature is conformally invariant , i.e. it does not depend on @xmath24 . from eq .",
    "( [ york ] ) , one can see that @xmath73 results in @xmath74 and the space becomes conformally flat .",
    "this justifies the consideration of the @xmath67-variable as representing a  pure \" gravitational wave .",
    "let compare the model considered with the well - known gowdy @xcite model described by the metric : ds^2=e^- t-/2(e^4 td t^2-dx^2)-e^2 t(e^2dy^2+e^-2dz^2 ) , where @xmath75 are the functions of @xmath76 only . denoting = v , + t = b+ , + = 6(b- ) , we come to the metric ds^2=e^2((e^2dt)^2-e^-4 bdx^2-e^2 b+2vdy^2 + -e^2 b-2vdz^2 ) , which is exactly the metric ( [ metric ] ) if the conformal time @xmath77 is used instead of @xmath78 .    for the gowdy model , it is shown that the function @xmath79 can be chosen as the function of the time @xmath78 only @xcite , and the function @xmath80 ceases to depend on @xmath26 at @xmath81 .",
    "thus , in principle , the ripples of @xmath82 found above can be eliminated by some coordinate transformation",
    ".    it should be noted , that , if the gauge invariance turns out to be violated in quantum theory , the ripples of the scale factor in the conformal time can appear .",
    "since , as it has been demonstrated above ( figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] , [ fig3 ] ) , the ripples consist of the sharp spikes , their spectrum will be broad and  noise - like \" .",
    "it should be taken into account , that such spikes have appeared when the bianchi i model was considered . as has been demonstrated in sec .",
    "[ seclin ] , the unstable rising modes exist for this model . in contrast , it is known , that the isotropic frw space - time is stable against small perturbations @xcite . thus ,",
    "for the isotropic space - time , the ripples could exist only in a strongly nonlinear regime and this issue needs a further analysis .    concerning a contribution of the ripples to the energy balance , one may conclude that such ripples occur in both string and bianchi i models .",
    "but , in the string model the ripples of the scale factor and the oscillations of the matter fields compensate mutually euch other and , thereby , the background evolution is not affected by them . for the bianchi i model , the results of sec .",
    "[ secis ] demonstrate that the ripples of the scale factor compensate only the oscillations of the @xmath61-field and the background evolution  at the mean \" becomes to be determined by the  pure \" gravitational wave @xmath67 in agreement with the results of @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , such a conclusion can become invalid in the quantum gravity case , since a strong gauge wave , consisting of the scale factor @xmath24 and the @xmath61-field could mixed up the gravitational waves and contribute to the background evolution , as well .    it should be noted , that both models ( i.e. the string and bianchi i ones ) have been considered on the classical level that can not shed a light on the solution of the vacuum energy problem .",
    "this results from the fact that a compensation of only zero - point fluctuations of matter fields is required in the quantum case .",
    "but in the classics , it is impossible to distinguish the fluctuations in the ground state from those in an excited state .",
