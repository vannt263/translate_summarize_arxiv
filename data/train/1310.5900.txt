    "recently globular clusters ( gcs ) in the galaxy were discovered to have chemical inhomogeneities .",
    "more specifically , @xcite showed that all gcs studied up to now have at least a spread ( or anticorrelation ) in the content of their light - elements o and na .",
    "indeed , they present a new definition of a gc as a cluster which exhibits such an anticorrelation , with the implication that all globulars , at least those above a certain mass limit , must posses this characteristic .",
    "many other light - elements such as c , n , mg , and al also show a spread or a ( anti)correlation .",
    "the na - o anticorrelation was found over the entire mass range observed , from ngc  6838 ( m=10@xmath4 m@xmath3 ) up to 47  tuc ( m=10@xmath5 m@xmath3 ) .",
    "this spread is probably due to the early evolution of each cluster , when a second generation of stars was born from gas polluted by ejecta of evolved stars of the first generation ( the so called multiple - population phenomenon , @xcite ) . according to this model",
    ", stars of the first ( older ) generation were born with normal he ( y@xmath10.25 ) and a na / o content similar to the field stars in the halo , while stars of the second ( younger ) generation , because of this self - enrichment , are he / na richer ( y@xmath60.25 , @xcite ) and o - poorer with respect to the first generation . several kinds of polluters have been proposed , including intermediate mass agb stars ( m@xmath74 - 8 m@xmath3 , @xcite ) , fast rotating massive stars ( m@xmath820 m@xmath3 , @xcite ) massive binaries stars ( m@xmath720 m@xmath3 , @xcite ) and novae @xcite . in some cases",
    "also sneii may have been at work @xcite .",
    "the first requirement for this process is that the initial mass of the cluster was high enough to retain both some primordial gas and the ejecta .",
    "the higher the initial mass , the higher the mass of the gas and ejecta that can be retained , and the more extended the abundance spread that is expected to be observed nowadays @xcite .",
    "subsequently , all clusters are expected to lose mass due to both internal and external processes .",
    "the nature of the most effective polluter changes with cluster mass , because more massive gcs can retain faster ejecta , including those from a sne explosion @xcite .",
    "this is the case for m22@xcite , @xmath9 centauri @xcite , and m54 @xcite , where spread in the @xmath0-element and iron content were found besides the usual light - element spread , indicating pollution by sneii .",
    "lower mass gcs can retain only slow winds , such as those from massive main sequence stars or intermediate mass agb stars where only light - element variation is expected ( as in the case of the standard globular cluster m4 , @xcite ) .",
    "below a certain mass threshold no ejecta are retained at all , so single population gcs are expected @xcite .",
    "indeed , searches for light element spreads in much lower mass open clusters have been negative @xcite , with the exception of ngc  6791 @xcite that , however , may not be a genuine member of this category @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that most of the stars currently found in a gc belong to the second generation ( @xmath160@xmath1080% ) .",
    "this is at odds with theory , which says that first generation stars must have been much more numerous than we observe nowadays in order to produce enough ejecta to form the second .",
    "this contradiction can be partially explained if we assume that ejecta were collected preferentially in the center of the cluster due to the gravitational potential .",
    "because of this the second generation was formed in the center and was much less affected by galactic tidal disruption than the first , which lost most of its members @xcite .",
    "this scenario holds also for old and intermediate - age massive clusters in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc , @xcite ) .",
    "the former are generally more massive than the latter and appear to mimic galactic gcs in having an extended na / o anticorrelation , while the latter only show some spread in na , with the possible exception of a single object ( see section 5 ) that is doubtful .",
    "for this reason @xcite reiterated that mass can be the key factor in determining chemical inhomogeneities .",
    "recently @xcite suggested the possibility of the existence of two types of single population gcs .",
    "the first is represented by clusters initially not massive enough to be able to retain primordial gas and ejecta from evolved stars and form a second generation of stars .",
    "the second is represented by massive clusters that retained almost all the first generation and so only a small fraction of the stars would belong to the second generation population .",
    "such clusters would preferentially be those that do not fill their tidal radius .",
    "these second are only pseudo - single population clusters , because the second generation of stars is just very small compared to the first generation , but still present .",
    "@xcite presented palomar 3 as a probable example of the first type because of the small color spread of its horizontal branch ( hb ) , of only @xmath10.25 mag in b - v ( see their fig .",
    "a key question is if there is any relatively massive globular cluster that is composed of only chemically homogeneous stars .",
    "such a cluster should be sought among the less massive globulars in the galaxy .",
    "for this reason we focused our investigation on ruprecht 106 ( m@xmath110@xmath11 m@xmath3 , @xcite ) .",
    "this cluster was first studied by @xcite who suggested an age 4 - 5 gyrs younger then the oldest halo gcs and a metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath1 - 2.0 based on photometric indicators .",
    "@xcite gave [ fe / h]@xmath1 - 1.6 , based on spectroscopic observations . according to the most recent work by @xcite ruprecht 106",
    "is a relatively old , metal - poor ( 11.5 gyrs , [ fe / h]@xmath1 - 1.5 ) gc with a solar scaled @xmath0-element content .",
    "we selected this cluster , apart from its low mass , for the small extension of its hb . according to @xcite ,",
    "the extension of the hb in a gc is proportional to the amount of helium variation due to self - pollution among its stars .",
    "he - normal stars are located in the redder part of the hb , while he - rich stars lie in the bluer part , as recently shown by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest that the best candidates for single population gcs are those with both stubby hbs for their metallicity and with m@xmath1210@xmath11 m@xmath3 .",
    "ruprecht 106 fulfills both of these characteristics but was not investigated by them .",
    "so an hb with a small extension may indicate no spread in helium ( or light - elements ) and the absence of the self - pollution phenomenon .",
    "in such a cluster only one generation ( the first ) should be present .",
    "it should also have a homogeneous content of all the other elements ( @xmath0 , iron - peak , s and r ) .",
    "the scenario is complicated by the fact that age and mass - loss are also involved .",
    "in fact a young cluster ( less then 10 gyrs ) could show no color spread on the hb ( that would appear entirely red ) but still have a variation in he just because hb stars do not have a low enough mass to be located in the blue part ( the younger the age , the higher the mean mass in the hb ) . on the other hand",
    "a differential mass - loss along the hb can generate a spread on the hb even if no he variation is present .",
    "ruprecht 106 is old and metal poor , so it should have a blue hb , or at least some of the hb stars should be located on the blue hb , as in m4 or ngc  6752 , two clusters with an extended and well studied na - o anticorrelation @xcite . in spite of this , @xcite show a cmd ( see fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) with only a red and slightly extended hb .",
    "the color baseline of the hb is @xmath10.2 mag , less than palomar 3 , which was proposed by @xcite as a probable single population cluster .",
    "for all these reasons we selected it as a good candidate single population gc . in order to prove if this is true , we analized spectra for a statistically significant sample of rgb stars and measured their chemical composition .",
    "if it indeed is a single population cluster we should observe a homogeneous content of all the elements , within the observational errors .    in section 2 we describe data reduction and in section 3 the methodology we used to obtain the chemical abundances . in section 4",
    "we present our results including a comparison with the literature . in section 5 and 6",
    "we discuss ruprecht 106 as a single population gc , and in section 7 we compare it with different formation environments ( galactic and extragalactic ) . finally in section 8 we give a summary of our findings .",
    "our dataset consists of high resolution spectra collected in 2002 and downloaded from the advanced data products eso archive .",
    "the spectra were obtained with the uves spectrograph , mounted at the vlt telescope .",
    "a total of 10 stars were observed between v=14.4 and v=16.5,from the rgb - bump up to the rgb - tip of the cluster ( see fig .",
    "all stars were observed with the blue and red arms of the spectrograph , and spectra cover a range of 37006800  . the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) is between 50 and 70 at 6000  .",
    "data were reduced using the dedicated pipeline ( see http://www.eso.org/sci/software/pipelines/ ) .",
    "data reduction includes bias subtraction , flat - field correction , wavelength calibration , sky subtraction , and spectral rectification .",
    "radial velocities were measured by the _ fxcor _",
    "package in iraf , using a synthetic spectrum as a template .",
    "one star turned out to have a very different radial velocity , and so was rejected as a non - member .",
    "the mean heliocentric value for our member targets is -38.4@xmath130.4 km / s .",
    "@xcite gives -44@xmath133 km / s .",

    "many authors ( @xcite , [ fe / h]@xmath1 - 2 ; @xcite , [ fe / h]=-1.90 ; @xcite , [ fe / h]=-1.69 ; @xcite , [ fe / h]=-1.9 ) who obtained a metallicity based on photometry ( slope and/or color of the rgb ) or low - resolution spectroscopy ( ca triplet or comparison with low - resolution synthetic spectra ) implicitly assumed a typical halo alpha - enhancement , as in all other galactic gcs . this fact led them to underestimate the cluster metallicity because ruprecht 106 simply is not @xmath0-enhanced , so , for a given metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) the rgb - slope is larger or low resolution spectra are apparently more metal - poor ( e.g. the eqw of the ca triplet is smaller ) with respect to any other gc with similar iron content . @xcite ( [ fe / h]=-1.45 ) instead obtained a more reliable result because they measured directly fe lines .",
    "their value is in excellent agreement with our .",
    "we measured neutron - capture elements from y to pb .",
    "they are produced through the capture of a neutron by a iron - peak seed nucleus .",
    "once captured , the neutron decays into a proton , and a new nucleus with higher atomic number is formed .",
    "the capture can is considered slow if the timescale for the neutron capture is large compared to the timescale of the nuclear decay . in this case",
    "we have the s - process . in the case",
    "that the neutron capture is rapid compared with the timescale of the decay , we have the r - process .",
    "the distribution of neutron - capture elements is different in the two cases , and a study of their relative abundance gives information on the relative importance of the two processes on the contamination of the gas the cluster was formed from . because the s - process happens in low - mass agb stars ( 1.5 - 3 m@xmath3 , @xcite ) , intermediate mass agb stars ( 4 - 8 m@xmath3 , @xcite ) , and",
    "possibly also in massive stars ( m@xmath820 m@xmath3 , @xcite ) , while the r - process most probably occurs in sneii explosions , abundances of neutron - capture elements tell us how these kind of stars contributed to the formation of the cluster . for this purpose in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] we plotted the abundance of ba , la , pr , nd , sm , eu , dy , and pb . on our data we superposed the two abundance curves of the pure s ( dashed black line ) and r ( continuous black line ) process taken from @xcite .",
    "ba and pb were used to set the zero - point of the pure s and pure r process curves ( see below ) , while la , pr , nd , sm , eu , and dy are those elements more sensitive to the s and r processes .",
    "the ce abundance does not follow any curve in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] , probably because of some non - negligible systematic error in our abundance estimation for this element , so we decided not to use it in our investigation .",
    "the two curves were shifted in the y direction in order to match the ba and pb abundances that are the same for the two processes .",
    "abundances of the other elements are in between the two curves and the best fitting line ( the blue continuous line ) indicates that r - process contributed 66% and s - process 34% to the cluster abundances . this result",

    "their na abundance is based on the 8190   doublet so , according to @xcite , a nlte correction of @xmath1 - 0.2 dex looks appropriate .",
    "the agreement with our results is good .",

    "[ t3 ] , where the theoretical spread ( @xmath31 ) matches very well within the errors with the observed spread ( @xmath32 ) both for o and na .",
    "this is true also for the other elements .",
    "this confirms our initial hypothesis that ruprecht 106 is the first example of a single population gc , although it is possible that nature has conspired against us and we simply did not detect a true spread",
    ". see below for further discussion of this point . recall that the na - o anticorrelation has been used to define a gc @xcite ,",
    "so its absence in ruprecht 106 is of particular importance",
    ".    however fig .",
    "[ f4 ] has several other interesting implications .",
    "first of all ruprecht 106 occupies a totally unique position in this diagram ( see section 7 for further discussion ) .",
    "in addition , among galactic gcs at least two distinct na - o anticorrelations appear , that are plotted as red lines .",
    "one is o - richer ( continuous line ) and represented by the trend of the stars in m4 and m22 , while the other is o - poorer ( dashed line ) and represented by the trend of the stars in ngc  1851 and ngc2808 .",
    "this fact can be explained by the @xmath0-enhancement a cluster was formed with and remembering that o is an @xmath0 element too . if first generation stars in a cluster were born relatively o - poor ( with respect to the continuous line of fig .",
    "[ f4 ] ) , second generation stars will also share the same chemical behavior .",
    "as an example , ngc  1851 and m4 have a difference in their @xmath0-enhancement of 0.07 dex ( as defined by the mean abundance of si and ca ) , while the difference between their o content is @xmath10.1 dex among the entire na - o anticorrelation .",
    "so the o content of second generation stars does not depend only on the internal chemical evolution of the clusters , but also on the primordial o abundance of the progenitor cloud .",
    "old lmc clusters also follow the general galactic trend , but this is not the case for intermediate - age lmc clusters and terzan 7 which do not show an appreciable spread in o. on the other hand three of them show a possible spread in na ( ngc  1651 : open green circles , ngc  1978 : green crosses , ngc  2173 : open green stars ) .",
    "ngc  1978 also shows a hint of a na - o anticorrelation .",
    "only two clusters ( ngc  1783 : open green squares ) and terzan 7 have a small dispersion in na , possibly compatible with zero , but still larger then ruprecht 106 , but all of these samples are relatively small .    in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] the region presumably inhabited by first generation stars in galactic and lmc globular cluster is indicated by a large black circle .",
    "even if ruprecht 106 does not fit at all with any known milky way or lmc cluster , we can still state that these stars still correspond to the first generation .",
    "this is because this first generation is characterized by the fact that [ o / fe]=[@xmath0/fe ] within 0.1 dex ( where @xmath0 is defined as the mean abundance of si and ca ) .",
    "second generations stars have [ o / fe]@xmath12[@xmath0/fe ] . as an example , in m4 stars of the first generation ( [ @xmath0/fe]=+0.42 ) have [ o / fe]=+0.42 dex , while stars of the second have [ o / fe]=+0.25 ( the difference with respect the @xmath0-enhancement is -0.17 dex ) .",
    "this behavior is expected because the first generation was born from fresh material , enhanced in all @xmath0-elements , including o. instead the second generation was born from o - depleted material , which however had other @xmath0-elements untouched . for ruprecht 106 we found that the o content is only slightly lower than other @xmath0-elements ( 0.07 dex ) , so we can say that the observed stars correspond to the first generation . with this information we can answer the following question : what is the probability that we have missed a second generation if present ?",
    "@xcite found that @xmath130 - 40% of stars now remaining in a gc belong to the first generation .",
    "we observed 9 stars and all belong to it .",
    "so the probability that we have missed the second population is :    p@xmath10.35@xmath64=0.00008=0.008%    this probability is low enough to confidently state that we did not miss any cluster sub - population",
    ". this would be true ( however not in as clear a way ) also if our stars had belonged to the second generation , for which we would obtain p=2% .",
    "however , we recognize that our sample is still small , especially compared to the samples generally used to define the na - o anticorrelation often with @xmath8100 stars . spectra of additional stars in ruprecht 106 would be most welcome .",
    "another relevant piece of evidence comes from the hb .",
    "it has a dispersion in color of @xmath10.2 mag ( see fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) . according to @xcite a dispersion of 0.3 mag or lower is an indication that no multiple populations are present in a cluster .",
    "so this fact further reinforces our main result .",
    "the last possibility could be that rup 106 represents one of those first generation - mainly clusters , where a second generation is present but not dominant @xcite .",
    "however in this case we should still see a hb extended to the blue because second generation hb stars populate a hotter and bluer hb part than first generation stars as discussed in the introduction . in rup 106",
    "this would correspond to hb stars with ( v - i)@xmath120.5 ( see fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) , where no stars at all are present . on the other hand",
    "the chances that rup 106 is such an object are decreased by the fact that first generation - mainly clusters are assumed to not have filled their tidal radius and thus did not lose many first generation stars .",
    "however , odds with this , rup 106 is known to be a tidally - filling cluster @xcite . in conclusion",
    ", the evidence strongly points to rup 106 asa first generation only cluster .    considering the above factors ,",
    "we conclude that it is very likely that ruprecht 106 is the first confirmed example of a single population , globular cluster .",
    "what about other possible candidates ?",
    "one is palomar 3 .",
    "@xcite suggested it as a single population cluster based on its hb , that has a color spread of 0.25 mag ( see their fig .",
    "2 ) . for ruprecht 106",
    "instead we found a value @xmath650.20 mag ( see fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) . on the spectroscopic side",
    ", @xcite found that the observed na spread in palomar 3 slightly exceeds that expected from theoretical errors and is not accompanied by a spread in o. this is not surprising because palomar 3 stars are located in a region of the na - o anticorrelation where little or no o variation is expected . in our opinion , these results together suggest that palomar 3 has a small but real spread in light elements , and it is therefore probably not an example of a single population gc .",
    "in addition only 4 stars have been observed at high resolution .",
    "on the other hand , ngc  1783 and terzan 7 have a dispersion in na of 0.10 and 0.12 dex respectively , larger then ruprecht 106 , but that could be due to larger internal errors .",
    "so they could be single population gcs . in any case for these three clusters further investigation",
    "is required to reveal their nature . obviously , it is of interest to observe other possible candidate single - population gcs .",
    "we finally note that these candidates are extragalactic or , in the case of palomar 3 , probably have an extragalactic origin @xcite .",
    "this is true also for ruprecht 106 ( see next section ) .",
    "a possible reason could be that all low mass single population galactic gc were destroyed due to the tidal interaction with the milky way , or simply they did not form at all .",
    "however , most low mass gcs have not been adequately investigated yet .",
    "it now well known that the u filter is able to disentagle multiple populations along the rgb of globular clusters @xcite due to its sensitivity to chemical inhomogeneities . for this purpose we extracted photometric material for ruprecht 106 from the eso public archive .",
    "it consists of a series of images in ubvri taken with the superb seeing imager ( susi2 ) at la silla observatory on the night of july 21 , 2002 .",
    "the detector has a scale of 0.08 arcsec / pixel , allowing to cover 5.5@xmath665.4 arcmin on the sky .",
    "this data - set has the widest optical wavelength coverage for ruprecht 106 available , and it is ideal to study the detailed shape of the red giant branch .",
    "the night was photometric according to the weather report from eso la silla , with an average seeing of 0.8 arcsec in the v pass - bands .",
    "exposures range from 30 to 900 in u , b , v , and r. the cluster was also observed in i , but the images show significant fringing , which made it impossible to extract good photometry . only the north - east portion of the cluster was surveyed .",
    "after pre - reduction ( bias and flat - field corrections ) images have been reduced using the daophot / allstar routines .",
    "susi2 has two detectors , which have been separated and reduced individually .",
    "the two extracted catalogs have then been merged . to tie the instrumental photometry to the standard system we used the average zero - points and color terms reported in the website of the instrument ..    in fig .",
    "[ f5b ] we present a zoom on the rgb region in 2 different color combinations : v vs. u - r in the upper panel , and v vs. b - r in the lower , to maximize the color range of the stars .",
    "the v vs. b - r combination was included as a reference only , because colors other than u are not as sensitive to chemical inhomogeneities .",
    "we use the metallicity derived in this paper to fit the star distribution with theoretical isochrones ( red lines ) from the padova database @xcite .",
    "we find that the best - fitting parameters are an age of 12 gyrs , a reddening e(b - v ) = 0.19 , and an apparent distance modulus ( m - m)@xmath30= 17.20 mag .",
    "both reddening and distance modulus are in good agreement with the literature value .",
    "color - coded in blue is the region where bona - fine rgb stars are located . lacking any quantitative membership ,",
    "these have been selected as the rgb stars lying within the cluster core region ( core radius=1.0 arcmin , @xcite ) .",
    "photometric errors , in magnitude and color , are also indicated with error - bars color - coded in black . to investigate a possible intrinsic photometric spread in the rgb",
    ", we compared its observed color scatter with the natural width expected from considering the photometric errors only .",
    "these are calculated as    @xmath67 @xmath68    depending on the cmd . as for the observed color scatter at a given v",
    ", we simply consider the difference in color @xmath69 , and @xmath70 between the two most separated stars in the rgb at about the same v. this is because the rgb is not very rich , and therefore any other statistical calculation would be not robust .",
    "the results for 4 different v magnitudes are reported directly in the figure as @xmath33/@xmath14 with their errors .",
    "apart from the value at v = 17 , where no rgb stars are located , the ratios are compatible with 1 within the errors , indicating that the rgb is not wider than the amount expected from photometric errors only .",
    "we therefore conclude that this photometric dataset supports the spectroscopic result that no significant spread exists among ruprecht 106 rgb stars",
    ".    we can further compare our ( u - r ) vs. v cmd with that for m4 ( * ? ? ? * ( u - b ) vs u , fig .",

    "there are a few examples where no spread was found , but those results are doubtful due to the small sample of stars observed and to the lack of an accurate error analysis .",
    "we analyzed 9 member stars and performed an accurate error abundance analysis .",
    "we found that the observed spread in all elements , in particular na and o , is totally within the measurement errors .",
    "we calculated also a negligible probability of having missed stars with an intrinsic difference in their chemical content with respect to our targets given the nominal ratio of first to second generation stars .",
    "this is also confirmed by the small color spread of the hb .",
    "no intrinsic abundance spread is present in this gc in any element .",
    "although our sample is still relatively small and more observations would be of great interest , our evidence strongly suggests that ruprecht 106 is the first genuine old , massive gc with only a single population .      *",
    "ruprecht 106 has [ fe / h]@xmath1 - 1.5 and [ @xmath0/fe]@xmath10.0 .",
    "this solves the disagreement in the literature between metallicity measurements based on photometry or low resolution spectroscopy and those based on high resolution spectroscopy .",
    "* its neutron - capture element abundances point toward a contamination of the gas the cluster was formed from by both the s and r processes .",
    "the contamination fraction is @xmath130% and 70% respectively .",
    "* ngc  1783 , terzan 7 , and palomar 3 are candidate single population gcs .",
    "available data are uncertain and new more accurate studies are required to confirm their nature .",
    "* na / o , @xmath0 , and iron - peak abundances clearly point toward an extragalactic origin of the cluster . no progenitor galaxy or stream",
    "have been clearly identified yet .",
    "ruprecht 106 has a present day mass of m=10@xmath2 m@xmath3 .",
    "this is not its initial mass because it lost a fraction of its stars due to internal precesses and to interaction with the milky way",
    ". a determination of the initial mass would require the knowledge of its orbit and a detailed dynamical simulation .",
    "this is beyond the scope of this paper . in any case",
    "we can fix m=10@xmath2 m@xmath3 as a lower limit for the initial mass threshold below which no ejecta are retained by the gravitational potential of a cluster and no second generation of stars is formed .",
    "note that ngc  6838 , one of the @xcite sample clusters , has a present day mass of m=10@xmath4 m@xmath3 , much less than that of ruprecht 106 , but shows a real na - o spread .",
    "we hypothesize that ngc  6838 was originally more massive than ruprecht 106 , but subsequently lost more mass .",
