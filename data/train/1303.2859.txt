    "short timescale is omitted here due to the resemblance to previous studies @xcite .",
    "the most striking feature in this figure is the extreme variations in conductance fluctuations among the three geometries .",
    "this effect can only originate from the difference in band structure of the contacts because all other parameters are kept fixed .",
    "we should point out that the slight difference between the kondo temperature of ( 111 ) pyramide and the other two geometries does not change the relative behaviour of the fluctuations for these geometries because @xmath66 scaling has been shown to alter only the amplitude of the fluctuations @xcite .",

    "these fluctuations are obviously the result of an admixture of sinusoidal oscillations with different frequencies and amplitudes .",
    "fourier transform of the instantaneous conductance gives each frequency component .",
    "it turns out that the frequencies are proportional to the separation between the peak positions and the fermi level for all cases .",
    "this is precisely why instantaneous current for ( 001 ) surface exhibits a more erratic pattern compared to the others as five distinct frequencies contribute to it .",
    "moreover , there are other peaks that appear in actual dft data but they were excluded from our fitting since they have negligible contribution to the fluctuation pattern . the oscillation amplitude associated with them is quite small to cause a noticable effect because they are either located far away from the fermi level or the peaks are not prominent compared to the surrounding features .    a microscopic mechanism for these instantaneous conductance results can be inferred with the aid of the evolution of the dot density of states . based on the fact that discontinuities in the density of states of the contacts can interfere with the kondo resonance when @xmath67 @xcite , we propose that the fluctuations in time dependent conductance stem from the interference between the emerging kondo resonance at the fermi level and the sharp features in the density of states . despite the static nature of the sharp features , the kondo resonance evolves in time in a dynamical way .",
    "consequently , the fluctuations continue until the kondo resonance is fully formed .",
    "furthermore , the reduction of oscillation amplitudes with increasing source - drain bias is related to the destruction of the kondo resonance which diminishes the interference .",
    "this scenario is also supported by the saturation of oscillation amplitudes below the kondo temperature because the kondo resonance is fully developed below this energy scale .",
    "consequently , the interference strength does not change upon lowering the ambient temperature any further .",

    "the technical details of this implementation can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we will again consider the ramifications of the sudden motion of the dot level from a position well below the fermi level to a position where the kondo effect is present with a gate voltage .",

    "the steady state conductances ( i.e. @xmath73 ) are smaller than the case for @xmath68=0 in fig .",
    "[ jpcm2 ] for all temperatures .",
    "this is simply because the electron - phonon coupling gradually suppresses the kondo resonance @xcite .",
    "this suppression has been attributed to the downward shift of the energy level due to the phonon reorganization .",
    "this originates from the renormalization of the dot level .",
    "another subtlety is the sinusoidal oscillations of the instantaneous conductance in the kondo timescale .",

    "these oscillations are not related to the formation of the kondo resonance because spin - flip processes are yet to begin here .",

    "it then starts decreasing and approaches zero for large @xmath68 values .",
    "furthermore , we see that lowering temperature results in larger oscillation amplitudes for all @xmath68 values .",
    "our calculations at other temperatures showed that this conclusion is general and valid for other ambient temperatures too .",
    "we propose the interference between the main kondo resonance and its phonon sidebands as the underlying microspopic mechanism for the sinusoidal oscillations seen in the instantaneous conductance in the kondo timescale .",
    "previous investigations demonstrated clearly that the phonon sidebands are separated from the main kondo peak by an integer multiple of phonon frequency @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "that is why the frequency of oscillations always turns out to be equal to @xmath74 . for a given @xmath68 ,",
    "the amplitude of oscillations increases with decreasing ambient temperature because both the main kondo peak and its phonon satellites are more robust .",
    "consequently , interference between them is stronger . when @xmath68=0 , the amplitude of oscillations is zero because phonon sidebands do not exist in this limit .",
    "even though the main kondo peak is quenched somewhat for small @xmath68 , its phonon sidebands become slightly more pronounced @xcite , thus the amplitude of oscillations starts to grow .",

    "this means that t@xmath93 throughout this oscillation and consequently the thermopower manages to stay in positive territory .",
    "it is zero at the furthest position of the dot level from the fermi level since the density of states vanishes around the fermi level .",
    "it then slowly starts to increase as the dot level approaches the fermi level because the tail of the breit - wigner resonance starts to touch the fermi level giving rise to a negative slope .",
    "thermopower hits a peak positive value when the dot level is closest to the fermi level .",
    "thermopower starts to decrease as the dot level starts to move away .",
    "the lack of sensitivity to ambient temperature for this driving amplitude is related to the absence of kondo resonance everywhere in this motion .",
    "boosting the driving amplitude to 2.5@xmath81 makes the oscillation of the dot energy level cover a larger energy range .",
    "the instantaneous thermopower initially follows the curve obtained for 2.0@xmath81 .",
    "nevertheless , it begins to deviate considerably when the dot level approaches the fermi level due to the emergence of the kondo resonance .",
    "this implies a shift in slope of the density of states of the dot accompanied by a change in sign of the thermopower . when the dot level is at its closest point to the fermi level , thermopower reaches a bottom since the kondo resonance is in its most developed shape at that point .",
    "when the dot level starts to move away from the fermi level , the kondo resonance disappears gradually , hence the thermopower climbs out of the bottom becoming positive after a while .",
    "the instantaneous thermopower curve is quite similar for the largest driving amplitude of 3.0@xmath81 except two differences .",
    "the instantaneous thermopower dips lower and earlier into negative region simply because the dot energy level is closer to the fermi level at any given time .",
    "the evolution of the kondo resonance is also the underlying factor behind the saturation of the time averaged thermopower at low driving frequencies .",
    "as the driving frequency is lowered , the dot energy level finds the chance to spend more time near the fermi level with decreasing driving frequency .",
    "since the formation of the kondo resonance requires long time @xcite , this sets aside more time for the kondo resonance to develop . as a result",
    ", time averaged thermopower grows in negative territory until it saturates below a certain driving frequency .",
    "saturation stems from the allocation of sufficient time for the full development of the kondo resonance .",
    "finally , we want to elaborate on the dependence of the time averaged thermopower on temperature . both fig .",
    "[ prl4 ] and fig .",
    "[ prl5 ] reveal that the difference between the time averaged values at the same driving frequency increases with decreasing driving frequency before saturating below a certain frequency .",
    "this underpins the significance of the development of the kondo resonance .",
    "the lack of sensitivity of time averaged thermopower to ambient temperature at elevated driving frequencies stems from the insufficient time allocated to the dot level to spend around the fermi level .",
    "this prevents the development of the kondo resonance to its full extent .",
    "as the driving frequency is reduced , the difference becomes more discernible with decreasing driving frequency until it saturates at some point because the kondo resonance is fully developed below that frequency .",

    "[ sec : designer ] , we demonstrated that the discontinuities in the density of states of the electrodes can induce oscillations in the transient current whose frequency is proportional to the energetic separation between the fermi level and the position of the discontinuity .",
    "strong electron - phonon coupling on the dot has been shown in section  [ sec : vibrating ] to give rise to oscillations in transient current whose frequency is equal to the phonon frequency . finally , we investigated the evolution of seebeck coefficient or thermopower in section  [ sec : thermal ] . for the case where the dot level is abruptly changed",
    ", we determined that the decay time of thermopower to its steady state value saturates below the kondo temperature . on the other hand , the instantaneous thermopower dips into negative region if the driving amplitude is ramped up such that the kondo resonance finds time to develop .",
