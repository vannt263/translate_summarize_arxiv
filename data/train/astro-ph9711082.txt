    "the detection of co and dust at millimeter wavelength in a few prominent objects at very large redshift opens the possibility to study the molecular gas of the primordial starbursts of galaxies .",
    "the initial detection of co in firas10214 + 4724 at @xmath9 ( brown and vanden bout 1992 , solomon et al 1992 ) , followed by co detections in h1413 + 117 ( the cloverleaf ) at @xmath10 ( barvainis et al 1994 ) , br  1202 - 0725 at @xmath11 ( ohta et al 1996 , omont et al 1996a ) and , recently , in 53w002 at @xmath12 ( scoville et al 1997 ) .",
    "in addition thermal emission has now been convincingly detected at 1.3 mm in @xmath138 @xmath14 qsos ( barvainis et al 1992 ; mcmahon et al 1994 , isaak et al 1994 , ivison , 1995 , omont et al 1996b ) and in one radiogalaxy at @xmath15 ( dunlop et al 1992 , chini & krgel 1994 ; hughes et al 1997 ) .",
    "such a jump in the redshift range of millimeter radioastronomy was made possible by  : i ) the existence at larger redshifts of extraordinary objects with molecular gas , dust and huge starbursts similar to the most powerful ultra - luminous iras galaxies ; ii ) the large increase of dust and co luminosities with redshift when observed at fixed wavelength ; iii ) the existence of a spectacular gravitational lensing amplification in the two prominent cases of firas10214 + 4724 and h1413 + 117 . however , since some tentative detections of quasars and quasar absorption line systems have not been confirmed ( wiklind & combes , 1994 ; braine , downes & guilloteau , 1996 ) , the number of detections of co at @xmath14 remains small , consisting of the four detections previously mentioned .",
    "it is important to extend the number of co detections at large redshift so that we can study more systematically : the nature of these sources , the properties of and the relative amount of molecular gas and dust , the spatial distribution of co and dust , the role of gravitational amplification , and the spatial extension of their millimeter emission ( e.g. is the extension observed in br  1202 - 0725 unique ? )    in order to address these issues , we have adopted the following strategy : i ) search for dust emission toward radio - quiet quasars at very high redshift in the millimeter or submillimeter ranges using single dish telescopes ; ii ) for the sources detected , systematically search for co and map the continuum with the iram interferometer . among the detections reported by omont",
    "et al ( 1996b ) , the most obvious candidate to search for co with the interferometer was bri  1335 - 0415 , an optically selected @xmath16 qso from the apm multicolour quasar survey ( irwin et al 1991 , storrie - lombardi et al 1996 ) .",
    "it is the second source with @xmath17 with the strongest 1.3 mm dust emission after br  1202 - 0725 ( omont et al 1996b ) .",
    "we report in this letter the detection of co(5 - 4 ) in bri  1335 - 0415 with an intensity comparable to that of br  1202 - 0725 .",
    "because of the relatively small instantaneous bandwidth of available heterodyne receivers ( 500mhz at 105ghz , i.e. 1400 km  s@xmath4 or @xmath18 at @xmath19 , a prerequisite for co observations is a precise determination of the the redshift of the target object .    in the case of high redshift quasars",
    "the redshifts have to be determined from rest frame ultra - violet emission lines ( e.g. ly-@xmath20:1216 , cv:1549 ) with widths of @xmath1310,000 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "moreover , it is well established that the above high ionization lines show systematic differences when compared with redshifts derived from lower ionization lines ( carswell et al 1991 , tytler & fan 1992 ) .",
    "espey et al ( 1990 ) give a mean redshift difference of 1000  km  s@xmath4 in @xmath21 quasars .",
    "of particular relevance to this work , storrie - lombardi et al ( 1996 ) find 430@xmath560  km  s@xmath4 for the apm sample of @xmath17 quasars .",
    "the error quoted above is the uncertainty in the mean and the actual dispersion(1@xmath22 ) about the above value is 1260  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "we have made an independent redetermination of the redshift of bri  1335@xmath230415 using the same data as storrie - lombardi et al ( 1996 ) .",
    "the c  iv line gives @xmath24 and the si  iv line @xmath25 , while the low ionisation lines o  i and c  ii give @xmath26 and 4.426 , respectively .",
    "however , the o  i and c  ii measurements are certainly not as reliable as the si  iv and c  iv ones , as the former lines are quite weak .",
    "therefore , from the emission lines , one can just estimate that the redshift should lie in the broad range 4.3704.426 .",
    "however , as in the case of br  1202 - 0725 ( isaak et al 1994 ) another indication can be derived from the absorption lines at redshifts close to that of the quasar . on the line of sight of bri  1335 - 0415 , there is a lyman limit system ( lls ) quite close to the quasar redshift ( storrie - lombardi et al 1994 , 1996 ) with an estimated h  i column density of the order of 10@xmath27  @xmath28 its redshift can be established from the presence of the c  ii @xmath29 and si  ii @xmath30 lines detected at @xmath31 and 4.406 , respectively .",
    "there is no doubt that these lines are due to the lls .",
    "in addition , there is a strong ly@xmath20 line at @xmath32   , i.e. @xmath33 . these facts confirm that the lls is at @xmath34 .",
    "this value can appear as one of the best guess for an approximate value of the redshift of the quasar .",
    "lyman - limit absorption systems so close to the redshift of the quasar are rare and only occur within 4000 km  s@xmath4 in 2 of 15 quasar sight lines studied by storrie - lombardi et al ( 1996 ) .",
    "observations were made with the iram interferometer between may 1996 and march 1997 .",
    "we used the standard cd configuration , which gives a beam of @xmath35 at pa 24@xmath36 at 1.35 mm and @xmath37 at 3 mm .",
    "dual frequency receivers were used to search simultaneously for co(5 - 4 ) emission at 3 mm and dust emission at 1.35 mm .",
    "two different tunings , separated by 450 mhz , were used at 3 mm , at 107.020 ghz and 106.570 ghz to provide wide velocity coverage .",
    "the 3 mm receivers were tuned in single sideband and the 1.35 mm receivers in double sideband ( at 223 ghz lsb and 226 ghz usb ) .",
    "typical ssb system temperature were @xmath38  k at 3 mm and @xmath39  k at 1.35 mm .",
    "amplitude and phase calibration were done using 3c273 , whose flux raised from 19 to 23 jy at 106 ghz , and 15 to 19 jy at 224 ghz during that period .",
    "flux density scale is accurate to better than 10% .",
    "phase noise was below 30@xmath36 on all baselines even at 1.35 mm .",
    "the final results are presented in figs.1 - 3 .",
    "the total integration time is about 10 hours for the co(54 ) line , and 18 hours for the 1.35 mm continuum .    at 1.35 mm",
    ", we detected a total flux of @xmath40  mjy ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the continuum source position is offset by ( @xmath41 ) from the optical position ( ra @xmath42 dec @xmath43 j2000.0 ) , well within the astrometric uncertainty of both measurements .",
    "the source appears only marginally resolved , with a formal gaussian size of @xmath44 .",
    "this could be purely a seeing effect .",
    "while the setting at 107.020 ghz only yields an upper limit of 1.2 mjy ( 3 @xmath22 ) on the 3 mm continuum , the co(5 - 4 ) line ( @xmath45=576.2677  ghz ) is clearly detected towards the position of the continuum emission .",
    "the co(54 ) line is found at a frequency of 106.570  ghz , corresponding to a redshift of @xmath46 .",
    "the spectrum is displayed in fig .  2 , and maps over 150 mhz wide channels are shown in fig .",
    "the integrated line flux is @xmath47  jy  km  s@xmath4 with a line width of @xmath48  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "the broad channel maps of the co(54 ) line ( fig .",
    "3 ) show marginal evidence for extension and/or position shift with velocity . the first contour ( 2  @xmath22 levels )",
    "is clearly extended in the central channel centered at 106.57 ghz , whereas the 2  @xmath22 contour is seen towards the east in the channel at 106.42 ghz . in both channels ,",
    "the emission extends about one beam away from the peak emission .",
    "however , it is difficult to decide with the present signal to noise ratio whether this result is really significant .",
    "there is no doubt about the reality of the co detection in bri  1335 - 0415 : the signal - to - noise ratio is high , especially on the integrated intensity .",
    "the profile , as well as the baseline , is very well behaved .",
    "the coincidence with the qso position and the absence of signal elsewhere ( fig.[fig:2 ] ) further strengthens the reality of the detection .",
    "the lack of pure continuum emission when all the 3-mm broad band measurements , except in the line frequency range , are included , indicates that the detected 3 mm emission comes from a spectral line ( fig.[fig:3 ] ) .",
    "the width of 420 km  s@xmath4 is in the range of , although slightly larger than , the values observed for other high  redshift sources  : 200 - 350 km  s@xmath4 for br  1202 - 0725 ( omont et al 1996a ) , 220 km  s@xmath4 in f10214 + 4724 ( solomon et al 1992 ) , 330 km  s@xmath4 in h1413 + 117 ( barvainis et al 1994 ) , from 150 to 550 km  s@xmath4 for a sample of 37 ultraluminous galaxies ( solomon et al 1997 ) .",
    "the derived redshift for the molecular gas is just in the redshift range derived from optical emission lines , in the upper part as expected , close to the low ionisation lines .",
    "indeed , it is practically coincident with the redshift of the lyman limit absorption system ( lls )",
    ". it will be important to obtain a better redshift for this lyman limit system to see if the redshift agrees more closely with the co.    the integrated co intensity of bri  1335 - 0415 ( 2.8 jy km  s@xmath4 ) is slightly stronger than for br  1202 - 0725 ( 2.4 jy km  s@xmath4 ) which is at a similar redshift .",
    "as in other sources ( see , e.g. , omont et al 1996a ) , several approximations are required to estimate the mass of molecular hydrogen in bri  1335 - 0415 from the co intensity . assuming a relatively high rotational temperature demonstrated in other sources by the co line ratios , and using the same conversion factor as in omont et al ( 1996a ) for the mass of molecular hydrogen from the ( 5 - 4 ) line luminosity ( see solomon et al 1992 ) , we obtain @xmath49 where h  =  h@xmath50/100 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 and adopting q@xmath50  =  0.5 .",
    "this is similar to the value derived for br  1202 - 0725 in omont et al ( 1996a ) .",
    "however , this h@xmath6 mass could be overestimated as in the case of ultraluminous ir galaxies with comparable co luminosities where the h@xmath6 masses , derived as above , are too high by a factor 3 ( solomon et al 1997 , downes et al 1993 ) .",
    "the measured total continuum flux at 1.35 mm ( @xmath40  mjy ) , is consistent with the value measured at an effective wavelength of @xmath131.25 mm at the iram 30m with the bolometer receivers ( @xmath51  mjy ) , when the high spectral index ( 3.54 ) of the thermal dust emission is taken into account .",
    "however , it is strange that the ratio of the 1.35 mm fluxes of br  1202 - 0725 and bri  1335 - 0415 as measured with the interferometer ( omont et al 1996a and this paper ) is 2.8@xmath50.4 , while the ratio of the 1.25 mm fluxes measured with the 30m telescope is 1.2@xmath50.2 ( omont et al 1996b ) .",
    "it is important to understand why there is such a difference .",
    "differences in the dust temperature or a range in the dust to molecular gas ratio are two possibilites that can be addressed by further observations . finally ,",
    "although the present 30m and interferometer values for the continuum flux of bri  1335 - 0415 are consistent , the smaller flux measured with the interferometer could indicate that the interferometric observations miss a weak extended component of the emission .    in several other aspects ,",
    "bri  1335 - 0415 appears notably different from other high @xmath52 sources , and especially from br  1202 - 0725 .",
    "first there is no evidence for a large extension of the 1.35  mm continuum emission with respect to the 2@xmath53 beam ( fig .  1 ) , while in br  1202 - 0725 there is another strong component 4@xmath53 away from the qso . a priori , in bri  1335@xmath230415",
    "there is no indication of gravitational lensing as is clearly the case for f10214 + 4724 and h1413 + 117 .",
    "second , the line of sight of bri  1335 - 0415 also appears less rich in absorption systems than br  1202 - 0725 .",
    "storrie - lombardi et al ( 1996 ) report @xmath1310 unique intervening redshift systems in br  1202 - 0725 whereas in the case of the bri  1335@xmath230415 they report only 2 such systems , i.e. the @xmath54 lyman - limit system discussed above and a strong mg  ii / fe  ii system at @xmath55 .",
    "with a co intensity comparable to that of br  1202 - 0725 , bri  1335 - 0415 is another exceptional object at redshift larger than 4 .",
    "if the absence of strong gravitational magnification is firmly established , it could have one of the largest mass of molecular gas known , @xmath56m@xmath8 .",
    "such a large mass of molecular gas probably indicates a huge starburst , possibly associated to the formation of the core of an elliptical galaxy or bulge of a massive spiral galaxy .",
    "the coincidence of the redshifts shows that the co emission and the lyman limit absorption system may pertain to the same object , possibly the host galaxy of the qso .",
    "if so a more detailed chemical analysis of the absorption line system would be very interesting since it would allow a determination of the metallicity of the interstellar medium in this quasar s host galaxy .",
    "contrary to br  1202 - 0725 , neither the 1.35  mm emission , nor the co emission display a strong extension at a scale of several arcseconds .",
    "however , there is an indication of a weak extension of the co emission which should be confirmed",
    ". it would also be interesting to further compare the continuum 1.3 mm continuum flux measured with the iram 30m telescope and interferometer .",
    "although the present values are consistent , it is not excluded that the smaller flux measured with the interferometer could indicate that it misses a weak extended component of the emission",
    ". it will also be important to understand why the ratio of the co intensity to the 1.35  mm interferometer flux is three times larger in bri  1335 - 0715 than in br  1202 - 0725 .",
    "this work was carried out in the context of eara , a european association for research in astronomy .",
