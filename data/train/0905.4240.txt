    "the wigner @xmath0-symbol is used in the recoupling of three angular momenta , and finds many applications in atomic , molecular and nuclear physics .",
    "these are explained in standard references on angular momentum theory@xcite .",
    "for example , the @xmath2-symbols and their asymptotic properties are central to certain algorithms for the calculation of scattering amplitudes in three - body interactions ( de  fazio et al@xcite , anderson and aquilanti@xcite ) .",
    "these methods make use of the relationship between the @xmath2-symbols and discrete orthogonal polynomials ( aquilanti et al@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the @xmath0-symbol possesses a remarkable semiclassical approximation , first obtained by ponzano and regge@xcite through some inspired guesswork , that is linked in a highly symmetrical manner to the geometry of a tetrahedron in three - dimensional space .",
    "this formula was first proven rigorously by schulten and gordon@xcite , who also gave practical means of computing the @xmath0-symbol by recursion relations .",
    "more recently the @xmath0-symbol has attracted attention for the role it plays in quantum gravity , which has led to more geometrical treatments of its asymptotic properties .",
    "references in this area include roberts@xcite and charles@xcite .",
    "the formula of ponzano and regge has the usual properties of primitive semiclassical approximations , for example , it diverges at the classical turning points ( the caustics ) .",
    "since the @xmath0-symbol is only defined for discrete values of the quantum numbers , it is unlikely to fall exactly on a caustic , but it can come very close , and the ponzano - regge formula does not provide a good approximation for such values . thus there is interest in uniform approximations that do not suffer from caustic singularities and that are valid over as wide a range of quantum numbers as possible .",
    "in addition to proving the ponzano - regge formula for the @xmath0-symbol , schulten and gordon also provided uniform asymptotic approximations of the airy - function type that are valid in a region passing through a turning point .",
    "the @xmath0-symbol , however , has two turning points when one of the @xmath3 s is varied and the others held fixed , in a manner reminiscent of an ordinary oscillator in one dimension .",
    "the airy - function uniform approximation can only cover one of these at a time , and if two airy - function approximations are used , then they do not match smoothly in the middle .",
    "this suggests that a uniform approximation of the weber - function type ( one based on harmonic oscillator wave functions ) should be used , that would cover both turning points at once .",
    "it turns out , however , that this can not be done , in general .",
    "an idea of why this is so is given by fig .",
    "[ noweber ] , which shows the @xmath0-symbol and the ponzano - regge approximation as a function of @xmath4 for certain values of the other five @xmath3 s ( notation is explained by ( [ normal6j ] ) below ) . the sticks in the diagram give the exact values of the @xmath0-symbol , while the curve is the ponzano - regge approximation .",
    "although the @xmath0-symbol is only defined for discrete values of @xmath4 , the ponzano - regge approximation is defined for continuous values of the parameters , and allows us to talk of the phase of the @xmath0-symbol in an unambiguous manner .",
    "the ponzano - regge approximation shows the expected divergences at the caustics or turning points , and the airy function behavior at the right turning point . in the classically allowed region between the turning points",
    "the wave length decreases as we move to the left , corresponding to an increase in the variable conjugate to @xmath4 ( the angle @xmath5 , defined in sec .",
    "[ phasespace6j]below ) . at the left turning point",
    "the airy function is not so obvious , because it is multiplied by a rapidly oscillating cosine term .",
    "this is because the angle @xmath5 conjugate to @xmath4 reaches the value @xmath6 at the right turning point .",
    "the behavior illustrated in fig .",
    "[ noweber ] can not be matched by a weber function ( harmonic oscillator eigenfunction ) , for which both turning points have the behavior of an unmodulated airy function .",
    "related to this is the fact that the difference between the ponzano - regge phases at the two turning points is not of the form @xmath7 for the parameters shown in fig .  [ noweber ] . for harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions",
    "the difference in the action between the two turning points is always of the form @xmath7 , a condition that is equivalent to the single - valuedness of the wkb wave function ( that is , it is the bohr - sommerfeld quantization condition ) .",
    "one can say that the @xmath0-symbol has a nonstandard matching condition of the two wkb branches at the lower turning point for the parameters in fig .",
    "[ noweber ] .",
    "ultimately there are topological reasons for the failure of the weber function as a standard form for a uniform approximation in cases such as that illustrated in fig .",
    "[ noweber ] .",
    "uniform approximations are based on a smooth , area preserving map between the phase space of the given problem and the standard problem .",
    "but the phase space of the @xmath0-symbol is a sphere ( we call it the @xmath0-sphere ) , and the phase space of the harmonic oscillator is a plane .",
    "these two spaces can not be continuously mapped into one another .",
    "we have noticed , however , that the phase space that arises in the semiclassical analysis of the wigner @xmath1-matrices ( rotation matrices ) is also a sphere .",
    "we call this the @xmath1-sphere , to distinguish it from the @xmath0-sphere .",
    "moreover , the classical orbits on the two spheres are topological circles in both cases , and in both cases intersecting orbits always intersect in two points , unless they are tangent , in which case there is one intersection point .",
    "there are also cases in which the orbits do not intersect at all , corresponding to classically forbidden regions .",
    "as is well known , the classical orbits and their intersections provide the geometrical framework for the construction of semiclassical ( asymptotic ) approximations .",
    "these topological features are the same for both the @xmath0-sphere and the @xmath1-sphere , suggesting that one can be mapped into the other by a smooth transformation that takes a pair of orbits on one sphere into the pair of orbits on the other .",
    "we have worked out the details of this mapping and the corresponding uniform approximation .",
    "the resulting approximation is smooth and uniform over the entire range of quantum numbers @xmath4 and @xmath8 ( for fixed @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) . for most values of the @xmath3 s it is more accurate than the ponzano - regge approximation , certainly near the caustics but also at most other places .",
    "we have found no places where it is dramatically worse than the ponzano - regge approximation .    in this paper",
    "we shall present the new uniform approximation itself , as well as some of the geometric rationale behind it , which helps considerably in understanding the formula and the various regions that it covers .",
    "in addition , we shall present some numerical tests of the new formula and comparisons with the exact @xmath0-symbol and the ponzano - regge approximation .",
    "we shall not , however , present the details of the derivation .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ background6j ] we present a collection of facts about the @xmath0-symbol and its asymptotic or semiclassical approximation ( the ponzano - regge formula ) , emphasizing the spherical phase space and its geometrical ramifications . in sec .",
    "[ dmatrices ] we present a geometrical treatment of the asymptotic properties of the rotation matrices ( @xmath1-matrices ) that emphasizes the similarities with the @xmath0-symbol . in sec .",
    "[ unifappx ] we outline the ideas behind the uniform approximation of the @xmath0-symbol in terms of @xmath1-matrices , we present the actual formulas , and we present some numerical tests .",
    "finally , in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] we make some conclusions .",
    "we set @xmath13 , so all angular momenta are dimensionless .",
    "we label the @xmath3 s in the @xmath0 symbol by @xmath14 which is how it would used when recoupling three angular momenta .",
    "the quantum number @xmath15 , @xmath16 , just gives the magnitude of the angular momentum , and does not specify the sign of the operator .",
    "for example , instead of coupling three angular momenta to obtain a fourth , that is , setting @xmath17 , we can couple four angular momenta with a sum of zero , @xmath18 ( effectively changing the sign of @xmath19 ) .",
    "this is how we shall regard the recoupling problem in this paper .",
    "usually we will think of @xmath15 , @xmath20 as given , while @xmath4 and @xmath8 are variable intermediate angular momenta that result from the coupling of the first four .",
    "they are the quantum numbers of the squares of the operators @xmath21    with this interpretation , the @xmath0-symbol in the form ( [ normal6j ] ) is proportional to the unitary matrix element @xmath22 that takes one from the eigenbasis of one intermediate angular momentum ( @xmath4 ) to the eigenbasis of the other ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "these bases span the subspace of the product space of four angular momenta in which ( [ jsumvanishes ] ) holds as an operator equation .",
    "we shall denote this subspace by @xmath23 . according to ( [ jsumvanishes ] ) , the total angular momentum vanishes on @xmath23 .",
    "the orthonormality relations satisfied by the @xmath0-symbol ( see , for example , edmonds@xcite eq .",
    "( 6.2.9 ) ) are essentially a statement of the unitarity of the matrix @xmath24 .    to be defined the @xmath0-symbol ( [ normal6j ] ) must satisfy four triangle inequalities , in @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , for example , @xmath4 must lie between the bounds @xmath29 in integer steps . for given @xmath15 , @xmath20 , these imply that @xmath4 and @xmath8 vary between the limits @xmath30 in integer steps , where @xmath31 the number of allowed @xmath4 or @xmath8 values is the same , and it is the dimension @xmath32 of the subspace @xmath23 as well as the size of the matrix @xmath33 , @xmath34      the basic reference on the semiclassical mechanics of the @xmath0-symbol is ponzano and regge@xcite .",
    "we add to their discussion an appreciation of the gram matrix ( see appendix  [ constucttetrahedron ] ) and the recent realization that the phase space of the @xmath0-symbol is a sphere @xcite .",
    "we shall reserve lower case @xmath15 for quantum numbers as in ( [ normal6j ] ) , and for semiclassical purposes we shall set @xmath35 ( with capital @xmath36 s ) , for @xmath16 .",
    "the quantity @xmath37 is interpreted as the length of the classical angular momentum vector associated with the quantum number @xmath15 .",
    "the correction @xmath38 is a maslov index , and the manner in which it arises in the semiclassical theory of angular momentum is explained in aquilanti et al@xcite .",
    "we shall write @xmath39 ( in bold face ) either for the vector of angular momentum operators in quantum mechanics , or for the classical angular momentum vector in a classical model .",
    "the distinction will be established by context .",
    "for example , in the classical context , ( [ jsumvanishes ] ) is interpreted as a constraint on the four classical vectors @xmath39 , @xmath20 , while ( [ j12j23defs ] ) is interpreted as the definitions of two more classical angular momenta @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the condition ( [ jidef ] ) is a quantization condition of the bohr - sommerfeld type , restricting the the classical quantity @xmath37 to discrete values .",
    "some authors have viewed ( [ jidef ] ) as an approximation to @xmath42^{1/2}$ ] , valid when @xmath3 is large , but in fact it is represents the exact eigenvalues of a certain operator for all values of @xmath3 , even @xmath43 . when properly understood@xcite , ( [ jidef ] ) is equivalent to the fact that the eigenvalues of the operator @xmath44 are @xmath45 .",
    "in purely classical mechanics , however , there is no quantization , and all variables take on continuous values .",
    "we must allow this in order to view the classical phase space . to visualize the phase space of the @xmath0-symbol",

    "then @xmath46 and @xmath47 are restricted by classical versions of the triangle inequalities , @xmath48 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 vary continuously between the bounds indicated , and where the bounds themselves are given by @xmath49 these are the bounds of @xmath46 and @xmath47 on the @xmath0-sphere .    here",
    "are two useful theorems .",
    "first , if @xmath50 or @xmath51 , then @xmath52 , otherwise @xmath53 .",
    "second , if @xmath54 or @xmath55 , then @xmath56 , otherwise @xmath57 .",
    "if the quantization conditions ( [ jidef ] ) hold for @xmath37 , @xmath20 , then the bounds on the continuous variables @xmath46 and @xmath47 can be expressed in terms of the bounds on the quantum number @xmath4 and @xmath8 by @xmath58 combined with ( [ dimzdef ] ) , these imply @xmath59    if @xmath60 , @xmath20 and if @xmath46 and @xmath47 satisfy the triangle inequalities ( [ j12j23inequals ] ) , then it is possible to find six classical vectors @xmath39 , @xmath16 that can be placed end - to - end in subsets of three to create four triangles .",
    "the triangles are defined by ( [ j12j23defs ] ) , plus @xmath61 and @xmath62 . in particular , this can always be done when the six @xmath37 satisfy the quantization conditions ( [ jidef ] ) for values of @xmath15 that are valid in a @xmath0-symbol , in which case @xmath60 for all six @xmath63 ( because @xmath64 ) and the areas of the triangles are positive ( because the @xmath15 satisfy the triangle inequalities ) .",

    "it is invariant under the three operations in which the upper and lower elements of two columns are swapped , but not under the six permutations of the columns .",
    "( we have not tested the `` extra '' symmetries due to regge@xcite . ) therefore when @xmath207 , we can permute columns in an unfavorable case such as ( [ worstcase ] ) to obtain a better approximation .",
    "we have tested an algorithm in which , before applying the uniform approximation , the columns of the @xmath0-symbol are permuted to place the column with the largest minimum value in the third column .",

    "we have written computer codes that implement the uniform approximations given in this paper , which document the algorithms and check all their details .",
    "we will make these programs available to any interested parties .",
    "we will publish the derivation of the uniform approximation presented in this paper in a future article , in which we will make explicit the symplectic map between the @xmath0-sphere and the @xmath1-sphere that underlies it , as well as outline how the theory of quantum normal forms leads to a uniform approximation in cases like this .",
    "it is a pleasure to offer this manuscript as a present to enzo aquilanti on the occasion of his seventieth birthday , and to thank him for suggesting the problem of uniform approximations to the @xmath0-symbol .",
    "we would also like to thank him for years of friendship and intellectual stimulation , which we hope and trust is only a beginning .",
    "the @xmath0-symbol specifies the lengths @xmath37 of the classical angular momentum vectors @xmath39 but not their directions , so there is the question of how the actual vectors can be constructed in three dimensional space , satisfying the identities ( [ jsumvanishes ] ) and ( [ j12j23defs ] ) .    initially we assume that real vectors @xmath39 exist , and we define @xmath209 which are the three vectors running along the edges emanating from the upper vertex in fig .",

    "this does not determine @xmath217 , but that matrix amounts to an overall rotation of the tetrahedron which is arbitrary anyway .",

    "we can find the @xmath222 s by inverting ( [ adefs ] ) and using ( [ j12j23defs ] ) .",
    "thus a real tetrahedron can be constructed if and only if the eigenvalues of @xmath67 are nonnegative .",
    "the tetrahedron is only determined modulo overall rotations , proper and improper . if we wish the tetrahedron to have a definite handedness , we can perform a spatial inversion , if necessary , to make the volume in ( [ vdef ] ) positive .",
    "the spatial inversion is properly brought about by time reversal , not parity , which does not change the sign of angular momenta . with this understanding ,",
    "the final tetrahedron is determined modulo proper rotations .",
    "if any of the eigenvalues of @xmath67 are negative , then a real tetrahedron does not exist .",
    "it turns out that at most one eigenvalue of @xmath67 defined by ( [ gijcalc ] ) can be negative , assuming the triangle inequalities on the @xmath37 . a proof of this fact is easily given by considering the secular polynomial of @xmath67 , whose coefficients can be expressed in terms of the lengths of the @xmath222 s and the areas of the triangles formed by them .",
    "if @xmath67 has one negative eigenvalue , then we can order the singular values so that the imaginary one is the third one .",
