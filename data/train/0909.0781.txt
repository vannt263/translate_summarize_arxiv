    "it has long been known that cluster galaxies appear to be different from field galaxies in their morphological type and color ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . in the local universe @xmath20 of the population in the core regions of rich clusters consists of ellipticals and s0 s while spirals dominate in the field @xcite .",
    "this could either mean that galaxies form differently in dense environment or that galaxies are affected by their surroundings .",
    "many mechanisms could drive environmental evolution , for example ram - pressure stripping @xcite , turbulent / viscous stripping @xcite , thermal evaporation @xcite , starvation @xcite , interaction with the cluster potential @xcite , harassment , the cumulative effect of many fast interactions @xcite , slow interactions between individual galaxies @xcite and mergers .",
    "single dish 21  cm observations , such as @xcite , chamaraux , balkowski & gerard ( 1980 ) and @xcite have found that spirals near the cluster core regions are very deficient in their neutral atomic hydrogen gas , hi , compared to galaxies of the same morphological type and size in the field .",
    "@xcite first showed that not only the gas content but also the size of the gas disks is affected .",
    "subsequent hi imaging studies of nearby clusters like virgo and coma @xcite , showed that the hi disks of the highly hi deficient galaxies are severely truncated to within the stellar disk .",
    "these images of unperturbed stellar disks with highly truncated gas disks strongly suggest that galaxies lose their interstellar gas ( ism ) through an interaction with the hot intracluster medium ( icm )",
    ".    however , there are still remaining questions .",
    "first , @xcite already pointed out that ram pressure stripping by the hot icm alone can not be responsible for the transformation of spirals into s0 s .",
    "the morphology density relation changes very smoothly and a significant fraction of s0 s reside in low density environment , and the bulge to disk ratios of s0 s are systematically larger in all density regimes .",
    "this can not be caused by a simple ism stripping .",
    "more recently , in a study of 18 nearby clusters , @xcite show that the hi deficiency decreases gradually with increasing projected distance from the cluster center out to @xmath212 abell radii ( @xmath22  mpc ) . a similar trend is found in star formation rate which begins to decrease at a clustercentric radius of 3 - 4 virial radii or 1.5 abell radii ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these results suggest that galaxies are already modified in much lower density environments , where ram pressure is expected to be unimportant , and now the question has become : how exactly are galaxies affected in different density regions ?",
    "that is , how far out do galaxies feel the impact of the cluster , which mechanisms are at work in lower density environments , and what are the dominant environmental effects onto disks that galaxies experience as they come close to the cluster center ?    in order to answer these questions ,",
    "we have probed the cluster environment using high resolution hi data on a sample of carefully selected virgo galaxies .",
    "the hi gas is often a good tracer of different physical processes as it gets affected both by the intracluster medium ( icm ) and gravitational interactions . also , the outer gas disk is mostly in atomic form , where it is more vulnerable to the surroundings .",
    "in addition , it provides useful diagnostics for galaxy evolution as it is the fuel for star formation .",
    "the hi data were taken using the very large array ( vla ) .",
    "the vla has had significant improvements since the previous virgo survey .",
    "the l band ( 20  cm ) receivers have been replaced and the c array has been replaced by the c short ( cs ) configuration .",
    "our high resolution , high sensitivity vla hi data allow us to investigate not only the evolutionary history of individual galaxies but also the overall impact of virgo on its members .",
    "several results of the survey and a preceding pilot for the survey have already been published .",
    "kenney , van gorkom & vollmer ( 2004 ) , and @xcite present an analysis of the data on ngc  4522 , a galaxy far away from m87 , yet stripped to well within the optical disk and showing abundant evidence for currently ongoing stripping .",
    "they suggest that ngc  4522 possibly shows evidence for enhanced ram pressure due to bulk motions or substructure of the icm .",
    "@xcite present hi , radio continuum and high quality optical images of the edge - on galaxy ngc  4402 , which shows evidence for dense cloud ablation .",
    "one of the striking results of the survey is a number of one sided long hi tails pointing away from the cluster center and at intermediate distances from m87 .",
    "@xcite argue that these are probably galaxies recently arrived near the cluster and falling into the cluster for the first time .",
    "some of our data have already been used to constrain simulations of individual systems , for example on ngc 4522 @xcite and ngc 4501 @xcite .    in this work , we present the complete hi atlas and describe the hi properties of individual galaxies in detail . in a second paper",

    ". however the new seven element arecibo l - band feed array ( alfa ) receiver system makes a complete image of the area and we consider the alfalfa fluxes the best measure of the total amount of hi . meanwhile interferometers can not measure structures on angular scales larger than the fringe spacing formed by the shortest spacing @xcite . as a result they can miss some flux in extended features .",
    "the vla cs array has the same shortest spacing as the vla d array , and it should in principle be able to measure extended features equally well ( the maximum extended structure that can be imaged is 15  arcmin at 20  cm ) .",
    "however since it has fewer short spacings than d array it still somewhat less sensitive to faint extended structure . with the vla c array , the maximum",
    "extent visible is 6  arcmin and we could possibly have missed some flux from very extended structures in the galaxies observed with the c configuration .",
    "our conclusion is that in general there is very good agreement with the alfalfa fluxes .",

    "there is good agreement between the interferometer and the single dish values . since there is a distinct possibility that the interferometer resolves out some of the most extended flux , we show in the lower plot the difference between the single dish values and the viva flux as function of hi extent .",
    "as expected the scatter in the total flux goes up in absolute value for large sources , but the fractional error goes down .",
    "there is no evidence that viva fluxes are less than alfalfa fluxes for the large diameter sources .",
    "rather , there is a marginally significant suggestion that viva fluxes are on average greater than alfalfa fluxes for the largest sources . to estimate how significant the uncertainties in the flux values are we show in figure  [ fig - compub2 ] ( upper plot ) the same differences , but normalized by the viva fluxes .",

    "we find that there is excellent agreement between the viva and alfalfa fluxes and there is no indication that the interferometer has missed any very extended flux .",
    "in this section we describe the range of hi morphologies found in the different locations in virgo .",
    "we present results for individual galaxies in an appendix . in figure  [ fig - poster ]",
    "we show a composite image of the total hi images of the individual galaxies ( in blue ) overlaid on the rosat x - ray image ( orange ) by @xcite .",
    "the galaxies are located at the proper position in the cluster but each hi image is magnified by a factor 10 to show the details of the hi distribution .",
    "the picture shows how non - uniform the mass distribution in virgo is , with enhanced x - ray emission from the cluster and subclusters centered at the giant ellipticals , m87 , m86 and m49 respectively .",
    "there is a huge range in hi size of the galaxies . in general the galaxies at larger projected distances",
    "have larger hi sizes , while galaxies in the core have small hi sizes , but there are exceptions . in figure  [ fig - examples ] we show typical examples for the range of morphologies that we see .    *",
    "hi rich galaxies in the outskirts of the cluster * hi rich galaxies are exclusively found in the lower density regions of the cluster outskirts at the projected distance from m87 @xmath73mpc .",
    "these galaxies usually have hi extending well beyond the stellar disk in all directions .",
    "small , kinematically distinct hi features with or without optical counterparts are quite common around these systems .",
    "a typical example is ngc  4808 shown in figure  [ fig - examples ] .",
    "many of the galaxies in the outskirts look morphologically peculiar showing tails or rings in hi , in the stellar distribution or both . some show a kinematical decoupling between inner and outer gaseous disks .",
    "these galaxies seem to be experiencing gravitational interactions and possibly continuing infall of gas from the halo .",
    "for example ngc  4651 ( figure  [ fig - examples ] ) shows in hi an extension to the west , while deep optical images show a stellar tail to the opposite side of the hi , which ends with a low surface brightness arc .",
    "kinematically the hi disk shows a discontinuity in position angle between inner and outer disk .",
    "* long one - sided hi tails pointing away from m87 * at intermediate distances from m87 ( @xmath74mpc ) , we find seven galaxies with long one - sided hi tails pointing away from m87 .",
    "an example is ngc  4302 ( figure  [ fig - examples ] ) .",
    "the hi is mildly truncated within the stellar disk in the south , and the gas tail is extended to the north , with no optical counterpart .",
    "although there is a nearby companion , ngc  4298 , ngc  4302 looks optically undisturbed . in @xcite",
    "we argue that these galaxies have only recently arrived in the cluster and are falling in to the center , likely on highly radial orbits as hinted by the direction of the tails .",
    "a simple estimate suggests that all but two of the tails could have been formed by ram pressure stripping of the gas in the very outer parts of the disk .",
    "some of these galaxies have close neighbours , suggesting that tidal interactions may have moved gas outward , making it more susceptible to ram pressure stripping .",
    "apparently galaxies begin to lose their gas already at intermediate distances from the cluster center through ram pressure stripping and tidal interactions or a combination of both .",
    "* symmetric hi disks with @xmath75 at intermediate distances * at similar distances from m87 as the h i tails we find galaxies with fairly symmetric hi disks that are comparable in size to their stellar disk , e.g. ngc  4216 shown in figure  [ fig - examples ] .",
    "some are quite hi deficient , despite the fact that the hi extent is comparable to the optical extent .",
    "their hi surface density is down by up to a factor two .",
    "these systems might be under the influence of a process that slowly affects the entire face of the galaxy , such as turbulent viscous stripping or thermal evaporation @xcite .",
    "* small hi disks near the cluster center * near the cluster core ( @xmath76mpc ) galaxies always have gas disks that are truncated to within the optical disk .",
    "these galaxies often show highly asymmetric hi distributions as they are currently undergoing strong ram pressure stripping .",
    "an example is ngc  4402 ( figure  [ fig - examples ] ) , which has been studied in detail by @xcite .",
    "galaxies appear to lose most of their hi gas ( @xmath77 ) in these regions through a strong interaction with the icm .    * severely stripped hi disks beyond the cluster core * interestingly",
    ", we also find a number of galaxies that are stripped to well within the stellar disk at large projected distances from the cluster center ( @xmath78mpc ) .",
    "examples are ngc  4522 , ngc  4405 , and ngc  4064 ( figure  [ fig - examples ] ) .",
    "some of these may have been stripped while crossing the cluster center .",
    "as the galaxies move out from the high icm density region stripped and disturbed gas that is still bound to the galaxy may resettle onto the disk and form a small symmetric gas disk in the center ( ngc  4405 ) .",
    "however , a detailed study of the mean stellar age at the truncation radius by @xcite shows that some of these galaxies have been forming stars until recently ( @xmath79gyr ) .",
    "this leaves not enough time for these galaxies to have been stripped in the center and then travelled to their current location .",
    "ngc  4064 is a good example of this .",
    "it must have lost its gas at large distances from the cluster center .",
    "a particularly interesting case is ngc  4522 @xcite , which shows abundant evidence for current ongoing strong ram pressure stripping despite its large projected distance from m87 ( @xmath80  mpc ) .",
    "an estimate of the mean stellar age at the stripping radius @xcite also suggests that stripping is ongoing , yet an estimate of the ram pressure at that location based on a smooth distribution of the icm would indicate that pressure is too low by a factor 10 .",
    "@xcite argue that merging of the sub cluster m49 with virgo could locally enhance the ram pressure , due to bulk motions , clumpy density distributions and variations in the temperature of the icm gas .",
    "a temperature map of the x - ray emission @xcite does show that ngc  4522 is located near strong variations in the x - ray temperature .",
    "the results on galaxies such as ngc  4064 and ngc  4522 fit in nicely with recent work by tonnesen , bryan & van gorkom ( 2007 ) and @xcite , who find that ram pressure can vary by more than a factor 10 at a given distance from the cluster center due to structure in the icm .",
    "this makes it possible for some galaxies to get stripped in the outskirts , without ever making it to the center of the cluster , something we may be witnessing in virgo .",
    "we present the results of a new hi imaging survey of 53 galaxies in the virgo cluster .",
    "the goal is to study the impact of different environmental effects on the hi disks of the galaxies .",
    "virgo is ideal for this type of study as it is dynamically young and potentially contains galaxies that are affected by a wide range of environmental effects .",
    "its nearness allows us to study individual galaxies in great detail .",
    "we have selected 48 galaxies and obtained data on 5 additional galaxies that were in the same field and velocity range as the target galaxies .",
    "the galaxies were selected to cover a wide range of star formation properties from anemic to starburst , and to be located in a wide range of local galaxy densities , from the dense core to the outskirts of the cluster .",
    "the target galaxies are at projected distances from 0.3 to 3.3 mpc from the cluster center and as such the survey covers a region that is 2 to 3 times larger than the area explored in the previous vla survey by @xcite .",
    "many of our galaxies had never been imaged in hi .",
    "the new survey was done with the vla cs configuration .",
    "its spatial and spectral resolution are a factor 3 and 4 better than that of the previous survey .",
    "the viva survey has not only confirmed results from previous hi imaging studies , it has found many features that were never seen before in virgo , or any other cluster . to summarize our main results :    1 .",
    "we confirm that galaxies near the cluster center have hi disks that are much smaller than the optical disk .",
    "we see however extraplanar gas near some of the galaxies , providing the first direct evidence for ongoing ram pressure stripping and fall back of stripped gas .",
    "2 .   at intermediate distances from the center ( 0.6 - 1 mpc ) we find galaxies with long one - sided hi tails pointing away from m87 .",
    "@xcite argue that these are most likely galaxies falling into the cluster on highly radial orbits .",
    "the tails are due to ram pressure stripping and in a few cases to the combined effect of gravitational interactions and rampressure stripping .",
    "thus the impact of ram pressure begins to affect galaxies already at intermediate distances from the center .",
    "we found several galaxies in the outskirts of virgo ( @xmath811.5 mpc ) that have also hi disks that are much smaller than the stellar disks .",
    "some of these were already known to be strongly hi deficient @xcite .",
    "although these galaxies are as hi deficient as the galaxies in the core , none of them shows signs of ongoing / recent stripping . some of these galaxies may have been stripped earlier when passing through the center of virgo , but at least some of them have been forming stars in the stripped part of the disks until quite recently @xcite .",
    "the latter galaxies almost certainly have been stripped of their gas in the outskirts of the cluster .",
    "4 .   in the outskirts",
    "we find several extended hi bridges and optical disturbances , which indicate that the systems are gravitationally interacting .    in paper  ii",

    "<S> the hi observations were done in cs configuration of the very large array radio telescope , with a typical spatial resolution of @xmath4 and a column density sensitivity of @xmath5  @xmath6 in @xmath7 per 10 km s@xmath8 channel . </S>",
    "<S> the survey was supplemented with data of comparable quality from the nrao archive , taken in cs or c configuration . in this paper ( viva  </S>",
    "<S> i : the atlas and the hi properties ) , we present hi channel maps , total intensity maps , velocity fields , velocity dispersions , global / radial profiles , position - velocity diagrams and overlays of hi/1.4  ghz continuum maps on the optical images . we also present the hi properties such as total flux ( @xmath9 ) , hi mass ( @xmath10 ) , linewidths ( @xmath11  &  @xmath12 ) , velocity ( @xmath13 ) , deficiency ( @xmath14 ) , size ( @xmath15  &  @xmath16 ) , and describe the hi morphology and kinematics of individual galaxies in detail . </S>",
    "<S> the survey has revealed details of hi features that were never seen before . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we briefly discuss differences in typical hi morphology for galaxies in regions of different galaxy densities . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm that galaxies near the cluster core ( @xmath17mpc ) have small hi disks compared to their stellar disks ( @xmath18 ) . </S>",
    "<S> most of these galaxies in the core also show gas displaced from the disk , which is either currently being stripped , or falling back after a stripping event . at intermediate distances ( @xmath191  mpc ) from the center we find a remarkable number of galaxies with long one sided hi tails pointing away from m87 . in a previous letter </S>",
    "<S> we argue that these are galaxies recent arrivals , falling in for the first time into the virgo core . in the outskirts </S>",
    "<S> we find many gas - rich galaxies , with gas disks extending far beyond the optical . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly we also find some galaxies with hi disks that are small compared to their stellar disk at large clustercentric distances .    </S>"
