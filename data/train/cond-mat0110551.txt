    "nature of the mechanism generating order out of randomness constitutes one of the most fundamental issues of the contemporary physics .",
    "theories based on various versions of ensembles of the random matrices provide one possible theoretical frame for studying such effects .",
    "the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) constitutes the most common reference .",
    "the related concepts originate  @xcite from nuclear physics and prove very useful in the area of strongly interacting fermi systems or in quantum chaos  @xcite . at present",
    "they finds even broader applications in such diverse fields like the brain research  @xcite , econophysics  @xcite and most recently in the `` real - world '' networks or graphs  @xcite .",
    "utility of the standard random matrix theory ( rmt ) results form the fact that a potential agreement reflects the generic properties of a system and thus in many cases it provides an appropriate null hypothesis . from this perspective",
    "the deviations are even more interesting as they can be used to quantify some properties which are nonrandom and thus system specific .    in this context",
    "the recently identified  @xcite preponderance of the @xmath1 ground states in strongly interacting fermi systems , such as atomic nuclei , arising from random two - body interactions seems to indicate the effect reflecting a sparser connectivity than just pure random .",
    "several closely related issues have also been addressed in the context of mesoscopic  @xcite and randomly interacting many - spin systems  @xcite .",
    "one purpose of the present investigation is to identify the origin of the related physically relevant deviations from standard rmt and to quantify their character . since it was nuclear physics which gave birth to rmt",
    "we believe that the present example , even though addressed in the nuclear context , may also stimulate much broader activity and understanding of similar effects in other areas .",
    "our theoretical framework is thus analogous to this of ref .  @xcite .",
    "then schematically , indicating nevertheless all the relevant ingredients , the interaction matrix elements @xmath2 of good total angular momentum @xmath0 in the shell - model basis @xmath3 can be expressed as follows  @xcite : @xmath4 the summation runs over all combinations of the two - particle states @xmath5 coupled to the angular momentum @xmath6 and connected by the two - body interaction @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 denote the radial parts of the corresponding two - body matrix elements while @xmath9 globally represent elements of the angular momentum recoupling geometry .",
    "structures analogous to eq .",
    "( [ eqv ] ) can be identified in various other areas .",
    "the quantum open systems  @xcite or the neural nets  @xcite provide immediate examples .    in statistical ensembles of matrices",
    "the crucial factor determining the structure of eigenspectrum is the probability distribution @xmath10 of matrix elements  @xcite . especially relevant",
    "are the tails of such distributions since they prescribe the probability of appearance of the large matrix elements . from the point of view of the mechanism producing the energy gaps they are most effective in generating a local reduction of dimensionality responsible for such effects . in principle , the probability distribution of the shell model matrix elements is prescribed by their general structure expressed by the eq .",
    "( [ eqv ] ) , provided the probability distributions of both @xmath8 and @xmath9 are known . in general terms",
    "this structure can be considered to be of the form @xmath11 and each @xmath12 to be a product of another two variables denoted as @xmath13 and @xmath14 . by making use of the convolution theorem  @xcite the probability distribution @xmath10",
    "that @xmath15 assumes a value equal to @xmath16 can be expressed as : @xmath17 ,     \\label{eqpv}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 denotes a fourier transform , @xmath19 its inverse and @xmath20 the probability distributions of individual terms .",
    "taking in addition into account the fact that @xmath21 one can explicitely derive the form of @xmath22 in several cases .",
    "assuming for instance that all the above constituents are identically gaussian distributed ( then , according to eq .",
    "( [ eqpvi ] ) , @xmath23 and thus @xmath24 ) one arrives at @xmath25 where @xmath26 stands for the modified bessel function .",
    "asymptotically , for large @xmath16 , this leads to @xmath27    for such a global estimate the identical gaussian distribution of @xmath8 is consistent both with the two - body random ensemble ( tbre )  @xcite and with the random quasiparticle ensemble ( rqe )  @xcite .",
    "the only anticipated difference originates from the fact that in the second case the variance of the distribution drops down with @xmath6 like the inverse of @xmath28 which is expected to result in a smaller effective @xmath29 as compared to tbre .",
    "by contrast , in both versions of the above random ensembles the geometry expressed by @xmath9 enters explicitely . however , the complicated quasi - random coupling of individual spins is believed  @xcite to result in the so - called geometric chaoticity  @xcite . for the extreme values of @xmath0",
    "the underlying selection rules may however impose severe constraints in achieving such a limit .",
    "below we therefore explicitly verify its range of applicability .",
    "the model to be quantitatively explored here consists , similarly as in ref .",
    "@xcite , of 6 identical particles ( all single - particle energies are set to zero ) operating in the @xmath30 shell .",
    "1 shows distributions of the corresponding geometrical factors @xmath9 for @xmath31 and for several relevant values of @xmath0 and @xmath6 .",
    "as one can see , the gaussian may be considered quite a reasonable representation of the distribution of such factors for all combinations of @xmath0 and @xmath6 shown , with one exception , for those which involve @xmath1 . in this later case",
    "the distribution of @xmath32 resembles more a uniform distribution over a finite interval located symmetrically with respect to zero .",
    "one principal reason for this fact is that the @xmath33 symbols which enter @xmath9 are here more selective .",
    "these empirical facts justify well the estimates of @xmath10 based on eq .",
    "( [ eqpr ] ) for @xmath34 and not so well for @xmath1 .",
    "more appropriate in this particular case is to assume a uniform distribution of @xmath32 over an interval confined by say @xmath35 and @xmath36 , i.e. , @xmath37 , retaining @xmath38 in its original gaussian form of course . by making use of eqs .",
    "( [ eqpv ] ) and ( [ eqpvi ] ) one then obtains @xmath39^n \\cos ( \\omega v ) d\\omega \\label{eqpvu}\\ ] ] which for large @xmath16 behaves like @xmath40    an explicit calculation of the distribution of the shell model off - diagonal matrix elements for the various @xmath0-values based on the present model with two - body matrix elements drawn from rqe ( tbre results in similar relations among different @xmath0-sectors though the distributions are somewhat broader as compared to rqe ) confirms the above analytical estimates as is illustrated in fig .  2 .",
    "indeed , such a distribution in the @xmath1 sector resembles more a gaussian and the large @xmath16 tails of this distribution drop down faster as compared to the @xmath34-sectors where this asymptotics is exponential ( eq .  ( [ eqpa ] ) ) . at the same time",
    "the @xmath34 sectors are dominated by very small matrix elements to a larger degree than @xmath1 .",
    "the probability of appearance of a large off - diagonal matrix element which in magnitude overwhelms the remaining ones is thus greater for @xmath34 than for @xmath1 .",
    "such an effective reduction of the rank in the former case is expected to result in a stronger tendency to localization as compared to goe  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding characteristics can be quantified in terms of the information entropy @xmath41 of an eigenstate labelled by @xmath42 from the @xmath0-sector .",
    "the coefficients @xmath43 denote the eigenvector components in the basis @xmath44 . such a mean field basis offers an appropriate reference  @xcite for the present purpose . since the definition of @xmath45 involves the total number of states @xmath46 which differ for different @xmath0 s , before relating the result to the goe we normalise @xmath45 to the goe limit of this quantity  @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the digamma function . within our model",
    "the so - calculated and rqe ensemble averaged quantity for all the states versus their corresponding energies @xmath49 is illustrated in fig .",
    "as anticipated , it is not @xmath1 whose lowest eigenstate comes out most localised , i.e. , most regular .",
    "the lowest states for several higher @xmath0 values ( like 2 and especially 4 ) deviate much more from goe .",
    "this thus indicates more favorable conditions for the emergence of energy gaps for larger @xmath0 than for @xmath1 .",
    "3 provides one more information which turns out helpful to properly interpret the results .",
    "the @xmath1 states are spread over the broadest energy interval even though the number of states @xmath50 is here significantly smaller than for several larger @xmath0 values @xmath51 . as a result ,",
    "the average level spacing is a factor of few larger for @xmath1 than for the remaining ones .    in fig .",
    "4 ( dashed line ) we therefore show distributions of the ground state @xmath52 gaps @xmath53 where similarly as in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath54 though here for each @xmath0 individually .",
    "as it is clearly seen the @xmath1-sector does not significantly distinguish from the remaining ones .",
    "in view of our investigations presented above one would however expect a reduced probability for occurance of the large ground state energy gaps in this particular sector . as the solid lines in fig .",
    "4 indicate such an effect does indeed take place when @xmath55 in eq .",
    "( [ eqrho ] ) is replaced by @xmath56 in fact , it seems more appropriate and more consistent with the above global considerations to relate the ground state energy gap just to the average global level spacing among the remaining states , characteristic for a given @xmath0 , as expressed by eq .",
    "( [ eqdbar ] ) .",
    "finally one may ask a question why this tendency does not extend to the highest @xmath0-values . in this connection one has to remember that the off - diagonal matrix elements is not the only relevant element .",
    "these are the diagonal matrix elements which constitute the driving term .",
    "irrespective of the value of @xmath0 their distribution is always gaussian - like .",
    "this can be observed numerically and is consistent with arguments formulated in terms of eqs .",
    "( [ eqv ] - [ eqpa ] ) since the geometrical factors @xmath9 entering the diagonal matrix elements are always nonnegative . as it is shown in fig .  5 ( dashed lines ) ,",
    "increasing however @xmath0 beyond 4 results in a significant reduction of the variance of @xmath10 for the diagonal matrix elements and consequently a larger fraction of the off - diagonal matrix elements becomes effective in mixing the basis states .",
    "in addition , due to a smaller number of terms entering the eq .",
    "( [ eqv ] ) , for the stretched high-@xmath0 states the effect of geometric chaoticity is no longer effective and in this respect the conditions become similar to those for @xmath1 . as a result",
    ", the distribution of off - diagonal matrix elements converts back towards more gaussian - like shaped , i.e. @xmath57 becomes larger ( for @xmath58 not shown in fig .",
    "2 @xmath59 ) . superposing the above two effects one thus obtains even smaller gaps and even more delocalized states at the edges of the spectra as compared to @xmath1 .",
    "in fact the spectral density ( solid lines in fig .  ( 5 ) ) becomes even somewhat closer to semicircular in this case .",
    "the present investigation based both on theoretical as well as on numerical arguments clearly shows that the many - body problems described in terms of various variants of the two - body random ensembles ( like rqe or tbre ) develop quantitatively well identified deviations from the goe .",
    "these deviations can be linked to differences in the distribution of matrix elements and quantified in terms of the localisation or of energy gaps in eigenspectra .",
    "contrary to the common belief they point to the intermediate total angular momenta as those @xmath0-sectors whose ground states are ordered most . from this perspective",
    ", a predominance of the @xmath1 ground states  @xcite can be viewed as a result of mixing states with different characteristic energy scales from different @xmath0-sectors .",
    "it seems also appropriate to notice here that the arguments formulated in terms of eqs .",
    "( [ eqv]-[eqpa ] ) provide a more adequate approach towards understanding the distribution of matrix elements in realistic nuclear shell - model calculations than the ones based on multipole expansion  @xcite .",
    "finally , similar parallels between the distribution of matrix elements and the structure of eigenspectra relative to the goe can be set in the recent econophysics  @xcite applications .",
