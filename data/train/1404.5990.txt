    "it is well known that the quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic ( em ) field coupled to electric charges generate an observable interaction energy @xcite .",
    "the fluctuations which mediate the self - interaction of electrons bound to atomic nuclei give rise to the lamb shift of atomic levels ; the fluctuations which mediate the interaction between nearby molecules generate van - der - waals energies ; and finally the fluctuations between macroscopic dielectrics generate the casimir energy .",
    "direct observation of these energies is possible by spectroscopy , atomic interferometry or nanomechanical means @xcite .",
    "+ less well - known is the fact that other observable quantities , functions of the em field , can be influenced by quantum fluctuations under certain symmetry conditions .",
    "that is , when the time - space symmetries of the medium to which the fluctuations couple are compatible with the symmetries of some observable operator , the expectation value of that operator in the vacuum state of the system medium - em field may take a non - zero value .",
    "this is the case of the linear momentum of the em field when quantum fluctuations couple to a medium in which both parity ( p ) and time - reversal ( t ) symmetries are broken .",
    "in particular , the constitutive equations of a magneto - electric medium contain a non - reciprocal ( _ nr _ ) em susceptibility @xcite , @xmath0 , which results from broken p and t. generally @xmath0 is an antisymmetric t , p - odd tensor which generates an electric polarization in response to a magnetic field , @xmath1 , and conversely , a magnetization as a response to an electric field , @xmath2 . as a result of the matter - field coupling and momentum conservation",
    ", linear momentum can be transferred from the em vacuum to matter during the process that controls the break down of the symmetries .",
    "a nonzero tensor @xmath3 is found in any medium in crossed external electric and magnetic fields , in a moving dielectric medium and in a chiral medium exposed to a magnetic field @xcite . in this article",
    "we concentrate on the latter case . + it is a generic phenomenon in field theory that the breakdown of a symmetry is accompanied by a non - zero vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of some physical observable associated to the symmetry . in our case",
    "the p and t symmetries happen to be broken explicitly by the presence of a chiral molecule and the action of an external magnetic field , @xmath4 .",
    "correspondingly , a non - zero vev of the em momentum shows up in the direction along which the symmetries are broken , @xmath4 .",
    "the question arises whether it could be possible to take advantage of this phenomenon for practical purposes . to this end",
    "we will show that , due to the conservation of total linear momentum , there exists necessarily a transfer of kinetic momentum to the chiral molecule of equal magnitude and opposite sign to the vev of the em momentum .",
    "+ also , in the context of high energy physics , it is known that the electro - weak interaction violates the p and t symmetries @xcite , and cp ( i.e. , t ) is also expected to be naturally broken in qcd . in the latter case , the existence of a light pseudo - scalar particle , the axion , has been postulated as a solution of the so - called _ strong cp problem _",
    "@xcite , and indirect observations of the axion through its coupling to the em field have been suggested @xcite and put into practice @xcite . in the pvlas experiment",
    "@xcite signatures of the axion - photon interaction are investigated through the anomalous rotation of the polarization direction of optical light in the presence of an intense magnetic field , similar to the vacuum birefringence effect expected from the polarization of the qed vacuum @xcite .",
    "nonetheless the rotation of the polarization axis of light may be caused by the break down of the p or t symmetries separately , while the effect described in the present article needs the simultaneous breakdown of both symmetries and is independent of polarization .",
    "+ already in classical electrodynamics , a kinetic momentum is acquired by matter under external time - dependent electric and magnetic fields perpendicular to each other @xcite .",
    "conservation of total momentum implies that the classical em momentum and the kinetic momentum must be equal in magnitude and opposite in sign .",
    "several expressions can be found in the literature for this classical em momentum , all derived from some kind of phenomenological assumptions .",
    "this controversy is known as the abraham - minkowski problem . according to abraham s prescription , the density of em momentum is @xmath5 , while minkowski s formula reads @xmath6 .",
    "more recently , the microscopical approach of nelson @xcite , which appeals to the lorentz force over bound and free charges and currents for the coupling between matter and radiation , predicts a momentum density of an em wave in a material medium , @xmath7 .",
    "+ starting with a classical lagrangian that reproduces maxwell s equations and using the constitutive equations of a homogeneous and isotropic medium of density @xmath8 moving at velocity @xmath9 , feigel @xcite found a total conserved momentum density @xmath10 , from which the kinetic momentum density of matter is found , @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "however , following an approach close to nelson s , van tiggelen has arrived to another conservation law @xcite . on the one hand , the combination of maxwell s equations and the constitutive equations for a moving medium of mass density @xmath12 yields , @xmath13 , with @xmath14 and @xmath15 the lorentz force density , @xmath16 being the density of charge . on the other hand , newton s law reads @xmath17 .",
    "lastly , combining both equations and integrating in space one obtains the total conserved momentum @xmath18 .",
    "the equation of motion which derives from this approach is @xcite @xmath19 .",
    "+ in addition to the classical em momentum coming from external crossed fields , em quantum fluctuations can generate extra terms when the constitutive equations contain non - reciprocal susceptibilities , @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the basic argument is that a non - zero @xmath0 generates what is called spectral non - reciprocity .",
    "that is , there exists a difference in the frequency of normal modes propagating in opposite directions along the axis where the p symmetry is broken , @xmath20 .",
    "this implies that the addition of the linear momenta propagated by these modes do not cancel out .",
    "the total momentum of the normal modes is the momentum of the vacuum fluctuations and therefore it is referred to as casimir momentum .",
    "+ as pointed out in refs.@xcite feigel s approach suffers from a number of problems . in the first place ,",
    "since @xmath21 is proportional to the energy current , one expects that in thermodynamic equilibrium @xmath22 , and so no variation of the kinetic momentum can be obtained from variations of @xmath23 .",
    "second , the final result obtained by feigel for the casimir momentum density , @xmath24 , seems to lack a reference frame since this equation is not lorentz or even galilean invariant @xcite .",
    "+ in addition , the derivations of the above expressions for the conserved linear momentum are purely phenomenological and lack an explicit quantum interaction hamiltonian between matter and radiation .",
    "also , a macroscopic approach can easily lead to an erroneous prediction .",
    "for instance , it is shown in ref.@xcite that for a chiral distribution of electrically polarizable molecules in an external magnetic field , @xmath25 should hold locally , for a non - magnetic medium , and the energy flow @xmath26 vanishes . ] although the medium contains a nonzero nonreciprocal effective ( _ eff _ ) response which would make @xmath27 .",
    "another problem that should be resolved in a quantum microscopic treatment is the uv divergence of the expression for the quantum em momentum density obtained in a homogeneous medium @xcite .",
    "this line of investigation was started by kawka , van - tiggelen and rikken in refs.@xcite , where they computed the casimir momentum of an atom in crossed external electric and magnetic fields .",
    "the divergences were found there to disappear by mass renormalization and the leading quantum contribution was found to be a factor @xmath28 smaller than the classical em momentum . + in ref.@xcite we reported the quantum computation of the casimir momentum for a chiral molecule in a uniform external magnetic field . in our model chirality",
    "breaks the parity symmetry and the magnetic field breaks time reversal , so it is symmetry allowed to have a non - vanishing value for the momentum of the electromagnetic field . in this case",
    "no classical contribution to the abraham force exists since there is no external electric field . in this article",
    "we perform a semiclassical computation of the casimir momentum for the same model and compare it with the quantum result .",
    "we explain the physical mechanisms which mediate the transfer of linear momentum from the em vacuum to the chiral molecule and we analyse the transfer of energy . + the article is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we present the model .",
    "next , we perform a semiclassical computation of the casimir momentum in section [ sec3 ] . in section [ qapproach ]",
    "we review the quantum computation of ref.@xcite , paying special attention to the physical mechanisms involved in the transfer of momentum . in section [ sec5 ]",
    "we explain the exchange of energy between molecule , quantum vacuum and magnetic field . in section [ sec6 ]",
    "we summarize our conclusions .",
    "we propose the simplest model for a chiral molecule that exhibits all necessary features to leading order in perturbation theory : broken mirror symmetry , zeeman splitting of energy levels and coupling to the quantum vacuum , and we neglect relativistic effects . in our model the optical activity of the molecule is determined by a single chromophoric electron within a chiral object which is further simplified to be a two - particle system in which the chromophoric electron of charge @xmath29 and mass @xmath30 is bound to a nucleus of effective charge @xmath31 and mass @xmath32 . the binding interaction is modeled by a harmonic oscillator potential , @xmath33 , to which we add a term @xmath34 to break the mirror symmetry perturbatively in first order .",

    "we have modeled the chiral molecule using the single quantum oscillator model of condon _ et al .",

    "the transverse casimir momentum [ eq.([pperpotro ] ) ] has its origin in the spectral non - reciprocity generated by a doppler shift in the frequency of the vacuum photons .",
    "this shift is due to the internal momentum of the chromophoric electron , @xmath214 .",

    ", the finding @xmath328 proves that by modifying the symmetries of the space - time it is possible to vary the vacuum expectation value of observable quantities .",
    "+ the quantum result in eq.([main1 ] ) is linear in @xmath4 and proportional to the fine structure constant , @xmath272 , and to the molecular rotatory power .",
    "it is conjectured that this result is universal and model - independent , up to numerical prefactors of order unity which might include relativistic corrections .",
    "+ the semiclassical approach only applies to the calculation of the transverse casimir momentum and relies on the non - reciprocity of the spectrum of effective normal modes .",
    "however , it fails to incorporate the net effect of the doppler shift which comes in into the microscopical quantum approach and which is seen to dominate largely .",
