    "spin dependent semi - inclusive hadronic processes have attracted much interest from both experiment and theory sides in recent years .",
    "these processes provide us more opportunities to study the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and internal structure of the hadrons , as compared to the inclusive hadronic processes or spin averaged processes .",
    "measurements have been made in different reactions .",
    "in particular , the single transverse spin asymmetry ( ssa ) phenomena observed in various hadronic processes@xcite have stimulated remarkable theoretical developments . among the theoretical developments ,",
    "two approaches in the qcd framework have been most explored : the higher twist collinear factorization approach @xcite and the transverse momentum dependent ( tmd ) approach . in these two approaches ,",
    "the spin - dependent differential cross sections can be calculated in terms of the collinear twist three quark - gluon correlation functions in the collinear factorization formalism and the tmd distributions in the tmd factorization approach .",
    "such functions generalize the original feynman parton picture , where the partons only carry longitudinal momentum fraction of the parent hadron .",
    "they will certainly provide more information on hadron structure .",
    "further study has shown that the transverse momentum dependence of the naive - time - reversal - odd tmd distributions which are responsible for the ssas can be calculated and expressed in terms of the collinear twist - three correlation functions at the large transverse momentum . by using these results",
    ", it was shown that the above two approaches are consistent in the intermediate transverse momentum region where both apply  . in this paper",
    ", we will extend these studies to more general drell - yan processes , in particular the lepton angular distributions in polarized nucleon - nucleon scattering .",
    "the single transverse spin asymmetry in the drell - yan lepton pair production process has been used as an example to demonstrate the consistency between these two approaches  @xcite , where the single transverse spin asymmetry is represented as a correlation between the lepton pair transverse momentum @xmath0 and the transverse polarization vector @xmath1 . for this contribution ,",
    "the transverse spin dependent differential cross section is proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "the transverse momentum of the lepton pair is also the transverse momentum of the virtual photon which decays into the lepton pair in the drell - yan process .",
    "therefore , this ssa is related to the quark sivers function , and is the only contribution from the quark - antiquark channel . however ,",
    "if we further study the lepton angular distribution in the drell - yan process  @xcite , it will open more contributions to the single spin asymmetries , as well as other spin dependent observables  .",
    "more recently , by analyzing the general lorentz structure of the hadronic tensor , the complete spin and transverse momentum dependent angular distribution of lepton pair has been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , and 48 structure functions will contribute .",
    "one can calculate some of them which are leading power in the context of the tmd factorization and relate them to the tmd distributions  @xcite .    in this paper , we will study the angular distribution of the lepton pair in the polarized drell - yan process at large transverse momentum of the lepton pair .",
    "the relevant calculations are carried out in the collinear factorization framework .",
    "we mainly focus on the single spin asymmetry @xmath3 and double spin asymmetry @xmath4 , taking into account the contributions from the twist - three quark - gluon correlation functions from one of the incident hadrons . we will limit ourselves up to this order in the calculations . for the single spin asymmetry @xmath3 , the corresponding twist - three quark - gluon correlation functions are those studied in   and the calculations will be similar . on the other hand ,",
    "for the @xmath4 asymmetry , more general quark - gluon correlation functions will contribute and the calculations will be different from those in  . following the same procedure as that in refs .  , we will compare the predictions from the two formalisms and check their consistency .    to pursue this aim , we will calculate the tmd quark distributions at large transverse momentum @xmath5 , and express them in terms of the collinear correlation functions .",
    "there are eight leading order tmd quark distributions @xcite : three @xmath6-even tmd distributions @xmath7 ; two naive - time - reversal - odd tmd quark distributions @xmath8 ( sivers function ) , @xmath9 ( boer - mulders function ) ; and three naive - time - reversal - even but @xmath6-odd tmd quark distributions @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "the transverse momentum dependence of these tmd quark distributions can be calculated from perturbative qcd in the collinear factorization framework . for the @xmath6-even tmd",
    "quark distributions , the results are well - known , and can be expressed in terms of the integrated leading - twist parton distributions ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . the naive - time - reversal - odd tmd quark distributions ( the sivers function and boer - mulders function )",
    "have also been calculated  . in this paper",
    ", we will extend these calculations to the two naive - time - reversal - even but @xmath6-odd tmd quark distributions @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "these results will depend on the the novel twist three distributions @xmath15 , @xmath16  @xcite , and the general twist - three quark - gluon correlation functions @xmath17 ,",
    "@xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "the last tmd quark distribution @xmath12 will involve twist - four quark - gluon correlation functions .",
    "we will not discuss it in this paper .",
    "the rest of paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we give a brief review on the twist - three quark - gluon collinear correlation matrix elements and discuss the relation between them and the tmd distributions .",
    "general feature of the tmd quark distributions at large transverse momentum will be presented in sec .",
    "iii . in sec .",
    "iv , we derive the naive - time - reversal - even tmd quark distributions @xmath10 , @xmath11 in the twist - three quark - gluon correlation approach . in sec .",
    "v , we calculate the relevant polarized drell - yan differential cross section using the same collinear factorization and compare to the results from the tmd factorization .",
    "we conclude the paper in sec .",
    "in order to extract more information on hadron structure , various spin dependent and/or transverse momentum dependent parton correlation functions have been introduced based on the qcd factorization theorem . they are universal between sidis and drell - yan processes ( up to a sign for the naive - time - reversal - odd tmd parton distributions ) and can be pinned down by a complete set of experiments .",
    "it has been shown that there exits interesting connections between the twist - three collinear functions and the naive - time - reversal - odd tmd quark distributions  @xcite . in this section , we will review the general property of the collinear correlation functions and introduce two novel twist - three functions @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "we will further explore their relations to the naive - time - reversal - even but @xmath6-odd tmd quark distributions @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "let us start by introducing the following collinear quark - antiquark correlation matrix : @xmath22 where @xmath23 are the hadron momentum and spin , respectively , and we have suppressed the light - cone gauge links between different fields .",
    "the hadron momentum @xmath24 is proportional to the light cone vector @xmath25 , whose conjugate light - cone vector is @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 is the momentum fraction of the hadron carried by the quark .",
    "up to twist - three level , the above matrix can be expanded as  @xcite , @xmath28 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac{m}{2p^+ } \\left [ e(x ) { \\rm 1 } + g_t(x ) \\gamma_5 s\\!\\!\\!/_\\perp + h_l(x)\\frac{\\lambda}{2 } \\gamma_5 [ p\\!\\!\\!/,n\\!\\!\\!/ ] \\right ] \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 represents the helicity for the nucleon for the longitudinal polarized nucleon , @xmath1 is the transverse polarization vector , and @xmath30 the hadron mass .",
    "the first three are the leading - twist quark distributions : spin average @xmath31 , longitudinal spin @xmath32 , and quark transversity @xmath33 distributions .",
    "the twist - three quark distributions : @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 do not have simple interpretations , and belong to more general quark - gluon correlation functions  @xcite .",
    "these correlation functions can be defined through the following matrix  @xcite , @xmath37 where we have adopted the covariant derivative as @xmath38 .",

    "one can also define a set of the @xmath43-type twist-3 correlation matrix elements , @xmath44 again , the expansion of the above matrix defines the following @xmath43-type quark - gluon correlation functions , @xmath45 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac{m}{2 } \\left [ \\tilde{t}_f^{(\\sigma)}(x , x_1 ) i\\lambda \\gamma_5 \\gamma_\\perp^\\mu p\\!\\!\\!/ + t_f^{(\\sigma)}(x , x_1 ) i\\gamma_\\perp^\\mu p\\!\\!\\!/ \\right ] \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , for convenience , we have used different normalization factors for @xmath46 and @xmath47 as compared to ref .  , with a relative factor @xmath48 .",
    "similarly , the parity and time - reversal invariance implies , @xmath49 the @xmath43-type correlation functions are usually regarded as an alternative but not independent functions in the calculations to the inclusive dis structure functions , such as @xmath50 structure function  @xcite . on the other hand , it has been found that the @xmath43-type correlation functions are more relevant for the single transverse spin asymmetry , and have been intensively studied  . by using the equation of motion ,",
    "these two types of the correlation functions can be related to each other  , @xmath51 where @xmath52 stands for the principal value , and @xmath53 are given by  @xcite , @xmath54 \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from the above results , we find that indeed the @xmath43-type and @xmath42-type correlation functions are not completely independent , and they form an over - complete set of functions . however , we still need @xmath55 and @xmath56 to completely describe the associated physics at this order , in particular , for the calculation performed in this paper . in the real calculations , we can either use @xmath42-type or @xmath43-type plus @xmath55 and @xmath56 as a complete set of twist - three functions .    in the following",
    ", we will further reveal the physical meaning of @xmath55 and @xmath56 , and build the connection between them and the transverse momentum dependent quark distributions .",
    "the tmd parton distributions are important generalization of the conventional feynman parton distributions .",
    "because of additional dependence on the transverse momentum of partons , these distributions open more opportunities to study the partonic structure in nucleon .",
    "the nontrivial correlations between the parton transverse momentum and the polarization vectors of the parent nucleon or the quark itself provide novel consequence in the transverse component in the hadronic processes , for example , the single transverse spin asymmetry . of course",
    ", upon integral over transverse momentum , these tmd parton distributions will naturally connect to the leading - twist and higher - twist parton distributions . in this paper , we will focus on the tmd quark distributions , which are relevant to the drell - yan lepton pair production .",
    "the tmd quark distributions can be defined through the following matrix  @xcite , @xmath57 where @xmath27 is the longitudinal momentum fraction and @xmath6 the transverse momentum carried by the quark .",
    "the gauge link @xmath58 is along the direction represented by @xmath59 which is conjugated to @xmath60 . in the case",
    "that we need to regulate the light - cone singularities , we will use an off - light - cone vector : @xmath61 and @xmath62 , and further define @xmath63 .",
    "compared with the integrated parton distributions definition in the above , we find that the two quark fields are not only separated by light - cone distance @xmath64 , but also by the transverse distance @xmath65 , which is conjugate to the transverse momentum of the quark @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "because of this difference , the additional transverse gauge link for the tmd parton distributions has to be contained in order to make the above quark matrix gauge invariant  @xcite , and the gauge link direction depends on the process  . since we will study the drell - yan lepton pair production in this paper , in the following we will adopt the tmd definition for this process and the gauge link will go to @xmath66  .",
    "the gauge link plays an essential role in the naive time - reversal - odd tmd parton distributions .",
    "the leading order expansion of the quark distribution matrix @xmath67 contains eight quark distributions , @xmath68\\ .",

    "they are simple extension of the above integrated quark distributions .",
    "the other five distributions are associated with the @xmath6-odd structures , and hence vanish when @xmath6 are integrated out for @xmath72 . for an unpolarized nucleon target",
    ", one can introduce the unpolarized quark distribution @xmath73 and naive - time - reversal - odd transversely - polarized quark distribution @xmath9 , the boer - mulders function . for a longitudinally - polarized nucleon ,",

    "if we weight the integral of @xmath72 with linear dependent transverse momentum , the @xmath6-odd quark distributions will lead to the higher - twist quark - gluon correlation functions  @xcite .",
    "four of them will correspond to the four quark - gluon correlation functions introduced above , including @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "the last one @xmath82 , as we mentioned , will correspond to a twist - four correlation function .",
    "first , the two naive - time - reversal - odd quark distributions @xmath80 and @xmath81 lead to the following quark - gluon correlations  , @xmath83 where the tmd quark distributions follow their definitions in the drell - yan process .",
    "similarly , the two naive - time - reversal - even but @xmath6-odd quark distributions @xmath13 and @xmath14 can be related to the following twist - three matrix element , @xmath84 here , because they are naive - time - reversal - even distributions , they will not change sign between dis and drell - yan processes . in summary , the four @xmath6-odd tmd",
    "quark distributions correspond to the four twist - three quark - gluon correlation functions introduced above eqs .",
    "( 12)-(15 ) . from these relations",
    ", we can further study the scale evolutions for the above twist three correlations  .",
    "the above relations are only one aspect of the connections between the tmd quark distributions and higher - twist quark - gluon correlation functions . in the following section",
    ", we will explore another aspect , i.e. , the large transverse momentum behavior for the tmd quark distributions in terms of the collinear leading - twist or twist - three quark - gluon correlation functions .",
    "when the @xmath6 is of the order of @xmath85 , the tmd parton distribution functions are entirely non - perturbative objects .",
