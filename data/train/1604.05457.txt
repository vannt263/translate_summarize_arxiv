    "ultracold low - dimensional atomic gases have been intensively studied over the past two decades @xcite .",
    "experimentally , they are fabricated by employing optical traps which can confine the system in one , two or three dimensions @xcite .",
    "these low dimensional systems now provide an ideal experimental tool to test fundamental problems of few- and many - body physics .",
    "the atomic interactions can be tuned in such structures by varying the trap width or with the help of magnetic feshbach resonance by varying the external magnetic field and thereby one can reach the so - called confinement induced resonance ( cir ) which was first predicted by olshanii @xcite . + cirs were confirmed in several experiments @xcite .",
    "particularly , in a prominent experiment @xcite , cir properties were studied for an ultracold quantum gas of cs atoms confined in a quasi-1d geometry with transverse anisotropy . observed splitting of the peek in atomic losses near the cir , which repeated the splitting of the binding energy of a two - atomic molecule in transverse excited state  @xcite , has stimulated different theoretical modeling  @xcite .",
    "attempts  @xcite to explain this effect in one - channel pseudopotential approach  @xcite were not successful . however , a multichannel model  @xcite , including the contribution of transversely excited channels to the confined quasi-1d scattering process , predicts a splitting in the minimum of atomic transmission curve which is qualitatively in agreement with the observed cir splitting  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , a quantitative agreement was obtained in  @xcite where sala with co - authors linked the experimentally observed effect with the possibility of two - atomic molecule formation in the center - of - mass ( cm ) excited states when the trap is assumed to be anharmonic . in this kind of traps , pair atomic collisions can lead to resonant molecule formation in the cm excited states  @xcite due to the coupling between the relative and cm motions .",
    "the model  @xcite which was dedicated to anharmonic traps was confirmed afterwards in a special experiment for the li molecule formation in slightly anisotropic and anharmonic traps  @xcite , but the observed splitting of the transmission due to the anisotropy of harmonic traps  @xcite still demands theoretical and direct experimental investigations .",
    "therefore , one of the goals of the present work was more profound theoretical study of the multichannel atomic scattering confined in harmonic but anisotropic traps by considering more realistic interatomic potentials of different effective ranges .",
    "+ for this aim , we applied here the general grid method suggested in @xcite to investigate multi - channel scattering of identical atoms confined in a transverse harmonic trap .",
    "we suggest a modification which makes the method applicable for anisotropic harmonic waveguides . in @xcite ,",
    "an interatomic potential was taken in the form @xmath0 with rather long - range interaction due to chose of rather large scaling parameter @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the appropriate unit of length for the problem . here , we study the influence of the form of the interaction potential on multi - channel elastic scattering inside an anisotropic harmonic waveguide .",
    "a spacial attention was payed to investigate how the cir can be affected by the form of the interparticle interaction and the strength of trap anisotropy .",
    "+ ultracold molecular effects have also attracted a great interest and in order to control them more effectively , we have to understand the reactive collisions of ultracold atoms @xcite .",

    "idziaszek et .",
    "al @xcite reported analytic formulas for reactive collision rates inside an isotropic harmonic waveguide . here , employing our approach we investigate the reactive rates in the presence of an isotropic as well as anisotropic transversal confinement in the case of one- and multi - mode regime , describing the reactive or inelastic part of the short - range interaction as an absorbing potential @xmath3 which we have added to a @xmath4 van der waals interaction potential .",
    "we study the collision of two identical bosonic atoms under the transverse anisotropic harmonic confinement defined by frequencies @xmath5 and @xmath6 along the @xmath7 and @xmath8 directions , respectively .",

    "<S> [ txt : abstract ] we have developed the general grid method for multi - channel scattering of bosonic atoms inside a harmonic waveguide with transverse anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> this approach is employed to analyze elastic as well as inelastic multi - channel confined scattering . for the elastic scattering , </S>",
    "<S> the effects of the range and form of interatomic potential and the waveguide anisotropy on the confinement induced resonance are studied . </S>",
    "<S> we have also investigated quantitatively the reactive rate constant in confined atom - atom collisions . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that a slight anisotropy to the confining trap considerably enhances the reactive rate constant in multi - channel regime . </S>"
