    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) materials have been extensively studied ever since a monolayer graphene was isolated by mechanical exfoliation  @xcite .",
    "thereafter , the interest was promptly extended to other 2d materials , such as hexagonal boron nitride ( h - bn ) , layered metal dichalcogenides ( lmdcs ) and phosphorene , to name a few  @xcite . in special , phosphorene",
    ", a monolayer of black phosphorus , adopts an orthorhombic structure different from graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides.@xcite this anisotropic structure is in the origin of some of phosphorene s interesting properties , such as superior flexibility under tensile strain,@xcite and giant thermoelectric coefficient.@xcite    however , the waved structure of phosphorene is shared by yet another class of 2d materials that has so far eluded attention . in the bulk form , group - iv monochalcogenides ges ,",
    "gese , sns and snse all assume structures that can be considered derivatives of the orthorhombic black phosphorus  @xcite , belonging to the space group pcmn - d@xmath0 ( lower than black phosphorus , which has only one element and therefore belongs to bmab - d@xmath1 ) .",
    "this is the @xmath2 phase of sns , also known as herzenbergite , a naturally occurring but rare mineral .- phase , with space symmetry cmcm - d@xmath3 , at higher temperature.@xcite however , according to our calculations , all of the four compounds are most stable in the @xmath2-phase on the monolayer form . ]    currently the most important prospective application of @xmath2-sns is as absorber material for film photovoltaic ( pv ) cells .",
    "although other chalcogenide materials as cdte and cuingase@xmath4 also show high pv efficiencies@xcite , many factors make their usage difficult such as the high cost and toxicity of cd  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , sns is made of abundant and nontoxic elements , and its optical band gap of @xmath5 1.3  ev@xcite is right in the range of the optimal values for solar cells ( 1.1 to 1.5 ev ) . moreover , according to a recent study , solar conversion efficiencies achieved so far for sns can be well beyond the potential limit for the material due to the poor choice of band alignment in the devices.@xcite in addition , group - iv monochalcogenides may show to be superior to other 2d semiconductors in properties where anisotropy plays an important role , as patent in the record thermoelectric coefficient recently reported for snse ( @xmath6=2.6 at 923  k).@xcite    besides , these binary ` phosphorene analogues ' are expected to reveal distinct intrinsic properties in monolayer form , as some of the lattice symmetry operations , including inversion , are only present in bulk and in even - numbered layer systems . in this sense",
    "they are different from phosphorene,@xcite where inversion symmetry prevents spin - orbit ( so ) splitting .",
    "in contrast , as shown in the present article , group - iv monochalcogenide monolayers show a large intrinsic spin - orbit splitting at valence and conduction band valleys . however , even though a few theoretical and experimental works have reported on the electronic and optical properties of monolayer or few layer sns,@xcite monolayer properties of this group remain poorly explored .    in this work ,",
    "we use first - principles calculations to investigate electronic , structural and optical properties of the four aforementioned group - iv monochalcogenides mx , with m=(sn , ge ) and x=(s , se ) , in the phosphorene - like @xmath2-phase .",
    "we compare the properties of monolayer and bilayer with those of bulk for each of these materials , highlighting the differences in the electronic and optical properties .",
    "we use first - principles calculations based on density - functional theory to obtain the electronic , structural and optical properties of monochalcogenides .",
    "we employ a first - principles approach based on kohn - sham density functional theory ( ks - dft)@xcite , as implemented in the quantum espresso code.@xcite .",
    "the exchange correlation energy is described by the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) using the pbe@xcite functional .",
    "interactions between valence and core electrons are described by troullier - martins pseudopotentials@xcite .",
    "the kohn - sham orbitals were expanded in a plane - wave basis with a cutoff energy of 70  ry , and for the charge density , a cutoff of 280  ry was used . the brillouin - zone ( bz )",
    "was sampled using a @xmath7-centered 1@xmath810@xmath810 grid following the scheme proposed by monkhorst - pack@xcite . for the optical properties ( dielectric constant and conductivity ) ,",
    "a finer 1@xmath840@xmath840 grid is employed .",
    "the calculation of the spin - orbit splitting was performed using noncolinear calculations with fully relativistic pseudopotentials .",
    "in addition , a hybrid functional approximation for the exchange - correlation term ( hse06 )  @xcite is employed in order to give reliable results for the gap energies , which are well known to be underestimated when employing semilocal gga approximations . for the hybrid functional bandstructure calculations , we used the vienna ab initio simulation package ( vasp )  @xcite with the projector - augmented wave potentials  @xcite .",
    "an energy cutoff of 40  ry was used for the plane - wave basis set and integrations over bz were performed using samples of 1@xmath88@xmath88 k - points for monolayers and bilayers and 4@xmath88@xmath88 k - points for bulk structures .    for monolayer and bilayer models , we used periodic boundary conditions along the three dimensions , with vacuum regions of 8 and 9  , respectively , between adjacent images in direction perpendicular to the layers . convergence tests with greater vacuum spacing , guarantee that this size is enough to avoid spurious interaction between neighboring images .",
    "the optical conductivity was calculated directly from the joint density of states ie .",
    "taking into account only direct excitations .",
    "the real part of the dielectric function is then calculated using the kramers - kronig relationship .",
    "the bulk @xmath2 phase has an orthorhombic structure with eight atoms per primitive unit cell , four of each species .",
    "the primitive unit cell contains two puckered layers , stacked on top of each other .",

    "[ unitcell - bz](c ) .",
    "each atomic species is covalently bonded to three neighbors of the other atomic species , forming zig - zag rows of alternating elements .",
    "thus , there is in each atom a lone pair pushing its three bonds towards a tetrahedral coordination , just like in black phosphorus , resulting in its characteristic waved structure .     and @xmath9 along the _ x _ and _ y_-directions .",
    "( d ) the respective bz and the high symmetry points @xmath7 , x , t and y. ]    we adopt the axes system used by previous works@xcite , where layers are chosen to sit on the _ x_-_y _ plane ie .",
    "perpendicular to the _ z_-direction .",
    "this is the same system conventionally used for black phosphorus , which takes the _",
    "y_-axis to be parallel to the puckering direction .",
    "each layer has three non - trivial symmetry operations , namely a vertical mirror plane parallel to the xz plane , a two - fold screw rotation along an axis parallel to y , and a glide reflexion on a plane parallel to the xy plane .",
    "the atomic positions , in units of the unit cell vectors @xmath10 , @xmath9 and @xmath11 , are @xmath12(@xmath13,@xmath14,@xmath15 ; @xmath16,@xmath14,@xmath17 ) . for bulk sns ,",
    "for example , our calculated fractional atomic coordinates are @xmath13(sn)=@xmath15(sn)=0.12 , @xmath13(s)=0.48 and @xmath15(s)=0.85 .",
    "the lattice parameters and fractional atomic positions do not deviate much from those in the parent black phosphorus structure . as can be seen in fig .",

    "it is interesting to note that the lattice parameters show little variation amongst the four compounds , differing less than 7% .",
    "this is due to the similar electronegativity of se and s , and of ge and sn , and consequently to the similar bond strengths .",
    "thus , the lattice parameter trend is mostly dominated by the ionic radius of the constituents , the most compact structure being that of ges .",

    "we have performed a systematic study of the electronic and optical properties of the family of phosphorene analogues sns , snse , ges and gese , and explored the consequences of lower dimensionality and symmetry breaking .",
    "one of the most interesting facets of these materials is that , from bulk down to monolayer , they cover a wide range of bandgap energies , from @xmath5  1.0 to 2.3  ev according to hybrid functional calculations .",
    "the bandgap increases as the number of layers is reduced , thus making it is possible to extend the absorption edge up to the green region of the spectrum .    in parallel",
    ", this family of materials has the advantage of showing little variation in lattice parameters .",
    "this makes alloying a very promising direction for tuning the optical and electronic character of the materials .",
    "further , the smallest lattice mismatch between sns and gese compounds , for both lattice parameters , can be an indication of these materials as good candidates for formation of hybrid structures.@xcite phosphorene itself has a small lattice mismatch to some of these materials , with which it can be combined .",
    "additionally , the inversion symmetry breaking in monolayer allows for spin - orbit splitting of the conduction and valence band valleys along the @xmath65 direction .",
    "this effect is absent in bulk group - iv monochalcogenides and in phosphorene .",
    "the spin - orbit splitting can be as large as 86 mev for the conduction band minimum of sns .",
    "the large spin - orbit splitting is likely due to the @xmath55 character of the vbm and cbm .",
    "the properties described here open the possibility of using group - iv monochalcogenides for optoelectronics and spintronics . despite , to our knowledge ,",
    "there being still no experimental reports of isolation of monolayers of the monochalcogenides considered here , few - layers isolation by exfoliation has already been achieved @xcite , and it is just a matter of time until control of the layer number becomes possible .",
    "finally , this illustrates that phosphorene is the parent structure of a whole class of orthorhombic 2d materials , whose potential is to be revealed once they are isolated in monolayer or few - layer form .",
