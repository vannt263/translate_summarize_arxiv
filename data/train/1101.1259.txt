    "<S> hydrogen produced from the photocatalytic splitting of water is one of the reliable alternatives to replace the polluting fossil and the radioactive nuclear fuels . here , we provide unequivocal evidence for the existence of blue- and red - shifting o@xmath0h covalent bonds within a single water molecule adsorbed on mgo surface as a result of asymmetric displacement polarizabilities . </S>",
    "<S> the adsorbed h@xmath0o@xmath0h on mgo gives rise to one weaker h@xmath0o bond , while the other o@xmath0h covalent bond from the same adsorbed water molecule compensates this effect with a stronger bond . </S>",
    "<S> the weaker bond ( nearest to the surface ) , the interlayer tunneling electrons and the silver substrate are shown to be the causes for the smallest dissociative activation energy on mgo monolayer . </S>",
    "<S> the origin that is responsible to initiate the splitting mechanism is proven to be due to the changes in the polarizability of an adsorbed water molecule , which are further supported by the temperature - dependent static dielectric constant measurements for water below the first - order electronic - phase transition temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> water molecules do not split spontaneously to give hydrogen for clean energy applications , but this is not bad at all because stable water molecules are necessary to sustain life on earth . to split them however </S>",
    "<S> , we must apply external disturbances so as to destabilize the water molecules . </S>",
    "<S> one elementary way of doing so is via the electrolysis process , in which one needs a relatively high voltage between two electrodes to split the water molecules . </S>",
    "<S> understanding how the splitting process is initiated is extremely important not only to pave the path to obtaining clean energy  @xcite , but also scientifically because this knowledge can be transferred to our understanding of the origin of chemical reactions  @xcite , beyond the standard quantum mechanical calculations of activation energies  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , we need to understand the changes to the molecule - oxide interaction strength ( that gives rise to efficient water - molecule dissociations ) under different external and/or internal disturbances . varying interaction strengths ( due to external or internal disturbances ) can be efficiently tracked and evaluated with the ionization energy theory ( iet )  @xcite that relies on the energy - level spacing renormalization technique  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> acquiring such knowledge ( how water molecules split in the presence of disturbances ) require us to go beyond the standard procedure of describing the existence of dissociation energy profile , or the profile of energy levels before and after a particular dissociative reaction path . </S>",
    "<S> such path defines the existence of an activation energy for a given reaction and its thermodynamic process ( endothermic or exothermic ) , but never on why and how this activation energy changes for different interaction strengths . here , we give unambiguous explanations ( i ) how to track the changes to the interaction strengths between a water molecule and a given oxide surface , and ( ii ) why the above interaction strengths vary when exposed to a polarizable ion or surface . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical discussions given here are general and therefore can be applied to other chemical reactions with modifications , depending upon the complexity of the molecules . in a previous report by shin et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , two types of water molecule dissociation pathways have been selectively achieved by inducing interlayer tunneling electrons through a single water molecule . </S>",
    "<S> these dissociations , as well as the water molecule diffusion ( due to desorption and hopping ) have been observed with the scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the first dissociation path requires higher energy because it is due to electronic excitations . whereas , vibrational excitations ( for high tunneling current ) </S>",
    "<S> were found to be responsible for the initiation of low - energy dissociation due to the asymmetric stretching mode , @xmath1 ( @xmath2 448 mev )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , at low tunneling current , both the scissoring mode , @xmath3 ( @xmath2 217 mev ) and @xmath1 contribute to the water - molecule desorption and hopping .    </S>",
    "<S> there are four types of molecule - oxide interactions ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] ) that can be used to understand the chain of events required to initiate the water molecule dissociation on oxides as stated above . in doing so </S>",
    "<S> , we will be able to achieve the motivations listed in ( i ) and ( ii ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we exploit these information to reinforce the accuracy of the hermansson blue - shifting hydrogen - bond theory  @xcite , and invoke the temperature ( @xmath4)-dependent static dielectric constant measurements  @xcite of water for 0.1 , 1 , 10 and 100 mpa within iet to prove that our water splitting mechanism is indeed unambigous below the first - order electronic - phase transition temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the analyses are entirely analytic and based on the mathematically well - defined ionization energy approximation , which is self - consistent both qualitatively and quantitatively  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> first , we note that the electrons from these cations , 2h@xmath5 and mg@xmath6 determine the polarizability of their respective independent system , h@xmath7o molecule and mgo crystal . </S>",
    "<S> their polarizability can be evaluated from their averaged ionization energies , which are given by 1312 and 1094 kjmol@xmath8 for 2h@xmath5 and mg@xmath6 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the averaged atomic ionization energy values for all the elements considered in this work are given in table  [ table : i ] , in which , the averaging follows ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> prior to averaging , all the atomic ionization energies were taken from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the polarizability magnitudes can be calculated from  @xcite    @xmath9}{(\\omega_{\\rm{ph}}^2 - \\omega^2)}\\bigg ] . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{eq:1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here , @xmath10 is the phonon frequency of undeformable ions , @xmath11 denotes the averaged ionization energy , @xmath12 is the fermi level when @xmath4 equals zero ( and independent of any disturbance ) , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the respective positively and negatively charged ions mass due to their different individual polarizabilities , @xmath16 , in which , @xmath17 is the bohr radius of atomic hydrogen , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the electron charge and the permittivity of free space , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the above definition for @xmath12 implies that @xmath12 can also be associated to the sachdev critical tuning point , which defines the quantum phase transitions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , one can obtain free - electron metals for electrons with energies @xmath20 , while non - free - electron property prevails for @xmath21  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> equation  ( [ eq:1 ] ) gives us the direct relationship between the constituent atomic ionization energies ( types of ions ) and the ionic polarizabilities ( with renormalized electronic contribution ) .    </S>",
    "<S> however , eq .  ( [ eq:1 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> does not apply for the diffusion of nanoparticles ( classical ) in the colloidal system  @xcite , where the non - existence of the energy - level spacing and polarizability effects for these nanoparticles have been correctly justified . in the case of iet </S>",
    "<S> , the polarizability of one ion , affects its nearest neighbor , and then its next nearest neighbor , and so on depending on the strength of the polarization , which in turn gives rise to the long - range coulomb interaction . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> undeformable ( charged or uncharged ) nanoparticles always satisfy the first - order - short - range interaction that can be treated with classical formalism  @xcite , which is not suitable if the long - range coulomb interaction dominates  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : i ]    from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:1 ] ) and table  [ table : i ] , one finds @xmath23 and @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , one can also use eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:1 ] ) to obtain fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] that depicts the importance of water - solid interactions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but let us first derive the above inequalities from the following analysis , which is somewhat subtle , but it will be clear once the electron - transfer between ions are understood . </S>",
    "<S> we first need to determine the reason why h acts as a cation , and o as an anion in a h@xmath7o molecule within the ionization energy theory . in order to do so </S>",
    "<S> , we need to consider the ionization - energy inequality between 2h@xmath5 and o@xmath6 , which is given by @xmath25 ( see table  [ table : i ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the effective electron - transfer is from h to o atom due to @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , we can now extend this argument to claim that the electron - transfer in mgo system is from mg to o atom due to @xmath27 , which implies @xmath24 from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:1 ] ) and table  [ table : i ] . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the electrons from 2h@xmath28 and mg@xmath6 are the ones that will contribute to the polarizabilities of h@xmath7o and mgo surface , respectively .    here </S>",
    "<S> , we generalize the water - mgo surface interaction as follows@xmath0 if we have a reactive surface with dangling bonds and defects such that the surface electrons are more strongly polarizable ( reactive ) than the gas molecules , then the stronger interaction between the surface and a molecule leads to an effective physisorption ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , these polarizability - dependent physisorption mechanism can only be true for a certain narrow temperature - window ( @xmath29 to @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) or at low temperatures . for @xmath32 , </S>",
    "<S> this attractive interaction remains attractive due to insufficient thermal energy to overcome the strength of physisorption . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , higher temperatures ( @xmath33 ) could lead to chemisorption due to chemical reaction ( not shown ) or desorption ( hopping ) as depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](d ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig:1](a ) defines the short - range coulomb interaction as predicted for classical nanoparticles  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> apparently , this narrow window depends on the types of solid surfaces and molecules where ( a ) larger polarizability of a given molecule will have a stronger physisorption onto the smaller polarizable solid surface , [ see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig:1](b ) ] . similarly , ( b ) larger polarizable solid surfaces ( compared to molecules ) are also suitable to obtain an effective physisorption [ see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](c ) ] . on the contrary , ( c ) unpolarized systems do not interact because the electrons from these two entities have large ionization energies ( thus , weaker polarization ) , for example , atomic inert noble gases do not easily interact at quantum level [ see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](a ) ] . at the other extreme , ( d ) </S>",
    "<S> two highly polarizable components will give rise to an enhanced desorption , which is undesirable because they can be easily evaporated due to polarized @xmath18-@xmath18 repulsion  @xcite [ see fig .  [ fig:1](d ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> such a repulsive interaction has been predicted between a single si ion on the sic surface in the presence of electric fields . </S>",
    "<S> here , the si ions ( with high polarizability ) tend to diffuse and evaporate easily from the sic substrate compared to c ions ( that have small polarizability )  @xcite . of course , these four mechanisms are strictly valid only within that narrow temperature range or at low temperatures as pointed out earlier .    </S>",
    "<S> our focus here however is to exploit the information obtained from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] to determine the physico - chemical properties of a given catalyst needed to split the water molecules efficiently . </S>",
    "<S> apparently , this catalyst is one of the most sought after component for photocatalytic water splitting  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> parallel to this , mgo surface on ag(100 ) substrate has been investigated for its suitability as a catalyst to split a single water molecule by activating its vibrational and electronic excitations selectively  @xcite . in order to make this vibration - induced dissociation mechanism explicit </S>",
    "<S> , we will need to first explain the effect of mgo surface polarizability as a result of ag substrate underneath . </S>",
    "<S> one layer of mgo grown on ag(100 ) will have a larger polarizability ( on the mgo surface ) compared to a two or more mgo layers ( we assume defect - free mgo and ag(100 ) structures ) . </S>",
    "<S> this larger surface polarizability originates from the electrons contributed by the ag layer ( a free electron metal ) , in which , mgo is an insulator and thus its ( mgo ) surface polarizability is much smaller based on iet . </S>",
    "<S> for a two - layer mgo on ag(100 ) , the effect of free electrons from ag is reduced , giving rise to a lower polarizability of mgo surface than on a single - layer mgo surface  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , one can expect a systematic lowering of the mgo surface polarizability with the increasing number of mgo layers before achieving the bulk mgo polarizability value . </S>",
    "<S> note here that mgo is the least polarizable material compared to ag .    </S>",
    "<S> having found the reason for mgo surface polarizability as due to the ag(100 ) substrate ( free electron metal ) , we can now go on and develop the mechanism that gives rise to a single water molecule dissociation on one or more mgo layers . </S>",
    "<S> there are two possibilities for a h@xmath34o@xmath35 molecule to be adsorbed on a mg@xmath6o@xmath35 monolayer . </S>",
    "<S> one of them is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2]a , in which , the oxygen anion ( from water ) is adsorbed on the bridge site surrounded by two mg@xmath6 and o@xmath36 surface ions such that the two unadsorbed hydrogen ions ( from the water molecule ) have the same probability to be dissociated . here , h@xmath37 and h@xmath38 </S>",
    "<S> ions are dangling upward ( not adsorbed ) and their nearest surface neighbors are o@xmath36 ions . </S>",
    "<S> this configuration is energetically not favorable compared to the one shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2]b , however , the former configuration is possible in a nonequilibrium condition ( with fluctuating energies at nanoscale ) . </S>",
    "<S> one reason to focus on this particular physisorption ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2]a ) is that it is the only alternative configuration that will give rise to the dissociated product , oh@xmath39 on the bridge site directly . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the physisorption depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2]b was predicted to be stable from the density functional theory ( dft ) calculations  @xcite , and this configuration requires re - adsorption of oh@xmath39 on the bridge site , after dissociation . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is important to exclude the physisorption shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2]a as a possibility , which can be done using iet .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2]b , the electronic polarization on the surface of mgo monolayer [ grown on ag(100 ) ] is the largest and is expected to gradually decrease with the number of mgo layers ( for example , from one to three monolayers ) due to the insulating character of mgo . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , one can evaluate eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:1 ] ) to obtain the largest attractive potential between a positively charged hydrogen ion ( h@xmath40 ) and the negatively charged surface oxygen ion ( o@xmath41 ) . </S>",
    "<S> such stronger attractive interaction will cause the covalent bond between h@xmath40 and o@xmath42 ( oxygen ion from the adsorbed water molecule ) to be weaker ( smaller @xmath1 )  @xcite . here , we have used @xmath43 and @xmath44 instead of 1 + and 2@xmath0 for hydrogen and oxygen ions , respectively , so that we can accommodate the changes of these charges as a result of their changing polarizabilities ( due to temperature , increasing mgo layers , chemical compositions and defects ) . </S>",
    "<S> the surface - electron polarization induced attractive potential between h@xmath40 and o@xmath41 has a similar effect to the hydrogen bonds between water molecules in liquid or solid state ( ice ) . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , this attractive potential should reduce both the symmetric and asymmetric ( @xmath1 ) stretching vibrational frequencies for the adsorbed water molecule such that @xmath1 value should be lower than the water vapour ( isolated water molecules ) .    as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> we anticipate @xmath1 to range between 454 mev ( for water vapour ) and 441 mev ( for liquid phase water at 313 k ) or lower . </S>",
    "<S> the above stated values for @xmath1 were measured and reported in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such an inverse proportionality between @xmath1 and the polarization induced attractive potential ( or the hydrogen bonds between water molecules ) arises from the fact that the strength of the charge @xmath45 from h@xmath40 is reduced by the strongly polarized o@xmath41 as seen by the o@xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the stronger attractive coulomb potential ( @xmath46 ) between h@xmath40 and o@xmath41 will reduce the ability of h@xmath40 to attract its own ( shared ) electron from the electron - rich o@xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , one gets a stronger electric dipole moment ( @xmath47 ) between h@xmath40 and o@xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for this stronger @xmath47 can be understood by first noting that the above @xmath46 gives rise to smaller @xmath18-@xmath18 interaction , for example , between the electrons from o@xmath48 and o@xmath36 through h@xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that h@xmath37 effectively screens and reduces the @xmath18-@xmath18 interaction between those two oxygen ions . </S>",
    "<S> this in turn implies a smaller shankar - type screened coulomb potential  @xcite , which can be evaluated from  @xcite    @xmath49 } , \\label{eq:2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath50 is the screening constant of proportionality . </S>",
    "<S> equation  ( [ eq:2 ] ) indicates that after the physisorption , one obtains a smaller @xmath51 as a result of smaller @xmath52 . in other words , @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> having found the reason why physisorption reduces the ionization energy , @xmath51 for the electron shared between o@xmath48 and h@xmath37 , we can now move on and define    @xmath54    here , @xmath55 is the electron coordinate , @xmath56 and @xmath57 represent the many - body ( a water molecule adsorbed on an oxide surface ) wave functions for the upper and lower states , respectively , and @xmath58 denotes the microscopic electric field between o@xmath48 and h@xmath37 . fortunately , iet does not require us to evaluate the matrix elements in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:3 ] ) , or to even know the true wave functions  @xcite . from @xmath53 , eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:1 ] ) and  ( [ eq:3 ] ) , we can arrive at the conclusion we stated earlier@xmath0 water molecule physisorption ( as depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2]b ) causes a stronger electric dipole moment between o@xmath48 and h@xmath37 .    </S>",
    "<S> apart from that , smaller @xmath51 also means a weaker h@xmath40@xmath0o@xmath42 covalent bond or smaller @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the covalent bonds considered here are of the same kind , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , hence we need not be concerned with the inverse proportionality between the polarizability and bonding energy discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , in which the inverse proportionality was calculated and justified between two different gas molecules ( co and o@xmath7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the measured @xmath1 value for a single water molecule adsorbed on mgo monolayer is 448 mev at 4.2 k  @xcite , which is indeed within the expected range ( @xmath61 454 mev ) . </S>",
    "<S> one should also be aware here that the o@xmath0h covalent bond in water molecules discussed thus far is still very much stronger than the hydrogen - type bonds , whether the molecule is adsorbed on mgo surface or exists in liquid water or ice .    </S>",
    "<S> we have now established the reasons why and how one of the covalent bond in a single water molecule ( h@xmath40@xmath0o@xmath42 : see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2]b ) can be weakened with physisorption ( similar to hydrogen - bond effect ) . </S>",
    "<S> the consequence of this scenario is that one will obtain a stronger h@xmath62@xmath0o@xmath42 covalent bond as a result of the weaker @xmath47 between h@xmath62 and o@xmath42 because @xmath63 @xmath61 @xmath64 and therefore , @xmath65 . here </S>",
    "<S> , h@xmath62 is a dangling ( not adsorbed ) ion . </S>",
    "<S> these inequalities tell us that h@xmath40@xmath0o@xmath42 is the weaker covalent bond , and is susceptible to break in the presence of interlayer tunneling electrons . this bond becomes weaker because the electron , which is originally from h@xmath37 that was shared with o@xmath48 to form the covalent bond is no longer effectively shared between h@xmath37 and o@xmath48 in the presence of the above - stated physisorption ( or in the presence of hydrogen bonds ) . </S>",
    "<S> this in turn implies that the electron that was originally from h@xmath37 is now strongly bound to o@xmath48 because h@xmath37 now interacts attractively with the polarized electrons from o@xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , this conclusion is also in agreement with the experimentally indirectly observed dissociated chemical species ( oh@xmath39 ) that is found to be adsorbed on a different site ( bridge site ) after the water molecule dissociation  @xcite . in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have given a rigorous and self - consistent explanation on the water molecule dissociation reported in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite using iet and its polarizability functional . along the way </S>",
    "<S> , we have also identified which o@xmath0h covalent bond is weaker or most likely to be breakable , again in agreement with the experiment  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> now we are ready to prove the correctness of the hermansson blue - shifting hydrogen - bond theory  @xcite in a straightforward manner using eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:1 ] ) ,  ( [ eq:3 ] ) and our hydrogen - bond - like physisorption scenario between o@xmath36 and h@xmath37 . for example , at intermolecular equilibrium distance , the electric - field interactions and exchange overlap were found to be responsible for the negative value for @xmath66@xmath67 that gives rise to the blue - shifting hydrogen bond  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this effect can be understood within iet by writing    @xmath68    here , @xmath67 is the effective separation ( distance ) between h@xmath37 and o@xmath36 ions , @xmath69 denotes the ionization energy that determines the polarizability of o@xmath36 ion and @xmath70 is the microscopic electric field between o@xmath36 and h@xmath37 ions . </S>",
    "<S> the effective separation here means the distance from the outer core electron ( unpolarized ) of o@xmath36 ion to the outer radius of h@xmath37 ion . </S>",
    "<S> this definition avoids the contribution from different ionic sizes . </S>",
    "<S> equation  ( [ eq:4 ] ) clearly points out the existence of blue - shifting attractive interaction ( physisorption ) for small @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> this stronger interaction is similar to the blue - shifting hydrogen - bond effect discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis that follows to explain the physisorption - induced bond ( similar to hydrogen bonds ) is different such that it requires the energy levels from o@xmath36 do not cross ( to form covalent or ionic bond ) with the energy levels associated to h@xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> this is why @xmath11 is deliberately written as @xmath69 , and not @xmath71 , in which , the latter notation is for the bonds with crossed energy - levels between o@xmath36 and h@xmath37 .    </S>",
    "<S> the validity of the above proportionality ( eq .  ( [ eq:4 ] ) ) can be verified by noting that for this particular system , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath67 @xmath72 @xmath69 because smaller @xmath69 implies stronger coulomb attraction between ( the easily polarizable ) o@xmath73 and h@xmath74 ions , and therefore smaller @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that if h@xmath74 ion is positioned far from o@xmath73 ( large @xmath67 ) , then h@xmath74 will induce a small electronic polarization on o@xmath73 , which seems to imply that @xmath69 is large . </S>",
    "<S> we stress here that this implication does not provide a valid cause - and - effect relationship at all , because obviously large @xmath67 does not cause @xmath69 to be large ( to give small polarization ) in any way . </S>",
    "<S> however , the opposite is true , meaning , large @xmath69 causes the effective separation to be large , which explains why @xmath11 can be used to determine the crystal structure of a particular system for a given condition . </S>",
    "<S> recall here that we have applied this proportionality ( @xmath75 ) earlier such that @xmath76 @xmath72 @xmath77 in which , large mgo surface polarization ( due to small @xmath77 ) is expected if @xmath76 is small . here , small @xmath77 is due to the free - electrons contributed by the metallic ag substrate .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we need to exclude an alternative water molecule configuration ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2]a ) proposed earlier based on the experimental results obtained by shin et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in this configuration , </S>",
    "<S> the negatively charged o@xmath42 ion at the bridge site , remains there after the dissociation , which does not require any re - adsorption of the dissociated product ( oh@xmath39 ) . whereas , the most stable configuration depicted in fig .  [ fig:2]b requires re - adsorption of oh@xmath39 on the bridge site after dissociation . the configuration in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig:2]a requires the physisorped o@xmath78 ion onto the bridge site to satisfy the inequality @xmath79 , hence there is an effective attraction between o@xmath78 ion and its nearest neighbors ( two mg@xmath6 and two o@xmath73 ions ) . </S>",
    "<S> such an attractive interaction is energetically favorable ( in nonequilibrium conditions : fluctuating energy at nanoscale ) because it is similar to the experimentally observed oh@xmath80 ion adsorbed on the bridge site after dissociation . </S>",
    "<S> the oxygen ion from a single water molecule physisorped on the bridge site will lead to the inequality @xmath81 </S>",
    "<S> @xmath61 @xmath82 due to the existence of an effective @xmath46 between o@xmath78 and mg@xmath6 .    </S>",
    "<S> contrary to the discussion given earlier based on fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2]b , the configuration depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2]a gives rise to a stronger @xmath18-@xmath18 interaction within the o@xmath78 ion if @xmath46 between o@xmath78 and mg@xmath6 ions gets stronger . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the @xmath18-@xmath18 interaction stated here is between the two electrons from h@xmath37 and h@xmath38 ions . as a consequence , the stronger </S>",
    "<S> @xmath46 reduces the screening strength between these two electrons ( now strongly interacting ) within the physisorped o@xmath78 ion that allows us to write @xmath46 @xmath83 . as such , from eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:1 ] ) and  ( [ eq:2 ] ) , we can readily conclude that one needs a higher energy to excite an electron from the physisorped o@xmath78 ion ( due to @xmath84 ) , which implies stronger covalent bonds between o@xmath78 and its two dangling hydrogen ions . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the asymmetric vibrational frequency , @xmath1 is expected to be larger than that of an isolated water molecule , or @xmath85 454 mev ( water vapour ) , which is invalid based on the experimental result ( 448 mev ) reported in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> there is however one last obstacle that needs to be overcome in order to complete the analysis on water - molecule splitting mechanism unequivocally , and with high - level self - consistency@xmath0 the @xmath4-dependent static dielectric constant ( @xmath86 ) of water must obey the phenomenological theory of dielectricity derived in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the renormalized  @xcite    @xmath87 \\label{eq:5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    is @xmath4-independent , where @xmath88 , @xmath89 denotes the wave number , @xmath90 and @xmath91 is the free - electron carrier density at @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , one needs to transform eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:5 ] ) to obtain a new @xmath4-dependent constant ,    @xmath93 + o[t , p,\\rho ] . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{eq:6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here , @xmath94 and @xmath95 are constants of proportionality , while @xmath96[@xmath97 is introduced by - hand to represent other ( including higher order ) terms that captures the power - law behaviors due to @xmath4 , pressure ( @xmath98 ) and density - of - water ( @xmath99 ) effects . </S>",
    "<S> traditionally , @xmath86 is written as a function that obeys only the power - law with up to ten numerical ( both positive and negative ) constants  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this explains why the term @xmath96[@xmath97 exists in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:6 ] ) , and its experimental justifications were also given by uematsu and franck  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the above transformation reads @xmath100 } \\longrightarrow \\gamma\\exp{[-\\lambda\\eta ' k_bt]}$ ] , where the physically relevant transformation is @xmath101 , which can be understood within the water molecule dissociation mechanism explained earlier . </S>",
    "<S> this means that we need to establish @xmath102 , which is not a cause - and - effect relationship but can be exploited to carry out the above transformation . </S>",
    "<S> the logic behind this proportionality is due to ( i ) @xmath103 and ( ii ) @xmath104 , and therefore , @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> most importantly , eq .  ( [ eq:6 ] ) also defines the existence of a first - order transition temperature ( @xmath106 ) such that @xmath107 $ ] dominates for @xmath108 and @xmath109 \\rightarrow 0 $ ] . on the other hand , @xmath109 </S>",
    "<S> $ ] becomes the dominant term for @xmath110 and @xmath107 \\rightarrow 0 $ ] .    </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the existence of @xmath106 has been established experimentally and via simulations in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , for instance , the transition from arrhenius ( exponential - type ) behavior at low temperatures ( below the widom temperature , @xmath111 ) to the power - law behavior for @xmath112 . </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath113 because @xmath106 here means the electronic - phase transition temperature where @xmath110 is the regime with no electronic interaction ( that can cause changes to the molecular energy levels ) between water molecules . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig:3 ] shows the theoretical fits of @xmath86 based on eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:6 ] ) and the range of its fitting parameters , indicating the dominant roles played by the polarization induced @xmath18-@xmath18 interaction and @xmath47 below @xmath106 , in agreement with the water - molecule splitting mechanism presented earlier . </S>",
    "<S> the correctness of the exponential term is also logically justified because @xmath4 influences the electronic excitation probability , as it should be . on the contrary , @xmath98 does not influence the above probability directly nor significantly and therefore , one obtains an almost perfect linear fit between @xmath86 and @xmath98 for a given @xmath4 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3]e ) .    in conclusion , hydrogen produced from the photocatalytic splitting of water may or may not completely replace the polluting fossil and/or the radioactive nuclear fuels because such a replacement depends on the toxicity and recoverability of the catalysts used . but </S>",
    "<S> any form of alternative clean energy , including hydrogen from water is worth exploring to diversify the energy supply to some extent . in this regard </S>",
    "<S> , we have clearly explained that the root cause responsible to the water molecule splitting is because one of its o@xmath0h bonds become weaker when exposed to external disturbances . </S>",
    "<S> this weaker bond has its hydrogen ion adsorbed on the oxide surface . </S>",
    "<S> such an adsorption exists due to the polarization - induced attractive interaction between a positively charged hydrogen ion and the negatively charged surface oxygen ion . </S>",
    "<S> this coulomb interaction results in the modification of the electron - electron interaction and subsequently to a stronger electric dipole moment , and finally to a weaker o@xmath0h bond ( the hydrogen ion here is adsorbed onto the surface oxygen ion ) . </S>",
    "<S> the other o@xmath0h bond dangles upward ( this hydrogen ion remains unadsorbed ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , this weaker bond , which is susceptible , gives in to the interlayer tunneling electrons and leaves behind the dissociated product , oh@xmath80 ion re - adsorbed on the bridge site ( surrounded by two magnesium and two oxygen ions ) .    on the way to make the above mechanism explicit and unequivocal , </S>",
    "<S> we have also excluded one other water molecule configuration because it may be energetically favorable in nonequilibrium conditions for two reasons@xmath0 ( a ) this new physisorption does not require re - adsorption of oh@xmath80 ion on the bridge site after dissociation and ( b ) oh@xmath80 ion is found to be stable on the bridge site . however , this configuration is found to be invalid due to its larger o@xmath0h asymmetric vibrational frequency , which is predicted to be larger than that of an isolated water molecule . </S>",
    "<S> apart from that , the water splitting mechanism proven here is also found to be consistent with other established theories , simulations and measurements . in particular , the hermansson blue - shifting hydrogen - bond theory , the phenomenological theory of dielectricity , and the temperature - dependent static dielectric constant measurements of water for different pressures and below the first - order electronic - phase transition temperature . as a matter of fact </S>",
    "<S> , this mechanism will be further exploited to understand the reasons why and how water molecules may activate the large biomolecules , including dna , and how they bring biological systems to `` life '' . </S>"
