    "a notable feature in the development of hierarchical and bayesian nonparametric models is the role of mixing measures , which help to combine relatively simple models into richer classes of statistical models  @xcite . in recent years",
    "the mixture modeling methodology has been significantly extended by many authors taking the mixing measure to be random and infinite - dimensional via suitable priors constructed in a nested , hierarchical and nonparametric manner .",
    "this results in rich models that can fit more complex and high - dimensional data ( see , e.g. , @xcite for several examples of such models , as well as a recent book @xcite ) .",
    "the focus of this paper is to analyze convergence behavior of the posterior distribution of latent mixing measures as they arise in several mixture models , including finite mixtures and the infinite dirichlet process mixtures .",

    "atoms @xmath2 s are elements in space @xmath3 , while vector of probabilities @xmath4 lies in a @xmath5-dimensional probability simplex . in a mixture setting , @xmath6 is combined with a likelihood density @xmath7 with respect to a dominating measure @xmath8 on @xmath9 , to yield the mixture density : @xmath10 . in a clustering application ,",
    "atoms @xmath2 s represent distinct behaviors in a heterogeneous data population , while mixing probabilities @xmath11 s are the associated proportions of such behaviors . under this interpretation , there is a need for comparing and assessing the quality of mixing measure @xmath12 estimated on the basis of available data .",
    "an important work in this direction is by chen  @xcite , who used the @xmath13 metric on the cumulative distribution functions on the real line to study convergence rates of the mixing measure @xmath6 .",
    "chen s results were subsequently extended to a bayesian estimation setting for a univariate mixture model  @xcite .",
    "these works were limited to only univariate and finite mixture models , with @xmath14 bounded by a known constant , while our interest is when @xmath14 may be unbounded and @xmath3 is multidimensional or even an abstract space .",
    "the analysis of consistency and convergence rates of posterior distributions for bayesian estimation has seen much progress in the past decade .",
    "key recent references include @xcite .",
    "analysis of specific mixture models in a bayesian setting has also been studied @xcite .",
    "all these works primarily focus on the convergence behavior of the posterior distribution of the data density  @xmath15 . on the other hand ,",
    "results concerned with the convergence behavior of latent mixing measures @xmath6 are quite rare .",
    "notably , the analysis of convergence for mixing ( smooth ) densities often arises in the context of frequentist estimation for deconvolution problems , mainly within the kernel density estimation method ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we also note recent progress on consistent parameter estimation for certain finite mixture models , for example , in an overfitted setting  @xcite or with an emphasis on computational efficiency  @xcite .",
    "the primary contribution of this paper is to show that the wasserstein distances provide a natural and useful metric for the analysis of convergence for latent mixing measures in mixture models , and to establish convergence rates of posterior distributions in a number of well - known bayesian nonparametric and mixture models .",
    "wasserstein distances originally arose in the problem of optimal transportation  @xcite .",
    "although not as popular as well - known divergence functionals such as kullback  leibler , total variation and hellinger distances , wasserstein distances have been utilized in a number of statistical contexts ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) . for discrete probability measures , they can be obtained by a minimum matching ( or moving ) procedure between the sets of atoms that provide support for the measures under comparison , and consequentially are simple to compute .",
    "suppose that @xmath3 is equipped with a metric @xmath16 .",
    "let @xmath17 .",

    "as clearly seen from this definition , wasserstein distances inherit directly the metric of the space of atomic support @xmath3 , suggesting that they can be useful for assessing estimation procedures for discrete measures in hierarchical models .",
    "it is worth noting that if @xmath26 is a sequence of discrete probability measures with @xmath14 distinct atoms and @xmath27 tends to some discrete measure @xmath28 in the @xmath29 metric , then @xmath27 s ordered set of atoms must converge to @xmath28 s atoms in @xmath16 after some permutation of atom labels .",
    "thus , in the clustering application illustrated above , convergence of mixing measure @xmath6 may be interpreted as the convergence of distinct typical behavior @xmath2 s that characterize the heterogeneous data population .",
    "a hint for the relevance of the wasserstein distances can be drawn from an observation that the @xmath13 distance for the cdfs of univariate random variables , as studied by chen  @xcite , is in fact a special case of the @xmath30 metric when @xmath31 .",
    "the plan for the paper is as follows .",

    "we produce a simple lemma which gives an upper bound on @xmath0-divergences between mixture densities by certain wasserstein distances between mixing measures .",
    "this implies that @xmath29 topology can be stronger than those induced by divergences between mixture densities .",
    "next , we consider various identifiability conditions under which convergence of mixture densities entails convergence of mixing measures in a wasserstein metric .",
    "we present two key theorems , which provide upper bounds on @xmath32 in terms of divergences between @xmath15 and @xmath33 .",
