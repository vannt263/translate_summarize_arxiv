    "the control theory is the analysis of controlled dynamical systems .",
    "these systems are varied : they can be differential , stochastic or discrete .",
    "the optimal control theory concerns the determination of a control optimizing a certain cost .",
    "consequently , this theory is strongly connected to the 18@xmath0 century classical mechanic ( variational principles , euler - lagrange equations , etc . , see @xcite ) .",
    "since the second world war , this theory has a considerable development and one can find applications in many domains : celestial mechanic @xcite , biology @xcite , hydroelectricity @xcite , economy @xcite , etc .",
    "the subject is widely treated and one can find a lot of references on the subject , see for example @xcite .    the fractional calculus , _ i.e. _ the mathematical field dealing with the generalization of the derivative to any real order , plays an increasing role in many varied domains as economy @xcite or probability @xcite .",
    "fractional derivatives also appear in many fields of physics ( see @xcite ) : wave mechanic @xcite , viscoelasticity @xcite , thermodynamics @xcite , fluid mechanic in heterogeneous media @xcite , etc .",
    "a natural question then arises : _ can we develop optimal control theories for fractional differential systems ? _    recently , a subtopic of the fractional calculus gains importance : it concerns the variational principles on functionals involving fractional derivatives .",
    "this leads to the statement of fractional euler - lagrange equations , see @xcite .",
    "a direct consequence is the emergence of works concerning a particular class of fractional optimal control problems , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "these studies usually use the lagrange multiplier technique allowing to write these problems as problems of optimization without constraint of _ augmented functionals_. with a calculus of variations , authors then obtain a necessary condition for the existence of an optimal control .",
    "this condition is commonly given as the existence of a solution of a system of fractional differential equations called _ fractional pontryagin s system_. + in this paper , we first give a new presentation of this result .",
    "precisely , making an additional assumption ( see condition ) , we rewrite _ directly _ these fractional optimal control problems as simpler problems of optimization without constraint of functionals _ depending only on the control_. with a calculus of variations , we finally conclude to the same necessary condition but with a new presentation .",
    "although the method here used is considerably inspired by the lagrange multiplier technique , it allows us to give a complete proof using only classical mathematical tools adapted to the fractional case : _ calculus of variations _ , _ gronwall s lemma _ , _ cauchy - lipschitz theorem _ and _ stability under perturbations of differential equations_.    nevertheless , the explicit computation of controls satisfying the above necessary condition needs the resolution of the fractional pontryagin s system which is a main drawback .",
    "indeed , solving a fractional differential equation is in general very difficult .",
    "consequently , in this paper , we suggest a deviously way in order to get informations on the solutions of a fractional pontryagin s system .",
    "precisely , we study the existence of classical conservation laws , _ i.e. _ functions which are constant on each solution .",
    "indeed , constants of motion , generally associated to physical quantities , give strong informations on the solutions in the phase space for example . moreover ,",
    "they also can be used in order to reduce or integrate the system by quadrature .",
    "previous results in this direction have been obtained by torres and frederico in @xcite .",
    "however , in each of these papers , the conservation law is not explicit but implicitly defined by a functional relation . in this paper , inspired by a recent result obtained in @xcite , we prove a fractional noether s theorem providing an explicit conservation law for fractional pontryagin s systems exhibiting a symmetry .    in this paper",
    ", we also suggest :    * a link between classical optimal control problems and their fractional versions via the stanislavsky s formalism ( see @xcite ) ; * a solved fractional example allowing to test numerical schemes in the strict fractional case .     + the paper is organized as follows .",
    "firstly , we remind some classical definitions and results concerning fractional calculus ( section [ section1 ] ) .",
    "then , we present the class of fractional optimal control problems studied and the usual strategy using the lagrange multiplier ( section [ section21 ] ) .",
    "then , assuming an additional condition on the problem , we develop a new proof leading to the same result with a different presentation , see section [ section22 ] .",
    "we then suggest a way in order to transit from a classical optimal control problem to its fractional version via the stanislavsky s formalism ( section [ section3 ] ) .",
    "subsequently , we suggest some examples with , in particular , a solved fractional example allowing to test numerical schemes in the strict fractional case ( section [ section4 ] ) .",
    "finally , in section [ section5 ] , we state a fractional noether s theorem for fractional pontryagin s systems admitting a symmetry . technical proofs of lemmas are provided in appendix [ appa ] .",
