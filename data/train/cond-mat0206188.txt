    "the flow properties of granular materials puzzle engineers and physicists alike . despite numerous experimental studies of heap flows , avalanches , and chute flows ,",
    "there still does not exist a general consensus on the nature of _ typical _ granular flow .",
    "early systematic experiments in inclined plane geometries were concerned with flow rates of granular material down chutes @xcite , usually with smooth bases .",
    "large regions of plug flow were observed , i.e. the whole bulk of the material slid down the plane at a velocity determined by the input mass rate and inclination angle of the chute .",
    "kinetic theories for the inclined plane problem can explain some aspects of this flow behaviour for nearly elastic particles on smooth chutes @xcite .",
    "other studies have determined structural features in the flow in two dimensional ( 2d ) experiments @xcite and simulations @xcite .",
    "still , there has not been the same success in predicting flows down rough inclines for inelastic , frictional particles .",
    "detailed measuring techniques have been developed recently to capture various flow properties of granular material down rough inclined planes @xcite and in heap flow geometries @xcite . accompanying these more thorough experiments ,",
    "further theoretical treatments have also emerged @xcite , together with full three dimensional ( 3d ) computer simulations @xcite . despite this growth in literature , there appears to be a disturbing feature of these studies : reports on quantities such as velocity profiles differ quite dramatically . while some reports are agreement with the pioneering results of bagnold @xcite , others are not .    in 1954 , bagnold @xcite proposed a momentum transfer picture to describe his experimental results on inertial granular flow",
    ". this simple 2d model describes the collisional process between particle layers during flow .",
    "the resulting relations predict a shear stress @xmath11 that is proportional to the square of the strain - rate , @xmath12 where the strain - rate is defined as the derivative of the velocity in the direction of flow ( @xmath13 ) with respect to depth ( @xmath14 ) , @xmath15 .",
    "typically , in local , newtonian , hydrodynamic treatments of granular dynamics @xcite , the relationship @xmath16 is used , combined with the kinetic term @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a viscosity and @xmath19 is the granular temperature ( to be discussed in section [ depth ] ) . since the strain - rate is also proportional to the square root of the granular temperature @xmath20 , eq .",
    "[ chute3_eq1 ] is then recovered .",
    "bagnold s argument , applied to the case of bulk granular flow , is predicated on a constant density depth - profile with no - slip condition at the base .",
    "this leads to a velocity depth - profile of the form , @xmath21 , \\label{chute3_eq2}\\ ] ] for a pile of total height @xmath8 , where @xmath14 is measured from the bottom of the pile . because bagnold scaling comes naturally from dimensional analysis in the absence of intrinsic time scales",
    ", one might expect that most studies would observe this kind of rheology .",
    "however , results depend strongly on the experimental procedure ; profiles of this form have only been reported in a few instances @xcite .",
    "one method to study gravity - driven flows is to construct a wedge - shaped static pile that evolves to produce an inclined surface close to the angle of repose of the material @xcite , fig .",
    "[ chute3_fig1](a ) .",
    "we term these _ heap flows_. here , the inclination of the surface is determined by material properties . to study flow ,",
    "material is supplied via a hopper - feeder mechanism at the high end of the pile and flow is induced at the free surface . in this case , although the flow rate may be varied by changing the discharge rate of the hopper , the system typically flows only in a thin surface layer , indicated by the shaded region in fig .",
    "[ chute3_fig1](a ) , which is of order 10 particles diameters in depth .",
    "in one such experiment , lemieux and durian @xcite observed avalanche behavior for low particle flux , characterized by sporadic downstream movement at the free surface . on increasing the particle flux , a velocity profile with depth",
    "was observed to be approximately exponential in the thin surface layer .",
    "more recently , utilizing a similar experimental geometry , komatsu et al .",
    "@xcite found that the ` stationary ' bulk material beneath the surface flow actually undergoes very slow , ` creeping ' motion with a well - defined exponential velocity profile at longer times .",
    "another method uses inclined planes to study flows and avalanches , typically with rough beds designed to reduce slip at the base , thereby avoiding plug or unstable flow @xcite .",
    "we term these _ chute flows_. roughness is introduced onto the chute by gluing particles to the chute base @xcite , or by attaching a frictional material to the base , such as the velvet cloth used by daerr and douady @xcite .",
    "chute flow studies of two and three dimensional systems with rough bases report depth - averaged velocities with both linear @xcite and non - linear dependence @xcite on height . the geometry for these experiments is shown in fig .",
    "[ chute3_fig1](b ) .",
    "the material is contained in a reservoir at one end of a plane inclined at a variable angle @xmath0 with respect to the horizontal .",
    "after the gate to the reservoir is opened , material flows down the incline .",
    "steady flow occurs only at high enough angle ; while flows come to rest quickly on the rough bed for small inclination angles  @xcite . increasing the gate opening leads to thicker flows down the incline :",
    "there are no dead zones along the incline and all the material flows down the chute .",
    "this allows one to independently control the inclination angle and material flux of the pile , in contrast to the heap experiments .    using a range of inclination angles and flow depths ,",
    "pouliquen @xcite measured the depth - averaged flow velocity of material for piles of different thickness .",
    "the velocity in the direction of flow scaled with height of the pile as @xmath22 , which has a different form from the heap flow results reported by lemieux and durian @xcite and azanza et al .",
    "however , ancey s comprehensive experimental investigation @xcite demonstrated that during the course of one experiment , a range of flow behaviors is obtained that depends , among other parameters , on the flow rate of the material .",
    "ancey s results suggest that the different flow profiles observed are not necessarily in contradiction , but may be a consequence of the conditions under which the measurements are made .    in our earlier studies",
    "@xcite , we simulated the rheology of dense , cohesionless , frictional spheres in inclined plane geometries .",
    "employing periodic boundary conditions in the flow and vorticity directions , our simulations can be considered equivalent to the experimental set up in fig .",
    "[ chute3_fig1](b ) , for an infinitely long chute far away from the material reservoir and side walls , with a continuous supply of material .",
    "our previous study was concerned with the flow of thick piles on rough bases over a range of tilt angles where we found bagnold scaling in stable steady flow , for a range of parameters ( e.g. particle friction and inelasticity , and inclination angles ) .    to investigate the discrepancies between the various experimental results previously mentioned ,",
    "we have extended our previous computational studies of granular chute flows to cover a wide range of pile thickness , from very thin to very thick piles , both near and far from the angle of repose @xmath1 .",
    "we show here that even thick piles experience a crossover in behavior from bagnold rheology to linear velocity profiles , and also avalanche - like flow near the angle of repose .",
    "we therefore refine our definition of stable , steady state flow : we report on three distinct steady state flows observed in our simulations which match the experimentally observed flows reported by lemieux and durian @xcite ( avalanches ) , ancey @xcite ( linear velocity profiles ) , and pouliquen @xcite ( bagnold scaling ) .",
    "our main conclusion is that the observed behavior is strongly dependent on how close the system is to jamming or how close @xmath0 is to @xmath1 .    in the next section",
    "we briefly describe the simulation procedure . in section [ chute3_results ]",
    "we present the results of our simulations , in particular defining the phase space of our study and describing transitions between the flow properties of thick and thin piles both near and far from the angle of repose .",
    "we also present results for our analyses on the initiation and cessation of flow in section [ chute3_initiate ] . in section [ chute3_conc ]",
    "we summarize the main conclusions of this work .",
    "here we briefly introduce the simulation model ; a thorough description of the technique is available elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we model @xmath23 cohesionless , frictional , and inelastic spheres of diameter @xmath24 and mass @xmath25 flowing on a fixed , rough bed of area @xmath26 with a free top surface .",
    "although most of our results are for monodisperse systems , we have verified that our results hold for systems with small polydispersity @xcite .",
    "we employed a 3d contact force model that captures the major features of granular particles : interactions between spheres are modeled as hertzian contacts with _",
    "static friction_. the implementation of the contact forces , both the normal forces and the shear ( friction ) tangential forces , is essentially a reduced version of that employed by walton and braun @xcite , developed earlier by cundall and strack @xcite .",
    "normal and tangential forces acting on particle @xmath27 due to contact with particle @xmath28 are given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the particle - particle overlap , @xmath31 , is the unit normal along the line of centers , for particle @xmath27 situated at @xmath32 and @xmath28 at @xmath33 .",

    "@xmath36 is the effective mass and @xmath37 and @xmath38 are elastic and viscoelastic constants respectively .",
    "thus in a gravitational field * g * , the force on particle @xmath27 arises from newton s second law for the translational and rotational degrees of freedom , @xmath39 and the force on particle @xmath28 is determined from newton s third law .    as shown in fig .",

    "this suggests the existence of an intrinsic length scale in granular flows and forms part of our work in progress .    for thick enough piles flowing on a rough inclined plane ,",
    "say @xmath148 , the velocity profiles and rheology follow bagnold scaling . as one reduces the height of the flowing pile , a continuous transition from bagnold rheology to linear velocity profiles through to avalanche - like dynamics occurs , until finally , one reaches the angle of repose @xmath1 , and flow ceases . as a result",
    ", one can obtain various velocity profiles and flow behaviors not only through changing the height of the flowing pile , but also by varying the inclination angle of the chute , such that there is an overlap region where one can obtain similar flow properties through either procedure .",
    "these features can be used in surface flow treatments @xcite to better predict the evolution of an avalanche surface .    our investigation on the initiation and cessation of flow shows that the initiation process starts from failure at the base that results in a `` heat '' front that propagates up the pile .",
    "upon cessation of flow , an effective freezing front propagates up the pile with particles becoming trapped in the frozen layer until the whole system comes to rest .",
    "in some cases , flow initiation or cessation only occurred after many time units ( approximately equivalent to 20 seconds for a 1 mm sized particle ) .",
