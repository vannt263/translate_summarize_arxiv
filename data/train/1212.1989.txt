    "this article is the second part of ref . [ ] , where it was shown that according the most general parisi - sourlas stochastic quantization procedure , @xcite any ( stochastic ) continuous - time dynamical system ( ds ) can be looked upon as a witten - type or cohomological tft .",
    "@xcite previous paper was mainly concerned with the explanation of the ubiquitous emergence of the long - range correlations in various ds s known generically as complex dynamics .",

    "[ tfttods ] . in secs.[wittenvspartfunction ] and [ physpart ] , it is shown that the physical meaning of the witten index is the partition function of the stochastic noise up to a topological constant , and that the physical partition function of the tft is the partition function of the ds .",
    "it is also shown that the stochastic expectation values must be defined through the physical partition function of tft . in sec .",
    "[ goldstone ] , the goldstone theorem and the corresponding emergence of the long - range correlations are addressed . in sec.[conditionprobabilities ] , the tft s wavefunctions are identified as the conditional probability densities of the ds .",
    "this identification establishes an interesting connection with the probability theory and provides yet another physical meaning of the phenomenon of the spontaneous topological symmetry breaking . in sec.[physqsym ] , the physical meaning of the topological symmetry itself is revisited from the point of view of the novel interpretation of the tft s wavefunctions .",
    "[ conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "the forthcoming discussion can be generalized to the cases of non - gaussian and colored noises , step - like temporal evolution , infinite - dimensional phase spaces ( _ i.e. _ , higher - dimensional field theories ) etc .",
    "not to digress on unnecessary details , we will concentrate on the simplest tft - the topological quantum mechanics ( tqm ) @xcite on a finite - dimensional phase space , @xmath2 .",
    "tqm is the result of the stochastic quantization of the following stochastic differential equation ( sde ) : @xmath3 here @xmath4 are the system s variables , @xmath5 is the so - called flow vector field , and @xmath6 s is the stochastic gaussian white noise : @xmath7 the double - arrowed notation for expectation values is standard in the theory of pseudo - hermitian models , @xcite that the models under consideration will turn out to be .",
    "allow us to accept this notation from the very beginning . in eq.([noise ] ) , @xmath8 has the meaning of the noise - induced metric on @xmath2 .",
    "by introducing veilbeins as @xmath9 we can decouple the noise from the system s variables : @xmath10 the partition function of the decoupled noise is : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the normalization constant that , in particular , carries the burden of the numerical consistency of integrals over infinite - dimensional spaces , such as the space of all the possible configurations of noise , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the space of all maps from the time - circle , @xmath15 , into the tangent space of @xmath2 , @xmath16 with @xmath17 . by thinking that the time belongs to a circle we assume periodic boundary conditions , corresponding to the case of equilibrium dynamics .",

    "eq.([pathintegral0 ] ) can be represented as : @xmath34 where the fokker - planck hamiltonian functional is given as @xmath35 , with @xmath36 from eq.([qbar ] ) . in the schrdinger picture , from eq.([schrodinger ] ) the fundamental bi - graded commutation relations , @xmath37_- = [ i\\hat { \\bar\\chi}_i,\\hat \\chi^j]_+ = \\delta^i_j$ ] , suggests @xmath38 in the representation where @xmath39 s and @xmath40 s are diagonal .",

    "the sign must be chosen in such a manner that the rules of the bi - graded commutation relations of the nther charge of @xmath44-symmetry with the operator representations of all the fields , @xmath45 , ( eq.([commutation ] ) below ) comply with the original action of @xmath44 in eq.([brst ] ) .",
    "the sign chosen satisfies this requirement .",
    "wavefunctions are functions of @xmath39 s and @xmath40 s only . any wavefunction can be taylor expanded in the ghosts : @xmath46 due to the anticommutation composition for the ghosts , tensors @xmath47 are antisymmetric . following witten ,",
    "@xcite we notice that the operator algebra of the theory is identical to that of the algebraic topology on @xmath2 : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the wedge product and @xmath50 is the interior multiplication .",
    "therefore , the hilbert space , @xmath51 , can be identified as the exterior algebra of @xmath2 and the wavefunctions are the forms from @xmath51 : @xmath52 using the standard technique , one finds that the nther charge associated with the @xmath44-symmetry is @xmath53 , which in the schrdinger picture becomes the exterior derivative : @xmath54 notation , @xmath55 , is common for the tft literature , while @xmath56 is the established notation in the algebraic topology .",

    "this is to notice that the rules for the @xmath44-differentiation in eq([brst ] ) are formally the same as those for the bi - graded commutation with @xmath56 : @xmath60 = ( \\hat \\chi^i,0,\\hat b_i,0).\\label{commutation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , the @xmath61-exact hamiltonian , @xmath62 , becomes in the schrdinger picture a @xmath56-exact operator : @xmath63 = -\\triangle/2-\\mathcal{l}_a,\\label{fphamiltonian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the symmetrized version of @xmath65 : @xmath66 with @xmath67 being the interior multiplication by @xmath68 so that @xmath69 $ ] is lie derivative along the flow , and with @xmath70 , being the adjoint of the exterior derivative defined through the covariant derivative @xmath71 , so that @xmath72 $ ] is the weitzenbck laplacian .",

    "each cohomology class of @xmath2 may provide only one state that does not break @xmath44-symmetry .",
    "indeed , if there are two states with zero eigenvalue within the same cohomology class , then their difference is an exact eigenstate , which also has zero - eigenvalue .",

    "the point is that each @xmath123 uniquely defines the configuration of the noise that makes this @xmath124 the solution of the sde : @xmath125 where @xmath126 from eq.([sde ] ) .",

    "the noise s partition function does not depend on the flow and the metric on @xmath2 , and consequently on whether the ground states are @xmath44-symmetric or not .",

    "this can be seen in the simplest model - the 1d langevin sde with the harmonic potential with the interlevel separation @xmath146 . for this model , @xmath147 , while @xmath148 , which follows from the fact that in this linear model any noise s configuration corresponds only to one solution of sde .",
    "it is the trace of the evolution operator , _",

    "the normalized stochastic expectation value ( sev ) is : @xmath150 where @xmath151 is an observable .",

    "only the ground states contribute into eq.([average2 ] ) , and the sev becomes the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) : @xmath153 where @xmath154 runs only over the ground states , @xmath149 equals ( up to an oscillating factor ) the number of the ground states , and the pathintegral is assumed over the trajectories that connect the arguments of @xmath155 s and @xmath156 s at positive and negative temporal infinities .    to understand which eigenstates are the ground states , allow us to briefly recall the spectrum of the model discussed previously in ref .",
    "[ ] . from straightforward physical arguments ,",
    "the real part of all eigenvalues , @xmath157 , is non - negative , @xmath158 .",
    "eigenstates with @xmath159 are dissipative and for this reason are not physical .",
    "these states will drop out from the partition function in the physical @xmath152 limit .",
    "only the non - dissipative states with @xmath160 will survive the fp evolution and for this reason can be considered the physical states .",
    "allow us to denote the physical part of the hilbert space by @xmath161 .",
    "the @xmath44-symmetric states , @xmath85 s , with zero - eigenvalues certainly belong to @xmath162 .",
    "if there are no other physical states in @xmath163 , then @xmath44-symmetry is not broken and all the @xmath85 s are the ground states of the model .",
    "if , however , @xmath162 also contains physical non - dissipative ruelle - pollicott resonances ( eigenstates with purely imaginary eigenvalues , @xmath164 ) then @xmath44-symmetry is broken . in this case , the ground states are the bosonic - fermionic pair of the ruelle - pollicott resonance with the smallest ( negative ) `` energy '' , @xmath165 .",
    "this can be seen by wick - rotating time `` a little '' , @xmath166 , which will eliminate all the physical states from the partition function except for these ground states .      using eq.([average ] )",
    ", we can now prove the goldstone theorem that ensures that ds s with spontaneously broken @xmath44-symmetry must exhibit long - range correlations .",
    "for simplicity , we assume that there is no accidental degeneracy in the ground states so that there are only two ground states that according to eq.([pairofstates ] ) can be represented as @xmath167 and @xmath168 , and @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "there exist a local @xmath44-exact observable , @xmath171 , ( _ e.g. _ , the hamiltonian @xmath172 ) such that its vev is non - zero : @xmath173 here we used that @xmath174 and that we can move operator @xmath56 through the @xmath84-exact expression between the bra and ket of the ground states , so that the contributions from the two ground states are the same . for the same reason , the expectation value of any @xmath44-exact operator within the witten index is always zero , even when @xmath44-symmetry is broken . therefore , the realization of the fact that it is the partition function of the tft that must be used for the evaluation of vev s is important , in particular , for the proof of the goldstone theorem .",

    "the vev in eq.([average2 ] ) should not be changed because the @xmath44-rotation is only a change in the variables of integration . leaving only the terms linear in @xmath185 we arrive at @xmath186 with @xmath187 from eq.([average1 ] ) .",
    "one of the terms in the lhs , the one with @xmath188 acting on the @xmath56-exact ket earlier than @xmath189 , vanishes because of the nilpotency of @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , @xmath190 in other words , the correlation between @xmath191 and @xmath189 is infinitely long because @xmath192 is arbitrary large .",
    "we can as well chose @xmath193 , with @xmath194 being yet another small constant .",

    "operator @xmath197 , in turn , has as its part the momentum operator , @xmath198 , which is the quantum counterpart of the classical concept of velocity .    in the deterministic limit , this infinitely long , perturbation - induced `` shift '' in velocity will be gradually accumulated in the trajectory of the ds as time goes on . even for @xmath199 , at sufficiently large @xmath200 the trajectory must become very different from the one that the ds would have developed if unperturbed",
    "this is most likely the tft s way of encoding the concept of high sensitivity to initial conditions in chaotic deterministic ds s .    in the general , stochastic case",

    "in such situation , both the marginal and conditional probability densities must be non - trivial in the de rahm cohomology of @xmath2 ( must be @xmath56-closed but not @xmath56-exact ) , otherwise @xmath225 ( for a compact @xmath2 with no boundary ) . in conventional notations of the algebraic topology , @xmath226\\in h^n$ ] , @xmath227\\in h^{d - n}$ ] , where @xmath228 s are the cohomologies of the corresponding degree .",
    "in this case , eq.([defcpd ] ) is a realization of the de rahm cohomology ring .",
    "the interpretation of cpd s as of forms suggests that information theory and , _",
    "e.g. _ , intersection theory must be synergetic .",
    "this line of thinking could probably be called `` information topology '' by analogy with `` information geometry '' .",
    "we can now make an attempt to defend the idea that cpd s are the ds theory counterparts of the tft s wavefunctions .",
    "one of the arguments comes from the shape of the kets of the @xmath44-symmetric states , @xmath85 s , in the deterministic limit .",
    "those are the poincre duals of the unstable manifolds as was discussed briefly in the end of sec .",
    "[ general ] and , in more details , in ref .",
    "if so , the unstable manifolds can be thought to parameterize the `` known '' variables , while the `` stable '' directions , in which the kets have ghosts , are the delta - function - like cpd s just as it should be .",
    "there is yet another argument that points on the cpd s interpretation of the tft s wavefunctions .",
    "this argument applies also for to stochastic ds s .",
    "the argument is the similarity between the definition of the cpd in eqs.([marginalcondition ] ) and eq.([defcpd ] ) , and the hilbert space structure discussed in sec . [ general ] . from eqs.([unity ] ) and/or ( [ pairofstates ] ) , it is seen that for any non-@xmath44-symmetric eigenstate either bra or ket satisfy eq.([marginalcondition ] ) .",
    "the bras and kets , in turn , are `` formed '' by backward and forward temporal evolution and for this reason contain unstable and stable variables respectively .",
    "this means that the bras and kets have the meaning of pairs of marginal and conditional probability densities for the unstable and stable variables . for each non-@xmath44-symmetric state either bra or ket",
    "does not satisfy eq.([marginalcondition ] ) , suggesting that the unstable and stable variables are not dynamically independent . in contrary , for a @xmath44-symmetric state , @xmath85 , both bra and ket satisfy eq.([marginalcondition ] ) .",
    "it can be said that the unstable and stable variables are dynamically independent .    from the above discussion the following interpretation of the spontaneous @xmath44-symmetry breaking follows - for the ds s with broken @xmath44-symmetry , the unstable and stable variables are not dynamically independent in the ground state(s ) .",
    "as a closing remark , allow us to repeat the argument from ref .",
    "[ ] , that the @xmath44-symmetry is actually a necessity for the `` extended '' description of a ds , in terms of not only the total probability densities but also in terms of cpd s .",
    "consider the stokes theorem : @xmath229 where @xmath210 is some n - chain with boundary @xmath230 .",
    "this expression must hold for all times , while both @xmath231 and @xmath232 evolve according to the generalized fp equation .",
    "therefore @xmath233 which shows that the generalized fp hamiltonian is commutative with @xmath56 . on the other hand ,",
    "we known that @xmath56 is the nther charge of @xmath44-symmetry .",
    "in other words , the theory with the extended description must possess @xmath44-symmetry , _ i.e. _ , it must be a tft .",
    "in this paper , which is a continuation of the study of the relation between witten - type topological field theories and dynamical systems theory , @xcite it was shown that on the ds theory side , the witten index represents up a topological factor the partition function of the stochastic noise , while the physical partition function of the tft is that of the ds .",
    "also , it was shown that the wavefunctions of tft must be interpreted as the conditional probability densities of the corresponding ds .    to our opinion ,",
    "the story of the relation between tft s and the ds s is reasonably reliable at this stage . at the same time , there are many questions that still need to be answered .",
    "one of them is the interpretation of observations / measurements . in other words ,",
    "what does an observation do to a wavefunction ? does it automatically project the wavefunction onto the corresponding conditional probability density sector ( ghost sector ) because we learned values of some variables ? if yes , how far is this projection from the concept of wavefunction collapse in quantum mechanics or from the bayesian update of probability density ? other important questions are how to identify @xmath44-order parameters , what is their physical meaning , and what is their low - energy effective actions . answering these questions",
    "will allow for the construction of effective theories of various complex ds s - probably one of the most important possible applications of the tft of ds .",
