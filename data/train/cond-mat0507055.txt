    "the origin of life is one of the most important unsolved problems in science@xcite . to answer the quest ,",
    "the self - organization of matter@xcite and the emergence of order@xcite have been regarded as the key ideas . to investigate such ideas , as early as in 1969",
    "kauffman has introduced the so - called _ @xmath2 kauffman model _  a random boolean network model based upon the random network theory@xcite .",
    "this model has been a prototype model and studied by many authors for a long time in understanding complex systems such as metabolic stability and epigenesis , genetic regulatory networks , and transcriptional networks@xcite as well as general boolean networks@xcite , neural networks@xcite and spin glasses@xcite .    at nearly the end of 1990 s new kinds of networks , called scale - free networks ,",
    "have been discovered from studying the growth of the internet geometry and topology@xcite .",
    "after the discovery , scientists have known that many systems such as those which were originally studied by kauffman as well as other various systems such as internet topology , human sexual relationship , scientific collaboration , economical network , etc .",
    "belong to the category of the scale - free networks .",
    "therefore , it is very interesting for us to know what will happen when we apply the concepts of scale - free networks to the kauffman s boolean network models .",
    "recently , there have just started some studies in this direction @xcite .",
    "there , the boolean dynamics of the kauffman model with a scale - free network has been intensively studied .",
    "we would like to shortly call this the scale - free ( @xmath3 ) kauffman model .",
    "hence , there are many interesting problems that are necessary to be considered .",
    "thus , in this paper we would like to study the structure of rugged fitness landscapes of the @xmath3 kauffman model .",
    "we would like to know what is the difference in fitness landscapes between the @xmath2 and the @xmath3 kauffman models .",
    "the organization of the paper is the following : in sec.ii , we summarize the formalism on boolean dynamics of the @xmath2 kauffman model . in sec.iii",
    ", we introduce the formalism to calculate the statistics and the rugged fitness landscapes of @xmath2 kauffman model . and",
    "our scheme to obtain a scale - free network is given .",
    "in sec.iv , we show the numerical results of the rugged fitness landscapes , of the histograms and its tails , and of the correlation between the fitness of local optima and their hamming distance from the highest optimum found , for both quenched @xmath2 and @xmath3 models , respectively . in sec.v",
    ", our conclusion will be given .",
    "in the @xmath2 model ( the @xmath3 model is described below ) , we assume that the total number of nodes ( vertices ) @xmath4 and the degree ( i.e. , the number of inputs ) of the @xmath5-th node @xmath6 in the network are fixed such that all @xmath7 . therefore , the resultant graph is a _ directed _ random network , where each link has its own direction as represented by an arrow on the link .",
    "this gives us in general an _ asymmetric _ adjacency matrix of network theory .",
    "since there are @xmath8 inputs to each node , @xmath9 boolean spin configurations can be defined on each node ; the number @xmath9 certainly becomes very large as @xmath8 becomes a large number .",
    "we then assume that boolean functions are randomly chosen on each node from the @xmath10 possibilities .",
    "locally this can be represented by @xmath11 for @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the binary state and @xmath14 is a boolean function at the @xmath5th node , randomly chosen from @xmath15 boolean functions with the probability @xmath16 ( or @xmath17 ) to take 1 ( or 0 ) .",
    "if we fixed the set of the randomly chosen boolean functions @xmath18 in the course of the time development , then this model is called the _ quenched model_@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if we change the set each time , then this model is called the _ annealed model _",
    "@xcite . if we study the dynamics of the states in the system taking care of eq.(1 ) , then we are able to obtain the cyclic structures of the states such as the length of the cycle , the transient time and the basin sizes , etc .",
    "these are usually calculated numerically , since it is extremely difficult to do the calculations analytically@xcite .",
    "however , in the annealed models@xcite , it has been investigated analytically that as the degree of nodes @xmath8 is increasing , there exists a kind of _ phase transition of network _ at the critical degree @xmath19 $ ] and if we conversely solve it for @xmath16 then we obtain the critical probability @xmath20 .",
    "let us now study _ statistics _ in the structure of the fitness landscapes of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 kauffman models .",
    "the fitness landscapes are calculated as follows@xcite : ( i ) generate a network with @xmath4 nodes and the degree @xmath6 of the @xmath5-th node .",
    "the @xmath6 links are inputs that are directed to the @xmath5-th node .",
    "( ii ) define the local fitness at the @xmath5-th node by @xmath21 for @xmath12 , where @xmath22 takes one of @xmath23 real numbers @xmath24 which are randomly taken from the interval @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "this provides us a table for each node ( table.1 ) .",
    "( iii ) define an @xmath4-component initial state @xmath26 , say @xmath27 .",
    "( iv ) investigate the input states on @xmath6 links for the @xmath5-th node . and adjusting the states in the entries with the table , choose the fitness @xmath22 from the @xmath23 values of @xmath28 .",
    "then , define the fitness @xmath29 for the state @xmath26 by @xmath30 ( v ) each state forms a vertex of the @xmath4-dimensional hypercube so that there are totally @xmath31 vertices , each of which has its @xmath4 neighbors such as @xmath32 ( i.e. , one - mutant variants , denoted by @xmath33 ) .",
    "then , calculate the fitnesses @xmath34 for these neighbor states in the same way . ( vi )",
    "compare the fitness value @xmath29 of the @xmath26 state with those of the neighbor states such as @xmath34 , successively . here",
    "the hamming distances between the state and its neighbors are all @xmath35 . if @xmath36 for all neighbors @xmath37 s , then the fitness @xmath29 for the @xmath26 state is a local optimum . and if we meet a neighbor @xmath37 such that @xmath38 , then write @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "redo the same procedure with all neighbors to obtain @xmath41 , @xmath42 , etc . until the local optimum is found .",
    "( vii ) finally , measure the difference between each fitness of the neighbors and the local optimum fitness .",
    "this provides us a rugged fitness landscape of the system .",
    "the above procedure starts from the particular initial state with the set of the random numbers @xmath22 .",
    "since we can change either the initial state to a different state in the @xmath31 states or the set to a different set chosen randomly , we can generate many samples .",
    "each sample results in a different rugged fitness landscape of the system .",
    "hence , we obtain an ensemble of them .",
    "thus we can study the statistics of the structures of rugged fitness landscapes@xcite . in this paper",
    "we take a thousand samples for the purpose . +    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +   + table 1 .",
    "the relationship between the ( real ) output @xmath22 and the ( binary ) inputs , @xmath43 . since there are ( @xmath44 ) @xmath45 s , each of which has @xmath46 or @xmath35 , there are @xmath23 ways of inputs .",
    "these provide @xmath23@xmath47 s , each of which is a real number randomly drawn from the interval @xmath48 $ ] , according to a homogeneous distribution +     and of the quenched @xmath3 kauffman models , where the total number of nodes is given by @xmath49 .",
    "( a)(d ) are shown for the random networks of @xmath50 , respectively , and ( e)(h ) for the scale - free networks of @xmath51 , respectively , where @xmath0 means the average degree of nodes .",
    "in each figure , the vertical axis shows the fitness while the horizontal axis shows the family of all one - mutant variants @xmath33 of a local optimum .",
    "the dotted line denotes the fitness level of the local optimum and the curve the fitness differences between the local optimum and all the one - mutant variants . ]    to apply the above method to the @xmath3 kauffman model , we have to specify a model for the scale - free network with an arbitrary degree of nodes @xmath52 , even integer . for this purpose ,",
    "let us adopt a slightly modified version of the so - called albert - barabsi ( ab ) model@xcite as a prototype model . in our model",
    ", we initially start with @xmath53 nodes for seeds of the system , all of which are linked to each other such that the total link number is @xmath54 . and",
    "every time when we add one node to the system , @xmath55 new links are randomly chosen in the previously existing network , according to the preferential attachment probability of @xmath56 . then , after @xmath57 steps , we obtain the total numbers of nodes @xmath58 and of links @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "we continue this process until the system size @xmath4 is achieved .",
    "hence , by this we can define @xmath60 as @xmath61 .",
    "the generalization can be straightforward .",
    "now we apply the above - mentioned dynamics to this modified ab model and call the result the @xmath3 kauffmann model @xcite .",
    "when a particular value of the fitness difference @xmath62 between a local optimum and @xmath33 occurs in the rugged fitness landscapes . here",
    "the quenched models have been adopted .",
    "( c ) and ( d ) [ ( a ) and ( b ) ] show the histograms and the tails for the scale - free [ random ] networks of @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) , @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) , @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) , respectively , where @xmath69 .",
    "here @xmath0 stands for the average degree of nodes .",
    "the data for 1000 samples are superimposed in each figure .",
    "( b ) and ( d ) ( inset ) are shown in the log - log ( semi - log ) plot of the tails . ]",
    "fig.1 shows the rugged fitness landscapes of both the quenched random @xmath2 and the quenched @xmath3 kauffman models . here",
    "we have calculated the systems up to @xmath49 .",
    "this is just because of our computer power at this moment .",
    "we only show the data for @xmath49 in this paper .",
    "as previously noted by kauffman@xcite the fitness landscapes of the random networks are very rugged .",
    "we see that the fitness landscapes of scale - free networks are very rugged as well , but quite different from those of the random networks .",
    "this can be understood as follows : in the random network each one of the nodes always meets with the same @xmath8 links to the neighbors .",
    "the ruggedness can be dominantly bounded by the value of @xmath8 .",
    "hence , as @xmath8 becomes large , the fluctuations in the rugged fitness landscapes become large . on the other hand , in the scale - free network",
    "there are various kinds of degrees @xmath6 of nodes . in other words ,",
    "each node has its own @xmath6 links and there is the distribution of the degrees such as @xmath70 .",
    "the ab model exhibits power - law with @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , the fitness landscapes can fluctuate , according to the degree distribution of the network .",
    "so , as the degree @xmath6 of a node is large , the difference in the fitness between the optimum and the mutants is expected to be large .",
    "hence , the fitness landscapes obey the nature of the scale - free network .",
    "how can we detect the differences in the rugged fitness landscapes between the random and the scale - free networks ?",
    "to do so , denote by @xmath72 the histogram and denote by @xmath62 the fitness difference between the local optimum and the one - mutant variant .",
    "then we draw the histograms of the rugged fitness landscapes in the normal plot [ ( a ) and ( c ) ] , in the log - log plot [ ( b ) and ( d ) ] , and in the semi - log plot ( insets ) , respectively ( fig.2 ) . comparing ( a ) with ( c ) in the numerical results ,",
    "we find that the histograms of the fitness landscapes for the random networks behave like gaussian distributions , which can be fitted by @xmath73 where we set the peak value as @xmath74 , the variance as @xmath75 with @xmath76 .",
    "we have found numerically that @xmath77 ; @xmath78 for @xmath79 , respectively . on the other hand , the histograms for",
    "the scale - free networks behave like non - gaussian distributions with a broad tail , which can be fitted by @xmath80 here we have found numerically that @xmath81 ; @xmath82 ; @xmath83 ; @xmath84 , for @xmath85 , respectively .",
    "we note here the following : ( a ) the tail ( i.e. , scaling behavior ) appears when the system size becomes as large as @xmath49 . and as the value of @xmath0 is increasing , the value of @xmath86 seems closer to @xmath71 of @xmath87 in the ab model@xcite [ fig.2 ( d ) ] .",
    "but in view of the limited accuracy of fig .",
    "2(d ) ( e.g. , @xmath88 ) , at the present moment this can be a _ conjecture _ , speculated from the numerical results for the system of @xmath49 .",
    "however , in appendix a we give a sharp analytical arguments showing a strict relationship between the power - law decay and the `` degree '' fluctuations . and also , since we extend the system up to @xmath89 , we are able to confirm ourselves that the tail behavior is maintained and become more prominent , as @xmath4 is increasing . as an example",
    ", we show the result in appendix b.    \\(b ) the results for the random networks show a kind of _ transition _ when the value of @xmath8 is going up from @xmath90 to @xmath91 .",
    "this is consistent with the critical value of @xmath92 for @xmath93 which was analytically obtained from the annealed model@xcite .",
    "therefore , the distribution below @xmath94 is quite different from that above @xmath94 so that the distributions for @xmath95 become more gaussian - like as @xmath8 increases . very interestingly ,",
    "we find a similar transition for the scale - free networks as well , when the value of @xmath0 is going up from @xmath96 to @xmath97 .    this can be explained as follows",
    ": suppose the distribution of degrees is approximately given by @xmath98 such that we can impose normalization @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the riemann s zeta function defined by @xmath101 .",
    "substituting it to the definition @xmath102 , then we obtain @xmath103 which is finite for @xmath104 and infinite for @xmath105 and which was first obtained by aldana et .",
    "for example , since @xmath71 for the special case of the ab model , we obtain @xmath106 . as studied by aldana et .",
    "al.@xcite , the critical value @xmath107 for the annealed dynamics of the @xmath3 kauffman model is given by @xmath108 for @xmath93 as well , where @xmath109 .",
    "within the limited accuracy of our numerical results ( some 20 percent ) this is the same value as just stated for the quenched dynamics .",
    "in fact , we expect that also for our quenched dynamics there is a critical point around @xmath110 , with @xmath86 around 3 , maybe again exactly at these values .",
    "in fact , in appendix a we show that also in our case the statistics of the rugged fitness landscape is bounded by @xmath8 , such that @xmath86 reflects the fluctuations of the degree , which should be the same both for the quenched and the annealed dynamics @xcite . thus",
    ", our numerical results support this analytical result although our system is not very large but a finite scale - free network of @xmath49 .",
    "we also note here that we confirm that the phase transition at the critical value of @xmath1 , which was proved analytically in the annealed model by aldana _ et.al . _",
    "@xcite , occurs in the quenched model as well @xcite .",
    "( a ) , @xmath65 ( b ) , @xmath67 ( c ) and for the scale - free networks with @xmath96 ( d ) , @xmath65 ( e ) , @xmath67 ( f ) , respectively , where @xmath49 .",
    "the vertical axis stands for the fitness and the horizontal axis the hamming distances between the largest local optimum and the local optima .",
    "the data for 1000 samples are superimposed in each figure . in both cases there",
    "seem to exist phase transitions , i.e. , at @xmath111 for the random networks and @xmath1 for the scale - free networks , supporting the exact statement for the annealed version of the first mentioned case and the analytical prediction of aldana et .",
    "al . on the annealed version of the @xmath3 model . ]",
    "finally we present the correlation between the fitness of local optima and their hamming distance from the highest optimum found@xcite ( fig.3 ) . in both the random and the scale - free networks we find the following : if @xmath8 and @xmath0 are as small as the critical value of @xmath112 , then the highest optima are nearest to one another . and the optima at successively greater hamming distances from the highest optimum are successively less fit .",
    "therefore , there is a global order to the landscape . on the other hand , as @xmath8 and @xmath0 increase , the correlations fall away .",
    "this shows that the previous assertions are maintained in the correlations , respectively .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the structure and statistics of the rugged fitness landscapes for the quenched @xmath3 kauffman models , comparing with that for the quenched random @xmath2 kauffman models .",
    "we have numerically calculated the rugged fitness landscapes , the distributions , the tails , and the fitness correlations of local optima with the hamming distance from the highest optimum , respectively . from the results ,",
    "we have concluded that in the @xmath3 kauffman models there is a transition of network when @xmath1 , while in the @xmath2 kauffman models such a transition occurs at @xmath111 .",
    "this is , in some sense , quite analogous to the situation in the study of boolean dynamics of @xmath2 and @xmath3 kauffman models@xcite .",
    "it would be very interesting if we could apply this approach to study fitness landscapes of other network systems .",
    "we would like to thank dr .",
    "jun hidaka for collecting many relevant papers .",
    "one of us ( k. i. ) would like to thank kazuko iguchi for her continuous financial support and encouragement .",
    "the tail behavior of the histogram is interpreted as follows .",
    "define a network with @xmath4 nodes , which can be any kind of network such as random , scale - free and exponential - fluctuating networks , where the @xmath5-th node has @xmath6 degree ( i.e. , link number ) .",
    "let us consider the kauffman model .",
    "as given in table 1 , the number of inputs to the @xmath5-th node is given by @xmath44 .",
    "let us now choose an @xmath4-dimensional initial state @xmath26 such as @xmath113 . considering the input from the given network structure , we can define fitness @xmath22 on each node .",
    "therefore , we can define the fitness @xmath29 of the state @xmath26 by @xmath114 where @xmath115 means fitness at the @xmath116-th node in the state @xmath26 .",
    "consider one - mutant family of the initial state @xmath26 , in which there are @xmath4 neighbor states with hamming distance one .",
    "for example , let us say one of them , @xmath37 and define as @xmath117 . in this example , only the state of node 1 is different from 1 to 0 .",
    "therefore , the difference in input values between the initial state @xmath26 and this state @xmath37 comes from nodes linked to node 1 .",
    "this situation provides a difference in fitness .",
    "suppose that the degree of node 1 is @xmath118 and denote the @xmath118 nodes linked to node 1 by @xmath119 .",
    "the values of nodes linked to node 1 are given different random numbers @xmath120 according to table 1 .",
    "we then obtain fitness for the state @xmath37 as @xmath121 thus , a genetic mutation in the state of one - mutant gives a change only for the node that the mutation occurred and the nodes linked to it .",
    "therefore , if we consider only the fitness difference from the local optimum , then the fitness value of the one - mutant family that has hamming distance 1 from the local optimum state depends upon which node the mutation occurs .",
    "hence , in the case that there is mutation on node @xmath122 , we obtain @xmath123 where @xmath124 .",
    "the left hand side of eq.(a3 ) means the fitness difference , @xmath62 . to see what it means ,",
    "let us define the averaged fitness difference for node @xmath122 : @xmath125 we then have @xmath126 from this , if the average @xmath127 is constant , then @xmath128 is proportional to @xmath129 .",
    "but , more generally , there are two contributions : one from random number @xmath22 in @xmath130 and another from degree @xmath131 . here",
    ", if the random numbers are defined by a uniform distribution , then we can understand that they contribute to the exponent of the fitness distribution function and the tail of the distribution function comes from that of the degree ( link number ) . because , since the maximum value of @xmath22 is 1 , it is bounded as @xmath132 hence , this provides @xmath133 from the above , in the @xmath2 model the statistics of rugged fitness landscapes is bounded by @xmath8 . in the @xmath3 model , since @xmath6 is distributed by a power law , the statistics becomes the same power distribution .",
    "similarly , in the exponential fluctuation distribution , so is the fitness distribution . in this way",
    ", the statistics of fitness is strongly dominated by that of the link distribution in the network .",
    "we show the tail behavior of the histogram in the system size of @xmath134 in fig.4 . this may support our assertion in the text .",
    "we find again @xmath135 ; but since here the power - law decay is already obtained for @xmath136 , we can not exclude that@xmath137 , although such a statement would perhaps only reflect finite - size effects .",
