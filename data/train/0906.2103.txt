    "the standard model of particle physics ( sm ) accounts for cp violation via a single complex parameter in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa @xmath2 quark - mixing matrix  @xcite .",
    "it is possible to write down six triangle relations using the unitarity of the ckm matrix .",
    "one of these , the so - called unitarity triangle , has internal angles @xmath0 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is used by the belle collaboration . ] , and these can be studied using decays of @xmath7 mesons . in these proceedings",
    "i summarize the measurement of @xmath0 , where @xmath8 $ ] , and the @xmath9 are ckm matrix elements for @xmath10 to @xmath11 quark mixing processes .",
    "there are two b - factories in existence , one at the slac national laboratory , usa , and the other at kek , japan .",
    "both are described elsewhere  @xcite , and they collide beams of @xmath12 and @xmath13 with a center of mass ( cm ) energy predominantly corresponding to the @xmath14 resonance . and",
    "belle have accumulated 425 and 771of data at the @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the beam energies are asymmetric , so that the cm is boosted with respect to the laboratory frame of reference .",
    "most of the decay products of the @xmath14 are @xmath7-@xmath15 pairs . by studying combinations of the decays of neutral and charged @xmath7 mesons",
    "to @xmath16 final states , where @xmath17 is a @xmath18 or @xmath19 meson , we can measure @xmath0 .",
    "the first step in this measurement is to isolate signal candidates ( ) . this is done by using two kinematic variables that are computed using the known beam energy in order to reduce resolution effects from experimental reconstruction , and the correlation between these variables .",
    "these are : the difference in reconstructed energy of the @xmath7 candidate and half of the total beam energy in the cm frame of reference ; and @xmath20 which is an effective invariant mass of the @xmath7 candidate computed using the beam energy instead of the reconstructed @xmath7 candidate energy .",
    "signal events peak at zero in the  distribution , and at the @xmath7 mass in @xmath21 @xmath22 .",
    "having identified the  the next step in the measurement involves computing the proper - time difference between the decay of the  and the other @xmath7 in the event ( ) . in order to compute we use the lorentz boost of the cm in the lab frame and the spatial separation between the reconstructed  and  vertices .",
    "it is important to account for the effect of detector resolution on .",
    "this has several sources including the ability to reconstruct the  and  vertices , and the decay in flight of fully or partially reconstructed intermediate particles in the  or .",
    "the final ingredient required for a time - dependent cp measurement is to identify the flavor of the .",
    "this is done using a flavor tagging algorithm that is able to assign a @xmath23 or @xmath24 flavor tag to  at the time it decayed with a probability that depends on the  final state .",
    "the complement of this is called the mistag probability of the event . as the @xmath25 mixing frequency",
    "is well known , we can determine the flavor of the  at the instant it decayed up to a dilution factor related to the mistag probability .",
    "for cp eigenstate decays we construct a cp asymmetry as @xmath26 where @xmath27(@xmath28 ) is the decay - rate for ( ) tagged events , and @xmath29 is the cp eigen - value of the final state .",
    "@xmath30 or @xmath31 are non - zero if the decay is cp violating .    in the case of @xmath32",
    "decays , the interference between @xmath33 mixing and tree amplitudes results in @xmath30 being related to @xmath0 .",
    "however it is not straightforward to interpret the measurement of @xmath30 directly in terms of @xmath0 as there are potential loop ( penguin ) contributions that complicate the issue .",
    "nevertheless it is possible to extract constraints on @xmath0 using @xmath34 isospin or @xmath35 flavor based relations  @xcite .",
    "before the b - factories started to take data the most promising way to measure @xmath0 was thought to be through the study of @xmath36 decays as the @xmath37 state has a large branching fraction , @xmath38 .",
    "the branching fractions of @xmath39 and @xmath40 are required to constrain penguin contributions in this decay .",
    "the branching fraction for @xmath41 is comparable to that for @xmath37 , however the branching fraction of @xmath40 is @xmath42 which turns out to be neither small enough , nor large enough to enable us to strongly constrain penguin pollution in these decays .",
    "we now know that there is a significant penguin contamination in the @xmath37 mode .",
    "nevertheless useful constraints on @xmath0 have been obtained as a result of experimental efforts over the past decade  @xcite .",
    "historically the  and belle measurements of @xmath30 and @xmath31 in @xmath43 have not been in good agreement , however in recent years the compatibility between results has improved .",
    "today the results of the two b - factories are in agreement with each other giving a world average measurement of @xmath44 and @xmath45 . the constraint obtained on @xmath0",
    "is limited by our ability to determine the penguin contribution and the region @xmath46 has been excluded at more than @xmath47 using @xmath48 decays .    the method of measuring @xmath0 using @xmath49 decays is similar to that used for @xmath48 decays .",
    "the main differences are that @xmath50 decays have a smaller signal to background ratio , and the final state is a admixture , where the dominant cp even signal component has to be identified in order to extract time - dependent information related to @xmath0 .",
    "the dominant cp even signal component is extracted from a maximum - likelihood fit that accounts for the presence of longitudinal and transverse components .",
    "the fraction of longitudinally polarized ( even ) signal is close to unity , which simplifies this process .",
    "the precision of the constraint on @xmath0 obtained using @xmath50 decays has changed over time due to the constraints placed on penguin amplitudes .",
    "the initial measurements from benefited from a large measured branching fraction of @xmath51  @xcite .",
    "this branching fraction is crucial for the determination of the penguin contribution .",
    "the result of measuring a large branching fraction for @xmath52 is a 4-fold degenerate solution in @xmath0 with flat isospin triangles . in 2007",
    "the measured branching fraction for @xmath51 was reduced , resulting in a larger error on @xmath0 .",
    "the latest @xmath52 branching fraction measurement has increased the world average , which in turn decreases the penguin pollution , and overall error on alpha  @xcite .",
    "the current constraint is @xmath53 using the gronau - london @xmath34 approach .",
    "this is now in good agreement with the @xmath35 approach from beneke _ et al . _ which gives @xmath54  @xcite .",
    "the difference in central value of these two interpretations comes from neglecting a small correction from electroweak loop contributions in the isospin analysis .",
    "recent searches for @xmath55 have resulted in  seeing evidence for a signal , whereas belle are currently unable to confirm the existence of this channel  @xcite .",
    "the analysis included a time - dependent measurement of @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "it would be possible to reduce the number of ambiguities in the isospin analysis of @xmath50 decays with a precision measurement of @xmath30 and @xmath31 for @xmath56 .",
    "one important set of measurements that has been performed is the constraint on @xmath0 using @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) decays  @xcite .",
    "while the constraint on @xmath0 obtained through these measurements is not as strong as that from @xmath50 decays , it should be noted that a high precision update of this mode will be instrumental in resolving ambiguities inherent in the measurement of @xmath0 .",
    "in addition to the aforementioned decays , there are a number of other decay modes that may provide useful measurements of @xmath0 in the future .",
    "these include @xmath7 meson decays to final states with axial - vector mesons such as @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 .",
    "while it should be possible to start measuring @xmath0 from the some of these modes with the current @xmath7 factories , any precision measurements would be the remit of a super flavor factory .",
    "the utfit  @xcite and ckm fitter  @xcite groups combine information on @xmath0 using different statistical methods .",
    "these groups report average values of @xmath0 using all measurements as @xmath64 , and @xmath65 , respectively .",
    "figure  [ bevan : fig : alpha ] shows the constraint on @xmath0 obtained by utfit on combining direct measurements , where @xmath66 .",
    "the corresponding constraint from ckm fitter is @xmath67 .    in summary",
    "significant progress in the measurement of @xmath0 has been made over the last decade by the slac and kek b - factories .",
    "this provides an important independent crosscheck of the ckm paradigm describing cp violation in the sm .",
    "future experiments such as the proposed super flavor factories , superb in italy and superkekb in japan will provide us with the necessary tools and data to perform precision tests of @xmath0 in individual channels .",
    "any deviations from sm expectation measured could hint at new physics corrections to the ckm paradigm .",
    "the author would like to thank the conference organizers for the opportunity to give this talk , and the scientists working on the slac and kek b - factories for their superlative efforts .",
