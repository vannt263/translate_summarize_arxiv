    "the @xmath1-meson wave function can be defined with two different types of fields .",
    "either we use the @xmath3-quark field , which occurs in the ordinary qcd lagrangian , or the heavy quark field , which occurs in the lagrangian of hqet @xcite . in any case",
    "we get different wave functions , which differ at subleading order in @xmath4 .",
    "if we want to compare a qcd calculation to the corresponding calculation , made in an effective theory like hqet or scet , we need the connection between the qcd and the hqet wave functions . in this paper",
    "i will compute the matching of @xmath2 , the inverse moment of the @xmath1-meson wave function .",
    "this parameter often appears in exclusive @xmath1-decays like @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "usually the lo result only depends on @xmath2 , while the higher logarithmic moments appear first at nlo .",
    "it is then sufficient to know the @xmath4-corrections of the matching coefficient of @xmath2 .",
    "i have tested my result by calculating the nlo of the hard spectator scattering amplitude in @xmath5 in qcd @xcite .",
    "the same calculation has been performed before by @xcite within the framework of scet .",
    "the results agree , if the matching of @xmath2 is properly taken into account .",
    "for the @xmath1-meson wave function i use the definition of @xcite : @xmath7 { \\ifthenelse{\\equal{n}{l } }    {     \\text{$\\not{n}$ }    }    {     \\text{$\\not{\\!n}$ }    } } \\gamma_5 h_v(0)|\\bar{b}\\rangle \\label{l1}\\ ] ] and analogously for the qcd fields @xmath8 { \\ifthenelse{\\equal{n}{l } }    {     \\text{$\\not{n}$ }    }    {     \\text{$\\not{\\!n}$ }    } } \\gamma_5 b(0)|\\bar{b}\\rangle .",
    "\\label{l2}\\ ] ] here @xmath9 is an arbitrary lorentz vector with @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the four - velocity of the @xmath1-meson .",
    "we assume @xmath13 .",
    "the integration in ( [ l1 ] ) and ( [ l2 ] ) goes over @xmath14 .",
    "the path - ordered gauge factor is given by @xmath15=\\text{pexp}[ig_s\\int_0 ^ 1dt\\,z\\cdot a(tz)]$ ] .",
    "we define the @xmath1-meson decay constant by @xmath16 and analogously the hqet decay constant , which depends on the renormalisation scale @xmath17 , by @xmath18 the definition of @xmath2 reads @xmath19 and @xmath20 because @xmath2 usually appears in the combination @xmath21 we define our matching coefficient @xmath22 in the following way : @xmath23",
    "it is obvious that at lo in @xmath4 and in leading power in @xmath24 we get @xmath25 .",
    "we get the nlo correction of @xmath22 by calculating the convolution integrals over @xmath26 in ( [ l5 ] ) and ( [ l6 ] ) up to @xmath27 .",
    "the corresponding diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "[ lbpic1 ] .",
    "because @xmath22 does not depend on the hadronic physics , we use wave functions that are defined by free on - shell quark states , i.e.  we replace @xmath28 in ( [ l1 ] ) and ( [ l2 ] ) by @xmath29 .",
    "we assign to the @xmath3-quark the momentum @xmath30 ( @xmath31 resp . ) in the case of pure qcd ( hqet resp . ) and @xmath32 to the soft constituent quark , where @xmath12 is the four - velocity of the @xmath1-meson .",
    "we assume that @xmath33 and calculate the diagrams only in leading power in @xmath34 .",
    "the diagram in fig .",
    "[ lbpic1](b ) is trivially identical in qcd and hqet , as the heavy quark field does not occur in the loop integral .",
    "it turns out that also fig .",
    "[ lbpic1](c ) does not contribute to ( [ l7 ] ) in leading power .",
    "this is due to the fact that fig .  [",
    "lbpic1](c ) only contributes in leading power in the region where the exchanged gluon is soft . in this region",
    "however qcd and hqet coincide .",
    "we can see this explicitly by writing down this diagram for qcd , which reads up to constant factors : @xmath35 in the region , where @xmath36 is soft , ( [ l7.1 ] ) simplifies to @xmath37 where we used the equation of motion @xmath38 .",
    "( [ l7.2 ] ) is actually the contribution of fig .",
    "[ lbpic1](c ) in hqet .    for the diagram in fig .",
    "[ lbpic1](a ) we obtain in qcd : @xmath39 and in hqet @xmath40 here @xmath41 denotes the lo matrix element , which is the same for qcd and hqet . in ( [ l8 ] ) and ( [ l9 ] ) we have set the dimension to @xmath42 and redefined @xmath43 , which corresponds to the @xmath44-scheme .    the wave function",
    "renormalisation constants of the heavy quark fields are given in the on - shell scheme for the qcd @xmath3-field : @xmath45 and for the hqet field @xmath46 : @xmath47 the renormalisation of the @xmath48-field drops out in the matching .",
    "diagrammatically the matching equation ( [ l7 ] ) reads : @xmath49 finally we obtain @xmath50 where we have renormalised the uv - divergences in the @xmath44-scheme .",
    "the matching coefficient for @xmath51 , which has been calculated in @xcite , @xcite-@xcite , reads : @xmath52 this leads to : @xmath53",
    ". ( [ match12 ] ) allows us to express the dependence of @xmath54 on @xmath17 by the first logarithmic moment . from @xcite",
    "we get : @xmath55 this leads immediately to @xmath56 the @xmath57-term on the right hand side of ( [ match12.1 ] ) has disappeared in ( [ match12.2 ] ) .",
    "this term has been removed by the double logarithm @xmath58 in ( [ match12 ] ) . as already stated in the introduction , i calculated the hard spectator scattering amplitude of @xmath5 in qcd , which has been calculated before in @xcite in the framework of scet . beside the fact that using ( [ match10 ] ) makes our results coincide , it turned out that ( [ match12.2 ] ) leads to the right dependence of the amplitude on @xmath17 .",
    "there are crude approximations of @xmath2 from sum rules @xcite . in order to get an impression of the numerical implications of ( [ match12 ] ) we use the value from @xcite : @xmath59 this leads to the numerical value of @xmath60 : @xmath61 where @xmath4 is defined by four active flavours and @xmath62 .",
    "we see that numerically the value of @xmath60 is slightly enhanced .",
    "however this enhancement is within the error range of ( [ match13 ] ) .    instead of using sum rules @xmath2",
    "might be obtained experimentally from radiative decays @xmath63 .",
    "these decays have been calculated in @xcite at order @xmath4 , where the results are given in terms of @xmath60 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath54 can be obtained by ( [ match12 ] ) .",
