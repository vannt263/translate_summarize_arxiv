    "comparing theoretically calculated and experimentally measured observables of complex atoms provides a crucial step towards a complete understanding of atomic structure .",
    "atomic properties such as excited state lifetimes and branching fractions of energy levels in various atomic species are of special interest because they can be readily measured both in atomic ensembles @xcite and in single atoms @xcite .",
    "knowledge of these atomic properties is especially important for studying spectra of radiation from stars and other galactic objects @xcite .",
    "furthermore , precise measurement of atomic lifetimes and branching fractions can also be used to probe effects of weak interactions such as parity non - conservation of atomic levels @xcite .",
    "precision measurements with trapped ions have benefited from many technological developments in the field of quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "specifically , the lifetimes of the long - lived @xmath8 states @xcite and the branching fractions for the decay of the 4@xmath1p@xmath5 state in calcium ions ( ca@xmath4 ) @xcite and barium ions ( ba@xmath4 ) @xcite have been measured with high precision .",
    "both measurements of the branching fractions use narrow line - width lasers to address the quadrupole transition and perform state readout , making it challenging to apply the method to other atomic species .    in this work , we present a simple method to measure the branching fractions for the decay of the excited states with @xmath9 . due to the simplicity of the experimental setup ,",
    "the method is readily applicable to many atomic species .",
    "we show that many of the systematic uncertainties such as laser light polarization and magnetic field fluctuations can be disregarded .",
    "we apply this method to perform a precision measurement of the branching fractions for the decay of the 4@xmath1p@xmath2 state to the 4@xmath1s@xmath2 and the 3@xmath1d@xmath5 of @xmath3ca@xmath4 .",
    "in this section , we show that the branching fractions for the decay of the excited state can be measured by simply counting the number of photons scattered from the atom .",
    "we consider an atomic energy level scheme where the excited state , @xmath10 , can decay either to a ground state , @xmath11 , or to a long - lived state , @xmath12 , with probabilities of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively ( as shown in figure [ diagram ] for @xmath3ca@xmath4 ) . with laser light addressing the @xmath15 transition present , ( 397 nm for @xmath3ca@xmath4 )",
    ", the atom goes through many scattering events before it eventually ends up in @xmath12 and the scattering stops .",
    "we prove that the mean number of spontaneously emitted photons per atom during this population transfer to @xmath12 only depends on @xmath13 and is given by @xmath16 .",
    "we use optical bloch equations @xcite to treat the interaction of the atom with laser light .",
    "we model the atom as a two - level system consisting of @xmath10 and @xmath11 with an irreversible loss of the excited state population to a long - lived state @xmath12 .",
    "starting from @xmath17 $ ] , where @xmath18 is the density matrix and @xmath19 is the hamiltonian of the system , for each component of the density matrix , @xmath20 , we have    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the rabi frequency associated with the intensity of the laser , @xmath23 is the detuning of the laser and @xmath24 is the decay rate of the excited state .",
    "the mean number of spontaneously emitted photons , @xmath25 , can be calculated from @xmath26 where we substitute in the expression for @xmath27 from eq ( [ eq : rate ] ) and use the boundary value of @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the last photon is emitted from the @xmath10 to @xmath12 transition .",
    "hence , the number of photons spontaneously emitted from @xmath10 to @xmath11 is given by    @xmath30    since @xmath31 does not contain any explicit form of @xmath22 or @xmath23 , it is independent of light intensity and frequency fluctuations .",
    "additionally , any doppler shifts due to the temperature of the atom or its motion ( such as micro - motion in a paul trap or cyclotron motion in a penning trap ) do not affect @xmath31 .",
    "if the excited state has @xmath9 , the photon emission pattern is isotropic as long as the photons are detected regardless of their circular polarizations @xcite .",
    "particularly , the hanle effect will have no influence on photon counting @xcite . as a result , @xmath31 is not sensitive to laser light polarization and the magnetic field . in practice",
    ", a finite magnetic field and linear polarization of the laser light should be used to avoid any optical pumping and coherent population trapping .",
    "such effects can reduce @xmath22 and lead to significant systematic uncertainties due to the finite measurement time of the population transfer .",
    "we measure the branching fractions of the 4@xmath1p@xmath2 level of @xmath3ca@xmath4by performing a series of population transfers .",
    "as shown in the previous section , the branching fraction , @xmath13 can be obtained by counting the the number of photons emitted at 397 nm as the ion is pumped from the 4@xmath1s@xmath2 to the 3@xmath1d@xmath5 state .",
    "the transfer is repeated many times in order to precisely measure the value of @xmath31 and , hence , calculate @xmath13 .",
    "we trap a crystal of 13 ions in a linear paul trap with an inter - electrode distance of 1.0 mm .",
    "( while a larger crystal reduces the measurement time , we choose the number of ions such that the ions remain crystallized throughout the measurement process . )",
    "we apply a radio frequency ( rf ) voltage of 200 @xmath32 with a frequency of 30 mhz to the nearest electrodes .",
    "one pair of the electrodes is driven 180 degrees out of phase with respect to the other pair .",
    "together with 2 v dc applied to each of the end - cap electrodes , we obtain confinement frequencies of 1 mhz and 100 khz in the radial and axial directions , respectively .",
    "the ions are cooled close to the doppler limit with a red - detuned laser at 397 nm and a repumping laser at 866 nm .",
    "both lasers are linearly polarized and pointed at 45 degrees with respect to all the trap axes in order to provide sufficient cooling of all motional modes . in our typical measurement , we apply a magnetic field of 1.0 g along the trap axis to lift the degeneracy of the zeeman sublevels .    the fluorescence from the ions is detected along the axis perpendicular to both the laser and the magnetic field .",
    "we use a photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) with a pair of interference filters ( semrock brightline^^ ff01 - 414/46 - 25 and ff01 - 377/50 - 25 ) to detect photons only at 397 nm .",
    "the filters suppress the fluorescence at 866 nm by at least 100 db .",
    "the detection efficiency for the setup is @xmath33 .",
    "the external - cavity diode lasers at 397 nm and 866 nm are locked to temperature controlled fabry - perot cavities in order to stabilize their frequencies .",
    "we pass the 397 nm laser light through two dispersive prisms ( thorlabs ps850 ) to filter out background spontaneous emission which may excite the ion to the 4@xmath34p@xmath5 state .",
    "this background absorption is reduced to less than one event per 20 minutes for each ion .",
    "both lasers are passed through acousto - optic modulators ( aoms ) in a double - pass configuration . during the pulse sequences ,",
    "the laser light is switched off using a direct digital synthesizer ( dds ) and an rf switch to interrupt the voltage supplied to the aom .",
    "this achieves a light extinction ratio of better than 70 db .",
    "the procedure for measuring the branching fractions is as follows : we start with all the ions in the ground state and turn on the laser light at 397 nm ( pump pulse ) to transfer all ions to @xmath12 .",
    "the number of detected photons during the pump pulse is @xmath35 per ion during where @xmath36 is the detection efficiency .",
    "once the ions are in @xmath12 , applying laser light at 866 nm ( reset pulse ) , brings the ions back to the ground state . during this process",
    ", exactly one blue photon per ion is emitted , so on average , @xmath36 photons per ion are detected . by repeating these transfers @xmath37 times",
    ", we detect @xmath38 blue photons from the pump pulse and detect @xmath39 blue photons during the reset pulse",
    ". then the branching fraction @xmath13 is given by the ratio : @xmath40 which is independent of the detection efficiency @xmath36 .",
    "each measurement iteration consists of a doppler cooling period of 5 ms followed by 50 detection cycles . within each detection cycle ,",
    "the 397 nm light is switched on , first , with low intensity and then with high intensity for 15  @xmath41 each time .",
    "this ensures that the fluorescence count rate is kept low enough in order to minimize counting errors due to the pmt dead time .",
    "after the two 397 nm pulses , all the ions are pumped into @xmath12 .",
    "then , the two pulses are repeated in order to measure the background scatterings of the laser .",
    "finally , a 15  @xmath41-long pulse of 866 nm returns the ions to @xmath11 .",
    "the detected photons are time - tagged and binned , as shown in figure [ pulse ] .",
    "we repeat the measurement for a total of @xmath42 detection cycles .",
    "the total measurement time is @xmath43 10 hours .",
    "we determine the number of photons emitted from the ions during the reset pulse , @xmath44 , by subtracting the background recorded during the time where all lasers are off .",
    "the number of photons emitted from the ions during the 397 nm pump pulses , @xmath45 , is found by taking the differences in the areas between the first two and the last two 397 nm laser pulses .",
    "the statistical error of the measurement is mostly due to photon number fluctuations of @xmath44 . as a result",
    ", we measure the branching fractions for the 4@xmath1p@xmath2 to 4@xmath1s@xmath2 and 3@xmath1d@xmath5 to be @xmath6   and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the main systematic effects for the measurement are the residual birefringence in the detection optics , the dead time of the pmt , the finite lifetime of the 3@xmath34d@xmath5 state , and the light extinction ratio provided by the aoms .",
    "the summary of the measurement uncertainties are presented in table [ table : error ] .",
    ".[table : error ] list of measurement uncertainties . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     for the measurement to be insensitive to laser light polarizations , the detection optics should not distinguish between left and right circular polarizations .",
    "however , a small amount of residual birefringence in the detection path may lead to a varying detection efficiency . in order to experimentally check for this effect , we vary the direction of applied the magnetic field .",
    "we observe no variation in the branching fractions within the statistical uncertainty of the measurement .",
    "the dead time of the pmt leads to undercounting of both @xmath44 and @xmath45 . if the pmt is not saturated , however , it is possible to correct the count rate for this effect .",
    "the uncertainty of this correction is the result of not accurately knowing the dead time .",
    "limiting the maximum count rate with multiple pulses of lower intensity allows one to significantly reduce the correction .    occasionally , the ion is excited off - resonantly to the 4@xmath34p@xmath5 level with the 397 nm laser , which may affect photon counting during the cycles when this excited state decays to the 3@xmath34d@xmath46 state . however",
    ", such events are sufficiently rare and do not affect the measurement results .",
    "the finite measurement duration accounts for the counts not recorded in the tails of the fluorescence peaks .",
    "finally , the finite extinction ratio of the aoms and rf switches accounts for a small residual coupling between the energy levels when the laser lights are switched off .",
    "despite many theoretical calculations of the branching fractions of the excited state of @xmath3ca@xmath4@xcite , the only precise measurement of the branching fractions for the decay of the 4@xmath1p@xmath5 state has been reported in ref .",
    "however , the method is not applicable to the decay from the 4@xmath1p@xmath2 state due to its requirement of three decay channels for the excited state .",
    "the scheme used by kurz _",
    "@xcite in ba@xmath4can be applied to the 4@xmath1p@xmath2 state , but it requires an ultra - fast laser pulse which introduces additional systematic errors and complications in the experimental setup . using the method presented in this work , we provide the first measurement of the branching fractions of the 4@xmath1p@xmath2 decay in ca@xmath4at an uncertainty significantly smaller than the discrepancies between different theoretical calculations , as shown in figure [ theory ] .",
    "since the experimental scheme presented in our work does not require a narrow line - width laser addressing the quadrupole transition , it can be applied readily to perform precision measurement on many atomic species which have excited states with @xmath9 and a suitable long - lived state . in au , both theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite studies on the atomic structure",
    "have been done and used to study the radiation spectrum from stars @xcite . in sc@xmath47and sr@xmath4 , experimental measurements have yet to be done to verify theoretical calculations @xcite .",
    "heavier ions like ba@xmath4 , yb@xmath4and ra@xmath4are especially interesting in precision spectroscopy due to their prospects of observing parity non - conservation effects @xcite , which can be investigated by measuring various branching fractions and lifetimes of different atomic levels .",
    "hg@xmath4 , where no study of the branching fractions have been done , also has a suitable level structure @xcite .",
    "the statistical error in the measurement scheme presented here can be improved by either increasing the photon collection efficiency or the measurement time .",
    "various experimental implementations have been demonstrated to increase photon collection efficiency to at least two orders of magnitude greater than that of our experimental setup @xcite .    in summary",
    ", we present a method for measuring the branching fractions by simple photon counting and apply it to measure the branching fractions for the decay from the 4@xmath1p@xmath2 to the 4@xmath1s@xmath2 and 3@xmath1d@xmath5 states using an ion crystal .",
    "the scheme is shown to be insensitive to light intensity and frequency fluctuations .",
    "the @xmath0 of the excited state provides additional insensitivity to magnetic field amplitude and orientation .",
    "the method can be applied readily to a variety of other atomic species with minimal experimental complication as it only relies on recording time resolved fluorescence and a minimal number of light sources .",
