    "lattice techniques have proved remarkably useful in the quantization of usual gauge theories .",
    "this raised the hope that they may also prove useful in the quantization of gravity .",
    "a major difference however is that most theories of gravity of interest are invariant under diffeomorphisms and the introduction of a discrete structure breaks diffeomorphism invariance .",
    "one of the appealing features of lattice gauge theories is therefore lost in this case , one breaks the symmetry of the theory of interest .",
    "the situation gets further compounded in the case of canonical general relativity , since there one also breaks four dimensional covariance into a @xmath1 dimensional split .",
    "spatial diffeomorphisms get implemented via a constraint that has a natural geometrical action and the usual algebra of diffeomorphisms is implemented via the constraint algebra .",
    "but the remaining space - time diffeomorphism gets implemented through the complicated hamiltonian constraint , that has a challenging algebra with spatial diffeomorphisms .",
    "in particular the algebra of constraints has structure functions . if we call @xmath2 the diffeomorphism constraint smeared by a test vector field ( shift ) @xmath3 and @xmath4 the hamiltonian constraint smeared by a scalar lapse @xmath5 , the constraint algebra is , @xmath6)\\\\ \\left\\{c(\\vec{n}),h(m)\\right\\}=h({\\cal l}_{\\vec{n}}m)\\\\ \\left\\{h({n}),h(m)\\right\\}=c(\\vec{k}(q)),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the vector @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the spatial metric .",
    "the last poisson bracket therefore involves structure functions depending on the canonical variables on the right hand side .",
    "the algebra of constraints poses important complications in the context of loop quantum gravity when one wishes to implement it as an operator algebra at a quantum level ( see @xcite for a lengthier discussion ) .",
    "in particular , if one chooses spin network states with the usual ashtekar - lewandowski @xcite measure , they form a non - separable hilbert space . in it , diffeomorphisms are not implemented in a weakly continuous fashion , i.e. finite diffeomorphisms can be represented but infinitesimal ones can not .",
    "this implies that in loop quantum gravity one treats very asymetrically the spatial and temporal diffeomorphisms .",
    "whereas invariance under spatial diffeomorphisms is implemented via a group averaging procedure @xcite , invariance under the remaining space - time diffeomorphisms is to be implemented by solving a quantum operatorial equation corresponding to the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "since the poisson bracket of two hamiltonian constraints involves the infinitesimal generator of diffeomorphisms , which is not well defined as a quantum operator , one can not expect to implement the poisson algebra at an operatorial level in the quantum theory , at least in the kinematical hilbert space .",
    "a symmetric treatment of the diffeomorphism and hamiltonian constraints requires to develop a technique that allows to implement the generators of spatial diffeomorphisms as operators in the loop representation .",
    "one could attempt to treat the diffeomorphism and hamiltonian constraints on the same footing , for instance by lattice regularizing them .",
    "unfortunately , such discretized versions of the constraints are not first class .",
    "if one treats them properly with the dirac procedure , the resulting theory is vastly different in symmetries and even in the number of degrees of freedom from what one expects to have in the continuum theory .",
    "therefore there is little chance that one could define a continuum theory as a suitable limit of the constructed lattice theories .",
    "these problems have led to the consideration of extensions of the dirac procedure that could better accommodate this particular problem with the constraint algebra .",
    "one such approach is the `` master constraint '' programme of thiemann and collaborators @xcite .",
    "another approach that we have been studying in the last few years are the `` uniform discretizations '' @xcite .",
    "both approaches have some elements in common .",
    "uniform discretizations are discrete versions of a constrained theory in which the discretized form of the constraints are quantities whose values are under control throughout the system s evolution .",
    "notice that this would not be the case , for instance , if one simply takes a constrained theory and discretizes it .",
    "initial data on which the discrete version of the constraints vanishes will evolve into data with non - vanishing values of the discrete constraints , without any control on the final value .",
    "this situation is well known , for instance , in numerical relativity .",
    "uniform discretizations are designed in such a way that the discrete constraints are kept under control upon evolution and that one can take appropriate limits in the initial data such that one can satisfy the constraints to an arbitrary ( and controlled ) degree of accuracy .",
    "this therefore guarantees the existence of a well defined continuum limit at the level of the classical theory .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the uniform discretization technique is classically equivalent to the dirac procedure when the constraints are first class . for second class constraints , like the ones that arise when",
    "one discretizes continuum systems with first class constraints the uniform discretization technique is radically different from the dirac procedure , yielding a dynamical evolution that recovers in the continuum limit the continuum theory one started with .",
    "although the existence of a continuum limit is generically guaranteed at a classical level , it is not obvious that it is at the quantum level .",
    "it is known @xcite that there are models in which the continuum limit can not be achieved and one is left with a non - zero minimum value of the expectation value of the sum squared of the constraints .",
    "it is therefore of interest to show that in examples of growing complexity and of increasing similarity to general relativity one can indeed define a continuum quantum theory with the desired symmetries by applying the uniform discretization procedure .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to discuss one such model .",
    "we will consider the quantization via uniform discretizations of a @xmath0 dimensional model with diffeomorphism symmetry and we will show that the symmetry is recovered at the quantum level correctly .",
    "this raises the hopes of having a theory where all the constraints are treated on an equal footing .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss the model we will consider . in section iii",
    "we discretize the model . in section",
    "iv we review the uniform discretization procedure and how it departs from the dirac traditional approach .",
    "section vi discusses the quantization using uniform discretizations and how one recovers the correct continuum limit .",
    "we conclude with a discussion .",
    "we would like to construct a model by considering spherically symmetric gravity and ignoring the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "this is analogous to building a `` husain  kuchar '' @xcite version of spherically symmetric gravity .",
    "it is known that these models correspond to degenerate space - times when translated in terms of the metric variables .",
    "we refer the reader to our previous work on spherically symmetric gravity @xcite for the setup of the model in terms of ashtekar s new variables . just as a recap , the model has two canonical pairs @xmath9 and @xmath10 . the relation to the more traditional metric canonical variables is , @xmath11 and we have set the immirzi parameter to one for simplicity , since it does not play a role in this analysis .",
    "the lagrangian for spherically symmetric gravity ignoring the hamiltonian constraint is , @xmath12 with @xmath5 a lagrange multiplier ( the radial component of the shift vector ) .",
    "the equations of motion are @xmath13 the theory has one constraint , which is the remaining diffeomorphism constraint in the radial @xmath14 direction , @xmath15 , which we will write smeared as @xmath16 .",
    "the constraint generates diffeomorphisms of the fields , with @xmath17 and @xmath18 behaving as scalars and @xmath19 and @xmath20 as a densities of weight one , @xmath21 the constraint has the usual algebra of diffeomorphisms , @xmath22    observables are integrals of densities of weight one constructed with the fields , for example , @xmath23 with @xmath24 a function .",
    "one then has @xmath25 = \\int dx \\partial_x \\left(f nk_x\\right)=0,\\ ] ] if one considers a compact spatial manifold , @xmath26 , which we will do throughout this paper .",
    "( this may not make a lot of sense if one is thinking of the model as a reduction of @xmath1 spherical symmetry , but we are just avoiding including boundary terms , which are straightforward to treat in the spherical case , see @xcite , in order to simplify the discussion of diffeomorphism invariance ) .",
    "we now proceed to discretize the model . the spatial direction @xmath27 is discretized into points @xmath28 such that @xmath29 and the distances are smaller than a bound @xmath30 when measured in some fiducial metric . to simplify notation , from now on we will assume the points are equally spaced and drop the suffix @xmath31 on @xmath32 , but the analysis can be straightforwardly extended to the case with variable @xmath33 .",
    "the variables of the model become @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the constraint is , @xmath38 the constraint algebra is not first class , i.e. , @xmath39 which does not reproduce the constraint .",
    "what one has is a `` classical anomaly '' of the form @xmath40 .",
    "these terms would tend to zero if one takes the separation @xmath32 to zero and the variables behave continuously in such a limit .",
    "so if one were to simply quantize the discrete model , one would run into trouble since one would be quantizing a classical theory with second class constraints .",
    "we will expand more on the problems one faces in the next section . in this paper",
    "we would like to show that in spite of this problem of the classical theory , which implies that the discrete theory loses diffeomorphism invariance , if one follows the uniform discretization approach to quantization the diffeomorphism invariance is recovered in the limit @xmath41 both at the classical and quantum level .    in the uniform discretization approach one",
    "constructs a `` master constraint '' @xmath42 by considering the sum of the discretized constraints squared .",
    "one then promotes the resulting quantity to a quantum operator and seeks for the eigenstates of @xmath43 with minimum eigenvalue . in the full theory",
    "the quantity @xmath42 would be constructed from the diffeomorphism constraints @xmath44 as , @xmath45 which motivates in our example to choose , @xmath46 or , in the discretized theory as , @xmath47    to understand better how to promote these quantities to quantum operators , it is best to start with the constraint itself .",
    "let us go back for a second to the continuum notation , and write , @xmath48}{\\epsilon } k_x(x_j)+ \\frac{1}{2}\\left[e^\\varphi(x_{j})+e^\\varphi(x_{j+1})\\right ] \\frac{\\left(k_\\varphi(x_{j+1})-k_\\varphi(x_j)\\right)}{\\epsilon}\\right\\ } , \\ ] ] which would reproduce the constraint @xmath49 though we see that the explicit dependence on @xmath32 drops out .",
    "we have chosen to regularize @xmath20 at the midpoint in order to simplify the action of the resulting quantum operator as we will see later .",
    "when one is to promote these quantities to quantum operators , one needs to remember that although the @xmath50 variables promote readily to quantum operators in the loop representation , the @xmath51 s need to be written in exponentiated form . to this aim , we write , classically , @xmath52 } k_x(x_j)+ i\\epsilon{\\left[e^\\varphi(x_{j})+e^\\varphi(x_{j+1})\\right ] } \\left(k_\\varphi(x_{j+1})-k_\\varphi(x_j)\\right)\\right)-1\\right\\},\\ ] ] which again would reproduce the constraint in the continuum limit .",
    "let us rewrite it in terms of the discrete variables , @xmath53 } k_{x , j}+ { \\left[e^\\varphi_{j}+e^\\varphi_{j+1}\\right ] } \\left(k_{\\varphi , j+1}-k_{\\varphi , j}\\right)\\right)\\right]-1\\right\\}.\\ ] ]    for later use , it is convenient to rewrite @xmath54 and then one has that , @xmath55 we dropped the @xmath32 in @xmath56 since it does not explicitly depend on it , but it does through the dependence on @xmath18 and an irrelevant global factor of @xmath57 to simplify future expressions .",
    "before quantizing , we will study the classical theory using uniform discretizations and we will verify that one gets in the continuum limit a theory with diffeomorphism constraints that are first class .",
    "the continuum theory can be treated with the dirac technique and has first class constraints that generate diffeomorphisms on the dynamical variables . however , the discrete theory , when treated with the dirac technique , has second class constraints and does not have the gauge invariances of the continuum theory .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom changes and the continuum limit generically does not recover the theory one started with .",
    "as mentioned before , it has been shown @xcite that the uniform discretization technique is equivalent to the dirac procedure when the constraints are first class . for second class constraints , like the ones that appear when",
    "one discretizes continuum systems with first class constraints the uniform discretization technique is radically different from the dirac procedure , yielding a dynamical evolution that recovers in the continuum limit the continuum theory one started with .",
    "let us review how this works .",
    "we start with a classical canonical system with @xmath5 configuration variables , parameterized by a continuous parameter @xmath58 such that @xmath59 is the `` continuum limit '' .",
    "we will assume the theory in the continuum has @xmath60 constraints @xmath61 .",
    "in the discrete theory we will assume the constraints generically fail to be first class , @xmath62 where the failure is quantified by @xmath63 .",
    "we assume that in the continuum limit one has @xmath64 and that the quantities @xmath65 become in the limit the structure functions of the ( first class ) constraint algebra of the continuum theory @xmath66 , so that , @xmath67    if one were to insist on treating the above discrete theory using the dirac procedure , that is , taking the constraints @xmath68 and a total hamiltonian @xmath69 with @xmath70 functions of the canonical variables , one immediately finds restrictions on the @xmath71 of the form @xmath72 in order to preserve the constraints upon evolution . only in the continuum @xmath59 limit",
    "are the @xmath70 free functions and one has in the theory @xmath73 observables .",
    "notice that away from the continuum limit the number of observables is generically larger and could even reach @xmath74 if the matrix @xmath63 is invertible .",
    "therefore one can not view the theory in the @xmath59 limit as a limit of the theories for finite values of @xmath58 , since they do not even have the same number of observables and have a completely different evolution .",
    "the uniform discretizations , on the other hand , lead to discrete theories that have the same number of observables and an evolution resembling those of the continuum theory .",
    "one can then claim that the discrete theories approximate the continuum theory and the latter arises as the continuum limit of them .",
    "the treatment of the system in questions would start with the construction of the `` master constraint '' @xmath75 and defining a discrete time evolution through @xmath42 .",
    "in particular , this implies a discrete time evolution from instant @xmath76 to @xmath77 for the constraints of the form , @xmath78 this evolution implies that @xmath79 is a constant of the motion , which for convenience we denote via a parameter @xmath80 such that @xmath81 .",
    "the preservation upon evolution of @xmath79 implies that the constraints remain bounded @xmath82 .",
    "if one now divides by @xmath80 and defines the quantities @xmath83 one can rewrite ( [ evolution ] ) as , @xmath84 notice that the @xmath85 remain finite when one takes the limits @xmath86 and @xmath59 .",
    "if one now considers the limit of small @xmath80 s , one notes that the first term on the right is of order @xmath80 , the second one goes to zero with @xmath59 , at least as @xmath58 and the rest of the terms are of higher orders in @xmath87 . if one identifies with a continuum variable @xmath88 such that @xmath89 , then @xmath90 and @xmath91 one can take the limits @xmath59 and @xmath86 , irrespective of the order of the limits one gets that the evolution equations ( [ evolution ] ) for the constraints become those of the continuum theory , i.e. , @xmath92 with @xmath93 become the ( freely specifiable ) lagrange multipliers of the continuum theory . at this point the reader may be puzzled , since the @xmath94 s are defined as limits of those of the discrete theory and therefore do not appear to be free .",
    "however , one has to recall that the @xmath94 s in the discrete theory are determined by the values of the constraints evaluated on the initial data , and these can be chosen arbitrarily by modifying the initial data .",
    "if one considers the limit @xmath86 for a finite value of @xmath58 ( `` continuous in time , discrete in space '' ) and considers the evolution of a function of phase space @xmath95 , one has that , @xmath96    the necessary and sufficient condition for @xmath95 to be a constant of the motion ( that is , @xmath97 ) is that @xmath98 with @xmath99 a vector , perhaps vanishing , that is annihilated by the matrix , @xmath100    up to now we have assumed @xmath85 arbitrary and not necessarily satisfying that @xmath101 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath102 and therefore @xmath103 which implies that conserved quantities in the discrete theory yield in the limit @xmath59 the observables of the continuum theory .",
    "since the @xmath93 s are free the theory with continuous time is not the one that would result naively from applying the dirac procedure since in the latter the lagrange multipliers are restricted by @xmath104 and therefore the theory admits more observables than the @xmath73 of the continuum theory .",
    "that is , if one takes the `` continuum in time '' limit first , the discrete theory has a dynamics that differs from the usual one unless @xmath105 and one is really treating two different theories .    at this point it would be good to clarify a bit the notation . the above discussion has been for a mechanical system with @xmath60 configuration degrees of freedom .",
    "when one discretizes a field theory with @xmath60 configuration degrees of freedom on a lattice with @xmath5 points one ends up with a mechanical system that has @xmath106 degrees of freedom .",
    "an example of such a system would be the diffeomorphism constraints of general relativity in @xmath1 dimensions when discretized on a uniform lattice of spacing @xmath58 @xcite . of course , it is not clear at this point if such a system could be completely treated with our technique up to the last consequences , we just mention it here as an example of the type of system one would like to treat .",
    "the above discussion extends immediately to systems of this kind , only the bookkeeping has to be improved a bit .",
    "if we consider a parameter @xmath107 , such that the continuum limit is achieved in @xmath108 the classical continuum constraints can be thought of as limits @xmath109 where @xmath110 is such that the point @xmath27 in the continuum lies between @xmath110 and @xmath111 on the lattice for every @xmath5 .",
    "we are assuming a one dimensional lattice .",
    "similar bookkeepings can be set up in higher dimensional cases .",
    "just like we did in the mechanical system we can define @xmath112 ( where we have assumed that for the sites different from @xmath113 on the lattice the poisson bracket vanishes , the generalization to other cases is immediate ) and one has that @xmath114 if one takes the spatial limit @xmath59 first , one has a theory with discrete time and continuous space and with first class constraints and we know in that case the uniform discretization procedure agrees with the dirac quantization .",
    "if one has more than one spatial dimension to discretize , then the situation complicates , since the continuum limit can be achieved with lattices of different topologies and connectivity .",
    "once one has chosen a given topology and connectivity for the lattice , the continuum limit will only produce spin networks of connectivities compatible with such lattices .",
    "for instance if one takes a `` square '' lattice in terms of connectivity in two spatial dimensions , one would produce at most spin networks in the continuum with four valent vertices .",
    "if one takes a lattice that resembles a honeycomb with triangular plaquettes one would produce sextuple vertices , etc .",
    "it is clear that this point deserves further study insofar as to how to achieve the continuum limit in theories with more than one spatial dimension .",
    "in addition to this , following the uniform discretization approach one does not need to modify the discrete constraint algebra since it satisfies @xmath115 and all the observables of the continuum theory arise by taking the continuum limit of the constants of the motion of the discrete theory .",
    "the encouraging fact that we recover the continuum theory in the limit classically is what raises hopes that a similar technique will also work at the quantum level .",
    "to proceed to quantize the model , we need to consider the master constraint given in equation ( [ 27 ] ) , @xmath116 and quantize it .",
    "the quantization of this expression will require appropriate ordering of the exponential that appears in @xmath117 , putting the @xmath51 s to the left of the @xmath50 s , as in usual normal ordering .",
    "one would then have , @xmath118 } \\hat{k}_{x , j}+ { \\left[\\hat{e}^\\varphi_{j}+\\hat{e}^\\varphi_{j+1}\\right ] } \\left(\\hat{k}_{\\varphi , j+1}-\\hat{k}_{\\varphi , j}\\right)\\right ) : \\label{d}\\ ] ] notice that @xmath119 is not self - adjoint and , due to the factor ordering , neither is @xmath120 , but we will see that one can construct an @xmath121 that is self - adjoint .    to write the explicit action , let us recall the nature of the basis of spin network states in one dimension ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "one has a lattice of points @xmath122 . on such lattice one",
    "has a graph @xmath123 consistent of a collection of links @xmath124 connecting the vertices @xmath125 . it is natural to associate the variable @xmath19 with links in the graph and the variable @xmath17 with vertices of the graph . for bookkeeping purposes we will associate each link with the lattice site to its left .",
    "one then constructs the `` point holonomies '' for both variables as , @xmath126{f1new}}\\right\\rangle= \\exp\\left(i\\sum_{j } { k_j } k_{x , j}\\epsilon \\right ) \\exp\\left(i\\sum_j \\mu_{j , v } k_{\\varphi , j}\\right)\\ ] ] the summations go through all the points in the lattice and we allow the possibility of using `` empty '' links to define the graph , i.e. links where @xmath127 .",
    "the vertices of the graph therefore correspond to lattice sites where one of the two following conditions are met : either @xmath128 or @xmath129 .    in terms of this basis",
    "it is straightforward to write the action of the operator defined in ( [ d ] ) , @xmath130{f1 } } \\right\\rangle & = & \\left\\vert\\vphantom{\\frac{1}{1}}\\right.\\left .",

    "the exponential of @xmath135 adds @xmath94 to @xmath132 , whereas the exponential of @xmath136 adds @xmath76 to @xmath137 .",
    "an interesting particular case is that of an isolated @xmath138 populated vertex , @xmath139{f4 } } \\right\\rangle = \\left\\vert\\vphantom{\\frac{1}{1}}\\right.\\left . \\raisebox{-5mm}{\\includegraphics[height=1.5cm]{f5 } } \\right\\rangle.\\ ] ] so we see that the operator @xmath140 moves the line to a new vertex .",

    "we now need to turn our attention to the other terms in the construction of @xmath43 in order to have a complete quantum version of ( [ 27 ] ) .",
    "the discretization we will propose is , as , @xmath145 where @xmath146{\\epsilon e^x_j}/(e^\\varphi_j)^{3/2}$ ] , and we have chosen to localize @xmath147 and @xmath117 at different points .",
    "intuitively this can be seen in the fact that @xmath140 `` shifts '' links in the spin nets to the next neighbor whereas @xmath148 just acts as a prefactor , as we will discuss in the next paragraph .",
    "therefore if one wishes to find cancellations between both terms in ( [ discretizacion ] ) one needs to delocalize the action of both @xmath148 s .",
    "the quantization of @xmath147 has been studied in the literature before @xcite . since these operators only act multiplicatively , it is better to revert to a simpler notation for the states @xmath149 .",

    "since this operator has a simple action through a prefactor , we will call such prefactor @xmath151 .",

    "it is worthwhile noticing that if @xmath154 the map is from a diagram with one insertion to another with one insertion , if @xmath155 it goes from one insertion to two and if both @xmath156 and @xmath157 are non - vanishing it maps two insertions to two insertions .",
    "it is not possible to go from a state with two consecutive insertions into one with only one insertion , since if @xmath158 then @xmath159 .",
    "this is a key property one seeks in the regularization .",

    "analogously , one can show that for spin networks with @xmath177 vertices @xmath178 , and therefore the states that minimize @xmath179 include in the limit @xmath108 the diffeomorphism invariant states obtained via the group averaging procedure . to see this",

    "this sum is the discrete version of the sum on the group that is performed in the continuum group averaging procedure.the sum preserves the cyclic order placing the vertices in all the positions compatible with such order .",
    "we have shown that the expectation value of @xmath43 vanishes in the continuum limit .",
    "since @xmath43 is a positive definite operator this also implies that @xmath186 , which is the condition one seeks in the uniform discretization approach .",
    "this can be explicitly checked by computing , for instance for a state @xmath187 , @xmath188 where the sum over @xmath189 means a sum over a basis of spin networks @xmath190 and the @xmath191 are spin network states that have vertices at consecutive sites @xmath31 and @xmath169 .",
    "given that the @xmath192 s are finite coefficients independent of @xmath5 one immediately sees that the right hand side has zero norm when @xmath176 .",
    "there is a rather important difference with the continuum case , however .",
    "the states constructed here as limits of discrete states are normalizable with the kinematical inner product and therefore the calculation suggests that in a problem with a hamiltonian constraint in addition to diffeomorphism constraints one could work all constraints in the discrete theory on an equal footing .",
    "we have seen in a @xmath0 dimensional model with diffeomorphism invariance that one can discretize it , therefore breaking the invariance , and treat it using the `` uniform discretizations '' approach yielding a diffeomorphism invariant theory in the continuum limit . we have argued that this would have been close to impossible if one had naively discretized the constraints and quantized the resulting theory .",
    "an important point to realize is that the the kinematical hilbert space has been changed , by considering spin networks on `` lattices '' with a countable number of points .",
    "there exist infinitely many possible such lattices built by considering different spacings between the points .",
    "however , in @xmath0 dimensions the choice of lattice does not influence the diffeomorphism invariant quantum theory , whose observables can be written in terms of the canonical variables and invariant combinations of their derivatives that can be entirely framed in terms of @xmath193 and @xmath194 without reference to details of the lattice .",
    "for instance , the total volume of a slice evaluated on a diffeomorphism invariant spin network @xmath195 is given by @xmath196 where the sum is over all vertices of the continuum spin network and @xmath197 are the values of @xmath198 emanating to the right and left of vertex @xmath125 .",
    "more generally , consider an observable @xmath199 , that is an operator invariant under diffeomorphisms .",
    "let us study in the space of lattices with a countable number of points its expectation value on diffeomorphism invariant states @xmath200 , with @xmath201 the cyclic state we considered in the previous section . in the continuum the vectors of the hilbert space of diffeomorphism invariant states @xmath202 where @xmath203 is the knot class of a spin network @xmath189 belong to the dual of the space of kinematic spin network states @xmath190 .",
    "the expectation value of the observable in the continuum is @xmath204 and the result of both expectation values in the continuum and in the discrete theory coincide .",
    "the reason for this is that the action of @xmath205 on one of the terms in @xmath206 coincides with @xmath207 except when @xmath189 has vertices that occupy consecutive positions on the lattice . in this case , depending on the specific form of @xmath208 the results could differ . due to the normalization factor , however , such exceptional contributions contribute a factor @xmath209 in the @xmath176 limit , so we have that in the continuum limit the expectation values in the continuum and the discrete always agree .",
    "an issue of importance in loop quantum gravity is the problem of ambiguities in the definition of the quantum theory .",
    "apart from the usual factor ordering ambiguities in a discrete theory one adds the ambiguities of the discretization process . in this example",
    "we have made several careful choices in this process to ensure that the operator @xmath43 has a non - trivial kernel in the continuum limit .",
    "this requirement proved in practice quite onerous to satisfy and it took quite a bit of effort to satisfy the requirement .",
    "though in no way we claim that the results are unique , it hints at the fact that requiring that @xmath43 have a non - trivial kernel in the continuum significantly reduces the level of ambiguities in the definition of a quantum discrete theory .",
    "we have not been able to find another regularization satisfying the requirement an leading to a different non - trivial kernel .",
    "another point to note is that the quantum diffeomorphism constraints @xmath210 with @xmath211 stemming from discretizing a smooth shift function do not reproduce the continuum algebra of constraints when they act on generic spin networks on the lattice that belong to the kinematical hilbert space .",
    "the algebra almost works , but there appear anomalous contributions for spin networks with vertices in two consecutive sites of the lattice . in spite of this the constraints can be imposed at a quantum level through the condition @xmath212 and imply , as we showed , that the solutions correspond to a discrete version of the sum in the group that is performed in the group averaging procedure .",
    "the difference is that these states are normalizable with the inner product of the kinematical space itself . in this construction",
    "the hilbert space @xmath213 is a subspace of @xmath214 , unlike the situation in the ordinary group averaging procedure .",
    "this property opens interesting possibilities , particularly if it holds in more elaborate models .",
    "if such a property were to hold in more complex models , for instance involving a hamiltonian constraint , it would be very important since it would provide immediate access to a physical inner product .",
    "all of the above suggests that in more realistic models than the one we studied , for instance when there is a hamiltonian constraint ( with structure functions in the constraint algebra ) one will also be able to define the diffeomorphism and the hamiltonian constraints as quantum operators and impose them as constraints ( or equivalently , to impose the `` master constraint '' @xmath42 ) .",
    "they would act on the kinematic hilbert space of the discrete theory , and one would hope that a suitable continuum limit can be defined",
    ". we would therefore have a way of defining a continuum quantum theory via discretization and taking the continuum limit even in systems where the discretization changes the nature of the constraints from first to second class . in @xmath0 dimensions the procedure appears quite promising .",
    "it should be noted that this is a quite rich arena in physical phenomena , including gowdy cosmologies , the choptuik phenomena and several models of black hole formation .",
    "the fact that we could envision treating these problems in detail in the quantum theory in the near future is quite attractive . in higher dimensions",
    "the viability of the approach will require further study , in particular since the discretization scheme chosen could constrain importantly the types of spin networks that one can construct in the continuum theory .    summarizing ,",
    "we have presented the first example of a model with infinitely many degrees of freedom where the uniform discretization procedure works out to the last consequences , providing a continuum theory with diffeomorphism invariance and where the master constraint has a non - trivial kernel .",
    "it also leads to an explicit construction of the physical hilbert space that is different from the usual one , allowing the introduction of the kinematical inner product as the physical one .",
