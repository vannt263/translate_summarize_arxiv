    "the piezoelectric effect is a coupling between electrical and mechanical fields within certain materials that has numerous applications ranging from ultrasound generation in medical imaging and therapy via acceleration sensors and injection valves in automotive industry to high precision positioning systems .",
    "driven by the increasing demand for devices operating at high field intensities especially in actuator applications , the field of hysteresis modeling for piezoelectric materials is currently one of highly active research .",
    "the approaches that have been considered so far can be divided into basically four categories :    1 .   _ thermodynamically consistent models _ being based on a macroscopic view to describe microscopic phenomena in such a way that the second law of thermodynamics is satisfied , see for example , bassiouny and ghaleb @xcite , kamlah and bhle @xcite , landis @xcite , schrder and romanowski @xcite , su and landis @xcite , linnemann et al .",
    "micromechanical models _ that consider the material on the level of single grains , see , for example , delibas et al .",
    "@xcite , frhlich @xcite , huber and fleck @xcite , belov and kreher @xcite , huber @xcite , mcmeeking et al .",
    "@xcite , smith and hu @xcite .",
    "_ phase field models _ that describe the transition between phases ( corresponding to the motion of walls between domains with different polarization orientation ) using the ginzburg - landau equation for some order parameter , see , for example xu et al @xcite , wang et al @xcite .",
    "4 .   _ phenomenological models using hysteresis operators _ partly originating from the input - output description of piezoelectric devices for control purposes , see , for example , hughes and wen @xcite , kuhnen @xcite , cima et al .",
    "@xcite , smith et al .",
    "@xcite , ball et al .",
    "@xcite , pasco and berry @xcite .    also multiscale coupling between macro- and microscopic as well as phase field models partly even down to atomistic simulations has been investigated , see , e.g. , @xcite .    for a mathematical analysis of some thermodynamically consistent models we refer to @xcite .",
    "whereas most of the so far existing models are designed for the simulation of polarization , depolarization or cycling along the main hysteresis loop , the simulation of actuators requires the accurate simulation of minor loops as well .",
    "moreover , the physical behavior can so far be reproduced only qualitatively , whereas the use of models in actuator simulation ( possibly also aiming at simulation based optimization ) needs to match measurements precisely .",
    "simulation of a piezoelectric device with a possibly complex geometry requires not only an input - output model but needs to resolve the spatial distribution of the crucial electric and mechanical field quantities , which leads to partial differential equations .",
    "therewith , the question of numerical efficiency becomes important .",
    "preisach operators @xcite are phenomenological models for rate independent hysteresis that are capable of reproducing minor loops and can be very well fitted to measurements .",
    "moreover , they allow for a highly efficient evaluation by the application of certain memory deletion rules and the use of so - called everett or shape functions .    motivated by these facts , in @xcite , a model for ferroelectric hysteresis under uniaxial loading using preisach operators is proposed and studied .",
    "like most of the above mentioned models , it is based on an additive decomposition of the strain and the polarization into reversible and irreversible parts .",
    "the reversible quantities follow the linear piezoelectric material law , while the irreversible polarization is represented by a preisach operator of the imposed electric field and the irreversible strain is a polynomial function of the polarization .",
    "moreover , the piezoelectric coupling coefficient is proportional to the polarization .",
    "however , for the model from @xcite , it is not clear whether or under which conditions the second law of thermodynamics is satisfied .",
    "we will therefore here consider a new material law , which is inspired by the one proposed for magnetostriction @xcite whose thermodynamic consistency is based on the use of hysteresis potentials , and which is additionally able to capture ferroelastic effects .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ mode ]",
    ", we derive piezoelectric constitutive equations involving a preisach hysteresis operator from basic thermodynamic principles and show some simulation results with the proposed model .",
    "section [ prei ] is devoted to the proof of a new result on lipschitz invertibility of the preisach operator with time dependent coefficients , and in section [ long ] we construct a unique solution of a system of electromechanical balance equations by banach contraction principle .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the situation of uniaxial loading , hence scalar constitutive relations .",
    "a perspective to the situation of electric and mechanic fields depending on three space variables while still considering uniaxial loading , is provided in section [ thin ] .",
    "the case of vector or actually tensor valued hysteresis will be subject of future research .",
    "differently from most of the above cited approaches , we consider the electric field @xmath0 and the mechanical strain @xmath1 as state variables and the dielectric displacement @xmath2 as well as the mechanical stress @xmath3 as state functions .",
    "the reason for doing so lies in the fact that the balance equations    ( namely newton s law on the mechanical side and gauss law on the electric side ) @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is the mechanical displacement , @xmath6 the symmetric gradient and @xmath7 the dyadic divergence ) are naturally formulated in terms of these state functions .    for the interrelation between these quantities , we assume , similarly to @xcite , that hysteresis effects are due to one single preisach operator @xmath8 with potential @xmath9 acting on an auxiliary state function @xmath10 . in the scalar case",
    ", this leads to the assumption that the stress @xmath11 , the dielectric displacement @xmath12 , and the free energy @xmath13 are of the form @xmath14 + b { { \\mathcal{u}}}[q ] , \\label{law_sigma_1d}\\\\   d&= & { e}{\\varepsilon}+\\kappa e + c { { \\mathcal{p}}}[q ] + d { { \\mathcal{u}}}[q ] , \\label{law_d_1d}\\\\   f&= & \\frac{{\\underline{c}}}{2}{\\varepsilon}^2+\\frac{\\kappa}{2}e^2 + \\xi { { \\mathcal{p}}}[q ] + \\eta { { \\mathcal{u}}}[q ] , \\label{ansatz_f_1d}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the coefficients @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 as well as the function @xmath21 , are to be determined in agreement with the principles of thermodynamics .",
    "the elastic , dielectric , and piezoelectric coupling coefficients @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 are given constants .",
    "it will be shown in section [ prei ] that the preisach hysteresis operator with nonnegative density satisfies the energy inequality @xmath25(t)-\\frac{\\dd}{\\dd t}{{\\mathcal{u}}}[q](t)\\geq 0\\ \\mbox { a.e . }",

    "we resume the analysis of this system in section [ long ] and before , in section [ prei ] , we establish some new properties of the preisach operator which will enable us to eliminate @xmath0 from the system by solving eq .   independently with respect to @xmath62 .",
    "we wish to mention that independence of the dielectric saturation value on the stress ( which is the case e.g. for the setting @xmath63 , @xmath64 considered in section 3.4.1 of @xcite ) physically makes sense also here : note that saturation of the polarization , i.e. , of @xmath65 $ ] taking its maximal absolute value , corresponds to the situation of all c - axes ( and therewith all elementary dipoles ) of the single crystals being aligned as much as possible to the load axis , under the given geometric constraints ( note that each grain has its own coordinate system of preferred directions ) .",
    "this maximal alignment gives the same polarization , independent of the imposed stress .",
