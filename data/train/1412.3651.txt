    "the evolution of the shell structure and the associated quadrupole collectivity with nucleon number is among the most prominent features in atomic nuclei .",
    "its study has received renewed interest in recent years due to the progress in our understanding of neutron - rich nuclei far away from the valley of stability brought by the radioactive ion beam ( rib ) facilities set up all over the world .",
    "shell effects in neutron - rich nuclei turn out to be quite challenging and , at least in some cases , they can not be interpreted using the experience accumulated for stable systems @xcite .",
    "a typical example is the weakening / erosion of the n=20 and n=28 magic numbers in light neutron - rich nuclei ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) .    in a mean field framework ,",
    "the nucleus @xmath3 mg is predicted to have a spherical ground state @xcite .",
    "however , the experimental b(e2 , 0@xmath1 @xmath4 2@xmath1 ) value @xcite , the excitation energy of the 2@xmath1 state @xcite as well as the ratio @xmath5=2.6 are all consistent with those of a deformed ground state . within the shell model ,",
    "the increased quadrupole collectivity in nuclei of this region has been explained by invoking neutron excitations across the n=20 shell gap @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it has been shown that effects not explicitly taken into account at the mean field level like the restoration of broken symmetries and configuration mixing , can account for a deformed ground state in @xmath3 mg and @xmath6ne as well as the main physical trends in nuclei around the _ island of inversion _ @xcite .",
    "this has been further corroborated by the recent study of the quadrupole collectivity in @xmath7ne and @xmath8 mg @xcite .",
    "the situation is slightly different in the case of neutron - rich nuclei around n=28 where shell model @xcite , mean field @xcite and beyond mean field @xcite calculations predict deformed ground states , in agreement with experimental results @xcite , and indicating that this neutron shell closure is more fragile than the n=20 one .",
    "the previous examples already illustrate the challenges encountered in the theoretical description of neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "they suggest that caution must be taken when invoking the weakening / erosion of neutron magic numbers and reveal that plain mean field approximations @xcite , while valuable as a starting point , may not be sufficient since the quadrupole properties in the considered nuclei may actually be determined by the subtle interplay between quantum corrections stemming from the restoration of the broken symmetries ( mainly the rotational one ) and fluctuations in the collective degrees of freedom .",
    "similar conclusions can be extracted from other beyond mean field calculations ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) . on the neutron deficient side ,",
    "symmetry - projected configuration mixing results indicate that z=82 remains , on the average , as a conserved magic proton number for pb isotopes and support the experimental evidences for rotational bands built on coexisting low - lying prolate and oblate 0@xmath9 states @xcite .",
    "shell effects play a crucial role in understanding the nucleosynthesis of nuclei heavier than fe via the r - process @xcite .",
    "though different r - process scenarios and uncertainties are still under debate ( see , for example , @xcite ) , it is commonly accepted that the r - process passes through the neutron numbers n=50 , 82 and 126 and that the synthesis of nuclei around them is revealed in the peaks of the r - process abundances around the mass numbers a @xmath10 80 , 130 and 190 , respectively .",
    "therefore , a sound theoretical description of the shell effects around n=50 , 82 and 126 represents a major goal not only for nuclear structure physics but also for astrophysics .",
    "it should be kept in mind that , due to their large neutron excess , very neutron - rich nuclei near the r - process path remain out of reach experimentally , especially those in the heavy mass region .",
    "therefore , our understanding of those systems requires the use of different theoretical tools whose predictions have been the subject of intense debate @xcite . for example , shell quenching has been invoked @xcite at n=82 near the r - process path to improve the predicted r - process abundances around the second peak .",
    "the anomalous behavior of the 2@xmath1 states in neutron - rich cd isotopes has even been cited @xcite as an evidence for such a quenching .",
    "however , it has also been shown that this anomalous behavior can be naturally explained in the framework of symmetry - projected configuration mixing calculations @xcite without the need to assume any quenching of the n=82 shell closure .",
    "this is further corroborated by experimental results on energy levels in @xmath11cd @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we have studied the quadrupole collectivity in the region of the third peak of the r - process .",
    "to this end , we have considered even - even nd , sm , gd , dy , er , yb , hf and w nuclei with neutron numbers 122 @xmath0 n @xmath0 156 extending beyond the two - neutron dripline .",
    "the constrained hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) approximation @xcite is used to obtain the mean field potential energy curves ( mfpecs ) corresponding to the hfb energies as a function of the quadrupole moment .",
    "the mfpecs offer a valuable starting point to understand the evolution of the shell structure across n=126 as well as the emergence of quadrupole deformations in the considered isotopic chains .",
    "in particular , it will be shown that the onset of mean field ( i.e. , static ) quadrupole deformation after crossing the spherical n=126 neutron shell closure leads to a pronounced enhancement of the two - neutron separation energies as compared with the ones resulting from the spherical hfb scheme .",
    "-e@xmath12 between the hfb ground state energies obtained for the nuclei @xmath13nd , @xmath14sm , @xmath15gd , @xmath16dy , @xmath17er , @xmath18yb , @xmath19hf and @xmath20w with the d1 m and d1s parametrizations are plotted as a function of neutron number .",
    ", scaledwidth=47.5% ]    the d1 m parametrization @xcite of the gogny @xcite edf is used in all the hfb calculations . in some instances , however , results obtained with the gogny - d1s @xcite edf will be shown for comparison .",
    "the reason is that the gogny - d1s edf has a strong reputation of being able to reproduce a large collection of low - energy nuclear data all over the nuclear chart both at the mean field level and beyond and related to deformation effects ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , it has to be kept in mind that d1s is not specially good in reproducing binding energies as shown in large scale calculations @xcite where a systematic drift is observed in the differences between the experimental and theoretical binding energies in heavy isotopes .",
    "the d1 m fitting protocol includes @xcite both realistic neutron matter equation of state ( eos ) information and the binding energies of all known nuclei . with an impressive rms of 0.798 mev it represents a competitive choice to deal with nuclear masses .",
    "in addition to previous studies @xcite , new ones including fission properties in heavy and superheavy nuclei @xcite as well as odd nuclei within the equal filling approximation ( efa ) @xcite , suggest that the gogny - d1 m edf essentially retains the predictive power of the well tested d1s parametrization and therefore it represents a good candidate to replace the latter .",
    "the mfpecs obtained within the gogny - hfb framework display , at least for some nd , sm , gd , dy , er , yb , hf and w nuclei , competing minima based on different intrinsic configurations indicating that beyond mean field correlations like symmetry restoration and/or quadrupole configuration mixing , may play a role . that the restoration of the broken rotational symmetry may provide leading quantum corrections can be expected from the fact that the energy gain associated with it ( i.e. , the so called rotational correction ) is proportional to the deformation of the intrinsic hfb states @xcite .",
    "similar to what has been found in other regions of the nuclear chart @xcite , symmetry restoration also leads in some of the studied nuclei to important topological changes in the angular momentum projected potential energy curves ( amppecs ) as compared with the corresponding mfpecs .",
    "therefore , it is also important to consider the effect of the quadrupole configuration mixing in those cases .",
    "moreover , even in those nuclei where the amppecs exhibit well defined minima , it is important to check their stability with respect to quadrupole fluctuations since not only the energy landscape but also the underlying collective inertia play a role within a dynamical treatment . with this in mind",
    "we have performed angular momentum projected generator coordinate method ( ampgcm ) calculations @xcite , based on the gogny - d1 m edf , for all the nuclei studied in this work .",
    "in addition to the spectroscopic properties of the excited state the ampgcm also provides the ground state correlation energy that , as we will see , plays an important role in the properties of the n=126 shell closure .",

    "since the main interest of the present study is focussed on the two - neutron separation energies s@xmath76 , rotational energy corrections , excitation energies , etc . , and these quantities do not change very much with the considered m@xmath21 value , we conclude that m@xmath21=14 can be regarded as a reasonable compromise between accuracy and computational burden . to corroborate this conclusion , the two - neutron separation energies ( full lines ) computed within the hfb approximation are plotted in fig .",

    "furthermore , while in the spherical hfb approach the two - neutron dripline is reached at n=132 and n=140 for the gd and dy isotopic chains , the presence of static ground state deformation effects in these chains shifts the location of the corresponding two - neutron driplines up to n=148 and n=152 , respectively . for the remaining chains ,",
    "the onset of ground state deformation enhances the stability with respect to the spherical hfb results in the neutron number range between n=132 and n=156 .",
    "the question that naturally arises is to what extent is this enhanced stability dependent on the particular gogny - edf employed at the hfb level . in fig .",
    "[ fig - s2n - shells - d1s ] , we show the two - neutron separation energies obtained with the gogny - d1s edf and m@xmath21=14 .",

    "[ fig - pec - sm_d1 m ] and [ fig - q20-gs - summary ] ) .",
    "however , as already anticipated , the pronounced under - binding obtained with the gogny - d1s edf leads to systematically smaller s@xmath76 values for increasing neutron number . keeping this in mind ,",
    "we conclude that the enhanced stability beyond the neutron shell closure n=126 is a genuine property of gogny - like edfs .",
    "this conclusion is further corroborated by resorting to the parametrization d1n @xcite of the gogny - edf which provides s@xmath76 values closer to the ones obtained with the d1 m parameter set .",
    "note that the results suggest , at least for some of the considered isotopic chains , a shift of the r - process path to higher neutron numbers .",
    "having checked the robustness of the hfb predictions with respect to the considered parametrization of the gogny - edf , it is important to check their stability against quantum corrections stemming from the restoration of broken symmetries ( mainly the rotational symmetry ) and quadrupole configuration mixing .",
    "in addition to ground state properties , such beyond mean field calculations also give access to excited states as well as other ( dynamical ) quadrupole properties in the studied nuclei .",
    "regardless of the gogny - edf employed one observes that in the nd , sm , gd , dy , er , yb , hf and w chains the mfpecs become wider with increasing neutron number and display oblate local minima .",
    "for example , we have found ( see , fig .",
    "[ fig - pec - sm_d1 m ] ) that for @xmath79sm these oblate local minima lie less than 2 mev above the corresponding ground state .",
    "such a shape coexistence also calls for a symmetry - projected configuration mixing analysis . for larger neutron numbers , the excitation energy of the oblate wells increases reaching its largest value ( 2.77 mev and 3.87 mev for the gogny - d1s and gogny - d1 m edfs , respectively ) for @xmath80sm",

    "n=126 nuclei are found to have spherical ground states and the corresponding mean field shell gaps do not exhibit a dramatic reduction when approaching or even crossing the two - neutron driplines .",

    "a shape transition to prolate deformed ground states is predicted to occur around n=132 - 134 within the ( constrained ) hfb framework . as a consequence of the onset of static axially symmetric quadrupole deformations",
