    "recently , transverse - lattice calculations have provided first data @xcite on the _ impact - parameter dependent _ diagonal ( non - skewed ) non - singlet generalized parton distributions of the pion .",

    "the impact - parameter - space formulation has been pursued in refs .",
    "@xcite . actually , this is the natural framework for the transverse lattice qcd formulation  @xcite .",

    "i.e. _ , models incorporating the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking : the recently - proposed _ spectral quark model _  @xcite and the _ nambu  jona - lasinio _ model with the pauli - villars regulator  @xcite . for these models",
    "it has already been shown that the @xmath1-integrated ( forward ) parton distribution functions agree remarkably well with the phenomenological parameterization at @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "our very simple predictions for the gpd , pertaining to a low scale of about 320  mev , are then evolved with the help of the standard dglap equations to the scales corresponding to the transverse - lattice calculations  @xcite .",
    "after the evolution the results of sec .  [ sec : results ] are in a good qualitative agreement with the data , showing similar bjorken-@xmath0 dependence in the corresponding impact - parameter bins .",

    "we note that the predictions of the two models are qualitatively the same , with the njl curves pushed to somewhat lower values of @xmath0 . for the lack of space , in this paper we display the qcd evolution of the spectral quark model only .",
    "the case of the njl model is qualitatively the same , with the corresponding curves moved to a bit lower values of @xmath0 , simply reflecting the different initial condition of fig .",

    "we have checked that if the value the lattice - spacing parameter , @xmath72 , were lowered , an even more quantitative agreement would follow",
    ".    the results for non - central plaquettes also qualitatively agree with the lattice measurements . in this case at @xmath58 the corresponding functions vanish very fast , in accordance to our model formulas .",
    "the difference with the lattice calculation of fig .",
    "2(b ) is that in our case the farther plaquettes naturally bring less and less , and the yield from the @xmath68 $ ] plaquette is lower than for the @xmath67 $ ] plaquette . in fig .",
    "2(b ) it is the other way around .    in summary ,",
    "the obtained agreement of our approach , based on non perturbative chiral quark models in conjunction with perturbative lo dglap evolution , with the data from the transverse lattices , is quite remarkable and encouraging , baring in mind the simplicity of the models and the apparently radically different handling of chiral symmetry in both approaches .",
    "we also note that the low - energy scale taken for the chiral quark models is consistent with previous analysis based both on the forward parton distribution amplitudes as well as the light cone wave function .",
    "our analysis might be reinforced by extending our calculation to include the nlo perturbative corrections .",
    "such a study is left for a future research .",
