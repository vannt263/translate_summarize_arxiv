    "the objective of _ air traffic management _ ( atm ) is to ensure a safe , fair , and efficient flow of air traffic , under minimal environmental impact , subject to constraints on aircraft separation , airspace capacity , and airport capacity .",
    "the mission of eurocontrol , the _",
    "european organisation for the safety of air navigation _",
    "( http://www.eurocontrol.int/[www.eurocontrol.int ] ) , is to promote the harmonisation of the different national atm systems .",
    "eurocontrol is the counterpart of the _ federal aviation administration _ ( faa ) of the usa .",
    "current atm systems in europe are fragmented and already stretched to the limit , and hence unable to cope with the traffic volume foreseen for the year 2020 and beyond . toward ensuring the required sustainability , an ambitious research effort at pan - european level and under the leadership of eurocontrol is now underway to develop a fully integrated next - generation atm system for the so - called _ single european sky _ ( http://www.sesarju.eu/[www.sesarju.eu ] ) .",
    "the context of this paper is our project on long - term innovative research with the _ eurocontrol experimental centre _ ( eec ) in brtigny , france .",
    "today , on the one hand , flight * planning * is made globally , at the strategic and tactical levels , for all @xmath0  eurocontrol countries by the _ central flow management unit _",
    "( cfmu ) of eurocontrol , upon negotiation with the airlines but without sufficient effort at avoiding traffic bottleneck areas . on the other hand ,",
    "flight * control * takes place more locally , within regional air - traffic control centres ( atcc ) , but without a super - regional view when flight re - planning has to be done .",
    "the operations of an atcc rest upon a partition of its civilian airspace into _ sectors _ , that is three - dimensional ( possibly concave ) polygonal regions of airspace that are stacked at various altitudes ( and that often do not follow national boundaries ) . for each sector , a pair of _ air - traffic controllers _ ( atco ) try to ensure the sector capacity and aircraft separation constraints , at the operational level , and without necessarily physically being at the atcc headquarters .",
    "for instance , the three benelux countries and small bordering parts of germany , france , and the north sea are covered by the maastricht atcc in the netherlands , whose airspace is partitioned into about @xmath1  or @xmath2  sectors at every layer , with @xmath3  or @xmath4  layers from the ground to upper airspace .    because of this fragmented mode of operation , the capacity of an atcc is limited by its sector with the smallest capacity , the _ capacity _ of a sector being defined as the maximum hourly number of flights that may enter it . indeed , the total capacity of an atcc could be raised by an early identification of the traffic bottleneck areas and a redoing of the flight plans such that the traffic demand is more evenly balanced between its sectors .",
    "this has triggered the investigation of concepts dealing with _ multi - sector planning _",
    ", where tools are developed to predict the traffic demand over several sectors and to manage the overall demand by anticipating peaks and proposing alternate plans .    furthermore , a long - term goal is to abandon the existing sectors and reorganise the entire airspace of the _",
    "european civil aviation conference _ ( ecac ) by starting from a three - dimensional grid of same - sized box - shaped _ cells _ laid over the whole european continent and some nearby countries .",
    "for instance , in our experiments , using a grid of cells whose dimensions are @xmath5  nm @xmath6 @xmath5  nm @xmath6 @xmath7  fl , we have @xmath8  layers with a total of @xmath9 ecac cells , whose capacities are initially uniformly set to @xmath10  entering flights per hour , to be enforced with a time step of @xmath1  minutes .",
    "this paper presents the first results on _ dynamic demand - capacity balancing _ at ecac level , that is the dynamic modification of ecac flight plans so as to satisfy the capacity constraints of all cells over a given time interval at minimal cost , thereby avoiding intolerable peaks of demand ( and hence atco workload ) , as well as to balance the demands on all cells , thereby avoiding unacceptable dips of demand and unfair discrepancies between demands on the cells .",
    "there are many ways of modifying flight plans and defining the cost of such changes , and we postpone that discussion for a paragraph , so as not to disturb the presentation of the general objective .",
    "we are here only interested in aircraft that follow planned routes , rather than performing free flight .",
    "the tactical rolling - horizon scenario considered is as follows . at a given moment ,",
    "suitably called @xmath11 below , the ( possibly human ) demand - capacity manager queries the predicted traffic demands under the given flight plans for the cells of the entire ecac airspace over a time interval that is some @xmath12 to @xmath13 minutes long and starts some @xmath4 hours after @xmath11 . a look - ahead much below @xmath4 hours",
    "would not give enough time for the implementation of some of the necessary re - planning .",
    "a look - ahead much beyond @xmath4 hours would incur too much uncertainty in trajectory prediction ( due to unpredictable weather conditions , say ) , and hence in demand prediction .",
    "if there are demand peaks , dips , or discrepancies that warrant interference , then the demand - capacity manager launches a re - planning process that suitably modifies the current flight plans .",
    "this process is to be repeated around the clock . for this to work",
    ", the time spent on re - planning should be very short , and the implementation effort of the modified plan should be offset by the resulting demand reductions and re - balancing among the cells .",
    "we now come to the announced discussion of how flight plans can be modified and how the cost of such changes can be defined . in this paper",
    ", we only consider _ ground holding _ , that is the changing of the take - off time of a not yet airborne flight , with the rest of its plan shifted forward accordingly .",
    "for instance , the eec suggested that our first experiments should allow ground holding by an integer amount of minutes within the range @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "hence the total cost of such flight plan modifications could be the total delay incurred by all ground holding , and this cost is to be minimised .",
    "our _ assumption _ here is that take - off times can be controlled with an accuracy of one minute , which is realistic nowadays . under this choice",
    ", a _ flight plan _ for a given flight @xmath15 is reduced to a time - ordered sequence of pairs @xmath16 , indicating that @xmath15 enters cell @xmath17 at time @xmath18 .",
    "also , a modified flight plan is then obtained by adding a delay @xmath19 $ ] to all the cell entry times of the original flight plan of @xmath15 , hence there is a decision variable @xmath19 \\in [ 0,\\dots,120]$ ] for every flight @xmath15 of the original set of flight plans .",
    "other flight plan modifications are discussed in the discussion of future work in section  [ sect : concl ] .    in reality",
    ", there is another objective function , as the traffic demands on the cells should also be balanced over time and space . at the time of writing , it is not known yet how to combine any balancing cost with the ground holding cost into a single objective function , so we will just experiment with them separately . quantifying the balancing cost may be done in many different ways , and we have decided to start with the standard deviation of the demands on the @xmath9 cells .    in short , the _ optimisation problem _ of the present work can now be stated as follows : given a set @xmath20 of flight plans , a set @xmath21 of airspace cells , and three moments @xmath22 in time , return a modification ( only by ground holding ) of @xmath20 of minimal cost , such that the traffic demands on the cells of @xmath21 never exceed their capacities within the time interval @xmath23 $ ] . in practice ,",
    "an allocated amount @xmath24 of iterations is also given , and we want the best such flight plan modifications that can be computed within @xmath24 iterations .",
    "this paper makes the following main _",
    "contributions_. to our knowledge , this is the first time that multi - sector planning is attempted on the entire european airspace ( and with even many more than the present @xmath25 flights per day ) and the first time that cbls is applied to an atm problem .",
    "we plan to make our constraints and objective functions progressively more realistic : see the discussion of related and future work in section  [ sect : concl ] .",
    "the rest of this paper is organised as follows . in section  [",
    "sect : model ] , we summarise a constraint program modelling the dynamic demand - capacity balancing problem in a multi - sector - planning framework . in section  [ sect : exp ] , we report on the experiments we made with that program . finally , in section  [ sect : concl ] , we conclude , discuss related work , and outline future work .",

    "is made on the raw instance data , which consists of a possibly very large set of flight plans .",
    "the following notation is used to express the pre - processing and model , all times being expressed as integer amounts of minutes since some common origin : @xmath26 with the capacity constraint to be enforced every @xmath18 minutes within the time interval @xmath23 $ ] for re - planning , the number of flights entering a given cell has to be measured over a sliding window of @xmath27 minutes that overlaps with @xmath23 $ ] . sliding window @xmath28 ( where @xmath29 ) is the right - open time interval defined by ( see figure  [ fig : slidingwindows ] ) : @xmath30 that is @xmath31 ,   @xmath32 ,   etc , until @xmath33 .",

    "the _ unknown _",
    "part of that demand depends on the amount of ground holding imposed on the relevant _ waiting _ flights .",

    "all delays are set to @xmath46 in the initial assignment , as we want to ground - hold as few flights as possible .",

    "the sum of the reified memberships for all such flights is the unknown demand on @xmath17 during @xmath28 ; augmented with the known demand @xmath43 $ ] , the obtained _ total demand _ must never exceed the capacity ( of the cell ) .",
    "hence there would be as many as @xmath49 constraints of the form  ( [ atmost_constraint ] ) , each involving @xmath50 decision variables and as many reified interval membership constraints for the sliding window @xmath28 .",
    "however , on the ecac airspace , @xmath51 easily goes into the thousands under the current values of the problem parameters .",
    "fortunately , in practice , it is possible to remove about @xmath52 of these constraints without losing any feasible solutions .",
    "indeed , the constraints involving at most @xmath53 flights can be removed , since their total demand can not exceed @xmath53 ( recall that the total demand includes the unknown demand of the relevant waiting flights , which may or may not be ground - held sufficiently so as to enter the considered cell at the considered sliding window ) . in other words , the constraint  ( [ atmost_constraint ] ) can safely be replaced by : @xmath54 + { \\mathit{|{\\mathit{sf_r}}\\cup { \\mathit{pf_r}}| } } > { \\mathit{cap}}\\\\      \\textbf{then}~      p[r , c ] +      \\sum_{f \\in { \\mathit{sf_r}}\\cup { \\mathit{pf_r } } }      { \\color{red } ( } e_{f , c}+{\\mathit{deltat}}[f ] \\in { \\mathit{s_r}}{\\color{red } ) } \\leq { \\mathit{cap}}\\end{array}\\ ] ] the model can further be shrunk by removing all the relevant cells that are only entered by relevant airborne flights .",

    "we devised a heuristic with three states , and the search procedure may switch states while making moves .",
    "this heuristic is quite involved , but it gives better results than the other approaches we tried , including satisfaction with generic tabu search , variable neighbourhood search , variable - depth neighbourhood search , and weighted optimisation . among these approaches ,",
    "only satisfaction with generic tabu search was faster ; however it could not minimise the objective function better than our three - state heuristic .",

    "indeed , previous studies as well as discussions with cfmu and aircraft operators have shown that it is preferable to have many flights with short delays than a few flights with long delays of the same sum . in our heuristic , we make use of this feature to narrow down the neighbourhood by first selecting a delay @xmath67 in the domain @xmath45 $ ] and then looking for the flight @xmath15 that achieves the largest violation decrease if @xmath19 $ ] is assigned @xmath67",
    ". the selection process of @xmath67 can not be random : it should follow the exponential probability to force the variables to fit best into the expected solution .",
    "we can define the required exponential probability distribution function by dividing the geometric series by the sum of its term : @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the powers of the first and last terms in the geometric series , respectively ; these values set the _ scale _ of the probability distribution .",

    "+ + + + + + + +    constraint - based local search ( cbls ) offers a very effective medium for _ modelling _ and efficiently _ solving _ the problem of optimally balancing the traffic demands on an airspace of adjacent cells , while ensuring that their capacity constraints are never violated .",
    "the demand on a cell is here defined as the hourly number of flights entering it .",
    "the currently only allowed form of re - planning is the changing of the take - off times of not yet airborne flights .",
    "experiments with projected european flight plans of the year 2030 show that this can already lead to significant demand reductions and re - balancing at little cost .",
    "ultimately , we hope to show that eurocontrol can gain from a tight integration of planning and control .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , currently flight planning is made globally by its cfmu unit a long time in advance but without achieving optimal flow and under data estimates that are almost certainly incorrect , whereas flight control is made locally by its atcc units when more precise data is available but without a global view , so that nave re - planning takes place .",
    "a manifestation of this lack of integration of planning and control is that the delays reported in table  [ tab : results ] and figure  [ fig : histogram ] would seem quite unacceptable ( for instance , about @xmath97 of the flights incur at least @xmath12 minutes of delay ) .",
    "this is due to the poor cell demand distribution of the input flight plans ( see table  [ tab : stats ] ) and is thus an argument for the proposed tighter integration of planning and control .",
    "our previous project  @xcite with eurocontrol headquarters in brussels ( belgium ) is here extended from five airspace sectors ( covering a bit more than the three benelux countries ) to the entire ecac airspace , divided into box - shaped cells rather than the current sectorisation , and ( initially ) using capacity as a metric rather than some form of air - traffic complexity .",
    "since this is a very large jump in the size of the input data , and since the technique to be developed even has to cope in real time with traffic volumes of the year 2030 ( about @xmath79 flights per day , as opposed to the @xmath25 flights nowadays ) , our first idea was to use cbls instead of the traditional constraint programming ( by heuristic - guided global tree search with propagation at every node explored ) that we deployed in the previous project .",
    "since the chosen cbls modelling language , namely _ comet _ , also has constraint programming ( by global search ) and integer programming back - ends , we plan to keep the model and evaluate the actual necessity of this choice .",
    "the works closest to ours were tested on actual flight data of the year 1995 for all of france  @xcite and the year 1999 for one french atcc  @xcite .",
    "in further contrast to our present work ( which was tested on projected flight data of the year 2030 for the entire ecac airspace , divided into uniform cells rather than sectors ) , traditional constraint programming ( rather than cbls ) was used toward satisfying the capacity constraints of all sectors , and the objective of the latter work was to minimise the maximum of all the imposed ground holdings ( rather than their sum ) .",
    "another important related work concerns the airspace of the usa @xcite .",
    "the main differences with our work are as follows .",
    "they have ( at least initially ) static lists of alternative routes to pick from for each flight and do not consider changing the time plans , whereas we currently only dynamically modify time plans .",
    "their sector workload constraints limit the average number of flights in a sector over a given time interval ( like our demand ) but also the number of pips .",
    "no multi - sector planning is performed to reduce and re - balance the workloads of contiguous sectors . however , a notion of airline equity is introduced toward a collaborative decision - making process between the faa and the airlines .",
    "finally , there is related work on minimising costs when holding flights ( on the ground or in the air ) , if not re - routing them , in the face of dynamically changing weather conditions @xcite .",
    "the main differences with our work are as follows .",
    "their objective is cost reduction for airlines and airports , whereas our work is airspace oriented .",
    "they consider ground holding and air holding , whereas we currently only consider ground holding .",
    "their dynamic re - routing is on the projected two - dimensional plane , whereas we do not re - route yet .",
    "their sector workload constraints limit the number of flights in a sector at any given time ( this is called sector _ load _",
    "below ) , but there is no multi - sector planning .",
    "a lot of related work is about dealing with potentially interacting pairs ( pips ) of flights ( see  @xcite for instance ) .",
    "however , this is an operational issue , whereas our work is at the tactical level , so we do not have to worry about the number of pips in the modified flight plans and hence we do not enforce any aircraft separation constraints .    as this brief overview of related work shows",
    ", the whole problem of optimal airspace and airport usage by the airlines is very complex , and only facets thereof are being explored in each project .",
    "our work intends to reveal some new facets , such as multi - sector planning .      at present , this work is only a feasibility study , and this induced some simplifications in our experiments .",
    "for instance , the cells in our grid should have different capacities ( rather than the uniform @xmath10 we experimented with ) , just like the current sectors , which have roughly the same traffic volumes .",
    "indeed , demand balancing under equal capacities does not make much sense , witness for instance low - level cells in areas without airports .",
    "however , our model can now be used to fine - tune the individual cell capacities .",
    "we must add side constraints to the current trunk of only capacity constraints in order to make things more realistic .",
    "for instance , since the re - planning happens for a time interval in the future , constraints will be needed to make sure no unacceptable traffic demand is generated _ before _ that interval .",
    "additional constraints are also needed to make sure that the flight plan modifications can be implemented sufficiently quickly and cheaply , and that doing so is still offset by the resulting demand reductions and re - balancing among cells .",
    "for instance , the number of flights affected by the changes may have to be kept under a given threshold .",
    "this is where airlines and pilots will probably have to be factored in .",
    "our constraint model does not enforce any notion of first - planned - first - served , which is a goal for cfmu and the faa , since the delays would then become very huge .",
    "we will investigate situations where such a fairness notion can be applied nevertheless .",
    "capacity ( the maximum number of hourly flights that may enter a portion of airspace ) is not the only metric we can enforce ( under a given time step ) .",
    "another common atm metric is _ load _ , namely the maximum number of flights that can be simultaneously present in the portion of airspace . in a previous study  @xcite",
    ", it was concluded that load constraints lead to less total delay than capacity constraints . ultimately , a _ workload _",
    "metric should be used ( as in our  @xcite ) , estimating the traffic complexity as it is perceived by air - traffic controllers .",
    "many other forms of flight re - planning can be imagined beyond the ground holding we here experimented with , such as the vertical re - routing of flights along the planned 2d route , the horizontal 2d re - routing along alternative routes ( from a list of fixed or dynamically calculated routes ) , accelerations and decelerations , and air holding .",
    "the cost function has to be adapted accordingly .",
    "such additional forms of re - planning should only be introduced if they are warranted by additional cost gains and by computational feasibility .",
    "there is a lot of other future work to do before an early prototype like ours can be deployed in a tactical context .",
    "its main current objective is therefore research strategic , namely to provide a platform where new metrics can readily be experimented with , and where constraints and objective functions can readily be changed or added .",
    "this motivated the choice of constraint programming as implementation technology , since the maintenance of constraint programs is simplified compared to ad hoc programs .",
    "this work has been co - financed by the european organisation for the safety or air navigation ( eurocontrol ) under its care ino iii programme ( grant 08 - 121447-c ) .",
    "the content of the paper does not necessarily reflect the official position of eurocontrol on the matter .",
    "many thanks to franck ballerini , marc bisiaux , marc dalichampt , hamid kadour , and serge manchon at the eurocontrol experimental centre for the definition of the problem , the data - set used , and the feedback on our progress .",
    "special thanks to the reviewers for pointing out many ways to improve the presentation of this paper ."
