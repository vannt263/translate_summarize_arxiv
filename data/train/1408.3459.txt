    "the hartree - fock ( hf ) method@xcite is one of the most important quantum chemistry techniques as it provides the mathematical setting for the chemist s notion of molecular orbitals widely used in organic chemistry . while this method is known to be a weak approximation in many cases ( e.g.  in strongly correlated systems such as transition metal complexes , at non - equilibrium geometries , etc . )",
    ", it serves also the basis for more sophisticated ( post - hartree - fock ) algorithms which improve the mean - field wave function obtained .",
    "moreover , the self - consistent field ( scf ) methodology used to finding the hartree - fock ground - state solution is also applied to solve kohn - sham density functional theory .    for practitioners of quantum chemistry , the runtime of the hartree - fock algorithm method",
    "is often dominated by the time needed to form and diagonalize the fock matrix at each iteration leading to a third order scaling in the size of the basis set .",
    "linear scaling methods  @xcite avoid diagonalization entirely and rely on localization properties of the system that may not generally exist in three - dimensional systems .",
    "regardless , these methods have yet to mature to the point where they can supplant ordinary implementations . typical approaches to improving scf are based on direct inversion of the iterative subspace@xcite , level shifting@xcite , quadratically convergent newton - raphson techniques @xcite , semidefinite programming@xcite or varying fractional occupation numbers@xcite among many other approaches .",
    "the success of these approaches depends on the specific situation and the parameters chosen ( e.g.  the size of the iterative subspace ) and often work well in combination .",
    "the success of these various methods has led to attempts to build black - box scf procedures.@xcite    unfortunately , these methods can not work efficiently in all cases since it was shown that hartree - fock is np - complete.@xcite in this article , we expand upon the previous findings using translational symmetry to examine easy and hard instances when enforcing or breaking the symmetry of the underlying hamiltonian .",
    "let us note here that the translational invariance of the @xmath0-body hamiltonian does not imply that the hartree - fock state also carries this symmetry.@xcite in general , when variational anstze give lowest energy state without the same symmetry as the true wave function , this is called a symmetry broken solution .",
    "the choice between the variational state with correct symmetries or the symmetry broken state is often referred to as _",
    "lwdin s dilemma_.@xcite taking this into account , we will give examples of 1 ) translationally invariant hf systems that are np - complete in the symmetry - broken space but are trivially simple when enforcing symmetry and 2 ) translationally invariant hf systems that are np - complete also when the symmetry is enforced .",

    "as discussed in section [ sec : npspin ] , the ground state problem for this set of models is np - complete .    in the following , we will define a set of translation - invariant fermionic models whose ground state problem can be mapped to the above ising ground state problem , and vice versa .",
    "moreover , our mapping will ensure that for each instance at least one of the ground states is a slater determinant corresponding to the solution of the given spin glass .",
    "this will imply that the corresponding hartree - fock energy decision problem is np - complete .",
    "interestingly , it will also turn out that by restricting the trial states to translationally invariant slater determinants , the restricted hf problem becomes trivial and thus no longer np - complete .",
    "we will embed an arbitrary instance of the np - complete ising problem on the @xmath33 lattice to a hf problem , by constructing a fermionic embedding hamiltonian over @xmath39 modes with the following form : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a fixed set of nearest neighbor couplings defining the original problem and the @xmath42 s denote the fourier transformed fermion operators , as defined in  eq .",

    "@xmath43 is translation - invariant if and only if @xmath44 the hamiltonian is translationally invariant .",
    "following the standard methods of hartree - fock , we will assume a fixed particle number .",
    "in the present case it will be _ half filling _ , i.e. , the number of electrons in the system will be half the number of orbitals . however , we will work in the second quantized formalism ( not constraining the number of particles ) and only apply the half filling condition in the course of the proof .",
    "let us consider first the case when we restrict the hf problem of eq .",

    "these two statements imply that for all translationally invariant slater determinants , with or without half filling , @xmath49 .",
    "hence , this restricted hf ground state problem is trivial .",
    "next we will show that , contrary to the previous case , the _ non - restricted _ hartree - fock problem is np - complete .",

    "( [ eq : h2_alt ] ) are similar to those found in the orbital pair pseudo - spin mapping originally used to prove that hartree - fock is np - complete.@xcite however , the present mapping differs in an important way : unlike the previous construction , we do not need an additional penalty term in the hamiltonian to enforce the orbital pairing condition , as will be clear from the discussion below .",
    "since the @xmath53 and @xmath54 orbitals are orthogonal , we can immediately write all @xmath57 eigenstates of eq .",

    "( [ eq : h ] ) ) , as @xmath58 with energies , @xmath59 since the modes @xmath60 do not carry the underlying translational symmetry of the hamiltonian , neither will the eigenstates @xmath61 inherit this symmetry ( except for some degenerate cases as the vacuum and the completely filled state ) .    the ground state energy of eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) is thus the minimum value attained by eq .",
    "( [ eq : energy ] ) . to demonstrate that this minimum and the ground state energy of the ising spin glass of eq .",
    "( [ eq : target ] ) are in correspondence , we will first give a lower bound on eq .",
    "( [ eq : energy ] ) , which relies on bipartite graph properties , and then we show that the _ orbital paired state _ corresponding to the solution of the ising spin glass has exactly an energy saturating this lower bound .    as the @xmath62 rectangular lattice is a bipartite lattice , one can label alternating spins even and odd such that no two spins with the same label share interactions .",
    "the labeling then corresponds to a bipartition of the lattice .",
    "the relevant property of bipartite lattices is that the energy spectrum of an ising spin glass is symmetric . to prove that the largest energy , @xmath63 is equal to @xmath64",

    "this implies that @xmath72 as we intended .    in eq .",
    "( [ eq : energy ] ) , there are four terms .",
    "the first two have minimal energy @xmath71 and the second two have energy at least @xmath73 . it follows , using @xmath72 , that the minimal energy configuration of eq .",

    "( [ eq : h ] ) using the orbital pair scheme as @xmath76 with @xmath77 .",
    "this state is at half - filling and , due to the bipartite nature of the underlying lattice , it attains the energy @xmath74 , thus this must be a ground state .",
    "this means that the hartree - fock energy problem for eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) is equivalent to finding the lowest energy for an ising spin glass , and hence it is np - complete .",

    "we will now turn to a set of hamiltonians where the hartree - fock problem is np - complete even when we restrict ourselves to translationally invariant slater determinants .",
    "we will again like to assume a fixed particle number , more concretely half filling .",
    "as the usual embedding of spins into fermions maps the number of electrons to number of ` up ' spins , we have to build up ising models where the ground state has zero magnetization .",
    "in the present example this will be done by introducing an ising gadget similar to the pair - orbital construction used to map spin systems to fermionic systems.@xcite the idea is to fix the zero magnetization by introducing pairs of spins @xmath82 and @xmath83 to represent single spin @xmath37 in the original ising spin glass system .",
