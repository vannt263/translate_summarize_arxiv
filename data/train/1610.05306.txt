    "the diffuse flux of tev - pev neutrinos detected with icecube indicates extraterrestrial neutrino emission from cosmic accelerators @xcite of yet unknown nature . among the prime source candidates are blazars , active galactic nuclei ( agn ) featuring a relativistic jet roughly oriented along the line of sight to the observer . there is a rich literature modeling the neutrino emission from blazars and searching for positional and temporal correlations between the icecube neutrino events and blazars ( see _ e.g. _  refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , as well as studying diffuse neutrino emission @xcite .",
    "blazars significantly contribute to the diffuse ( extragalactic ) @xmath0-ray background  @xcite .",
    "if these @xmath0-rays originate from proton interactions , the energy budget will be in principle sufficient to account for the intensity of icecube neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "however , recent stacking analyses using icecube data suggest that agn blazars at most contribute 7 - 27% of the observed neutrino intensity  @xcite . similar arguments apply to other promising source candidates , such as starburst galaxies  @xcite and gamma - ray bursts  @xcite . while the origin of the astrophysical neutrinos is still unknown , the known constraints still permit that at least about ten percent of the observed neutrinos were produced by blazars  @xcite , possibly even by a few particularly neutrino - bright blazars",
    ". moreover , the information presented in different analyses seems partially contradictory , suggesting that substantial systematic uncertainties arise from generic assumptions concerning the spectral shape of the neutrino spectrum and the weighting schemes relating the neutrino luminosity to the @xmath0-ray luminosity .",
    "blazars typically exhibit a two - hump structure in their spectral energy distribution ( sed )  @xcite .",
    "this structure has been successfully reproduced by both leptonic and hadronic models for a number of blazars  @xcite . in a leptonic model ,",
    "the low - energy and high - energy humps of the sed are produced by the synchrotron emission from electrons and the inverse - compton scatter of soft photons ( such as synchrotron photons from the same electrons ) , respectively . in a hadronic model ,",
    "the primary electron - synchrotron generates the low - energy hump as well , but secondaries from hadronic processes induced by @xmath1 interactions are responsible for the @xmath0-ray emission . in the simplest cases , it is frequently used that in @xmath1 interactions the energy deposited in neutrinos ( from @xmath2 decays ) is roughly comparable to that of @xmath0-rays ( from @xmath3 decays ) , which means that the neutrino and @xmath0-ray fluxes are directly correlated .",
    "note , however , that even in hadronic models , the leading mechanism to generate the second hump may be , for instance , synchrotron radiation of secondary electrons produced by the photohadronic interactions .",
    "in addition , it may be possible that for certain astrophysical objects the emission in the second hump must be dominated by processes of purely leptonic origin .",
    "the study of this direct correlation is therefore the main motivation of this work .",
    "one interesting test case for the direct neutrino@xmath0-ray correlation is the flat - spectrum radio quasar ( fsrq ) pks b1424 - 418 . in @xcite , a positional and temporal coincidence between the 2-pev neutrino event ( icecube event 35 , ic35 , or `` big bird '' ) and a burst of pks b1424 - 418",
    "was reported . after analyzing the @xmath0-ray fluences from blazars in the positional - uncertainty region of ic35 as well as the diffuse @xmath0-ray emission ,",
    "it was concluded that the burst of pks b1424 - 418 had sufficient energy to account for the icecube event , while the probability of a chance coincidence was around @xmath4 .",
    "the required neutrino production efficiency was obtained by scaling the measured neutrino output to the @xmath0-ray fluence in the energy range from @xmath5 to @xmath6 ( @xmath7@xmath8 ) and found consistent with that theoretically expected on the grounds of flavor , spectral effects , and source - population selection .",
    "an important ingredient was the assumption that the sed in that respective energy range were of hadronic origin , implying our direct correlation .",
    "we study if this assumption can be maintained in a self - consistent ansatz .",
    "note that while we focus on one astrophysical object in this study , our conclusions will be more profound , as this direct correlation is widely used in multi - messenger analyses , see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite .",
    "hadronic model of blazars typically involve many parameters @xcite , even in the simplest case : a parameter set for primary electrons , a set for protons , and a set for the bulk features of the emitting region , such as size ( radius ) , magnetic - field strength , and doppler factor , since none of these can be robustly derived from first principles or direct observations .",
    "the characteristics for the seds vary greatly among the blazars @xcite , and therefore the best - fit parameters , even for purely leptonic models , exhibit large variations ; an example are the leptonic models @xcite versus @xcite for pks b1424 - 418 .",
    "most neutrinos are produced in @xmath1 interactions near the @xmath1 threshold , and therefore the neutrino yield strongly depends on the density and spectrum of target photons . even the simple assumption used in many studies , namely @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 ( see _ e.g._@xcite ) , is questionable , and an accurate and self - consistent calculation of the sed and the neutrino spectrum is necessary .",
    "the calculation also needs to be efficient to permit scanning a large parameter space . in this paper",
    "we present such a code and use it together with analytical calculations to explore what kind of model and which model parameters provide a consistent description of both the sed and the rate of pev neutrinos .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "[ ana ] we introduce the general setup , and we use analytical calculations to determine the kind of model viable for pks b1424 - 418 ; in sec .",
    "[ num ] we introduce our numerical methods ( see also app .",
    "[ app : num ] ) and we present the results : the quality of the sed fit , the likelihood of having the observed neutrino event , and the corresponding parameters .",
    "we use cgs units throughout the paper , unless specified otherwise .",
    "all primed quantities are expressed in the blob - comoving frame .",
    "in this section we broadly list possible models and give generic constraints based on the characteristics of the sed for the source . the conclusions are derived using analytical and semi - analytical methods .",
    "we use a one - zone model consisting of an isotropic , homogeneous and spherical emission region , or blob , with radius @xmath12 , that moves relativistically with doppler factor @xmath13 .",
    "electrons and protons are injected with power - law spectra , @xmath14 for @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the differential particle injection rate per volume , @xmath17 the power - law index , @xmath18 and @xmath19 the minimum and maximum lorentz factor of the particles , and @xmath20 is a normalization factor determined by the particle injection luminosity , @xmath21 .",
    "the injected electrons are henceforth referred to as primary electrons , whereas we denote as secondary electrons those created by hadronic interactions or @xmath22 pair production .",
    "we allow primary electrons and protons to have separate parameter values for @xmath21 , @xmath23 , @xmath19 , and @xmath17 .",
    "the emission region is assumed to be filled with a homogeneous , randomly oriented magnetic field of strength @xmath24 .",
    "neutrinos and `` optically - thin '' photons can freely stream out of the blob on the timescale @xmath25 .",
    "for simplicity , we assume the escape rate for charged particles , in the slow cooling case , to be a fixed multiple of the free - streaming timescale , @xmath26 .. note that to some degree , the effect of energy - dependent escape can be compensated with an appropriate choice of the free parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the hadronic interactions are unaffected since the target - photon distribution remains the same then . ]",
    "the list of relevant interactions includes synchrotron emission and synchrotron self - absorption ( ssa ) , inverse compton ( ic ) scattering by both electrons and protons , @xmath22 pair production and annihilation , bethe - heitler photo - pair production @xmath29 ( bh ) , and photo - hadronic ( @xmath1 ) interactions ( @xmath30 ) , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 denotes either a proton or a neutron and @xmath33 includes charged or neutral pions .",
    "secondary particles such as @xmath2 and @xmath34 can in principle radiate before they decay , but for the parameter values relevant to this study the effect is negligible .",
    "the low - frequency hump in the sed of a generic blazar extends from the radio band to the uv and in some cases even to the x - ray band ; the high - frequency component can be observed from x - rays up to tev @xmath0-rays .",
    "here we discuss four scenarios that may in principle account for shape of the sed : the pure leptonic ( ssc ) model , the lepto - hadronic synchrotron - self - compton ( lh - ssc ) model , the lepto - hadronic pion ( lh@xmath33 ) model and the proton synchrotron ( psyn ) model , which is a purely hadronic model .",
    "the defining features of these models are summarized in tab .",
    "[ modellist ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the the x - ray band , seen as the gap between the two humps in the sed ,",
    "is explained by either leptonic ssc ( for ic-3yr phase ) or hadronic interactions ( for 2lac , burst ) . in the latter case , secondary emission depends on the detailed processing of the electromagnetic cascades in the source , mainly via the following channels : @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 . in the @xmath3 channel ,",
    "the emission predominantly comes from the first generation of pairs .",
    "the source itself becomes optically thick for @xmath0-rays above roughly 100 tev .",
    "it can be further estimated @xcite that the spectrum above @xmath38 gev will suffer from additional suppression due to absorption by ebl , but this effect does not play a significantly role in our fitting .",
    "we list the detailed fit parameters and expected number of neutrino events during the different phases in tab .",
    "[ resulttable ] .",
    "we notice that similar leptonic parameters are found for the 2lac , ic-3yr and burst phases .",
    "this suggests that the modeling of the burst phase can be simply achieved by a slight variation of the magnetic field strength , a slight hardening on the electron injection spectrum , or an increase of the proton injection luminosity .",
    "the bulk lorentz factor , magnetic field values and the blob radius are consistent with the estimates in eqs .",
    "( [ equ : sscconstraint])-([equ : sscconstraintb ] ) .",
    "the spectral index for the power - law injection of primary @xmath39 is close to @xmath40 .",
    "the sed and neutrino joint best - fit predicts 0.15 and 0.3 neutrino events in the @xmath41 pev bins of icecube during the ic-3yr and burst phases , respectively . within the entire 3@xmath42-confidence regions of the sed fits , up to @xmath43",
    "@xmath44pev neutrino events are found during either phase , or about a @xmath4 chance to have the observed neutrino pattern in icecube ( one 2-pev event and none in other bins ) . during the 2lac phase , within the 3@xmath42 constraints ,",
    "we expect at most @xmath45 neutrino events above 0.5 pev .",
    "the proton - to - lepton luminosity ratio required to fit the neutrino result is large , of the order of @xmath46@xmath47 ( @xmath48 for the 2lac case ) .",
    "this value is coincidently similar to that found for other blazars , such as @xcite . in our case , on one hand the p@xmath0 interaction rate is lower than those in the above cases and more protons are needed to achieve the same level of @xmath49rays ; on the other hand , compared to their lh@xmath50 models , we only need a subdominant hadronic contribution to @xmath49rays , which lowers the requirement for proton luminosity .",
    "the physical proton - injection luminosity needed for the case roughly equals the eddington luminosity in the ic-3yr phase and becomes super - eddington in the burst phase .",
    "this requirement can be alleviated if we assume a lower escape rate for protons , _",
    "e.g. _  a magnetic configuration that can trap the protons longer in the blob . in our model , due to the low @xmath1 efficiency , most protons simply escape without having a @xmath1 interaction .",
    "therefore , the required @xmath51 scales linearly with the escape rate .",
    "a potential correlation between the pev neutrino event `` big bird '' by icecube in 2012 and the burst phase of fsrq pks b1424 - 418 was reported by @xcite .",
    "that analysis relies on the frequently used assumption @xmath52 . in this paper",
    "we have revisited this important relationship with a self - consistent one - zone emission model , with seds measured from three phases of the source : 2lac ( 2008.8 - 2010.9 ) , icecube 3-year ( ic-3yr , 2010.5 - 2013.5 ) and burst phase ( 2012.5 - 2013.3 ) .",
    "those different seds can be interpreted in our results as variations on blazar properties over time .",
    "we have also studied the parameter values needed to attribute to the neutrino event , which was observed in the ic-3yr phase and within that , the burst phase .",
    "we found that the `` conventional '' hadronic model ( high energy hump by emissions from secondaries via hadronic processes ; the `` lh-@xmath33 '' model ) does not work for this blazar , which is different from many other blazars , such as the well - studied mrk 421 @xcite , for which the high - energy hump of sed can be fully accounted for by hadronic processes .",
    "therefore , the leading contribution to the sed of pks b1424 - 418 must be leptonic .",
    "we have , however , shown that a subdominant hadronic contribution can be present . in terms of neutrino production , it is therefore an interesting question how much baryonic loading can be tolerated , even in an ssc model , without affecting the shape of the sed .",
    "we have found that the observed one neutrino event reported by @xcite during the burst phase is in tension with the sed fits , whereas up to @xmath53 above - pev events are acceptable . the probability to produce 0 , 1 , and 0 neutrinos in the @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 pev bins , respectively , as observed by icecube , is up to @xmath4 in both the ic-3yr and the burst phase .",
    "this suggests a chance coincidence of the observed pev - event with the burst phase of pks b1424 - 418 , since there is a substantial probability for it to occur at any other time of the icecube 3-year observation .",
    "our predicted event rates are consistent with @xcite if their expectation is corrected for small fraction of the photon energy flux in the second peak comes from hadronic processes .",
    "this means that an additional `` theory correction factor '' has to be applied if the gamma - ray and neutrino fluxes are to be correlated , which can only come from self - consistent models .",
    "we have also demonstrated from independent simulations of the different phases of the blazar that a self - consistent time - dependent evolution picture can be drawn , meaning that the different phases can be described by similar parameters .",
    "we noted that the active state ( burst phase ) can host a larger hadronic loading than quiescent phase ( ic-3yr ) .",
    "this may as well due to the availability of additional data points during the latter phase , which provides stronger constraints for the fit .    while our results apply to pks b1424 - 418 specifically , we emphasize the importance of a self - consistent description of the sed as opposed to to generic approaches relating the gamma - ray and neutrino luminosities .",
    "the studied blazar serves as a counter - example for the direct correlation of these , which means that this assumption does not hold in general and has to be used with care .",
    "we have also presented an example in a quantitative way on how the neutrino observation , even with one candidate event , is able to break the degeneracies of blazar models .",
