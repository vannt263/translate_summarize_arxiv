    "dust polarization observations in the mm / submm continuum reveal plane - of - sky projected magnetic field morphologies . here , dust grains are expected to be aligned with their shorter axes parallel to the magnetic field , thus the detected polarized emission is perpendicular to the b field . despite the recent growing observations , e.g. , carma ( hull _ et al . _",

    "@xcite ) , magnetic field strengths can unfortunately not be directly inferred from these observed magnetic field morphologies . through a series of publications ( koch _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) we introduced @xmath0  the local angle between an observed magnetic field orientation and the gradient of the underlying dust continuum stokes @xmath1 emission ( figure [ example_delta ] ) . with the help of a magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) force equation , @xmath0 can be interpreted as a magnetic field alignment factor , where @xmath2 measures the fraction of the magnetic field tension force that is directed along an emission ( density ) gradient .",
    "we demonstrate clear systematic features found in @xmath3 across two regions observed with the sma at 345 ghz ( qiu _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) in figure [ example_delta ] .",
    "strikingly , higher - resolution observations with the sma at 1.3 mm ( qiu _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) show condensations along a mid - plane in g240.31 + 0.07 where @xmath3 is maximised , with regions above and below this mid - plane showing small @xmath3-values that allow the material to be channelled to the mid - plane .",
    "opposite trends in @xmath3 structures are seen in g35.2 - 0.74n .",
    "visually , these sources can clearly be categorised as type iia ( g240 ) and iib ( g35.2n ) as described below .",

    "_ @xcite ; cso , dotson _",
    "@xcite ) most of the sources show systematic features in @xmath3 as soon as polarization is detected over a large enough area .",
    "our sample covers both low- and high - mass star - formation sites over scales of 0.1 to 0.01  pc ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 m ; sma ) and larger scales around 1pc ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 m ; cso ) .",
    "figure [ hist_delta ] shows histograms for the source - averaged @xmath10 ( 50 data points ) and for @xmath3 ( based on 4000 independent beams across all 50 sources ) .",
    "the @xmath3-histogram of each source is normalized first before co - adding , in order to avoid the statistics being dominated by sources with the largest numbers of independent beams .",
    "both histograms show a broad shoulder peaking around small @xmath10 and @xmath3 , falling off with a tail towards larger values .",
    "this indicates that the prevailing source - magnetic field orientation statistically prefers small misalignments with the emission gradient .",
    "thus , magnetic fields are found to be more often within small deviations of a source minor axis .",
    "histograms for the source - averaged @xmath10 ( left panel , 50 sources ) and @xmath3 ( right panel , about 4000 independent measurements from all 50 sources ) .",
    "color - coded in red , blue and black are the sources that can visually easily be identified as type iia or iib , and all iia , iib and iii sources together ]    if @xmath3 is further interpreted with an mhd force equation , the ratio between the magnetic field tension force and gravity , @xmath11 , can be calculated from @xmath3 and @xmath12 as @xmath13 , where @xmath12 is the local angle between the gradient of the dust continuum and the direction of local gravity ( koch _ et al . _",
    "this finding reflects the idea that an observed molecular cloud morphology  with its characteristic angles @xmath0 and @xmath12  is a measure of the imprint of all the relevant forces in a system .",
    "figure [ sigma_b_vs_delta ] displays source - averaged force ratios @xmath14 versus source - averaged @xmath10 .",
    "the force ratio increases with growing @xmath10 .",
    "source - averaged force ratios @xmath15 vs source - averaged @xmath16 for the combined sma and cso samples .",
    "red and blue filled symbols show the visually identified iia- and iib - type sources from both the sma ( circles ) and cso ( squares ) .",
    "empty symbols correspond to sources with less clear features .",
    "black filled circles are the visually identified sma - iii sources .",
    "schematic magnetic field structures are illustrated for iia- ( red segments ) , iib- ( blue segments ) and iii - type sources ( white segments ) .",
    "white contours display the dust continuum emission .",
    "the black - to - white color grading on the top indicates the local @xmath3 .",
    "clear opposite trends are apparent for type - iia and -iib sources .",
    "the solid gray line is the log - linear best fit @xmath17 with @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the dashed and dotted gray lines indicate mean error ( @xmath20 ) and @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) bounds . ]",
    "the local angle @xmath3 is found to be a prime observable across a sample of 50 star - forming regions . it can further be linked to a magnetic field - to - gravity force ratio , @xmath11 .",
    "maps of @xmath11 are closely correlated to features in @xmath3-maps , making @xmath3 a tracer for the local role of the magnetic field . while figure [ sigma_b_vs_delta ] shows a source - averaged correlation , it is important to note that our approach also provides a local assessment of the magnetic field .",
    "thus , @xmath3 can explain where condensations , and potentially star formation , occur ( figure [ example_delta ] ) .",
    "our finding of magnetic fields being more aligned parallel to emission gradients in clouds and cores ( figure [ hist_delta ] ) connects to _ planck _ results that observe a transition from fields being parallel to ridges in the diffuse interstellar medium to more orthogonal as densities towards molecular clouds increase ( planck collaboration xxxii @xcite ) .",
