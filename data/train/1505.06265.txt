    "for many years our knowledge of the wr population of the magellanic clouds was considered  essentially \" complete ( see , e.g. , massey & johnson 1998 ) .",
    "the accidental discovery of several weak - lined wn - type wrs over the years , and our own discovery of a strong - line wo star ( neugent 2012a ) , made us realize that if we wanted an accurate value for the relative numbers of wc- , wo- , and wn - type wrs for comparing with evolutionary models , we needed to conduct a modern survey for wrs using the same techniques we had successfully applied to m33 ( neugent & massey 2011 ) and m31 ( neugent et al .",
    "we therefore began a multi - year observational program using the las campanas swope 1-m telescope to image fields in the lmc and smc through a set of interference filters centered on c  iii  @xmath1 , he  ii  @xmath2 , and neighboring continuum .",
    "candidates are identified by eye after the frames are reduced and run through image subtraction software .",
    "follow - up spectroscopic observations of the wr candidates are then carried out with the magellan 6.5-m clay telescope .",
    "the results from the first year of this project were reported by massey et al .",
    "( 2014 , paper  i ) , which further describes the motivation and our observing strategy .",
    "when we began our survey , we realized it was possible that we would find nothing very interesting . instead , with the survey only 15% complete , we had already confirmed nine newly found wrs in the lmc , a 6% increase in the total number of lmc wrs known . of these ,",
    "one was another very rare wo - type wr , only the third known in that galaxy .",
    "all of the wrs discovered since the breysacher et al .",
    "( 1999 ) catalog ( bat99 ) , including those from our survey , were of wn type ( with the exception of the two wos ) , confirming our suspicions that previous surveys had been biased towards wcs , as these stars have much stronger lines and thus are easier to find ( massey & johnson 1998 ) .",
    "most interesting , however , was that six of these newly found wn stars were unlike any other wrs previously recognized , showing a wn3-type emission spectrum combined with an o3-type absorption spectrum .",
    "we realized that these were unlikely to be true wn3+o3  v pairs .",
    "for one thing , o3  v stars are extremely rare : only a few dozen are known in all of the lmc , and the idea that six would be paired with newly found wn3s was simply not credible",
    ". it would also be impossible to understand in terms of ( single - star ) evolution : a very massive star will be in the o3  v stage only for the first million years or so of its life , but it takes 3 - 4 myr to produce a wr star .",
    "finally , and most definitively , these newly found wrs were quite faint , with @xmath3@xmath016 .",
    "they had absolute visual magnitudes @xmath4@xmath0@xmath5 , about 2.5  mags fainter than the @xmath4 of o3  v stars .",
    "in other words , these stars were impossibly faint to be wn3+o3  v binaries .",
    "we succeeded in modeling the optical spectrum of one of these stars using cmfgen ( hillier & miller 1998 ) , finding that we could reproduce the absorption _ and _ emission - line spectra with a single set of physical parameters , using an effective temperature of 100,000  k , a he / h number ratio of 1.0 , a nitrogen mass - fraction of 0.011 ( corresponding to 10@xmath6 solar using the anders & grevesse 1989 values ) , reduced carbon and oxygen abundances ( 0.05@xmath6 solar ) , and a mass - loss rate of @xmath7 yr@xmath8 , with a clumping volume filling factor of 0.1 .",
    "compared to a recent modeling study of other lmc wns by hainich et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , the 100,000 k effective temperature was at the high end of what was normally found but not anomalous , the bolometric luminosity ( @xmath9@xmath05.6 ) was at the low end , but also not anomalous , but the mass - loss rate was quite atypical , down a factor of 3 - 5@xmath6 from what we would expect ( massey et al .",
    "we are currently in the process of refining this model based upon recently acquired _ hst _ uv and magellan nir data , as well as extending our study to other wn3/o3s .",
    "we have now completed the second year of our survey , including spectroscopic follow - up of our candidates , and report here the discovery of two additional wn3/o3 stars , two newly found wr  slash stars , \" plus an odd of - type star and a peculiar emission - line star .",
    "as stated above , our interference - filter imaging was conducted using the 1-m swope telescope .",
    "the site#3 ccd camera that we used in the first year of our survey had been replaced with a new system containing a 4110@xmath64096 e2v device with 15@xmath10 m pixels .",
    "this provides a 298 ( ew ) @xmath6297 ( ns ) field of view , or 0.25 deg@xmath11 , a @xmath12 improvement over the old system .",
    "the chip is read out using four amplifiers , and so the read - time dropped from 127s with the site#3 camera to 37s with the new camera , another substantial improvement .",
    "the e2v camera is a bit more sensitive as well , although we kept to the same exposure times : 300s through each of our three interference filters .",
    "further details are given in paper i.    for calibration , we obtained ten bias frames each day , although there was very little ( @xmath131  adu ) bias structure with the new camera . with the large field of view",
    ", dome flats contained a 10% gradient , and we relied upon twilight flats for flat - fielding .",
    "we obtained 5 or more twilight sky flats through each filter during the clear nights , dithering the telescope between each exposure . if there was cirrus , we used flats from a clear night .",
    "there is a significant shutter pattern present from the iris shutter in short exposures ( 1% peak to valley in a 5s exposure ) ; in order to take advantage of rapidly fading twilight , we measured the shutter pattern using dome flats during one afternoon , and then used this pattern to correct the short twilight exposures appropriately be the ",
    "extra \" time that an iris shutter is open ( in addition to the requested exposure time ) as a function of position on the chip .",
    "( of course , @xmath14 can be negative . )",
    "assume that one has a stable and constant ( voltage - regulated ) flat - field system ( i.e. , dome",
    " white spot \" ) that illuminates the chip with a pattern s(x , y ) in counts / sec .",
    "then a 1s exposure will produce an image @xmath15 above bias . a 20s exposure will produce an image @xmath16 above bias . dividing one image by the other ( after bias removal ) will produce @xmath17 . if @xmath14 is a small fraction of a second ( either positive or negative ) , then @xmath18 .",
    "thus @xmath19 .",
    "each twilight exposure of exposure time @xmath20 can be simply corrected ( after overscan and bias subtraction ) by dividing by @xmath21 before co - adding . ] .",
    "modest corrections for non - linearity were applied to the data from each quadrant using the correction coefficients kindly provided by carlos contreras based on measurements made on august 24 , 2014 ; the corrections amount to a maximum of 2.8% , 1.1% , 0.8% , and 1.4% for the four quadrants over the full data range .",
    "we were assigned 10 nights for our second year of imaging , ( ut ) 6 - 10 sep 2014 , and 5 - 9 nov 2014 .",
    "we were also able to obtain some observations during four additional nights during engineering tests of the new camera , on 12 - 13 aug 2014 and 14 - 16 aug 2014 .",
    "the seeing was unusually poor for las campanas during several of our nights , with the result that we repeated many fields , insisting that the seeing be adequate for the crowding in a particular field , generally @xmath224.5 pixels full - width - at - half - maximum , corresponding to @xmath222 , but some fields required significantly better seeing .",
    "we also found that the image subtraction technique was badly compromised if the seeing varied by more than about 10% on the three images , and so we repeated exposures if we were not achieving this much consistency .",
    "since some data were also taken through light cirrus , we also checked the photometric zero - points on each frame using the aavso photometric all - sky survey _ b - band _ magnitudes listed in the ucac4 catalog ( zacharias et al .",
    "2013 ) , and repeated any fields that were suspect . in the end , we observed 137 new fields , 63 in the smc and 74 in the lmc , covering approximately 14.5 deg@xmath11 and 17.0 deg@xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the outlines of these fields are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : smc ] and [ fig : lmc ] in red .",
    "we also show the outlines ( in green ) of the regions observed in 2013 with the site#3 camera .",
    "there is considerable overlap : in some cases we wanted to double - check that we were doing as well as we did last year , and in other cases we wanted to re - observe a field that had been taken under poorer conditions .",
    "we calculate that the total area we have so far surveyed is 17.3 deg@xmath11 in the smc and 24.8 deg@xmath11 in the lmc , approximately 60% and and 57% of our intended survey areas in the two galaxies .",
    "we are scheduled for another 10 nights in 2015 november ; if conditions are similar , we should readily be able to complete our survey .",
    "analysis of the frames followed the same method we used in paper i , where we employed the image subtraction code high order transform of psf and template subtraction ( _ _ ) described by becker et al .",
    "the larger field of view of the camera led to some poor results in the corners , but we have enough overlap on adjacent fields that we feel this is not a practical issue .",
    "along with the image subtraction , aperture photometry was run on the frames and photometrically significant candidates were identified .",
    "the combination of the two techniques proved very valuable in identifying potential wr stars .",
    "accurate ( 05 ) coordinates were obtained by running the data through the  astrometry.net \" software ( lang et al .",
    "2010 ) locally installed on our machines .",
    "prior to attempting spectroscopic confirmation , candidates were examined through vizier to make sure they were not already known emission - line sources ; this eliminated a number of objects , mostly planetary nebulae .",
    "( we were already suspicious of these as they had no counterparts on the continuum frames . ) in addition , inspection of the candidates 2mass colors allowed us to eliminate red stars , which show up as candidates as there is a strong absorption band in the continuum filter ( see paper i as well as neugent & massey 2011 ) . in the end , we had four new candidates in the smc , 10 new candidates in the lmc , along with three additional candidates from the first year which we had not managed to observe ( all in the lmc ) .",
    "one additional lmc candidate is awaiting imaging in excellent seeing as it is rather crowded .",
    "spectroscopic followup was carried out on the 6.5-m magellan clay telescope using the magellan echellette ( mage ) spectrograph ( marshall et al .",
    "2008 ) during a single night of observing , ( ut ) 9 jan 2015 .",
    "mage provides full spectral coverage in the optical from 3100  to 1@xmath10 m at a resolving power @xmath23 of 4100 using a 1  slit .",
    "the sky was clear , and the seeing ( as reported on the guide camera ) was 07 - 10 .",
    "exposure times were typically 600 - 1200s , with a few longer and a few shorter .",
    "bias frames and various flat - field exposures ( xe - flash and dome flats ) were taken , but as described in paper i and massey & hanson ( 2013 ) , we found that we actually did better in terms of signal - to - noise ( s / n ) by _ not _ flat fielding our data , as the mage chip is quite uniform and obtaining high signal - to - noise flats over such a large wavelength regime presents quite a challenge .",
    "the individual orders were combined after flux calibration using observations of spectrophotometric standards .",
    "the data were extracted using jack baldwin s  mtools \" iraf routines , and wavelength calibrated and fluxed with the usual iraf echelle reduction tasks .",

    "one other candidate had been identified as a rr lyr variable that was detected at a high significance level .",
    "although variability could produce a false wr candidate ( if the star was fainter in the continuum exposure ) , we observed this to be sure it had been correctly identified as an rr  lyr star .",

    "we took two exposures of this field , once on ( ut ) 2014 sept 10 under poor conditions , and once on ( ut ) 2014 nov 11 .",
    "we measured lmce034 - 1 as @xmath62  mag fainter on the continuum image in the first exposure as in the second .",
    "it is also possible that the he  ii  @xmath2 emission was weaker based on the _ wn _ image , but that is harder to judge , given the poorer quality of the data .",
    "what do we make of this peculiar object ?",
    "we can rule out it being an am  her cataclysmic variable based on its radial velocity and apparent brightness .",
    "john hillier , howard bond , and nolan walborn were all kind enough to comment on the spectrum .",
    "although broad components like this are often attributed to thompson scattering , in this case the profiles look too boxy for that explanation . instead",
    ", hillier has offered the useful conjecture that we may be looking at a two - component wind .",
    "after all , the skinner component is none too skinny .",
    "a binary explanation can not be ruled out , and we will continue to monitor this star for radial velocity variations .",
    "( we saw none in two spectra separated by 5.5 hours . )",
    "nevertheless , the fact that both the broad and narrow components show up in most of the lines suggests that this is an unlikely explanation for the peculiar spectrum , regardless of whether the star is a binary ( with an unseen companion ) or not .",
    "walborn has instead noted the similarity to ngc 1624 - 2 ( wade et al .",
    "2012 ) , and has suggested that the strange profiles are due to a combination of photospheric and magetospheric components .",
    "as mentioned above , six of our candidates turned out to be normal b - type stars .",
    "these candidates were marginal , having magnitude differences between the wn and ct filters of @xmath00.1  mag or less . given the number of stars involved , our methodology is bound to produce a few false positives .",
    "we give the identifications of these b stars in table  [ tab : losers ] for completeness , but do not discuss these in detail .",
    "we were guided by the walborn & fitzpatrick ( 1990 ) atlas in the classification .",
    "lmce019 - 1 was identified as an rr lyr variable by ogle ( lmc - rrlyr-06881 ) with a maximum magnitude of @xmath63 , an amplitude of 0.8  mag , and a period of 0.5 days ( soszyski et al .",
    "our spectrum shows this to be of a - type , consistent with it being an rr lyr star .",
    "given its magnitude it really must be a star in our own halo .",
    "it was detected at a very significant level ( 14@xmath64 ) but the spectrum clearly showed no emission .",
    "the magnitude difference between the wn and ct filter was 0.3  mag .",
    "our imaging must have caught this star as it was changing brightness most rapidly .",
    "we describe here the results of our second year of surveying the magellanic clouds for wolf - rayet stars .",
    "we have covered 57 - 60% of our intended survey area , finding ( in total ) 13 new wrs in the lmc , bringing the total number of wrs known in the lmc to 152 , 8.6% of which have been found as part of our survey .",
    "what does this imply for the overall numbers ?    in the first year , our survey of the lmc concentrated on the regions where wrs were already known , both as a test of whether or not we would readily detect the known ones ( we did , other than in the most crowded regions near r136 in 30 dor ) , but also based on the principle that that is where most of the massive stars would be found . as our result , in our first year of the survey we found nine new wrs in the lmc despite surveying only 15% .",
    "thus we were not completely surprised that although we more than doubled the survey area we detected only 4 new wrs this year .",
    "we are encouraged by the fact that we are detecting many of - type stars with weaker he  ii  @xmath2 than that found in wrs .",
    "we were also encouraged that , despite the large amount of overlap with the regions surveyed in our first year , we detected nothing new in the regions we had previously surveyed .",
    "we have as yet found no new wrs in the smc , but we can argue that since there are only 12 known wrs in the smc , a similar 8.6% increase would be only 1 star , and thus our not finding any new smc wrs ( yet ) may well be due to small number statistics .    of the 13 lmc wrs we have",
    "so far found as part of our survey , 12 of these are wns .",
    "although this confirms our suspicion that previous studies have selectively missed wns because they are weaker lined , it has changed the wc+wo to wn ratio negligibly , from 0.23 ( based on the additions and demotions listed by neugent et al .",
    "2012a ) to 0.22 .",
    "it remains considerably larger than the 0.11 expected from the geneva evolutionary models computed with @xmath65 and an initial rotation of 40% of the breakup speed ( c. georgy , private communication 2012 , and used by neugent et al .",
    "what we can say is that this number is less suspect than in the past .",
    "we note that the discrepancy with the models is probably slightly larger than this , as we have included in our counts both the hot and cool  slash \" stars ; the evolutionary models can recogize surface abundances , but not the small changes in wind density that would drive h@xmath24 from pure absorption into p cygni .",
    "doubtless the most interesting thing revealed by our survey has been the 8 faint wn3 stars which show o3-type absorption spectra , what we are referring to as the wn3/o3s .",
    "these stars are faint visually , with @xmath4@xmath0@xmath66 to @xmath5 , and are much too faint ( by 2.5 - 3 mags ! ) to actually be wn3+o3  v binaries .",
    "what are these stars ? our preliminary modeling ( paper  i and massey et al .",
    "2015 ) shows that it is possible to produce the emission and absorption features with a single set of physical parameters .",
    "these stars appear to be as hot and as bolometrically luminous as other wns , but have significantly lower mass - loss rates .",
    "how did these stars evolve ?",
    "we believe the answer to this requires a careful comparison of their physical properties with other wns , and this modeling effort is underway , assisted now by uv data recently obtained with _ hst_. we find that one of the stars discovered in the current paper , lmce069 - 1 , may be the faintest wr star known ( in terms of absolute visual magnitude , which is @xmath67 for this star ) , and it may also be a little more intermediate in type than the others , showing both stronger emission and weaker absorption .",
    "we are often asked if there is anything special about the spatial distributions of these wn3/o3 stars in comparison to  normal \" wrs .",
    "if they were separated , or more isolated , one might use this information to infer that they are formed from different progenitors .",
    "[ fig : lmcwr ] shows rather conclusively that there is not .",
    "we have marked the non - wn3/o3s with green x s , and the wn3/o3s with circles ( red if found last year , and blue if found this year ) .",
    "to us , there appears to be nothing unusual in their locations .    we do wish to call attention to one fact that we did not appreciate until recently .",
    "five of the 12 smc wrs are also faint ( @xmath68 to @xmath69 ) , and also show absorption spectra typical of very early o stars ( see table 1 of massey et al .   2003 ) .",
    "perhaps these are similar to the wn3/o3 stars we have discovered in the lmc .",
    "we are currently investigating this possibility .",
    "although the smc wrs are often considered to be binaries , we ll note that conti et al .",
    "( 1989 ) argued that instead they may simply have weaker stellar winds , allowing the presence of photospheric absorption lines .",
    "this is consistent with the results of our modeling for the lmc wn3/o3s .",
    "we are now at a point in our survey where we feel we should address our completeness .",
    "as discussed in paper i , surveys such as ours are not simply _ fluxed - limited _ : an of - type star , for instance , will be bright but with a relatively small ( @xmath2210 ) equivalent width of he ii @xmath2 .",
    "thus , although there is plenty of flux in the line , the star is hard to detect either photometrically or by image subtraction because the magnitude difference is small .",
    "it is really the _ contrast _ between the brightness in the on - line exposure ( through either the _ wn _ or _ wc _ filter ) and that in the continuum exposure ( _ ct _ ) that determines the detectability .",
    "the  flux - limit \" argument comes into play in that as we go fainter the photometric errors increase , and thus a given magnitude difference becomes less significance relative to the photometric error .",
    "note that difference in magnitude between the on - line and off - line filter ( @xmath70 m ) is mainly just another way of characterizing the equivalent width .    given that we really did not know how deep we needed to go before we discovered the wn3/o3s , it is a legitimate question of _ are we going deep enough _ ? we can answer this by examining the magnitude difference _",
    "@xmath71 _ against the continuum magnitude _",
    "ct _ in fig .",
    "[ fig : complete ] .",
    "since our survey detected most of the known wrs in our fields ( see paper i ) we have constructed this diagram for all of the wrs we found as part of our program ( both previously known and newly discovered ) .",
    "we have also constructed the 3@xmath64 and 5@xmath64 error limits in our photometry ( _ wn - ct _ or _ wc - ct _ , whichever was stronger ) .",
    "there are several noteworthy aspects of this figure .",
    "first , we confirm that the of - type stars are amongst the hardest to detect .",
    "we also find that the latest type wns ( wn10 - 11 , previously known as the  slash \" wrs ) are also very difficult to detect , due to their very weak he ii @xmath2 lines .",
    "however , at the same @xmath71 that characterizes the wn3/o3s , our 5@xmath64 detection limit is at least a magnitude fainter than where we are finding these stars .",
    "this strongly suggests that we are not missing a fainter population of wn3/o3s .",
    "we have also used this opportunity to examine our deep wr surveys of m33 ( neugent & massey 2011 ) and m31 ( neugent et al .",
    "our conclusions are that while we detected the vast majority of wrs ( if they are similar to those in the lmc ) , we certainly would have missed the wn3/o3s in these galaxies : the combination of faintness with weak lines would have placed them below our detection limits in those galaxies .",
    "thus , we plan a deeper survey of these galaxies in the near future .    as mentioned in section  [ sec - intro ]",
    ", we expect to finish our survey during the next magellanic cloud season , weather permitting .",
    "when we are done , we will have a thorough census of the wolf - rayet content in these nearby , relatively metal - poor galaxies .",
    "while we expected to emerge with a solid knowledge of the numbers and types of wrs in these galaxies , the real value has been in what we did not expect to find , such as the wn3/o3 and various peculiar emission - line stars described here and in paper i. we look forward to the new discoveries that await us next year",
