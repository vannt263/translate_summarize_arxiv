    "chimera states are highly counter intuitive structures coexisting with coherent ( synchronized ) and incoherent ( desynchronized ) oscillations , originally identified in populations of nonlocally coupled oscillators such as ginzburg - landau systems , rssler oscillators and logistic maps  @xcite and in recent times in identical phase oscillators  @xcite .",
    "they have been further studied extensively in various generalized situations , including time delay .",
    "these include networks occurring in neuroscience  @xcite , josephson junction arrays  @xcite , and electrochemical systems  @xcite .",
    "real world examples include uni - hemispheric sleep in certain animals  @xcite , where the awake side of the brain shows desynchronized electrical activity , while the sleeping side is highly synchronized  @xcite .    in recent times",
    "several theoretical studies  @xcite and experimental investigations  @xcite have established chimera as a robust concept occurring in varied complex networks , including chaotic dynamical systems  @xcite .",
    "for example networks of chaotic dynamical systems with nonlocal coupling exhibit coexisting spatial domains of coherence and incoherence  @xcite , coherent travelling waves  @xcite and spiral wave chimera states  @xcite",
    ". experimentally they have been observed in optical  @xcite and chemical systems  @xcite , a mechanical experiment consisting of two populations of metronomes  @xcite and a modified ikeda time delay circuit system  @xcite .",
    "it has been recently pointed out  @xcite that transition from spatially coherent to incoherent state occurs via chimera state in models of coupled logistic map and rssler systems with nonlocal interaction . a very interesting observation in this connection is the identification of chimera and multichimera states ( two or more incoherent domains ) in fitzhugh - nagumo oscillators , and their characterization by using the value of mean phase velocity ( frequency )  @xcite .",
    "one may note that the notion of phase velocity essentially requires periodic behavior of individual oscillators , while this is difficult to extend to chaotic systems .",
    "under suitable circumstances it has been shown that breathing chimera states can also arise , for example in two populations of phase oscillators  @xcite and networks of lorenz systems as we point out later in this paper where cluster states can also arise .",
    "thus there arises an urgent need to characterize the transition from incoherent to coherent state via chimera ( or breathing chimera ) and multichimera states in terms of definitive quantitative measures .",
    "we successfully address this problem by developing suitable statistical measures using the time series of the networks in terms of measures designated as strength of incoherence(@xmath0 ) and discontinuity measure(@xmath1 ) deducible from a local standard deviation analysis .",
    "a clear quantification of chimera and multichimera states is given in terms of nonzero ( but less than unity ) values of @xmath0 and positive integer values of @xmath1 .",
    "the coherent state is characterized by zero @xmath0 and @xmath1 values , while an incoherent state takes unit @xmath0 value and zero @xmath1 value .",
    "breathing chimera and cluster states can also be characterized appropriately .    in this connection",
    "we also wish to point out that kuramoto and his co - workers  @xcite in their early works have characterized the various spatio - temporal patterns occurring in nonlocally coupled systems as a function of coupling strength by a spatial correlation function for the difference of the field variables .",
    "they have shown that the correlation function exhibits a power law dependence on the distance and a discontinuous peak at the origin when the coupling constant is decreased below some critical value , indicating that the spatial pattern is statistically discontinuous , which was also explained through a stochastic model and more generalized multifractal analysis .",
    "it was also shown that the correlations and fluctuations obey a power law similar to the one in the fully developed navier- stokes turbulence except that the exponent changes continuously with the coupling strength . however , it is not clear from these studies that how quantitative characterization to distinguish different dynamical states such as coherent , chimera , multichimera , including stationary and breathing type , cluster and incoherent states can be identified .",
    "we believe that our present investigations gives suitable clear quantitative measures to distinguish these various states .",
    "our characterization works for systems admitting both phase coherent and non - phase coherent attractors where a principal frequency can not be easily identified .",
    "our findings also show that even without introducing the concepts of phase and frequency one can succeed to distinguish different dynamical states , namely coherent , incoherent , chimera , multichimera and cluster states in coupled dynamical systems .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the quantitative measures , namely the strength of incoherence @xmath2 and discontinuity measure @xmath3 as statistical tools to quantify the different dynamical states . in sections",
    "iii , we present our analysis of various dynamical states , including coherent , chimera , incoherent and cluster states in four different networks of nonlinear dynamical systems , and quantitative characterization of these states and their transitions in terms of the new statistical measures .",
    "the paper concludes with a summary in sec .",
    "iv . in appendix",
    "a we describe the difficulty in characterizing different dynamical states by using the original state variables and the necessity to introduce transformed variables . in appendix b",
    "we indicate the method of identification of cluster states .",
    "in order to develop the quantitative measures , we consider a network of coupled dynamical systems with nonlocal interactions of finite radius represented by @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6^{t } \\in   \\mathbb{r}^{d}$ ] , @xmath7 , @xmath8 : constant , and @xmath9^{t}$ ] .",
    "thus @xmath10 represents the state vector of the @xmath11 oscillator . in ( 1 ) @xmath12 denotes the coupling matrix and @xmath13 specifies the number of neighbors in each direction on a ring so that the coupling radius @xmath14 . in this paper , we consider systems having different kinds of attractors , namely ( i ) non - phase coherent attractors : ( a ) mackey - glass ( delay ) system and ( b ) lorenz ( nondelay ) system , and ( ii ) phase coherent attractors : ( c ) rssler ( chaotic ) system and ( d ) fitzhugh - nagumo ( periodic ) oscillators .    to develop suitable quantitative measures , we note that the original dynamical variables @xmath15 are not the most appropriate ones ( see appendix a ) .",
    "so we introduce a transformation of the state variables @xmath15 to new variables @xmath16 , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "now , the occurrence of different synchronized states in the coupled system ( 1 ) can be better illustrated using the new state variables @xmath16 .",
    "we also note that when the @xmath11 and @xmath20 oscillators are oscillating coherently the value of @xmath21 is minimum ( to be precise @xmath22 as @xmath23 ) .    on the other hand when two neighboring oscillators @xmath24 and @xmath25 are oscillating incoherently , @xmath21 s take values between @xmath26 ( where @xmath27 are upper / lower bounds of the allowed values of @xmath28 s ) .",
    "thus in the case of coherent states all the @xmath21 s take a minimum value for all times , while in the case of an incoherent state @xmath21 s get distributed between @xmath26 .",
    "however , in the chimera state some of the @xmath21 s may take the same value while the others may be distributed over the above range . in order to quantify the synchronized states clearly ,",
    "we introduce the notion of standard deviation for the asymptotic state as @xmath29 ^ 2 } \\hspace{0.1 cm } \\big>_{t},\\ ] ] where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 and @xmath34 denotes average over time .",
    "consequently @xmath35 s take a value zero for coherent states and nonzero values for both incoherent and chimera states .",
    "we also note that one is unable to distinguish between incoherent and chimera states using @xmath35 alone because in both the cases @xmath35 can take similar non - zero values . to overcome this difficulty we divide the oscillators into @xmath36 ( even ) bins of equal length @xmath37 .",
    "consequently , we introduce the local standard deviation @xmath38 which can be defined as @xmath39 ^ 2 } \\hspace{0.1cm}\\big>_{t } , \\hspace{0.1cm}m=1,2, ... m.\\ ] ]    the above quantity @xmath38 is calculated for every successive @xmath40 number of oscillators . using ( 3 )",
    "we can introduce a @xmath0 as + @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the heaviside step function , and @xmath43 is a predefined threshold that is reasonably small . here , we take @xmath43 as a certain percentage value of difference between @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "thus when @xmath38 is less than @xmath43 , the value of @xmath46 , otherwise it is 0. consequently , @xmath0 takes the values @xmath47 or @xmath48 or @xmath49 for incoherent , coherent and chimera /multichimera states , respectively .    to gain a better understanding and to distinguish further between chimera and multichimera states",
    ", we also introduce a @xmath1 , based on the distribution of @xmath50 in ( 4 ) .",
    "it is defined as    @xmath51    in this case @xmath52 takes a value 1 for chimera state , and positive integer value greater than 1 for multichimera states . for breathing and cluster states",
    "see below .",
    "the characterization is summarized in table - i.    table - i    [ cols=\"<,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this section we will apply the above quantitative criteria to characterize the different dynamical states and their transitions in coupled nonlinear dynamical systems with nonlocal interactions .",
    "we consider four specific models in our study as described below .      to demonstrate the above characterization , we first consider the mackey- glass ( mg ) system  @xcite @xmath53}$ ] in ( 1 ) with parameters chosen as @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 ( so that individual nodes oscillate chaotically in the absence of coupling ) . in this case",

    "note that the distribution of @xmath75 fails to distinguish different states ( particularly chimera and multichimera states ) .    in figs .",
