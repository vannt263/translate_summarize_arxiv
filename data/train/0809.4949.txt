    "eddington ( 1917 ) discovered an excitation mechanism of stellar oscillations that is related to the opacity in ionisation regions : the @xmath0-mechanism .",
    "this mechanism can only occur in regions of a star where the opacity varies so as to block the radiative flux during compression phases ( zhevakin 1953 ; cox 1958 ) .",
    "ionisation regions correspond to a strong increase in opacity , leading to the `` opacity bumps '' that are responsible for the local driving of modes .",
    "these ionisation regions have nevertheless to be located in a very precise region of a star , neither too close to the surface nor to deep into the stellar core , in order to balance the damping that occurs in other regions .",
    "it defines the so - called _ transition region _ which is the limit between the quasi - adiabatic interior and the strongly non - adiabatic surface . for classical cepheids that pulsate on the fundamental acoustic mode , this transition region",
    "is located at a temperature @xmath1 k corresponding to the second helium ionisation ( baker & kippenhahn 1965 ) .",
    "however , the bump location is not solely responsible for the acoustic instability .",
    "a careful treatment of the @xmath0-mechanism would involve dynamical couplings with convection , metallicity effects and realistic equations of state and opacity tables ( bono et al .",
    "the purpose of our model is to simplify the hydrodynamic approach while retaining the _ leading order _ phenomenon -the opacity bump location- such that feasible dns of the @xmath0-mechanism can be achieved .",
    "we focus our study on radial modes propagating in cepheids and thus only consider the 1-d case .",
    "our model represents a _",
    "local zoom _ about an ionisation region and is composed by a monatomic and perfect gas ( @xmath2 ) , with both a constant gravity @xmath3 and a constant kinematic viscosity @xmath4 . the ionisation region is represented by a parametric conductivity hollow that mimics a bump in opacity as ( gastine & dintrans 2008a ) :    @xmath5 \\text{~with~ }    { { \\cal a}}=\\dfrac{{k_{\\hbox{\\scriptsize max}}}-{k_{\\hbox{\\scriptsize min}}}}{{k_{\\hbox{\\scriptsize max}}}}\\text{~and~ } t^{\\pm}=t-{t_{\\hbox{\\scriptsize bump}}}\\pm e,\\ ] ]    where @xmath6 is the hollow position in temperature , while @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote its slope , width and relative amplitude , respectively .",

    "we are interested in small perturbations about the hydrostatic and radiative equilibria .",
    "the layer is fully radiative and the radiative flux perturbation reads under the diffusion approximation :    @xmath11    where the `` 0 '' subscripts mean equilibrium quantities and primes denote eulerian ones .",
    "the linearised perturbations obey to the following dimensionless equations :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 denotes the density perturbation , @xmath14 the velocity , @xmath15 the imposed bottom flux .",

    "to confirm the instability strips discovered previously in the linear - stability analysis , we perform direct numerical simulations of the _ nonlinear _ problem .",
    "we start from the favourable initial conditions determined by the previous parametric surveys and advance in time the hydrodynamic equations thanks to the high - order finite - difference pencil code .",
    "to determine which modes are present in the dns in the nonlinear - saturation regime , we first perform a temporal fourier transform of the momentum field @xmath27 and plot the resulting power spectrum in the @xmath28-plane ( fig .  [",

    "acoustic modes are extracted because they emerge as `` shark fin profiles '' about definite eigenfrequencies ( dintrans & brandenburg 2004 ) .",

    "it is based on the projection of the dns fields onto a basis shaped from the regular and adjoint eigenvectors that are solutions to the linear - oscillation equations . by using projections onto these two respective sets of eigenvectors",
    ", the time evolution of each acoustic mode propagating in the dns is obtained .",
    "the kinetic energy content of each mode is also available in this formalism , highlighting the energy transfer between modes . as our problem only consists in an initially static radiative zone , the velocity field that develops is only due to acoustic modes , that is ,    @xmath37    where @xmath38 , is the energy contained in the @xmath39-acoustic mode .    the right panel of fig .",

    "is progressively transferred to upper overtones and the nonlinear saturation is achieved above @xmath42 .",
    "these nonlinear couplings mainly involve the @xmath35 and @xmath36 modes because their energy ratios are dominant ( more than @xmath43 of the total energy ) .",
    "the reason for this favored coupling lies in the period ratio existing between these two modes : the fundamental period is @xmath44 , while the @xmath36 one is @xmath45 such that the corresponding period ratio is close to one half ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "this @xmath36 mode , which represents about @xmath47 of the total kinetic energy , is involved in the nonlinear saturation of the @xmath0-mechanism instability through a 2:1 resonance with the fundamental mode .",
    "such a resonance is usual in celestial mechanics with , e.g. , jupiter s moons io ( @xmath48d ) , europa ( @xmath49d ) and ganymede ( @xmath50d ) and it is well known that it helps to stabilise orbits . in our case , this stabilisation takes the form of a nonlinear saturation : the linear growth of the fundamental mode is balanced by the pumping of energy from the linearly - stable second overtone behaving in that case as an energy sink , leading to the full limit - cycle stability .",
    "direct numerical simulations ( dns ) of the @xmath0-mechanism that excite stellar oscillations are performed .",
    "we first compute the most favourable setups using a linear - stability analysis of radial modes propagating in a 1-d layer of gas . in our model , a configurable hollow in the radiative conductivity profile mimics the opacity bump responsible for the layer destabilisation .",
    "the instability strips found in the linear study are outstandingly confirmed by the dns and we show that the nonlinear saturation that arises involves a 2:1 resonance between the linearly - unstable fundamental mode and the linearly - stable second overtone ."
