    "the data are often merely rationalized in terms of the bare protein diameter within the context of an adhesive sphere model and such an approach seems to have merit @xcite .",
    "this empiricism has prompted us to develop a theory of screened charged protein spheres that have a constant stickiness , where the electrostatic interaction is compensated , in part , by the adhesive forces .",
    "thus , we argue that , effectively , the spheres are asigned a hard diameter identical to the actual diameter provided the remnant adhesive interaction now depends on the electrolyte and protein concentrations in a manner to be determined variationally . first , we analyze the second virial coefficient as such , for this will point toward a way of dealing with the osmotic pressure at nonzero concentrations .",

    "therefore , the most straightforward way to interpret our liquid state theory is to stress that our zero - order theory describes the reference state only up to and including the @xmath239th virial within the percus - yevick approximation .",
    "the analysis of phase transitions must be viewed with caution ( for a comparison of recent simulations  taking the limit of zero polydispersity after the limit of vanishing well depth  with percus - yevick theory , see @xcite ) .",
    "a second problem is here that , at large ionic strengths , a considerable electrostatic repulsion is balanced against a significant attraction ( see fig .",
    "1 ) and it is difficult to see how good such a compensatory scheme should work at high concentrations near dense packing .    in summary , we have presented a fairly good theory of the ionic - strength dependence of the osmotic properties of lysozyme in terms of a sticky interaction which is independent of charge or salt concentration .",
    "this conclusion , by itself , is not new for it has been reached earlier by formulating numerical work incorporating short - range forces and screened electrostatics and comparing it with x - ray scattering @xcite and liquid - liquid phase separation @xcite .",
    "the merit of the current analysis is its transparency because it is analytical and it is based on a nonperturbative variational principle for general short - range potentials so it may be readily generalized .",
    "for the repulsive tail of the two particle interaction , we use the debye - hckel potential , which is the far - field solution of the poisson - boltzmann equation . in our case , the ( dimensionless ) potential at the surface is often merely of order unity , so the debye - hckel potential slightly overestimates the solution to the poisson - boltzmann equation . to remedy this ,",
    "we use a renormalized charge within the debye - hckel potential , chosen in such a way that , at large distances , the debye - hckel potential coincides with the tail of the solution of the poisson - boltzmann equation determined by the real charge @xcite .",
    "this will result in an underestimation of the potential at small separations , but the form of the debye - hckel potential we use here ( eq . ( [ debye ] ) )",
    "is in fact only accurate at large separations and overestimates the interaction at small separations appreciably i.e. when overlap of the two double layers occurs ( by about 20% , see @xcite ) .",
    "the two effects thus partly cancel , although the latter effect is larger than the former .",
