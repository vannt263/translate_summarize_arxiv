    "the determination of chemical abundances in cosmic objects started 150 years ago , when gustav kirchhoff and robert bunsen discovered the laws of spectroscopy and founded the theory of spectrum analysis .",
    "in particular , they discovered that each atom exhibits a specific pattern of spectral lines , and that , therefore , by observing an object s spectrum , one can deduce , among other things , its composition and physical conditions .",
    "kirchhoff applied spectral analysis techniques to study the chemical composition of the sun .",
    "many astronomers and physicists have made subsequent contributions to the theory of spectrum analysis .",
    "however , at the present time , the equations linking the abundance of a chemical element to the measured line fluxes are still not beyond dispute .",
    "accurate oxygen abundances in hii regions can be derived via the classic @xmath6 method , often referred to as the direct method .",
    "first , the electron temperature @xmath7 within the [ oiii ] zone and the electron temperature @xmath8 within the [ oii ] zone are determined .",
    "then the abundance is derived using the equations linking the ionic abundances to the measured line intensities and electron temperature .",
    "the ratio of nebular to auroral oxygen line intensities @xmath9 = [ oiii]@xmath104959+@xmath105007/[oiii]@xmath11 is used for the @xmath12 determination .",
    "the ratio of nebular to auroral oxygen line intensities @xmath13 = [ oii]@xmath103727+@xmath103729/[oii]@xmath107320+@xmath107330 ( or the ratio of nebular to auroral nitrogen line intensities [ nii]@xmath14/[nii]@xmath15 ) is used for the @xmath16 determination .",
    "it is common practice to derive one value of the electron temperature @xmath12 or @xmath16 from the measured indicator @xmath9 or @xmath17 and to use the @xmath16@xmath12 relation for the determination of the other electron temperature .",
    "thus , in many cases , the abundances derived by the direct method are dependent on the adopted @xmath16@xmath12 relation .",
    "those direct abundances are at the base of some recent empirical calibrations @xcite .",
    "so the abundances derived through those empirical calibrations are also dependent on the adopted @xmath16@xmath12 relation .",
    "hii region models are widely used to establish the @xmath16@xmath12 relation .",
    "it is commonly accepted that there is one - to - one correspondence between the @xmath16 and @xmath12 electron temperatures .",
    "several versions of a one - dimensional @xmath16@xmath12 relation have been proposed .",
    "a widely used version is that by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) based on the hii region models of @xcite .",
    "other relations have been proposed by @xcite ( based on hii region model calculations by @xcite ) , and @xcite ( based on hii region model calculations by @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "have found that the relation of @xcite is reasonable for @xmath12 @xmath18 1.0 ( @xmath12 is in units of 10@xmath19k ) , however at lower temperatures , the models are more consistent with an isothermal nebula . we have derived a @xmath16@xmath12 relation based on the idea that the @xmath6 method equation for o@xmath2/h@xmath1 applied to the o@xmath2 zone and that for o@xmath20/h@xmath1 applied to the o@xmath20 zone must result in the same value of the oxygen abundance @xcite .",
    "there have been several attempts to establish the @xmath16@xmath12 relation using direct measurements of both @xmath16 and @xmath12 in hii regions . @xcite",
    "have used the measured @xmath9 and @xmath13 values to derive @xmath5 and @xmath4 , respectively , for a number of hii regions in nearby galaxies . comparing @xmath4 to @xmath5",
    ", they found the surprising result that the two temperatures are uncorrelated for most of the objects in their sample .",
    "they noted that , while the exact cause of the absence of correlation is not known , a possible explanation is the contribution of recombination processes to the population of the level giving rise to the [ oii]@xmath107320+@xmath107330 lines . @xcite found a correlation between the @xmath4 and @xmath5 derived for a sample of low - metallicity sdss hii regions .",
    "their @xmath4@xmath5 relation follows that predicted by photoionization models , but the scatter of the data points is large .",
    "@xcite attributed the large scatter to substantial flux errors of the weak [ oii]@xmath21 emission lines .",
    "another interpretation of the scatter in the @xmath16@xmath12 diagram has been proposed . @xcite and @xcite have suggested that there is not a one - to - one correspondance between @xmath16 and @xmath12 , but that the @xmath16@xmath12 relation is dependent on some parameter such as electron density or excitation parameter . on the other hand , @xcite have found that there is a one - to - one correspondence between @xmath16 and @xmath12 for hii regions in nearby galaxies with weak nebular @xmath22 lines ( log@xmath22 @xmath23 0.5 , see the definition of @xmath22 below ) . however , hii regions with strong nebular @xmath24 lines ( log@xmath22 @xmath0 0.5 ) do not follow this relation . as a result ,",
    "the one - to - one correspondence between @xmath16 and @xmath12 disappears if a sample contains hii regions with both weak and strong @xmath22 lines .",

    "particular attention was paid to the weak [ oiii]@xmath104363 and [ oii]@xmath107320+@xmath107330 auroral lines since the accuracy of the electron temperature determination depends mainly on the measurement uncertainties of those emission lines ; 3 ) the emission lines do not have a broad component , thus excluding all agns .    applying these criteria , we selected around 400 spectra out of the original 1 200 000 in the dr6 .",
    "although we visually inspected all spectra , we do not claim any completeness for our sample .",
    "the line intensities in the selected sdss spectra of the hii regions have been measured in the way described in @xcite . in brief",
    ", it can be illustrated by the following example concerning the h@xmath34 line .",
    "the continuum flux level in the wavelength range from @xmath35 = 6500  to @xmath36 = 6650   is approximated by the linear expression @xmath37 the values of the coefficients in eq.([equation : contin ] ) are derived by an iteration procedure . in the first step , the h@xmath34 line region , from 6540  to 6590  is excluded , and all other data points are used to derive a first set of coefficients , using the least - squares method . then , the point with the largest deviation is rejected , and a new set of coefficients is derived . the iteration procedure is continued until the differences between two successive values of @xmath38(@xmath39 ) and @xmath40(@xmath41 ) are less than 0.01@xmath40(@xmath39 ) and 0.01@xmath40(@xmath41 ) respectively .",
    "the profile of each line is approximated by a gaussian of the form @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the central wavelength , @xmath44 is the width of the line , and @xmath45 is the flux in the emission line . if there is absorption , then this line is fitted by two gaussians simultaneously . in this case , the total flux at a fixed value of @xmath10 is given by the expression @xmath46 the values of @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , are derived by requiring the mean difference @xmath53 between the measured flux @xmath54 and the flux @xmath55 ) given by eq.([equation : ftot ] ) to be minimum in the range @xmath39  @xmath41 .",
    "a similar procedure is adopted in the cases of overlapping lines ( e.g. [ oii]@xmath103727 and [ oii]@xmath103729 ) .    in the majority of cases ,",
    "the profile of each line is well fitted by a gaussian since only spectra with smooth line profiles were selected .",
    "thus , the uncertainties in the continuum level determination seem to make a dominant contribution to the uncertainties in the measurements of the weak auroral lines .",
    "the value of @xmath56 ( eq.([equation : df ] ) ) is the mean uncertainty in the measurements of the flux in a single spectral interval .",
    "if we interpret this value as the uncertainty in the continuum level determination , the formal uncertainty in the measurements of the weak line intensity due to the uncertainty in the continuum level determination can be estimated as @xmath56@xmath57 = @xmath58@xmath56 , where @xmath58 is the number of points within the line profile .",
    "alternatively , the formal uncertainty in the weak line measurements defined in such a way can be interpreted as if the value of the continuum level is derived exactly and each point within the line profile involves an error equal to the mean uncertainty @xmath56 and all the errors have the same sign .",
    "one can expect that the formal uncertainty defined as @xmath56@xmath57 = @xmath58@xmath56 is close to the maximum possible error and that the real uncertainty in the line measurements is appreciably lower than this value .",
    "consequently , the condition @xmath56@xmath57 @xmath59 0.5 , when applied to both auroral lines [ oiii]@xmath104363 and [ oii]@xmath107325 , should select only objects with relatively precise line measurements , even though some objects with good measurements will be lost .",
    "the measured emission fluxes are then corrected for interstellar reddening using the theoretical h@xmath60 to h@xmath61 ratio and the analytical approximation to the whitford interstellar reddening law from @xcite . in several cases ,",
    "the derived value of the extinction c(h@xmath61 ) is negative and is set to zero .",

    "our final list includes only high - metallicity objects , those with 12+log(o / h ) @xmath0 8.2 , which gives a total of 181 hii region spectra .",
    "( the oxygen abundances were estimated using the measured electron temperatures @xmath5 and @xmath4 . )",
    "several hii regions have repeated observations ( 7 objects have 2 spectra , and 5 objects have 3 spectra ) so that the number of hii regions ( 164 ) is less than the number of spectra ( 181 ) .",
    "we have excluded low - metallicity hii regions from the present study for the following reason .",
    "a key part of our analysis rests on the comparison between two @xmath4@xmath5 diagrams , one for sdss hii regions and the other one for hii regions in nearby galaxies . in a previous study @xcite , we have considered the @xmath4@xmath5 diagram for high - metallicity hii ( 12+log(o / h ) @xmath0 8.2 ) regions in nearby galaxies .",
    "we have fitted the @xmath4@xmath5 relation by the expression of the type @xmath62 the @xmath4@xmath5 diagram exhibits some non - linearity .",
    "this non - linearity may be explained in two ways : it is artificial and caused by the linear form adopted for the @xmath63 relations for both [ oiii ] and [ oii ] lines ( recall that the @xmath63 relation , or the flux ",
    "flux relation , links the auroral and nebular oxygen line fluxes in spectra of hii regions ) .",
    "perhaps a more complex expression may give a better fit to the @xmath63 relations .",
    "it may also be that the linear expression adopted for the @xmath4@xmath5 relation is not a good approximation , and that an expression of the type , @xmath64 as suggested by @xcite , is more realistic .",
    "thus , the relations derived by @xcite may be considered as a first - order approximation .",
    "extrapolation of the @xmath4@xmath5 relation established for high - metallicity objects ( 12+log(o / h ) @xmath0 8.2 ) to the low - metallicity range may be unreliable .",
    "therefore , only high - metallicity sdss hii regions are considered here .",

    "the absence of this line prevents the determination of the oxygen abundance and hence the use of sdss spectra of nearby galaxies in our study .",
