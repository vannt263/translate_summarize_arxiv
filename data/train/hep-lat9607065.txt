    "the topological susceptibility is defined in continuum qcd as @xmath1 where @xmath2 @xmath3 is the topological charge density and is proportional to the anomaly of the @xmath4 current @xcite @xmath5 the value of @xmath6 for quenched qcd can be related to the masses of the pseudoscalar mesons , by use of @xmath7 expansion @xcite",
    "@xmath8    @xmath6 has been determined on the lattice @xcite and is consistent with the prediction of eq .",
    "( [ eq : massform ] ) .",
    "this solves the so - called @xmath4 problem @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to determine the behaviour of @xmath6 at @xmath9 , in particular across the deconfining phase transition , which in quenched qcd takes place at @xmath10 mev @xcite .",
    "a general expectation is that the topological susceptibility should drop at @xmath11 @xcite , since debye screening inhibits tunneling between states of different chirality and damps the density of instantons .",
    "previous attempts to study @xmath6 through @xmath11 by the field theoretical method were plagued with large statistical uncertainties above @xmath11 @xcite . also the attempts to use the cooling technique encountered difficulties at finite @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the idea of the cooling method @xcite is to measure the topological charge on configurations cooled by locally minimizing the action . at @xmath13 and below @xmath11",
    "the method works well and instantons show up as plateaux of the topological charge versus cooling .",
    "around @xmath11 instantons become unstable , the plateaux disappear and the method becomes ambiguous @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we drastically reduce the statistical fluctuations of the field theoretical method determination , by using an improved topological charge operator as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we redetermine @xmath6 at @xmath13 and study its behaviour through @xmath11 .",
    "the new determination of @xmath6 at @xmath13 is consistent with previous determinations @xcite . at finite @xmath12",
    "we obtain a good determination of @xmath6 .",
    "our main result is that @xmath6 drops at @xmath11 by more than one order of magnitude .",
    "the field theoretical method is a straightforward application of the basic rules and concepts of quantum field theory .    at first",
    "a lattice discretization @xmath14 of the continuum topological charge density operator @xmath3 is defined .",
    "@xmath14 is not unique : infinitely many operators can be defined on the lattice which have the same continuum limit .    in going to the continuum limit a proper renormalization",
    "must be performed , like in any other regularization scheme . in quenched qcd @xmath15",
    "renormalizes multiplicatively @xcite . in formulae @xmath16 as usual , @xmath17 .",
    "the topological susceptibility can be defined on the lattice as @xmath18 the standard rules of renormalization then give @xmath19 where @xmath20 is an additive renormalization containing mixings of @xmath21 to other operators with the same quantum numbers and lower or equal dimensions @xcite .    @xmath22 and @xmath23",
    "can be computed non - perturbatively on the lattice by the heating method @xcite .",
    "renormalizations are induced by quantum fluctuations at the scale of the uv cutoff ( lattice spacing scale ) , so they can be estimated by measuring topological quantities on an ensemble of configurations where the topological content is known and short - range fluctuations are thermalized . in order to do this one can start with a classical configuration on the lattice and perform few local updating steps on it until the short - range fluctuations are thermalized : by repeating this procedure several times an ensemble of trajectories can be constructed , all starting from the same initial configuration . starting from a large instanton and measuring @xmath15 on the ensemble , a plateau at the value of @xmath24 is reached with respect to the number of heating step performed . similarly starting from the flat configuration and measuring @xmath21 a plateau at the value of @xmath25",
    "is reached . to be sure that the initial topology is not changed by the heating procedure ,",
    "each configuration of the sample is checked during heating by performing a few cooling steps to detect its topological charge on a copy of it . if a change occurred the configuration",
    "is discarded @xcite .",
    "once @xmath23 and @xmath22 are known , @xmath6 can be extracted by a subtraction procedure following eq .",
    "( [ eq : defchilat ] ) . clearly @xmath22 and @xmath23",
    "depend on the operator used for @xmath15 .",
    "a standard definition for @xmath15 is @xcite @xmath26 here @xmath27 is the standard levi - civita tensor for positive directions while for negative ones the relation @xmath28 holds .",
    "@xmath29 is the plaquette in the @xmath30 plane at point @xmath31 . with this definition @xmath32 and",
    "the mixing @xmath23 is most of the measured signal in the scaling region @xcite , so that a large error derives from the subtraction procedure performed to extract @xmath6 .    in order to obtain a more precise determination of @xmath6 ,",
    "a new definition of @xmath15 can be used for which @xmath23 is strongly reduced and @xmath22 is closer to its continuum value @xmath33 .    in this work",
    "we use the sequence of improved operators @xmath34 defined in ref .",
    "@xcite : the starting operator of the sequence is the standard definition of eq .",
    "( [ def : qstand ] ) and a smearing procedure is performed at each step of the sequence .",
    "we stop at the second smearing , where a considerable improvement is already achieved . for a full account of our results",
    "we measured the topological susceptibility at zero temperature on a symmetric lattice @xmath35 and at finite temperature on a lattice @xmath36 .",
    "the simulations were performed on a ape quadrics machine .    in figure 1",
    "we plot the value of @xmath37 at zero temperature versus @xmath38 for the three definitions @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) of the lattice topological susceptibility .",
    "there is good scaling : @xmath37 is independent of @xmath38 , as it should .",
    "there is also an excellent agreement between the three determinations . to fix the value of @xmath37 in physical units we use for @xmath41 the two loop formula and for @xmath42 the determination of ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath43 mev .",
    "the horizontal line is the linear fit to the 2-smear data .",
    "it gives @xmath44 mev and is consistent , within errors , with that of ref .",
    "the error includes the uncertainty in @xmath42 .      in figure 2 the topological susceptibility @xmath45 at the transition point",
    "is shown for the 1 and 2-smeared operator .",
    "@xmath6 drops by one order of magnitude from the confined to the deconfined phase .",
    "the results obtained with the two operators are compatible as they should .",
    "the data for the 0-smeared operator have very large error bars and are not shown in the figure .",
    "the data have been plotted versus @xmath46 where @xmath11 is the deconfining temperature coresponding to @xmath47 @xcite . to determine @xmath46 we only need the ratio @xmath48 and for that the two - loop expression is certainly a good approximation within the small interval of @xmath38 used , where @xmath42 can be considered as a constant .",
    "the solid line in figure 5 corresponds to the value of @xmath6 at zero - temperature and is consistent with the data below @xmath11 indicating that @xmath6 is practically @xmath12-independent in the confined phase .",
