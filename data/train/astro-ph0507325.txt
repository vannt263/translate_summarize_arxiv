    "recently a very interesting phenomenon , determined by the uhe proton propagation in imf , has been found @xcite .",
    "it consists in a low energy steepening of the proton spectrum that occurs at energy below @xmath0 ev .",
    "this steepening is caused by an increase of the diffusive propagation time , that rapidly exceeds the age of the universe , and can be explained trough the diffusive propagation of uhecr in imf .",
    "the position of the steepening energy @xmath1 ev , is determined only by the proton energy losses on cmb and coincides with a good accuracy to the position of the 2nd knee observed in the cr spectrum @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will discuss the main features of the diffusive propagation of uhecr in imf , focusing our attention on the steepening energy scale @xmath2 . before entering the details of the diffusive propagation of uhecr protons let us review the main experimental evidences related to imf .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     let us now concentrate on the diffusion coefficient that enters in @xmath3 function , see equation ( [ lambda ] ) .",
    "following @xcite , we assume diffusion in a random magnetic field with a strength @xmath4 on the coherence length @xmath5 . this assumption determines the diffusion coefficient @xmath6 at the highest energies when the larmor radius of protons @xmath7 mpc becomes larger than @xmath5 , namely @xmath8 with @xmath9 . at low energy ( i.e. when @xmath10 )",
    "we have considered three different cases : ( i ) the kolmogorov diffusion @xmath11 ; ( ii ) the bohm diffusion @xmath12 ; ( iii ) an arbitrary case @xmath13 with @xmath14 as the extreme possibility , also in this case @xmath6 is normalized by @xmath15 at @xmath16 , that corresponds to an energy @xmath17 ev .",
    "the diffusion length can be evaluated through the interpolation formula @xmath18 , with : @xmath19 and @xmath20 in the bohm and kolmogorov cases respectively . at distances",
    "@xmath21 the proton propagation becomes rectilinear and the fluxes from individual sources on the lattice are computed in the rectilinear propagation limit . in this limit , taking into account the cosmological evolution of the universe , the diffuse flux in our lattice model will be :    @xmath22    @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the red shift that , according to the standard cosmology , is associated to the source at distance @xmath25 , the two quantities @xmath26 and @xmath27 can be computed according to @xcite .",
    "following @xcite we fix a reasonable strength of the imf : namely @xmath28 ng on the coherence scale @xmath29 mpc .",
    "this choice of @xmath30 is compatible with the limits that follows from the faraday rotation measures and with a rectilinear propagation regime at the highest energies @xmath31 ev . in order to reproduce , in our lattice model , the density of sources as follows from small angle clustering , we have chosen a separation between sources , i.e. a lattice spacing , of @xmath32 mpc that corresponds to a source space density of @xmath33 mpc@xmath34 . in the computation of the fluxes",
    "we have assumed an injection spectrum with a single power law @xmath35 , starting from the minimum energy @xmath36 gev .    as follows from equation ( [ j - diff ] ) the particles that , as a whole , contribute to the diffusive flux are those particles produced inside a sphere of radius @xmath37 , the contribution to the flux is exponentially suppressed for particles produced at higher distances . in figure",
    "[ fig1 - 2 ] ( left panel ) we have reported , fixing @xmath29 mpc and @xmath28 ng the behavior of the maximum contributing distance @xmath38 in the three cases kolmogorov , bohm , and @xmath39 .",
    "the dot - dashed line represents the proton attenuation length @xmath40 , that can be interpreted as the maximum contributing distance in the rectilinear propagation regime .",
    "figure [ fig1 - 2 ] ( right panel ) clearly illustrates the steepening of the diffusive spectrum at low energies .",
    "while the energy - attenuation length @xmath41 diminishes with energy and has the gzk steepening at energy @xmath42 ev , the diffusive maximum distance @xmath38 increases with energy and has a sharp jump at energy @xmath43 ev .",
    "the position of this jump is related only to the proton energy losses , it does not depend on the magnetic field configuration ( i.e. on the diffusion parameters ) .",
    "the energy @xmath44 corresponds to the proton energy at which pair - production energy losses become equal to adiabatic energy losses . at this energy",
    "the upper limit of integration in the syrovatsky solution changes abruptly from @xmath45 to the maximum energy @xmath46 that the source can provide .",
    "let us consider now the uhecr spectra shown in figure [ fig3 - 4 ] ( left panel ) . in this figure",
    "we report the diffusive and universal spectra , the latter corresponds to the rectilinear propagation ( see equation ( [ j - rect ] ) ) in the case of a homogeneous distribution of sources ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "the effect of the low energy steepening is clearly seen in the spectra , with the steepening energy @xmath2 being independent of the diffusive regime chosen . according to the results presented in figure [ fig1 - 2 ] ( right panel )",
    "for @xmath38 the flux below the steepening energy @xmath2 is largest for the kolmogorov diffusion and lowest in the case @xmath39 , with the bohm diffusion between them .",
    "the source luminosity @xmath47 needed to provide the observed spectrum is very high , for a distance between sources of @xmath32 mpc the required luminosity is @xmath48 erg / s . to reduce the required emissivity",
    "one can assume that the acceleration mechanism works only starting from a somewhat higher minimum energy @xmath49 ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "it is also worthwhile to stress that the feature of the dip , that signals in the experimental data for a proton dominated spectrum , is not washed out by the imf in the diffusive approximation .",
    "the validity of this approximation is related to the validity of the syrovatsky solution at energies @xmath50 ev .",
    "the diffusive equation , and hence its solution , are valid only in the case in which the energy losses and diffusion coefficient are time independent . at energies lower than @xmath51 ev , this is not the case , because the propagation time of protons approaches the age of the universe and the effect of the cmb temperature variation with time ( red - shift ) becomes important .",
    "however , our computations show a good agreement between the quasi - rectilinear regime of propagation and the exact rectilinear propagation , this agreement shows the approximate validity of the syrovatsky solution at the discussed energies .",
    "following @xcite we shall conclude by discussing shortly the transition from galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays .",
    "the remarkable feature of the diffusive spectra is the low - energy steepening at the fixed energy @xmath52  ev , which provide the transition from extragalactic to galactic cr .",
    "this energy coincides approximately with the position of the 2nd knee @xmath53 and gives a non - trivial explanation of its value as @xmath54 . like in the above - mentioned works we shall assume that at @xmath55  ev the galactic spectrum is dominated by iron nuclei and calculate their flux by subtracting the calculated flux of extragalactic protons from all - particle akeno spectrum . for these calculations we shall fix the spectrum with magnetic configuration (",
    "1  ng , 1  mpc ) , the bohm diffusion and a separation between sources on the lattice @xmath32  mpc the calculated spectrum of galactic iron is shown in figure [ fig3 - 4 ] ( right panel ) by the dashed curve .",
    "this prediction should be taken with caution because obtained with a model - dependent calculations ( assumption of the bohm diffusion ) and uncertainties involved in the syrovatsky solution",
    ". however , it is interesting to note that the iron - nuclei spectrum in figure [ fig3 - 4 ] ( right panel ) is well described by the hall diffusion @xcite in the galactic magnetic field at energies above the knee .",
    "we have analyzed the anti - gzk effect in the diffusive propagation of uhe protons .",
    "this effect consists in a sharp increase of the maximum distance @xmath38 from which uhe protons can arrive ( figure [ fig1 - 2 ] ( left panel ) ) .",
    "the observational consequences of the anti - gzk effect is a low - energy steepening of the diffuse spectrum . while the shape of the steepening depends on the magnetic field configuration , the steepening energy @xmath2 is practically independent of it .",
    "the steepening of the spectrum at @xmath52  ev coincides with the 2nd knee observed in the cr spectra by most of the detectors and provides a natural transition from galactic iron nuclei to extragalactic protons .",
