    "the exploration of bimetallic transition metal ( tm ) clusters is emerging as a promise field of research because of the new opportunities they offer for developing magnetic recording devices and cluster - assembled materials with new functions for medical applications @xcite .",
    "although the electronic and magnetic properties of bare tm clusters have been actively studied for several years , however less attention has been paid to their alloys because they represent both an experimental and theoretical challenge .",
    "thus , for experimentalists is very difficult to control the stoichiometry of the alloy clusters using chemical methods , and for theoreticians , the determination of the ground - state geometries becomes a very difficult task , as commented later in the main text .",
    "the recent observation of the average magnetic moment enhancement in dilute comn alloy clusters @xcite that contradicts the bulk behavior has introduced an entirely unexpected dimension on the subfield of magnetic alloy clusters and it could pave the way for future possible applications like , for example , in biomedicine as magnetic sensors . although the search for the origin of the aforementioned observation has actively stimulated the research on comn alloy clusters @xcite , however the answer still remains elusive .",
    "a possible explanation is based on the assumption that a virtual bound state ( vbs ) is formed below the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) level and near the mn site @xcite .",
    "a vbs can be defined in the potential scattering model as a resonant scattering near impurity atoms in the host which induces a narrow peak in the conduction band density of states ( dos ) .",
    "originally , the vbs model was developed by friedel @xcite to explain many of the physical properties of bulk magnetic alloys containing dilute magnetic species .",
    "it represents an improvement over the rigid - band ( rb ) model which is based on the assumption that the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands are rigid in shape as atomic number of the alloy changes @xcite . in this article ,",
    "our calculations demonstrate that the origin of the anomalous behavior of the slater - pauling ( sp ) curve of comn alloy clusters does not require the formation of a vbs as suggested in ref .  , but is explained directly in terms of the magnetic moment provided by the mn atoms and the `` spin - flipping '' of the electrons belonging to the co - mn bonding .",
    "thus , with the aim of studying the magnetic properties of co - mn alloy clusters and elucidating the anomalous behavior of their sp curve , we have performed spin - unrestricted density functional theory - based ( dft ) calculations as implemented in the demon - ks3p5 program package  @xcite .",
    "the electronic system consisting in @xmath2 nuclei and @xmath3 electrons is assumed to be described by the next hamiltonian , which expressed in second quantization and in the born - oppenheimer nonrelativistic approximation reads as @xmath4 where the kohn - sham orbitals ( @xmath5 ) were expanded into atomic orbitals @xmath6 in the linear combination of gaussian type - orbitals ansatz .",
    "the orbital basis sets of contraction pattern ( 2111/211*/311 + ) and ( 2211/311/411 ) were used in conjunction with the corresponding ( 5,3,3;5,3,3 ) and ( 3,4;3,4 ) auxiliary basis sets for co and mn , respectively  @xcite .",
    "likewise , _",
    "ad hoc _ model core potentials with contraction pattern ( 4:7,4 ) and ( 5:7,4 ) have been used for describing the inner electrons of co and mn atoms , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the kinetic and nuclear attraction energy of the electrons in an environment of @xmath7 nuclear charges are described by the one - electron term .",
    "the @xmath8 symbol represents the @xmath9 operator , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the electron and nuclear position vectors , respectively .",
    "the two - electron operator represents the coulomb repulsion energy of the electrons . in this case",
    ", the symbol @xmath8 represents the @xmath12 operator for the electrons with coordinates @xmath13 and @xmath14 . the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) is the exchange - correlation energy and we have used here the form proposed in ref .   which is a function of the spin - dependent electron density ( @xmath15 ) and its gradient in the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) .",
    "we have adopted the former gga functional in our dft calculations because it was reported in ref .   that it represents a dramatical improvement in the calculated binding energies of co clusters .",
    "the total energy of the system is calculated adding the nuclear repulsion energy ( @xmath16 ) to the electronic contribution .",
    "a wide set of spin multiplicities ranging from 1 up to a maximum of 61 , depending on the selected cluster , was checked to ensure that the lowest - energy electronic and magnetic configuration is reached .",
    "more information about the computational details can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "hereafter , all calculated results refer only to the co - mn alloy 20 atom clusters .",
    "we have also performed electronic structure calculations of some guessed geometries of the co - mn alloy clusters with @xmath17 and 30 in a range of mn concentration less than 0.3 , but the obtained results slightly differ from that of the @xmath18 case , i.e. , we observed that the calculated magnetic moments of clusters with @xmath17 and 30 increase with the impurity concentration as @xmath18 clusters do .",
    "accordingly , the conclusions drawn from the co - mn clusters with @xmath18 can be extended to clusters with greater size .",
    "the search for the global minima of the co - mn alloys 20 atom clusters was planned as a multistage strategy combining an unbiased search method i.e. , a basin - hopping  @xcite algorithm , in conjuction with a molecular mechanics method  @xcite . in the reoptimization procedure of the clusters , we have made use of the polak - ribire algorithm  @xcite without any symmetry constraint and the root - mean - square gradient was set to @xmath19 kcal/(mol  ) . in a first stage of the calculation method ,",
    "the initial guessed structures of the co@xmath20 cluster were taken from three different sources , namely , the structures were provided by the _",
    "code  @xcite which uses the basin - hoping algorithm , the existing databases  @xcite , and proposed by us .",
    "after that , they were reoptimized with the _ hyperchem _ code  @xcite with the intention to obtain the ideal candidate to the lowest - energy structure of the co@xmath20 cluster .",
    "the converged guessed structures are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and the structural and energetic parameters are reported in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "the ground - state structure ( co@xmath21 ) is a capped double icosahedron .",
    "the cohesive energy and the number of nearest - neighbor co - co bonds reveal that the most stable structure is also the most compact one although the average first - neighbor distance is a little bit higher than the rest of structures plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in a second stage ,",
    "the rest of guessed structures of the co@xmath22mn@xmath23 alloy clusters were built from the geometry of the co@xmath20 cluster but this time @xmath24 co atoms swap positions with @xmath25 mn atoms .",
    "the assumption is underpinned by three arguments : firstly , the ionic radii ( r@xmath26 ) of co and mn atoms are pretty close",
    "i. e. , 1.25    and 1.26   , respectively  @xcite .",
    "secondly , we have calculated the size of the thomas - fermi screening  @xcite outside the atomic sphere of the mn atoms ( @xmath27 ) @xmath28 and it is vanishingly small because the dos at the homo level ( @xmath29 ) provided by our dft calculations are large [ see fig .  [ fig2](c ) ] , so that the exponent in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) is @xmath30 , where @xmath31 represents the average over the lowest - energy co - mn alloy series clusters with @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the size effects are negligible and the addition of mn atoms to the cluster should slightly distort their environment .",
    "thirdly , we have performed a geometry optimization of co@xmath32 , co@xmath33mn@xmath34 , co@xmath35 , and co@xmath32mn@xmath34 clusters by means of spin - unrestricted dft calculations  @xcite and the results show that the elongation of the co - mn average bond length with respect to the co - co one is less than 0.15   . in consequence , the substitution of cobalt atoms by mn atoms should slightly distort the geometric structure of the clusters .",

    "the dos of mn atoms shows a higher - lying occupied bonding orbital for spin - up electrons and a lower - lying ( a few ev above homo level ) empty antibonding orbital for spin - down electrons [ see fig .",
    "[ fig2](d ) ] , while for co first neighbor atoms the dos manifests an increase of the spin - up population [ see fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) ] . in consequence , and based on the mulliken population analysis , the electrons involved in the co - mn bonding move from the spin - down channel of mn atoms to the spin - up channel of the co first neighbor atoms .",
    "this mechanism contributes to raise the magnetic moment of both mn and co neighbor atoms [ see inset and text of the caption in fig .",
    "( [ fig5 ] ) ] . however , the process stops at a critical concentration of the mn atoms because the spin - up channel of the available co atoms does not admit more electrons .",
    "in the range with n varying from 9 to 19 , the process reverse and there is a charge transferring from the mn spin - up channel to the co neighbors spin - down one . in this case ,",
    "the mn and also the co neighbor atoms [ see inset in fig .",
    "( [ fig5 ] ) ] decrease their moments .",
    "it is also interesting finally to comment that the non - monotonic decrease of the magnetic moments at the area above 40  % of mn concentration ( see fig .  [ fig5 ] ) is attributed to the discontinuity of g(n ) with the concentration of the mn impurity .",
    "thus , for example , g(n ) is equal to @xmath50 in the range @xmath51 .",
    "the average magnetic moments of the af mn atoms reported in table  [ table4 ] are approximately constant in this range and consequently the total magnetic moment per atom of the clusters with @xmath51 is not reduced .",
    "the behavior changes drastically for n=13 , where g(13)=3 and @xmath52=-2.39 @xmath53 .",
    "the onset of the discontinuity in g(13 ) and the consequently enhancement of @xmath52 causes a reduction of the total magnetic moment of co@xmath54mn@xmath55 cluster .",
    "the same kind of explanation still persists for the rest of clusters with higher mn concentration .",

    "in summary , the magnetic moment enhancement of comn clusters below 40% of mn concentration and its successive fast dropping has been explained using first - principles electronic structure calculations .",
    "the explanation resides mainly on the magnetic role played by the mn atoms and the `` spin - flipping '' of the electrons belonging to the co - mn bonding .",
