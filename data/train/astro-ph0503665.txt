    "recent xmm-_newton _ and _ chandra _ observations of a number of active galactic nuclei have discovered complex spectral features ( broad and/or narrow ) red - ward of the well known fluorescent fe emission line(s ) at @xmath16kev ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these features are probably produced in ( or very close to ) the supposed accretion disk and , as such , their study provides primary information about the dynamics and physical processes which are taking place in the innermost part of the agn ( see @xcite and @xcite for a review ) . among the models invoked to explain these features there are : _",

    "we use xmm-_newton _ data to discuss the observed line properties of axj0447 - 0627 , a broad line agn at @xmath0 , discovered during the optical identification process of the x - ray sources of the _ asca _ ( @xmath17kev ) hard serendipitous survey ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we assume @xmath18  km  s@xmath19  mpc@xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "axj0447 - 0627 was detected with a @xmath22 in the _ asca _ field pointed at ngc  1667 ( _ asca _ sequence  id@xmath23 ) at the nominal _ asca _ position of @xmath24 = 04:47:48.6 , @xmath25 = @xmath2606:27:50.8 ( j2000.0 ) . the net _ asca _ gis2 counts from the source are @xmath27 ( @xmath17kev ) , corresponding to a @xmath28erg  @xmath29  s@xmath19 ( assuming a power - law photon index @xmath30 ) .",
    "the source attracted our attention because of its position in the hardness ratio diagram ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , indicative of a hard , presumably obscured , x - ray source ( @xmath31 ; @xmath32 ) .",
    "we thus observed axj0447 - 0627 with xmm-_newton _ on sept  8 ,  2002 for a total of about @xmath33ks .",
    "the three epic cameras ( mos1 , mos2 and pn ) were operating in full frame mode and with the thin filter applied .",
    "the xmm-_newton _ data have been cleaned and processed using the science analysis software ( sas version  5.4 ) , and analyzed using standard software packages ( ftools version  4.2 , xspec version  11.2 ) .",
    "event files have been thus filtered for high - background time intervals and only events corresponding to patterns @xmath34 ( mos 1&2 ) and @xmath35 ( pn ) have been used ( see @xcite ) ; the net exposure times at the source position after data cleaning are @xmath36ks ( mos1 , mos2 ) and @xmath37ks ( pn ) .",

    "this is the only detected and visible x - ray source in the _ asca _ error circle ; the x - ray position derived using the xmm-_newton _ data is @xmath24 = 04:47:48.62 , @xmath25 = @xmath2606:28:12 ( @xmath42 away from the nominal _ asca _ position ) .",
    "source counts were extracted from a circular region of radius @xmath43 for the mos and @xmath44 for the pn ( this smaller radius for the pn is due to the proximity of a ccds gap ) .",

    "no statistically significant source variability has been detected during the xmm-_newton _ observation . to improve statistics ,",
    "the mos1 and mos2 data have been combined together , and the mos and pn spectra have been fitted simultaneously , keeping the relative normalization free .",
    "source counts were binned so as to have at least @xmath50 counts in each energy bin .",

    "this object was observed spectroscopically at the tng on october 5th ,  2002 . the optical spectrum ( not reported here )",

    "the optical line properties and position allow us to classify axj0447 - 0627 as a classical broad line agn at @xmath60 .",
    "axj0447 - 0627 also belongs to the _ asca _ medium sensitivity survey , so an independent confirmation of the redshift and of the optical spectral classification comes from the work presented in @xcite .",

    "the residuals show the presence of a possible `` line - like '' feature at @xmath68kev ( observer frame ) , and of a complex structure ( several different lines ? ) in the energy range between @xmath69 and @xmath70kev ( observer frame ) . splitting the total observation into two intervals of similar exposure times",
    ", we do not find convincing evidence of temporal variability of such structures .",
    "we have been unable to reproduce the complex lines structure with a pure reflected continuum , either normal ( pexrav model in xspec ; see @xcite ) or relativistic ( refsch model ; see @xcite ; @xcite ) . a pure reflected continuum with associated emission lines from ca , cr , fe and ni",
    "( see e.g. the modeling of the seyfert  2 galaxy ngc  6552 by @xcite ) is also unable to reproduce the observed structure since the relative abundances of the above elements are different from the expected ones .",
    "we also note that a pure reflected continuum , more typical of optical type  2 agns , is at odd with the optical spectral classification of axj0447 - 0627 .",
    "to investigate the presence of line - like features and to locate their energy centroid we slid a narrow ( @xmath71kev ) gaussian template across the data between @xmath72 and @xmath73kev ( rest frame ) , looking for an improvement to the fit with respect to the simple pl model .",
    "the results are shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : ratiopl ] , where we report the change in fit statistics ( @xmath74 ) as a function of the centroid energy position of the narrow gaussian line .",
    "this analysis points out the presence of a number of possible narrow lines , with rest frame energy centroids at about @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79kev ( in the last case , the line centroid is not well constrained ) .",
    "note that in the resulting fit statistics a @xmath74 greater than @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) represents a feature that is significant at more than 99% ( 90% ) confidence level , so the lines at energies @xmath69 kev and at @xmath82 kev are of lower statistical significance with respect to those at @xmath83kev , @xmath84kev and @xmath85kev .",
    "following these indications , we tried to reproduce the observed spectrum with a power law and five narrow gaussian lines .",
    "the best fit spectral parameters are reported in table  [ tab : gauss ] while the ratio between the data and this possible best fit model is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratiocfr ] ( panel  a ) .",
    "the line at @xmath86kev ( ew@xmath87ev ) is positionally consistent with the emission line , while the line at @xmath88kev ( ew@xmath89ev ) is positionally consistent both with the emission line ( rest frame energy @xmath90kev ) or with the emission line ( rest frame energy @xmath91kev ) .",
    "however the association with the line is unlikely since the measured flux from this line should be at a fixed ratio ( @xmath92 ) with the emission flux , clearly in disagreement with the measured ews .",
    "the association with seems to be more plausible given that this line could be very prominent ( and sometimes with an ew comparable with the narrow line ) in type 1 agn ( see e.g. the case of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 7314 discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "the line at @xmath93kev is positionally consistent with the , while for the remaining two lines ( @xmath94kev and @xmath95kev ) there are no clear associations with well known and expected elements .",
    "the strongest expected lines in the spallation model are the cr  k@xmath8 at 5.4 kev and the mn  k@xmath8 at 5.9 kev @xcite .",
    "both these lines are ruled out by the mismatch with the measured energy lines centroid .",
    "so , unless an energy shift occurs ( but we do not observe any energy shift for the line ) , the spallation model is an unlikely explanation of the xmm-_newton _ data .",
    "we have also evaluated the upper limits for fe  xxv  ( f ) at @xmath96kev and for fe  xxv  ( r ) at @xmath97kev since the strenght of these lines , when combined with the strenght of other ionized fe lines , can constrain emission models ( cfr . @xcite and reference therein ) .",
    "these two lines are not required by the current data set and the 90% upper limit on their ew is @xmath98ev .",
    "the complex structure detected in the spectrum of axj0447 - 0627 could suggest a profile of a fe line produced by an accretion disk .",
    "we explored this interesting possibility using the diskline model @xcite , which assumes a non - rotating schwarzschild black hole .",
    "the relativistic effects have been introduced also in the description of the reflected continuum , replacing the simple power law model with the xspec model refsch .",
    "we started the analysis using a model composed of the refsch model plus a disk line fixing its energy position to @xmath99kev rest - frame ; since in axj0447 - 0627 the observed lines seems to have a significantly larger ew than usual we have also added the corresponding disk line emission fixing the / ratio to that expected form the theory ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "the best fit spectral parameters are reported in table  [ tab : relat ] while the ratio between the data and the best fit model is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratiocfr ] ( panel  b ) .",
    "although the overall fit is statistically acceptable ( @xmath100 ) , the ratio in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratiocfr ] ( panel  b ) shows a `` line - like '' residual at an observed energy of @xmath101kev ( @xmath102kev rest frame ) that we were unable to reduce .",
    "we tried to consider also disk lines associated to at @xmath103kev or to at @xmath104kev emission , and/or allowed the abundance of , and to be a free parameter of the fit , but we were unable to take into account such `` line - like '' structure .",
    "thus we tried the same model first used by @xcite to describe the spectral properties of mcg-5 - 23 - 16 : a narrow component ( @xmath105 fixed at @xmath106kev ) plus a broad relativistic line component ( diskline model ) along with the underlying continuum ( refsch model ) .",
    "the best fit spectral parameters are reported in table  [ tab : relat ] , the ratio between the data and the best fit model is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : ratiocfr ] ( panel  c ) , while the folded model and the model itself are reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : foldedrel ] .",
    "the observed line position ( @xmath107kev ) of the broad relativistic line is inconsistent with the from neutral material but strongly suggests that it is due to fe k@xmath8 emission from ionized he - like material .",
    "overall this modeling provide a good description of the broad band spectral properties of axj0447 - 0627 .",
    "we have also tried to add a relativistic emission line from to the best fit model reported in table 2 ; such line can be accommodated within the present data set ( with an ew of @xmath108ev ) but it is not statistically required .",
    "the observed flux and the intrinsic luminosity in the @xmath109kev energy range are @xmath110erg  @xmath29  s@xmath19 and @xmath111erg  s@xmath19 , the errors reflecting the uncertainties on the best fit model .",
    "we note that the @xmath67kev flux measured with xmm-_newton _",
    "( @xmath112erg  @xmath29  s@xmath19 ) is in very good agreement with the @xmath67kev flux measured with _",
    "using xmm-_newton _ data we have revealed that the optically type 1 agn axj0447 - 0627 at @xmath0 is characterized by a complex of bright and prominent set of lines in the @xmath113kev energy range ( rest frame ) .",
    "we have shown that these lines can be reasonably well reproduced by a physical model comprising a power law , a reflected relativistic continuum , a narrow line from neutral material and a fe he - like k@xmath8 relativistic line from a ionized accretion disk . although not well constrained , the best fit ionization parameter ( @xmath114 in table  [ tab : relat ] ) is consistent with the fe ionization state , as deduced from the best fit line position ( cf .",
    "a similar modeling of the fe line properties ( a narrow plus a broad relativistic component ) has been found to describe , for example , the spectral properties of the seyfert  1.9 mcg-5 - 23 - 16 @xcite , of the radio - quiet quasar mkn  205 @xcite and of the seyfert  1 ngc  3516 @xcite ; the presence of the fe relativistic line from a high ionized accretion disk has been unambiguously reported in the case of mkn  205 . as already discussed by the above authors ,",
    "the most likely origin of the narrow @xmath99kev component is from neutral matter distant from the black hole , e.g. the putative molecular torus .",
    "the resulting best fit of the relativistic `` double horned '' profile implies an inclination of the accretion disk of @xmath9 , as well as that the observed lines should be produced in a narrow region of the disk from @xmath10@xmath11 to @xmath12@xmath13 . as in the case of e.g. eso  198-g24 @xcite and",
    "nab  0205 + 024 @xcite , a few alternative possibilities can be conjectured to explain why the inner radius is larger than the last stable orbit .",
    "the first possibility is that the disk is highly ionized in the inner part , so most of the fe is completely stripped off and the production of the fe lines is suppressed .",
    "second , the accretion disk in axj0447 - 0627 could be truncated at @xmath115 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "finally the relativistic line can be produced by a localized hot spot on the accretion disk surface ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "all the properties discussed above have been also observed in other agns and seem to be in agreement with the expectation from accretion disk theory",
    ". however there is an observed property that is very unusual in axj0447 - 0627 and makes this object unique : the very large ew observed , which is at least a factor 5 greater than that usually measured in other type 1 agns ( see e.g. @xcite and reference therein ) or expected from an accretion disk around a schwarzschild black hole ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . according to the modelling reported in @xcite and @xcite , a high ew could be explained if the primary x - ray source ( illuminating both the observer and the accretion disk ) is located very close to a central and maximally rotating kerr black hole .",
    "however such a combination should also imply a very high value of the reflection parameter @xmath116 and a reflection dominated source , probably in disagreement with the best fit found here .",
    "a way to solve part of these problems is to assume that the emission features appear much stronger than normal because the continuum is strongly absorbed .",
    "we have tested this possibility by adding a partial covering absorption model in front to the underlying continuum . unless the primary agn emission is heavly absorbed ( @xmath117@xmath29 ) and",
    "therefore with signatures falling outside the xmm-_newton _ bandpass ( but this is clearly at odd with the optical spectral classification of axj0447 - 0627 ) , the best fit absorbing @xmath62 and covering fraction ( @xmath118@xmath29 and @xmath119 , respectively ) imply that absorption effects can not take into account the strong emission features observed .",
    "this said , and with the caveat that the model proposed here could be not fully appropriate ( e.g. we have already pointed out that a phenomenological description of the data can be also obtained by a simple power law model plus 5 narrow gaussian lines at rest frame energies of 4.49@xmath120kev , 5.55@xmath121kev , 6.39@xmath122kev , 7.02@xmath123kev and 7.85@xmath124kev ) , we would like to note that the emission lines in axj0447 - 0627 have a total ew of @xmath125kev .",
    "this is an observational result and , as such , is model independent .",
    "these lines deserve further attention and a deeper investigation since any model proposed to describe the x - ray spectral properties of axj0447 - 0627 should be able to explain their large ew .",
    "finally we would like to note that axj0447 - 0627 was selected as a target for an xmm-_newton _ observation because of its observed _ asca _ hardness ratios , indicative of a hard , presumably obscured , x - ray source ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . the xmm-_newton",
    "_ observations reported here have shown that its hard x - ray colors are due to the strong line complex in the observed @xmath126kev energy range rather than to absorption effects .",
    "there have been many claims in recent years about a substantial fraction ( @xmath127% ) of x - ray absorbed optically classified type  1 agn ( with strong implications for agn unification models and synthesis of the cosmic x - ray background ) based mainly on poor quality x - ray data ( e.g. hardness ratios ; see @xcite ) .",
    "the result presented here indicates that a number of these sources , _ thought _ to be x - ray absorbed type  1 agns on the basis of their hardness ratios , could instead be x - ray un - absorbed agns with substantial and complex x - ray line emission ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "based on observations obtained with xmm-_newton _ ( an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and the usa , nasa ) and with the telescopio nazionale galileo ( operated in the island of la palma by the centro galileo galilei of the inaf in the spanish observatorio del roque de los muchacos of the instituto de astrofisica de canarias ) .",
