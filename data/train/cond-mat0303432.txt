    "multiterminal superconductor - normal metal - superconductor ( sns ) junctions are interesting devices where an interplay between the dissipative normal electron current and non - dissipative josephson current can be studied .",
    "the simplest device of this type consists of two superconducting reservoirs and one normal reservoir connected by a small normally conducting t - shape bridge , see fig .",
    "[ device](a ) .",
    "a mesoscopic size of the bridge is essential to keep the coherence of the current transport over the whole device . during the last decade ,",
    "a large amount of interesting experiments have been done with such kind of devices ( for the review see ref .   and",
    "references therein , further references can be found in ref .  ) .",
    "non - equilibrium state in multiterminal sns junctions exhibits two closely related major phenomena : the interferometer effect , which concerns the dependence of normal conductance of the device on the phase difference between the superconducting reservoirs,@xcite and the josephson transistor effect , which concerns the dependence of the josephson current on the current injected from the normal reservoir.@xcite the interferometer effect gives rise to a number of so called josephson - like effects.@xcite    the interferometer effect has received the most of attentions ; it has been extensively studied experimentally@xcite and theoretically,@xcite and presently this effect is rather well understood .",
    "the proximity of the superconducting reservoirs leads to a modification of the density of states and transport properties of the normal bridge ( proximity effect ) , which therefore become sensitive to the phase difference at the reservoirs , and exhibit oscillating behavior as the function of the phase difference .",
    "= 8.5 cm    the josephson transistor effect has been also observed in experiment.@xcite the non - equilibrium josephson effect has been first predicted@xcite and then theoretically studied in the ballistic junctions.@xcite non - equilibrium population of the andreev states@xcite induced by the current injection leads to a full - scale variation of the josephson current with the applied voltage and to the inversion of the current direction .",
    "similar transistor effect has been also investigated in diffusive junctions.@xcite    the most of experiments with multiterminal junctions have been done using diffusive metallic bridges , whose length was large compared to the superconducting coherence length @xmath4 .",
    "in such long junctions , the proximity effect is suppressed , which results in small amplitude of the conductance oscillation ( typically few percents of the full conductance value ) , and small magnitude of the josephson current . in theoretical analysis of the interferometer effect in diffusive junctions , the presence of the josephson current",
    "is usually ignored .",
    "similarly , the theoretical studies of the nonequilibrium josephson effect@xcite are restricted to the regime of `` weak '' proximity effect,@xcite when the induced gap in the normal bridge is much smaller than those in the superconducting reservoirs .",
    "such a regime is relevant for long diffusive junctions and for junctions with high - resistance ns interfaces .",
    "in addition , the non - equilibrium josephson current was calculated for specific four - terminal circuit geometries where the dissipative normal current and the josephson current were spatially separated .",
    "meanwhile , it is conceptually interesting to investigate the problem of interplay of dissipative and josephson currents flowing in the same diffusive lead under a strong proximity effect . in this paper",
    ", we address this problem by studying the non - equilibrium josephson effect in 3-terminal sns interferometers with short arms , whose lengths are _ smaller _ than the coherence length @xmath4 .",
    "co - existence of dissipative and non - dissipative currents in the same proximity region makes it difficult to identify the josephson current component . in equilibrium , the total current flowing through a proximity lead",
    "is the josephson current , which is entirely determined by the supercurrent spectral density and the population numbers of the relevant states .",
    "the presence of the normal injection current and related gradients of the distribution functions violates the local conservation of the supercurrent component which varies along the lead , and hence its direct connection to the josephson current is lost .",
    "nevertheless , as we will show in the paper , a simple picture of the non - equilibrium josephson effect as the result of non - equilibrium population of the states with the same current spectral density as in equilibrium can be justified for some particular cases ( see also ref .  ) .",
    "however , a general situation seems to be more complex .    in the short - arm sns interferometers ,",
    "the proximity effect is strong when the interfaces are transparent , but it also may be strong when the interfaces are highly resistive .",
    "the measure of the strength of the proximity effect is the magnitude of the induced energy gap , which is comparable with the superconducting energy gap in the reservoirs .",
    "consequently , there are full - scale variations of the josephson current and the normal conductance with the applied voltage and the phase difference .    in short diffusive junctions with transparent interfaces ,",
    "the josephson current is solely carried by the andreev states whose energies are smaller than the superconducting energy gap , which is similar to the short ballistic junctions.@xcite consequently , in these junctions , the josephson current can be suppressed to zero but never be reversed .",
    "the josephson current reversion becomes possible in the junctions with resistive interfaces due to the negative contribution of the states with energies above the bulk energy gap .",
    "moreover , in contrast to weak proximity regime,@xcite the current reversion exhibits a fine structure similar to the one theoretically discussed for ballistic junctions,@xcite and recently demonstrated in the experiment with long diffusive junctions.@xcite    the interplay of the injected and josephson currents in the strong proximity regime is important for the interpretation of experiments with current biased junctions , fig .",
    "[ device](c ) .",
    "the magnitude of the non - equilibrium critical josephson current measured with this setup is different , as we will show , from the one derived from the current - phase relation measured by an rf - squid , fig .",
