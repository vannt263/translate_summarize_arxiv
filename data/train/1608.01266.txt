    "powerful outflows of gas are an ubiquitous feature of star - forming galaxies at both low and high redshift .",
    "early optical emission - lines surveys of nearby starburst galaxies carried out by lehnert & heckman ( 1995 , 1996 ) showed that several of the indicators that disclose the presence of a superwind , like extended line emission , shock - like emission - line ratios and broad emission lines , were positively correlated with infrared activity .",
    "nowadays , the detection of superwinds in nearby galaxies through metal absorption - lines measurements , specially of the na i d doublet ( @xmath1 ) , is an extended practice ( heckman et al .",
    "2000 ; martin 2005 ; rupke & veilleux 2005 ; rupke , veilleux & sanders 2005a ; martin & bouch 2009 ; and references therein ) . current studies of blue - shifted absorption lines have confirmed that many nearby infrared luminous ( @xmath2 ) and ultraluminous ( ulirgs , @xmath3 ) star - forming galaxies produce massive superwinds with velocities of several hundreds of km s@xmath4 .",
    "it has been also validated that the velocity , mass , momentum and energy of these outflows scale with the galaxy sfr , luminosity and mass ( rupke , veilleux & sanders 2005b ) ; fact that seems consistent with the picture of a pressure driven superwind ( chevalier & clegg 1985 , cc85 hereafter ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the bulk properties of the hot x - ray emitting haloes ( @xmath5@xmath6 k ) detected around some galaxies ( dahlen , weaver & heckman 1998 ; heckman et al .",
    "2000 ; strickland & heckman 2009 ) also agree with the predictions of simple superwind models ( see stevens & hartwell 2003 ) .",
    "the spectroscopical evidence of galactic scale outflows at intermediate and high redshifts is also ample .",
    "recent infrared and radio studies point out to luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies at @xmath7 , as the hosts of the most intense star formation in the universe ( prez - gonzlez et al .",
    "2005 ; chapman et al . 2005 ) . at redshifts @xmath83 ,",
    "lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) are probably the most notable representatives of such extreme behaviour ( see heckman 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "the optical and infrared spectra of the lbg population at @xmath9 present metal absorption lines and ly@xmath10 emission lines that are respectively blue - shifted and redshifted by hundreds of km s@xmath4 with respect to the galaxies rest frames ( pettini et al .",
    "the same has been observed in optical spectra of lensed ly@xmath10 emitting galaxies at @xmath11 ( frye , broadhurst & benitez 2002 ) .",
    "the redshifted ly@xmath10 signature has been also detected in lbgs at @xmath12 ( e.g. dawson , spinrad , stern et al .",
    "2002 ; tapken et al .",
    "2007 ) . as it has been pointed out by heckman ( 2001 ) and dawson et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , these observations are also consistent with the picture of an optically thick superwind expanding around the star - forming regions .",
    "there is now a consensus on that galactic outflows could have a profound impact on the chemical evolution of galaxies and the dynamics of the igm .",
    "they are expected to terminate star formation in some galaxies and to deposit heavy elements , heat and locally accelerate the igm ( nath & trentham 1997 ; benson & madau 2003 ) .",
    "furthermore , superwinds seem to be one of the main agents in the establishment of the observed strong correlation between galaxy mass and metallicity . a substantial amount of observational evidence points to a selective loss of metals from the least - massive galaxies and a full retention of the same by the most massive ones ( garnett 2002 , tremonti et al .",
    "2004 , lee et al .",
    "the studies are coincident in reporting a saturation of the o / h abundance ( used as a surrogate for metallicity ) for the most massive galaxies and a power - law - like behaviour for the intermediate - mass and least - massive galaxies .",
    "a popular view is that galactic superwinds are to blame for removing metals from the relative shallower gravitational potential wells of the least - massive galaxies .",
    "the absorption - lines and x - ray studies of superwinds from nearby galaxies carried out by heckman et al .",
    "( 2000 ) clearly support this trend .",
    "however , outliers from this empirical relationship have already been found in the form of low - mass high - metallicity dwarf galaxies ( peeples , pogge & stanek 2008 ) and massive low - metallicity early - type ones ( peeples , pogge & stanek 2009 ) .    from another standpoint , the low metallicity ( @xmath13@xmath14 z@xmath15 ) and high gas content of many dwarf irregular galaxies with historials of ongoing or recently finished starburst activity",
    "indicate that they are late - type objects .",
    "the latter is particularly true for blue compact dwarf galaxies ( bcds ) .",
    "it has been suggested that these young objects might be the predecessors of the predominantly early - type , gas - poor and low - metallicity population of de and dsph dwarf galaxies ( e.g. dellenbusch et al .",
    "the favourite theory to explain the gas depletion that such transition implies is again based on starburst driven superwinds ( larson 1974 , dekel & silk 1986 , finlator & dav 2008 ) .",
    "the problem of how galaxies retain only certain amount of metals according to their masses has been already addressed analytically .",
    "lynden - bell ( 1992 ) proposed a simple heuristic model in which the fraction of the starburst - produced metals that are retained by a galaxy is proportional to the depth of the galaxy potential well for galaxies with escape velocities less than the outflow effective terminal velocity , i.e. @xmath16 , and asymptotes to full retention for the most massive galaxies with large @xmath17 .",
    "this heuristic approach has been successfully applied by heckman et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and heckman ( 2001 ) to explain their observational results . under the assumption of an isothermal gravitational potential",
    ", they proposed a scheme in which an asymptotic full retention of metals is achieved when @xmath18 and partial retention is proportional to @xmath19 .",
    "nevertheless , a self - consistent and simple analytical superwind hydrodynamical model incorporating gravitational effects and from which more general conclusions could be reached is still lacking .",
    "cc85 presented the standard galactic superwind model considering just the adiabatic , pressure driven expansion of the hot plasma resulting from the thermalization of individual stellar winds and supernovae ejecta inside of the starburst volume .",
    "their model applies to fast superwinds for which gravitational effects are weak .",
    "this may be the case for low - mass galaxies ; however , for massive galaxies , the binding gravitational energy can be comparable to the energy budget provided by the thermalization of the gas injected in the central regions ( @xmath20 km s@xmath4 , see wang 1995 ) . furthermore , observational studies indicate that in many cases , galactic starburst episodes are centrally concentrated ( e.g. marlowe et al .",

    "2003 ; dellenbusch et al .",
    "2008 ) ; an effect that has been so far neglected in superwind analytical models .    here",
    ", we present a simple stationary spherically - symmetric hydrodynamical model that incorporates gravitational effects and takes into account a central concentration of the dynamical mass with analogue mass and energy injection rates , with the aim of addressing , within the natural limitations of our approach , the following issues : ( i ) how does the galactic gravitational field affect the superwind hydrodynamical profiles and their related observables ? ( ii ) how does the concentration of the dynamical mass and the mass and energy injection rates affect the superwind behaviour ? ( iii ) what is the actual value of the asymptotic terminal speed that will determine the impact of the superwind on its surroundings when gravitational fields are taken into account ? ( iv ) under what circumstances can the outflow be inhibited ?",
    "( v ) what are the possible enrichment scenarios and when do they occur ? ( vi ) what are the implications for the mass - metallicity relationship ? as in previous approaches , a compromise will be established between the two usual suspects of determining the gas fate , @xmath17 and @xmath21 ( see e.g. sharma and nath 2012 ) ; however , here it will be done on a purely hydrodynamical basis and covering the case of gravitational potentials that can reproduce asymptotically flat rotation curves .",
    "this latter fact has not been taken into account in a previous work by wang ( 1995 ) who presented an analytical superwind model considering power - law and logarithmic gravitational potentials .",
    "as it has been previously cautioned , one must distinguish between outflows localized in extent ( just a few kpc around the star forming region ) from those that may be able to completely escape from the galaxies and have an impact on the igm ( see mac low & ferrera 1999 ) .",
    "here we analyze the former case , since as it has been pointed out by heckman ( 2001 ) , the _ intrinsic _ observable manifestations of galactic superwind are produced by material still relatively deep within the gravitational potential of the galaxy dynamical mass .",
    "an overview of the organisation of the paper is given next .",
    "the superwind model is presented at the beginning of section [ model ] .",
    "it is introduced initially for galaxies with compact haloes which do not exceed the optical radius @xmath0 .",
    "this can approximate the case of the biggest brightest spirals for which dark matter only accounts 15% of the total mass ( persic , salucci & stel , 1996 ) and also scuba sources ( silich et al .",
    "2010 ) . in section [ bcs ]",
    ", the boundary conditions needed for a supersonic outflow are obtained .",
    "we also derive an expression for the asymptotic terminal speed and provide limits for which gravitation can establish different flow regimes .",
    "the associated enrichment scenarios are described qualitatively . in section [ sol ] , we obtain analytical superwind solutions for the case of compact haloes .",
    "in general the dark - matter within @xmath0 can vary from 0% to 30%70% ( persic & salucci , 1997 ) ; so , in section [ ana_ext_halo ] we extend our analytical model to galaxies with extended haloes ( i.e. haloes with an extension much larger than @xmath0 ) .",
    "an analytical profile for the haloes is specified in section [ halo ] .",
    "there , we also give the corresponding limits for the retention and escape of the superwind from its host galaxy . in section [ hydrop ]",
    "we present the resulting hydrodynamical profiles considering superwinds ejected by different kinds of galaxies and compare with a previous numerical work that considers massive galaxies with uniformly distributed dynamical masses and injection rates ( silich et al .",
    "we contrast the predictions of our model with observational data in section [ mz ] .",
    "the conclusions are presented in section [ con ] . in appendixes",
    "[ gravth ] and [ coolth ] , formulae that establish the circumstances under which self - gravitation and radiative cooling can inhibit the superwind solution are given .",
    "let s define first the parameters and variables of the model .",
    "the superwind is powered by a central spheroidal object that represents either a galaxy or a protogalaxy .",
    "each central object is defined by a set of _ three parameters and a normalised density profile _",
    "@xmath22 : a characteristic object radius , . ] @xmath23 ; the effective energy deposition rate , @xmath24 ; the effective mass deposition rate , @xmath25 ; and a normalized spatial distribution , @xmath26 .",
    "the latter is used to trace the densities of the dynamical mass ( both the stellar and dark matter components ) and the mass and energy deposition rates inside the galaxy , i.e. they are assumed to be proportional to @xmath27 . in reality , the deposition rates are proportional to the star formation rate , which in turn is related to the surface density of gas .",
    "so , considering a single @xmath27 is a drawback in our model ; however , this affects only the central region ( @xmath28 ) but gives anyway coherent values of the hydrodynamical variables at @xmath23 .",
    "we have followed strickland & heckman ( 2009 ) in assuming that @xmath24 and @xmath25 are given by    @xmath29    and    @xmath30    where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the energy and mass deposition rates due to stellar winds and sne within the whole central volume , @xmath33 is a participation factor that removes negligible thermalization regions , and @xmath34 is the mean thermalization efficiency .",
    "similarly , @xmath35 is a mass loading factor that accounts for the incorporation of ambient gas within the central volume .",
    "the _ effective _ terminal speed is then given by    @xmath36    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the energy deposition rate in units of @xmath39 erg s@xmath4 and @xmath40 is the mass deposition rate in @xmath41 yr@xmath4 .",

    "both are proportional to @xmath27 .",
    "we also have assumed an ideal polytropic flow with polytropic index @xmath52 .",
    "the case @xmath53 is equivalent to the @xmath54 case and @xmath55 is equivalent to the squared sound speed ( aorve - zeferino , tenorio - tagle & silich 2009 ) .",
    "the gravitational acceleration is @xmath56 , where m(r ) is the cumulative dynamical mass ( see section [ bcs ] ) and @xmath57 the constant of universal gravitation .    as it was mentioned in the introduction we concentrate first on the case of compact haloes .",
    "so , the conservation laws that govern the flow outside of the central volume ( @xmath58 ) are    @xmath59    @xmath60    and    @xmath45 } { { \\rm d}r}= -\\rho u \\nabla \\phi .",

    "we neglect the effect of cooling and self - gravitation .",
    "however , we evaluate their impact in appendixes [ gravth ] and [ coolth ] providing a justification for this assumption . here",
    ", we adopt a symmetry - preserving energy balance approach similar to that present in the cc85 model and in the 3d simulations of recchi , matteucci & dercole ( 2001) that will lead us to relations for comparing the relative strengths of the thermalization and the gravitational potential in a similar manner than in the heuristic proposal of lynden - bell , but with a patent hydrodynamical basis . none the less , in order to compare such strengths , we consider physically motivated mass distributions that can recover flat rotation curves by choosing @xmath27 in a suitable manner .",
    "we incorporate in our model the effect of the gravitational field and obtain an analytical solution for the external zone ( @xmath58 ) . for completeness , we obtain numerically the hydrodynamical profiles corresponding to the inner region ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "nevertheless , we use the analytic integrated forms of equations ( [ cmn ] ) and ( [ cen ] ) to obtain the proper boundary conditions at @xmath23 and unveil some relevant physics , as shown below .",
    "we impose boundary conditions that warrant the continuity of the fluxes across the central object surface .",
    "the boundary condition for the mass flux , @xmath63 , is    @xmath64    although trivial , this relation ensures consistency with the stationary mass flux associated to a localised mass injection .",
    "we will focus on superwinds that expand transonically outside of the central object characteristic radius .",
    "such velocity profiles are only possible if the flow attains a mach number equal to unity at @xmath23 , i.e. if @xmath65 . in order to establish the adequate boundary condition for the energy flux",
    ", we need to define first @xmath66 .",
    "we consider two kinds of normalized spatial distributions : a truncated version of a profile introduced by dehnen ( 1993 ) and a uniform distribution ( the almost always casted out assumption ; see , however , ji , wang & kwan 2006 ) .",
    "their respective expressions are @xmath67    and    @xmath68    a huge advantage of the dehnen - like distribution is that it depends on a steepness parameter ] @xmath69 and a scale parameter @xmath70 .",
    "these parameters determine the internal structure of the central object , a feature often ignored in analytical superwind models , but that is decisive in determining the fate of the injected gas .",
    "for @xmath71 we obtain normalized truncated versions of a plateau - like and the hernquist ( 1990 ) and jaffe ( 1983 ) profiles , respectively . written in terms of the normalized radius @xmath72 and the concentration parameter @xmath73 , the explicit expressions for the cumulative mass corresponding to the dehnen - like profile and the uniform distribution are    @xmath74    @xmath75    respectively .",
    "equivalent expressions could be written for @xmath76 and @xmath77 by replacing @xmath62 by @xmath24 and @xmath25 . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we present the normalized cumulative dynamical mass for the jaffe , hernquist and plateau - like profiles using a small concentration parameter and a large one . for small values of @xmath78 ,",
    "most of the mass is contained in the innermost regions of the central object , although at different degrees .",
    "for very large values of @xmath78 , the cumulative mass varies almost linearly with @xmath79 for the jaffe - like profile ; it varies as @xmath80 for the hernquist - like one and ( almost ) reproduces the behaviour resulting from the uniform distribution for the plateau - like profile , i.e. it varies as @xmath81 . for the latter two cases , most of the mass",
    "is contained in the outer layers of the ( proto- ) galaxy .",
    "is different from that of the original dehnen profiles .",
    "this is due to the truncation , since now and respectively , @xmath82 @xmath83 and @xmath84 in the whole volume as @xmath85 . ]",
    "the profiles scale accordingly for other values of @xmath10 and @xmath78 .",
    "the circular velocity profiles , @xmath86 , corresponding to the distributions showed in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] are displayed normalized to @xmath87 in fig .",
    "the escape velocity is given by @xmath88 .",
    "one can recover asymptotically quasi - flat rotation curves for truncated dehnen profiles with @xmath89 and small values of @xmath78 .",
    "thus , we can study the effect of the distribution of the dynamical mass and the energy and mass deposition rates per unit volume in a more general setting than previous works .    .",
    "the solid , dashed and dotted lines correspond to jaffe ( @xmath90 ) , hernquist ( @xmath91 ) and plateau - like ( @xmath92 ) truncated profiles , respectively .",
    "the concentration parameters are @xmath78=0.34 ( upper lines ) and @xmath78=1000 ( lower lines ) .",
    "the crosses correspond to a uniform mass distribution .",
    ", height=188 ]     for the profiles showed in fig .",
    "again , the upper lines correspond to @xmath93 and the lower lines to @xmath94 . , height=188 ]    with equations ( [ dehnen ] ) and ( [ homog ] ) , one can explicitly define @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 and integrate equations ( [ cmn ] ) and ( [ cen ] ) to obtain a bernoulli - like equation ( see aorve - zeferino et al .",
    "2009 ) . from the integration of ( [ cmn ] ) , equation ( [ fmbc ] ) follows immediately .",
    "the integration of ( [ cen ] ) yields @xmath98 @xmath99    and    @xmath100    for the dehnen and the uniform distribution , respectively .",
    "these equations will determine the qualitative character of the solution .",
    "for instance , note that for the jaffe - like profile ( @xmath90 ) , the sum of the kinetic energy and the enthalpy per unit mass is reduced everywhere within the central volume by the same amount ( i.e. by a constant ) due to the steepness of the associated gravitational potential , whereas for the uniform distribution the reduction is proportional to @xmath101 .    for convenience and future use",
    "we define the dimensionless variable @xmath102 as the squared escape velocity at @xmath23 to the squared effective terminal speed : @xmath103    from the rhss of equations ( [ i1 ] ) and ( [ i2 ] ) one can determine whether the inner stationary solution exists or not .",
    "there is no solution at all when    , as a function of the concentration parameter .",
    "the lines correspond to the same kind of profiles showed in fig .",
    "the dash - dotted line is included as a reference.,height=188 ]    @xmath104    respectively .",
    "the resulting threshold lines for @xmath102 are shown in fig .",
    "they are obtained by taking the equality signs in the equations above ; so , according to the case , no solution exists above the respective line . for the dehnen - like profiles this depends on the numerical values of @xmath10 and @xmath78 .    since @xmath105 , the more massive and more compact the object , the closer it will be to the respective threshold line and the more difficult will be for the injected gas to escape from it , as expected . on the other hand , @xmath106 is directly proportional to @xmath24 and inversely proportional to @xmath25 .",
    "hence , poor energy injection rates ( low @xmath31 ) , inefficient thermalization ( @xmath107 ) , high mass injections ( large @xmath32 ) and mass loading ( @xmath108 ) can contribute too to maintaining the gas bound , as it is also expected",
    ". however , there are two characteristics of the inequalities in ( [ vecb ] ) that are not so obvious . first , for the uniform distribution the gas can escape from the central object even when @xmath109 .",
    "the same occur for models with @xmath110 and intermediate to large values of @xmath78 .",
    "second , and as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the gas can remain bound even when @xmath111 provided that @xmath78 remains sufficiently small . for models with @xmath112 the later can occur for large values of the concentration parameter @xmath78 .",
    "the first effect occurs because , as explained before , for the uniform distribution and the dehnen profiles with @xmath110 and large @xmath78 , most of the mass and energy are injected in the outer regions of the ( proto- ) galaxy , where most of the binding mass ( both stellar and dark matter ) is also located .",
    "a parcel of gas at a position @xmath46 within this external zone is driven out by the high pressure gradient more effectively than it is attracted by the gravitational force exerted by the relatively voider central regions ( where less mass is concentrated ) , and thus , the gas has enough time to cross the object boundary before being pulled back by the gravitational field , although it can be with a rather slow velocity .",
    "the second effect , present for the dehnen - like profiles with relatively small @xmath78 ( this depends on the value of @xmath10 ) , can be explained in analogue terms : in this case , the central gravitational potential is so dominant that even for small @xmath102 , the injected gas adopts a steep density profile , and as a result , the energy per unit mass at @xmath23 in particular the enthalpy is small . in consequence ,",
    "the gas can not escape from the central object .",
    "all this implies that only galaxies with their parameter @xmath102 above the threshold defined by ( [ vecb ] ) would have deep enough potential wells to keep their injected gas at @xmath113 and enrich themselves with their processed metals in a total _ closed - box scenario_.    we will proceed to give in advance two results coming from the analytic solution for the external zone , section [ sol ] , equations ( [ cei ] ) and ( [ ceii ] ) .",
    "the first one is that stationary flows that escape the central region with @xmath102 above certain threshold value will have their stationary solution inhibited in the outer zone , @xmath58 .",
    "if the stationary central wind has enough ram pressure , it will be difficult for the outer non - stationary flow to cross again the central object boundary , and thus , most likely , a complex morphology , filamentary and/or turbulent ( stirred up by galactic rotation ) , will result in the outer zone from the interaction of both flows ( outpouring ) .",
    "this would be the case when @xmath102 is equal or somewhat less than 1 .",
    "however , the flow can also be eventually reinserted into the inner zone ( silich et al .",
    "2010 ) and rain down over the central object ( @xmath114 , inpouring ) .",
    "the threshold lines that separate flows in these outpouring ( outflow ) and inpouring ( inflow / rain back ) regimes from flows in a fully stationary regime are given by    @xmath115    the threshold lines for the cases @xmath71 and the uniform distribution are presented in fig .",
    "they clearly reflect that for a fully stationary outflow @xmath116 , i.e. the parameters of the flow need to be such that their combination falls below the respective threshold line .    .",
    ", height=188 ]    the second result is that not all fully - stationary superwinds behave in the same way .",
    "some will have bounded ( in the mathematical sense ) accelerating solutions and some will have bounded decelerating ones . using equations ( [ cei ] ) and ( [ ceii ] ) , we find that for a fully - stationary flow , gravity fixes the _",
    "asymptotic terminal speed _ to defined by equation ( [ veff ] ) .",
    "hereafter , we will give expressions only associated to the truncated dehnen profiles .",
    "the equivalent ones for the uniform distribution can be obtained from them by taking @xmath92 and @xmath117 . ]",
    "@xmath118    from the relation between the velocity and the sound speed at @xmath23 , @xmath65 , it follows that a fully stationary free superwind can not have an accelerating velocity profile if    @xmath119    in this formula , the equality sign corresponds to an almost constant external velocity profile with @xmath120 .",
    "the corresponding threshold lines are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , where we have assumed that @xmath53 .",
    "this assumption will be used in all successive quantitative calculations .    .",
    "the outflows with decelerating supersonic solutions are compressed between these lines and those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . ,",
    "height=188 ]    when the equality in equation ( [ vecons ] ) is satisfied , there is such a concert between gravity and thermalization that the asymptotic terminal speed depends only on the escape velocity ( or rotation speed ) at @xmath23 :    @xmath121    this is a very interesting result ; specially , for the case of asymptotically flat rotation curves .    for the particular case @xmath117 and @xmath92",
    ", our analysis concurs with and can explain the numerical results obtained by silich et al .",
    "( 2010 ) for the case of uniformly distributed dynamical masses and injection rates .",
    "they associated the pouring regime with an in - falling bound wind , which they estimated to occur roughly when @xmath122 .",
    "such implicit estimation is consistent with our more exact limit for the regime .",
    "additionally , they did nt give any limits for separating bounded accelerating from bounded decelerating fully stationary solutions , although they obtained both types of velocity profiles through their numerical calculations .",
    "here , we have presented explicit upper and lower analytical limits for all possible regimes using more realistic distributions .    although subtle , the difference between the lines showed in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] is extremely important .",
    "galaxies with their parameter @xmath102 close to the lines showed in fig .",
    "@xmath123 will generate ( in principle ) fully stationary superwinds with very low asymptotic terminal speeds .",
    "such a decrease of the velocity can lead to high densities and , in consequence , the flow could become both gravitationally and radiatively unstable and eventually enter into the outpouring or even the inpouring regime . since this time",
    ", the gas could have been polluted by mixing with material external to the generating ( proto- ) galaxy before being reinserted , the inpouring ( inflow ) regime corresponds to an _ open - box _ metal enrichment scenario , or perhaps impoverishment or neither of both ; see the general theorems presented by edmunds ( 1990 ) and the work of dalcanton ( 2007 ) .",
    "additionally , one must consider that these limits are general upper bounds .",
    "as suggested above , effects like radiative cooling and self - gravitation can modify the flow . in appendixes  [ gravth ] and [ coolth ]",
    "we evaluate the effect of self - gravitation and also give an approximate analytical expression for the cooling threshold lines .",

    "this effect can be relevant for massive galaxies , specially given that projection effects will in turn determine the observed value of the x - ray temperature ( aorve - zeferino et al .",
    "however , when pertinent , the consideration of such effects would only displace the x - ray data in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] upwards .",
    "this will reflect the fact that deeper gravitational potentials also impose a more stringent condition over the required value of @xmath21 and will provide additional support for the heckman et al .",
    "( 2000 ) conclusion that superwinds can remove metals more easily from the least - massive galaxies .    on the other hand ,",
    "the na d data is more suitable for representing the asymptotic terminal speed . in fig .",
    "[ fig9]b we also display the expected value of its threshold , @xmath261 , equation ( [ vgcon ] ) .",
    "one must remind that such threshold depends just on @xmath232 .",
    "both the na d and the x - rays data are completely above this limit .",
    "this is exactly what should be expected according to our model and the observed lack of correlation between the velocity dispersion in the absorbing material with the galaxies rotation speed ( heckman et al .",
    "2000 ) : if the effective terminal speed satisfies the requirements imposed by gravity and the concentration of the starburst for an accelerating solution ( @xmath262 ) , the resulting superwind will reach an asymptotic terminal speed @xmath263 and no correlation with the galaxy rotation speed will be observed .",
    "however , one could have expected that departures from spherical symmetry , local effects , the presence of a disc , and all the usual buts would have produced at least some deviations .",
    "it seems withal that the threshold @xmath264 is a reliable lower limit .",
    "then again , the difficulties imposed by highly concentrated starburst for outflows can be an argument for explaining the high metallicity measured by peeples et al .",
    "( 2008 ) for their sample of low - mass outliers of the m - z relationship .",
    "the galaxies in their sample do not occupy unexpected positions in the color - magnitude diagram , have normal sfrs and are not unusually compact .",
    "they point out that the only remarkable morphological characteristic in their sample is the presence of bright and often very blue compact cores in ten of the galaxies .",
    "they also suggest that their sample represents transitional dwarf galaxies at the end of their star formation activity and at the edge of becoming typical isolated de and dsph galaxies . however , their high metallicities do not correspond to the expectations for bcds . since the galaxies they selected are isolated and non - interacting , environmental effects can be discarded ( ellison et al .",
    "2009 ) . in terms of a closed - box enrichment model , peeples et al .",
    "( 2008 ) explain that the only possibility is that these galaxies might have low gas fractions for their masses .",
    "in such a case , only a small pollution would be enough to enrich the gas ( dalcanton 2007 ) . on similar grounds , ellison et al .",
    "( 2008 ) analyzed a large galaxy sample from sdss and determined that at fixed mass , galaxies with smaller half - light radii tend to have higher abundances .",
    "they proposed that superwinds could be responsible of the selective loss of metals .",
    "we also suggest that the above effects are or were produced by superwinds struggling against the sharp central gravitational potential of the concentrated starburst episodes , which might correspond to blue cores .",
    "the model here presented ( see model 1 in section [ hydroe ] ) can provide a basis to qualitatively explain these results , as well as to quantitatively evaluate if the superwind hypothesis can approximate the observed dispersion of the mass - metallicity relationship ( tremonti et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "finally , we remark that our model has the scaling properties reported by rupke et al .",
    "( 2005b ) .",
    "it has inherited the scaling with star formation rate and effective terminal speed of the cc85 model .",
    "on the other hand , its scaling properties with respect to galaxy mass and radius are different because of the incorporation of the gravitational field .",
    "for a fixed sfr , rupke et al .",
    "( 2005b ) reported the enhancement of the superwind properties with increasing galaxy mass as an unexpected result .",
    "we have shown that at fixed sfr and starburst concentration , this can be explained in terms of the larger densities of the outflows associated to the most massive galaxies ; so , the larger the galaxy mass the more intense the observable manifestations of the superwind .",
    "however , this can not continue indefinitely , as equations ( [ vepouring ] ) and ( [ outin ] ) establish limits above which galactic superwinds eventually enter into the inpouring or outpouring regimes . in turn",
    ", this can explain the observed flattening of the observable superwind properties for large galaxy masses and sfrs also reported by rupke et al .",
    "( 2005b ) . as an alternative to explain the flattening , those authors proposed heuristically",
    "the existence of a terminal velocity for ulirgs _ above _ which superwinds can not be accelerated , and/or a reduction in thermalization efficiency at high sfr . according to our model",
    ", we find the opposite : there exist an asymptotic effective terminal velocity _ below _ which no accelerating superwind exists and such velocity depends on the galaxies rotation speed ( or mass and radius ) , concentration of their starburst episode , and the steepness of the distribution of their dynamical mass , see equations ( [ vecons ] ) and ( [ accele ] ) .",
    "in this theoretical work we presented an analytical model that permits to predict the impact of the the gravitational field on the free superwind stationary solution .",
    "our general findings are :    1 .",
    "the existence or inhibition of the stationary superwind solution highly depends on the concentration and steepness of the dynamical mass and mass and energy injection rates .",
    "a superwind can be more easily inhibited when the steepness and concentration are high .",
    "we found that the gravitational field fixes the asymptotic terminal speed that will determine the impact of the superwind in the surroundings , equations ( [ vg ] ) and ( [ vge ] ) .",
    "3 .   the gravitational field can establish different flow regimes and enrichments scenarios that also depend on the steepness and concentration of the galactic parameters : close - box enrichment , equation ( [ vecb ] ) ; either non - stationary outflows ( outpouring ) or open - box enrichment / impoverishment ( inpouring ) , equations ( [ vepouring ] ) and ( [ outin ] ) ; and either accelerating or decelerating stationary outflows , equations ( [ vecons ] ) and ( [ accele ] ) .",
    "we have established the limits above which self - gravitation and radiative cooling can inhibit the stationary solution .",
    "self - gravitation is likely to be unimportant effect in most cases .",
    "cooling on the other hand affects preferentially to the most massive and compact galaxies with highly concentrated masses and injection rates .",
    "we have evaluated the impact of the gravitational field on the hydrodynamical profiles .",
    "we find that the gravitational field can drastically change the expected expansion rate and x - ray emission from the superwind .",
    "we find that the gravitational field of the extended haloes associated to massive galaxies can drastically alter the free superwind velocity profile and enhance its observable properties .",
    "we also find that massive haloes can also contribute to the inhibition of the superwind solution . 7 .",
    "our model can explain both the observed initial enhancement and posterior flattening of the superwind properties with the galaxy parameters .",
    "our model is in agreement with observational data that support the view that metals selectively escape from the least - massive galaxies .",
    "however , we demonstrated that , under certain circumstances , a high concentration ( i.e. a small concentration parameter @xmath78 ) can change this . 9 .   in our model , the galaxy total mass ( bm+dm ) ,",
    "the mass contained within a bulge or galaxy nucleus ( defined by the characteristic radius @xmath23 ) , the mass up to the disc characteristic radius , and the steepness and concentration of the external halo , are all correlated .",
    "since the correlations are nonlinear , deviations from galaxy to galaxy are permitted , see tables [ table1e ] and [ table2e ] .",
    "oppositely , we assumed no correlation between the above parameters and the concentration and steepness of the mass distribution for @xmath113 .",
    "this is consistent with the results of the cosmological simulations carried out by abadi et al .",
    "( 2010 ) navarro et al ( 2010 ) , in the sense that haloes are not strictly universal .",
    "this should be expected , as we based our model in the structural contraction property derived from their simulations .",
    "on the other hand , in their extensive work , salucci et al .",
    "( 2007 ) found that the previous parameters were correlated for spiral galaxies , and proposed universal rotation curves assuming a burkert ( 1995 ) profile for the dm distribution .",
    "our theoretical work diverges from theirs in that we considered additionally the mentioned inner concentration and steepness , which traces starburst episodes .",
    "such a consideration discards the possibility of universal halo profiles and rotation curves , since in general this parameters will differ from galaxy to galaxy ( @xmath113 ) ; however , the discrepancy smooths out at larger radii , and thus one could talk of an asymptotically universal property , in the sense defined by salucci et al .",
