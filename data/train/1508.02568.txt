    "clearly , @xmath165 .",
    "we produce a separating set @xmath166 demonstrating that @xmath2 is not @xmath1-tough ; to find it , we augment @xmath145 as follows .",

    "there are two overspan graphs assigned to every black edge , hence @xmath178 .",

    "let us sketch the main modifications required to show that @xmath2 admits a hamilton path from @xmath35 to @xmath22 :    * in lemma  [ l : ham ] , we additionally assume that the matching chosen from the graphs in @xmath40 is incident with neither @xmath35 nor @xmath22 , * in the proof of lemma  [ l : ham ] , the euler tour is replaced by a trail from a vertex of @xmath99 to a vertex of @xmath23 spanning all the vertices of @xmath28 , * to find a matching as above , it is sufficient to increase the bound on the matching number of the graph @xmath42 in lemma  [ l : match ham ] by two , to @xmath209 .    by inspecting inequality  , one can see that the proof of theorem  [ t : main ] works just the same even with the strengthened assumption in lemma  [ l : match ham ] .",
