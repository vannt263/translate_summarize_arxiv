    "the standard model ( sm ) is in perfect agreement with all confirmed collider data , but requires a missing ingredient .",
    "the sm is not regarded as a full theory , since it can not address some issues i.e. , gauge and fermion mass hierarchy , matter- antimatter asymmetry , number of generations , the nature of the dark matter , the unification of fundamental forces and so on . for these reasons ,",
    "the sm can be considered as an effective theory of some fundamental theory at low energy .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is regarded as the most plausible extension of the sm in order to shed light on some of the issues mentioned above @xcite .",
    "it is an essential ingredient in string theory and the most - favoured candidate for unifying the all known interactions including gravity .",
    "it would help stabilize the hierarchy of mass scales between @xmath6 and the planck mass , by canceling the quadratic divergences in the radiative corrections to the mass - squared of the higgs boson @xcite .",

    "must be increased to produce susy particles at the tev scale , and hence be accessible to the lhc . on the other hand",
    ", we can investigate susy effects , indirectly .",
    "the sparticles can contribute to the quantum loop level .",
    "as a result , flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) transition induced by quantum loop level can be considered as a good tool for studying the possible effects of sparticles ( there are many studies in this regard , for the most recent studies see ref .",
