    "the formic acid dimer forms a cyclic complex with a double hydrogen bond and has been extensively studied as an example of this important non - covalent interaction .",
    "one of the best probes of the intermolecular forces @xcite is through the tunnelling splitting caused by a concerted double proton transfer .",
    "@xcite    a series of experimental studies by havenith and coworkers @xcite report measurements for the tunnelling splitting of various isotopomers of the formic acid dimer .",
    "although the initial assignment for the ground - state tunnelling splitting in  was ambiguous,@xcite it was later assigned as 0.0125@xmath0   by comparison with the 0.016@xmath0  splitting found in , @xcite which is also in agreement with more recent experiments .",
    "@xcite the splittings for  and  have not been observed although an upper limit of 0.002@xmath0  has been reported for the latter .",
    "@xcite    computing the tunnelling splitting of the formic acid dimer is a difficult challenge for theoretical chemistry .",
    "@xcite due to the double proton transfer , the barrier is significantly higher than in other molecular systems such as malonaldehyde with only one hydrogen bond and thus the tunnelling splitting is smaller by a few orders of magnitude . as is often the case in theoretical chemistry , there are two difficulties that must be overcome , which are obtaining an accurate description of the potential - energy surface ( pes ) and an accurate simulation of the quantum dynamics in many degrees of freedom .",
    "the first of these challenges has recently been overcome by qu and bowman , @xcite who developed an pes for the formic acid dimer fitted to thousands of ab initio energies .",
    "although the pes appears to be very accurate , they were nevertheless unable to reproduce the observed splittings using an exact quantum dynamics calculation on a reduced - dimensionality system of up to four modes .",
    "note that , due to the small splitting , the statistical errors of a full - dimensional diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) calculation have rendered this approach unusable .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we employ the ring - polymer instanton approach , which has been used to describe tunnelling in a number of molecular systems .",
    "@xcite it is derived from a well - understood approximation to quantum statistics which is known to be increasingly accurate for high barriers with small splittings .",
    "@xcite it therefore complements the dmc method which is applicable to smaller barriers with large splittings .",
    "the approach is very efficient and scales well with the number of degrees of freedom and can be applied directly to the full pes of qu and bowman @xcite without further approximation .    until now theoretical calculations of the splitting have generally varied by at least a factor of 2 from the observed splittings .",
    "this is due in part to less accurate pess but also to approximations made to the quantum dynamics .",
    "as it has not been possible to perform an exact quantum calculation for the full - dimensional system , some compromise has to be made .",
    "these typically include either reduced - dimensionality approaches @xcite or approximate semiclassical methods .",
    "@xcite although the ring - polymer instanton approach also employs a semiclassical approximation , its application differs from previous semiclassical studies in that the optimal pathway is located on the full pes , whereas in ref .",
    "the pathway is defined as an interpolation between the minimum - energy pathway and the sudden approximation , in ref .",
    "the pes is modelled by a quartic double - well coupled to harmonic modes , and in ref .",
    "the pathway is optimized on a less - accurate dft surface which is only partially corrected for with high - level ccsd(t ) calculations along the path . in order to understand why the previous theoretical approaches have failed to predict the tunnelling splitting quantitatively ,",
    "we make a systematic study of the problem applying the same instanton approach both to full- and reduced - dimensional systems . by comparison with exact quantum results",
    "where possible , this analysis can provide an estimate of the errors made both by a reduced - dimensionality approach or by the instanton approximation itself . in this way",
    ", we show that the full - dimensional instanton method is expected to give more accurate predictions than exact calculations in reduced dimensionality unless almost all of the modes are included .",
    "this is confirmed by comparison of the instanton predictions for the tunnelling splittings with experimental measurements which agree within our error estimation .",
    "the ring - polymer instanton approach @xcite provides a semiclassical approximation to the path - integral description of a tunnelling process . rather than enumerating over all possible paths , as in feynman s exact theory",
    ", @xcite one simply locates the dominant pathway and employs a steepest - descent integration around it .",
    "@xcite for high barriers and small tunnelling splittings , such as are found in this case , the method is expected to give an excellent approximation to the exact quantum mechanical result . @xcite",
    "the dominant pathway is found , as described in ref .  , by optimizing a fictitious linear polymer of beads where each bead is a representation of the system and the beads",
    "are connected by mass - dependent harmonic springs .",
    "fluctuations about the pathway are described within a harmonic approximation by diagonalizing the banded mass - weighted hessian matrix of the polymer .",
    "one thus treats the anharmonicity along the pathway explicitly but neglects anharmonic effects orthogonal to it . that this is a double proton transfer causes no difficulties to the instanton method as it is well known to proceed by a concerted mechanism @xcite and",
    "is therefore treated as for any other double well system .",
    "the reduced - dimensional system is defined as described in refs . and .",
    "this procedure can be summarized as follows : the internal modes are defined by the normal modes at the saddle point and their values are computed along the minimum - energy pathway .",
    "the reduced - dimensional pes can then be defined as a function of a set of specified modes , with the unspecified modes given their value found by interpolating along the minimum - energy pathway with respect to the imaginary mode only .",
    "the symmetry of the problem was rigorously preserved to ensure that the two minima are numerically exactly degenerate .",
    "the minima of the formic acid dimer have @xmath1 point - group symmetry and its symmetry elements will be preserved along the tunnelling pathway . at the mid - point of the pathway , as at the saddle point , extra symmetry elements appear and the point group expands to @xmath2 .",
    "however , we use the irreps of the @xmath1 point group to label the modes at both the minima and saddle point along with an assignment of the major components of the displacement vectors obtained by inspection .",

    "this list has been compiled with the intention that the modes with the most significant contributions to the tunnelling splitting appear towards the top , according to the scheme outlined below .",
    "only the @xmath4 modes are coupled to the proton transfer mode and thus only they will be excited along the instanton pathway .",
    "these first 9 modes are ordered according to the magnitude of their displacement at the minimum - energy configurations .",
    "all other modes remain at 0 along the pathway . however , they may still effect the tunnelling splitting by changing the effective zero - point energy along the path .",
    "we order these modes according to the magnitude of the difference in their vibrational frequencies between the minimum and saddle point , @xmath27 .",
    "the order of the first few modes is the same as was chosen in ref .   which makes comparison of results with this study possible .",
    "note that in table [ tab : modes ] we have ordered the modes according to their properties in the  isotopomer .",
    "after isotopic substitution , the frequencies and displacements at equilibrium change somewhat which means that the modes no longer strictly follow the order specified by the magnitudes of @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "however , this does not make significant changes to the conclusions and we have chosen to keep the order the same for all isotopomers to make comparison and presentation of the results simpler .",
    "we ran two types of instanton calculations , one in cartesian coordinates and the other using the reduced - dimensionality modes .",
    "the only difference in the algorithm is that the 6 frequencies related to translations and rotations of the linear polymer only need to be excluded in the former case . in both cases , a length of @xmath30 with @xmath31 beads was found to give converged results to two significant figures .",
    "because it is known by symmetry prescriptions that modes with irreps other than @xmath4 will not be excited along the pathway , the instanton optimized with nine degrees of freedom can be used for all calculations with @xmath32 . after computing the full hessians along this pathway , careful data analysis made it possible to obtain the @xmath33 splittings without extra computation .        , against the mass - weighted distance , @xmath34 , along the instanton paths computed for with different numbers of modes : @xmath35 ( blue ) , @xmath36 ( green ) , @xmath37 ( red ) and ( black ) . as the higher modes do not affect the instanton pathway",

    "this occurs because the action for the latter case is lower and the ring - polymer instanton method automatically finds the minimum action pathway .",

    "it is seen that the instanton results agree within about 20 percent of the reduced - dimensionality quantum calculations where they are available .",
    "this gives us an estimate of the error caused by the instanton approximation which can be assumed to be approximately the same for larger values of @xmath26 as well . in the case of which",

    "makes an enormous change to the predicted tunnelling splitting .",
    "three modes which have the largest effect are the 10th , 11th and 12th degrees of freedom .",
    "this is because their modes excite motion of the central protons orthogonal to the pathway and will feel different force constants at different points along the instanton .",
    "it so happens that in this example , this effect is mostly compensated for by the remaining modes , but this was not obvious _ a priori _ and may not be the case in other systems .",
    "this means that it will not be possible to choose a small set of modes to define a reduced - dimensionality model which can be used to obtain an accurate result .",
    "it is clear from the magnitude of @xmath29 that including the 10th mode , for instance , will dramatically increase the splitting .",
    "however , @xmath29 is not a completely reliable estimator of the effect of adding extra modes and would incorrectly predict that the 15th mode would decrease the splitting .",
    "this is because the instanton does not actually pass through the saddle point due to corner cutting , and it is thus difficult to quantitatively predict the effect that adding extra degrees of freedom will have on the splitting without performing the instanton calculation .",
    "there is a subtle change in the predicted splitting on going from 24 dimensions to the full 30 because one of the rotational modes has @xmath4 symmetry and couples to the pathway .",
    "however , this effect is relatively minor as the rotational mode affects the central hydrogens much less than the heavier skeletal atoms which remain approximately fixed , and the moment of inertia hardly changes along the pathway.@xcite    the full - dimensional results are in good agreement with measurements , where the experimental splittings are known .",
    "it is not surprising that there is only a small effect on isotopically substituting the outer hydrogens because the motion of this atom is far from the proton transfer and thus uncoupled .",
    "therefore , as expected , the action only increases slightly ( by @xmath40 in both cases ) on deuteration .",
    "this is in agreement with the reassignment of the experimentally determined  splitting @xcite from 0.0029@xmath0  to 0.0125@xmath0  as suggested in ref .  .",
    "however , in contrast to the observations , the calculations predict a near equivalence between the tunnelling splittings in  and  or between  and .",
    "this was unexpected as the instanton approach has previously been found to be particularly good at accurately predicting the effect of isotopic substitution @xcite and any errors in the pes are expected to cancel out in these cases .",
    "the slight error which causes this coincidence must generate from the neglect of anharmonicity orthogonal to the instanton pathway which differs depending on the mass of the external hydrogen . on the other hand , substituting the central hydrogens affects the tunnelling pathway itself , which is treated fully anharmonically , and considerably increases the action ( by @xmath41 in both cases ) .",
    "this effect is well described by the instanton approach as was also seen in previous studies .",
    "@xcite    to remove the approximation of the anharmonicity without resorting to reduced - dimensionality approaches , it would be necessary to perform either a path - integral @xcite or dmc computation .",
    "this would however be a significantly longer computation , especially in the case of dmc , which due to the small tunnelling splitting , would require excellent convergence of the statistics .    for a rough analysis of the errors caused by the pes , we note that the best ab initio barrier height available @xcite is 2903@xmath0   whereas that predicted by the fitted surface is 2848@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite scaling the whole potential - energy surface by a factor of @xmath42 would only change the  instanton action , , from @xmath43 to @xmath44 and hence reduce the tunnelling splitting , which is proportional to @xmath45 , by about 10 percent in this case . to avoid the error of fitting the pes",
    ", one could in principle also perform the ring - polymer instanton calculation with on - the - fly calculation of the electronic structure .",
    "the necessary algorithms are available in molpro @xcite but would require significantly more computational effort than using the fitted pes .",
    "recent improvements in the efficiency @xcite of the ring - polymer instanton method may make this a viable method for future studies on systems without fitted pess .",
    "we are thus able to identify the cause of the discrepancy between the 3 or 4-dimensional quantum calculations of qu and bowman @xcite and the experimental observations .",
    "it is due in the main to the reduced - dimensionality treatment rather than with any errors in the fitted pes . like their calculations",
    ", the instanton approach also predicts a splitting a factor of 2 too large when only 3 or 4 modes are included .",
    "however , by increasing the number of modes to full dimensionality we are able to significantly reduce the error and obtain results much closer to those found in experimental studies .",
    "for the formic acid dimer , the ring - polymer instanton method has been used to predict ground - state tunnelling splittings with less than about 20 percent error when compared to exact approaches on reduced - dimensionality systems .",
    "however , the instanton approach is also able to treat the system in full - dimensionality , optimize the tunnelling pathway without _ a priori _ constraints and has calculated tunnelling splittings close to the experimentally - measured values .",
    "we thus confirm the reassignment of the  splitting to be the larger of the two possible values suggested by ref .  .",
    "as was later pointed out , to a very good approximation , the tunnelling splitting should be independent upon deuteration of the outer h atom , @xcite and this is in agreement with our calculations .",
    "our study concludes that the majority of modes will have a non - negligible effect on the tunnelling splitting which makes it extremely difficult to obtain high - accuracy predictions by increasing the dimensionality towards convergence .",
    "it thus seems that a reduced - dimensionality approach , even one employing an exact quantum dynamics method , will not be able to obtain results more accurately than the instanton unless almost all the degrees of freedom are included .    from an analysis of the errors inherent in the pes ,",
    "we expect it to be the cause of only about 10 percent error , whereas the instanton approximation makes about a 20 percent error as is clearly seen when comparing with the reduced - dimensionality quantum results where available .",
    "we thus conclude that the observed 20 percent difference between the calculated full - dimensional splittings and those measured experimentally is due to a combination of these well - understood errors and that these instanton calculations represent the most accurate theoretical treatment performed on this system to date .",
    "previous theoretical treatments have used less accurate pess and either introduced errors by using reduced - dimensionality approaches or by approximating the tunnelling pathway .    although the  splittings were beyond the experimental resolution of ref .  , they may be observable to future experiments .",
    "we expect our prediction for this isotopomer to be as accurate as for the others and can thus be taken as a target resolution for an experimental setup .",
    "the author would like to thank chen qu and joel bowman for useful discussions ."
