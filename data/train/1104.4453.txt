    "the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite has proven to be a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of strongly coupled field theories .",
    "it is widely recognized that this framework has opened a new window toward understanding real - world physics , such as qcd . moreover , in recent years investigations on applications of ads / cft correspondence to condensed matter physics ( or ads / cmt for short ) have accelerated enormously . for reviews , see  @xcite .    in order to describe condensed matter systems holographically , the minimum set of fields in the dual gravity side",
    "contains the graviton @xmath8 , the @xmath9 gauge field @xmath10 , the fermion @xmath11 and/or the dilaton @xmath12 .",
    "thus according to the ads / cft dictionary , the bulk configuration is dual to a certain system with finite charge density , either at finite temperature or at extremality .",
    "the simplest corresponding black hole solution is the reissner - nordstrm black hole in four - dimensional anti - de sitter spacetime ( rn-@xmath13 ) .",
    "it has been observed that the rn-@xmath14 black hole is a perfect laboratory for investigating this ads / cmt correspondence . in particular , studies on the fermionic correlation functions in this background revealed the existence of fermionic quasi - particles with non - fermi liquid behavior  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it was shown in  @xcite that in the extremal rn-@xmath15 background , the scaling behavior of certain correlation functions was governed by an emergent ir cft , which was associated with the @xmath16 symmetry in the near - horizon geometry .",
    "furthermore , such a system also exhibited superconducting phase transitions upon the introduction of charged scalar hair  @xcite .",
    "one particularly interesting quantity characterizing charge transport properties of a certain condensed matter system is the conductivity .",
    "according to the ads / cft correspondence , it can be evaluated in the dual gravity side by working out the current - current correlation function of the bulk @xmath9 gauge field . in  @xcite",
    "the authors considered charge transport properties of 2 + 1 dimensional cfts at non - zero temperature , where they found that the electromagnetic self - duality of the 3 + 1 dimensional theory implied that the the r - current correlation functions obeyed some constraint similar to that found from particle - vortex duality in 2 + 1 dimensional abelian theories .",
    "one may ask if this self - duality still holds in the presence of higher - order corrections .",
    "this issue was explored recently in  @xcite , where the authors considered a particular form of the higher - order corrections , i.e. the weyl tensor coupled to gauge field strengths .",
    "they calculated corrections to the conductivity and found that although self - duality was lost in higher - derivative theories , a similar relation still held for the transverse and longitudinal components of the charge correlation functions , which reduced to the self - dual version at leading order .",
    "the form of the higher - order corrections is not unique , then one wonders how charge transport properties will be modified if other forms of higher - order corrections are considered . in  @xcite higher - order corrections with @xmath0 terms",
    "were also discussed , whose details will be reviewed in the next section .",
    "it was shown that in neutral black hole background , the two actions were equivalent up to redefinitions of coupling constants , which led to the same charge transport properties .",
    "a natural question concerning the charge transport properties is what will happen at finite charge density .",
    "this is the main focus of this paper , i.e. to discuss holographic properties of charged black holes in the presence of @xmath0 corrections . in section 2",
    "we first give a brief review on  @xcite .",
    "then we obtain the corrected background via perturbative techniques and discuss its thermodynamic properties in section 3 .",
    "the dc conductivity is calculated in section 4 , following the effective action approach presented in  @xcite .",
    "we find that when the charge parameter @xmath17 , the dc conductivity agrees with the one discussed in  @xcite .",
    "next we consider the shear viscosity @xmath1 and thermal conductivity @xmath2 in section 5 and compute two interesting ratios @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we find that both ratios can be modified by higher - order corrections , thus the corresponding bounds discussed in previous literatures may be violated .",
    "finally we will summarize our results and discuss relevant issues in the last section .",
    "it was found in  @xcite that the conductivity in three - dimensional field theory side at zero momentum was a constant with no frequency dependence .",
    "the authors of  @xcite attributed this remarkable result to the electromagnetic self - duality of the four - dimensional bulk einstein - maxwell theory . recently in order to acquire a better understanding of this self - duality , the authors of  @xcite considered a particular form of new higher - derivative corrections which involved couplings between the gauge field to the spacetime curvature .",
    "part of the main results are summarized as follows .",
    "the starting point was the four - dimensional planar schwarzschild-@xmath14 black hole , @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "on the other hand , after integrating by parts and imposing the identities @xmath20}=r_{[abc]d}=0 $ ] , the most general four - derivative action contains the following terms , @xmath21,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 .",
    "if we focus on the conductivity , which means that only the current - current two - point functions are relevant , we can just consider the effects of the @xmath23 and @xmath24 terms .",
    "furthermore , after taking a particular linear combination of these three terms , the effective action for bulk maxwell field turns out to be @xmath25,\\ ] ] where @xmath26 denotes the weyl tensor .",
    "then the dc conductivity in the presence of higher - order corrections is given by @xmath27    one can also consider the following type of higher - order corrections instead @xmath28,\\ ] ] which arises from the kaluza - klein reduction of five - dimensional gauss - bonnet gravity .",
    "it was observed in  @xcite that by combining the einstein equation in the neutral black hole background @xmath29 and the definition of the weyl tensor , the action  ( [ equ4 ] ) becomes @xmath30.\\ ] ] it can be easily seen that the resulting action is equivalent to  ( [ equ2 ] ) with the following identifications @xmath31 therefore the charge transport properties are identical . in particular , the dc conductivity can be re - expressed as @xmath32    moreover , gravity duals at finite charge density are of particular interest especially in the context of ads / cmt",
    ". then it would be desirable to study the effects of such higher - order corrections .",
    "however , due to the presence of the nontrivial @xmath9 background gauge field , ( [ equ2 ] ) and  ( [ equ4 ] ) are no longer equivalent . then to consider higher - order corrections to the conductivity , one has to take the back - reaction of the @xmath9 gauge field into account . in the next section",
    "we will calculate the perturbative solution with @xmath0 corrections and discuss its thermodynamics .",
    "our staring point is the rn-@xmath14 black hole with planar symmetry , whose action is given by @xmath33.\\ ] ] the black hole metric can be expressed as @xmath34+\\frac{l^{2}}{r^{2}}\\frac{dr^{2}}{f_{0}(r)},\\ ] ] where @xmath35 there exists a nontrivial background gauge field @xmath36 note that we put a subscript ` 0 ' to denote the leading order quantities from now on .",
    "the horizon locates at @xmath37 , which satisfies @xmath38 .",
    "then we have @xmath39 .",
    "the thermodynamic quantities , such as the chemical potential @xmath40 , the charge density @xmath41 , the energy density @xmath42 and the entropy density @xmath43 , are given as follows @xmath44 we can also evaluate the temperature @xmath45 when we take the extremal limit we can obtain @xmath46 it can be easily verified that the first law of thermodynamics holds @xmath47    next we consider the effects of the higher - order corrections . as illustrated in the introduction , due to the presence of the background @xmath9 gauge field , one should work out the back - reacted solution at first . however , generically it is always difficult to obtain exact solutions in theories with higher - order corrections",
    ". then we may try to obtain the perturbative solution , following  @xcite .",
    "black holes in five - dimensional gauged supergravity with higher - derivatives were also studied in  @xcite . here",
    "the full action including higher - order corrections is given as follows @xmath48,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have rewritten the form of the correction terms so that @xmath49 is a dimensionless constant .",
    "it would be straightforward to obtain the modified maxwell equation @xmath50=0\\ ] ] as well as the einstein equation @xmath51 where @xmath52      1 .",
    "considering the combination @xmath55 , where @xmath56 denotes the einstein tensor , one finds a first - order linear ode for @xmath57 , which is solvable .",
    "2 .   given @xmath57 ,",
    "the modified maxwell equation is easily solved .",
    "3 .   with the above two perturbations",
    ", @xmath58 can be determined by solving the first - order linear ode coming from the @xmath59 component of the einstein equation .",
    "let us turn to our particular ansatz .",
    "it can be seen that step 1 gives @xmath60 without loss of generality we can set @xmath61 , therefore @xmath62 subsequently we can obtain the perturbation for the gauge field from step 2 @xmath63 finally by combining the above two functions , the perturbation for the metric component is given by @xmath64    to determine the integration constants in the above perturbative solutions , we can impose several constraints following  @xcite :      now we have fixed all the integration constants and have arrived at the complete solution .",
    "one additional point is that , in order for the perturbative solution to be valid , the leading - order correction to @xmath75 , denoted as @xmath76 , must be much smaller than @xmath75 .",
    "as one approaches the horizon @xmath77 , it can be seen that @xmath78 therefore the right hand side of the above expression must be much smaller than 1 , which holds when @xmath79 and @xmath80 . however , in the extremal limit @xmath81 , the denominator vanishes , which means that the perturbation scheme breaks down at @xmath37 .    since we have already known the perturbative solution , it is straightforward to discuss its thermodynamics .",
    "thermodynamics of charged black holes was extensively investigated in e.g.  @xcite .",
    "first the temperature is given by @xmath82.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] next the chemical potential is still determined by the value of the gauge potential at the infinity @xmath83 the other thermodynamic quantities can be evaluated in a standard way . for our particular case ,",
    "the simplest method is the so - called background subtraction method .",
    "that is , we choose some reference background and subtract its contribution from the on - shell euclidean action , so that the resulting euclidean action becomes finite .",
    "we work in the grand canonical ensemble , which means that the chemical potential is fixed . in this case",
    "we can simply choose pure @xmath84 as the reference background .",
    "then the remaining thermodynamic quantities can be easily obtained .",
    "the energy density is @xmath85 the charge density is @xmath86 and the entropy density is given by @xmath87 to describe the stability of the perturbative solution , one can consider the following two quantities .",
    "one is the specific heat @xmath88 , which is defined as @xmath89 if the specific heat is positive , the black hole is locally stable to thermal fluctuations . for our particular case , the specific heat turns out to be @xmath90 the other is the electrical permittivity @xmath91 whose positivity signifies the stability of the system under electrical fluctuations .",
    "here we have @xmath92    let us focus on the leading order results first . according to the third law of thermodynamics",
    ", the temperature of the black hole can not be negative , which leads to @xmath93 .",
    "therefore it can be easily seen that at the leading order , @xmath94 , which means that the black hole is locally stable under both thermal and electrical fluctuations . once higher - order corrections are taken into account ,",
    "it is better to explicitly plot the curves of @xmath88 and @xmath95 .",
    "two specific examples are shown in the following , where we have fixed the ratio @xmath96 to different values since we are working in the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "our figures show that both @xmath88 and @xmath95 are definitely positive , which means that the black hole is still thermodynamically and electrically stable at least in our specific examples .    .",

    "the dc conductivity plays an important role in characterizing charge transport properties of a certain system . in the hydrodynamic limit",
    ", it can be determined in terms of the retarded current - current correlation function @xmath99 where @xmath100\\rangle.\\ ] ] here @xmath101 denotes the cft current dual to the bulk gauge field @xmath102 .",
    "it is simpler to evaluate conductivities in neutral backgrounds , as the fluctuations of the gauge field and the fluctuations of the metric get decoupled .",
    "the conductivity in general neutral backgrounds was investigated in  @xcite , where possible bounds on the conductivity were also proposed . moreover ,",
    "weyl corrections to the conductivity in general dimensions were explored in  @xcite .",
    "however , things become more involved in the presence of a nontrivial @xmath9 background gauge field , as the gauge field perturbation @xmath102 can couple to the metric perturbations @xmath103 . to deal with such a more complicated situation ,",
    "the most convenient way is the effective action approach adopted in  @xcite .",
    "the strategy is to impose gauge invariance , which will result in a relation between the two sets of perturbations .",
    "then we make use of this relation to integrate out the @xmath103 components and obtain an action that involves only the @xmath102 fluctuation .",
    "we consider the leading order solution , i.e. rn-@xmath14 black hole , for illustration .",
    "thus we have @xmath110 furthermore , according to the formula for the dc conductivity  ( [ 4eq1 ] ) , it is sufficient to set @xmath111 in subsequent calculations",

    "next one can easily evaluate the flux factor from the on - shell boundary action  @xcite @xmath124 then according to  ( [ 4eq1 ] ) , the dc conductivity is given by @xmath125_{k=0 } = \\lim_{u,\\omega\\rightarrow0}{\\rm im}\\left[\\frac{j_{k}(u)a_{-k}(u)}{\\omega a_{k}(u)a_{-k}(u)}\\right]_{k=0},\\ ] ]    one crucial point is that the numerator in the previous formula is a conserved quantity , @xmath126={\\rm im}(f_{1}(u)a_{k}(u)a_{-k}(u)+f_{2}(u)j_{k}(u)j_{-k}(u))=0,\\ ] ] as the resulting two terms are real . since it does not evolve along the radial direction , it can be evaluated at any point in the spacetime .",
    "we calculate this quantity at the horizon , where the regularity condition  ( [ mem ] ) should be imposed . finally the dc conductivity can be written as @xmath127 where @xmath128    notice that here @xmath129 is also real and so is independent of @xmath130 up to @xmath131 , which means that up to this order @xmath129 is regular at the horizon . then in order to evaluate @xmath132",
    ", it is sufficient to solve for @xmath117 by setting @xmath133 in the corresponding equation of motion .",
    "the calculations can be considerably simplified and the solution can be easily obtained @xmath134 finally the dc conductivity is given by @xmath135 which agrees with the previous result , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "in this section we discuss two other interesting quantities , the shear viscosity @xmath1 and the thermal conductivity @xmath2 , as well as the relevant ratios , @xmath3 and @xmath4 . at first sight ,",
    "the shear viscosity in three - dimensional field theory spacetime does not seem to be as interesting as the four - dimensional counterpart .",
    "however , it would be worth investigating as this quantity is directly related to the ratio @xmath4 .",
    "the shear viscosity is related to the low frequency and zero momentum limit of the retarded green s function of the stress tensor in the dual cft via kubo s formula @xmath140 here the retarded green s function is defined as @xmath141\\rangle,\\ ] ] by now there have been several methods for evaluating the shear viscosity in the presence of higher - derivative corrections .",
    "an incomplete list of references is shown in  @xcite but here we still adopt the effective action approach in  @xcite .",
    "the ansatz for the metric perturbation is @xmath142 where we have set @xmath111 .",

    "it was found in  @xcite that @xmath163 at the leading order , which was an analogue of the wiedemann - franz law .",
    "such a value can also be modified by higher - order corrections  @xcite . for our case ,",
    "the ratio is given by @xmath164 where the differences in the leading order result are due to different normalizations in the gauge kinetic term .",

    "charge transport properties are of particular interest in condensed matter physics , thus it would be desirable to investigate them in the dual gravity side in the spirit of the ads / cmt correspondence . in  @xcite ,",
    "the authors studied charge transport properties in schwarzschild-@xmath14 background in the presence of a particular form of higher - order corrections  ( [ equ2 ] ) .",

    "however , when the background is at finite charge density , the two above mentioned higher - order corrections are no longer equivalent . then in order to understand the effects of higher - order corrections to charge transport properties at finite density , we have to perform case - by - case analysis .    in this paper",
    "we study several holographic aspects of charged black holes under @xmath0 corrections shown in  ( [ equ4 ] ) , which can be seen as a primary step toward better understanding of charge transport properties at finite density . due to the presence of the background gauge field",

    "it can be seen that the higher - order corrections can affect both @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",

    "it was found in  @xcite that the real part of the conductivity had a universal behavior @xmath168 under various forms of higher - order corrections , including the @xmath0 terms we consider in this paper .",
    "this universality supported the argument that the low - frequency behavior of the retarded green s functions is determined by the ir cft .",
    "transport coefficients in extremal black hole backgrounds were also investigated in  @xcite .    to have a more comprehensive understanding on charge transport properties , it is necessary to work out the full retarded green s functions . however , once again due to the nontrivial background @xmath9 gauge field , it is more difficult to compute the corresponding correlation functions even at the leading order , see e.g.  @xcite",
    ". then one may resort to perturbative methods and numerical techniques to obtain such correlation functions .",
