    "driving a system away from thermal equilibrium requires work . since thermal fluctuations",
    "play a paramount role in small , mesoscopic systems it is only consequent to also define a fluctuating work along single trajectories  @xcite . while the celebrated jarzynksi  @xcite and crooks  @xcite non - equilibrium work relations constrain the possible shapes , the actual distribution of the work is still a non - universal function that depends on both the system dynamics and the driving protocol .",
    "analytical expressions for the work distribution in isothermal processes are rather scarce except when the distribution is exactly a gaussian  @xcite .",
    "in particular , a single brownian particle in a moving harmonic potential has been studied extensively both theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite by trapping a colloidal particle with optical tweezers .",
    "the direct application of the jarzynski relation to numerical or experimental data in order to extract equilibrium free energy differences is marred by the fact that it falls into the class of biased estimators .",
    "rare , untypical trajectories with low work values are exponentially weighted and a large number of observations is required for estimates to converge .",
    "this number typically grows exponentially with the mean dissipated work .",
    "two principal schemes have been discussed to address this problem : ( i ) reduction of the mean dissipation by using optimal protocols  @xcite or escorted simulations  @xcite ; ( ii ) unbiased estimators based on bennett s acceptance ratio method  @xcite or extended bridge sampling  @xcite .    of course , the easiest method to reduce the mean dissipated work might still be to reduce the driving speed and keep the system close to equilibrium . in this case",
    "a gaussian has been predicted  @xcite as the limit distribution for the work .",
    "however , as has been noted many times , a naive application of a truncated gaussian work distribution leads to wrong results for the free energy difference ( see , e.g. , the discussion in ref .",
    "while the central limit theorem predicts that the center of the distribution approaches a gaussian this does not necessarily apply to the extreme tails of the distribution , which are crucial for the correct determination of free energy changes . for practical purposes it is , therefore , important to understand the convergence of the work distribution towards its limiting gaussian distribution",
    "in this paper we study the probably simplest system that leads to a non - gaussian distribution of work : a single brownian particle moving in a one - dimensional , tightening harmonic potential .",
    "in addition to an exponential tail for large work values the probability for negative work values is exactly zero . instead of determining the distribution of work directly",
    "we consider its moment generating function and obtain a closed set of non - linear ordinary differential equations . using this exact result allows us to study the work distribution as we reduce the driving speed .",
    "we consider a particle with position @xmath0 moving in a harmonic potential @xmath1 with time - dependent strength @xmath2 . assuming overdamped dynamics the evolution of the probability distribution @xmath3 is well described by the fokker - planck equation @xmath4.\\ ] ] here and throughout the paper we measure energy in units of @xmath5 with boltzmann s constant @xmath6 , length in units of @xmath7 , and time in units of @xmath8 .",
    "the free diffusion coefficient of the particle is @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the initial non - dimensionless value of the trap strength ( i.e. , from now on @xmath11 ) . given a driving protocol @xmath2 from @xmath12 to @xmath13 the work is defined as the functional @xmath14 = { \\int_{0}^{{t_{\\mathrm{s}}}}{\\mathrm{d}}t\\ ; } { \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}}(x(t),t )     = \\frac{1}{2}{\\int_{0}^{{t_{\\mathrm{s}}}}{\\mathrm{d}}t\\;}\\dot k(t)x^2(t)\\ ] ] with switching time @xmath15 . in particular , for @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) the work is always non - negative ( non - positive ) .",
    "since @xmath0 is the result of a stochastic process the work also will be a random variable with distribution @xmath18 . for any driving protocol @xmath2",
    "the jarzynski relation @xmath19 provides the link between non - equilibrium work and the equilibrium change of free energy @xmath20 , which for the system studied here becomes @xmath21 for the analytical study of work distributions it has turned out to be convenient to consider the joint probability @xmath22 to find the system in state @xmath0 at time @xmath23 and to have spent the accumulated work @xmath24 so far .",
    "its time evolution is governed by @xmath25 in the following we work with the laplace transform @xmath26 for simplicity we focus on @xmath16 . after one integration by parts and using @xmath27 we obtain from ( [ eq : rho : fp ] ) the evolution equation @xmath28 this is a linear reaction - diffusion type equation , called a sink equation , where diffusion is governed by the operator @xmath29 and probability is created or annihilated with a rate proportional to @xmath30 , i.e. , the function @xmath31 is not normalized .",
    "rather , its integral is the moment generating function @xmath32 in particular , the mean and variance are obtained as @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "already in one of the first experiments demonstrating a non - equilibrium work relation  @xcite it has been noted that the distribution @xmath18 for the work is distinctly non - gaussian .",
    "more recent computer simulations have found exponential tails for large @xmath24  @xcite . indeed , considering the extreme case of instantaneously switching from @xmath11 to @xmath35 at some arbitrary time @xmath36",
    "the work spent is @xmath37 .",
    "the work distribution , therefore , becomes @xmath38 where we have averaged over the equilibrium distribution @xmath39 the generating function reads @xmath40 as a signature of the exponential tail @xmath41 diverges for @xmath42 with @xmath43 .",
    "the other limiting case is that of a quasi - static process with @xmath44 and work distribution @xmath45 , implying the generating function @xmath46^{-{\\lambda}/2}.\\ ] ] as a third exact result we note that for @xmath47 @xmath48 solves the sink equation  ( [ eq : sink ] ) .",
    "the generating function @xmath49 obeys the jarzynski relation , cf .",
    "( [ eq : psi ] ) with ( [ eq : jarz ] ) .",
    "this particular solution to the sink equation  ( [ eq : sink ] ) has been discussed first by hummer and szabo  @xcite .",
    "from eqs .  ( [ eq : sink ] ) and  ( [ eq : psi ] ) we obtain the equation of motion @xmath50 after integration over @xmath0 , where @xmath51 is the generalized second moment . multiplying ( [ eq : sink ] ) by @xmath52 and integrating again over @xmath0 results in @xmath53 by following this scheme we obtain a hierarchy of coupled ordinary differential equations .",
    "fortunately , for the harmonic oscillator a closure can be found as follows .",
    "for @xmath47 we observe that the solution  ( [ eq : hs ] ) is a , albeit not normalized , gaussian .",
    "since otherwise @xmath47 is not special we conclude that @xmath31 is a gaussian for all @xmath30 .",
    "then the closure @xmath54 follows from gaussian statistics , expressing the generalized fourth moment in terms of the functions @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",

    "the shaded regions indicate the accessible range bounded by the quasi - static  ( [ eq : psi : qs ] ) and instantaneous  ( [ eq : psi : is ] ) limiting cases ( dashed lines ) .",
    "all lines cross at @xmath62 ( normalization ) and @xmath47 [ jarzynski relation  ( [ eq : jarz ] ) ] .",

    "[ fig : psi ] the generating function @xmath55 for large @xmath30 is shown .",
    "the probability @xmath66 to have spent no work is related to this asymptotic behavior through the initial value theorem , @xmath67 the numerical results suggest that even for large driving speeds @xmath55 decays faster than @xmath68 with @xmath69 and only for instantaneous switching @xmath70 , see equation  ( [ eq : is ] ) . for large @xmath24 an exponential tail is expected  @xcite , which corresponds to a divergence of @xmath55 at @xmath71 . starting from @xmath72",
    "we expect a singularity at time @xmath73 for all @xmath74 , where @xmath75 corresponds to @xmath76 . together with the results eqs .",
    "( [ eq : psi : is ] ) and  ( [ eq : psi : qs ] ) for the two limiting cases this implies a value for @xmath75 that moves from @xmath77 to @xmath78 with decreasing driving speed @xmath61 .",
    "of greater practical importance than quasi - static driving with @xmath79 are processes with slow but finite driving speed @xmath61 . in this case",
    "a gaussian distribution for the work has been predicted  @xcite . of course",
    ", in the present situation the work distribution can never be strictly a gaussian since @xmath80 and because of the existence of an exponential tail for large @xmath24 .",

    "the strategy used in ref .",
    "@xcite to obtain the work distribution for slow driving corresponds to expanding the generalized second moment @xmath89 in powers of @xmath61 . to first order",
    "we obtain from ( [ eq : ode ] ) @xmath90 , which is solved by the quasi - static solution @xmath91 ( [ eq : psi : qs ] ) . for the next order we plug the expansion ( [ eq : phi : ex ] ) into ( [ eq : ode ] ) and retain only terms of order @xmath61 with @xmath92 .",
    "the result is @xmath93 with @xmath94 the generating function now reads @xmath95 the corresponding distribution is of course a gaussian with variance @xmath96 and mean @xmath97 , where @xmath98 in contrast to the truncated gaussian distribution obtained by using the true mean and variance , the distribution following from ( [ eq : psi : slow ] ) _ always _ fulfills the jarzynski relation  ( [ eq : jarz ] ) . in figure",

    "for a driven harmonic oscillator we have derived the equation of motion for the moment generating function of the work distribution . even though the exact distribution is non - gaussian it can be approximated by a gaussian such that the error vanishes with the square of the driving speed @xmath86 .",
    "while such a behavior is expected to hold in general  @xcite it remains to be investigated to which extent the exponent 2 is system dependent .",
    "we have focused on a linear protocol with @xmath16 which corresponds to a stiffening trap .",
    "the case @xmath17 follows in analogy by defining the laplace transform in ( [ eq : lap ] ) with respect to negative work values .",
    "however , it should be kept in mind that _ slow _ driving is defined with respect to the time - scale separation between driving speed and the system s relaxation time @xmath101 , which for a widening trap increases strongly .",
    "the extension to a time - dependent quadratic potential energy with many degrees of freedom is straightforward through using the wick theorem in ( [ eq : closure ] )",
    ". it will be worthwhile to study the method employed in this paper for more complicated potentials @xmath102 . while in the present case the gaussian closure is exact , approximate closures for other potentials might nevertheless lead to accurate results for the work probability and cumulants .",
