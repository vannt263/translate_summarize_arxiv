    "the problem is to plan the search process minimizing the entropy on the value of the starting position considering limits in costs .",
    "the best case is when entropy , or uncertainty in the value of a position becomes 0 with an acceptable cost in search .",

    "@xmath71    subject to a limit in the number of position that can be explored .",
    "the entropy of a position can be approximated by the sum of entropy rates of the pieces minus the entropy reduction due the strategical configurations .",
    "this can be expressed as :    @xmath72    where @xmath73 represents the entropy of a piece and @xmath74 represents the entropy of a structure with possible strategic importance .",
    "this gives also a more general perspective on the meaning of a game piece .",
    "a game piece can be seen as a stochastic function having the state of the board as entrance and generating possible trajectories and the associated probabilities .",
    "these probabilities form a distribution having an uncertainty associated .",
    "the entropy of a positional pattern , strategic or tactic may be considered a form of joint entropy of the set of variables represented by pieces positions and their trajectory .",
    "the pieces forming a strategic or tactic pattern have correlated trajectories which may be considered as forming a plan .",
    "@xmath75    \\label{eq}\\ ] ]    @xmath76    where @xmath77 is a subset of pieces involved in a strategic pattern and the probabilities @xmath78 represent the probability of realization of such strategic or tactical pattern .",
    "the reduction of entropy caused by strategic and tactical patterns such as double attacks , pins , is determined by both the frequency of such structures and by a significant increase in the probability that one of the sides will win after this position is realized .",
    "we may consider the pieces undertaking a common plan as a form of correlated subsystems with mutual information i(piece1,piece2 , ... ) .",
    "it results that undertaking a plan may result in a decrease in entropy and a decrease in the need to calculate each variation .",
    "it is known from practice that planning decreases the need to calculate each variation and this gives an experimental indication for the practical importance of the concept of entropy as it is defined here in the context of chess .",
    "each of the tactical procedures , pinning , forks , double attack , discovered attack and so on , can be understood formally in this way .",
    "a big reduction in the uncertainty in regard to the outcome of the game occurs , as the odds are often that such a structure will result in a decisive gain for a player .",
    "when such a structure appears as a choice it is likely that a rational player will chose it with high probability .",
    "the entropy of these structures may be calculated with a data mining approach to determine how likely they appear in games .",
    "an approximation if we do not consider the strategic structures would be :    @xmath79    [ [ assumption - analysis ] ] assumption analysis : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the entropy of the position is smaller in general than the sum of the entropies of pieces because there are certain positional patterns such as openings , end - games , various pawn configurations in a chess position which result in a smaller number of combinations , results in order and a smaller entropy .",
    "closer to reality would be such a statement :    @xmath80",
    "it is possible to define the information gain during the search process based on the reduction in uncertainty in the following way :    @xmath81    where h represents the uncertainty in the value of the position and @xmath82    @xmath83    represents the variation of uncertainty in the current position after a move is made .",
    "it is the information gained after making a move .    in the case",
    "when @xmath84 we speak of information gain ,    if @xmath85 we understand information lost through approximate evaluation or other operation .",
    "it is possible to describe the information gain of the search process by defining the heuristic efficiency    @xmath86    when @xmath87 @xmath88 1 the information gain results after a move is    @xmath89    this concept may be considered similar to the the concept of information gain for decision trees , the kullback - leibler divergence .",
    "we may see the same principle also here , the higher the difference between entropies , the higher the information gain , which makes very much sense also intuitively and it provides a new theoretical justification for the empirical heuristics of chess and computer chess .",
    "the partial depths method is a generalization of the classic alpha beta in that it offers a greater importance to moves considered significant for the search .",
    "if all moves have the same importance then , the partial depth scheme can be reduced to the ordinary alpha - beta scheme .",
    "it can be described also as an importance sampling search .",
    "the partial depth scheme has been used by various authors .",
    "as hans berliner observed , few has been published about this method  @xcite.the contribution of this article goes in this direction .",
    "it is possible to define a function returning the depth :    @xmath90    this is a generalization of the classic alpha - beta because in classic alpha - beta @xmath91 depth @xmath92 constant ; if the decision to add a certain depth to the path is dependent only on the current move and position , then if @xmath91 path @xmath93 1 the decision depends only on the current position .",
    "the increase in depth is dependent on the path in this method , where the path is composed of moves @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , .... . in the classic alpha - beta",
    "the depth increase is constant regardless of the type of move",
    ".      the principle behind a theory of optimal search should be the allocation of search resources based on the optimality of information gain per cost .",
    "it results that the fraction of a search ply added to the depth of the path with a move should be in inverse proportion to the quality of the move .",
    "the standard approach gives equal importance to all moves , the fraction ply method gives more importance to significant moves .",
    "therefore it must be described a quantitative measure for the quality of a move .",
    "the reduction from the normal depth of 1 ply should be proportional to the quantitative measure of the quality of a move .",
    "the fraction ply fd must decrease with the quality of the move relative to optimal .",
    "the fraction ply added would be equal in this system to the decrease of a full play with the approximate entropy reduction achieved by that move compared to a move having the highest entropy reduction .",
    "for instance for a capture of a rock the entropy reduction is @xmath97    an axiom of efficient search in chess , in computer chess and of efficient search in general should be that the probability of executing a move must be equal to the heuristic efficiency of that move which is equal to the information efficiency of expanding the node resulted after the move .",
    "the same principle can be considered in general for trajectories .    by notation ,",
    "let the heuristic efficiency be he and @xmath98 be the probability of a move in category @xmath99 to be executed .",
    "the heuristic efficiency is a fundamental measure of the ability of a search procedure to gain information from the state space .",
    "the heuristic efficiency depends in this analysis on the categories of moves and trajectories defined .",
    "the examples are for moves with individual tactical values , however the analysis can be extended also to tactical plans generated by pins , forks and other tactical patterns . because such analysis would require some readers to look for the meaning of these structures in chess books and also because space considerations the moves generating such configurations would not be presented as examples .",
    "no additional theoretical difficulties would emerge from the introduction of these move categories . the same applies to strategical elements .",
    "following the principles outlined , a formula for the fraction ply can be derived .",
    "@xmath100    considering that    @xmath101    and    @xmath102    it means    @xmath103    for k = 1 , @xmath104    from this , @xmath105    of course a different value than 1 can be given to the constant k and this will propagate without changing the meaning of the equations . the constant k would increase the flexibility of implementations actually , offering more freedom in this direction .",
    "now consider the same equation for the move category with the best information gain .",
    "it means @xmath106    assuming the moves from the best category , the most informational efficient will always be executed in the search , the following condition must be satisfied :    @xmath107    then @xmath108    so    @xmath109    the cost for execution of any of the two moves is the same . equating this cost",
    ", it results    @xmath110    it means    @xmath111    which is a very intuitive result .    in general , for a @xmath112 , the probability of a trajectory to be explored should be in this system    @xmath113      let @xmath114 be the probability that a move is executed and one more ply is added to the search .",
    "the size of the ply added should be function of this probability .",
    "it is logically to consider the size of the play as a quantity increasing with the probability of the move not being executed .",
    "the probability of the move not being executed is @xmath115 therefore assuming an abstraction , a linear relation of the form : size of ply = k * ( probability of a move not being executed ) then the relation between the size of the ply and the probability of the move to be chosen would be for k = 1    @xmath116    this may be considered even a theorem describing the size of the fraction ply in computer chess and even for other exptime problems under the above assumptions and resulting from the above calculations .    starting from the previous equation , it is possible to use the relative entropies of pieces and positional patterns to implement the previous formula .",
    "consider the check as the move with the ultimate decrease in entropy because its forceful nature and because it has a higher frequency in the vicinity of the objective , the mate than any other move .",
    "then all the other moves may be rated as function of the check move .",
    "let such value be @xmath117 . here",
    "can be used a constant reflecting the above mentioned properties of such move .",
    "it must be noted that not all checks are equally significant .",
    "several categories of checks can be introduced instead of a single check category .",
    "also in the application , not all checks are equally important , check and capture for example gains a better priority but in this example does not have a smaller depth .    as a consequence ,",
    "if the normal increase in search depth is counted as 1 for moves without significance the fractional ply for a check is :    @xmath118    then d = 0 in this system because the best move should be always executed and then the depth added should be 0 .",
    "for a capture of queen the entropy rate of the system decreases with @xmath119 .",
    "then the fractional ply for a queen capture is    @xmath120    after calculations , d = 0.02    for a capture of rock the entropy rate of the system decreases with @xmath97 .",
    "then the fractional ply for a rock capture is    @xmath121    after calculations , d = 1 - 0.776 = 0.223    instead of using the entropy rates for calculating the size of the fractional depth it is possible to use the value of pieces which is strongly correlated for most of the systems with the entropy rate of the pieces.as it can be seen from the calculation above , the higher the differences in entropy between consecutive positions in a variation , the higher the information gain .",
    "this can be understood as a divergence between distributions of consecutive moves .",
    "the more they diverge the higher the information gain after a move .      as a test case",
    "it is used a combination which gives us the possibility to define the quality of the response to a position in a precise way .",
    "the meaning of the columns is the following :",
    "+ column 1:experiment number - represents the number of the search experiment + column 2:nodes searched - represents the number of nodes searched in the experiment + column 3:term dividing the reduction in ply - represents the number dividing the term decreasing the size of the normal ply added to the current depth + column 4 : max depth attained - the maximum depth in standard plies attained , here it is added 1 for each ply + column 5 : max uniform depth - the maximum allowed depth in the partial depth scheme considering a step of 6 decreased with a value depending to the quality of the move + column 6 : solved or not - 1 if the case has been solved with the parameters from the other columns + column 7 : step size - the number added to the partial depth for each new level of search in case of moves without importance + the following is the table with the results of the search experiments :    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]        at first a step representing a fraction of 1 has been used .",
    "however , better results have been obtained by using a step bigger than 1 for not so interesting moves .",
    "the cause is the decrease in the sensitivity of the output and of other search dependent parameters in regard to the variations of other parameters and of the positional configurations .",
    "the detection of the variation leading to the objective early decreases the number of nodes searched very much .",
    "the fact that the mate has been found at 13 plies depth after only 20000 nodes searched shows the line to mate has been one of the first lines tried at each level , even without using knowledge .",

    "even if we keep the maximum depth constant at far greater cost the searches are less likely to find the decisive lines as it can be seen from plots .",
    "as the search has been changed and less importance has been given to interesting moves , the range in the length of the variations became smaller as less energy has been allocated for the most informative search lines than previously and more energy to the less informative lines . after shifting ever more resources from the informative line to other lines , the objective ,",

    "the experiment concentrates on one heuristic and its effect on the search is highly significant .      in order to solve deep combinations where",
