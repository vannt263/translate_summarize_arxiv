    "social network models @xcite are statistical models for the joint occurrence of random edges in a graph , as a means to model social interactions among agents in a population of interest .",
    "these models typically focus on representing only _ binary _ relations between individuals . as a result , when one is interested in higher - order ( @xmath0-ary ) interactions , statistical models based on graphs may be ineffective or inadequate .",
    "examples of @xmath0-ary relations are plentiful , and include forum or committee membership , co - authorship on scientific papers , or proximity of groups of people in photographs .",
    "these datasets have been studied by replacing each @xmath0-dimensional group with a number of binary relations ( in particular , @xmath1 of them , which form a clique ) , thus extracting binary information from the data , and then modeling and studying the resulting graph .",
    "such a process inevitably causes information loss .",
    "for instance , let us consider statisticians adam ( @xmath2 ) , barbara ( @xmath3 ) , cassandra ( @xmath4 ) , and david ( @xmath5 ) , see figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "suppose the authors wrote three papers in following groups : @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "representing this information as a graph with edges between any two individuals who have co - authored a paper provides a graph @xmath9 with edges @xmath10 .",
    "a hypergraph @xmath11 representing this information would instead use the exact groups as hyperedges and , unlike @xmath9 , would be able to represent additional properties of such interactions , including how many papers were coauthored by these four individuals ; see figure  [ fig1 ] . if , in addition , @xmath2 is more likely to write a 3-author paper than a 2-author paper , this requires modeling separately the probabilities of these collaborations . despite the growing needs of practical values , models for random hypergraphs are relatively few and simple .",
    "random hypergraphs have been studied ( @xcite ) as generalizations of the simple erds - rnyi model @xcite for networks ; @xcite considers an application of random tripartite hypergraphs to flickr photo - tag data .",
    "and @xmath12 reduced to same graph @xmath9 ( left , right , middle ) . ]    in this paper we introduce a simple and natural class of statistical models for random hypergraphs , which we term hypergraph beta models , that allows one to model directly simultaneous higher - order ( and not only binary ) interactions among individuals in a network .",
    "as its name suggests , our model arises as a natural extension of the well - studied beta model for random graphs , the exponential family for undirected networks which assumes independent edges and whose minimal sufficient statistics vector is the degree sequence of the graph .",
    "it is a special class of the more general of @xmath13 models @xcite which assume independent edges and parametrize the probability of each edge by the propensity of the two endpoint nodes .",
    "this model has been studied extensively ; see @xcite , which give , among other results , methods for model fitting .",
    "below we formalize the class of the beta models for hypergraphs . just like the graph beta model , these are natural exponential random graph models over hypergraphs which postulate independent edges and whose sufficient statistics are the ( hypergraph ) degree sequences .",
    "our contributions are two - fold : first we formalize three classes of linear exponential families for random hypergraphs of increasing degree of complexity and derive the corresponding sufficient statistics and moment equations for obtaining the maximum likelihood estimator ( mle ) of the model parameters .",
    "secondly , we design two iterative algorithms for fitting these models that do not require evaluating the gradient or hessian of the likelihood function and can therefore be applied to large data : a variant of the ips algorithm and a fixed point iterative algorithm to compute the mle of the edge probabilities and of the natural parameters , respectively .",
    "we show that both algorithms will converge if the mle exists .",
    "finally , we illustrate our results and methods with some simulations .",
    "as our analysis reveals , the study of the theoretical and asymptotic properties of hypergraph beta models is especially challenging , more so than with the ordinary beta model .",
    "the complexity of the new models , in turn , leads to the problem of optimizing a complex likelihood function .",
    "indeed , when the mle does not exist , optimizing the likelihood function becomes highly non - trivial and , to a large extent , unsolved for our model as well as for many other discrete linear exponential families . to this end",
    ", we describe a geometric way for dealing with the issue of existence of the mle for these models and gain further insights into this difficult problem with simulation experiments .",
