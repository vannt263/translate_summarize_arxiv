    "we will work in units where the lattice constant satisfies @xmath80 .    in equilibrium ,",
    "the green s functions are straightforward to solve because the system consists of noninteracting electrons on a lattice with a basis . in nonequilibrium",
    ", one needs to properly include the time dependence , which is easiest to do with _ a time - independent basis _ for the creation and annihilation operators ( otherwise one needs to take into account the derivative of how the basis changes with time ) . in momentum space , the time - evolution operator @xmath81 is a @xmath82 matrix that satisfies the following equations : @xmath83   , \\ ] ] @xmath84   , \\ ] ] @xmath85 with @xmath86 the ordering wavevector for the cdw .",

    "note that because we use an exact expression for the exponential of the @xmath82 matrix that appears in the time - ordered product , the evolution operator is always unitary ( even for large @xmath90 ) , although the accuracy is still determined by the size of @xmath90 .",

    "we find , however , that we can fit the green s function over a wide range of times by the form @xmath99 with a similar result for the real part .",
    "we extrapolate the fits out to @xmath100 and then perform the fourier transform for the results in fig .  2 of the main text .",
    "the lesser green s function has a more complicated form because it does depend on the history of the evolution of the system and hence does not depend solely on evolution operators between times @xmath19 and @xmath20 , but rather depends on the evolution operators from a distant time in the past up to time @xmath19 and time @xmath20 .",
    "the formula for it is not too enlightening and is cumbersome , so we show it only for the @xmath101 or @xmath102 component ( other cases follow similarly from a simple substitution of the evolution operators into the definition of the lesser green s function ) : @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the initial time , and the four different expectation values are taken in the initial equilibrium state before the field is turned on .    the time - resolved pes response function is calculated as a probe pulse weighted relative time fourier transform of the lesser green s function centered at time @xmath105 , @xmath106 where the response must be calculated for each sublattice ( the experimental response will be the average over both sublattices ) .",

    "the narrower the probe pulse width , the better the time resolution and the worse the energy resolution , and _ vice versa _ for broader probe pulses .",
    "we also calculate the current , the total energy , and the occupancy in the upper / lower bands of the instantaneous band structure .",
    "the formulas for these quantities can be expressed as equal time expectation values , which can be found in a straightforward fashion from the equal time lesser green s function .",

    "<S> recent experiments in ultrafast pump / probe spectroscopy that investigated layered cdw materials , have revealed a new nonequilibrium paradigm where long - range cdw order persists but , by conventional interpretation , the local electronic excitation spectrum becomes gapless ( by creating subgap states ) for a transient period of time @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the similarity of these experiments to each other for quite different materials points towards a quasi - universal behavior in nonequilibrium , whose main features are captured with a simple exactly solvable model that we present below .    we concentrate on two materials that have been measured experimentally . </S>",

    "<S> a pump / probe core - level x - ray photoemission spectroscopy experiment @xcite further shows that the amplitude of the electronic cdw order parameter ( given by the difference of the electric charge density on the different sublattices of the cdw ) is reduced by the pulse , but does not vanish ; it eventually settles into a long - time value that is reduced from the original size due to heating of the system and relaxation back to equilibrium . _ hence , unlike in equilibrium , experiments show that the electronic cdw order parameter and the gap in the electronic energy spectrum become partially decoupled in the sense that the gap collapses while residual modulated cdw order remains_.    this change in character of the many - body state has been named a nonequilibrium melting ( or phase transition ) of the cdw but it has an inherently different character from the equilibrium phase transitions . for example , the gap is initially fragile to the presence of an electric field while the electronic order parameter is initially robust ( due to the frozen in lattice distortion yielding an inhomogeneous potential for the electrons ) , so the behavior of the system during the transient closing of the gap lies in a different physical realm than does the equilibrium phase transition .    </S>",

    "<S> the long - time behavior of our system resembles this hot - electron model ( even though we have no scattering that gives rise to thermalisation ) , but the most interesting regime is the short - time transient one where properties change most rapidly in time and are not described by such simplifications .    before introducing the simplified model for the cdw , </S>",

    "<S> while this exact solution does not capture all of the quantitative details of the experiments ( particularly when coupling of electrons to phonons becomes important ) , for short and intermediate times , it provides a consistent qualitative explanation of the experimental data and is consistent with the emergence of a quasi - universal behavior in nonequilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> the timescale for the reopening of the gap is smaller in this model than in experiment because we have not included a phonon bath that couples to the electrons via the electron - phonon coupling . </S>",
    "<S> this allows for an oscillating transfer of energy back and forth between electrons and phonons , until they are damped . when the phonons transfer energy back to the electrons , it is similar to repumping the electrons by an external pulse , which we believe is why the gap remains closed for longer time in experiments .    </S>",
