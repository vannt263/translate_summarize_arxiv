    "since the beginning of quantum mechanics , the hydrogen atom has been one of the best studied models in physics @xcite . in a large number of textbooks and monographs , therefore , its ( well  known ) solutions from either the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation or dirac s ( relativistic ) wave equation have served as standard examples in introducing atomic theory .",
    "but apart from the educational insight as obtained from the _ hydrogen atom model _ , the theory of the one  electron atoms and ions has found its way also into quite different fields of modern physics including molecular and plasma physics , quantum optics , or the theory of quantum information . when combined with the _ atomic shell model _ , i.e.  the successive filling of shells as established for instance by the periodic table of elements , the ( analytical ) solutions of the  hydrogen atom ",
    "help understand many atomic processes in nature , at least qualitatively . during the last decades ,",
    "moreover , dirac s theory of the hydrogen  like ions has been applied successfully for describing energetic collisions of high  z ions with atomic targets @xcite or for testing quantum  electrodynamical ( qed ) effects @xcite , if furry s picture and field  theoretical concepts are taken into account .    as seen from this wide  spread use of the hydrogen atom model , therefore , a fast and interactive access to the solutions and properties of the one ",
    "electron ions is highly desirable . in the past",
    ", several program have been developed and implemented into the cpc program library for calculating the hydrogenic wave and green s functions , both within the nonrelativistic @xcite and relativistic @xcite framework .",
    "beside of providing these functions explicitly , they have been implemented also  at least to a certain extent  in a large number of further codes including those for studying the two  photon ionization of hydrogen  like ions @xcite , their interaction with lasers @xcite and electrons @xcite , the excitation and ionization of such ions by coulomb fields @xcite , their bound  bound transitions in the presence of external magnetic fields @xcite , and at many places elsewhere .",
    "but although these programs have certainly found useful for understanding the properties and behaviour of one  electron atoms and ions , they have two drawbacks in common which restrict their further application : since these programs are designed for a very particular task , they often ( i ) can not be extended so easily to other problems . moreover , by using standard languages such as fortran or c , these programs do ( ii ) not support any algebraic ( symbolic ) access to the wave functions and matrix element as required by more advanced studies .",
    "the lack of symbolic techniques , in particular , and together with the low flexibility in dealing with the input and output of the programs from above have hampered their use for a much wider range of applications .",
    "today , a new and promising alternative for having an algebraic access to complex ( symbolic ) expressions is offered by computer algebra including the general purpose systems such as mathematica or maple . in the last decade",
    ", they have been increasingly utilized to provide a fast and reliable gateway to a large set of complex expressions and computations . with the development of the program , we here provide a set of maple procedures for studying the properties and the dynamical behaviour of the hydrogen  like ions . in the past two years , this program has been used to support not only the interpretation of experiments but also for a detailed analysis of the polarization and correlation properties of the x  ray radiation as emitted by relativistic collisions @xcite . owing to its interactive design , moreover , the program may help the user not only in his or her daily research work but also in teaching the physics of ( hydrogen  like ) atoms and ions .",
    "obviously , however , a program about the _ hydrogen atom model _ can neither be implemented comprehensively nor explained within a single step .",
    "therefore , the package will be presented in several steps , each of them dedicated to a well defined part of the theory . to provide access to the very basic elements of the theory , here",
    "we first describe a set of procedures for the symbolic ( as well as numerical ) computation of the wave and green s functions .",
    "these functions are provided for both , the bound and continuum  state solutions of the nonrelativistic as well as relativistic theory .",
    "having once a simple access to these functions , of course , they can be rather easily applied to construct the transitions amplitudes and matrix elements for a large number of other properties . for several",
    " frequently required  matrix elements , an algebraic evaluation of the radial integrals has been implemented also explicitly .",
    "although the main purpose of this work is to describe the design and the use of the package , in the next section we first compile the basic equations and expressions from the theory of the hydrogen atom with emphasis on those which have been implemented in the code . in section [ s : lib - descr ] , we later describe the organization of the program and how it is distributed .",
    "this sections also lists all the user ",
    "accessible commands together with a short description , while a detailed explanation of the parameters , optional arguments and some additional information for each procedure is given in an additional user manual and is appended to the code .",
    "this is followed in section [ examples ] by a number of selected examples to illustrate the interactive use of the program within its maple environment . a short outlook onto future developments and extensions of the program",
    "is finally given in section [ outlook ] .",
    "since the quantum  mechanical theory of the one  electron atoms has been worked out long time ago , both within the nonrelativistic and relativistic framework , we may refer for most details to the literature .",
    "helpful introductions into this topic can be found , for instance , in the texts by bethe and salpeter @xcite , messiah @xcite , bransden and joachain @xcite , eichler and meyerhof @xcite , and by many others . in the present work , therefore , we will restrict ourselves to rather a short compilation of the basic expressions , just enough in order to introduce the notations and formulas as implemented within the program . in the following two subsections [ theory_wave_functions ] and [ theory_green_functions ] ,",
    "in particular , we briefly recall the ( analytically well known ) radial  angular representation of the hydrogen wave and green s functions which are later applied in subsection [ theory_integrals ] for evaluating a number of radial integrals .",

    "<S> although various special functions , such as the laguerre polynomials , spherical harmonics , whittaker functions , or the hypergeometric functions of various kinds can be used in most cases in order to express these amplitudes in a concise form , their derivation is time consuming and prone for making errors . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to their complexity , moreover , there exist a large number of mathematical relations among these functions which are difficult to remember in detail and which have often hampered quantitative studies in the past .    </S>",
    "<S> _ method of solution : _ a set of maple procedures is developed which provides both the nonrelativistic and relativistic ( analytical ) solutions of the  hydrogen atom model  and which facilitates the symbolic evaluation of various transition amplitudes .    </S>",
    "<S> _ restrictions onto the complexity of the problem : _ over the past decades , a large number of representations have been worked out for the hydrogenic wave and green s functions , using different variables and coordinates [ 2 ] . from these , the position  space representation in spherical coordinates is certainly of most practical interest and has been used as the basis of the present implementation . </S>",
    "<S> no attempt has been made by us so far to provide the wave and green s functions also in momentum space , for which the relativistic momentum functions would have to be constructed numerically .    </S>",
    "<S> although the program supports both symbolic and numerical computations , the latter one are based on maple s standard _ software _ floating  </S>",
    "<S> point algorithms and on the ( attempted ) precision as defined by the global digits variable . </S>",
    "<S> although the default number , digits = 10 , appears sufficient for many computations , it often leads to a rather dramatic loss in the accuracy of the relativistic wave functions and integrals , mainly owing to maple s imprecise internal evaluation of the corresponding special functions . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in order to avoid such computational difficulties , the digits variable is set to 20 whenever the program is ( re)loaded .    </S>",
    "<S> _ unusual features of the program : _ the program has been designed for interactive work which , apart from the standard solutions and integrals of the hydrogen atom , also support the use of ( approximate ) _ semirelativistic _ wave functions for both , the bound and continuum states of the electron . to provide a fast and accurate access to a number of radial integrals which arise frequently in applications , </S>",
    "<S> the analytical expressions for these integrals have been implemented for the one  particle operators @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 as well as for the ( so  called ) two  particle slater integrals which are needed to describe the coulomb repulsion among the electrons </S>",
    "<S> . further procedures of the program concern , for instance , the conversion of the physical results between different unit systems or for different sets of quantum numbers . </S>",
    "<S> a brief description of all procedures as available in the present version of the program is given in the user manual ` dirac-commands.pdf ` which is distributed together with the code .    </S>",
    "<S> _ typical running time : _ although the program replies _ promptly _ on most requests , the running time also depends on the particular task .    _ </S>",
