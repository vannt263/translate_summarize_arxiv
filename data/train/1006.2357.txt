    "the thermodynamics of strong interactions for cold matter under extremely high densities is of utmost importance for the understanding of the structure of compact stars @xcite . since quantum chromodynamics ( qcd )",
    "is asymptotically free , it is believed that for high enough densities quarks will be in a deconfined state , the quark - gluon plasma @xcite . moreover , due to the approximately chiral nature of the qcd action , one also expects quarks to be essentially massless above a sufficiently high value of the chemical potential .",
    "depending on the location of the critical density , one might find several sorts of condensates and even deconfined quark matter in the core of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the order and strength of the chiral transition are crucial features in establishing the existence of a new class of compact stars @xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown that deconfinement can happen early , during the early post - bounce accretion stage of a core collapse supernova event , which could result not only in a delayed explosion but also in a neutrino burst that could provide a signal of the presence of quark matter in compact stars @xcite . however , as was discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) those possibilities depend on the actual dynamics of phase conversion , more specifically on the time scales that emerge . in a first - order phase transition , as is expected to be the case in qcd at very low temperatures , the process is guided by bubble nucleation ( usually slow ) or spinodal decomposition ( `` explosive '' due to the vanishing barrier ) , depending on how fast the system reaches the spinodal instability as compared to the nucleation rate .",
    "nucleation in relatively high - density , cold strongly interacting matter , with chemical potential of the order of the temperature , can also play an important role in the scenario proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a second ( little ) inflation at the time of the primordial quark - hadron transition could account for the dilution of an initially high ratio of baryon to photon numbers .",
    "a key ingredient in both scenarios is , of course , the surface tension , since it represents the price in energy one has to pay for the mere existence of a given bubble ( or droplet ) .    however , the surface tension and the whole process of phase conversion via nucleation in a cold and dense environment are not known for strong interactions . in fact , the mapping of this sector of the ( equilibrium ) phase diagram is still in its infancy @xcite , let alone dynamical processes of phase conversion .",
    "this region of the phase diagram is not very amenable to first - principle approaches . on one hand",
    ", the so - called sign problem at finite chemical potential brings about major technical difficulties for performing monte carlo lattice simulations , so that one still does not have the high - quality guidance from lattice qcd that is currently available at finite temperature and zero density @xcite . on the other hand , although the perturbative series for qcd at zero temperature and finite density seems to be much better behaved than its counterpart at finite temperature @xcite , the values of chemical potential that are phenomenologically interesting in the interior of compact stars are already too low , of the order of @xmath4mev @xcite . at this scale ,",
    "one is certainly pushing perturbative qcd much beyond its limits of applicability . besides , this approach is incapable of incorporating the chiral and the deconfinement transitions , as well as vacuum properties , unless it is merged with a complementary low - density treatment .",
    "therefore , an estimate of the surface tension and the description of the nucleation process within an effective model for strong interactions in a cold and dense environment seems welcome .    in this paper",
    "we consider the linear sigma model coupled with constituent quarks ( lsmq ) at zero or low temperature and finite quark chemical potential as a model for the thermodynamics of strong interactions in cold and dense matter .",
    "we compute the effective action for the sigma condensate integrating over the quark fields and keeping quadratic fluctuations of the sigma field around the condensate .",
    "our final thermodynamic potential incorporates all corrections from the medium and vacuum fluctuations in the @xmath0 scheme , including logarithmic and scale - dependent contributions from quark and sigma bubble - diagrams .",
    "renormalization is implemented in the standard fashion in the @xmath0 scheme . knowing the full thermodynamic potential",
    ", we study the behavior of the chiral condensate with chemical potential , the location and nature of the chiral transition , and the process of homogeneous nucleation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii presents the lsmq and some of its features , and the analytic computation of the one - loop effective potential at finite chemical potential , including quantum logarithmic corrections in the vaccum and thermal effects . in section iii",
    "we show our results for the surface tension and other relevant quantities for the nucleation process , analyzing the competition between vacuum and thermal modifications and discussing the consequences for the supernovae explosion scenario .",
    "section iv contains our conclusions and outlook .",
    "the lsmq , also known as the quark - meson model , is very suitable for the study of the chiral transition @xcite . as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , qcd with two flavors of massless quarks belongs to the same universality class as the @xmath5 lsm , exhibiting the same qualitative behavior at criticality . besides , the lsm is renormalizable @xcite and reproduces correctly the phenomenology of qcd at low energies , such as the spontaneous ( and small explicit ) breaking of chiral symmetry , meson masses , etc . in spite of the fact that an effective theory does not require renormalizability to be well posed ,",
    "this attribute is highly desirable if one is interested in investigating the behavior of physical quantities as the energy scale is modified , which can be accomplished via renormalization group methods .    since its proposal @xcite",
    ", the lsm has been investigated in different contexts , from the low - energy nuclear theory of nucleon - meson interactions to ultra - relativistic high - energy heavy - ion collisions , and also in different varieties , e.g. including explicitly constituent quark degrees of freedom or not .",
    "the thermodynamical aspects of the model were first considered in the very early days of finite - temperature field theory @xcite , and systematic approximations for the study of the chiral transition started to be implemented soon afterwards @xcite , producing an extensive literature .    when used to mimic and study the chiral transition of qcd , the emphasis was generally on thermal effects @xcite rather than considering a cold and dense scenario , although chiral symmetry restoration at high densities was predicted quite early @xcite .",
    "this choice was , of course , well justified by the stimulating experimental results coming from high - energy heavy - ion collisions @xcite , and by the possibility to compare to numerical output from lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "usually the gas of quarks is treated as a thermal bath in which the long - wavelength modes of the chiral field evolve , the latter playing the role of an order parameter in a landau - ginzburg approach .",
    "the standard procedure is then integrating over the fermionic degrees of freedom , using a classical approximation for the chiral field , to obtain a formal expression for the thermodynamic potential from which one can compute all the physical quantities of interest . in this case , the sigma field is approximated by the condensate , and the functional integral over sigma fluctuations is not performed .",
    "the fermionic determinant is usually calculated to one - loop order assuming a homogeneous and static background field @xcite .    in a theory with spontaneous symmetry breaking , the presence of a condensate will modify the masses .",
    "in particular , in the case of the lsmq the masses of quarks and mesons will incorporate corrections that are functions of the chiral condensate , which is a medium - dependent quantity .",
    "therefore , contributions from vacuum diagrams can not be subtracted away as trivial zero - point energies since they contain medium - dependent pieces via effective masses .",
    "so , although the presence of the medium brings no new ultraviolet divergence , in principle one has to incorporate carefully finite vacuum contributions that survive the renormalization procedure .",
    "these contributions have been very often discarded in studies of the lsmq , but were shown to play an important role by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite who incorporate scale effects phenomenologically .",
    "vacuum contributions were considered at finite density in the perturbative massive yukawa model with analytic exact results up to two loops in ref .",
    "@xcite and , more specifically , in optimized perturbation theory at finite temperature and chemical potential in ref .",
    "@xcite , also comparing to mean - field theory .",
    "more recently , this issue was discussed in a comparison with the nambu - jona  lasinio model @xcite , in the polyakov - lsmq model in the presence of an external magnetic field @xcite , and in the quark - meson model , with special attention to the chiral limit @xcite . to describe the chiral phase structure of strong interactions at finite density and vanishing temperature we adopt the lsmq , defined by the following lagrangian @xmath6\\psi_f \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial _",

    "the @xmath8 massive fermion fields @xmath9 represent the up and down constituent - quark fields @xmath10 . for simplicity",
    ", we attribute the same mass , @xmath11 , to both quarks .",
    "the scalar field @xmath12 plays the role of an approximate order parameter for the chiral transition , being an exact order parameter for massless quarks and pions .",
    "the latter are represented by the pseudoscalar field @xmath13 .",
    "it is customary to group together these meson fields into a @xmath5 chiral field @xmath14 . for simplicity",
    ", we discard the pion dynamics from the outset , knowing that they do not affect appreciably the phase conversion process @xcite , and focus our discussion in the quark - sigma sector of the theory .",
    "nevertheless , pion vacuum properties will be needed to fix the parameters of the lagrangian later .",
    "as will be discussed below , the parameters of the lagrangian are chosen such that the effective model reproduces correctly the phenomenology of qcd at low energies and in the vacuum , such as the spontaneous ( and small explicit ) breaking of chiral symmetry and experimentally measured meson masses .",
    "since chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken in the vacuum , it is convenient to expand the @xmath12 field around the condensate , writing @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the imaginary time in the matsubara finite - temperature formalism .",
    "although we assume the system to be at temperature @xmath17 , it is convenient to compute the loop expansion at finite temperature , taking the limit @xmath18 at the end . for a dense system",
    ", the chiral condensate , @xmath19 , will be a function of the quark chemical potential , @xmath20 . given the shift above , the fluctuation field @xmath21 is such that @xmath22 and @xmath23 . from the phenomenology",
    ", one expects that @xmath24 ( being equal in the case of massless quarks ) .    keeping terms",
    "up to @xmath25 , one obtains the following effective lagrangian @xmath26\\psi_f \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac{1}{2}\\partial _ { \\mu}\\xi \\partial ^{\\mu}\\xi   -\\frac{1}{2}m_\\sigma^2\\xi^2 - u(\\langle\\sigma\\rangle)\\ ; , \\label{effective_lagrangian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined the @xmath20-dependent effective masses @xmath27 linear terms in @xmath21 can be dropped in the action because of the condition @xmath23 .    in the effective lagrangian",
    ", the medium - dependent masses will entangle vacuum and medium contributions in the loop expansion , rendering the renormalization process more subtle .",
    "this is a consequence of the presence of a nonzero @xmath20-dependent condensate in the broken phase . of course , the ultraviolet divergences are the ones of the theory in the vacuum , and renormalization is implemented in the standard fashion by adding medium - independent counterterms to the original lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) . in our case , though , it is more convenient to introduce counterterms in the effective theory , so that there are contributions from pure - vacuum , pure - medium and vacuum - medium pieces in the cancellation of ultraviolet divergences .",
    "renormalization is then implemented by using standard methods of finite - temperature field theory @xcite .      the effective potential can be computed exactly and in closed form following the steps detailed in ref .",
    "@xcite , a procedure that can be even generalized to optimized perturbation theory @xcite . keeping only contributions to one loop order ,",
    "the effective potential is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the fully - renormalized thermodynamic potential for the fluctuation effective theory .",
    "the latter corresponds to a yukawa theory for massive fermions and a massive scalar , with masses given by ( [ masses ] ) as functions of @xmath30 .",
    "the thermodynamics of this theory was fully solved analytically to two loops in the cold and dense regime in ref .",

    "the latter can also be fixed by vacuum properties , as will be discussed in subsection [ parfix ] .",
    "we can also incorporate thermal effects in the calculation of the effective potential within the lsmq .",

    "the incorporation of such corrections in the calculation of the effective potential can be implemented via the perturbative technique order by order .",
    "the first interaction correction in the present case appears at the two - loop order .",

    "however , since our ultimate interest is investigating the formation of quark matter in astrophysical processes involving ultra - compact objects , the framework most suited is exactly one that describes the high - energy transitions of strong interactions , namely chiral restoration and/or deconfinement .",
    "we choose therefore the lsmq and analyze the nucleation of chirally - symmetric droplets in a strongly interacting medium .    in order to interpret the results for the nucleation parameters",
    ", one should keep in mind the variation of the metastable regions and its implication on the value of chemical potential that needs to be reached above the respective criticality , i.e. the amount of supercompression .",
    "figure [ all - rc - fig ] shows the variation of the radius of the critical bubble , while figure [ all - ratio - fig ] displays the correlation length ( or equivalently the approximate width of the bubble wall ) for the three cases .",
    "a direct consequence of the shifting of the metastable domain is the fact that , for fixed chemical potential , the critical radius decreases significantly both when one includes quantum vacuum corrections ( curve @xmath122 ) or in the presence of thermal effects ( curve @xmath123 ) .",
    "however , the amount of supercompression needed for reaching a certain viable value of critical radius clearly increases when one includes quantum corrections and decreases in the case with thermal corrections .",
    "therefore , there is a nontrivial competition between those effects : while quark matter nucleation is disfavored by the inclusion of quantum vacuum corrections , it is favored by thermal corrections to the nucleation parameters .    0.2 cm   and the critical radius @xmath89 as a function of the quark chemical potential in the cold and dense lsm ( curve @xmath121 ) , including vacuum terms ( curve @xmath122 ) and thermal corrections ( curve @xmath123).,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    0.2 cm ) , including vacuum terms ( curve @xmath122 ) and thermal corrections ( curve @xmath123).,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    the competition between vacuum and thermal corrections is more explicitly shown by our findings for the surface tension , displayed in figure [ all - sigma - fig ] . as compared to the zero - temperature , classical computation ( curve @xmath121 ) , the establishment of a interface between quark matter droplets and the hadronic medium costs more with the incorporation of quantum corrections in the effective potential . on the other hand , finite temperature terms tend to push the surface tension down , reaching a minimum of only @xmath127mev / fm@xmath61 , facilitating the surface formation .",
    "therefore , if the environment in the core of a compact object is cold enough and if the effective theory including quantum corrections in the vacuum is the most suited for describing the chiral transition , then the surface tension can be as high as @xmath128mev / fm@xmath61 near criticality rendering quark matter nucleation much slower and even an improbable phenomenon",
    ".    0.2 cm ) , including vacuum terms ( curve @xmath122 ) and thermal corrections ( curve @xmath123).,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    analogous results for the nucleation rate @xmath129 can be seen in figure [ all - gamma - fig ] .",
    "once again , the amount of supercompression associated with a given chemical potential should be kept in mind .",
    "the nucleation rate falls abruptly for chemical potentials approaching the respective critical values . in the vicinity of the spinodals ,",
    "the nucleation rate is dominated by the pre - exponential factor and reaches sizable values , around @xmath130mev/@xmath131 .      to contribute to the investigation of the possibility of nucleating quark matter droplets during the early post - bounce stage of core collapse supernovae",
    ", we follow ref . @xcite and define the nucleation time as being the time it takes for the nucleation of a single critical bubble inside a volume of @xmath132km@xmath133 , which is typical of the core of a protoneutron star , i.e. @xmath134    0.2 cm   km@xmath133 in the cold and dense lsm ( curve @xmath121 ) , including vacuum terms ( curve @xmath122 ) and thermal corrections ( curve @xmath123).,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    fig .",
    "[ all - tau - fig ] shows this quantity as a function of the normalized chemical potential for the three scenarios considered in this analysis .",
    "the relevant time scale to compare is the time interval the system takes from the critical chemical potential to the spinodal during the supernova event , if it ever reaches such high densities in practice .",
    "implicit in the definition above is the approximation of constant density and temperature over the core , which is fine for an estimate , since density profiled are quite flat in this region of the star .",
    "the typical time scale for the early post - bounce phase is of the order of a fraction of a second , so that the time within the metastable region is smaller , in the ballpark of milliseconds .    keeping these simplifications in mind , together with the caveat that the lsmq does not describe nuclear matter besides the chiral properties of strong interactions , we show in fig .",
    "9 that vacuum corrections tend to increase the density depth required for efficient nucleation whereas thermal corrections push in the opposite direction , consistently with the results discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "our results for the nucleation time , together with those for the surface tension , tend to favor the best scenario for nucleation of quark matter in the supernova explosion scenario considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , especially when thermal corrections with physical temperatures are included . to a great measure",
    ", this happens because the nucleation time , and the whole process of phase conversion , depends very strongly on the surface tension , since it enters cubed in the boltzmann exponential of the rate @xmath129 .",
    "in this paper we have computed the effective potential for the linear sigma model with quarks in the @xmath0 scheme at zero or low temperature and finite quark chemical potential , including vacuum and medium fluctuations .",
    "we have discussed the issues related to the vacuum contributions and the parameter fixing in the presence of these corrections .",
    "having the full effective potential , we studied homogeneous nucleation in a framework that allowed for analytic calculations , given by a potential fit by a quartic polynomial and the thin - wall approximation .",
    "all the relevant quantities were computed as functions of the chemical potential ( or the baryonic density ) , the key function being the surface tension .    the value of the surface tension for the qcd phase transitions could actually play important roles in different physical phenomena .",
    "as discussed above , if this value is small enough , quark - matter formation could occur during core - collapse supernovae explosions , providing an alternative dynamics and even an observable signal of the qcd phase transition within compact objects .",
    "moreover , a reasonably small surface tension between partonic and hadronic phases could also contribute to allow for different compact star structures including mixed phases , as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "estimates for the surface tension between a quark phase and hadron matter were considered previously in different contexts . in a study of the minimal interface between a color - flavor locked phase and nuclear matter in a first order transition , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite use dimensional analysis and obtain @xmath135mev/@xmath3 assuming that the transition occurs within a fermi in thickness .",
    "taking into account the effects from charge screening and structured mixed phases , the authors of ref . @xcite",
    "provide estimates in the range of @xmath136mev/@xmath3 but do not exclude smaller or larger values .",
    "in this paper we computed the surface tension as a function of quark chemical potential ( or as a function of baryon density ) within the linear sigma model , isolating the role played by quantum vacuum terms and thermal corrections .",
    "in particular , we show that the model predicts a surface tension of @xmath1@xmath2mev/@xmath3 , rendering nucleation of quark matter possible during the early post - bounce stage of core collapse supernovae . including temperature effects and vacuum logarithmic corrections , we find a clear competition between these features in characterizing the dynamics of the chiral phase conversion , so that if the temperature is low enough the consistent inclusion of vacuum corrections could help preventing the nucleation of quark matter during the early post - bounce stage of core collapse supernovae .    as discussed in subsection [ int ] , effects from interactions between the sigma field and the quarks that come about at two - loop order could in principle contribute to this competition as a third sizable modification and should be investigated as well .",
    "the linear sigma model , however , does not contain essential ingredients to describe nuclear matter , e.g. it does not reproduce features such as the saturation density and the binding energy . therefore , the results obtained in this paper should be considered with caution when applied to compact stars or the early universe .",
    "it is an effective theory for a first - order chiral phase transition in cold and dense strongly interacting matter , and allows for a clean calculation of the physical quantities that are relevant for homogeneous nucleation in the process of phase conversion . in the spirit of an effective model description",
    ", our results should be viewed as estimates that indicate that the surface tension is reasonably low and falls with baryon density , as one increases the supercompression .",
    "first - principle calculations in qcd in this domain are probably out of reach in the near future .",
    "therefore , estimates within other effective models would be very welcome .",
