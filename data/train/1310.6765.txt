    "frustrated magnets have a number of highly fascinating properties which have been the focus of intense research interest for some time .",
    "these include magnets which do not order but where a macroscopic number of competing low lying states give rise to strong correlations and a large low - temperature entropy , or spin - liquids where quantum fluctuations prevent ordering and exotic quasi - particles appear , see ref .",

    "a much simpler situation arises in classical magnets if the frustration is not sufficiently strong to prevent an ordered ground state . in this case",
    "the ground state has a broken symmetry and the low temperature excitations are just spin waves .",
    "however , even classical frustrated magnets which do order are not completely understood , which can be attributed to a large part to a non - trivial order parameter which characterizes such magnets . in @xmath0 , as was first pointed out by kawamura and miyashita,@xcite the order parameter manifold of a frustrated heisenberg magnet allows for point - like topological @xmath1 defects and the influence of these defects on the properties of the magnet at finite temperatures proved very difficult to quantify . in @xmath2",
    "collinear xy magnets topological defects are responsible for the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition",
    ". however , in this case the perturbative @xmath3-function of the xy coupling constant , which is sensitive only to the geometry but not the topology of the order parameter space , vanishes .",
    "this is very different from the situation in frustrated heisenberg magnets .",
    "the major difficulty with @xmath2 frustrated heisenberg magnets is the combined presence of both point - like defects , originating from the topological properties of the order parameter space,@xcite and the phenomenon of asymptotic freedom which has its root in the local geometry of the order parameter space .",
    "in contrast to collinear xy magnets , where the villain approximation allows to map the problem on the @xmath2 coulomb gas which can be well studied using rg techniques,@xcite no similar tool is available for frustrated heisenberg models . the yet unsolved question is whether or not a finite temperature transition exists in frustrated heisenberg magnets . in particular , for the simplest such model , the heisenberg antiferromagnet on a triangular lattice ( haft ) , this question has been addressed repeatedly over the years , without a definite conclusion .",
    "monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of the haft have found indications of a vortex unbinding at a finite temperature @xmath4.@xcite the vorticity modulus , which measures the response of the magnet to an imposed twist along a path which encloses a vortex core , has been shown to vanish@xcite at @xmath4 .",
    "further indications of a finite temperature transition can be found from the phase diagram of the haft in a magnetic field.@xcite in small fields , there are two finite temperature transitions .",
    "there is a bkt transition from a low temperature canted state with quasi - long - range order of the transverse spin - components to an intermediate state which has a vanishing spin stiffness .",
    "a second transition at higher temperatures restores the sub - lattice symmetry of the magnet , which is broken in both low temperature phases .",
    "it is unclear from mc what happens in the zero field limit , but both transitions are of the order of @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 is antiferromagnetic exchange constant ) for very small fields , a similar temperature to where at zero field a vortex unbinding seems to occur . in a perturbative rg analysis some indication of a fixed point in @xmath0 which might correspond to a topological phase transition were reported,@xcite see however also ref .",
    "[ ] . experimentally , there are also several reports on indications of a vortex driven transition.@xcite    perhaps the cleanest demonstration of the role of topology comes from a comparison of mc simulations of two different matrix models representing interacting tops , which both share the same geometrical properties but differ in their topology.@xcite the model which allows for topological defects shows a clear finite temperature peak in the specific heat and a crossover in the correlation length dependence on @xmath7 which are both absent in the topological trivial model .",

    "the advantage of using a landau - ginzburg model in conjunction with a non - perturbative rg ( nprg ) approach is its ability to describe the bkt transition of the @xmath2 xy model , without relying on a mapping to the coulomb gas.@xcite although it is not well understood how exactly topology enters the nprg flow , its success in the study of the xy model makes the nprg a promising approach to the physics of @xmath1 defects in frustrated heisenberg models . here , we follow this ansatz and present results for @xmath0 .    in sec .",

    "the subscript @xmath33 in @xmath34 indicates that all parameters entering ( [ eq : effactde ] ) depend on the cutoff scale @xmath33 .",
    "the fields @xmath35 have @xmath36 components ( the same number of components as the lattice spins ) , are orthogonal in the ground state and span the planar order of a frustrated magnet,@xcite such as e.g. the @xmath16 state of the haft .",

    "if both @xmath42 and @xmath43 become very large , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are forced into a configuration where they are orthogonal with fixed length and , for @xmath29 , can be identified with the @xmath46 and @xmath47 fields of the nlsm , after a suitable rescaling such that both @xmath44 , @xmath45 have norm one .",
    "the third field @xmath48 of the nl@xmath8 m is not independent of @xmath46 and @xmath47 but fixed by the relation @xmath49 .",
    "however , to recover correctly the three independent fluctuation terms @xmath50 of the @xmath51 fields within the ginzburg - landau model ( [ eq : effactde ] ) , it is necessary to add the @xmath52-derivative term , which is the only derivative term at fourth order in the fields which directly renormalizes the gapless modes of the model.@xcite a central role is played by the parameter @xmath53 which is the order parameter of the theory .",
    "it gives the magnitude of the ordered magnetization ( the canted 120@xmath54 magnetization ) around which @xmath55 , which corresponds to the local magnetization , fluctuates .",
    "it is initially finite , since the ir modes are cut off , but the further the ir cutoff @xmath33 is reduced , the stronger @xmath53 is suppressed ( for @xmath0 ) .",

    "the triangular af , we have @xmath29 and the fields @xmath35 can be locally related to the microscopic spins of the triangular af .",
    "this is done by partitioning the spins first into plaquettes of three spins , where each of the spins belongs to one of the three sublattices associated with a 120@xmath54 order .",

    "there are two modes with gaps @xmath67 and one with a mass @xmath68 . at any finite temperature",
    "all modes eventually become gapped , however at very small temperatures the ir physics is completely dominated by the @xmath65 modes which are initially gapless .",
    "this low temperature regime is well described by a nl@xmath8 m . in principle",
    "it would also be possible to start our investigation from the paramagnetic phase which has @xmath69 , however , it is then far more difficult to ensure that the symmetries of the model are not violated in the flow .",
    "thus , within the same spirit as in the nl@xmath8 m approach , we assume a local order and investigate how this order is destroyed by fluctuations .",
    "the relation between the nl@xmath8 m and the nprg approach near @xmath0 ( and for any @xmath36 ) has been established in ref .",

    "this derivation was based on a local rigidity constraint where the spins were grouped into local three - spin plaquettes within which they where assumed to be rigid .",
    "we will use these values to fix the derivative terms @xmath84 and @xmath85 in our initial effective action .    while rigid rotations of the spins within a plaquette account for the three initially gapless modes , we can easily understand also the nature of the three gapped modes from looking at a single plaquette if we relax the rigidity constraint . for a local three - spin plaquette",

    "( [ eq : effactde ] ) , and extensions thereof including all local terms up to 10th order in the fields as well as two more additional derivative terms of fourth order , were investigated in refs .",
    "the main objective of that analysis was to clarify the nature of the transition in @xmath102 from the paramagnetic phase to the ordered phase which the authors concluded was most likely of weakly first order both for @xmath103 .",
    "it was further shown that , already within the approximation given in eq .",

    "they did however not discuss in detail the physics in @xmath0 beyond the leading terms which recovers the one - loop nl@xmath8 m result .",

    "first , studies of the bkt transition@xcite have shown that it is important not to truncate in the power of the fields , and we therefore include local terms to arbitrary power in the invariant @xmath55 .",
    "the reason for this is that in @xmath0 all local terms are relevant since in @xmath0 the engineering dimension of the fields vanishes , as measured relative to the gaussian fixed point .",
    "secondly , we extend the terms present in eq .",

    "however , we found that the field expansion to a given finite order does not work very well since the higher order vertices become dominant and drive either @xmath111 or @xmath112 to negative values which leads to a breakdown of the flow at still quite large values of @xmath33 .",
    "this is discussed in appendix [ app : fieldexpansion ] . in the other ,",

    "we then keep the full field dependence of @xmath114 , but approximate @xmath115 by its leading term in a field expansion , @xmath116 this choice is based on the assumption that the @xmath55 dependence of the local potential is more important than the @xmath109 dependence since it controls the symmetry breaking expectation value @xmath53 .",
    "within such an ansatz , one avoids the problems coming from the large higher order terms which appear in a finite order field expansion .",

    "<S> we investigate two - dimensional frustrated heisenberg magnets using non - perturbative renormalization group techniques . </S>",
    "<S> these magnets allow for point - like topological defects which are believed to unbind and drive either a crossover or a phase transition which separates a low temperature , spin - wave dominated regime from a high temperature regime where defects are abundant . </S>",
    "<S> our approach can account for the crossover qualitatively and both the temperature dependence of the correlation length as well as a broad but well defined peak in the specific heat are reproduced . </S>",
    "<S> we find no signatures of a finite temperature transition and an accompanying diverging length scale . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis is consistent with a rapid crossover driven by topological defects .    </S>",
