    "<S> analysis of the @xmath0 plane optical conductivity @xmath1 for both twinned and untwinned yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 as a function of temperature and doping shows that below a well defined temperature @xmath5 a dip in the spectrum systematically appears separating the infrared charge excitation spectrum into two components with distinct energy scales . </S>",
    "<S> the change from monotonic behaviour in @xmath1 is found to be concurrent with the onset of phonon anomalies in raman and infrared spectra below @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the optical data are suggested to be evidence for the appearance of an inhomogeneous distribution of carriers rather than the opening of a simple gap for charge excitations below @xmath7 , an interpretation wich is consistent with recent angle - resoved photoemission and electronic raman spectra . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the behaviour below @xmath7 and the absence of any anomalies at @xmath8 can be interpreted assuming a bose - einstein condensation of preformed pairs .    </S>",
    "<S> following theoretical ideas on inhomogeneous charge carrier distributions and phase separation in cuprate superconductors@xcite , significant experimental support has recently been accumulating for a two - component charge carrier picture , particularly in the underdoped region of the phase diagram of these materials . structural evidence from extendend x - ray absorption fine structure ( exafs)@xcite  and neutron pair distribution function analysis ( pdf)@xcite  as well as nmr , nqr  and mossbauer@xcite spectroscopies@xcite indicate that below a certain cross - over temperature @xmath7 </S>",
    "<S> , the cu - o planes may contain stripes of carrier - rich and carrier - poor regions on length scales typical of the superconducting coherence length @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> these features apparently have quite fast dynamics@xcite making the textures observable only with spectroscopies with sufficiently short characteristic timescales . </S>",
    "<S> although initially the nmr data suggested that the underdoped state may be characterized by a gap primarily for spin excitations , recent angle - resolved photoemission ( arpes)@xcite and time - resolved optical photomodulation data@xcite suggest that some kind of a gap may also be present - at least for parts of the fermi surface - for charge excitations as well . </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of such a pseudogap above @xmath8 appears to be quite a general phenomenon and is observed also in many other systems , including the superconducting bismouthates like ba@xmath10k@xmath11bio@xmath3@xcite , heavy fermion superconductors@xcite and possibly even in the roton excitation spectrum of lhe@xcite , implying a possible common underlying reason for its existence in all these systems .    </S>",
    "<S> however in the case of the cuprates , the data from a key experiment - infrared optical spectroscopy - has not yet been systematically discussed in terms of the above - mentioned picture . although the existence of a  pseudogap  in the out - of - plane optical conductivity @xmath12 has been investigated in some detail@xcite , the in - plane optical data has so far been discussed mainly in terms of a single - component framework of an extended drude model with temperature- and frequency - dependent scattering rate @xmath13 and carrier mass @xmath14@xcite and no systematic analysis of @xmath15 as a function of doping _ and _ temperature has yet been performed .    </S>",
    "<S> it is the purpose of this paper to present an analysis of the available @xmath0 plane optical conductivity data in terms of the two - component picture . </S>",
    "<S> we concentrate primarily on yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 where the data are most complete and the contributions to the optical conductivity arising from the chains and planes can be identified from @xmath0 anisotropy measurements of @xmath16@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis of the doping and temperature dependence of the optical conductivity are performed on published data and unambiguously show that the in - plane optical conductivity qualitatively changes at a characteristic temperature @xmath7 from a single - component spectrum above , to one with ( at least ) two components below @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> these findings together with enumeration of various phonon anomalies in the raman and infrared spectra , collected from the available data apparently confirm the two - component paradigm of the normal state in the underdoped materials below @xmath7 , and define the temperature and frequency dependence of the excitations in the two - component state .    </S>",
    "<S> in common with most near - optimally doped cuprate samples , the real part of the room temperature optical conductivity along the crystallographic @xmath17-axis @xmath18 of yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 below @xmath19 @xmath20 shows a monotonic decrease with increasing frequency reminiscent of an inverse law @xmath21 @xmath22 above this frequency the inverse law fails and an additional spectral weight is necessary to describe the spectra@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> below room temperature ( but still above @xmath8 ) a dip ubiquitously appears in the range 400 - 800 @xmath23 which becomes more pronounced with further cooling and eventually below @xmath8 the residual conductivity shows only a characteristic mid - infrared ( mir ) peak at around 1000 @xmath20 which again is a feature common to all the cuprates . </S>",
    "<S> to analyse this behaviour of @xmath24 more quantitatively , we have selected an arbitrary criterion to define the temperature @xmath7 at which @xmath16 departs from monotonic behaviour and the first derivative @xmath25 shows a maximum ( i.e. a point of inflexion appears ) as shown schematically by the arrow in the figure 1 . </S>",
    "<S> data for a number of yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath26 samples with different @xmath8 s and @xmath27 were collected and the results of the analysis are plotted as a function of @xmath8 in figure 2 . because there are usually not many spectra at different temperatures available , </S>",
    "<S> the data are necessarily plotted with a range of temperatures indicated as error - bars . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the correlation between the temperature @xmath7 where the spectrum departs from monotonic behaviour and @xmath8 is quite evident and the relation appears almost linear in yba@xmath28cu@xmath3o@xmath4 over the whole range of @xmath27 .    to complement the analysis on @xmath29 , </S>",
    "<S> we have systematically collected infrared and raman phonon spectra on yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath30 with different @xmath27 and determined the temperatures @xmath31 at which phonon anomalies appear . to expand the data set </S>",
    "<S> somewhat we have also used the published data on phonon anomalies in the 124 and 247 structures , which have similar optimal @xmath8 as 123@xcite . ir phonons anomalies are observed above @xmath8 for phonons involving @xmath32-axis displacements of y , ba , o1 ( chain ) , o2/o3 , o4 and cu1(chain ) ions@xcite in 123 system and of o1 ( chain ) and o2/o3 ions in 124 system.@xcite . among raman active phonons </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that the 340-@xmath33-like o2/o3 planar buckling phonon shows little or no anomalies above @xmath34 in underdoped region of doping.@xcite on the other hand the related in phase @xmath35 o2/o3 planar phonon at 440 @xmath20 shows a significantly more pronounced anomaly above @xmath8.@xcite in the 124 system@xcite anomalies above @xmath8 in underdoped region are reported also for the 108-@xmath20ba phonon , 256-@xmath20 cu1 phonon and 501-@xmath20 o4 phonon . </S>",
    "<S> there is no clear data on whether such anomalies for ba and o4 phonons exist also in ybco-123 .    </S>",
    "<S> the citerion for determination of the temperatures @xmath31 was a discontinuous change in the phonon frequency and/or linewidth . </S>",
    "<S> a plot of @xmath36 as a function of doping is shown in the insert to figure 2 as a function of @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the larger scatter in the data in this case is partly due to the ambiguity in determining the exact temperature where a phonon anomaly occurs . despite this , </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen , that in virtually all cases phonon anomalies appear below @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> depending on @xmath37 @xmath31 seems to vary such that in the ortho - ii phase of ybco ( 70k @xmath38  93k ) , @xmath36 @xmath39 , while in the ortho - i phase ( 0 @xmath38  70 k ) , @xmath31 @xmath40 for optimal doping there is no sign of any phonon anomalies above @xmath41 so we assume @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , at present there is insufficient data to be able to correlate the behaviour of particular phonons with different values of @xmath36 and there is a clear need for such a study in the future .    for completeness , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath7 data from optical conductivity are plotted as a function of oxygen content in figure 3@xcite together with @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> these data for @xmath7 obtained from @xmath1 are in good agreement with data on @xmath44@xcite and with other data from a variety of experimental techniques on ybco , including arpes , dc transport and nmr , where it is often called a spin gap temperature @xmath45 . in the present case , </S>",
    "<S> the optical conductivity experiments measure only dipole transitions , and @xmath7 therefore signifies the pseudogap opening for charge excitations . </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of a pseudogap for spin excitations will thus necessarily follow at the same temperature . </S>",
    "<S> ( the converse is is not necessarily true ) . </S>",
    "<S> although there appears to be an apparent spread of values of @xmath7 and @xmath45 in the literaure , suggesting the possible existence of _ two _ pseudogaps appearing at different temperatures , when it is taken into account that very different criteria are used to define @xmath46 by different authors , and that different spectroscopic techniques average over momentum in different ways , data on ybco do not appear to support the two gap hypothesis at present . </S>",
    "<S> careful examination of the optical conductivity data for @xmath1 and @xmath47 particularly in comparison with the data on the increase in nmr  @xmath48 relaxation time ( usually expressed as a drop in @xmath49)@xcite , nmr knight shift @xmath50@xcite@xmath51 neutron scattering@xcite and specific heat data@xcite does not yield any systematic difference in @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> however , with significantly improved sample characterization in the underdoped state and a well - defined common criterion for defining @xmath7 the existence of two distinct , closely spaced gaps can not be excluded .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now turn to a discussion of the presented data in the general framework of the inhomogeneous phase models . </S>",
    "<S> commonly , the state below @xmath6 is suggested to consist of carrier - poor and carrier - rich regions . </S>",
    "<S> the optical response is expected to reflect this , the existence of identifyably different spectral features below @xmath7 and a single component above @xmath52 is in clear accordance with these models . below @xmath46 , </S>",
    "<S> the low - frequency spectrum - which is assumed to be due to itinerant charges - is strongly temperature - dependent , has no identifyable spectral signatures and is described well phenomenologically by an extended drude model ( albeit over a small spectral region ) . as a corrollary , the mir would be expected to be due to the excitation of bound localized carriers _ to the itinerant carrier fermionic phase _ in addition to non - adiabatic hopping processes within the insulating phase itself as will be discussed below .    examining the behaviour of the mir feature as a function of @xmath27 in more detail , </S>",
    "<S> we have plotted the residual conductivity at the peak in the mir ( usually in the range 1000 - 1300 @xmath20 ) below @xmath8 as a function of doping in figure 4 . </S>",
    "<S> the data extracted from rotter _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite are of particular relevance because they are from _ untwinned _ single crystals ( also for lower @xmath27 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find an unambiguous increase in @xmath53 with increasing @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> comparing the @xmath54 with @xmath55 shows that the _ in - plane _ conductivity @xmath55 shows very similar systematics as the total conductivity @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio @xmath56 @xmath57 appears to be only weakly dependent on @xmath27 , indicating that the increasing o doping gives rise to increasing conductivity in the chains and planes on an almost equal footing . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the ratio between the total and chain conductivity is @xmath58 to @xmath59 and is surprisingly similar to the anisotropy of the dc conductivity @xmath60@xcite which suggests that o doping results in an increase in conductivity of _ both _ the drude and mirparts equally ( see figure 4 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the spectral shape of the mir is similar ( but not identical ) to the photoinduced polaronic features observed in the insulating phase in ybco , and is virtually indistinguishable from the mir  response of the insulator prba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4@xcite ( including anisotropy ) . </S>",
    "<S> this , together with clearly visible phonon overtones@xcite in the mir  spectrum led many authors in the past to a ( bi)polaronic interpretation of the mir@xcite . in this model , the mir absorption results from non - adiabatic carrier hopping processes where </S>",
    "<S> a different number of phonons is emitted and reabsorbed , the difference in energy being taken up by the ir photon . </S>",
    "<S> however , the measured mir  spectral shape shows significant deviations from the predicted polaronic spectrum@xcite and expansion of this simple polaron hopping model to include a realistic density of phonon states and allowing for phonon dispersion still can not reproduce the highly asymmetric peak in the mir data . </S>",
    "<S> however , when we consider a two - component state , an additional process becomes possible , namely the excitation of carriers from the polaronic bound state to the unbound fermionic state@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the expected mir  spectrum in this case exhibits an asymmetric spectral shape much closer to the experimentally observed one@xmath22 a more sophisticated attempt at describing the mir  lineshape in detail might include both excitations from the localized states to the delocalized band@xcite as well as non - adiabatic@xcite hopping processes between localized states .    </S>",
    "<S> the interpretation of the mir given above is supported by recent resonant electronic raman spectra of ruani and ricci@xcite , where an electronic peak in the region of 0.06 ev ( 500 @xmath20 ) is observed below @xmath61 the authors attribute this peak to excitations between dispersionless polaronic bands near the s - point of the brillouin zone . </S>",
    "<S> further support for the proposed interpretation comes from the observation of a depression in the density of states below @xmath7 in the same region of the brillouin zone in arpes@xcite : to satisfy the sum rule , ( bi)polaron formation ( i.e.pairing ) below @xmath7 must be accompanied by a depletion in the density of states near @xmath62 , causing the appearance of a pseudo - gap in the arpes  spectrum .    </S>",
    "<S> the present analysis is essentially an alternative phenomenological view of the electrodynamic response of the cuprate superconductors to the one - component memory function parametrization more usually discussed in the recent past@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we believe it provides additional physical insight into the normal and superconducting state properties in line with the numerous recent suggestions for the co - existence of two _ structural _ local units in these materials@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of the optical conductivity in yba@xmath2cu@xmath63o@xmath4 as a function of @xmath27 and @xmath64 reveals some seemingly universal features which could be considered as a possible definition of the low - energy charge excitation spectrum for the cuprates :    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 optical conductivity @xmath65 or @xmath18 ( with or without chains respectively ) in ybco universally displays a break from monotonic behaviour near 400 @xmath20 ( 50 mev ) below some temperature @xmath66 the changes in the optical spectrum below @xmath7 suggest a separation of @xmath29 into two separate responses with characteristic excitation energy scales and well - defined and different @xmath67 and @xmath64-dependences , rather than the opening of a simple gap . above @xmath7 </S>",
    "<S> the two excitations appear indistinguishable , presumably as a result of thermal fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .   </S>",
    "<S> below @xmath7 the low - frequency optical conductivity ( @xmath68 @xmath20 ) of the itinerant carriers is apparently described reasonably well by an extended drude model with a frequency- and temperature - dependent scattering rate @xmath69 @xcite . assuming a fermi energy of 0.1 ev and @xmath70 </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the mean free path @xmath71 @xmath72 for the drude carriers at @xmath7 is @xmath73 awhich is remarkably close to the typical length scale of the spatial inhomogeneities ( stripe widths ) found in structural experiments@xcite , suggesting that the properties of the drude carriers are determined by the physics of the fermions in the confined structure . </S>",
    "<S> the increasing @xmath71 at lower temperatures might be a sign of increasing coherence between stripes , rather than increasing stripe width . </S>",
    "<S> 3 .   </S>",
    "<S> the 2-component analysis is consistent both with the observations of a  pseudogap  in transport@xcite , </S>",
    "<S> nmr@xcite and arpes@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an explanation consistent with all four experimental techniques involves the formation of polarons in carrier - poor regions below @xmath46 giving rise to a reduction in the dos at @xmath62 and hence a drop in the @xmath74 for nmr , as well as an apparent shift in the binding energy @xmath75 in arpes . </S>",
    "<S> this polaronic effect is indeed expected to be associated with the flat , dispersionless regions of the fermi surface , consistent with the enhanced polaron effective mass @xmath76 , the electronic raman  data@xcite and arpes@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> 4 .   the in - plane mir conductivity @xmath54 - which is presumed to be principally due to the excitation of localized carriers to the fermionic regions in the cu - o planes - increases in intensity systematically with @xmath27 closely following the density of doped holes and is only weakly temperature dependent . </S>",
    "<S> 5 .   </S>",
    "<S> numerous phonon anomalies appear in the optical conductivity in a range of temperatures such that @xmath31 @xmath77 , suggesting a coupling of the lattice degrees of freedom to the electronic charge excitations . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately there is insufficient data available at present for a more detailed examination of which phonons are involved , but the structural data from exafs@xcite  and pdf@xcite appear to corroborate this observation . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath7 observable for charge excitations appears to be consistent with @xmath45 in nmr and other experimental techniques , and is at this time experimentally indistinguishable from it .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we briefly discuss the possible involvement of ( bi)polarons in superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> their role was usually dismissed as unimportant on the grounds that there is no observable change in @xmath78 at mir frequencies at @xmath8 . in the bcs  scenario , pairing occurs simultaneously with the opening of a gap in the charge excitation spectrum and the appearance of a macroscopic phase coherent state at ( or very near ) @xmath8 . as a result of the gap , </S>",
    "<S> a significant change in spectral weight is observed in @xmath78 below @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , in the be condensation picture , pairing is an independent process from condensation and the establishment of phase coherence . of course it must occur above ( or at ) the condensation temperature because the process of condensation requires a macroscopic number of particles with bose statistics to be present . in the case of underdoped cuprates , where neither the drude nor mir show any change at @xmath8 itself , the implication is that be condensation of pre - formed pairs takes place with no change in pairing amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> it is natural to presume that because the redistribution of spectral weight in the optical spectrum starts to occur at @xmath5 this temperature should be associated with the onset of pair formation . </S>",
    "<S> hence we conclude the paper by pointing out that the suggested two component interpretation of the optical conductivity spectra in underdoped cuprates is consistent with pair formation at @xmath7 and the bose - einstein condensation of such pairs across , or together with itinerant drude carriers into a macroscopically coherent ground state at @xmath8 @xcite . </S>"
