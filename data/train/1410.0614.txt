    "many fundamental nuclear physics issues depend on our quantitative understanding of the @xmath0-decay phenomena in nuclei . due to phase - space amplification effects , the @xmath0-decay rates are sensitive to both nuclear binding energies and @xmath0-strength functions . within an appropriate @xmath0-decay model , the correct amount of the integral @xmath0-strength should be placed within the properly calculated @xmath7- window provided that the spectral distribution is also close to the `` true '' @xmath0-strength function .",
    "it is desirable to have theoretical models which can describe the data wherever they can be measured , and predict the properties related to spin - isospin modes in the nuclei too short - lived to allow for experimental studies .",
    "one of the successful tools for studying charge - exchange nuclear modes is the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) with the self - consistent mean - field derived from a skyrme - type energy - density functional ( edf ) , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "these qrpa calculations enable one to describe the properties of the ground state and excited charge - exchange states using the same edf .",
    "experimental studies using the multipole decomposition analysis of the ( n , p ) and ( p , n ) reactions  @xcite found substantial gamow - teller ( g - t ) strength above the g - t resonance peak and have clarified a longstanding problem of the missing experimental g - t strength , hence resolving the discrepancies between the theoretical rpa predictions and the experimental measurements . it has been found necessary to take into account the coupling with more complex configurations in order to shift some strength to higher energies and to comply with the experimental results @xcite . using the skyrme edf and the rpa ,",
    "such attempts in the past  @xcite have allowed one to understand the damping of charge - exchange resonances and their particle decay .",
    "recently , the damping of the g - t mode has been investigated using the skyrme - rpa plus particle - vibration coupling  @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty is that the complexity of the calculations increases rapidly with the size of the configuration space and one has to work within limited spaces .    making use of the finite rank separable approximation ( frsa ) @xcite for the residual interaction one can perform skyrme - qrpa calculations in very large two - quasiparticle spaces .",
    "following the basic ideas of the quasiparticle - phonon model ( qpm )  @xcite , the approach has been generalized for the coupling between one- and two - phonon components of the wave functions  @xcite .",
    "the so - called frsa was thus used to study the electric low - lying states and giant resonances within and beyond the qrpa  @xcite .",
    "recently , the frsa approach was extended to charge - exchange nuclear excitations  @xcite and also for accommodating the tensor correlations which mimic the skyrme - type tensor interactions  @xcite . in the present work",
    "we generalize the approach to the coupling between one- and two - phonon components in the wave functions . as an application of the method we study the @xmath0-decay half - lives of neutron - rich @xmath3 isotones and ni isotopes and we compare to the most neutron - rich ( @xmath8 ) doubly - magic nucleus @xmath6ni which is also an important waiting point in the r - process  @xcite . in the case of @xmath6ni preliminary results of our calculation without the tensor interaction",

    "the frsa model for charge - exchange excitations was already introduced in refs .  @xcite . in the present study , this method is extended by including the coupling between one- and two - phonon terms in the wave functions of g - t states .",
    "the starting point is the hartree - fock(hf)-bcs calculation  @xcite of the parent ground state within a spherical symmetry assumption . in the particle - hole ( p - h )",
    "channel we use the skyrme interaction with the triplet - even and triplet - odd tensor components introduced in refs .",
    "the continuous part of the single - particle spectrum is discretized by diagonalizing the hf hamiltonian on a harmonic oscillator basis . the inclusion of the tensor interaction results in the following modification of the spin - orbit potential in coordinate space  @xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) are the densities and the spin - orbit densities , respectively",

    "the values of @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are fixed to reproduce the odd - even mass difference of the studied nuclei  @xcite .    to build the qrpa equations on the basis of hf - bcs quasiparticle states with the residual interactions consistently derived from the skyrme edf in the p - h channel and from the zero - range pairing force in the particle - particle ( p - p ) channel",
    "is a standard procedure  @xcite .",
    "the dimensions of the qrpa matrix grow very rapidly with the size of the nuclear system unless severe and damaging cut - offs are made to the 2-quasiparticle configuration space .",
    "it is well known that , if the qrpa matrix elements take a separable form the qrpa energies can be obtained as the roots of a relatively simple secular equation  @xcite . in the case of the skyrme interaction",
    "this feature has been exploited by different authors @xcite .",
    "the main step of the frsa is to simplify the central p - h interaction @xmath25 by approximating it by its landau - migdal form .",
    "all landau parameters with @xmath26 are equal to zero in the case of skyrme interactions .",
    "we keep only the @xmath27 terms in @xmath25 and this approximation is reasonable  @xcite .",
    "the two - body coulomb residual interaction is dropped .",
    "therefore we can write @xmath25 as @xmath28 \\delta ( { \\bf r}_1-{\\bf r } _ 2 ) , \\label{res.int}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the channel index @xmath30 ; @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the spin and isospin operators , @xmath33 with the fermi momentum @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the nucleon effective mass .",
    "the coefficients @xmath36 and @xmath37 are zero , while the expressions for @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , @xmath43 can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite and in ref .",
    "@xcite , respectively . for the case of electric excitations one can neglect the spin - spin terms since they play a minor role .",
    "though it is well known that the p - p interaction in the spin - isospin channel ( @xmath44 pairing ) suppresses the @xmath45-decay half - lives , in the present study we assume @xmath37=0 in order to separate the sole impact of the tensor force . as proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite , we simplify the tensor p - h interaction by replacing it by the two - term separable interaction , where the strength parameters are adjusted to reproduce the centroid energies of the g - t and spin - quadrupole strength distributions calculated with the original tensor p - h interaction .    the p - h matrix elements and the antisymmetrized p - p matrix elements can be written in a separable form in the space of the angular coordinates  @xcite . after integrating over the angular variables the one - dimensional radial integrals",
    "are numerically calculated by choosing a large enough cutoff radius @xmath46 and using an @xmath47-point integration gauss formula with abscissas @xmath48 and weights @xmath49  @xcite .",
    "thus , one is led to deal with a problem where the matrix elements of the residual interaction are sums of products and the number @xmath50 of terms in the sums depends only on @xmath47 . in particular , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are obtained for the cases of g - t and electric excitations , respectively .",
    "one can call it a separable approximation of finite rank @xmath50 since finding the roots of the secular equation amounts to find the zeros of a @xmath53 determinant , and the dimensions of the determinant are independent of the size of the configuration space , i.e. , of the nucleus considered . the studies of refs . @xcite",

    "first , the properties of the low - lying @xmath9 states of the daughter nuclei are studied within the one - phonon approximation . as expected ,",

    "the transition energies @xmath117 refer to the ground state of the parent nucleus .",
    "qrpa results calculated without the tensor interaction indicate that the dominant configuration of the @xmath115_{qrpa}$ ] states is @xmath118 whose contribution is about 91  @xmath119 in all the cases considered . in other words , the @xmath115_{qrpa}$ ] state is not collective and , therefore , the @xmath2-decay is related to the unperturbed @xmath118 energy .",
    "at the same time the calculated @xmath120 value increases from 3.7 for @xmath116ni to 3.9 for @xmath5ni .",

    "moreover , for @xmath105ni , @xmath121ge and @xmath122se , the @xmath115_{qrpa}$ ] state of the daughter nucleus is above the parent ground state , i.e. , this calculation predicts stable @xmath105ni , @xmath121ge and @xmath122se .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the relativistic qrpa approach  @xcite gives a similar structure of the @xmath115_{qrpa}$ ] state for these nuclei .    as a general trend",
    ", we observe a redistribution of the g - t strengths by the inclusion of the tensor interaction in the qrpa , in the same way as it was found in refs .",
    "the tensor correlations shift up about 10% of the g - t strength to the energy region above 30mev .",
    "also , the tensor interaction makes a downward shift of the strength in the g - t resonance region below the peak energy and the @xmath115_{qrpa}$ ] state is moved downwards .",
    "this is illustrated in the cases of @xmath5zn and @xmath116ni ( see left bottom panels of figs .  3 - 4 ) .",
    "for @xmath5ni , the @xmath115_{qrpa}$ ] energy shift reaches 2.7  mev .",
    "in particular , because of this shift , we get unstable @xmath105ni and @xmath121ge . in addition , the tensor correlations lead to a collective structure for the @xmath115_{qrpa}$ ] state with the dominance of the @xmath118 configuration . in the case of the @xmath3 isotones",
    "the @xmath118 contribution increases from 46% in @xmath6ni to 72% in @xmath122se , whereas for ni isotopes this contribution decreases from 57% in @xmath105ni to 39% in @xmath5ni .",
    "the @xmath115_{qrpa}$ ] collectivity is reflected in the @xmath120 value and there is a slight decrease of the @xmath120 from 2.3 for @xmath105ni to 2.0 for @xmath5ni . as can be seen from fig.5 and fig.6 , the half - lives calculated with the tensor force are about 60 - 2000 times shorter than those calculated without . this analysis within the one - phonon approximation can help to identify the tensor correlation effects , but it is only a rough estimate .",
    "it is worth to mention that the first discussion of the strong impact of the tensor correlations on the @xmath2-decay half - lives based on qrpa calculations with skyrme forces has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us now discuss the extension of the space to one- and two - phonon configurations in the frsa model when the tensor interaction is taken into account .",
    "in all ten nuclei , the dominant contribution in the wave function of the first @xmath9 state comes from the @xmath123_{qrpa}$ ] configuration , but the two - phonon contributions are appreciable .",
    "the main two - phonon components of the @xmath124 wave function are the @xmath125_{qrpa}$ ] and @xmath126_{qrpa}$ ] configurations .",
    "when the tensor interaction is not included , the main configuration is only the @xmath125_{qrpa}$ ] configuration . as a result ,",
    "the inclusion of the two - phonon terms results in an increase of the transition energies @xmath127 and the energy shift is large ( 1.1 mev for @xmath121ge and 0.8 mev for @xmath5zn ) in comparison with 0.2 mev in the case of the doubly - magic nucleus @xmath6ni .",
    "the @xmath120 value is practically unchanged .",
    "one can see from figs.5 - 6 that the effects of the phonon - phonon coupling produce a sizable impact on the @xmath0-decay half - life which is reduced by a factor 30 .",
    "specifically , the @xmath125_{qrpa}$ ] configuration is the important ingredient for the half - life description since the @xmath79_{qrpa}$ ] state is the lowest collective - electromagnetic excitation which leads to the minimal two - phonon energy and the maximal matrix elements coupling one- and two - phonon configurations of eqs .",
    "( [ 2pheq1 ] ) and ( [ 2pheq2 ] ) .",
    "5 and 6 also show the half - life reduction as an effect of the quadrupole - phonon coupling . for @xmath122se ,",
    "the experimental half - life is @xmath128  min@xcite , but our model predicts that this nucleus is stable against @xmath0-decay and , in particular , @xmath129=0.0  mev .",
    "one can expect an improvement if the @xmath44 pairing interaction is taken into account .",
    "we intend to extend our formalism to include the @xmath44 pairing effects .",
    "it is interesting to discuss the change of the half - lives along the chains of the @xmath3 isotones and the ni isotopes . as pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , there are different evolutions of the existing experimental half - lives , namely , the 37.3-time reduction of half - life values from @xmath121ge to @xmath6ni and the gradual reduction of half - lives with increasing neutron number for the ni isotopes .",
    "one can see that our results reproduce this behaviour which is sensitive to the isotopic and isotonic dependences of the transition energies @xmath127 .",
    "we find that the energy @xmath127 for @xmath121ge ( @xmath130ni ) is 3.1 ( 1.2 ) times less than that in @xmath6ni .",
    "it is worth to mention that the calculated half - life of @xmath121ge is in reasonable agreement with the experimental data . as can be seen from fig .",
    "6 , the main discrepancies between measured and calculated half - lives of ni isotopes are due to too strong tensor correlations and one should seek for improvements in the tensor part of the effective interaction used .",
    "finally , for neighbours of @xmath6ni we give predictions as the bottom limit of the half - life ( 0.7 ms for @xmath4fe and 2.5 ms for @xmath5ni ) .",
    "it is seen that the phonon - phonon coupling plays a minor role .",
    "our calculated half - life of @xmath5ni is in qualitative agreement with the recently observed value of @xmath131ms  @xcite .",
    "the sgii parametrization of the central force gives a reasonable description of properties of the g - t and charge - exchange spin - dipole resonances of @xmath83zr  @xcite and the low - energy spectrum of the quadrupole excitations for nuclei near @xmath83zr  @xcite .",
    "for the half - life description , the quantitative agreement with the experimental data is not satisfactory for the neutron - rich nuclei",
    ". a possible reason might be the underestimated symmetry energy of 26.8  mev in the case of the sgii set .",
    "a half - life study of the influence of the two - phonon terms with taking into account the tensor interaction for the different parametrizations of central skyrme force is still underway .",
    "inclusion of the tensor interaction results in significant increase of the transition energies and partial rates of the main g - t transitions . including the @xmath1 configurations leads to further increase of its rate and to the appearance of the weak fragmented satellites at low transition energy ( see , e.g. , right bottom panels of figs.3 - 4 ) .",
    "importantly , such a change of the g - t strength distribution takes place in the near - threshold region .",
    "thus , an additional constraint on the @xmath0-strength distribution is also given by delayed neutron emission probability ( @xmath132-value )  @xcite .",
    "since the frsa model enables one to evaluate the coupling of qrpa phonons to more complex configurations , such calculations that take into account the @xmath1 fragmentation of the qrpa excitations are now in progress .",
    "starting from a skyrme effective interaction the g - t strength in the @xmath7- window has been studied within the extended frsa model including both the tensor interaction and @xmath1 configurations effects .",
    "the suggested approach enables one to perform the calculations in very large configuration spaces . using the parameter set sgii+tensor interaction ,",
    "we have applied this model to the g - t states in the neutron - rich ni isotopes and @xmath3 isotones , for which experimental data of @xmath45-decay rates are available .",
    "the inclusion of the tensor interaction leads to a redistribution of the g - t strength .",
    "the low - energy g - t strength is fragmented and the @xmath124 state is moved downwards .",
    "we observe that the coupling between one- and two - phonon terms with the @xmath10 phonon states is strong in these nuclei , and the @xmath1 fragmentation and damping of the qrpa excitations are thus important .",
    "in particular , the energy shift of the lowest @xmath9 state due to the phonon - phonon coupling is large : 0.8 mev in @xmath5zn and 1.1 mev in @xmath121ge in comparison with 0.2 mev in the case of @xmath6ni . taking into account these effects results in a dramatic reduction of @xmath0-decay half - lives .",
    "it is shown that the @xmath1 impact on the half - lives comes inherently from the @xmath125_{qrpa}$ ] term of the wave function of the @xmath124 state . at a qualitative level ,",
    "our results reproduce the experimental evolution of the half - lives , i.e. , for the @xmath3 isotones we describe the sharp reduction of half - lives with decreasing proton number and at the same time , for the ni isotopes , the gradual reduction of half - lives with increasing neutron number .",
    "we give predictions for open - shell nuclei @xmath4fe and @xmath5ni near @xmath6ni that are important for stellar nucleosynthesis . using the strong tensor correlations  @xcite our estimation is rather the bottom limit of these half - lives .",
    "also , our calculations show that the influence of the phonon coupling is small on the half - lives of @xmath4fe and @xmath5ni .",
    "more information on the @xmath0-strength distributions can be derived from simultaneous analysis of the half - lives and the @xmath132 values  @xcite .",

    "<S> the effects of the phonon - phonon coupling on the @xmath0-decay rates of neutron - rich nuclei are studied in a microscopic model based on skyrme - type interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the approach uses a finite - rank separable approximation ( frsa ) of the skyrme - type particle - hole ( p - h ) residual interaction . </S>",
    "<S> very large two - quasiparticle spaces can thus be treated . </S>",
    "<S> a redistribution of the gamow - teller ( g - t ) strength is found due to the tensor correlations and the @xmath1 fragmentation of g - t states . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2-decay half - lives are decreased significantly . using the skyrme interaction sgii together with a volume - type pairing interaction we illustrate this reduction effect by comparing with available experimental data for the ni isotopes and neutron - rich @xmath3 isotones . </S>",
