    "study of non - gaussian features in primordial perturbations generated during inflation has become a subject of great importance as the precise determination of these primordial non - gaussianities can quantify the dynamics of the early universe @xcite . in generic single - field slow - roll inflationary scenario the preferred initial vacuum chosen for the inflaton perturbations is the bunch - davies vacuum .",
    "it is shown in @xcite , that if inflation is preceded by a radiation era then the inflaton fluctuations will have an initial thermal distribution where the initial vacuum will depart from the standard bunch - davies one",
    ". the presence of pre - inflationary radiation era enhances the power spectrum of scalar modes by an extra temperature depended factor @xmath2 .",
    "the enhanced power spectrum is in accordance with the observations if the comoving temperature @xmath3 of the primordial perturbations is less than @xmath4 mpc@xmath5 @xcite . in this talk",
    "we will show that presence of pre - inflationary radiation era not only enhances the power spectrum but also generates large bispectrum and trispectrum and these non - gaussianities will carry signatures of such pre - inflationary radiation era @xcite which will be discussed in detail .",
    "the derivations shown in this talk are done in _ spatially flat gauge_. this gauge is preferred in the derivations as in this gauge the comoving curvature perturbation @xmath6 is proportional to the inflaton fluctuations @xmath7 as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the hubble parameter and the overdot represents derivative w.r.t .",
    "cosmic time @xmath10 .",
    "thus , in this gauge , the comoving curvature power spectrum , i.e. the two - point correlation function of @xmath11 in fourier space , is directly related to inflaton s power spectrum as @xmath12 the comoving curvature power spectrum is measured through observations of the @xmath13 anisotropy spectrum of cmbr which is nearly scale - invariant .",
    "bispectrum , the non - vanishing three - point correlation function of primordial fluctuations , is the lowest order departure from gaussianity of those primordial perturbations .",
    "the non - gaussianity arising from bispectrum is quantified by a non - linear parameter , @xmath1 , which is constrained by several experiments as : ( i ) the wmap 5yr data yields @xmath14 ( @xmath15 cl ) @xcite , ( ii ) the planck mission is sensitive to probe bispectrum upto @xmath16 @xcite and ( iii ) in future experiments if the primordial non - gaussianities imprinted in 21 cm background is measured then @xmath17 can be probed @xcite . in a free theory , as the primordial perturbations are gaussian in nature , the three - point correlation function vanishes yielding no non - gaussianity .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that self - interactions of inflaton field of the kind @xmath18 generates non - vanishing bispectrum proportional to @xmath19 but the non - gaussianity is too small @xmath20 to be probed by any existing or future experiments .",
    "on the other hand , in a generic single - field slow - roll inflationary model non - linearities in the evolution of primordial perturbations @xmath11 can also generate primordial non - gaussianities in cmbr . in the non - linear limit one can write @xmath21 which yields a non - vanishing three - point correlation function of @xmath22 in terms of four - point correlation function of inflaton perturbations @xmath23 as @xmath24 even when the initial perturbations @xmath23 are gaussian in nature .",
    "the four - point correlation function on the r.h.s . can be written in terms of product of two two - point correlation functions and defining @xmath1 as @xmath25 one can show that the non - linear parameter is of the order of slow - roll parameters @xmath26 @xcite , which is also too small @xmath27 to be detected by any present or forthcoming experiments .",
    "the delta - function in the above equation ensures that the three momenta form a triangle and @xmath1 is determined in several such triangle configurations , some of them which we will consider in this talk are : ( i ) _ squeezed configuration _",
    "@xmath28 , ( ii ) _ equilateral configuration _ @xmath29 and ( iii ) _ folded configuration _",
    "@xmath30 .",
    "the connected part of four - point correlation function of primordial fluctuations is called the trispectrum @xmath31 the non - linear parameter @xmath0 quantifies the non - gaussianity arising from trispectrum and it is constrained by observations as ( i ) wmap constraints trispectrum as @xmath32 @xcite , ( ii ) planck is expected to reach the sensitivity upto @xmath33 @xcite and ( iii ) future 21 cm experiments can probe trispectrum up to the level @xmath34 @xcite . a free - scalar theory yields vanishing trispectrum like vanishing bispectrum",
    ". but non - linear evolution of @xmath35 as given in eq .",
    "( [ non - linear ] ) yields a trispectrum where @xmath36 @xcite , which being proportional to the square of slow - roll parameters is too small to be detected by any present or future experiments .",
    "it is to be noted that the generic single - field slow - roll inflation predicts a trispectrum which smaller than the bispectrum by orders of magnitude .",
    "if inflation is preceded by a radiation era then the inflaton field will have an initial thermal distribution where the thermal vacuum @xmath37 will have finite occupation as @xmath38 ( the number operator @xmath39 ) .",
    "also there will be a probability of the system to be in an energy state @xmath40 as @xmath41 due to this probability distribution the correlation functions have to be thermal averaged .",
    "taking into account the initial thermal distributions of the primordial fluctuations and the probability distribution due to pre - inflationary radiation era the thermal averaged inflaton s power spectrum will have an enhancement factor @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the distribution function of primordial perturbations .",
    "for inflaton ( scalar ) perturbations the distribution function will be bose - einstein distribution function @xmath44 and thus the enhancement factor will be @xmath45 where @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "this enhanced power spectrum is in accordance with the observations when @xmath47 mpc@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "as the two - point correlation function is thermal averaged due to the effects of pre - inflationary radiation era , the other higher - point correlation functions have also to be thermal averaged in a similar way . for three - point correlation function this will be @xmath48 but now the probability of occupancy of a state with four energies @xmath49 will be @xmath50 due to thermal averaging @xmath1 is enhanced .",
    "we compute the non - gaussianity in this scenario arising from bispectrum in different triangle configurations : ( i ) _ squeezed configuration _ : in this configuration the enhanced non - gaussianity is @xmath51 where @xmath1 is enhanced by a factor of 64.82 , ( ii ) _ equilateral configuration _ : in this configuration the enhanced non - gaussianity is @xmath52 where @xmath1 is enhanced by a factor of 90.85 , ( iii ) _ folded configuration _ : in this configuration the enhanced non - gaussianity is @xmath53 where @xmath1 is enhanced by a factor of 73.28 .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath1 , which is enhanced due to effects of pre - inflationary radiation era , is within the sensitivity of future 21-cm experiments where primordial non - gaussianities can be detected @xcite .",
    "it is also to be noted that the maximum non - gaussianity can arise in the equilateral configuration when inflation is preceded by a radiation era . in a later work",
    "@xcite similar analysis is done when perturbations are already present in the initial vacuum .",
    "it is found in @xcite too that initial presence of quanta in the vacuum can significantly enhance non - gaussianity arising from bispectrum which is in agreement with the results presented here and in @xcite .",
    "it is very interesting to note at this point that due to thermal averaging the four - point correlation function is not equal to the product of two two - point correlation functions which can yield a non - vanishing connected part as @xmath54 thus defining the trispectrum in such a situation as @xmath55,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we see that , as the linear perturbations can generate non - vanishing connected part due to thermal averaging , the non - linear parameter @xmath56 will not depend up on slow - roll parameters and can be as large as 42.58 @xcite which is within the detection range of future 21-cm background anisotropy experiments @xcite .",
    "hence , we see that the presence of pre - inflationary radiation era yields larger trispectrum non - gaussianity than bispectrum .",
    "the talk was focused on non - gaussian features in a single - field slow - roll inflationary model where inflation is preceded by a radiation era . in a generic single - field slow - roll model of super - cool inflation non - linear evolution of primordial fluctuations",
    "generate bispectrum non - gaussianity which is proportional to the slow - roll parameters @xcite and thus too small to be detected by any present or future experiments .",
    "non - linear evolution of primordial fluctuations also generates trispectrum non - gaussianity where @xmath0 is proportional to the square of slow - roll parameters @xcite .",
    "thus , this generic inflationary scenario predicts trispectrum non - gaussianity which is much smaller than the bispectrum non - gaussianity .",
    "we showed that if such a generic inflationary scenario is preceded by a radiation era it can yield large bispectrum and trispectrum non - gaussianities @xcite which are within the range of detection of future 21-cm background anisotropy experiments @xcite .",
    "due to presence of pre - inflationary radiation era the initial vacuum will contain thermal fluctuations and also the energy states will have a probability distribution .",
    "accordingly , the thermal averaged three - point correlation function generates large non - gaussianity where the enhancement of @xmath1 over the generic scenario is largest in the equilateral configuration .",
    "an interesting situation arises in the case of trispectrum as the thermal averaged four - point correlation function is not equal to the product of two thermal - averaged two - point correlation functions .",
    "thus the linear primordial perturbations can generate a non - vanishing connected part of four - point correlation function due to thermal averaging and @xmath0 in such a case will not depend up on the slow - roll parameters .",
    "we compute that in such a scenario @xmath56 can be as large as 43 @xcite .",
    "thus a significant signature of such pre - inflationary radiation era is that it yields larger trispectrum than bispectrum .",
    "this signature can distinguish between an inflationary scenario preceded by a radiation era and the generic scenario of single - field slow - roll super - cool inflation .",
