    "several supernova remnants ( snrs ) are known as sites of acceleration of cosmic - ray particles with the energy of up to tev . the first observational evidence is discovered by @xcite in the x - ray band .",
    "they found x - rays from shell regions of sn 1006 with asca , and revealed that the x - rays are produced via synchrotron radiation by tev electrons .",
    "we have not yet succeeded observationally in determining the maximum energy and acceleration efficiency of protons and even electrons , which are the key to understand the acceleration site of galactic cosmic rays . in the context of diffusive shock acceleration ,",
    "particles with a higher energy require a longer acceleration time , while they have a shorter cooling and escape time ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these timescales are functions of a diffusion coefficient of accelerated particles around the shock ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "curvature in x - ray synchrotron spectrum depends on the energy spectrum of highest - energy electrons there . measuring the spectral shape ( i.e. , slope or photon index , rolloff frequency and spectral curvature ) expected to be observed in the x - ray synchrotron emission is crucial to understand the environment and mechanism of cosmic ray acceleration ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "so far wide - band x - ray spectra have been extensively studied in several snrs ; e.g. , rx j1713.7@xmath03946 ( @xcite , @xcite ) , sn 1006 @xcite , cassiopeia a @xcite , and g1.9@xmath20.3 @xcite .",
    "rolloff frequencies are reported from a number of snrs .",
    "@xcite reported the rolloff energies distributing @xmath3 kev , from cas  a , kepler snr , tycho snr and rcw  86 . utilizing hard x - ray spectra obtained with nustar ,",
    "the rolloff energies of @xmath4  kev and @xmath5 kev were observed from tycho snr @xcite and g  1.9@xmath20.3 @xcite , respectively .",
    "tev gamma - rays have been also observed from a number of snrs , which are thought to be produced via inverse compton scattering of tev electrons or via @xmath6 decay process of high - energy protons ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the young snr vela jr .",
    "( rx j0852@xmath04622 ) was discovered by rosat in 1998 @xcite .",
    "it is one of tev - emitting snrs , and has a diameter of 2@xmath7 .",
    "it overlaps with the south - east portion of much larger and known vela snr , and is situated near the pulsar and pulsar wind nebulae ( pwn ) of vela snr .",
    "vela jr .  has a synchrotron x - ray shell ( @xcite , @xcite ) , which is observed also in radio @xcite and gamma - rays @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported a spatial correlation between the radio emission from molecular clouds around vela jr .  and",
    "tev gamma - rays .",
    "magnetic field strength at the shock surface of vela jr",
    ".  has been estimated by some authors . while @xcite estimated the field strength , @xmath8 g from the thickness of x - ray thin shell taken by chandra , @xcite derived @xmath9@xmath10 g , by comparing brightness distribution profile at the shell in 210 kev with expected radial profile by @xcite .",
    "@xcite constructed 1d spherically symmetric model of non - linear diffusive shock acceleration , and obtained @xmath11 g from observation results , assuming synchron x - rays and cosmic microwave background photon upscattered to tev gamma - rays .",
    "the observed spectral slope is so steep that we naturally expect that the synchrotron rolloff energy is below 1 kev , and the spectrum becomes much softer for higher energy bands .",
    "however , the synchrotron emission above 10 kev has not been observed for vela jr . , and thus the spectral shape has not yet been determined . in order to determine the photon index and to examine the expected rolloff structure ,",
    "wideband x - ray observation covering above 10 kev is important .",
    "x - ray astronomy satellite suzaku @xcite covers the energy range of 0.2600 kev with four units of the x - ray imaging spectrometers ( xiss : @xcite ) and the hard x - ray detector ( hxd : @xcite ) .",
    "since both instruments have very low - background capabilities ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , which enable us to perform high sensitivity surveys of x - rays , the suzaku is most suitable for diffuse objects .",
    "we report the first result of spectral analysis of wideband observation of vela jr .  with suzaku .",
    "we describe suzaku observations and data reduction of vela jr .  in section 2 ,",
    "summarize results of analysis in section 3 , and present a discussion in section 4 .",
    "we preformed 40 mapping observations of vela jr .  and its close vicinity in 2005 december , 2007 july , and 2008 july .",
    "table [ tab : obsno ] shows the observation details .",
    "hereafter , we refer to each observation position in an abbreviated style by clipping each object name . for example , we call vela jr p1 as p1 , and rxj_0852@xmath04622_nw as nw",
    ".    one of the two types of instruments of suzaku is a set of the xiss , each of which is installed on the focal plane of an individual set of the x - ray telescopes ( xrts : serlemitsos et al .",
    "the xis covers a field of view ( fov ) of @xmath12 with the angular resolution of @xmath13 in half power diameter in the energy range of 0.212 kev .",
    "the xis 0 , 2 , and 3 are front side illuminated ( fi ) ccds , whereas xis 1 is a back - side illuminated ( bi ) ccd .",
    "fi ccds are more sensitive in the energy band above 5 kev because the depletion layers are thicker than that of a bi ccd .",
    "we use only xis 0 , 1 , and 3 data because xis 2 has not been operated since 2007 .",
    "spaced - row charge injections ( @xcite , @xcite ) were carried out in all the observations except nw and nw_offset .",
    "we use the software package heasoft 6.12 with caldb 2009 - 08 - 04 for the analysis and xspec v12.7.1 for the spectral analysis .",
    "each observation data is reprocessed by aepipeline 1.0.1 .",
    "we extract events based on the following criteria : elevation angle from night earth @xmath14 , elevation angle from day earth @xmath15 .",
    "we remove calibration source regions at the corner of the fov .",
    "the hxd is a well - type phoswitch counter , whose main detection - part consists of silicon detectors and gso crystal scintillators .",
    "the silicon pin type semiconductor detector covers hard x - ray band of 1070 kev , and has fov of @xmath16 .",
    "the gso crystal scintillators cover the band of 40600 kev .",
    "we do not present the result of gso because no significant detection is made .",
    "since the well - type active shield provides low - background environment for the pin detector , it is one of the ideal detectors to observe low surface - brightness objects like snrs .",
    "we extract events which have an elevation angle of @xmath14 and geomagnetic cut - off rigidity of @xmath17 gv .",

    "in section [ sec : ana ] , we have shown the results of spectral analysis of vela jr .  with suzaku .",
    "x - rays with the energy up to 22 kev are detected from the north - west region of vela jr .",
    "the spectra in the soft and hard x - ray band are reproduced with a power - law model with the photon indices of @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively . when the spectra in both the bands are fitted simultaneously , a single power - law model with the photon index of @xmath20 , or a slightly concave - shaped broken power - law model , is accepted .",
    "the obtained wide band steep power - law like spectrum with photon index @xmath21 implies the energy index @xmath22 of synchrotron electron with the energy distribution of @xmath23 .",
    "this steep spectrum strongly suggests that the rolloff energy is well below the xis band .",
    "@xcite reported the radio spectral index of @xmath24 at nw region , and @xcite reported the flux density at 1 ghz of @xmath25 50 jy from entire region of the snr . in order to verify consistency between the x - ray and radio results , the x - ray spectra with xis and pin",
    "are tested with srcut model in xspec @xcite .",
    "the srcut model describes the synchrotron spectrum from electrons with an exponentially - rolloff power - law distribution in energy .",
    "the synchrotron spectrum has a power - law form from radio band to x - ray band with a rolloff energy .",
    "the srcut model has three parameters ; x - ray rolloff energy , spectral index at 1 ghz , and flux at 1 ghz .",
    "we fit the x - ray spectra using spectral index @xmath26 in radio band reported by @xcite and typical value of young snrs , i.e. , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "then , when @xmath27 , the best fit parameters of 1 ghz flux density and rolloff energy of @xmath29 jy and @xmath29 kev with @xmath30/d.o.f .",
    "of 1.18 . when @xmath28 , these are @xmath31 jy and @xmath32 kev with @xmath30/d.o.f .",
    "the area of nw region in this paper is @xmath25 27 % of entire vela jr .",
    ", hence the 1 ghz flux is expected to become smaller than values reported by @xcite which is derived from emission of entire vela jr . actually the derived radio flux is smaller than the value of entire vela jr",
    ".  reported by @xcite .",
    "in addition , rolloff energy is below the xis band , which is consistent with our x - ray analysis",
    ". therefore results of our x - ray analysis and in radio band are consistent each other .",
    "since the radio flux at nw region alone has not been reported , additional radio observation is needed to verify this result on wideband spectrum of the nw region .",
    "thus the steep x - ray spectrum naturally requires concave rolloff structure as far as we assume simple acceleration / synchrotron cooling mechanism .",
    "for example , @xcite proposed a simple diagnostic to find possible acceleration mechanisms from the observed spectral shape near the maximum energy , assuming ( a ) one - zone , ( b ) electron energy spectrum of an exponential cutoff power - law ( @xmath33 $ ] ) expressed as equation 1 in @xcite , and ( c ) synchrotron radiation .",
    "figure 5 in @xcite shows the relation between the electron spectral parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 on the relation of soft and hard x - ray spectral indices .    in order to discuss theoretical models , we tried a fitting with a broken power - law model ( iv ) with the fixed breaking energy to 10 kev .",
    "table [ tab : widebestfitpara ] shows the best - fit parameters of this model , and lower right panel of figure [ fig : widespec ] is the spectrum overlaid with the best - fit model spectra .",
    "both the derived photon indices are consistent with that obtained with the model ( iii ) , though that in the hard band is marginally smaller by 0.1 than the latter .",
    "the best - fit flux is close to that obtained in the models ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "figure [ fig : yama2014bekibeki ] overlays our results of the photon indices of below and above 10 kev in the  model ( iv ) in red on figure 5 in @xcite .",
    "we find that our data do not fit any of the theoretical - model lines by @xcite .",
    "thus we find vela jr .",
    "is the second outlier of the theoretical lines following cassiopeia a , despite the spectrum in higher energy than rolloff .",
    "they are unlike the other snr rx j1713.7@xmath03946 whose spectral shape is well described with power - law @xmath2 exponential cutoff model , exhibits the soft and hard photon indices on one of the theoretical lines .",
    "a possible cause for the mismatch is that at least one of the assumptions ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) is incorrect for this object .",
    "a normal one - zone synchrotron x - ray spectrum usually has a photon index of @xmath36 in a softer energy band and rolls off toward the harder energy band due to cooling or escape .",
    "however the wide - band x - ray spectrum of vela jr .",
    "is well reproduced with a single power - law or even a concave - shape broken power - law .",
    "it may suggest that combination of more than one emission component and/or complex emission mechanisms creates the observed x - ray spectra ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , in order to validate the cross - normalization between the xis and the pin , we fit the spectra , allowing both the xis and pin normalizations to vary independently , and find that the best - fit photon index and the xis flux are consistent with the above - discussed case within the error range , whereas the derived cross - normalization factor is @xmath37 , which is marginally larger than that reported for the point source .",
    "this result may imply that brightness distribution in hard x - rays is more compact than that of the xis image and that we have actually underestimated the pin effective area , as we have assumed a larger diffuse - emission region than the real one . considering the case of more compact hard x - ray brightness distribution than that of soft x - rays",
    ", we also showed a conservative fitting result with freed cross - normalization factor in figure [ fig : yama2014bekibeki ] with blue mark and error bars .",
    "the best - fit photon indices are @xmath38 and @xmath39 in the soft and hard energy range , respectively .",
    "although this estimation accepts most of the model lines presented in @xcite , it requires more than one emission region or complex emission mechanisms .",
    "lastly , we show flux comparison with tev emission . in section",
    "[ sec : xisspec ] , we derived the flux of @xmath40 in 210 kev band while @xcite showed the tev flux of entire vela jr .",
    "of @xmath41 with h.e.s.s . both band spectra exhibit similar slope and the x - ray",
    "to tev gamma - ray flux ratio is @xmath25 2.91 .",
    "if we assume the cosmic microwave background inverse compton scattering as tev emission mechanism , we estimate the magnetic field @xmath42 g , which is consistent value derived by @xcite and @xcite . if the tev emission is hadronic , the field strength is not constrained and it may be much higher @xcite .    , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , respectively ( see @xcite ) . the black squares and triangles show the result of rx j1713.7@xmath03946 and of cassiopeia a , respectively .",
    "the red and blue circles show this result with model ( iv ) with cross - normalization fixed to 1.13 or freed , respectively .",
    "these error bars show 99% confidence level .",
