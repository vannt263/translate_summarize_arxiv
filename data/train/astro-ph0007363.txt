    "the observed local stellar velocity distribution in the @xmath0 plane , where @xmath1 is the radial velocity positive towards the anti - centre and @xmath2 the azimuthal velocity positive towards galactic rotation , betrays a large stream of old disc stars with an asymmetric drift @xmath3  kms@xmath4 and @xmath5 ( e.g. dehnen 1998 ) , which hereafter will be referred to as the `` herculis '' stream according to a co - moving eggen group .",
    "one of the most reasonable interpretation of this stream relies on the influence of the galactic bar , which is believed to have a corotation radius @xmath6  kpc and a major - axis presently leading by @xmath7 the sun s azimuth .",
    "raboud et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have shown that @xmath8-body models of the milky  way do produce a mean outward motion of disc particles at realistic positions for the sun relative to the bar and suggest that the herculis stream involves stars on hot orbits , i.e. orbits with a high enough value of jacobi s integral to cross the corotation radius , whereas dehnen  ( 2000 , hereafter d2000 ) relates this velocity mode and the main low - asymmetric drift mode of the observed @xmath0 distribution to the coexistence near the outer lindblad resonance ( olr ) of the inner anti - bar and outer bar elongated periodic orbits replacing the circular orbit close to the olr in a rotating barred potential ( i.e. the same idea introduced by kalnajs  1991 to explain the hyades and sirius streams ) , and attributes the valley at @xmath9  kms@xmath4 between the two modes ( respectively `` olr '' and `` lsr '' mode in his terminology ) to stars on unstable olr orbits",
    ". this paper analyses the role of bar induced chaotic orbits in this context and confronts both alternatives using a similar 2d modelling technique as in dehnen s work .",
    "the details are presented in fux ( 2000 ) .",
    "the working potential is the same as in d2000 , consisting of the sum of an axisymmetric logarithmic potential with constant circular velocity @xmath10 and of a rotating quadrupole term with a bar strength @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is defined as the maximum azimuthal force on the circle passing through the ends of the bar normalised by the axisymmetric radial force at same radius ( @xmath13 in dehnen s notation ) .",
    "the position in space will be parametrised by the galactocentric distance relative to the olr radius @xmath14 and the angle @xmath15 relative to the major axis of bar .",
    "a distance of @xmath16 implies @xmath17  kpc if @xmath18  kpc .",
    "figure  1 ( left ) shows the characteristic curves in the hamiltonian@xmath19 plane ( at @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) of the main periodic orbits existing near the olr and closing after one rotation in the rotating frame , using the labelling of contopoulos & grosbol ( 1989 ) .",
    "the curves essentially resemble those of the circular orbit and of the resonant orbits in the axisymmetric limit , except near the resonances of the circular orbit where bifurcations may transform into gaps , as is the case at the olr ( e.g. sellwood & wilkinson 1993 ) .",
    "figure  1 also displays some members of the @xmath22 and @xmath23 families .",
    "the thick orbits are examples of the perpendicularly oriented orbits that replace the circular orbit near the olr and which are responsible for the bimodality in the observed @xmath0 distribution according to d2000 . in both families ,",
    "the orbits develop loops at high eccentricity , i.e. on the part of the characteristic curves emerging leftwards from the zero velocity curve and where @xmath24 , and the @xmath22 orbits are stable over a remarkable eccentricity range .",
    "figure 2 shows the location in the @xmath0 plane of the @xmath25 , @xmath26 ( olr ) and @xmath27 resonances in the axisymmetric part of the potential for different space positions , and of the periodic orbits passing through these positions in the total axisymmetric+bar potential . at @xmath28",
    "most resonant periodic orbits are stable , except for instance the @xmath29 orbit at @xmath30 , whereas at @xmath31 , most of them are unstable .",
    "in a rotating barred potential , the value of the hamiltonian @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the effective potential , is the only classical integral of motion , known as jacobi s integral .",
    "two critical values of this integral are related to the lagrangian points @xmath34 and @xmath35 , i.e. respectively the saddle points and maxima of @xmath33 . if @xmath36 , an orbit is susceptible to cross the corotation radius , defining the _ hot orbit _",
    "category , and if @xmath37 , an orbit is no longer spatially confined by this integral .",
    "if @xmath1 and @xmath2 are measured relative to the galactic centre , the contours of constant @xmath38 in the @xmath0 plane are circles centred on @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the pattern speed of the bar , and of radius @xmath41 .",
    "figure  2 gives the @xmath42 and @xmath43 contours as a function of space position for the working potential .",
    "the hot orbits are those outside ( low @xmath2 ) the former contour . at @xmath44 and @xmath45 ,",
    "the @xmath42 contour crosses the @xmath2-axis at @xmath46kms@xmath4 for @xmath47  kms@xmath4 , placing the herculis stream in the hot orbit zone .",
    "the next step after the periodic and hot orbits is to determine the extension in phase - space of the regular orbits trapped around the stable periodic orbits and of the chaotic regions .",
    "a convenient tool for this purpose are the liapunov exponents , which describe the mean exponential rate of divergence of two trajectories with infinitesimally different initial conditions .",
    "the largest such exponent , @xmath48 , determines the degree of stochasticity of the orbits and vanishes for regular orbits .",
    "figure 2 gives the divergence timescale @xmath49 of the orbits as a function of planar velocity and space position .",
    "the liapunov divergence timescale can be as low as a few orbital times  for chaotic orbits .",
    "as expected , the stable periodic orbits always lie within regular regions and the unstable orbits within chaotic regions .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath42 contour appears as the average transition from regular motion at low @xmath38 to chaotic motion at high @xmath38 , and thus most hot orbits are chaotic .",
    "due to the four - fold symmetry of the potential , the diagrams at @xmath31 and @xmath28 are symmetric with respect to @xmath50 , and more generally , diagrams at supplementary angles are anti - symmetric to each other in @xmath1 . at @xmath28 ,",
    "the @xmath26 and @xmath27 resonance curves are mainly embedded within broad arcs of regular orbits spaced by chaotic regions at large @xmath38 , while at @xmath31 , these regular arcs occur between the resonance curves . at intermediate angles ,",
    "the regular and chaotic regions become offset from the resonance curves and the @xmath1-symmetry brakes .",
    "in particular , for @xmath51 and for the displayed radial range , a prominent region of regular orbits trapped around stable eccentric @xmath22 orbits extends down to negative  @xmath1 , bounded roughly by the olr curve on the right and penetrating well inside the hot orbit zone , whereas the positive @xmath1 part of the olr curve is surrounded by a wide chaotic region extending somewhat inside the @xmath42 contour and coinciding very well with the observed @xmath0 location of the herculis stream .",
    "note that since 2d axisymmetric potentials are always integrable , all chaotic regions reported here owe uniquely to the bar .",
    "a detailed investigation reveals that the regular orbits associated with the stable low eccentricity periodic orbits of the @xmath23 family exist for @xmath52 and over an angle range around @xmath28 increasing as @xmath53 decreases .",
    "elsewhere , unstable @xmath29 orbits have completely substituted to the regular @xmath23 islands . in particular , there is no @xmath23 streaming motion expected at @xmath16 and @xmath45 in the present working potential .",
    "finally , we want to know how nature populates the available orbits .",
    "this is done by test particle simulations starting with exactly the same initial axisymmetric distribution functions @xmath54 and growing the bar the same way ( i.e. over @xmath55 bar rotations ) as in dehnen s default simulations .",
    "however , we do not apply the claimed high - resolution and noise - free backward integration technique based on the conservation of the phase - space density along orbits .",
    "the reason is because much longer integration times than the few bar rotations adopted in d2000 are necessary to get phase - mixed and quasi - steady evolved distribution functions , and that for integration times larger than about @xmath56 bar rotations , the fine - grained @xmath0 distributions resulting from this technique become highly fluctuating on small scales and even noisy in the chaotic regions and thus must be smoothed to yield the physical coarse - grained distributions .",
    "therefore , we decided to use the standard forward integration technique , sampling @xmath54 with @xmath57 particles , and to average the velocity distributions , derived within finite volumes of radius @xmath58 , over @xmath56 bar rotations to improve the statistics and also to minimise the phase - mixing problem .",
    "the results are depicted in figure  3 . here",
    "the distance parameters in @xmath54 always scale as @xmath53 and the truly changing parameters are those of the bar",
    ". hence frames at different @xmath59 come from distinct simulations .",
    "the @xmath0 distributions seem to present the same symmetry properties in  @xmath1 as described in the previous section for the liapunov divergence timescale .",
    "this is obviously not the case in d2000 , as a consequence of the too short integration .",
    "the high angular momentum peak of the velocity distributions also coincides better with the trace of the non - resonant @xmath22 orbits at @xmath50 .",
    "the regular low eccentricity @xmath23 regions also produce a peak in the velocity distributions , which always lies inside the @xmath42 contour .    in the hot orbit zone , the chaotic regions appear to be more heavily crowded than the regular regions .",
    "this is because the phase - space density in regular regions remains roughly constant during the simulations , whereas there is a net migration of particles on hot chaotic orbits from the inner to the outer space regions , and because the chaotic and regular regions are decoupled from each other , i.e. chaotic orbits can not visit the regions occupied by regular orbits and vice versa .",
    "hence at large @xmath38 , the velocity distributions are dominated by chaotic orbits which are forced to avoid less populated regular regions . in  the parameter range considered here , these forbidden regions are essentially the broad regular orbit regions around the stable eccentric @xmath22 orbits . in  particular , at @xmath16 and @xmath45 , this @xmath22 region lies at @xmath60 , as mentioned above , and thus the main overdensity of hot chaotic orbits occurs at positive @xmath1 , providing a natural interpretation of the herculis stream .",
    "the depression on the right of this stream may be attributed to the decline of the hot orbit population as @xmath61 .",
    "the high eccentricity @xmath22 region is part of dehnen s valley , but represents _ regular _ olr orbits , and the unstable @xmath29 orbit does not always fall within this valley ( e.g. at @xmath62 and @xmath45 ) .",
    "another property of the hot chaotic regions is that the contours of the velocity distribution follow the lines of constant hamiltonian .",
    "this can be understood in terms of the jeans theorem ( see also the answer to dehnen s question ) : in two - dimensions , chaotic orbits have no other integral of motion than jacobi s integral and thus the distribution function in their neighbourhood depends only on this integral , i.e. on the value of the hamiltonian .",

    "the effect of spiral arms is not yet very clear . as evolving transient features",
    ", they certainly introduce a time dependency of the @xmath0 distributions and probably increase the amount of chaos . since jacobi s integral is then no longer conserved , they may also introduce some diffusion from the regular regions to the chaotic regions and vice versa ( and the same remark is true for massive compact objects like giant molecular clouds ) .",
    "@xmath8-body simulations displaying spiral arms reveal time averaged @xmath0 distributions that are qualitatively similar to those of the test particle simulations presented here , but with an azimuthal phase shift apparently related to the twist of the potential well induced by the spiral arms outside the bar .",
