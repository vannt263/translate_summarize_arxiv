    "interested only in this new proof , this section is mostly self - contained with only occasional references to earlier parts of the paper .",
    "there are numerous open problems and conjectures raised in this paper , some of which we collect in section  [ sec : open_prob ] .",
    "we begin with some notation .",

    "the quotient of @xmath136 modulo reduction of words is @xmath112 , the set of elements of the free group on @xmath76 generators .",
    "for instance , the set @xmath101 introduced before equation is a subset of @xmath136 , so it may contain different words which are equivalent as members of @xmath112 .    for every group @xmath138 and every word @xmath139 , the _ word map _",
    "@xmath140 is defined by substitutions and composition . for @xmath141 , the element @xmath142 is obtained by substituting @xmath143 for each occurrence of @xmath144 in @xmath13 and this for every @xmath145 .",
    "clearly , the word map of @xmath13 is invariant under reductions , so we can regard @xmath13 as an element in @xmath112 .",
    "most research on word maps concerns the range of certain fixed words @xmath13 in a group @xmath138 . more specifically , for @xmath138 finite , it is of interest to understand the distribution induced on @xmath138 by the word map @xmath140 and the uniform distribution on @xmath146 .",
    "this perspective makes it natural to consider an equivalence relation on words ( beyond that of reduction ) .    in order to introduce this equivalence relation ,",
    "we now recall some simple terminology from combinatorial group theory .",
    "there are three _ elementary nielsen transformations _ defined on the free group @xmath112 : ( i ) exchanging any two generators @xmath144 and @xmath147 for some @xmath148 , ( ii ) replacing some @xmath144 with @xmath149 , ( iii ) replacing any @xmath144 by @xmath150 , for some @xmath151 .",

    "we say that two words @xmath153 are equivalent , and denote @xmath154 , if they belong to the same orbit of @xmath152 .",
    "obviously , @xmath155 is an equivalence relation .",
    "it is quite clear that for every finite group @xmath138 , every two equivalent words @xmath153 induce the same distribution on @xmath138 .",
    "we do not know whether the converse is true as well , and we state a specific problem ( conjecture  [ nielsen_conj ] ) in this vein .    given a word @xmath13 and the distribution it induces on a group @xmath138 , it is of interest to consider how far this distribution is from the uniform distribution .",

    "note that for the sake of convenience , we compose permutations from left to right .",
    "this is inconsequential for the analysis of the variables @xmath19 since @xmath169 with left - to - right composition is the inverse of @xmath182 with right - to - left composition , and thus both have the same cycle structure .",
