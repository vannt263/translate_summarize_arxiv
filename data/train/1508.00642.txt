    "chemical processes , such as oxidation , reduction , hydrolysis , nitrification , polymerization , and so forth underpin biological processes . physical processes , particularly solvation , are involved in all the aforementioned chemical and biological processes .",
    "therefore , a prerequisite for the understanding of chemical and biological processes is to study the solvation process . as a physical process , solvation does not involve the formation and/or breaking of any covalent bond , but is associated with solvent and solute electrostatic , dipolar , induced dipolar , and van der waals interactions .",
    "experimentally , solvation can be analyzed by the measurement of solvation free energies .",
    "theoretically , solavtion can be investigated by quantum mechanics , molecular mechanics , integral equation , implicit solvent models , and simple phenomenological modifications of coulomb s law . among",
    ", the implicit solvent models are known to balance the computational complexity and the accuracy in the solvation free energy prediction , and thus , offer an efficient approach .",
    "the general idea of implicit solvent models is to treat the solvent as a dielectric continuum and describe the solute in atomistic detail @xcite .",
    "the total solvation free energy is decomposed into nonpolar and polar parts .",
    "there is a wide variety of ways to carry out this decomposition .",
    "for example , nonpolar energy contributions can be modeled in two stages : the work of displacing solvent when adding a rigid solute to the solvent and the dispersive nonpolar interactions between the solute atoms and surrounding solvent .",
    "the polar part is due to the electrostatic interactions and can be approximated by generalized born ( gb ) @xcite , polarizable continuum ( pc ) @xciteand poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) models @xcite . among them , gb models are heuristic approaches to polar solvation energy analysis .",
    "pc models resort to quantum mechanical calculations of induced solute charges .",
    "pb methods can be formally derived from maxwell equations and statistical mechanics for electrolyte solutions @xcite and therefore offer the promise of handling large biomolecules with sufficient accuracy and robustness @xcite .",
    "conceptually , the separation between continuum solvent and the discrete ( atomistic ) solute introduces an interface definition .",
    "this definition may take the form of analytic functions @xcite or nonsmooth boundaries dividing the solute - solvent domains .",
    "the van der waals surface , solvent accessible surface @xcite , and molecular surface ( ms ) @xcite are devised for this purpose and have found their success in biophysical calculations @xcite .",
    "it has been noticed that the performance of implicit solvent models is very sensitive to the interface definition @xcite .",
    "this comes as no surprise because many of these popular interface definitions are _ ad hoc _ divisions of the solute and solvent domains based on rigid molecular geometry and neglecting solute - solvent energetic interactions .",
    "additionally , geometric singularities @xcite associated with these surface definitions incur enormous computational instability @xcite and lead to conceptual difficulty in interpreting the sharp interface @xcite .",
    "the differential geometry ( dg ) theory of surfaces @xcite and associated geometric partial differential equations ( pdes ) provide a natural description of the solvent - solute interface . in 2005 , wei and his collaborators introduced curvature - controlled pdes for generating molecular surfaces in solvation analysis @xcite . the first variational solvent - solute interface , namely , the minimal molecular surface ( mms ) , was constructed in 2006 by wei and coworkers based on the dg theory of surfaces @xcite .",
    "mmss are constructed by solving the mean curvature flow , or the laplace - beltrami flow , and have been applied to the calculation of electrostatic potentials and solvation free energies @xcite .",
    "this approach was generalized to potential - driven geometric flows , which admit physical interactions , for the surface generation of biomolecules in solution @xcite .",
    "while our approaches were employed and/or modified by many others @xcite for molecular surface and solvation analysis , our geometric pde @xcite and variational surface models @xcite are , to our knowledge , the first of their kind for solvent - solute interface and solvation modeling .",
    "since the surface area minimization is equivalent to the minimization of surface free energies , due to a constant surface tension , this approach can be easily incorporated into the variational formulation of the pb theory @xcite to result in dg - based full solvation models @xcite , following a similar approach by dzubiella _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "our dg - based solvation models have been implemented in the eulerian formulation , where the solvent - solute interface is embedded in the three - dimensional ( 3d ) euclidean space and behaves like a smooth characteristic function @xcite .",
    "the resulting interface and associated dielectric function vary smoothly from their values in the solute domain to those in the solvent domain and are computationally robust .",
    "an alternative implementation is the lagrangian formulation @xcite in which the solvent - solute boundary is extracted as a sharp surface at a given isovalue and subsequently used in the solvation analysis , including nonpolar and polar modeling .",
    "one major advantage of our dg based solvation model is that it enables the synergistic coupling between the solute and solvent domains via the variation procedure . as a result ,",
    "our dg based solvation model is able to significantly reduce the number of free parameters that users must `` fit '' or adjust in applications to real - world systems @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that physical parameters , i.e. , pressure and surface tension obtained from experimental data , can be directly employed in our dg - based solvation models for accurate solvation energy prediction @xcite .",
    "another advantage of our dg based solvation model is that it avoids the use of _ ad hoc _ surface definitions and its interfaces , particularly ones generated from the eulerian formulation @xcite , are free of troublesome geometric singularities that commonly occur in conventional solvent - accessible and solvent - excluded surfaces @xcite . as a result , our dg based solvation model bypasses the sophisticated interface techniques required for solving the pb equation @xcite . in particular , the smooth solvent - solute interface obtained from the eulerian formulation @xcite can be directly interpreted as the physical solvent - solute boundary profile .",
    "additionally , the resulting smooth dielectric boundary can also have a straightforward physical interpretation .",
    "the other advantage of our dg based solvation model is that it is nature and easy to incorporate the density functional theory ( dft ) in its variational formulation .",
    "consequently , it is able to reevaluate and reassign the solute charge induced by solvent polarization effect during the solvation process @xcite .",
    "the resulting total energy minimization process recreates or resembles the solvent - solute interactions , i.e. , polarization , dispersion , and polar and nonpolar coupling in a realistic solvation process .",
    "recently , dg based solvation model has been extended to dg based multiscale models for non - equilibrium processes in biomolecular systems @xcite .",
    "these models recover the dg based solvation model at the equilibrium @xcite .",
    "recently , we have demonstrated @xcite that the dg based nonpolar solvation model is able to outperform many other methods @xcite in solvation energy predictions for a large number nonpolar molecules .",
    "the root mean square error ( rmse ) of our predictions was below 0.4kcal / mol , which clearly indicates the potential power of the dg based solvation formulation .",
    "however , the dg based full solvation model has not shown a similar superiority in accuracy , although it works very well @xcite .",
    "having so many aforementioned advantages , our dg based solvation models ought to outperform other methods with a similar level of approximations .",
    "one obstacle that hinders the performance of our dg based _ full _",
    "solvation model is the numerical instability in solving two strongly coupled and highly nonlinear pdes , namely , the generalized laplace - beltrami ( glb ) equation and the generalized pb ( gpb ) equation . to avoid such instability ,",
    "a strong parameter constraint was applied to the nonpolar part in our earlier work @xcite , which results in the reduction of our model accuracy .",
    "the objective of the present work is to explore a better parameter optimization of our dg based solvation models .",
    "a pair of conditions is prescribed to ensure the physical solution of the glb equation , which leads to the well - posedness of the gpb equation .",
    "such a well - posedness in turn renders the stability of solving the glb equation .",
    "the stable solution of the coupled glb and gpb equation enables us to optimize the model parameters and produce the highly accurate prediction of solvation free energies .",
    "some of the best results are obtained in the solvation free energy prediction of more than a hundred molecules of both polar and nonpolar types .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as the follows . to establish the notation and facilitate further development",
    ", we present a brief review of our dg based solvation models in section [ theory ] . by using the variational principle , we derive the coupled glb and gpb equations .",
    "necessary boundary conditions and initial values are prescribed to make this coupled system well - posed .",
    "section [ algorithm ] is devoted to parameter learning algorithms .",
    "we develop a protocol to stabilize the iterative solution process of coupled nonlinear pdes .",
    "we introduce perturbation and convex optimization methods to ensure stability of the numerical solution of the glb equation in coupling with the gpb equation .",
    "the newly achieved stability in solving the coupled pdes leads to an appropriate minimization of solvation free energies with respect to our model parameters . in section [ numerical - result ]",
    ", we show that for more than a hundred of compounds of various types , including both polar and nonpolar molecules , the present dg solvation model offers some of the most accurate solvation free energy prediction with the overall rmse of 0.5kcal / mol .",
