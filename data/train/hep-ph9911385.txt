    "the search for the higgs boson and , hence , for the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking and fermion mass generation , remains one of the premier tasks of present and future high energy physics experiments .",
    "fits to precision electroweak ( ew ) data have for some time suggested a relatively small higgs boson mass , of order 100  gev  @xcite , which is also the preferred mass range for the lightest higgs boson in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) .    for the intermediate mass range ,",
    "most of the literature has focused on higgs boson production via gluon fusion  @xcite and @xmath3  @xcite or @xmath4  @xcite associated production .",
    "cross sections for standard model ( sm ) higgs boson production at the lhc are well - known  @xcite , and while production via gluon fusion has the largest cross section by almost one order of magnitude , there are substantial qcd backgrounds .",
    "a search for the very clean four - lepton signature from @xmath5 decay can find a higgs boson in the mass region @xmath6  gev , but due to the small branching fraction of this mode very large integrated luminosities , up to 100  fb  @xmath2 or more , are required . for higgs boson masses less than about 140 gev , the inclusive search for @xmath7 events is usually considered the most promising strategy  @xcite ,",
    "while for @xmath8  gev the most promising search is for decay to @xmath9 pairs  @xcite .    the search for mssm higgs bosons must include neutral cp even and cp odd mass eigenstates , as well as charged ones",
    ". the upper mass limit of @xmath10  130  gev  @xcite on the light scalar makes it look similar to its intermediate - mass standard model analogue , for large regions of the mssm parameter space .",
    "while one would expect the most promising channel to again be @xmath11 decay  @xcite , the branching ratio for this mode is even smaller than in the standard model .",
    "the second largest production cross section is predicted for weak - boson fusion ( wbf ) , @xmath12 .",
    "these events contain additional information in their observable quark jets .",
    "techniques like forward jet tagging  @xcite can then be exploited to significantly reduce the backgrounds .",
    "wbf and gluon fusion nicely complement each other : together they allow for a measurement of the @xmath13 coupling ratio .",
    "another feature of the wbf signal is the lack of color exchange between the initial - state quarks .",
    "color coherence between initial- and final - state gluon bremsstrahlung leads to suppressed hadron production in the central region , between the two tagging - jet candidates of the signal  @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to most background processes , which typically involve color exchange in the @xmath14-channel and thus lead to enhanced hadronic activity between the tagging jets .",
    "we exploit these features , via a veto of soft jet activity in the central region  @xcite .",
    "we have previously established the feasibility of wbf intermediate - mass higgs production as both a discovery channel ( via @xmath15 decays  @xcite ) and as a means to provide the first direct higgs boson - fermion coupling measurement  @xcite ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the latter allows one to navely extend the standard model search to the mssm case : the structure of the higgs sector predicts at least one scalar in the intermediate mass range , rendering the @xmath17 channel a crucial test of the mssm  @xcite .",
    "here , we show how the additional channel @xmath18 can be isolated , effectively doubling the available statistics for a measurement of the @xmath19 coupling .",
    "our analysis is a parton - level monte carlo study , using full tree - level matrix elements for the wbf higgs signal and the various backgrounds . in section  [ sec : calc ]",
    "we describe our calculational tools , the methods employed in the simulation of the various processes , and important parameters . in section  [ sec : analysis ] we demonstrate how forward jet tagging , a @xmath20 veto , and lepton cuts can be combined to yield an @xmath212/1 to 1/2 signal - to - background ( s / b ) ratio , depending on the higgs mass .",
    "the different minijet patterns in signal and background processes are discussed in section  [ sec : minijet ] .",
    "we describe how they can be used to achieve additional large suppression of the qcd backgrounds relative to the signal .",
    "combined with the results of section  [ sec : analysis ] this yields production cross sections of signal and backgrounds as given in table  [ summary ] , which summarizes our results . in section  [ sec : mssm ] we reanalyze the impact on covering the mssm parameter space and discuss the luminosity requirement at the lhc for which the entire @xmath22 plane can be covered . a final discussion of our results and conclusions is given in section  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "we simulate @xmath23 collisions at the cern lhc , @xmath24  tev .",
    "all signal and background cross sections are determined in terms of full tree - level matrix elements for the contributing subprocesses and are discussed in more detail below .    for all our numerical results we have chosen @xmath25 , @xmath26  gev , and @xmath27 , which translates into @xmath28  gev and @xmath29 when using the tree - level relations between these input parameters .",
    "this value for @xmath30 is somewhat lower than the current world average of @xmath31 gev .",
    "however , this difference has negligible effects on all cross sections , e.g. the @xmath32 signal cross section varies by about @xmath33 between these two @xmath9 mass values .",
    "the tree level relations between the input parameters are kept in order to guarantee electroweak gauge invariance of all amplitudes . for all qcd effects , the running of the strong coupling constant",
    "is evaluated at one - loop order , with @xmath34 .",
    "we employ cteq4l parton distribution functions  @xcite throughout . unless otherwise noted the factorization scale is chosen as @xmath35 min(@xmath36 ) of the defined jets .",
    "the signal can be described , at lowest order , by two single - feynman - diagram processes , @xmath38 , i.e. @xmath39 and @xmath40 fusion where the weak bosons are emitted from the incoming quarks  @xcite . because of the small higgs boson width in the mass range of interest , these events can reliably be simulated in the narrow width approximation . from previous studies of @xmath7",
    "@xcite , @xmath1  @xcite and @xmath41  @xcite decays in weak boson fusion we know several features of the signal , which can be exploited here also : the centrally produced higgs boson tends to yield central decay products ( in this case @xmath42 ) , and the two quarks enter the detector at large rapidity compared to the @xmath43 s and with transverse momenta in the 20 to 100 gev range , thus leading to two observable forward tagging jets .    for the study of a central jet veto",
    ", we utilize the results of previous studies where we simulated the emission of at least one extra parton  @xcite .",
    "this was achieved by calculating the cross sections for the process @xmath44 ,",
    "i.e. weak boson fusion with radiation of an additional gluon , and all crossing related processes .",
    "we note that the signal simulations , with decays to tau pairs replaced by decays to @xmath9 pairs , which in turn decay leptonically , will ultimately also be a source of background for the @xmath1 signal under study .      given the h decay signature , the main physics background to our @xmath46 signal arises from @xmath47 production , due to the large top production cross section at the lhc and because the branching ratio @xmath48 is essentially @xmath49 .    the basic process we consider is @xmath50 , which can be either @xmath51- or @xmath52-initiated , with the former strongly dominating at the lhc .",
    "qcd corrections to this lead to additional real parton emission , i.e. to @xmath53 events .",
    "relevant subprocesses are g q t |t q , g |q t |t |q , q |q t |t g , g g t |t g , and the subprocesses for @xmath54 events can be obtained similarly . for the case of no additional partons ,",
    "the @xmath20 s from the decaying top quarks may be identified as the tagging jets . at the same time",
    ", we can identify a distinctly different , perturbative region of phase space , where the final - state light quark or gluon gives rise to one tagging jet , and one of the two decay @xmath20 s is identified as the other tagging jet .",
    "finally , there is a third distinct region of phase space , for the perturbative hard process @xmath55 , where the final - state light quarks or gluons are the two tagging jets .",
    "the @xmath56 and @xmath57 matrix elements were constructed using madgraph  @xcite , while the @xmath58 matrix elements are from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "decays of the top quarks and @xmath9 s are included in the matrix elements ; however , while the @xmath9 s are allowed to be off - shell , the top quarks are required to be on - shell .",
    "this approximation neglects the contribution from @xmath59 production , which has been shown to be comparable to @xmath60 rates in studies of the @xmath41 signal  @xcite",
    ". we will compensate by being conservative in assessing minijet veto probabilities for top backgrounds .",
    "note that these approximations are not critical because backgrounds with real @xmath9 pairs can be distinguished quite effectively from @xmath17 events and the real top decay backgrounds that we consider will be shown to constitute a minor fraction of the final backgrounds . in the calculation of the @xmath60 background energy loss from @xmath61 is included to generate more accurate @xmath62 distributions . in all cases ,",
    "the factorization scale is chosen as @xmath35 min(@xmath63 ) of the massless partons / top quarks .",
    "as in our earlier work  @xcite , the overall strong coupling constant factors are taken as @xmath64 , where the product runs over all light quarks , gluons and top quarks .",
    "the semileptonic decays of bottom or charm quarks provide another source of leptons and neutrinos which can be misidentified as tau decays .",
    "these heavy quark pairs are produced strongly and a priori one is dealing with a very large potential background .",
    "it can be reduced by several orders of magnitude , however , by requiring the leptons from the decay of the heavy quarks to be isolated .",
    "because of the softer fragmentation function of a @xmath66-quark as compared to @xmath20-quarks , leptons from charm decay are much less likely to be isolated than @xmath20-decay leptons . in the phase space region of interest to us , where both heavy quarks must reside in the central angular region and have substantial transverse momentum , the production cross sections for charm and bottom pairs are roughly equal . as a result",
    "we consider only the @xmath20-quark background in the following .",
    "in addition to the two high transverse momentum @xmath20-quarks , which both must undergo semileptonic decay , two forward tagging jets will be required as part of the signal event selection .",
    "the relevant leading order process therefore is the production of @xmath67 pairs in association with two jets , which includes the subprocesses gg b|b gg , qg b|b qg , q_1 q_2 b|b q_1 q_2 .",
    "the exact matrix elements for the @xmath68 processes are evaluated , including all the crossing related subprocesses , and retaining a finite @xmath20-quark mass  @xcite .",
    "the pauli interference terms between identical quark flavors in the process @xmath69 are neglected , with little effect in the overall cross section , due to the large difference in the rapidity of the final state light quarks .",
    "the factorization and renormalization scales are chosen as in the analogous @xmath70 case .",
    "the semileptonic decay @xmath71 of both of the @xmath20-quarks is simulated by multiplying the @xmath72 cross section by a branching ratio factor of 0.0218 ( corresponding to an @xmath73 or @xmath74 final state ) and by implementing the @xmath75 decay distributions of the @xmath20-quarks in the collinear limit .",
    "the collinear approximation for the @xmath71 decay is appropriate here because the lepton transverse momentum and @xmath62 cuts to be imposed below force the parent @xmath20-quarks to move relativistically in the lab . denoting the neutrino and charged lepton energy fractions by @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively , the double differential @xmath20-quark decay distribution is given by  @xcite @xmath78 \\nonumber\\\\          & + 3ry_\\ell\\;{(2-c)\\;x_\\nu+c \\over 1-x_\\nu - y_\\ell } \\ ; \\biggr)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] assuming an unpolarized initial @xmath20-quark .",
    "here @xmath79 , and the dependence on the final state charm quark mass , @xmath80 , is absorbed into the correction term @xmath81 finally , @xmath82 is the width suppression factor for the @xmath83 decay due to the finite charm quark mass , @xmath84 in our numerical simulations we set @xmath85  gev and @xmath86  gev , i.e. we use the lightest meson masses in order to approximately obtain the correct kinematics for the heavy quark decays . in ref .",
    "@xcite a factor 100 reduction of the @xmath67 background was found as a result of lepton isolation for a single @xmath83 decay , requiring @xmath87  gev in a cone of radius 0.6 around the charged lepton of @xmath88  gev . in our simulation , after energy smearing of the charm quark jet ( see below ) , we reproduce this reduction factor .",
    "the suppression from lepton isolation is smaller for lower @xmath89 cuts .",
    "we model these effects by using eq .",
    "( [ eq : d2gdxdy ] ) .",
    "since our suppression of @xmath83 decays from lepton isolation strongly depends on the energy resolution assumed for the very soft charm quark jet , the determination of heavy quark backgrounds should eventually be repeated with a full detector simulation .",
    "we will show , however , that the @xmath72 background is truly negligible after all the selection cuts to be described in this paper .",
    "therefore , the approximate treatment of these backgrounds is sufficient for our purposes .",
    "the next obvious backgrounds arise from z decays to real @xmath43 s which then decay leptonically .",
    "thus , we need to study real - emission qcd corrections to the drell - yan process @xmath91 . for @xmath92 events",
    "these background processes include  @xcite q g q g ^+ ^- , q q q q ^+ ^- , which are dominated by @xmath14-channel gluon exchange , and all crossing - related processes , such as q |q g g ^+ ^- , g g q |q ^+ ^- .",
    "all interference effects between virtual photon and @xmath93-exchange are included .",
    "we call these processes collectively the `` qcd @xmath94 '' background .",
    "similar to the treatment of the signal processes , we use a parton - level monte - carlo program based on the work of ref .",
    "@xcite to model the qcd @xmath94 background .    from our study of @xmath1 in weak boson fusion  @xcite",
    ", we know that the ew ( t - channel weak boson exchange ) cross section for @xmath95 production will be comparable to the qcd cross section in the phase space region of interest .",
    "we use the results of ref .",
    "@xcite for modeling the ew @xmath94 background .",
    "the dual leptonic decays of the @xmath43 s are simulated by multiplying the @xmath96 cross section by a branching ratio factor of @xmath97 and by implementing the lepton energy distributions for collinear tau decays , with helicity correlations included as in our previous analysis of @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "we must further consider any other significant source of one electron , one muon and significant @xmath62 to make a realistic analysis of the backgrounds .",
    "an obvious candidate arises from real - emission qcd corrections to @xmath99 production , with subsequent decay of the two @xmath9`s to electrons or muons . for @xmath100 events",
    "these background processes include  @xcite q g q g w^+ w^- , q q ' q q w^+ w^- , which are dominated by @xmath14-channel gluon exchange , and all crossing related processes , such as q |q g g w^+ w^- , g g q |q w^+ w^- .",
    "we call these processes collectively the `` qcd @xmath101 '' background . to estimate the minijet activity in these events we use the results for qcd @xmath102 processes , which are kinematically similar  @xcite",
    ".    note that we neglect @xmath103 decays in our simulation of @xmath101 backgrounds .",
    "this is justified by the suppressed leptonic branching ratio of the @xmath43 decays .",
    "we show below that the @xmath104 backgrounds are already negligible and , therefore , the extra @xmath105 decays do not need to be analyzed in detail .",
    "these backgrounds , analogous to qcd @xmath101 production , arise from @xmath99 bremsstrahlung in quark-(anti)quark scattering via @xmath14-channel electroweak boson exchange , with subsequent decay @xmath106 : qq qq w^+w^- navely , this ew background may be thought of as suppressed compared to the analogous qcd process above .",
    "however , it includes electroweak boson fusion , @xmath107 via @xmath108- or @xmath14-channel @xmath109-exchange or via @xmath110 4-point vertices , which has a momentum and color structure identical to the signal .",
    "thus , it can not easily be suppressed via cuts .",
    "the matrix elements for these processes were constructed using madgraph  @xcite .",
    "we include charged - current ( cc ) and neutral - current ( nc ) processes , but discard s - channel ew boson and t - channel quark exchange processes as their contribution was found to be only @xmath111 , while adding significantly to the cpu time needed for the calculation . in general , for the regions of phase space containing far - forward and -backward tagging jets , s - channel processes are severely suppressed .",
    "we refer collectively to these processes as the `` ew @xmath101 '' background .",
    "both @xmath9 s are allowed to be off - shell , and all off - resonance graphs are included .",
    "in addition , the higgs boson graphs must be included to make the calculation well - behaved at large @xmath9-pair invariant masses .",
    "however , it is convenient to separate continuum @xmath9-pair production from the very narrow @xmath112 resonance .",
    "we do this by setting @xmath113 to 60  gev in the ew @xmath101 background which effectively removes the @xmath108-channel higgs contribution .",
    "the @xmath112 background is then calculated separately for  each higgs boson mass under consideration .",
    "a clean separation of the higgs boson signal and the ew @xmath101 background is possible because interference effects between the two are negligible for the higgs boson mass range of interest .",
    "the effects of additional gluon radiation are estimated by using the results of refs .",
    "@xcite for ew @xmath94 events , which are directly applied here .",
    "the ew @xmath94 and ew @xmath101 backgrounds are quite similar kinematically , which justifies the use of the same veto probabilities for central jets .      the qcd processes discussed above lead to steeply falling jet transverse momentum distributions .",
    "as a result , finite detector resolution can have a sizable effect on cross sections .",
    "these resolution effects are taken into account via gaussian smearing of the energies of jets/@xmath20 s and charged leptons .",
    "we use @xmath114 for central jets ( with individual terms added in quadrature ) , based on atlas expectations  @xcite . for charged leptons",
    "we use @xmath115 in addition , finite detector resolution leads to fake missing - transverse - momentum in events with hard jets .",
    "an atlas analysis  @xcite showed that these effects are well parameterized by a gaussian distribution of the components of the fake missing transverse momentum vector , @xmath116 , with resolution @xmath117 for each component . in our calculations",
    ", these fake missing transverse momentum vectors are added linearly to the neutrino momenta .",
    "the @xmath118 double leptonic decay signal is characterized by two forward jets and the @xmath43 decay leptons ( @xmath119 ) . before discussing background levels and further details like minijet radiation patterns ,",
    "we need to identify the search region for these hard @xmath120 events .",
    "the task is identical to the higgs searches in @xmath121 which were considered previously  @xcite . we can thus adopt the strategy of these earlier analyses and start out by discussing a basic level of cuts on the @xmath122 signal",
    "throughout this section we assume a higgs mass of @xmath123  gev for illustration purposes , but we do not optimize cuts for this mass .",
    "the minimum acceptance requirements ensure that the two jets and two charged leptons are observed inside the detector ( within the hadronic and electromagnetic calorimeters , respectively ) , and are well - separated from each other : [ eq : basic ] & p_t_j 20  gev , |_j| 5.0 , r_jj 0.7 , + & p_t _ 10  gev , |_| 2.5 , r_j 0.7 . the charged leptons must be isolated in order to reduce backgrounds from heavy quark decays .",
    "thus a minimum angular distance must be imposed on the electron and the muon signaling the tau decays : @xmath124 this has negligible effect on the higgs boson signal .",
    "a feature of the qcd @xmath95 and @xmath101 backgrounds is the generally higher rapidity of the @xmath93 or @xmath9 s as compared to the higgs signal : weak boson bremsstrahlung occurs at small angles with respect to the parent quarks , producing a @xmath93 or @xmath9 s forward of the jets .",
    "thus , we also require both @xmath125 s to lie between the jets with a separation in pseudorapidity @xmath126 , and the jets to occupy opposite hemispheres : @xmath127 finally , to reach the starting point for our consideration of the signal and various backgrounds , a wide separation in pseudorapidity is required between the two forward tagging jets , @xmath128 leaving a gap of at least 3 units of pseudorapidity in which the charged leptons can be observed . forward",
    "jet tagging has been discussed as an effective technique to separate weak boson scattering from various backgrounds in the past   @xcite , in particular for heavy higgs boson searches .",
    "line 1 of table  [ taudata_all ] shows the effect of the above cuts on the signal and backgrounds for a sm higgs boson of mass @xmath123  gev .",
    "overall , about @xmath129 of all @xmath130 events generated in weak boson fusion are accepted by the cuts of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : basic])-([eq : gap ] ) ( for @xmath123  gev ) .",
    "as is readily seen from the first line of table  [ taudata_all ] , the dominant backgrounds are @xmath119 pairs from heavy quark decays . of the @xmath131 events 14  fb are from @xmath56 , @xmath132  fb are from @xmath57 , and",
    "the remaining @xmath133  fb arise from @xmath58 production .",
    "the additional jets ( corresponding to massless partons ) are required to be identified as far forward tagging jets .",

    "the results summarized in table  [ summary ] show that it is possible to isolate a low - background @xmath181 signal for the sm higgs boson at the lhc .",

    "gev still requires less than 90  fb@xmath2 of data , assuming low luminosity conditions . above @xmath183  gev",

    "@xcite one effectively doubles the available statistics for the @xmath1 decay mode , making observation of this decay possible with significantly less than 60  fb@xmath2 of data , and ultimately providing a number of cross checks for the individual analyses . in the mssm framework",
    "the combination of the two decay modes yields a @xmath173 signal for @xmath185  fb@xmath2 of data with an arbitrary choice of mssm parameters which are still allowed by lep data",
    ".    the expected purity of the signal is demonstrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : mtautau ] , where the reconstructed @xmath17 invariant mass distribution for a sm higgs boson of mass 120  gev is shown , together with the various backgrounds , after application of all cuts , i d efficiencies and a minijet veto .",
    "this purity is made possible because the weak boson fusion process , together with the @xmath186 decay , provides a complex signal , with a multitude of characteristics which distinguish it from the various backgrounds .",
    "the basic feature of the @xmath32 signal is the presence of two forward tagging jets inside the acceptance region of the lhc detectors , of sizable @xmath36 , and of dijet invariant mass in the tev range .",
    "typical qcd backgrounds , with isolated charged leptons and two hard jets , are much softer .",
    "in addition , the qcd backgrounds are dominated by @xmath9 bremsstrahlung off forward scattered quarks , which give typically higher - rapidity charged leptons . in contrast , the ew processes give rise to quite central leptons , and this includes not only the higgs signal but also ew @xmath101 and @xmath94 production , which also proceed via weak boson fusion .",
    "it is this similarity that prevents one from ignoring ew analogs to background qcd processes , which a priori are smaller by two orders of magnitude in total cross section , but after basic cuts remain the same size as their qcd counterparts .",
    "in addition to various invariant mass and angular cuts , one can discriminate between the real @xmath43 s of the signal ( and of the qcd and ew @xmath94 backgrounds ) and `` fake '' @xmath43 s from the @xmath187 backgrounds .",
    "this is possible because the high energy of the produced @xmath43 s makes their decay products almost collinear .",
    "combined with the substantial @xmath36 of the @xmath42 system this allows for @xmath43-pair mass reconstruction .",
    "the @xmath9 decays do not exhibit this collinearity due to their modest boost in the lab frame .",
    "this leads to markedly different angular correlations between the @xmath147 vector and the charged lepton momenta .",
    "our real-@xmath43 criteria make use of these differences and largely eliminate the non-@xmath43 backgrounds .",
    "we advocate taking advantage of an additional fundamental characteristic of qcd and ew processes .",
    "color - singlet exchange in the @xmath14-channel , as encountered in higgs boson production by weak boson fusion ( and in the ew @xmath95 background ) , leads to additional soft jet activity which differs strikingly from that expected for the qcd backgrounds in both geometry and hardness : gluon radiation in qcd processes is typically both harder and more central than in wbf processes .",
    "we exploit this radiation , via a veto on events with central minijets of @xmath136  gev , and expect a typical @xmath188 reduction in qcd backgrounds and about a @xmath189 suppression of ew backgrounds , but only about a @xmath159 loss of the signal .",
    "we have identified the most important distributions for enhancing the signal relative to the background , and set the various cuts conservatively to avoid bias for a certain higgs boson mass range .",
    "there is ample room for improvement of our results . a multivariate analysis of a complete set of signal and background distributions",
    "is expected to lead to improved background suppression .",
    "mass specific cuts should eventually be employed and will improve matters as is evident from , e.g. , the angular and lepton invariant mass distributions of figs .",
    "[ fig : angdist],[fig : mll ] . additional suppression of the @xmath47 background may be possible with @xmath20 identification and veto in the @xmath190  gev region .",
    "we do not pursue these questions here .",
    "one reason is that our results are derived at the parton level only .",
    "even though we have included expected detector resolution effects and losses due to finite trigger and detection efficiencies , a more complete detector simulation is now needed .",
    "we have to leave this work to our experimental colleagues .",
    "the very promising results of this study suggest that the @xmath191 modes should also be considered . the dilepton invariant mass distribution of fig .",
    "[ fig : mll ] shows that elimination of the @xmath93 peak in @xmath192 backgrounds would reduce the higgs signal by a small amount only .",
    "in addition , the requirement of significant @xmath62 ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : ptmiss ] ) ) is expected to largely eliminate qcd or ew @xmath95 production , leaving @xmath193 and @xmath194 events with invisible @xmath93 or @xmath9 decays as the additional backgrounds .",
    "given our results for the analogous @xmath101 events we expect these new backgrounds to be minimal .",
    "this implies that the purely leptonic @xmath1 signal can most likely be enhanced by almost another factor of two , further reducing the integrated luminosity required for observation of the @xmath1 signal .",
    "measuring the higgs - fermion coupling will be an important test of the standard model as well as its supersymmetric extension .",
    "for such a measurement , via the analysis outlined in this paper , minijet veto probabilities must be precisely known . for calibration purposes",
    ", one can analyze @xmath95 events at the lhc .",
    "the production rates of the qcd and ew @xmath95 events can be reliably predicted and , thus , the observation of the @xmath195 peak allows for a direct experimental assessment of the minijet veto efficiencies , in a kinematic configuration very similar to the higgs signal .",
    "_ in summary : _ observation of the sm or mssm higgs scalar(s ) via @xmath196 in weak boson fusion is possible at the lhc with modest integrated luminosities , if the higgs boson lies in the mass range between about 100 and 140 gev .",
    "extending the search range upward to 150 gev should eventually be possible .",
