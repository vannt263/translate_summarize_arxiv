    "since the initial formulation three decades ago lattice qcd has developed into a reliable quantitative tool for studying many low energy phenomena in qcd . however , one important issue where the lattice approach has essentially failed so far is its application to qcd at finite density .",
    "the reason is that at finite chemical potential @xmath0 the fermion determinant becomes complex and can not be used as a probability weight in a monte carlo simulation .",
    "this is know as the  complex action problem  or  sign problem  .",
    "one of the attempts to overcome the complex action problem is based on taylor expansion in @xmath0 around the @xmath1 theory such that the expansion coefficients can be computed with conventional monte carlo simulations .",
    "the taylor expansion suffers from two problems : the simulations performed at @xmath1 for the determination of the expansion coefficients may be governed by physics that is rather different from the finite density phenomena one wants to study  this is known as the  overlap problem  .",
    "the second problem is the unknown and probably rather small region of convergence of the expansion .    however , taylor expansion is not the only expansion that might be used for extrapolating from @xmath1 to finite @xmath0 , and other series might have better convergence and/or better overlap properties . in this paper",
    "we study the conventional taylor expansion , but also the fugacity series and in addition propose a modified taylor expansion which captures some features of the fugacity expansion but at a much lower numerical cost .",
    "the three different series expansions are implemented in an effective theory of qcd containing the leading center symmetric and center symmetry breaking terms for polyakov loops represented by @xmath2-valued spins on a 3-dimensional lattice .",
    "the model is often referred to as ",
    "@xmath2 spin model  and has the advantage that it can be rewritten exactly to new variables , a so - called flux representation , where the partition sum has only real and positive terms . in the flux representation",
    "the complex action problem thus is solved and monte carlo simulations are possible at arbitrary @xmath0 .",
    "the results of the simulation in the flux representation then serve as reference data for the series expansions we want to study .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we briefly review the @xmath2 spin model and aspects of its simulation with the flux representation .",
    "subsequently we present and work out the three series expansions for the spin model .",
    "section 4 contains the numerical results and the comparison of the series expansions .",
    "we conclude with a discussion .",
    "an effective theory @xcite for the polyakov loop in pure gauge theory can be computed in strong coupling and gives rise to a nearest neighbor interaction of traced su(3 ) spins on a 3-dimensional lattice .",
    "subsequently the polyakov loop spins may be reduced to the center group of su(3 ) , i.e. , to spins in @xmath2 .",
    "the fermion determinant breaks the center symmetry explicitly .",
    "the corresponding leading center symmetry breaking terms may be obtained from hopping expansion which represents the fermion determinant as a set of closed loops .",
    "the shortest loop that breaks center symmetry is the polyakov loop .",
    "it is also the leading contribution that couples to the chemical potential which gives a different weight to forward and backward running loops .",
    "the action of the resulting @xmath2 spin model @xcite reads @xmath3 \\ ;   = \\ ; - \\sum_x \\left ( \\tau   \\sum_{\\nu = 1}^{3 } \\left [ p_x p_{x + \\hat{\\nu}}^ *   + c.c .",
    "\\right ] + \\eta p_x + \\bar{\\eta}p_x^ * \\right ) , \\label{z3effectiveaction}\\ ] ] where the polyakov loops are represented by the spins @xmath4 which are elements of @xmath5 .",
    "the first sum runs over all sites @xmath6 of a @xmath7 lattice with periodic boundary conditions and @xmath8 denotes the unit vector in @xmath9-direction .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath0 enters through @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "we remark that actually the leading @xmath0-dependent terms form the loop expansion of the fermion determinant would come with factors @xmath12 , while in our effective action we have the factors @xmath13 . in other words , for the spin model the chemical potential is rescaled with the inverse temperature @xmath14 .",
    "the parameter @xmath15 in front of the nearest neighbor term is increasing with temperature , whereas @xmath16 is increasing with decreasing qcd quark mass and is proportional to the number of flavors .",
    "the grand canonical partition sum @xmath17 is obtained as a sum over all configurations @xmath18 of the variables , i.e. , @xmath19}$ ] .",
    "simple observables one may study are the expectation value of the polyakov loop @xmath20 of the polyakov loop and the corresponding polyakov loop susceptibility @xmath21 .",
    "observables related to the particle number density are obtained as derivatives of @xmath22 with respect to the chemical potential @xmath0 .",
    "they turn out to be related to linear combinations of @xmath23 and @xmath21 .",
    "it is obvious that in the standard representation the action ( [ z3effectiveaction ] ) is complex for @xmath24 and conventional monte carlo techniques fail .",
    "the severity of the complex action problem depends on the parameters @xmath25 and @xmath0 .",
    "later we will see that also convergence properties of the various series expansions are related to the severity of the complex action problem . in order to assess the severity of the complex action problem , in fig .",
    "[ cap ] we show results for @xmath26 as a function of @xmath0 for @xmath27 ( lhs .  plot ) and @xmath28 ( rhs . ) on @xmath29 lattices for different values of @xmath15 .",

    "the system can be simulated with a generalization of the prokofev - svistunov worm algorithm @xcite and observables can be studied for arbitrary chemical potential @xcite . for @xmath1 and sufficiently small @xmath16",
    "the model has a first order phase transition as a function of @xmath15 which continues as a short first order line ending in a second order point when increasing @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "when @xmath16 and @xmath0 are sufficiently large one only finds a smooth crossover between @xmath34 ( confinement ) and @xmath35 ( deconfinement ) .",
    "having at hand a model that shows a similar complex action problem as qcd and at the same time has a flux representation where simulations at finite @xmath0 are possible without problems , is perfect for assessing the applicability of series expansions in the chemical potential .",
    "we will see that all three series , fugacity , taylor and improved taylor expansion are straightforward to implement in the @xmath2 spin model and the flux simulation provides the reference data to assess the results from the series expansions .",
    "in this section we discuss the three series expansions we study in this paper .",
    "first we present the series expansion in general terms such that the formulation for qcd is transparent and then work out the specific form for the @xmath2 spin model .",
    "the fugacity expansion expresses the grand canonical partition sum @xmath17 as a laurent series in the fugacity parameter @xmath36 , @xmath37 where the sum runs over all net particle numbers @xmath38 , which give the difference between particles and anti - particle numbers .",
    "the expansion coefficients are the canonical partition sums @xmath39 that may be obtained as the fourier moments of the grand canonical partition sum with imaginary chemical potential @xmath40 .",

    "the corresponding fourier integrals need to be evaluated numerically , which is a very expensive calculation , despite the fact that a dimensional reduction formula @xcite may be used to speed up the evaluation of the @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "thus it seems reasonable to first test the fugacity expansion in a model where reliable results at finite @xmath0 are available , which is the issue of this paper .    for the @xmath2 spin model we can implement the fugacity expansion in exactly the same way as in qcd ( with the difference that in the spin model the inverse temperature @xmath14 is absorbed in the definition of @xmath0 ) .",

    "a part of the motivation for this type of expansion is to capture some of the features of the fugacity expansion , which in the case of qcd would lead to a finite laurent series , whereas the regular taylor expansion gives rise to an infinite series .    for the ite",

    "we display the results from different truncation orders of the ite ( the order of a term is defined as the sum of the orders of @xmath91- and @xmath92-factors ) , and compare them to the reference results from the dual simulation .    as for the rte ,",

    "the sign problem is more severe for the light quarks ( compare also fig .  [ cap ] ) , and thus for the light quarks @xmath28 we expect the series to fail already at smaller @xmath0 than in the heavy quark case @xmath27 .",

    "[ q_vergl ] and [ p_vergl ] ) the situation is very similar : the two taylor expansions reproduce the dual simulation data only for small chemical potential , while the fugacity expansion has a larger interval of good convergence , at least up to @xmath108 for the @xmath27 data , and only for the largest value of @xmath0 we display , the failure of the fugacity series becomes manifest .",
    "it is interesting to note , that a comparison of the range of convergence of the fugacity series with fig .",
    "[ cap ] for the severity of the complex action problem indicates , that only the fugacity series seems to be predominantly limited by the complex action problem . for both @xmath28 and @xmath27",
    "we see that the fugacity series is reliable for the entire range of @xmath0 values where @xmath109 ( and for @xmath28 even slightly further ) .",
    "this is different for the two taylor expansions , which break down already at values of @xmath0 smaller than what would look doable from the @xmath110 data in fig .",
    "this underlines that the fugacity expansion has a larger @xmath0-range of applicability than the taylor series .    for the second derivative observable @xmath21 shown in fig .",
    "[ chip_vergl ] , we find essentially the same behavior as for the first order derivatives @xmath38 and @xmath105 , i.e. , the two taylor expansions break down considerably earlier than the fugacity series , where the applicability of the latter seems to be limited mainly by the complex action problem , while the taylor series seem to have additional convergence issues , in particular fluctuations from higher order terms .",
    "however , a different feature is that for @xmath21 the improved taylor series ite seems to be slightly better than the rte , in particular at @xmath28 .",
    "in the work reported here , we assess fugacity- , regular taylor- and improved taylor expansion in the @xmath2 spin model and compare the results from the series expansions in the chemical potential @xmath0 to the outcome of simulations in the dual formulation where the complex action problem is absent .",
    "we study the reliability of the series expansions in reproducing bulk observables at various values of the chemical potential .",
    "our analysis shows that the fugacity expansion clearly outperforms the two taylor series expansions for all parameter values we studied .",
    "the convergence of the results seems to be limited exclusively by the severity of the sign problem , while for the two taylor series other issues , such as fluctuating terms from higher contributions limit the applicability . for some parameter values we observed a slight superiority of the improved taylor expansion ite .",
    "one goal of the current paper was to analyze in a qcd - related model system whether the much larger numerical cost of an implementation of the fugacity expansion is worth the effort when compared to taylor expansion techniques .",
