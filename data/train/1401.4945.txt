    "silicon photonics is a well established area of research aiming at exploiting silicon ( si ) as a photonic component for the engineering of integrated optoelectronic devices .",
    "the extraordinary optical properties of si open up possibilities for novel miniaturized applications , ranging from optical interconnection to bio - sensing @xcite . in the mid - infrared",
    ", si has a high refractive index ( @xmath0 ) and negligible linear extinction .",
    "however , in the range 1 @xmath1 m @xmath2 2.2 @xmath1 m , two photon absorption ( 2pa ) is relevant and is responsible for high nonlinear extinction @xcite . owing to the high refractive index",
    ", light can be tightly localized in subwavelength si - based waveguides @xcite , which tremendously enhance nonlinear processes @xcite , including 2pa that damps optical propagation and limits the efficiency of si - based photonic components @xcite . as a consequence of 2pa ,",
    "pairs of photons with total energy greater than the si band - gap ( @xmath3 ev ) are absorbed and electrons are excited to the conduction band modifying the si optical response @xcite . in this interesting and rather unexplored operating regime ,",
    "free - carriers ( fcs ) directly interact with the optical field and introduce novel nonlinear effects @xcite .",
    "a quite similar scenario happens in gas - filled hollow core photonic crystal fibers ( hcpcfs ) in the ionization regime , where accelerating solitons @xcite and universal modulational instability @xcite have been recently observed . in this case , the free plasma generated through ionization is responsible for an intense _ blueshift _ of several hundreds of nanometers of the optical pulse @xcite .",
    "this tremendous dynamics occurs in a much smaller scale ( blueshift of few nanometers ) in si - based waveguides @xcite because of the intimate presence of 2pa , which is responsible for both the creation of fcs and for damping . in principle",
    ", losses can be reduced in hybrid slot waveguides @xcite , but in this case also the extraordinary effects ensuing from fc dynamics are reduced accordingly .    an alternative strategy for overcoming losses",
    "consists of embedding si waveguides in gaining media . in this context , amplification schemes based on iii - v semiconductors @xcite , rare - earth - ion - doped dielectric thin films @xcite and erbium - doped waveguides",
    "@xcite have been proposed and practically realized . the paradigm model for describing optical propagation in amplifying waveguides",
    "is represented by the cubic ginzburg - landau ( gl ) equation , which governs a wide range of dissipative phenomena @xcite . in general ,",
    "gl systems are rich in nature and exhibit some peculiar features , e.g. , chaos and pattern formation @xcite .",
    "conversely to the case of conventional kerr solitons arising from the balance between nonlinearity and dispersion @xcite , localized stationary solutions of gl systems - namely _ dissipative solitons _ - result from the exact compensation of gain and loss @xcite . in a recent work ,",
    "we investigated the fc - induced dynamics of dissipative solitons in si - based amplifying waveguides , demonstrating the self - frequency soliton blueshift @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we theoretically investigate the propagation of continuous waves ( cws ) in a silicon - on - insulator ( soi ) waveguide embedded in erbium - doped amorphous aluminium oxide ( al@xmath4o@xmath5:er@xmath6 ) .",
    "owing to the externally pumped active inclusions , small optical waves are exponentially amplified and instability develops until the nonlinear gain saturation comes into play counterbalancing the linear amplification . taking full account of fc generation and recombination , we calculate the stationary nonlinear cws of the system and we investigate their stability .",
    "we find that , analogously to gas - filled hcpcfs @xcite , stationary cws are universally unstable in both normal and anomalous dispersion regimes .",
    "however , due to the inherent non - conservative nature of our system , modulational instability ( mi ) does not generate a shower of solitons as in ref .",
    "@xcite , but an _ accelerating chaotic state_. this scenario ensues from the presence of unstable dissipative solitons , which constitute the strange attractor of the system @xcite .",
    "every sub - pulse generated through mi is accelerated by the fc dispersion and experiences self - frequency blue - shift . in turn , the overall dynamics accelerates in the temporal domain and blueshifts in the frequency domain .",

    "ii we describe the geometry of the system , introducing the governing equations and calculating the nonlinear stationary cw modes . in section iii",
