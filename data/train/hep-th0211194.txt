    "over the last decade there has been enormous progress in our understanding of supersymmetric field theories , aided by the discovery of non - perturbative dualities both in field theory and in string theory . in general",
    "there has been much less progress in the non - supersymmetric case .",
    "however , there was one notable exception where the dualities actually gave information about a non - supersymmetric theory ; namely , motivated from ads / cft , it was observed in @xcite that one should expect certain non - supersymmetric orbifolds of @xmath4 super yang - mills to be conformal at least in the large @xmath1 limit .",
    "subsequently this statement was proven , first using string theory in @xcite and more generally in field theory in @xcite .",
    "the proof consists in showing that the leading diagrams in the large @xmath1 expansion satisfy a kind of `` inheritance principle , '' meaning they are equal in parent and daughter theories ( up to a rescaling of the coupling constant . )",
    "this proof in fact applies even when one starts with a non - conformal theory .",
    "recently it was conjectured by strassler @xcite that the inheritance principle might hold even nonperturbatively in the t hooft coupling . as he pointed out , if this conjecture is true , it is a powerful tool for obtaining nonperturbative information , exact in the large @xmath1 limit , in some nonsupersymmetric theories  namely those which can be obtained as orbifolds of @xmath5 super yang - mills , which has been well understood nonperturbatively for a long time .",
    "but the conjecture is difficult to check ; in @xcite it was suggested that the best avenue for testing it would be lattice simulations .",
    "on the other hand , it was recently shown @xcite that , in supersymmetric gauge theories with a large @xmath1 expansion , all holomorphic quantities  including ones which receive nonperturbative corrections  can be calculated by minimizing a potential which is calculated solely perturbatively and indeed receives contributions only from planar diagrams .",
    "these planar diagrams are not precisely of the type considered in @xcite but we will show that they nevertheless satisfy an inheritance principle for a similar reason as long as we consider a specific class of @xmath0 orbifolds . using the techniques of @xcite one can then obtain exact results in the large @xmath1 limit of any nonsupersymmetric gauge theory obtained as a orbifold of a supersymmetric one ; more specifically , one should be able to compute any quantity in the orbifold theory which is descended from a holomorphic quantity in the parent .",
    "in particular , we can determine the effect of additional adjoint matter in the parent theory on the formation of condensates and @xmath6 couplings in the daughter .",
    "this paper is a short description of how this works .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section [ orbifold - theories ]",
    "we review the notion of orbifold field theory . in section [ result ] we state our main result . in section [ diagrammatics ]",
    "we give some diagrammatic motivation for the conjecture .",
    "finally in section [ examples ] we sketch a few examples of theories for which we can make predictions using this technology .",
    "the field theories we will consider are obtained by a well - studied truncation procedure motivated from string theory @xcite .",
    "namely , begin with some four - dimensional `` parent '' @xmath7 gauge theory possessing a global symmetry @xmath8 . then consider a finite subgroup @xmath9 of @xmath10 , subject to the extra condition that the @xmath7 part of any nontrivial element in @xmath9 must be trace - free in the fundamental representation of @xmath7 . the truncated `` daughter '' theory",
    "is then defined simply by setting to zero all of the fundamental fields which are not @xmath9-invariant . when the parent theory has a string theory realization on a stack of d - branes , this procedure is equivalent to taking an orbifold of the string theory ; the trace - free condition corresponds to the requirement that none of the branes are stuck at fixed points .",
    "it is known that the planar diagrams of the daughter theory are numerically equal to the planar diagrams of the parent theory ( up to a rescaling of the gauge coupling ) ; this was shown first using string theory to organize the perturbation series @xcite and later this proof was rewritten strictly within field theory @xcite .",
    "so the two theories are the same at large @xmath1 , at least perturbatively in @xmath11 .",
    "in this paper we will focus on examples where the parent theory is @xmath5 supersymmetric and the daughter is non - supersymmetric .",
    "the simplest such example , also discussed in some detail in @xcite , is the case where the parent is @xmath5 , @xmath12 super yang - mills and @xmath13 , embedded into the @xmath6 r - symmetry and simultaneously acting by @xmath1 copies of the regular ( cyclic permutation ) representation of @xmath14 on the fundamental representation of @xmath12 . in this case",
    "the daughter theory has gauge group @xmath15 , and for each @xmath16 between @xmath17 and @xmath18 it has a massless weyl fermion transforming in the fundamental of @xmath19 and the antifundamental of @xmath20 ( with the convention @xmath21 ) .",
    "this matter content is summarized by the quiver diagram in figure [ circle - quiver ] .",
    "( throughout this paper all quiver diagrams are @xmath22 quivers ; nodes represent gauge groups and lines with arrows represent bifundamental weyl fermions or scalars . )",
    "sym after a @xmath14 truncation ( in the case @xmath23 . ) ]    we will consider only the case @xmath24 . pragmatically",
    "this restriction is motivated by our belief that bifermion condensates will give good variables with which to describe the infrared dynamics ; such a condensate can be gauge invariant only if @xmath24 .",
    "but actually there is another good reason to restrict attention to @xmath25 , namely , this is the only case in which the whole group @xmath14 preserves the vacuum of the parent theory ( recall that in @xmath5 , @xmath12 sym the r - symmetry is broken @xmath26 , first by an anomaly and then spontaneously by the choice of one of @xmath27 vacua . ) one would expect that the only effect of the truncation by elements which do not preserve the vacuum is to identify the different vacua , not to change the physics in a particular vacuum .",
    "so if @xmath18 is odd then none of the group elements affect the physics , and the theory should still be equivalent to @xmath5 sym ; if @xmath18 is even only the element of order @xmath28 affects the physics , so the theory should be equivalent to the @xmath0 quotient .",
    "indeed , at least if one is allowed to adjust the gauge couplings away from the orbifold point , this is known to be the case ; confinement and chiral symmetry breaking can reduce @xmath18 to @xmath29 repeatedly until one is left with either @xmath30 or @xmath25 in the infrared depending on whether one started with @xmath18 odd or even respectively @xcite .    so we will consider a @xmath0 truncation of an @xmath5 , @xmath31 gauge theory , with the nontrivial group element acting as @xmath32 where the matrix , acting on the gauge indices , is written in @xmath33 blocks .",
    "the matter content of the theory will include the truncation of the @xmath5 vector multiplet ; this yields two @xmath7 gauge fields @xmath34 , @xmath35 , with equal holomorphic gauge couplings , and two bifundamental fermions @xmath36 , @xmath37 as shown in figure [ simple - quiver ] .",
    "vector multiplet after the @xmath0 truncation by . ]",
    "if the parent theory has additional matter fields they will give rise to additional matter in the daughter theory ; this is the case in which the matrix model techniques of @xcite will be most useful .",
    "we are now ready to state our main results .",
    "we consider the @xmath0 quotient of @xmath5 , @xmath31 super yang - mills with additional adjoint matter and a superpotential with isolated classical solutions .",
    "to predict the nonperturbative effects of the daughter theory at large @xmath1 we will take our cue from the result of @xcite , which showed that the vacuum structure and holomorphic data of the parent can be calculated purely perturbatively .",
    "specifically , @xcite gave a general prescription for the infrared dynamics of the chiral superfield @xmath38 : namely , the effective superpotential is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is computed from the planar diagrams of a matrix model determined by the tree level superpotential of the parent theory , and @xmath41 is the holomorphic bare coupling .",
    "in component fields the superfield @xmath42 contains the gaugino condensate @xmath43 as well as the auxiliary field @xmath44 , which is essential for the reproduction of the chiral anomaly . integrating over the auxiliary field @xmath9 then gives the scalar potential @xmath45 .",
    "we propose that the daughter theory at large @xmath1 admits a similar infrared description .",
    "namely , the daughter has a possible bifermion condensate @xmath46 , obtained by truncating @xmath47 to its invariant constituents , and we can also write @xmath48 for the truncation of @xmath9 . then by strictly perturbative calculations reviewed in section [ diagrammatics ] one can see that the effective action for @xmath49 and @xmath48 contains terms which are naturally written @xmath50 for a function @xmath51 .",
    "furthermore , as we will show , @xmath52 is obtained directly from @xmath53 by matching up quantities in the parent and daughter theory .",
    "first , we should identify @xmath54 from perturbative calculations @xcite we also know that the free energies in parent and daughter can be equal only if one identifies @xmath55 , and we propose that the correct nonperturbative extension of this is @xmath56 finally , there is an inheritance principle @xmath57 substituting these in one finds @xmath58    of course , this @xmath51 does not admit a simple interpretation as a superpotential .",
    "nevertheless we propose that it continues to play the usual roles played by the superpotential  in particular , the vacua of the daughter theory at large @xmath1 are the critical points of @xmath51 , and domain wall tensions are given by differences of @xmath52 .",
    "( essentially this is equivalent to saying that , at least at large @xmath1 , the `` d - terms '' are sufficiently benign that @xmath48 can be treated as an auxiliary field and integrated out . )",
    "we can also give a formula for the diagonal @xmath6 couplings of the daughter theory , essentially @xmath59 , which will be discussed in more detail below .",
    "in this section we give the diagrammatic derivations of @xmath51 and @xmath60 . in the spirit of @xcite",
    "we will exploit the string theory representation of field theory diagrams as an organizing tool in our arguments ; however , all the arguments can be rephrased purely in terms of field theory a la @xcite .      the diagrams which contribute to the computation of @xmath61 in the parent @xmath5 theory are slightly different from the planar diagrams considered in @xcite .",
    "namely , those diagrams only had open string insertions along at most one boundary .",
    "they are the diagrams which have the leading @xmath1 dependence , and for such diagrams it is easy to see that , after the @xmath0 orbifolding , twisted sectors can not contribute to the path integral ; namely , any twisted sector will have a twist along at least one boundary without insertions , but then the chan - paton trace along that boundary gives zero .    on the other hand , to compute @xmath40 , according to @xcite one must insert two @xmath62 background fields along each of @xmath63 boundaries as pictured in figure [ w - diagram ] .    .",
    "]    we want to compare this diagram with its counterpart in the daughter theory . in the daughter theory the background fields we can turn on are",
    "more restricted since they must be invariant under @xmath0 .",
    "since the twist acts differently on the different components of @xmath64 , we should look at the diagram in terms of component fields ; then it has two @xmath65 insertions on @xmath66 boundaries , two @xmath67 insertions on one boundary , and no insertions on one boundary , as in figure [ w - diagram - components ] .",
    ", in superfield components . ]",
    "if there is a twist on the boundary with no insertions we get zero , because @xmath68 where @xmath69 what if there is a twist on a boundary with @xmath65 insertions ?",
    "since @xmath65 is fermionic and the twist includes a factor @xmath70 , for the background field @xmath65 to be invariant its chan - paton part ( which we also write @xmath65 ) must anticommute with @xmath71 .",
    "then the relevant trace in the twisted sector is @xmath72 where we used the cyclicity of the trace .",
    "so any sector with a twist either on the empty boundary or on one of the boundaries carrying @xmath65 insertions gives zero .",
    "the full value of the diagram is obtained by summing over all allowed combinations of twists ; there are @xmath73 of these , obtained by distributing the twists arbitrarily over the @xmath74 boundaries subject to the constraint that the total number of twists is even . from the above",
    "we then see that only the completely untwisted sector can contribute .",
    "furthermore there is an overall rescaling factor @xmath75 for the sum over @xmath73 twisted sectors .",
    "this factor we can interpret as giving @xmath76 for every boundary with an @xmath64 insertion ; hence in the daughter theory we have to set @xmath77 , at least in @xmath78 .    actually , we should make this replacement @xmath77 everywhere in @xmath53 .",
    "one way to see this is to observe that after this replacement @xmath79 becomes @xmath80 giving the correct chiral anomaly in the daughter theory ; another way is to note that the division between the logarithmic term and @xmath78 is unnatural from the viewpoint of the matrix model , in which the logarithm arises from the path integral measure .      if the gauge symmetry of the parent @xmath31 theory is unbroken and we have only adjoint fields , then in the parent the only @xmath6 factor is the overall @xmath6 which is decoupled . in the daughter @xmath81 theory",
    "there is a @xmath82 ; one combination of these is the trivial decoupled one , and as we will see below , the inheritance principle does not determine the coupling constant for the other combination .",
    "so to obtain an interesting result for the @xmath6 couplings we must consider a more general situation . indeed , for a general choice of @xmath5 parent theory we can consider a vacuum with the symmetry breaking pattern @xmath83 .",
    "choosing our @xmath0 quotient to respect this breaking , we will find daughter vacua with gauge group @xmath84 . in the infrared we will have confinement for the nonabelian factors , leaving behind @xmath85 .",
    "the matrix of effective @xmath6 couplings in the parent theory is obtained from diagrams which have two boundaries with one @xmath67 each , and @xmath66 boundaries with two @xmath65 each , as shown in figure [ tau - diagram ] .    .",
    "]    more explicitly , the rule is that for any background fields @xmath86 , the sum of these diagrams with the @xmath86 inserted gives @xmath87 .    as in the previous subsection , in the daughter theory",
    "the sectors with twists on the boundaries with @xmath65 insertions give zero . but depending on which components of @xmath67 we turn on , there may or may not be contributions from the sector with a twist on both ends of the cylinder ( in other words , the @xmath67 insertions can create both twisted and untwisted sector states in the closed string channel , as already observed in @xcite . )",
    "let us organize the @xmath88 @xmath6 field strengths of the daughter theory into @xmath89 , @xmath90 .",
    "the notation is explained by the fact that on boundaries with an @xmath91 inserted only the untwisted sector contributes , and on boundaries with an @xmath92 inserted only the twisted sector contributes .",
    "in the basis @xmath93 the @xmath6 couplings of the daughter theory are therefore @xmath94 where @xmath95 are the @xmath6 couplings in the parent theory , given by the untwisted sector diagrams and explicitly computable as in @xcite , while @xmath96 come from the corresponding twisted sector diagrams .",
    "hence it is only the diagonal @xmath97 for which the couplings are directly calculable from the inheritance principle .",
    "( one might have thought that the condition for avoiding contributions from twisted sectors would simply be @xmath98 , which would only exclude one of the @xmath88 @xmath6 couplings rather than @xmath99 of them ; this is wrong because in the vacuum with broken gauge symmetry the dependence on the chan - paton index is not just an overall factor @xmath100 . )",
    "the simplest case is the case where the parent is pure @xmath5 super yang - mills . in this case",
    "the parent simply has the veneziano - yankielowicz superpotential @xcite dictated by the one - loop axial anomaly , @xmath101 which on extremization gives the standard @xmath102 vacua determined by @xmath103 the daughter theory under the @xmath0 action is as pictured in figure [ simple - quiver ] , with all couplings equal ( @xmath104 , @xmath105 . )",
    "so in this case we have simply @xmath106 which on extremization gives @xmath1 vacua determined by @xmath107 or more explicitly , @xmath108 this result is consistent with the chiral anomaly of the daughter theory ; under a chiral rotation by @xmath109 , @xmath64 must rotate by @xmath110 , while @xmath111 shifts by @xmath112 .",
    "it is also consistent with the large @xmath1 rg flow , since at one loop the dynamical scale is @xmath113 and this one - loop result is exact at large @xmath1 , at least perturbatively in @xmath114 @xcite . put another way : independent of the way we constructed the daughter theory , its rg flow and chiral anomaly together imply that the condensate depends holomorphically on @xmath115 at large @xmath1 .",
    "this is a special feature of orbifolds of @xmath5 , not shared by generic @xmath116 gauge theories ; we believe it is only because of this holomorphicity that we have any chance of getting exact results .",
    "note that because @xmath117 there is an ambiguity of @xmath118 , rather than the usual @xmath119 , in our definition of @xmath120 .",
    "this ambiguity can shift @xmath64 by a factor @xmath121 and is related to the fact that the parent theory had @xmath102 vacua while the daughter only has @xmath1 .",
    "one can obtain more complicated examples by adding chiral superfields @xmath122 to the parent . with no superpotential",
    "this would give @xmath123 super yang - mills and a continuous moduli space ; we add a superpotential @xmath124 to break back down to @xmath125 and lift the moduli .",
    "the simplest possibility is to add just one adjoint superfield . for any choice of @xmath126",
    "these models have been exactly solved in @xcite , so the exact value of @xmath40 is known .",
    "then the matter content of the daughter theory looks like figure [ adjoint - quiver ] ,     sym with one adjoint chiral superfield after the @xmath0 truncation by . ]",
    "while the action is obtained by truncation of the parent lagrangian , giving @xmath127 a simple example is @xmath128 first note that in case @xmath129 , @xmath122 is simply decoupled and we recover pure @xmath5 sym .",
    "moreover , the result of @xcite allows us to integrate out @xmath122 and obtain the exact effective potential for @xmath64 even when @xmath130 is finite .",
    "then the formula for @xmath51 determines the vacua and domain wall tensions of the daughter theory .",
    "we can also consider examples where @xmath122 gets a vacuum expectation value .",
    "the simplest such is obtained by taking @xmath131 in this case both @xmath132 and @xmath133 will get vacuum expectation values .",
    "since @xmath134 , each of @xmath135 can separately distribute its @xmath1 eigenvalues between @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "however , the only vacua for which we expect to be able to make a prediction from the inheritance principle are the ones in which @xmath132 and @xmath133 distribute their eigenvalues equally , say each with @xmath138 eigenvalues equal to @xmath136 and @xmath139 eigenvalues equal to @xmath137 ( @xmath140 . ) these vacua descend from vacua with gauge symmetry @xmath141 in the parent theory , where we have made the @xmath0 quotient in a way compatible with the gauge symmetry breaking . substituting these vacuum expectation values for @xmath132 and @xmath133 in one obtains a theory with a complicated matter content shown in figure [ double - quiver ] .",
    "sym with one adjoint superfield and a superpotential @xmath142 , after the adjoint gets a vev .",
    "the gray lines represent massive fields . ]",
    "it describes two copies of the theory we considered in the first example ( figure [ simple - quiver ] ) , each with extra matter fields with masses of order @xmath143 .",
    "these two theories are then coupled to one another by scalars , fermions and w bosons all with masses of order @xmath136 .",
    "so now the effective description is in terms of two gluino condensates @xmath144 , @xmath145 , which are coupled to one another in @xmath146 ( with couplings suppressed by powers of @xmath136 . ) specifically , in the parent theory the superpotential is of the form @xmath147",
    "so in the daughter we predict @xmath148 we can also compute the couplings for the diagonals @xmath149 and @xmath150 , which descend from the parent theory as @xmath151",
