    "despite its wide relevance , the evolution of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) is still not very well understood .",
    "much of the problem stems from the fact that strong selection effects act on observed samples of cvs , making it difficult to constrain theory observationally .",
    "the angular momentum loss rate ( @xmath1 ) is the crucial ingredient of cv evolution theory .",
    "angular momentum loss leads to mass transfer from the secondary to the white dwarf .",
    "the relation between the mass transfer rate ( @xmath2 ) and @xmath3 depends on the structure of the secondary star , and the reaction of the secondary to mass loss determines the orbital period ( @xmath4 ) evolution of the system .",
    "population synthesis methods combine the changing @xmath2 and @xmath4 with a model of the birthrate of cvs to predict the present - day distribution of cvs as a function of @xmath5 , @xmath6 ( the mass of the white dwarf and secondary , respectively ) , @xmath2 , and @xmath4 .",
    "only one of these parameters , @xmath4 , can practically be measured for a large number of cvs ( but see @xcite for an indirect method to measure mass ratios ) .",
    "the orbital period distribution of known cvs is therefore one of the few observational properties of the cv population that can be used to constrain theory .",
    "the other obvious constraint is the observed cv space density .    in comparing both the size and period distribution of the known cv population to theoretical predictions",
    ", observational bias must be accounted for .",
    "this requires that observed cv samples be restricted to objects selected in well - defined ( and preferably homogeneous ) ways .",
    "a long - standing problem is that theory predicts a large population of short - period cvs , consisting mostly of period bouncers ( systems that have evolved beyond the period minimum at about 76  min ) , which is not observed .",
    "the models of @xcite and @xcite both predict that only @xmath7% of cvs are long - period systems , while roughly 70% are period bouncers .",
    "existing observations have already been used to argue that the short - period cv population can not be as large as predicted ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we will do the same here , using a new and independent cv sample .",
    "the cv samples that have been available to date are heavily biased against the intrinsically faint , short - period cvs , mainly because most have bright flux limits . the new sample considered here is also limited to apparently bright systems .",
    "however , almost all surveys incorporate a second selection cut ( most commonly a blue cut ) that also discriminates against the discovery of short - period cvs . the cv sample that we have constructed differs from most existing samples in that the only selection criterion ( other than a flux limit ) is based on line emission .",
    "the spectra of the majority of cvs show balmer emission lines , originating mainly in the accretion flow .",
    "the luminosity of cvs is anti - correlated to the equivalent widths ( ews ) of their emission lines ( @xcite ; @xcite ; we will take ews of emission lines as positive throughout ) .",
    "the explanation for this anti - correlation is that intrinsically faint cvs are low-@xmath2 systems with low density discs , in which recombination line cooling is very efficient .",
    "therefore , in contrast to other selection criteria ( such as blue optical colours and variability ) , an emission line ew - based selection cut should favour the discovery of intrinsically faint , short - period systems .    we have used the aao / ukst supercosmos h@xmath0 survey ( shs ) to define a homogeneous sample of cvs , selected on the basis of h@xmath0 emission .",
    "observations of the new cvs were presented in an earlier paper ( @xcite ; hereafter paper i ) . here",
    "we describe the construction and completeness of the sample , examine the observational biases affecting it , and compare it to the predictions of theory .",
    "the shs is a photographic survey carried out with the uk schmidt telescope @xcite .",
    "plates were scanned by the supercosmos digitizing machine , and the data are publicly available .",
    "the survey covered a total of @xmath8 ( 233 separate @xmath9 fields ) at low galactic latitude in the southern hemisphere ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) , in @xmath12 and narrow - band h@xmath0 .",
    "the limiting magnitude is @xmath13 , and the angular resolution of the images is @xmath14 .",
    "the digitized plates are processed to extract sources and provide image analysis mode ( iam ) data for the detected objects .",
    "the analysis assigns , amongst other parameters , classification , quality , and blend flags to each source .",
    "this makes it possible to obtain catalogues containing only well - isolated point sources with relatively good photometry .",
    "older ukst broad - band surveys , including an @xmath15-band survey of the whole southern sky , have also been scanned by supercosmos ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the photometric accuracy of these surveys is discussed in @xcite .",
    "the shs @xmath12 and h@xmath0 data are expected to be of similar quality , since the survey was digitized and processed in the same way . the photometry is calibrated to remove systematic errors in colour as a function of magnitude and position on a given plate ; this is described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the result is that errors in colours are typically smaller than would be expected from the errors in magnitudes . by matching the ukst catalogues to ccd data from the int / wfc photometric h@xmath0 survey of the northern galactic plane ( iphas ; see @xcite ) in regions near @xmath16 where the two surveys overlap , we made a rough estimate of errors in the shs colours .",
    "typical errors for stars brighter than @xmath17 are @xmath18 in @xmath19 and @xmath20 in @xmath21 , although these errors vary from field to field .    given the limited quality of photographic photometry , we do not expect any selection procedure to identify emission line objects in this survey with complete reliability .",
    "poor photometry is also not the only reason for the selection to fail . because h@xmath0 and corresponding @xmath12-band plates are in many cases taken months or even years apart , and all @xmath15-band images",
    "were obtained decades earlier , variable stars can erroneously be included in the sample .",
    "also , since m stars have strong molecular absorption bands in both the @xmath12 and @xmath15 pass - bands , they are another class of objects that can be selected , even if no emission lines appear in their spectra .",
    "multi - object spectroscopy has been used for the follow - up of objects from this survey ( e.g. @xcite ) , and has yielded low hit - rates for identifying emission line objects .",
    "we therefore chose selection criteria that are quite conservative , and that target only objects with large @xmath19 excess .",
    "sections of four of the shs fields in which cvs were identified .",
    "the solid lines are least - squares fits to all data points , while the dashed lines are vertically displaced by @xmath22 the rms scatter in @xmath19 around the best fits .",
    "only sources above the dashed lines are considered for selection .",
    "each panel is labeled with the name of the cv selected from the plot , and the colours of the cvs are plotted as circled points .",
    "the other points above the cut - off are plate defects ( crosses ) , objects that were not included in the sample , despite satisfying the cut - off ( filled circles ) , and an object that was observed but has no h@xmath0 emission ( triangle ) .",
    ", width=317 ]    our selection is aimed at bright objects that are clear outliers in the @xmath19 vs @xmath21 colour - colour plane .",
    "the selection procedure is similar to that of @xcite , but simpler ( we use only a single magnitude bin , and do not attempt to isolate an unreddened main sequence , since this sequence is typically not separately discernible in the shs photometry ) .",
    "we considered 175 out of the 233 fields ( i.e. @xmath23 in total ) .",
    "these fields were chosen to have relatively good photometry ( colour - colour diagrams of @xmath24 sections of fields were inspected , and in cases where one or more of these sections had a very poorly defined stellar locus , the whole field was discarded ) ; fields observed in the multi - object spectroscopy program of which some results are presented by @xcite were also avoided .",
    "we extracted catalogues covering @xmath9 around every of the 175 field centres , and restricted these catalogues to unblended point sources brighter than @xmath25 , and with good quality photometry in @xmath12 , h@xmath0 , and @xmath15 and h@xmath0 magnitudes are here denoted sr and r_ha , respectively ) .",

    "the meaning of the quality flags ( e.g. qual_sr ) is described by @xcite ; the flag class@xmath272 is assigned to objects classified as stellar . ] .    since the position of the stellar locus in the @xmath19 vs @xmath21 plane changes , even across a single @xmath9 field ( mainly because the effective photometric calibration is not constant ) ,",
    "each field was divided into 16 @xmath28 sub - fields , and these 1  sq.deg .",
    "sub - fields were used individually in selecting h@xmath0 excess sources .",
    "[ fig : selection_cc ] shows the @xmath19 excess as a function of @xmath21 colour of objects in four such sub - fields .",
    "the solid lines are linear fits to the colours of all objects ; note that the stellar locus has a positive slope in all these plots . the necessary , but not sufficient , criterion for selection is that targets have @xmath29 the rms scatter in @xmath19 around the best linear fit to the stellar locus .",
    "the dashed lines are vertically displaced by this amount from the best fits , and are the cut - off criteria for inclusion in the sample .    in fields where not all objects above the cut - off are cleanly separated from the stellar locus , some objects satisfying the cut - off are not selected .",
    "examples of such objects are plotted as filled circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : selection_cc ] .",
    "this amounts to subjectively excluding some potential targets , based on inspection of the colour - colour diagrams ( or , equivalently , using a stricter @xmath19 selection cut in some fields ) .    the colour - colour diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : selection_cc ] are for fields from which two new , and two previously known cv were selected .",
    "it illustrates that objects with fairly small @xmath19 can be selected if they are blue in @xmath21 ( e.g. dv sco ) , and also that , because of the non - zero slope of the stellar locus , a selection algorithm based only on @xmath19 will not successfully differentiate between true outliers and objects with red @xmath21 .    a selection based on abnormal colours ,",
    "not surprisingly , identifies a large number of objects with spurious photometry in one or more wave - band .",
    "therefore , we inspected the h@xmath0- , @xmath12- , and @xmath15-band images of all potential targets to exclude objects that are outliers because of , e.g. , plate defects ( some of the various kinds of plate defects that affect the data are illustrated in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "outliers that were excluded from the target list for this reason are plotted as crosses in fig .",
    "[ fig : selection_cc ] .",
    "next , we also excluded blends , objects from images that appear to have been taken in particularly poor seeing , and a few objects in areas with very high h@xmath0 background . less than 30% of potential targets survive these quality cuts .    with the exception of objects that are known only as x - ray sources",
    ", the targets that could be matched to known objects in the simbad astronomical database were also excluded .",
    "the known objects included planetary nebulae , t tauri stars , cvs , and several other types of variable stars .",
    "the selection produced 507 targets , and we obtained identification spectra for 460 of them ( no additional criteria were applied to choose these 460 objects ; we simply observed as many targets as time allowed for ) .",
    "172 of the observed targets really are h@xmath0 emission line objects ( a hit - rate of only 37% ) , and 14 ( that is 3% ) are cvs . of the 288 targets with no h@xmath0 emission , 10 are m stars ( we also found many m stars with h@xmath0 emission ) .",
    "some combination of poor survey photometry and variability ( probably in most cases continuum , rather than emission line variability ) led to the selection of the remaining 278 targets found to have no h@xmath0 emission .",
    "errors in these colours are shown in the top left hand corner .",
    "several objects lie outside the @xmath21 and @xmath19 ranges plotted .",

    ", width=317 ]    fig .",
    "[ fig : allcolcol ] shows @xmath19 excess as a function of @xmath21 colour for all the objects we observed .",
    "the colours of cvs are plotted as crosses ; other emission line objects are shown as open square points , and objects without h@xmath0 emission are plotted as grey triangles .",
    "note that some of the objects without h@xmath0 emission have very large @xmath19 , and that the cvs are systematically bluer in @xmath21 than the overall target sample .",
    "we also investigated other optical colours , as well as near - ir colours of the targets . while it is possible to separate the majority of late type emission line stars from cvs using e.g. two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; @xcite ) photometry , be stars and other early type emission line stars , as well as the objects without any line emission ( our most important contaminant ) , occupy the same regions as most cvs in all the colour - colour and colour - magnitude planes .",
    "it will therefore not be easy to construct a much more efficient selection procedure to find cvs in this survey .    in paper",
    "i we included two cvs fainter than @xmath17 .",
    "these were discovered during an observing run for which we experimented with selecting objects in a fainter magnitude bin .",
    "we will here consider only cvs from the @xmath30 selection .",
    "the fraction of known cvs recovered by our selection gives an indication of the completeness of the cv sample .",
    "there are 42 previously known cvs with @xmath30 in the survey area covered by our follow - up , and only 7 of these were selected as targets .",
    "the majority of the cvs that were not selected ( 30 systems ) were excluded by the cuts in the class , quality , and blend iam parameters . of the other 5 that were missed ,",
    "one was excluded because it is blended ( despite being classified as a single point source in the shs ) , and two did not satisfy the @xmath19 vs @xmath21 cut - off criterion .",
    "the remaining two cvs that were not recovered had colours above , but very close to the selection cut .    with 7 recovered systems , and 14 new cvs , we know that our completeness is no better than @xmath31 , or 38% .",
    "since we observed 460 out of 507 targets , the efficiency of selecting previously known cvs is @xmath32 .",
    "i.e. , we expect to select roughly 15% of all cvs at @xmath30 , if known cvs occupy the same general part of the @xmath19 vs @xmath21 plane as the intrinsic cv population .",
    "[ fig : per_mag_ri_hist ] shows the @xmath12 , @xmath4 , and @xmath21 distributions of cvs with @xmath30 in the survey area considered , highlighting the previously known cvs chosen as targets by the selection .",
    "although the cv recovery rate is low , a more important concern is magnitude- or period - dependent bias in the recovery rate ( as that would almost certainly imply the same bias for the overall cv sample ) .",
    "it is important in this regard that a large fraction of cvs known to have been missed by our selection ( 30 out of 35 ) were excluded by the restrictions on iam parameters , which are expected to be mostly insensitive to colour and apparent magnitude .",
    "the magnitude distributions of both the selected cv sample and the recovered cvs appear to indicate that , up to @xmath17 , our survey is not affected by an apparent magnitude bias .",
    "this is illustrated both by the steep rise towards fainter magnitudes in the @xmath12 distribution ( left hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : per_mag_ri_hist ] ) , and by the fact that we do not recover relatively more bright cvs ( the same fraction of previously known cvs are recovered in the magnitude bins @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 ) .",
    "this is not surprising ; see , e.g. , @xcite . ] .",
    "the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : per_mag_ri_hist ] also shows clearly that a larger fraction of known cvs are recovered at short periods than at long periods .",
    "it is therefore tempting to conclude that , as expected from the fact that short - period cvs have stronger emission lines , any period bias in the selection favours the inclusion of short - period cvs .    the right hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : per_mag_ri_hist ] shows the distribution of cvs in @xmath21 .",
    "the distribution of the sample of previously known cvs has a standard deviation of 1.0 .",
    "this large spread in @xmath21 is not physical  it results from poor photometry and variability between the @xmath12 and @xmath15 epochs .",
    "the cvs included in our sample are on average bluer than the previously known cvs .",
    "this bias in @xmath21 is not as strong as it appears at first sight .",
    "we will not consider cvs at very long periods , because they are likely to contain evolved secondary stars .",
    "seven systems in the sample of previously known cvs have periods greater than 8  h , and 5 of these have @xmath21 colours between 0.36 and 0.70 , i.e. in the two maximum bins of the @xmath21 distribution . with",
    "these 7 objects excluded , the probability that the @xmath21 distributions of the selected and previously known cvs are drawn from the same population is 0.54 , according to a kolmogorov - smirnov test .",
    "therefore , we have no good evidence for a blue bias in @xmath21 from this comparison .",
    "however , the samples used for this comparison are both quite small , and the positive slope of the stellar locus in the @xmath19 vs @xmath21 plane , which causes the selection to be more sensitive to objects with relatively small @xmath36 at bluer @xmath21 , implies that such a bias may be expected . the implications that this may have for @xmath4- or @xmath12-dependent biases will be further discussed in section  [ sec : bias ] .",

    "the model histograms are scaled as described in section [ sec : rho ] below .",
    "the above modelling accounts for the effects of the magnitude limit , and the restriction of the survey to the galactic plane . with only those selection effects included , the predicted period distribution is inconsistent with the observations ( relatively too many short - period cvs are predicted ) .",
    "however , we need to determine whether the remaining selection effects present in our sample could reconcile the predicted and observed distributions .",
    "we therefore make conservative assumptions about the influence of these biases ( i.e. assumptions that decrease the predicted ratio of short- to long - period cvs ) .      the dependence of selection probability on @xmath36 is not included in our model .",
    "this is because the disc model predicts ews that are clearly too small ( as demonstrated for h@xmath51 by @xcite ; this is also true for h@xmath0 ) .",
    "the alternative of using an empirical relation is not available , because the dependence of @xmath36 on , e.g. , @xmath52 is not known .",
    "one may expect that including this selection cut in the model would increase the predicted ratio of short- to long - period cvs , and therefore that not accounting for it is a conservative assumption .",
    "whether an object is selected as a target depends on its @xmath19 and @xmath21 colours .",
    "the @xmath21 dependence arises from the non - zero slope of the stellar locus in the @xmath19 vs @xmath21 plane .",
    "it is also likely that the selection probability depends on @xmath12 magnitude , since the photometric uncertainty increases at fainter magnitudes .",
    "while our cv sample does not at first sight appear to be increasingly incomplete at fainter @xmath12 , the sample of all emission line objects from our follow - up certainly is magnitude biased , with an @xmath12 distribution that flattens off at around @xmath53 .",
    "the reason that the cv sample is not affected by the same magnitude bias as the overall emission line sample is not because cvs have systematically stronger emission lines than other types of emission line objects selected for follow - up , but because the cvs are on average bluer in @xmath21 . our selection is sensitive to faint objects with small ews only if those objects are sufficiently blue in @xmath21 .",
    "redder faint objects must have stronger lines in order to be selected .    to the extent that data can guide us , the resulting blue bias does not matter  intrinsically fainter , redder cvs have stronger lines .",
    "this is well established for normal short - period cvs , but observational information on period bouncers is scarce .",
    "there are now two confirmed period bouncers , sdss j103533.03 + 055158.4 , and sdss j150722.30 + 523039.8 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; patterson , thorstensen & knigge ( in preparation ) ) and they have @xmath54 and @xmath55 , and kron - cousins @xmath21 of @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively ( @xcite ; @xcite ; colour transformations from @xcite ) .",
    "our selection is easily capable of identifying objects with these ews and colours near @xmath17 .    in the absence of an undetected population of faint ,",
    "red cvs with weak emission lines , our ew cut thus preferentially excludes intrinsically bright ( i.e. long - period ) cvs .",
    "dne in outburst probably have smaller ew(h@xmath0 ) as a rule ( this is certainly true for h@xmath51 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this means that an outbursting dn is less likely to be identified in an h@xmath0 survey than a quiescent system .",
    "the problem here is slightly more complicated than whether a system has sufficiently large ew(h@xmath0 ) at a single epoch , since observations in the three wavebands used in the selection were not taken simultaneously .",
    "variability between the epochs of the @xmath12 , @xmath15 , and h@xmath0 observations can lead both to an object with h@xmath0 emission not being selected , and to an object without h@xmath0 emission being included .",
    "the most common large amplitude variability displayed by cvs is dn outbursts , and we will consider only this type of variability . out of the 175 fields we used in the selection , 72 were observed in @xmath12 and h@xmath0 on the same night ; all @xmath15-band data were taken roughly 20 years earlier .    a system that is bright in both @xmath12 and h@xmath0 but faint in @xmath15",
    "will probably be selected , because it will be very blue in @xmath21 ( v383 vel is an example  it was observed in outburst in @xmath12 and h@xmath0 on the same night , but was faint during the @xmath15 epoch ) .",
    "cvs are likely to be missed by the selection because of variability if they are bright in @xmath12 and faint in h@xmath0 , or bright only in @xmath15 .",
    "we assume that the probability of a long - period system being excluded for reasons of variability is 0 , and that the probability of a short - period system being excluded for being bright in @xmath12 , is @xmath48 .",
    "then , to allow for the possibility of a dn being bright in @xmath15 , we do the same with the remaining short - period dne ( i.e. we exclude a fraction of systems equal to the particular outburst duty cycle ) .",
    "after applying the cuts involving @xmath12 , @xmath58 , and variability described above , the sample is predicted to contain 13% period bouncers ( i.e. about 2 systems in our sample of 17 ) , whereas none are detected .",
    "this is not a serious discrepancy .",
    "the predicted fraction of long - period cvs is 30% .",
    "if we assume that our combined ew and @xmath21 cut makes it impossible to detect period bouncers , then 34% of the sample is predicted to be long - period systems . using the binomial distribution ,",
    "the probability that the observed ratio of at least @xmath59 is consistent with this prediction is 0.031 .",
    "the model is therefore inconsistent with observations at more than 2-@xmath60 .",
    "the inconsistency would be a 3-@xmath60 result if two more systems in our sample had periods above the period gap .",
    "it is likely that this will prove to be the case .",
    "the spectrum of h@xmath0190039 is characteristic of an intrinsically bright cv , and there is reason to suspect that h@xmath0075648 is an sw sex star .",
    "our sample is not suitable for measuring the cv space density ( @xmath61 ) , but we can verify that it is in reasonable agreement with a specific prediction .",
    "@xcite and @xcite theoretically predict @xmath62 ( but see also @xcite , for a theoretical value significantly lower ) , with a hundredth of all cvs above the period gap . the space density of long - period cvs ( @xmath63 )",
    "is then predicted to be @xmath64 .",
    "setting @xmath65 in the simulation , we predict ( with the area coverage and flux limit of our survey ) that about 22 long - period cvs should be detected if the sample really is 15% complete .",
    "this assumes that the only selection cut affecting long - period cvs is the magnitude limit and @xmath58 restriction .",
    "our sample contains at least 10 long - period cvs , perhaps as many as 14 .",
    "the total number of observed long - period cvs is then consistent with the prediction if the true completeness for long - period systems is @xmath66% .",
    "this is entirely reasonable , but given the uncertain completeness , it is not a very secure result are @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . ] .    the predicted @xmath12 and @xmath4 histograms in fig .",
    "[ fig : model_obs_per_mag ] were scaled to reflect the number of cvs that should have been detected in our survey ( 2800  sq.deg . , @xmath69 , and @xmath30 ) if @xmath70 , and if the survey is 8% complete , with no dependence of completeness on @xmath4 .",
    "it is usually assumed that the theoretical ratio of the number of short- to long - period cvs is larger than observed because theory predicts too large a population of short - period cvs .",
    "several solutions to this problem have been proposed .",
    "we will consider here the suggestion that there is an angular momentum loss mechanism that increases the absolute value of @xmath3 of short - period cvs above that of the rate resulting from gravitational radiation ( @xmath71 ) ; see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite .",
    "higher @xmath1 below the period gap decreases the evolutionary time - scale of short - period cvs and therefore reduces the total number of cvs in this evolutionary phase could predict the position of the period minimum correctly , and would fit the observed relation between @xmath72 and @xmath4 better than models assuming only gravitational radiation . ] .",
    "the evolutionary time - scale of a cv is @xmath73 where the angle brackets denote the secular average . assuming that all cvs form at periods longer than @xmath74  h , and only evolve through the period ranges that we consider , the number of cvs that exist in some particular period interval is proportional to the time cvs spend in that interval .",
    "the ratio of the numbers of long- and short - period cvs is therefore proportional to the ratio of their evolutionary times - scales ( @xmath75 and @xmath76 for long- and short - period cvs , respectively ) .",
    "the ratio of long- to short - period cvs observed in a survey for which the most important bias is a flux limit , can be written as @xmath77 here , @xmath78 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath79 , since apparent brightness depends on accretion luminosity , which in turn scales inversely with @xmath80 .",
    "the form of @xmath81 means that , by comparing the observed and predicted number ratios , we can set a limit on the true ratio of evolutionary time - scales of cvs above and below the period gap .",
    "using equation  [ eq : rat1 ] , we can write this ratio as @xmath82 \\left [ \\frac{\\left(n_l / n_s\\right)_{obs}}{\\left(n_l / n_s\\right)_{pred } } \\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath83 is the predicted ratio of the evolutionary time - scale of long - period cvs to the evolutionary time - scale short - period cvs .",
    "if @xmath84 , as in our case , we must clearly have @xmath85 .",
    "the monotonic nature of @xmath81 then implies that @xmath86 , so that @xmath87.\\ ] ] physically , this inequality holds because any adjustment to the predicted evolutionary time - scales that causes the short - period phase to be shorter relative to the long - period phase will also make short - period cvs brighter relative to long - period systems ( and therefore less under - represented in a flux - limited sample . ] ) .",
    "the impact of such a time - scale adjustment on the observed number ratio is therefore always smaller than on the intrinsic number ratio .    to be more specific , we can assume @xmath88 .",
    "then , for this survey , with @xmath89 and @xmath90 , the model evolutionary time - scale of short - period cvs must be decreased by @xmath91 to match the observations . or , equivalently , we require @xmath92 for short - period cvs , in order to bring theory and observations into agreement .",
    "this factor of at least 3 would be an under estimate if the ew - based selection cut discriminates strongly against long - period cvs .",
    "despite the very conservative assumptions outlined in section  [ sec : bias ] , the model cv population and the observed sample do not agree .",
    "we have thus confirmed the result of @xcite with an independent observational sample .",
    "standard cv evolution theory predicts too large a ratio of short- to long - period cvs .",
    "this is true even if we assume that period bouncers are undetectable .",
    "the favoured explanation for the large predicted ratio of short- to long - period cvs is that short - period systems evolve faster than predicted by the disrupted magnetic braking model , so that the predicted population of short - period cvs is too large ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . using the h@xmath0 sample , we find that the evolutionary time - scale of short - period cvs in our model should be decreased by a factor of at least 3 in order for the model to agree with observations ( if the predicted evolutionary time - scale of long - period cvs is correct ) .    for the palomar - green ( pg ) survey cv sample ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , @xcite found @xmath93 , compared to an observed ratio of @xmath94 . with the same reasoning as in section  [ sec : tau ] above , this implies that the evolutionary time - scale of short - period cvs in the model is too long by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "this is surprisingly large , especially when compared to the result of @xcite , who finds that @xmath95 for short - period cvs provides a satisfactory fit to his data .",
    "this may be a hint that the assumption @xmath88 is wrong .",
    "the observational constraints on the size of the long - period cv population and @xmath2 above the period gap are not sufficiently precise to answer this question definitively , but it certainly has been suggested that the @xcite magnetic braking law used in the model is too strong ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "our model may therefore not only predict too many short - period cvs , but also too few long - period cvs .    in this regard , it is also worth noting that recent estimates of @xmath2 in a small sample of short - period cvs are consistent with the values expected from angular momentum loss through gravitational radiation ( @xcite ; littlefair , et al .",
    "( in preparation ) ) .",
    "@xcite have also estimated @xmath2 for sdss j150722.30 + 523039.8 , but they find that this system probably has an unusual evolutionary history ( see also patterson , thorstensen & knigge ( in preparation ) ) .    before an h@xmath0-selected cv sample can be used to place tighter constraints on cv evolution , @xmath36 must be modelled in terms of the parameters describing cvs in a theoretical population .",
    "it is known that the ews of disc emission lines increase with decreasing luminosity .",
    "however , cv discs are observed together with a white dwarf primary .",
    "very faint systems are white dwarf dominated ( i.e. , the continuum emission from the disc is low relative to that from the white dwarf ) .",
    "also , the disc emission lines are superimposed on the absorption lines of the white dwarf .",
    "therefore , at faint luminosity , the relation between ew and @xmath52 is expected to flatten off ( @xcite plots @xmath96 vs the absolute magnitude of the disc alone ; his relation therefore does not show this effect ) .",
    "this is observationally clear from the spectra of the faintest known cvs , and has already been remarked on by @xcite . although the decrease in @xmath36 is expected to be less severe than that in @xmath96 , this might ultimately place a limit on what can be achieved by an emission line survey .",
    "the comparison of this h@xmath0-selected cv sample to theory is also complicated by the possibility of variability between non - simultaneous observations in the three wave - bands used for the selection .",
    "surveys such as iphas will overcome this difficulty .",
    "iphas will also provide much better photometric accuracy than can be achieved photographically , so that the photometry will allow for the identification of objects with smaller ews in all parts of the colour - colour plane ; any blue bias will therefore be weaker ( see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the emission line samples constructed from iphas data will be much deeper .",
    "this is very important , since a selection technique capable of identifying intrinsically faint cvs is of limited value in a survey with a bright flux limit .",
    "the main challenge for iphas will be the amount of observational effort needed to finish the identification and follow - up of the cv sample .",
    "the same is true for other large , deep surveys  the completion of the resulting new cv samples are still some time in the future .    with the smaller cv samples available at the moment",
    ", it is already possible to recognize the qualitative changes that are needed to reconcile theory with observations .",
    "we have compared a homogeneous cv sample , selected for h@xmath0 emission , to a model cv population based on standard cv evolution theory .",
    "the magnitude limit and galactic latitude range of the observed sample was modelled in some detail , while conservative assumptions were made to account for the effects of variability and the @xmath36-based selection cut .",
    "the model population is inconsistent with the observed sample .",
    "specifically , the model predicts relatively too many short - period cvs .",
    "this confirms earlier results , based on independent observations .",
    "the reason for the mismatch between the predicted and observed ratio of short- to long - period cvs may be that the theoretical evolutionary time - scale for cvs below the period gap is too long .",
    "a ( very simplistic ) consideration of the relative numbers of long- and short - period cvs included in the sample indicates that the disrupted magnetic braking model underestimates @xmath1 of short - period cvs by a factor of at least 3 , assuming that the model is correct for long - period cvs .",
    "although surveys now in progress will in future provide much better observational constraints on cv evolution theory than can be derived at the moment , it is already clear that the standard magnetic braking model is in need of revision . furthermore , it seems that the correct approach to take is to investigate angular momentum loss rates in excess of the gravitational radiation rate in cvs below the period gap .",
