    "galaxies , in their detailed properties , carry the imprints of their surroundings , with a strong dependence of the quiescent fraction of galaxies on their local environment ( e.g. @xcite ; for a recent review see @xcite ) . the strength of this dependence is itself a strongly decreasing function of galaxy stellar mass ; at the extreme , the lowest mass ( @xmath13 @xmath14 ) galaxies end their star formation only in dense regions , and never in isolation ( @xcite ) . these effects also vary with redshift at least in the densest clusters , as observed in the changing fraction of late - type spirals relative to the field , found in studies of the morphology - density relation ( @xcite ) .",
    "clearly understanding the properties of galaxies in the present - day universe requires a careful investigation of the role of environment , and how that role changes over time .",
    "nevertheless , the evolution of the role of environment is a relatively subtle effect and must be interpreted within the context of the evolving galaxy population .",
    "for instance , the most dramatic change in galaxy properties during the past eight billion years has been the remarkable decline in the star - formation rate of galaxies in the universe ( @xcite ) .",
    "this decline appears dominated by decreases in the rates of star - formation of individual galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "there is evidence that a large fraction of the decline is associated with strongly infrared - emitting starbursts ( @xcite ) . as @xcite and",
    "others have pointed out , because the environmental dependence of total star - formation rates at fixed redshift is relatively small , environmental effects are unlikely to cause the overall star - formation rate decline .    during this period ,",
    "the major classes of galaxies that we observe today have already been firmly in place ( @xcite ) .",
    "though not as dramatic as the history of galaxies prior to @xmath15 , detailed observations of the stellar mass function find significant evolution of the galaxy population with the decline in the number density of massive star - forming galaxies accompanied by an increase in the number density of quiescent galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite , for instance , find that since @xmath16 the @xmath17 decline in the number density of massive star - forming galaxies ( @xmath18 ) is complemented by the rise in number density of intermediate - mass quiescent galaxies ( @xmath19 ) , by a factor of @xmath20 , and massive quiescent galaxies ( @xmath18 ) , by @xmath21 . on the color - magnitude diagram",
    ", this corresponds to the doubling of the red sequence over this period ( @xcite ) .",
    "these changes in galaxy population are likely a result of physical processes that cause the cessation of star - formation in star - forming galaxies .    of the numerous mechanisms that have been proposed to explain this cessation ,",
    "favored models suggest that internal processes such as supernovae or active galactic nuclei heat the gas within the galaxy , which consequently suppresses the cold gas supply used for star - formation ( @xcite ) .",
    "other models propose that environment dependent external processes such as ram - pressure stripping ( @xcite ) , strangulation ( @xcite ) , or harassment ( @xcite ) contribute to the cessation .",
    "observations such as @xcite and @xcite credit some of these proposed internal processes for the cessation of star - formation , especially in massive galaxies .",
    "meanwhile , observations of galaxy properties such as color and morphology correlating with environment suggest that environment may play a role in ceasing star - formation ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , it remains to be determined whether the environmental trends in galaxy properties reflect the direct effect of external environment on the galaxies evolution ( e.g. ram pressure , tidal forces , mergers ) or reflect statistical differences in the histories of galaxies in different environments ( e.g. an earlier formation time in dense regions ) .",
    "in this paper we take the most straightforward investigation by directly determining the star - forming properties of galaxies as a function of environment , stellar mass and redshift in a single , consistently analyzed data set .",
    "this analysis can reveal how galaxies end their star formation over time , quantitatively establish the contribution of environmental effects to the overall trends , and reveal whether those trends happen equally in all environments .",
    "however , such an analysis has not been done previously due to the lack of sufficiently large samples . in this paper",
    ", we apply this approach using the priism multi - object survey ( primus ; @xcite , @xcite ) , the largest available redshift survey covering the epochs between @xmath22 .",
    "in section [ sec : sample ] we present a brief description of the primus and sdss data , our mass complete sample construction , and galaxy environment measurements . after dividing our galaxy sample into subsamples of star - forming or quiescent and high or low density environments ,",
    "we compute and examine the evolution of the stellar mass functions for our subsamples in section [ sec : smf ] . in section",
    "[ sec : qf_const ] , we calculate the quiescent fraction , analyze the evolution of the quiescent fraction , quantify the effects of environment on the quiescent fraction evolution , and discuss the implications of our quiescent fraction results on the cessation of star - formation in galaxies . finally in section",
    "[ sec : summary ] we summarize our results .    throughout the paper",
    "we assume a cosmology with @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "all magnitudes are ab - relative .",
    "we are interested in quantifying the effects of galaxy environment on the evolution of the quiescent fraction over the redshift range @xmath25 . for our analysis",
    ", we require a sample with sufficient depth and high quality spectroscopic redshift to probe the redshift range and to robustly measure galaxy environment .",
    "primus with its @xmath26 spectroscopic redshifts provides a large data set at intermediate redshifts for our analysis .",
    "in addition , we anchor our analysis with a low redshift sample derived from the sloan digital sky survey ( @xcite ) .    in section [ sec : primus ] and section [",
    "sec : sdss ] we provide a brief summary of the primus and sdss data used for our sample selection . in section [ sec : target ] we define our stellar mass complete galaxy sample .",
    "then , in section [ sec : sfq ] , we classify the sample galaxies as quiescent or star - forming .",
    "we calculate the environment using a volume - limited environment defining population in section [ sec : environment ] .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : edgeeffect ] , we account for edge effects in the surveys .          at intermediate redshifts",
    "we use multiwavelength imaging and spectroscopic redshifts from primus , a faint galaxy survey with @xmath27 redshifts ( @xmath28 ) within the range @xmath29 .",
    "the survey was conducted using the imacs spectrograph on the magellan i baade @xmath30-m telescope with a slitmask and low dispersion prism . for details on the primus observation methods such as survey design , targeting , and data summary , we refer readers to the survey papers ( @xcite ) .",
    "while the primus survey targeted seven distinct extragalactic deep fields for a total of @xmath31 , we restrict our sample to five fields that have @xmath32 and _ spitzer_/irac imaging for a total of @xmath33 ( similar to the sample selection in @xcite ) .",
    "four of these fields are a part of the _ spitzer _ wide - area infrared extragalactic survey ( swire ) : the european large area iso survey - south @xmath34 field ( elais - s1 ) , the chandra deep field south swire field ( cdfs ) , and the xmm large scale structure survey field ( xmm - lss ) .",
    "the xmm - lss consists of two separate but spatially adjacent fields : the subaru / xmm - newton deep survey field ( xmm - sxdss ) and the canadian - france - hawaii telescope legacy survey field ( xmm - cfhtls ) .",
    "our fifth and final field is the cosmic evolution survey ( cosmos ) field .",
    "for all of our fields we have near - uv ( nuv ) and far - uv ( fuv ) photometry from the _ galex _ deep imaging survey ( dis ; @xcite ) as well as ground - based optical and _ spitzer_/irac mid - infrared photometric catalogs .",
    "@xcite provides detailed descriptions of integrated flux calculations in the photometric bands for each of our fields .",
    "furthermore , we derive the _ k - corrections _ from the photometry using ` k - correct ` ( v4.2 ; @xcite ) .    finally , using the spectroscopic redshift and broad wavelength photometry we apply ` isedfit ` , a bayesian sed modeling code , to calculate stellar masses and star formation rates ( sfrs ) for our sample galaxies ( @xcite ) . `",
    "isedfit ` uses the redshift and the observed photometry of the galaxies to determine the statistical likelihood of a large ensemble of generated model seds .",
    "the model seds are generated using flexible stellar population synthesis ( fsps ) models ( @xcite ) based on the @xcite imf , along with other prior parameters discussed in section 4.1 and appendix a of @xcite .",
    "for the observed photometry , we use the _ galex _ fuv and nuv , the two shortest irac bands at @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( the two longer - wavelength irac channels are excluded because ` isedfit ` does not model hot dust or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons emission lines ) , and the optical bands .      at low redshifts ,",
    "we use spectroscopic redshifts and @xmath37 photometry from the sdss data release 7 ( dr7 ; @xcite ) .",
    "more specifically we select galaxies from the new york university value - added galaxy catalog ( hereafter vagc ) that satisfy the main sample criterion and have galaxy extinction corrected petrosian magnitudes @xmath38 and spectroscopic redshifts within @xmath39 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we further restrict the vagc sample to only galaxies with medium depth observations with total exposure time greater than @xmath40 from _ galex _ release 6 .",
    "this leaves @xmath41 galaxies .",
    "next , we use the mast / casjobs interface and a @xmath42 diameter search radius , to obtain the nuv and fuv photometry for the sdss-_galex _ galaxies . for optical photometry",
    ", we use the @xmath37 bands from the sdss ` model ` magnitudes scaled to the @xmath43-band ` cmodel ` magnitude .",
    "these photometric bands are then supplemented with integrated @xmath44 magnitudes from the 2mass extended source catalog ( xsc ; @xcite ) and with photometry at @xmath45 and @xmath46 from the wise all - sky data release .",
    "further details regarding the sdss-_galex _ sample photometry can be found in section 2.4 of @xcite . as previously done on the primus data in section [ sec : primus ] , we use ` isedfit ` to obtain the stellar masses and star formation rates for the sdss-_galex _ sample .    the sdss-_galex _ data discussed above is derived from the nyu - vagc based on sdss data release 7 , using the standard sdss photometric measurements .",
    "several investigators have found that the background subtraction techniques used in the standard photometric catalogs introduce a size dependent bias in the galaxy fluxes and consequently stellar masses ( @xcite ) .    in order to quantify the effects of these photometric underestimations in our analysis , we tried replacing our sdss fluxes in the @xmath37 band with @xmath37 fluxes from the nasa - sloan atlas ( nsa ) catalog , which incorporate the improved background subtraction presented in @xcite and uses single - seric fit fluxes rather than the standard sdss ` cmodel ` fluxes . using the ratio of the luminosity derived from the improved photometry over the luminosity derived from the standard nyu - vagc photometry",
    ", we apply a preliminary correction to the stellar mass values obtained from ` isedfit ` assuming a consistent mass - to - light ratio .",
    "this mass correction leads to a significant increase in the stellar mass function for @xmath47 ; however , the effect of the mass correction was negligible for the quiescent fraction evolution results . as a result , for the results presented here we use the standard sdss fluxes and we do not discuss the issues with photometric measurements any further in this paper . we note that a thorough investigation of these issues to understand their effect on the stellar mass function requires a reanalysis of both the sdss photometry and the deeper photometry used for primus targeting .",

    "_ and intermediate redshift primus data we define our mass complete galaxy sample .",
    "we begin by imposing the parent sample selection criteria from @xcite .",
    "more specifically , we take the statistically complete _ primary _ sample from the primus data ( @xcite ) and impose magnitude limits on optical selection bands as specified in @xcite table 1 .",
    "these limits are in different optical selection bands and have distinct values for the five primus target fields .",
    "we then exclude stars and broad - line agn to only select objects spectroscopically classified as galaxies , with high - quality spectroscopic redshifts ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "lastly , we impose a redshift range of @xmath72 for the primus galaxy sample , where @xmath73 is selected due to limitations from sample variance and @xmath74 is selected due to the lack of sufficient statistics in subsamples defined below .    for the primus objects that meet the above criteria , we assign statistical weights ( described in @xcite and @xcite ) in order to correct for targeting incompleteness and redshift failures .",
    "the statistical weight , @xmath75 , for each galaxy is given by @xmath76 as in equation ( 1 ) in @xcite .",
    "since we are ultimately interested in a mass complete galaxy sample to derive smfs and qfs , next we impose stellar mass completeness limits to our galaxy sample .",
    "stellar mass completeness limits for a magnitude - limited survey such as primus are functions of redshift , the apparent magnitude limit of the survey , and the typical stellar mass - to - light ratio of galaxies near the flux limit .",
    "we use the same procedure as @xcite , which follows @xcite , to empircally determine the stellar mass completeness limits . for each of the target galaxies",
    "we compute @xmath70 using @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the stellar mass of the galaxy in @xmath79 , @xmath70 is the stellar mass of each galaxy if its magnitude was equal to the survey magnitude limit , @xmath80 is the observed apparent magnitude in the selection band , and @xmath81 is the magnitude limit for our five fields . we construct a cumulative distribution of @xmath70 for the @xmath11 faintest galaxies in @xmath82 bins . in each of these redshift bins ,",
    "we calculate the minimum stellar mass that includes @xmath83 of the galaxies . separately for quiescent and star - forming galaxies , we fit quadratic polynomials to the minimum stellar masses versus redshift ( star - forming or quiescent classification is described in the following section ) .",
    "finally , we use the polynomials to obtain the minimum stellar masses at the center of redshift bins , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 , which are then used as primus stellar mass completeness limits .    for the low redshift portion of our galaxy sample , we start by limiting the sdss-_galex _ data to objects within @xmath49 , a redshift range later imposed on the volume - limited environment defining population ( section [ sec : environment ] ) . to account for the targeting incompleteness of the sdss-_galex _ sample , we use the statistical weight estimates provided by the nyu - vagc catalog . furthermore , we determine a uniform stellar mass completeness limit of @xmath51 above the stellar mass - to - light ratio completeness limit of the sdss-_galex _ data within the imposed redshift limits ( @xcite ) .",
    "we then apply this mass limit in order to obtain our mass - complete galaxy sample at low redshift .",
    "we now have a stellar mass complete sample derived from sdss- _ galex _ and primus data .",
    "since our sample is derived from two different surveys , we account for the disparity in the redshift uncertainty .",
    "while primus provides a large number of redshifts out to @xmath87 , due to its use of a low dispersion prism , the redshift uncertainties are significantly larger ( @xmath88 ) than the uncertainties of the sdss-_galex _ redshifts . in order to have comparable environment measures throughout our redshift range",
    ", we apply primus redshift uncertainties to our galaxy sample selected from sdss-_galex_. for each sdss-_galex _ galaxy , we adjust its redshift by randomly sampling a gaussian distribution with standard deviation @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the redshift of the galaxy .      we now classify our mass complete galaxy sample into quiescent or star - forming using an evolving cut based on specific star - formation rate utilized in @xcite section 3.2 .",
    "this classification method uses the star - forming ( sf ) sequence , which is the correlation between star - formation rate ( sfr ) and stellar mass in star - forming galaxies observed at least until @xmath91 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the primus sample displays a well - defined sf sequence within the redshift range of our galaxy sample . using the power - law slope for the sf sequence from @xcite ( sfr @xmath92 ) and the minimum of the quiescent / star - forming bimodality , determined empirically ,",

    "we note that the significant difference among the sdss distribution and the primus distributions above is due to the different stellar mass completeness limits imposed on each redshift bin of our galaxy sample . ]",
    "we define the environment of a galaxy as the number of neighboring environment defining population galaxies ( defined below ) within a fixed aperture centered around it .",
    "we use fixed aperture measurements in order to quantify galaxy environment with an aperture sufficiently large to encompass massive halos ( @xcite ) . for our aperture",
    ", we use a cylinder of dimensions : @xmath98 and @xmath95 .",
    "we use a cylindrical aperture to account for the primus redshift errors and redshift space distortions ( i.e.  finger of god \" effect ) . as @xcite and @xcite find , @xmath99 optimally reduces the effects of redshift space distortions .",
    "the primus redshift uncertainty at @xmath100 corresponds to @xmath101 , so our choice of @xmath102 for the aperture height accounts for both of these effects .",
    "our choice of cylinder radius was motivated by scale dependence analyses in the literature ( @xcite ) , which suggest that galactic properties such as color and quiescent fractions are most strongly dependent on scales @xmath103 mpc , around the host dark matter halo sizes .",

    "we use the same primus data used to select our galaxy sample ( described in section [ sec : target ] ) .",
    "we again restrict the primus galaxies to @xmath106 and divide them into bins of @xmath107 .",
    "before we consider the cumulative number densities in the redshift bins , we first determine the @xmath108 limit for the highest redshift bin ( @xmath109 ) by examining the @xmath104 distribution with bin size @xmath110 and select @xmath111 near the peak of the distribution where bins with @xmath112 have fewer galaxies than the bin at @xmath113 .",
    "we conservatively choose @xmath114 to be @xmath115 .",
    "then for the lower redshift bins , we impose absolute magnitude limits ( @xmath111 ) such that the cumulative number density , calculated with the galaxy statistical weights , of the bin ordered by @xmath104 is equal to the cumulative number density of the highest redshift bin with @xmath116 .    for the sdss edp , we do not use the sdss-_galex _ parent data , which is limited to the combined angular selection window of the vagc and _ galex _ ( section [ sec : sdss ] ) . instead",
    ", since fuv , nuv values are not necessary for the edp , we extend the parent data of the sdss edp to the entire nyu - vagc , including galaxies outside of the _ galex _ window function .",
    "furthermore , we impose a redshift range of @xmath117 on the sdss edp .",
    "this redshift range was determined to account for the lack of faint galaxies at @xmath118 and the lack of bright galaxies at @xmath119 in the vagc .",
    "as with the primus redshift bins , we determine the sdss edp @xmath113 by matching the cumulative number density of the highest redshift bin . for redshift bins @xmath6 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 we get @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 , respectively .",

    "we appropriately apply equivalent redshift adjustments for the sdss edp . for the sdss edp galaxies that are also contained within the sdss-_galex _ sample , we adjust the redshift by an identical amount . for the rest , we apply the same redshift adjustment procedure described in section [ sec : target ] in order to obtain primus level redshift uncertainties .",
    "finally , we measure the environment for each galaxy in our galaxy sample by counting the number of edp galaxies , @xmath69 , with ra , dec , and @xmath125 within our cylindrical aperture centered around it .",
    "@xmath69 accounts for the statistical weights of the edp galaxies .",
    "for our galaxy sample , the expected @xmath69 given the uniform number density in each of our edp redshift bin and volume of our cylindrical aperture is @xmath126 . once we obtain environment measurements for all the galaxies in our galaxy sample , we classify galaxies with @xmath96 to be in  low \" environment densities and galaxies with @xmath127 to be in  high \" environment densities .",
    "the high environment cutoff was selected in order to reduce contamination from galaxies in low environment densities while maintaining sufficient statistics . in section [ sec : env_qf_evol ] we will also explore higher density cutoffs for @xmath69 .",
    "the analysis we describe below uses a fixed cylindrical aperture with dimensions @xmath128 and @xmath129 to measure environment .",

    "the results obtained from using different apertures and environment classifications are qualitatively consistent with the results presented below .",
    "one of the challenges in obtaining accurate galaxy environments using a fixed aperture method is accounting for the edges of the survey .",
    "for galaxies located near the edge of the survey , part of the fixed aperture encompassing it will lie outside the survey regions . in this scenario , @xmath132 only reflects the fraction of the environment within the survey geometry .",
    "to account for these edge effects , we use a monte carlo method to impose edge cutoffs on our galaxy sample .",
    "first , using ` ransack ` from @xcite , we construct a random sample of @xmath133 points with ra and dec randomly selected within the window function of the edp ( sdss edp and primus edp separately ) .",
    "we then compute the angular separation , @xmath134 that corresponds to @xmath135 ( section [ sec : environment ] ) at the redshift of each sample galaxy @xmath136 .",

    "for example , in each of the primus redshift bins , @xmath145 of galaxies in the redshift bin are in low density environments and roughly @xmath148 are in high density environments . in contrast , in the sdss redshift bin , @xmath149 of galaxies in the redshift bin are in low density environments and @xmath150 are in high density environments .",
    "we remind the reader that this is mainly due to the varying stellar mass - completeness limits imposed on our galaxy sample for each redshift bins and does not affect our results .",

    "<S> we investigate the effects of galaxy environment on the evolution of the quiescent fraction ( @xmath0 ) from @xmath1 to @xmath2 using spectroscopic redshifts and multi - wavelength imaging data from the prism multi - object survey ( primus ) and the sloan digitial sky survey ( sdss ) . </S>",
    "<S> our stellar mass limited galaxy sample consists of @xmath3 primus galaxies within @xmath4 and @xmath5 sdss galaxies within @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we classify the galaxies as quiescent or star - forming based on an evolving specific star formation cut , and as low or high density environments based on fixed cylindrical aperture environment measurements on a volume - limited environment defining population . for quiescent and star - forming galaxies in low or high density environments , we examine the evolution of their stellar mass function ( smf ) . </S>",
    "<S> then using the smfs we compute @xmath7 and quantify its evolution within our redshift range . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the quiescent fraction is higher at higher masses and in denser environments . </S>",
    "<S> the quiescent fraction rises with cosmic time for all masses and environments . at a fiducial mass of @xmath8 , from @xmath9 to @xmath10 , </S>",
    "<S> the quiescent fraction rises by @xmath11 at the lowest environments and by @xmath12 at the highest environments we measure . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest that for a minority of galaxies their cessation of star formation is due to external influences on them </S>",
    "<S> . however , in the recent universe a substantial fraction of the galaxies that cease forming stars do so due to internal processes . </S>"
