    "the binary symmetric channel ( bsc ) is probably the most commonly used discrete channel in coding and information theory , not only because of its simplicity , but also because it represents the worst case scenario , when there is no information about the channel .",
    "this gives the hamming metric a prominent status since it is matched to the bsc ( the minimum distance decoder is equivalent to the maximum likelihood decoder ) .",
    "less attention was given to other metrics ( see @xcite and @xcite[chapter 16 ] for applications of other metrics in coding theory ) .",
    "the general problem of determining if a channel is matched to a metric , or in other words , if a channel is metrizable ( in analogy to metrizable spaces in topology ) has been very little explored ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "when this occurs , it gives more structure to the channel , and it might be useful for , among other things , the construction of efficient codes since with distances , come other related concepts such as : packing radius , perfect codes , mds codes , etc .",
    "we present mainly two results : an algorithm which determines if a channel is metrizable ; and show that the hamming metric is universal , in the sense that , for any metrizable channel , this metric can be used for decoding purposes .",
