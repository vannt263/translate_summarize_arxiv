    "the objects discussed below | the gravitational strings | have much in common with the conventional cosmic strings .",
    "so , i begin with a brief reminder of a few key facts about the latter @xcite .    the appearance of the cosmic strings in the early universe is usually explained as follows .",
    "suppose , after the universe had cooled below some critical temperature , a complex scalar field @xmath0 appeared with the mexican - hat potential @xmath1 one expects the field to take the minimal energy value , i.  e. , @xmath2 with arbitrary @xmath3 .",
    "but the evolutions of the field in different regions are _ uncorrelated _ and this can make the process energetically prohibited even though _ locally _ it is energetically favourable",
    ". indeed , if the field happened to develop a non - zero winding number on some loop @xmath4 , see figure  [ ris1 ] ,     a ) the arrows represent complex numbers , not 3-vectors .",
    "b ) the ray @xmath5 is parallel to @xmath6 and starts from the same point as @xmath7 . still ,",
    "all three meet in @xmath8 .",
    "c ) the images of a non - pointlike source are rotated w.  r.  t. each other .",
    "d ) what looks as two thick curves is , in fact , a single continuous curve.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    then it can not be extended to a surface enclosed by @xmath4 without vanishing in some point . clearly , the energy density around that point will be non - zero .",
    "this fact is purely topological , so if we continuously deform the loop or the surface , the point with the non - zero energy density will persist .",
    "so , the field configuration is an endless thin tube .",
    "the tube is stable : even though it is surrounded by vacuum , it can not dissolve for the topological reasons discussed above .",
    "it is such tubes that are called ( material ) cosmic strings .",
    "the importance of cosmic strings , as well as their most promising ( from the observational point of view ) manifestation stem from their | quite unusual | gravitational fields .",
    "the universe with a straight endless string is believed to be described | _ at large @xmath9 _ | by the spacetime @xmath10 it is often convenient to represent the sections @xmath11 of this spacetime as the results of the following surgery : a dihedral angle having the @xmath12-axis as its edge is cut out of the euclidean space @xmath13 and the half - planes bounding it are glued together ( with no shift along the axis ) . since the axis can not be glued back into the spacetime , there is a singularity now  in its place \" .",
    "this singularity ( often called conical ) is sometimes associated in folklore with the string itself .",
    "when a string moves through the cosmological fluid it leaves a wake behind it : as is seen from fig .",
    "[ ris1]b , two _ parallelly _ moving galaxies may nevertheless collide after a string has passed between them    two light rays emitted from the same source may , for exactly the same reasons , come to an observer from different directions , see fig .",
    "thus , a string acts as a gravitational lens producing multiple images of a single object , see  fig .",
    "now let us consider the purely gravitational case .",
    "at the end of the planck era the classical spacetime had emerged and started to expand obeying the einstein equations . by the time",
    "it could be confidently called classical it was practically flat ( by planck standards , anyway ) , so we can speak of emergence of a flat spacetime .",
    "one can think , however , that remote regions evolved uncorrelatedly and the locally fovourable process of becoming minkowskian might be impeded by some _",
    "global _ obstacles .",
    "for example , a circle lying in a newborn ( non - simply connected ) flat region might happen to be too short ( or too long ) for its radius of curvature .",
    "exactly as with matter fields such obstacles would give rise to singularities . this time",
    ", however , those would be true _",
    "geometric _ singularities and of a rather unusual kind at that : the spacetime is flat , so the singularities are not associated with infinite curvature , or energy density , etc .",
    "it is such singularities | more precisely two - dimensional singularities in flat spacetime | that i call gravitational strings ( gs ) .",
    "an example of a gs is the singularity in the spacetime  ( [ 1 ] ) ( the latter must be understood this time literally , not as an approximation valid at large @xmath9 ) .",
    "other examples can be obtained , if one of the mentioned half - planes , before it is glued to the other , is shifted along the @xmath12-axis @xcite , or the @xmath14-axis @xcite , or , finally , is boosted in the @xmath12-direction @xcite .",
    "the resulting spacetimes are quite different , but each contains an infinite straight gravitational string at rest . recently the list was supplemented by more curious species @xcite including spiral strings , rotating straight strings , and even closed strings .",
    "the ( sections @xmath11 of the ) latter are obtained | or , rather , are described | as follows .",
    "remove the closure of the circle @xmath15 from the euclidean space @xmath13 , rotate one of the banks of the thus obtained slit ( either is a copy of @xmath16 ) by some @xmath17 w.  r.  t. to the @xmath12-axis , and , finally , glue the banks together .",
    "the missing circumference bd@xmath18 ( it can not be glued back into the space ) is a gs , see  fig .",
    "[ ris1]d .",
    "thus , a new class of objects is introduced | the gravitational strings .",
    "they have much in common with the conventional ( matter ) cosmic strings : both species are equally  realistic \" ( the reasons to believe in their existence are much the same ) , equally important cosmologically ( both leave wakes ) and have similar lensing properties . still , in some respects they are quite different . in particular ,",
    "the relevant spacetime being _ empty _ , the evolution of a gravitational string , its form , its gravitational field , etc .",
    "have nothing to do with properties of any matter field , with the nambu action , and so on .",
    "whether gravitational strings do exist is , ultimately , to be answered by observations .",
    "so , what would one expect to observe if there is a circular ( this form is chosen , because it is easier to imagine the formation of a _ finite _ object ) string of a galactic size located far enough from the earth and tilted by an angle  @xmath19 ( no fine tuning ! ) relative to the line of sight ?      in analyzing this situation it is convenient to view the  real \" space as the euclidean space @xmath13 ( minus circumference ) where light rays are , as usual , straight lines , but where one additional rule holds : if a ray meets @xmath16 , its extension beyond @xmath16 is rotated by @xmath20 w.  r.  t. to the @xmath12-axis .",
    "so , to determine what the observer sees if there is a bright source @xmath21 near the string , rotate @xmath21 by @xmath20 obtaining thus a  fictituous \" source @xmath22 , see fig .",
    "if one of the straight lines    other does not , then the observer will see both images @xmath21 and @xmath22 , otherwise only one of them .",
    "note that the two images are not _ exactly _ same : because @xmath19 , they are rotated w.  r.  t. to each other . in summary : if there is an appropriately located galaxy , see  fig .",
    "[ ris2]b , then what we must see is two close galaxies with similar spectra , or in other words , two images of the same galaxy as seen from different angles , see  fig .",
    "[ ris2]c .",
    "remarkably , such a picture _ is _ observed @xcite .",
    "a pair of galaxies called csl-1 are 1.9 arcsec separated and have the same spectra identical at 98% confidence level .",
    "this strongly suggests that what we see ( a hst image is shown in fig .",
    "[ ris2]d ) is , in fact , two images of the _ same _ galaxy .",
    "the isophotes are not distorted , so the lensing presumably does not involve a strong gravitational field , which rules out a galaxy , or a conventional loop string as the lens . at the same time it is not a straight infinite string , because no more pairs have been found in that region of the sky , while calculations predict at least 9 ones @xcite .",
    "it seems , thus , quite natural to interpret csl-1 as an observational proof of the existence of gravitational strings .",
