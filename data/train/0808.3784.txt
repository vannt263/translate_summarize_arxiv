    "the main @xmath7 production mechanism is flavor creation through gluon fusion .",

    "however , the tevatron @xmath7 cross section is orders of magnitude smaller than the total inelastic cross section of @xmath9 . for this reason",
    ", cdf employs triggers that select events with signatures specific to various b decays .",
    "the measurements presented here uses data selected by the di - muon trigger , geared towards @xmath10 decays and by the displaced track trigger used for measurement of @xmath2 lifetime in @xmath11 decays .",

    "in particular , non - relativistic potential models @xcite predict the range @xmath15 . lattice qcd models @xcite predict @xmath16 , while similar results are determined in perturbative qcd calculations @xcite .    the lifetime of the @xmath1 meson is expected to be @xmath17 @xcite which is about a third of the typical light b meson lifetime of @xmath18 . the short lifetime is explained by the fact that either the @xmath12 or the @xmath19 quarks can decay weakly through a @xmath20 boson .",
    "when the @xmath12 quark decays , the final state contains a charmonium particles while the decay of the @xmath19 quark results in a @xmath6 meson final state .",
    "additionally , the @xmath12 and @xmath19 quarks can annihilate , for example into a lepton and neutrino final state .",

    "0.2 cm the mass of the @xmath1 meson was measured for the first time by the cdf experiment in run  i  @xcite using inclusive semileptonic decays @xmath21 . since the @xmath1 meson was not fully reconstructed due to the missing neutrino , the result had large uncertainties @xmath22 .    the most precise measurement of the @xmath1 mass was recently performed by the cdf experiment using @xmath23 of data @xcite using the fully reconstructed decay mode @xmath24 .",
    "the advantage of using fully reconstructed decays is that the mass of the decaying particle can be measured precisely by fitting the invariant mass distribution .",
    "the measurement was performed using data collected by the cdf @xmath25 trigger .",
