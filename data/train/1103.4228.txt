    "the bl lac objects and core - dominated quasars in the @xcite sample were more highly polarized then the sample fri and frii radio sources .",
    "on the other hand , the polarized compact radio source may be css radio sources .",
    "css sources are radio sources that are unresolved at arc - second scales and are considered to be young radio sources with ages @xmath139years @xcite .",
    "polarization observations of css sources show that these objects are weakly polarized , with the median @xmath87 of @xmath140% at @xmath4ghz , but increasing with frequency @xcite .",
    "the young ages of css sources imply that classical radio lobes have not yet formed and hence the radio emission probably originates in the central core of the host galaxy where there is a lot of dense and inhomogeneous gaseous material",
    ". therefore the lower degree of percentage polarization may be caused by internal faraday effects like the ` partial coverage ' of the narrow - line region ( nlr ) as mentioned by @xcite .",
    "the compact polarized radio sources in our sample can be a mixture of both types of radio sources .",
    "the weak trend and poorer fit to compact sources for @xmath87 and luminosity density suggests that these objects are a separate radio population from the resolved polarized sources and do not have dramatically evolving magnetic fields .",
    "if , however , these compact objects are css sources and are the younger versions of the powerful radio - loud agn , then this suggests there is magnetic field evolution from the compact radio sources to the resolved radio sources , since resolved radio sources tend to be more polarized ( see * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite studied 26 powerful radio - loud agns and found a difference in rm in the separate lobes of the radio sources , indicating that the difference is internal to the source .",
    "the difference in the rm of each lobe and the dispersion in rm both correlate with redshift but not with luminosity or source size , pointing to more turbulent environments for high redshift agn compared to their low redshift counterparts . in the cases of @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the radio source samples are high flux density radio sources which are known to be less polarized than lower flux density radio sources .",
    "our study consists of polarized radio sources predominantly below @xmath145mjy and our sources lie in the same luminosity range as @xcite .",
    "we do not find a trend of percentage polarization with redshift , indicating that our sources may be a different population than those studied by @xcite and @xcite .",

    "these higher resolution polarimetric observations will help to determine whether fris or friis are more highly polarized .",

    "the infrared fluxes from swire show that the majority of polarized radio sources in our sample have hosts that are old elliptical galaxies with an imbedded agn .",
    "these galaxies can be either high or low luminosity radio sources . the rest of the polarized radio sources have host galaxies where the infrared emission originates from light reprocessed by dust and gas and where the radio emission comes from the agn .",
    "the agn hosted by elliptical galaxies are more highly polarized than the agn with infrared emission from dust and gas . correlating",

    "we were nevertheless able to determine a weak correlation between @xmath87 and luminosity .",
    "the trend of increasing @xmath87 with decreasing @xmath142 shows that low - luminosity radio sources are more polarized than high - luminosity radio sources for sources in the flux density range of @xmath147mjy .",
