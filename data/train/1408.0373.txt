    "the valuable expertise gained on nuclear spins in quantum dots ( qds ) over the past decade has revolutionized the traditional research on semiconductor physics.@xcite for instance , solid - state quantum memories , a vital component for quantum information technologies , count on the long coherence times of nuclear spins.@xcite in addition to storing the quantum state , nuclear spins potentially can act as the central processing unit as in ensemble computing@xcite that can also be extended to quadrupolar nuclei,@xcite or , they can present an ideal testbed for quantum control as an integral part of an exciton - nuclei feedback loop.@xcite    another emerging utility of qd nuclear spins is for the materials science as a targeted nanoscale diagnostic tool . on this front",
    ", there have been recent advances in analytical techniques such as cross - sectional scanning tunneling microscopy,@xcite coherent x - ray diffraction - based three - dimensional mapping,@xcite and the atom probe tomography.@xcite routinely , the nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) had been one of the preferred choices in identifying below the parts - per - million - level concentration of rare constituents.@xcite this , however works on macroscopic samples still of molar sizes .",
    "when it comes to probing a _ single _ qd , the applicability of the conventional nmr is hampered because of the insufficient equilibrium magnetizations within such small volumes .",
    "added to this , is the low sensitivity inherent in detection by the magnetic induction of precessing magnetization.@xcite if instead , the already proven optical orientation framework is pursued , the electron spin can efficiently polarize the nuclear spins within the qd through the contact hyperfine interaction.@xcite this nuclear polarization , known as the overhauser field , acts back on the exciton and shifts its energy as it recombines , leaving a trace on the photoluminescence ( pl ) .",
    "overall , this makes up the recipe for the nmr of a single qd , which is termed as the optically detected nmr ( odnmr).@xcite for the detection , it relies on the measurement of either the overhauser field - shifted excitonic pl with a @xmath0ev - resolution,@xcite or the faraday rotation in the reflected probe beam with a sensitivity below 1  mrad.@xcite    it is also desirable to use odnmr on the widely accessible self - assembled qds ( saqds ) .",
    "however , an issue that is prevalent in saqds is that they inherently possess an inhomogeneous and anisotropic strain.@xcite in a iii - v semiconductor crystal lattice , such a strain field causes local electric field gradients ( efg ) with which a quadrupolar spin-@xmath1 nucleus , i.e. , with @xmath2 , interacts because of its electric quadrupole moment.@xcite this quadrupole interaction ( qi ) splits the nuclear spin degeneracy even in the absence of an external magnetic field , and severely broadens the resonances .",
    "this has posed a challenge for employing standard odnmr in saqds giving rise to poor signal to noise ratio .",
    "very recently the problem has been alleviated by introducing a so - called _ inverted _ radio frequency ( rf ) excitation scheme.@xcite this increased substantially the fraction of nuclei participating in the overhauser shift .",
    "a breakthrough not only for the atomistic level structural information on strained saqds , but also for the quantum information technologies .",
    "this is thanks to the crucial structural information it can supply , much needed both to engineer a noise - free nuclear spin bath and also to perform a coherent control over the bloch sphere of relatively small number of nuclear spins.@xcite    after this successful experimental demonstration of the odnmr inverse spectra on strained qds,@xcite its full potential awaits to be explored on a theoretical level .",
    "therefore , the aim of this work is to undertake a computational assessment , choosing ingaas qds as the test case .",
    "primarily , we would like to address what kind of atomistic level information can possibly be extracted by the technique , and where to look for these . in particular we give special importance to the central transition lineshape as this is experimentally the most conspicuous spectral feature .",
    "moreover , it carries important clues about the internal structure of the qd .",
    "thus , we perform a detailed search over the parameter space of the inverse spectra technique .",
    "this sheds light on the line profiles and resolution trade offs , as well as experimentally more impracticable aspects such as the dependence of the sample orientation with respect to the magnetic field . by comparing a binary inas qd with an identical - shape alloy in@xmath3ga@xmath4as counterpart , we uncover key fingerprints of the alloy composition .",
    "furthermore , we explain the basis of these behaviors in terms of available atomistic configurations . with this insight , we intend to unfold the prospects of the inverse spectra technique as a tool to resolve atomistic - level variations in strained nanostructures .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we present the theoretical setting of our atomistic analysis . in sec .",
    "iii we provide information about our benchmark cases , followed by our results . in sec .",
    "iv we conclude by itemizing our major findings . in the interest of a lucid presentation , we defer additional technical supporting materials and figures to a number of appendixes .",
    "appendix  a discusses nuclear polarizations , and more specifically why it is harder to polarize the arsenic nuclei in a strained environment .",
    "appendix  b contains efg - related histograms for the alloy and the compound qds . in appendix",
    "c we consider the role of specific quadrupole parameters on the lineshape .",
    "the last appendix illustrates the effects of individual efg parameters on spectral transitions of a single nucleus to authenticate some of the assertions in the main text .",
    "the crux of our analysis is based on the simultaneous use of a number of coordinate systems .",
    "a qd has a native coordinate system set through the crystallographic axes where the qd growth axis usually coincides with one of them ; in our test cases this is the @xmath5-axis and the [ 001 ] direction .",
    "the orientations of an external magnetic field and the optical beam with respect to the growth axis of the qd bear particular significance in terms of which faraday / voigt geometries and @xmath6 pumping are defined .",
    "yet , there are at least two more relevant coordinate axes that gain importance in an atomistic treatment . unlike the global crystal axes , these are local , i.e. , they change orientation with position over the qd .",
    "they are defined through strain and the efg tensors , denoted in cubic crystallographic @xmath7 components by @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the two phenomena are linked through @xmath10 , the fourth - rank gradient elastic tensor as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the crystal electric field potential.@xcite in the so - called voigt notation , the @xmath10 tensor for cubic crystals is governed by only two independent components @xmath13 and @xmath14 , both of which are experimentally measurable.@xcite in cubic crystallographic @xmath7 axes , @xmath13 and @xmath14 relate the diagonal and off - diagonal strain and efg components , respectively , like @xmath15 , @xmath16 , etc . where @xmath17 is the so - called biaxial strain .",
    "similarly , we find it necessary to introduce a shear strain measure as @xmath18 to quantify the effectiveness of the off - diagonal components.@xcite    the strain and efg tensors have their own distinct principal axes where each becomes diagonal , and within which working with that quantity becomes highly convenient . among the three principal axes of a rank-2 quantity ( such as strain or efg ) , the one with the largest absolute value",
    "is named as the _ major _ principal axis .",
    "hence , this brings three concomitant coordinate systems at one s disposal .",
    "our primary interest in nuclear spin states in the presence of qi favors the explicit use of local efg principal axes which we shall discriminate by the @xmath19 capital letters,@xcite with axes being labeled so as to satisfy the inequalities @xmath20 , making @xmath21 the major efg axis .      in the local @xmath19 frame the strain - dependent part of the nuclear hamiltonian responsible for the qi",
    "is given by @xmath22\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the dimensionless nuclear spin angular momentum vector operator , through which we define the above raising / lowering scalar operators @xmath24 .",
    "as to the other variables , @xmath25 is the electric quadrupole moment of the nucleus , @xmath26 is the efg parameter which is also the primary coupling constant of qi , with @xmath27 being the electronic charge , and @xmath28 is the biaxiality parameter , satisfying @xmath29 by construction , and it determines the mixing between the free nuclear spin magnetic quantum numbers .    in the same local @xmath19 frame",
    "the static magnetic field vector @xmath30 will be in general oblique as described by the spherical polar angles @xmath31 , and @xmath32 so that its hamiltonian becomes@xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is the nuclear gyromagnetic ratio . hence , for each nucleus @xmath36 under consideration , @xmath37 needs to be solved , where we denote the resultant spectrum with @xmath38 , @xmath39 . under sufficiently high magnetic fields , which we assume throughout our work , dipole - allowed transitions are @xmath40 . among these , the strongest one @xmath41",
    "is referred to as the central transition ( ct ) , and the remaining weaker ones as the satellite transitions ( sts ) .",
    "when the efg major principal axis deviates from the @xmath30 direction , ct becomes broadened only as a second - order effect , hence stays quite narrow , whereas sts undergo extensive broadening as they are affected in first order.@xcite      we characterize the nuclear spin ensemble within the qd by a nuclear spin temperature @xmath42 which is a measure of the degree of optical orientation .",
    "the probability of occupancy of each nuclear spin state , @xmath43 is governed by a thermal distribution of the form @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the helicity of the absorbed optical orientation beam dictates the spin of the created electron and hole as a requirement of angular momentum conservation .",
    "subsequently , through predominantly the contact hyperfine interaction between the electron and nuclear spins , depending on the absorbed photon helicity the nuclear spins are either pumped down or up within their individual spectrum @xmath38 , toward @xmath46 or @xmath47 , respectively.@xcite in the absence of an rf excitation , and under continuous optical orientation this distribution will be sustained .",
    "therefore , the steady - state is either _ normal _ for @xmath48 , or _ inverted _ for @xmath49 persistent pumping .",
    "we represent the former ( latter ) by using a positive ( negative ) nuclear spin temperature , i.e. , @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "the novelty of the inverse spectra technique with respect to conventional saturation spectroscopy comes from its inverted excitation scheme , which has a white spectrum except for a frequency gap ,",
    "@xmath52.@xcite if this gap does not coincide with any of the dipole - allowed transitions @xmath53 , then under a sufficiently long excitation , the population of all nuclear spin states will be equilibrated at the same value , @xmath54 , giving rise to zero nuclear polarization , and hence no overhauser shift on the excitonic pl .",
    "on the other hand when the gap coincides with one , or sometimes simultaneously with a number of transitions , the equilibration will only occur within the states that remain under the gap - free parts of the excitation .",
    "therefore , the @xmath55 states will be split into multiple groups,@xcite each internally reaching to an individual saturation value based on the preexisting thermal populations of the member states according to @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the group index , and @xmath58 is the number of member spin states within that group .    the spin polarization of a nucleus @xmath36 just after rf excitation will be based on the population of each state @xmath59 the optical pumping direction along which the electronic spin is aligned , which is usually , but not always the qd growth axis , then the parallel component of the nuclear polarization becomes @xmath60 . in the experiments ,",
    "the changes in the nuclear polarization are probed via the overhauser energy shift in the excitonic pl signal@xcite which is given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the hyperfine coupling constant , and @xmath63 is the electronic wave function at the nuclear site . here ,",
    "we ignore the hole hyperfine interaction which is about an order of magnitude weaker.@xcite",
    "the detailed chemical composition profile , i.e. , local stoichiometry of ingaas qds is still an active and unresolved topic.@xcite a critical factor that nontrivially affects the uniformity of the indium distribution within the qd is the annealing process .",
    "it has been reported that the annealed qds become less uniform along the lateral , but more uniform along the growth direction ; furthermore , the dots get 25% bigger with respect to their pre - annealed sizes in both lateral and growth directions as the indium atoms out - diffuse while the gallium atoms diffuse inward.@xcite we base our comparative analysis on two test cases of lens - shaped qds having a base diameter of 40  nm and a height of 6  nm .",
    "both qds have an inas wetting layer and are embedded into a gaas host matrix , but differ in their interior compositions , with one qd being inas , whereas the other being the alloy in@xmath3ga@xmath4as ( see , inset of fig .  [ binary - vs - alloy ] ) , where indium and gallium atoms are randomly distributed all over the qd region according to the given mole fraction .",
    "admittedly , these constitute the two extremes , and intermediate cases like partially segregated alloy realizations are not addressed in this work . the uniform alloy composition considered here",
    "is expected under high growth rate conditions , where the landing atoms on the surface do not have time to segregate into binary compounds , as they quickly get covered by the next layer.@xcite the rationale behind the selection of these two cases is based on their distinct strain , and hence quadrupolar characteristics.@xcite    the computational supercell contains more than 2 million atoms , most of them residing in the host matrix , and the qd itself has 171,884 atoms .",
    "we follow the procedure presented in ref .   for the relaxation of the embedded qds to their final structures , and the extraction of the atomistic strain distributions .",
    "the only exception in the present work is that we do not perform any nearest - neighbor strain averaging as this would hinder the true linewidths of the isotope - dependent nmr spectra .",

    "[ isotope - helicity ] . even though the number of arsenic nuclei is the largest , their ct resonance has the smallest peak , the reason for which is related to the hardness in polarizing the arsenic nuclei as elaborated further in appendix  a. the indium nuclei because of their 9/2 spins , have much extended sts as can be observed from the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ isotope - helicity ] .",
    "the spectrum asymmetry of the neighboring sts on either side of the ct are seen to be switched by changing pumping helicity ( see , fig .",
    "[ isotope - helicity ] lower panel ) , as a matter of fact the contrast can be enhanced further by increasing the initial polarization which amounts to lowering of @xmath42 .",
    "also note that to boost the small differences , here we prefer to use a larger @xmath52 value of 800  khz .    in experiments ,",
    "the choice of @xmath52 value can indeed become a crucial decision for the inverse spectra .",
    "to highlight the trade off between spectral resolution and the signal intensity , in fig .",
    "[ fgap - scan ] we display the spectral evolution as a function of @xmath52 for each isotopic species .",
    "the resolution - limited flat - top profiles quickly emerge for the gallium nuclei indicating their narrow linewidths as will be analyzed below in more depth . on the other hand , for indium and especially arsenic nuclei",
    ", a large @xmath52 value may still be preferred which is particularly beneficial to capture the relatively weak features associated with the sts .",
    "one example for this is the emergence under larger @xmath52 values of an additional st peak as indicated by an arrow on the top left arsenic panel of fig .",
    "[ fgap - scan ] . for a spin-3/2 system",
    "only three peaks are expected , namely , 3/2@xmath651/2 , 1/2@xmath65 - 1/2 , and -1/2@xmath65 - 3/2 .",
    "therefore , this fourth peak which unambiguously belongs to arsenic nuclei ( see , fig .",
    "[ isotope - helicity ] , top panel ) is rather curious .",
    "we identify it as the _ alloy peak _ with a reasoning based on an atomistic configuration analysis , however deferring its detailed discussion for now .",
    "the ct lineshape is one of the means to probe information on the nuclear spin environment . for this purpose",

    "skewness is a dimensionless asymmetry parameter ; for unimodal cases zero skewness corresponds to a symmetric distribution around its mode so that tails on either side balance out .",
    "kurtosis is a dimensionless measure of relative peakedness or flatness of a distribution ; for a normal distribution it becomes zero .",
    "we employ these shape quantifiers on the ct of alloy in@xmath3ga@xmath4as qd for all isotopes as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ moments ] which not only corroborate well with the observations of fig .",
    "[ ct - isotopes ] but also reveal some additional trends . for all isotopes",
    "the standard deviations diverge as the magnetic field decrease below 2  t into the qi - dominant regime .",
    "the @xmath68ga isotope has the narrowest @xmath75 which is also matched by @xmath67ga at high magnetic fields .",
    "regarding skewness , @xmath68ga monotonically changes its asymmetry from red- to blue - tailed making a transition at 5  t. as was qualitatively noted from fig .",
    "[ ct - isotopes ] , it is quantitatively asserted in fig .  [ moments ] that in and as possess opposite skewness , a point which we shall discuss further after we lay out the atomistic structural analysis .",
    "finally , from the kurtosis panel we observe that all isotopes start from a flat distribution within the qi - dominant regime at low magnetic fields which evolves to a peaked shape at higher fields .",
    "the gallium isotopes go through maxima around 4  t and 9  t for @xmath68ga and @xmath67ga , respectively .",
    "as illustrated in appendix  b through a number of histograms , the spread of quadrupole axial tilting is most pronounced for the as nuclei among all elements .",
    "this can be linked to the combined effect of the large _ variation _ in the shear strain component , @xmath76 of as atoms , compounded by the particularly high @xmath14 value of as nuclei that is more than 2.5 times of those of ga and in values ; see , also appendix  c. the large variance in @xmath76 of as has a chemical origin which stems from the mixed cation neighbors in the tetrahedral bonding : center as atom is coordinated with a different number of ga / in atoms depending on the local alloy realization .",
    "the corresponding tilt angles , @xmath31 of the major efg axes in each bonding configuration are presented in table  [ arsenic - configs ] .",
    "this is in support of a recent nmr study which concludes that @xmath77as qi is highly sensitive to different cation coordinations.@xcite in the case of in or ga atoms their nearest neighbors are always as , thus , the local strain variation in the cations ( ga , in ) is more of a _ next - nearest - neighbor _ effect .",
    "_ what is the physical implication of large variance in quadrupole axial tilting ?",
    "_ the nuclear dipole - dipole interaction is the main channel for nuclear spin diffusion via pairwise flip - flops .",
    "however , if the major quadrupolar alignment of each of the involved nuclei is significantly off , this inhibits a flip - flop event on the basis of energy mismatch .",
    "we noted above that the alloy qd and in particular the as nuclei have a much wider variation in quadrupole axial tilting due to change in the local neighborhood as compared to the compound qd case .",
    "therefore , qds with large variance in shear strain are ideal candidates for reduced nuclear spin diffusion , hence prolonged @xmath78 times , as validated by recent experiments ( see , ref .  , and references therein ) .",
    "in fact , in resemblance to _ defect centers _ that receive wide attention for spintronics applications,@xcite a random alloy in@xmath79ga@xmath80as qd , especially of low molar fraction can be termed as a _ defect colony _ with so many indium atoms replacing the gallium of the host lattice .",

    "qd , as there is only cation - alloying on the interfaces , there are almost no perpendicularly - tilted as nuclei ( bottom left panel in fig .",

    "that is , the ct profile of in has positive skew ( blue - tailed ) , while that for as has negative skew ( red - tailed ) .",
    "the origin of these opposite behaviors is rooted in the corresponding disparity in their efg characteristics manifested by two - dimensional histograms in fig .",
    "[ histogram-2d ] .",
    "specifically , for the case of as , the group of nuclei strongly tilted with @xmath82 and @xmath83 , and for the case of in those almost untilted @xmath84 but with large @xmath85 are responsible for the opposite skewness .",
    "for the latter , this large @xmath85 occurs from those in atoms residing in a relatively large biaxial strain environment , unlike the as or ga atoms in relation to their ct . to reconcile these features with the displayed skewness patterns we make use of a single - nucleus analysis . refering to appendix  d ,",
    "efg axial tilt at a constant @xmath85 causes a red shift of the ct as the tilt increases up to @xmath86 ; on the other hand for the case of nearly untilted nuclei , increasing @xmath85 and/or increasing efg biaxiality , @xmath87 both cause a blue shift of the ct .    to further substantiate these points , in fig .",

    "this stems from the large @xmath14 component of the gradient elastic tensor of arsenic nucleus , as well as nearest - neighbor variations because of cation alloying , not present for in and ga categorically .",
    "an implication of these is that if there exists an alloy structure within the qd region , this can be identified , in principle by an additional peak in the arsenic st .",
    "specifically , it originates from those arsenic nuclei with their major quadrupolar efg axes tilted perpendicular to the growth axis , a direct outcome of alloying .",
    "( iii )  _ sample tilt _ ; finally , we predict the collapse of the sts onto ct which is most pronounced in compound inas qds , and the possibility of negating qi and restoring a monoenergetic distribution like a solitary zeeman interaction , simultaneously for all isotopic nuclear spins by tilting the sample about 52@xmath96 with respect to static magnetic field .",
    "these findings must be verified experimentally and superseded by further studies for the purposes of both atomistic material insights and also for the coherent control of a relatively small number of nuclear spins embedded in a strained confined environment .",

    "in this appendix , we discuss the average nuclear spin orientation for each isotopic ensemble within the alloy in@xmath3ga@xmath4as qd in the presence of both zeeman and qi terms . even though the results here are qualitatively along the normal expectations , the quantitative details and isotopic variations may still be worthwhile considering . in fig .",
    "[ polarization ] we show the average nuclear polarization along the static magnetic field , @xmath97 for each isotopic ensemble as well as the total values , based on the weighted contribution of each isotope within the qd ; in part ( a ) , the upper plot depicts nuclear spin temperature dependence at a fixed magnetic field of 5  t , whereas the lower plot shows how it varies with respect to magnetic field at a fixed nuclear spin temperature , @xmath98  mk .",
    "the latter depends on the optical pumping and nuclear spin energetics .",
    "qualitatively , in both cases all isotopes display the expected polarization trends under increased magnetic field or decreased nuclear spin temperature . on the quantitative side",
    ", there is a striking difference among the elements , namely arsenic nuclear ensemble s polarization is substantially lower than the other elements .",
    "this is the origin of the mentioned smallest ct peak of arsenic among all elements in fig .",
    "[ isotope - helicity ]",
    ". stated quantitatively , at @xmath64  t and @xmath98  mk , arsenic nuclear spin polarization is about 44% , whereas @xmath67ga @xmath99 58% , @xmath68ga @xmath99 68% , and @xmath93 in @xmath99 81% . with the largest population belonging to the arsenic nuclei due to alloy partitioning between cations , the overall average polarization value ( denoted as total in fig",
    ".  [ polarization ] ) comes out as 55% , i.e. , closer to that of the arsenic value .",
    "ga@xmath4as qd .",
    "( a ) using the original gyromagnetic ratio for arsenic , ( b ) with the @xmath77as gyromagnetic ratio artificially increased to the average value of @xmath67ga and @xmath68ga , i.e. , @xmath100 .",
    "linestyle sets are the same for each panel . ]",
    "_ why is it harder to orient the arsenic nuclei ? _ by far the most critical factor is the gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath35 which is substantially smaller for arsenic compared to other elements . to illustrate this point ,",
    "we artificially increase @xmath35 for @xmath77as by 55% so that it reaches to the average value of the @xmath67ga and @xmath68ga ensemble .",
    "it can be observed in part ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ polarization ] that arsenic as well as the total nuclear polarization now lie in between the @xmath67ga and @xmath68ga curves .",
    "in particular , for @xmath64  t and @xmath98  mk , the arsenic spin alignment increases from its actual value of 44% to 62% .",
    "the underlying reason is that qi has a _ bidirectional _ character ; being an electrostatic interaction in nature , it can not discriminate the states @xmath101 , whereas zeeman interaction being _ unidirectional _ splits the @xmath102 and @xmath103 states thereby promoting nuclear spin polarization ( see , fig .",
    "[ uni - bi ] ) . in other words",
    ", while the static magnetic field ( zeeman term ) tries to polarize the nuclear spins , qi tries to erase this .",
    "hence , with their low @xmath35 value , @xmath77as nuclei are more prone to the quadrupolar _ depolarization _ compared to other isotopes at the same external magnetic field . in the case for pure inas qd ( not shown ) ,",
    "the trends are similar , however , as this qd is much more strained , here the relevant component is the biaxial strain , @xmath104,@xcite the quadrupolar effects are somewhat more pronounced .",
    "in this appendix , histograms for the three efg parameters , namely , major quadrupole axial tilting away from the static magnetic field , @xmath31 , the value of the major efg , @xmath105 , and the efg biaxiality , @xmath87 are discussed comparatively for the alloy and compound qds . starting with axial tilting for the alloy in@xmath3ga@xmath4as qd as displayed in the top row of fig .",
    "[ histogram ] , we observe a remarkable dissimilarity in the orientations of arsenic nuclei in comparison to cations ( ga , in ) . the latter display",
    "somewhat similar characteristics , that peaks either along or perpendicular to the magnetic field . as mentioned in the main text , for the cation nuclei ( ga , in ) the quadrupole axial",
    "tilting is driven by a change in their next - nearest neighborhoods .",
    "all together there are 144 configurations ; we show in fig .",
    "[ alloy - configs ] two such gallium - centric instances where a change in the second - nearest neighbor atom switches the major efg axis from parallel to perpendicular orientation with respect to growth axis .",
    "the distribution of the axial tilting of as nuclei has two peaks at 45@xmath96 and 54.7@xmath96 that coincide with those pre - relaxed configurations of table  [ arsenic - configs ] , even obeying the same 1:2 ratio of the relative weights of these cation - bonding orientations .",
    "next , considering the binary inas qd , due to lack of alloying for this case , both in and as nuclei s major efg axes are more or less aligned along the magnetic field .",
    "the interface as atoms which are relatively low in number do still have mixed cation neighbors and this gives rise to some limited variance and axial tilting . analyzing the middle rows , in the alloy qd",
    "major efg values are evenly distributed on either side of zero , and grouped in a few bunches ; for the compound qd , the nuclei are gathered around a single @xmath105 value with opposite signs for in and as .",
    "the biaxiality parameters @xmath87 ( bottom rows ) of the two qds are also markedly different : they are spread over the full accessible range for the alloy qd , whereas the compound qd efg is quite uniaxial , mainly restricted to lower than the 0.25 value .",
    "the aim of this appendix is to develop a feeling for the importance of the individual nuclear quadrupole parameters ( @xmath106 ) of as in regard to ct lineshape . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ ct - material ] , if we double the electric quadrupole moment @xmath25 , the red - tailed asymmetry is enhanced indicating that its origin is the qi . in particular",
    ", the @xmath14 component of the gradient elastic tensor primarily controls the asymmetric profile : lowering this value to that of ga ( i.e. , decreasing by about 2.5 times ) drastically reduces the asymmetry , while setting it to zero totally removes and even reverses its direction .",
    "since @xmath14 relates the off - diagonal entries of efg and the strain tensors , its effectiveness directly invokes to the importance of shear strain on the ct asymmetry . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath13 component is not functional , doubling its value virtually leaves the asymmetry unchanged .",
    "note that all of the above statements refer to the in@xmath3ga@xmath4as qd . additionally , in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ ct - material ] we compare the alloy qd with the binary inas qd , where in the latter the ct asymmetry of as nuclei gets significantly enhanced .",
    "this is at odds with the established insight so far based on the prime importance of the shear strain , in conjunction with its small value for binary inas qd . as a matter of fact as shown in the left column of fig .",
    "[ strain - profiles ] , the interior of the in@xmath3ga@xmath4as qd retains an exuberant shear strain profile due to random alloying , whereas this gets diminished in the core of the inas qd and only becomes significant toward the interfaces .",
    "however , a change of roles is observed in the right column of the same figure where the compound qd has much stronger biaxial strain compared to alloy qd simply due to larger lattice mismatch between the core and the matrix regions . as we have stated in the atomistic analysis ( see ,",
    "also appendix  d ) , not only shear but also the biaxial strain component can cause a shift in ct ; the former acts through efg axial tilting as in alloy qd , and the latter via the major efg value in the case of compound qd .",
    "ga@xmath4as qd with @xmath52=1  khz , @xmath64  t , @xmath42= 3  mk , @xmath107 optical pumping .",
    "solid ( blue ) lines demonstrate the cases after a modification in material parameters , @xmath108 , as well as the case for binary inas qd .",
    "each peak is set unity to compare the lineshapes . ]     ( left ) and biaxial , @xmath104 ( right ) strain distributions for the in@xmath3ga@xmath4as ( top ) and inas ( bottom ) qds , cut through both ( 100 ) and ( 010 ) planes .",
    "the lens - shaped qd boundaries can easily be identified on the inas qd from the enclosing bright shear strain regions corresponding to the interfaces with the host matrix as well as the wetting layer . ]",
    "in this appendix considering a single nucleus governed by the general hamiltonian , @xmath109 , we present how ct and st frequencies shift under various combinations of the three efg parameters : the major efg value ( @xmath105 ) , the angular deviation of the major efg axis from the static magnetic field ( @xmath31 ) , and biaxiality ( @xmath87 ) . as the trends are qualitatively similar among the nuclear species of this work , for demonstration purposes we choose @xmath93 in .",
    "the static magnetic field is taken as 8  t which is used in some of our calculations in the text . within the sts , we consider the @xmath110 transition .",

    "figure  [ single - nucleus ] displays the variation with respect to each one of @xmath105 , @xmath31 , @xmath87 while keeping the other two parameters fixed . as",
    "the shift of ct is in second order under qi,@xcite the dependence on @xmath105 is quadratic , hence independent of its sign [ fig .",
    "[ single - nucleus](a ) ] ; in contrast , st shifts being first - order are much stronger [ fig .  [ single - nucleus](b)];. for both ct and st the direction of shift depends on @xmath31 . in the case of ct for small angles",
    "there is a blue shift with increasing @xmath85 , which becomes a red shift for larger angles , fig .",
    "[ single - nucleus](a ) ; , 10@xmath96 curve . for the specific case considered here ( @xmath93 in and @xmath113 ) this transition occurs at @xmath117 . yet , for even larger angles this reverts back to a blue shift , fig .",
    "[ single - nucleus](a ) , 90@xmath96 curve .",
    "the continuous variation of @xmath31 produces a cosine - type shift in either ct and st , again with the effect being much stronger for the latter , figs .",

    "other sts ( for the case of in ) display a similar pattern .",

    "[ single - nucleus](e ) and ( f ) ; in particular it shows a blue shift in ct for @xmath119 .",
