    "the atomic bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) trapped in double - well potentials builds up bosonic josephson junction ( bjj ) @xcite .",
    "since it exhibits abundant quantum properties in comparison to condensate in a single trap , the double - well condensate has already been intensively investigated theoretically in the last few years . as a bjj , the double - well condensate can not only display dc , ac josephson effects and the shapiro effect .",
    "it also exhibits an quantum nonlinear effect , named the macroscopic quantum self - trapping ( mqst ) @xcite . on the other hand , quantum fluctuation",
    "is believed to give rise to fascinating influence on above dynamical behaviors @xcite , such as collapse and revival of quantum oscillations @xcite , disappearance of coherence @xcite , and destruction of the self - trapped state @xcite .",
    "experimentally the josephson tunneling and mqst in a single bjj have been observed in 2005 @xcite . since then , more progress has been made in studying static , thermal and dynamical properties of the double - well condensate .",
    "experimental investigation of thermal induced phase fluctuations has been reported @xcite .",
    "measurements of the ac and dc josephson effects in bjj have already been realized @xcite .",
    "the bjj system has also been used to perform interference - fringe experiments @xcite and to investigate the crossover from josephson dynamics to hydrodynamics @xcite . in above theoretical studies , the double - well condensate is mainly treated as an isolated system , but actually it is coupled to certain thermal cloud and subject to environmental distortions in experiments . dissipation and noise effects play important roles in understanding properties of bjjs .    the dissipative effect has been studied by several groups @xcite .",
    "it is suggested that the mqst state can be destroyed by energy dissipation @xcite .",
    "possible decoherence caused by dissipation is also discussed @xcite .",
    "it is also shown that dissipation could lead to enhancement of coherence under specific conditions @xcite .    here",
    "we consider a kind of noise effect on the double - well condensate .",
    "noise can be classified as `` internal noise '' or `` external noise '' with respect to its origins @xcite .",
    "internal noise comes from the inside fluctuations of the system , including quantum and thermal fluctuations , or from the exchange symmetry of identical particles @xcite . on the other hand , `` external noise ''",
    "is brought about by fluctuations which are not `` self - originating '' .",
    "it is induced by the coupling between the system and its environment . for cold atomic systems ,",
    "external noise may originate from the magnetic field , laser beams , or other externally applied random driving field .",
    "the present work will focus on this kind of external noise .",
    "a number of theoretical works have been devoted to the influence of external noise on the double - well condensate @xcite .",
    "the noise - induced dephasing @xcite and phase decoherence @xcite have been predicted .",
    "these works based on the two - mode approximation mainly discussed the phase noise .",
    "the phase noise is introduced by coupling a stochastic fluctuations either to the tunnel amplitude or to the number - imbalance operator . in their treatment , spatial information of the external noise is ignored .    the present paper deals with noise due to fluctuations of magnetic field or the optical potential .",
    "we shall consider the time- and space - dependent characteristics of the external noise by solving the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation numerically . in sect .",
    "[ sect : model ] , we describe a noise model in which the noise is simulated by spatially distributed stochastic potentials . the concept of gaussian white noise and the algorithm used to solve the time - dependent gp equation for the double - well condensate are briefly described .",
    "we present in sect .",
    "[ sect : diagram ] the obtained results and discuss the influence of noise on the dynamical behaviors of system .",
    "a brief summary is given in the last section .",
    "we consider the bec confined in a double - well potential is composed of atoms of mass @xmath1 with weakly repulsive interaction .",
    "dynamics of the double - well condensate is obtained by solving the time - dependent gp equation numerically@xcite .",
    "we formulate the external noise by an additional potential of stochastic strength fluctuation in the space .",
    "the external noise is modeled as the gaussian white noise potential @xmath2 , which is space- and time - dependent stochastically .",
    "so @xmath2 satisfies the following equations , @xmath3 and @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes averaging over both the space and the time .",
    "the dirac delta function in the correlation formula makes sure @xmath6 is `` white '' noise , @xmath7 is the fluctuation amplitude of noise potential .",
    "apparently , @xmath7 characterizes the strength or intensity of noise and it can be controlled experimentally .    the noise correlation function in time at a given position is defined as @xmath8 where @xmath9 means that the average is just taken over time . under this definition , @xmath10 must be zero at all given positions . in numerical calculations , @xmath2 is produced as a time - ordered series , @xmath11 , so the time average is performed as @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 is actually a finite number , and @xmath14 is the total time interval with @xmath15 being the step interval of the noise potential series . in our calculations , @xmath16 is already enough to makes sure @xmath17 .",
    "therefore @xmath18 can be used to evaluate the velocity of noise .",
    "faster noise corresponds to smaller @xmath18 .",
    "the general three dimensional time - dependent gp equation provides an exact and fundamental description for our research , which can be formulated as @xmath19\\psi({\\bf r};t),\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the macroscopic wave function at position @xmath21 and time @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the nonlinear interaction with @xmath24 being the @xmath25-wave scattering length .",
    "the external potential @xmath26 consists of the double well @xmath27 and the noise potential @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 fixes the double - well configuration , where @xmath30 is the trap frequencies in the direction of @xmath31 @xcite and @xmath32 is the barrier height .",
    "experimentally , the bose - einstein condensates with repulsive interaction in a quasi-1d symmetric double - well potential can be achieved by splitting one cigar - shaped atomic cloud into two separated aligned cigars by a laser beam .    set the double wells being along the @xmath33 direction and in @xmath34 and @xmath35 directions the strong confinement is exerted ( @xmath36 ) .",

    "[ fig : mqst](b ) , with the participation of noise as weak as @xmath89 , the previous closed orbit has already been becoming very fuzzy .",

    "then it steps into the irregularly energy - fluctuating state .",

    "we have calculated the dynamical behaviors of the double - well condensate subject to gaussian white noise with different strength @xmath107 and change rate @xmath78 .",
    "the noise effect is mainly determined by the strength @xmath107 when the change rate @xmath78 is large enough .",
    "nevertheless , the change rate @xmath78 also plays an important role in understanding the dynamical evolution when @xmath78 is small .",
    "figure  [ fig : r ] displays a typical case of the noise with small strength ( @xmath89 ) and slow change rate ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "the evolution is from an initial state of running phase mqst ( @xmath84=@xmath101 , @xmath71=@xmath104 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : r](b ) looks like fig .",
    "[ fig : running - mqst](b ) , but the evolution time is only within @xmath110 , far shorter that @xmath87 as in fig .  [",

    "the system oscillates in a josephson - like way around the saddle point ( @xmath84=@xmath102 , @xmath71=@xmath0 ) , similar to the case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : running - mqst](c ) .",
    "it seems that decreasing the change rate gives rise to similar effect as increasing the noise strength . the @xmath71-@xmath64 and @xmath112-@xmath64 plots shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : r](e ) and ( f ) provide detailed information of the evolution process .",
    "atoms can be trapped almost in one well for a while and then oscillate between the two wells .",
    "the variation range of @xmath71 is significantly enlarged and many extremely sharp peaks appear in the @xmath71-@xmath64 line .",
    "these peaks indicate that the relative phase can change extremely fast , which may signal that the relative phase is no longer well - defined , as discussed above .",
    "such situation occurs preferently in the large @xmath84 region , as indicated by the almost vertical lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : r](a ) .",
    "this is different from the large @xmath107 case , in which the almost vertical lines appear in the @xmath103 region first .",
    "if the system evolves further , more almost vertical lines appear and they tend to cover the whole phase space in an irregular manner . as a result , it is almost impossible to expect in which state the system is at a given time .",
    "meantime , the energy of the system does not simply tend to damping , but may go up and down occasionally .",
    "so the energy dissipation effect seems smeared out during this stage .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated how an external gaussian white noise affects the dynamics of condensates in double - well .",
    "dynamical evolutions from three typical dynamical regimes of josephson oscillation , @xmath0-mode mqst and running phase mqst are discussed .",
    "it is shown that the system keeps its original dynamical feature for a long time when it is subject to a noise with weak strength and rapid change rate which we called the weak noise . in this case , the noise induced energy dissipation effect is observed .",
    "energy of the system decreases with evolution monotonously in the josephson oscillation regimes , and oscillatorily in the mqst regimes .",
    "the difference between results of the present study and the phenomenological theory is discussed .",

    "if @xmath78 is large enough , the influence of @xmath107 is quite clear .",
    "the larger @xmath107 is , the faster the state evolves and damps .",
