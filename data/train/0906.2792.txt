    "the complete identification of samples of high - energy ( @xmath8 mev ) @xmath0-rays sources remains as one of the outstanding challenges in modern astrophysics .",
    "the main difficulty arises from the limited angular resolution ( from a few arcminutes to degrees ) that can be achieved at gev energies , which allows for multiple candidate counterparts within the @xmath0-ray error circles . overcoming the positional obstacles , the egret instrument @xcite managed to identify blazars and pulsars as the dominant contributors to the @xmath0-ray source population @xcite .",
    "however , despite significant observational efforts , more than half of the sources catalogued by egret remained unidentified @xcite .    during its first months of operation , the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _",
    "( ) has improved the sensitivity and angular resolution achieved by egret , regaling the high - energy community with an improved view of the gev sky @xcite .",
    "of the 205 most significant sources reported in the bright gamma - ray source list ( 0fgl ) , 168 have been associated with blazars , pulsars , high - mass x - ray binaries , radio galaxies , pulsar wind nebulae , supernova remnants , a globular cluster , and the lmc . among the 0fgl sources , 37",
    "have no obvious counterparts at other wavelengths .",
    "multiwavelength observations play a powerful role in the ultimate goal of producing definite identifications for all @xmath0-ray emitters .",
    "in particular , the absence of obvious counterparts for 18% of @xmath0-ray sources in the 0fgl admits the possibility that there are additional types of @xmath0-ray emitters @xcite or even potentially exotic phenomena @xcite .",
    "it is only through dedicated multiwavelength programs that the likelihood of new types of @xmath0-ray emitters can be assessed .",
    "previous multiwavelength studies of @xmath0-ray sources without obvious counterparts have yielded some noteworthy results .",
    "for example , @xcite identified the x - ray counterpart of 3eg j1835 + 5918 as the second member of a much larger population of radio - quiet pulsars that has been recently confirmed by  @xcite .",
    "multiwavelength efforts also suggested the emergence of a class of @xmath0-ray sources associated with radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "building on the improved localizations and sensitivity achieved by _ fermi _ , we have started a dedicated multiwavelength program to investigate the nature of unidentified sources in the 0fgl . in a parallel effort , @xcite suggested a probable association of  source 0fgl j2001.2 + 4352 with a bl lac object . in this letter , we report the association of 0fgl j1830.3 + 0617 , a low galactic latitude source at @xmath9 , listed as having photon flux @xmath10 @xmath11 s@xmath12 above 100  mev , with the flat - spectrum radio quasar ( fsrq ) b1827 + 0617 .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in  2 , we describe multiwavelength observations of b1827 + 0617 . in ",
    "3 we discuss the implications of our results .",

    "the bright source corresponds to nvss j183005.90 + 061916.4 ( b1827 + 0617 ) .",
    "the field is @xmath13 . ]",
    "a number of archival radio observations have covered the field of 0fgl j1830.3 + 0617 .",
    "an examination of the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) source catalog reveals only one source within the 95% confidence level radius derived by .",
    "nvss j183005.90 + 061916.4 is listed as an unresolved source of flux density 397 mjy at 1.4 ghz @xcite . in order to provide a map of the entire field",
    ", we generated a radio finding chart from the 1995 february 27 vla observation using the postage stamp image server available on the nvss world wide web .",
    "figure  [ radio ] shows the 1.4 ghz image and the localization of nvss j183005.90 + 061916.4 within the  error circle .",
    "a corresponding source gb6 j1830 + 0619 ( b1827 + 0617 herein ) was also detected with a flux density of 443 mjy at 4.85 ghz in the green bank 4.85 ghz northern sky survey carried out during 1986 november and 1987 october @xcite .",
    "we accordingly estimate a spectral index @xmath1 between 1.4 and 4.85 ghz , defined as @xmath14 . given the resulting spectral index ,",
    "we classify b1827 + 0617 as a flat - spectrum ( @xmath15 ) radio source .      the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) on board the  observatory @xcite observed the field of 0fgl j1830.3 + 0617 on 2009 may 20 ut for a total of 580  s of useful exposure in photon counting ( pc ) mode . for the data reduction , we used grades 012 and version 3.3 of the  software .",
    "as in the radio observations , a single source , swift j1830.1 + 0619 , was detected with _ xrtcentroid _ within the  error circle at ( j2000.0 ) r.a.=@xmath16 , decl.=@xmath17 with a 6  uncertainty , consistent with the position of b1827 + 0617 .",
    "x - ray counts were extracted from a circular region with a 20 pixel radius ( 47 ) .",
    "the background was extracted from a source - free region with similar radius .",
    "the count rate obtained from the observation is @xmath18 s@xmath12 .",
    "although the source contains only 31 photons , swift j1830.1 + 0619 is detected at a 5.5 @xmath19 level of significance . because of the limited number of photons detected , no spectral",
    "fitting was attempted .",
    "using webpimms , we estimate an absorbed flux in the 0.310 kev band of @xmath20 erg @xmath11 s@xmath12 assuming a power law spectrum with @xmath21 and a galactic column density @xmath22 = @xmath23 @xmath11 as obtained from the nh tool .",
    "we note that @xmath22 is consistent with galactic absorption derived assuming an optical extinction @xmath24 @xcite and the standard conversion @xmath25 @xmath11 mag@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "optical identification of b1827 + 0617 was made during 2009 may 25 and may 29 ut using the retrocam imager @xcite mounted on the mdm 2.4 m hiltner telescope .",
    "images in sloan @xmath26 were taken , and the @xmath27-band image is shown figure  [ photo ] .",
    "magnitudes were measured using a @xmath28 radius aperture centered at the optical position of the object at coordinates ( j2000.0 ) r.a.=@xmath29 , decl.=@xmath30 in the usno - b1.0 astrometric system .",
    "an approximate @xmath31 magnitude was derived using usno magnitudes of nearby stars . in this system , stars a and b in figure  [ photo ] have @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .    on both nights ,",
    "b1827 + 0617 was found at @xmath3 .",
    "it is clear that this is brighter by at least 2 magnitudes in comparison with any of the palomar sky survey plates obtained in 1950 , 1990 , and 1993 .",
    "visual inspection shows that b1827 + 0617 was definitely fainter than star b on the digitized sky survey image from the 1993 may 27 plate , also shown in figure  [ photo ] .",
    "therefore , reporting here a @xmath34 mag high state in 2009 is rather conservative .",
    "mag @xcite .",
    "the single emission line mg ii @xmath35 at @xmath5 is indicated . ]    in addition to the optical imaging , we used the boller & chivens ccd spectrograph ( ccds ) mounted on the mdm 2.4 m telescope to acquire spectra of b1827 + 0617 .",
    "the setup used provides 3.1   pixel@xmath12 dispersion and @xmath36    resolution with a @xmath37 slit .",
    "observations consisted of three 1200 s integrations obtained on 2009 may 25 ut under photometric conditions .",
    "the spectra were processed using standard procedures in iraf and a final spectrum was generated by combining the three individual exposures .",
    "the wavelength scale was established by fitting a set of polynomials to xe lamp spectra .",
    "a hg - ne lamp was also used to verify the wavelength calibration . finally ,",
    "we derived the flux calibration from observations of the spectrophotometric standard feige 34 @xcite observed at comparable telescope pointing to b1827 + 0617 .",
    "galactic reddening is a significant factor in this line of sight at galactic coordinates @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , we produced a final dereddened spectrum using an extinction correction of @xmath39 for these coordinates derived from the dust maps of @xcite .",
    "figure  [ spectrum ] shows the resulting dereddened , wavelength- and flux - calibrated spectrum of b1827 + 0617 .",
    "a single weak emission line at 4892   can be identified with @xmath4 at a redshift of @xmath5 by process of elimination , considering other expected qso emission lines that are not seen for alternative identifications .",
    "in addition , the weak , broad shelf to the red of , with a maximum at 5600  , is due to the blend of multiplets that commonly contribute to the feature known as the small blue bump in qso spectra . as is often the case in blazars , these and other emission lines may become more prominent in the spectrum when the continuum declines to a low state .",
    "a typical @xmath0-ray error circle contains several radio and x - ray sources to contend with .",
    "the field of 0fgl j1830.3 + 0617 is rather simple in that a single radio / x - ray source , b1827 + 0617 , emerges as the only counterpart candidate .",
    "optical photometry shows that b1827 + 0617 is at least 2 magnitudes brighter than its historical level as seen on sky survey plates .",
    "interestingly , there is also evidence for variability of 0fgl j1830.3 + 0617 in  observations between 2008 august 4 and 2008 october 30 @xcite .",
    "multiwavelength variability and periods of enhanced activity are typically observed in @xmath0-ray blazars @xcite .    turning our attention to the radio band ,",
    "archival measurements indicate a spectral index of @xmath1 between 1.4 and 4.85 ghz . in order to compare the radio properties of b1827 + 0617 with proposed blazar associations in the 0fgl @xcite , we culled measurements from the green bank ( gb6 ) catalog at 4.85 ghz @xcite , the 4.85 ghz parkes - mit - nrao ( pmn ) survey catalogue @xcite , and the 1.4 ghz nvss catalog @xcite . for sources classified as blazars @xcite ,",
    "flux densities were assembled and a spectral index @xmath40 ( where @xmath14 ) computed between 1.4 and 4.85 ghz .",
    "we show in figure  [ population ] the radio spectral index distribution as a function of the flux density at 4.85 ghz for 100  blazars . clearly , the results indicate that the radio properties of b1827 + 0617 are in accord with the flux densities and flat spectral indices of typical blazars .",

    "the association of b1827 + 0617 with 0fgl j1830.3 + 0617 is further supported by the optical spectrum of b1827 + 0617 , which indicates a redshift @xmath5 .",
    "the presence of a single emission line in the optical spectrum accompanied by a flat - spectrum radio spectral index is consistent with a fsrq blazar .",
    "statistically , as many blazars are expected to be located near the galactic plane as anywhere else @xcite .",
    "indeed , by extrapolation ,  should detect 20@xmath725 blazars at @xmath42 @xcite .",

    "crates @xcite , or cgrabs @xcite catalogs was most likely missed because such surveys only aim for uniform sky coverage at @xmath46 .",
    "we anticipate that several additional `` unidentified ''  sources at low galactic latitude can be associated with known flat - spectrum radio sources . among our proposed identifications ( figure  [ figure5 ] ) are 0fgl j0643.2 + 0858 = pmn j0643 + 0857 @xcite , 0fgl j1326.6@xmath75302 = pmn j1326@xmath75256 and 0fgl j1328.8@xmath75604 = pmn j1329@xmath75608 @xcite .",

    "we have argued that the b1827 + 0617 is most likely associated with 0fgl j1830.3 + 0617 .",
    "a blazar identification of the  source is supported by its flat spectral index between 1.4 and 4.85 ghz , as well as the detection of optical/@xmath0-ray variability .",
    "the optical spectrum of b1827 + 0617 has a single emission line that we identify with @xmath35 at @xmath5 , which supports a fsrq blazar classification for this source .",
    "the radio properties of b1827 + 0617 are compatible with known  blazars in the 0fgl .",
    "these findings suggest that the proposed blazar association is largely secure .",
    "additional identifications of  blazars at low galactic latitude with known radio sources can proceed in the same manner as for high - latitude sources .",
    "ultimately , the unequivocal identification of @xmath0-ray blazars will depend strongly on the detection of contemporaneous variability in @xmath0 rays and at least one additional energy band .",
    "independent of the @xmath0-ray strategies , it is crucial to move ahead with dedicated multiwavelength programs of both identified and unidentified  sources .",
    "these efforts may prove successful in sorting out the presence of novel classes of @xmath0-ray emitters .",
    "such multiwavelength studies will increase in complexity as the  mission continues to unveil the full distribution of gev sources in the sky to even fainter flux levels ."
