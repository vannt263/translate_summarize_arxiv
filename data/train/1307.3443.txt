    "this leads to a cigar - shaped trapping potential whose parameters have been precisely determined in @xcite by measurements of the level spacings between the lowest trap levels and wkb calculations . in a harmonic approximation",
    "we obtain trap frequencies of @xmath48khz @xcite in radial direction and @xmath49khz @xcite in axial direction . for a harmonic trap with such an aspect ratio of @xmath50:@xmath511:10 a two - particle system can be well described by mapping it onto a true 1d system @xcite .",
    "the value of the corresponding 1d coupling constant @xmath52 is determined by the 3d scattering length @xmath53 and by the harmonic oscillator length of the radial confinement @xmath54 as @xmath55 where @xmath56@xmath57@xmath58=@xmath59 ... and @xmath60 is the riemann zeta function @xcite . in our experiment",

    "s1 ) . for most of our measurements we use initial systems where the majority component consists of atoms in state @xmath64 and an impurity atom in state @xmath62 . to create these systems we start by preparing non - interacting imbalanced few fermion samples of a single atom in state @xmath62 and @xmath65 atoms in state @xmath66 as described in @xcite with a preparation fidelity of @xmath67 . to convert these into @xmath62-@xmath68 samples",
    "we then perform an rf landau - zener passage which drives the atoms from state @xmath63 to state @xmath64 .",
    "this has a transfer efficiency of @xmath69 per atom which results in a combined preparation fidelity of the non - interacting @xmath62-@xmath64 sample @xmath70 .    to introduce interactions between the minority atom and the majority component",
    "we ramp the magnetic field away from the zero crossings of @xmath9 to the values given in table s4 . at these larger interactions",
    "we observe some loss of atoms due to relaxation to lower energy states which increases with coupling strength and atom number @xcite . to obtain an upper bound for the loss probability we measure the loss in a sample with @xmath71 and obtain a loss probability @xmath72 for strongest interaction .",
    "therefore we obtain a lower bound for the combined fidelity to prepare an interacting ( @xmath38)-particle system of @xmath73 . for systems with @xmath74",
    "the preparation fidelity of the initial sample is considerably lower and the stability of the sample is significantly reduced which inhibits reliable results of the rf spectroscopy .",

    "@xmath62 , @xmath75 and @xmath64 .      in the presence of a confining potential",
    "the energy eigenstates of the system are discrete .",
    "therefore the spectrum consists of discrete transitions between the different energy levels .",
    "however if the resolution @xmath76 is lower than the difference between close - lying levels the excitation spectrum appears as a continuous spectrum ( see fig .",
    "examples for this regime  where almost all rf measurements with ultracold atoms have been performed so far  can be found in @xcite . in this case",
    "the measured rf spectrum has a characteristic line shape whose form depends on the excitation spectrum of the system .",
    "s2 b illustrates the case where @xmath77 is comparable to the level spacing which has been achieved in @xcite . in our experiment",
    "we are in the sideband resolved regime where the rf resolution is much higher than the level spacing and the transitions between different trap states are well separated ( see fig .",
    "s2 c and d ) .",
    "therefore the determined interaction energies are insensitive to saturation effects which only affect the relative height of the different trap sidebands . by precisely measuring the relative height of these sidebands",
    "one could in future experiments determine for example the effective mass of the polaron - like state .",
    "to determine the interaction energy of our systems we use the fact that it is possible to change the hyperfine state of our atoms with an rf - field whose frequency is resonant with the energy splitting of the initial and final state .",
    "for a non - interacting system ( i.e. a system with no majority atoms ) this transition frequency is the zeeman splitting of the two states given by the breit - rabi formula ( see fig .",
    "s1 ) which we label the free - free transition frequency @xmath17 .",

    "depending on the applied rf frequency we either drive the transition to the non - interacting ground state ( left blue peak ) or to the next accessible excited state which is separated by @xmath78 ( right blue peak ) . to resolve this sideband we increased the power of the rf pulse by 16db and the duration of the pulse by a factor of @xmath79 .    to determine the free - free transition frequency @xmath17 we measure the fraction of transferred atoms as a function of the frequency of the applied rf pulse .",
    "to do this we prepare spin polarized samples of about @xmath80 atoms in state @xmath63 , apply the rf pulse , remove all atoms which are not in state @xmath63 from the trap and count the number of remaining atoms @xcite .",
    "the width of this transition  and therefore the resolution of our energy measurement  is determined by the stability of the magnetic offset field and the fourier limit of the rf pulse . as described in @xcite the magnetic field stability of our experimental setup",
    "is @xmath81 mg , which corresponds to a frequency shift of about @xmath82hz for the @xmath83-@xmath75 transition and about @xmath84hz for the @xmath75-@xmath85 transition . to reduce decoherence and dephasing effects",
    "we choose a short rf pulse with a duration of @xmath86ms .",
    "this results in a total measured fwhm of @xmath87hz .",
    "the power of the rf pulse is chosen such that we transfer about @xmath88 of the population to the final state .",
    "achieving a transferred fraction of @xmath88 for the single impurity in an interacting system requires about @xmath89db more rf - power .    to measure the frequency shift for the weakly interacting system we start from an interacting @xmath83-@xmath85 system at @xmath90 g ( @xmath19 ) , drive the minority particle from state @xmath91 to state @xmath63 and then detect the number of transferred minority atoms using the same method as described above",
    "we take spectra for different numbers of majority atoms and extract the transition frequency from a gaussian fit . to check for slow drifts of the magnetic field we measure the free - free transition before and after each measurement of the interaction energy and use the weighted mean of both free - free transition frequencies .",
    "the error of the interaction shift is then determined by quadratic addition of the errors of the gaussian fits to the spectra and the standard error of the mean of the two measurements of the free - free transition @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty of the interaction strength is dominated by the error of the transversal harmonic oscillator length @xmath92 .",
    "additionally , the interaction strength of the final state is not exactly zero ( @xmath93 ) at the chosen magnetic field of @xmath94 g and hence we add this difference to the error of @xmath9 . compared to these errors the influence of the uncertainty of the magnetic field on @xmath9 is negligible    to obtain the interaction energy of a strongly interacting system we perform a measurement at a magnetic field of @xmath95 g where a @xmath75-@xmath85 system has the same interaction strength as the @xmath91-@xmath85 system at @xmath90 g .",
    "this allows us to determine the interaction energy of the @xmath83-@xmath85 system at @xmath95 g ( corresponding to @xmath96 ) by measuring the energy difference of the @xmath83-@xmath85 and @xmath75-@xmath85 systems and adding the previously determined interaction energy of the weakly interacting system .",
    "an illustration of this two - step process is given in fig .",
    "s3 . for this measurement",
    "the error of @xmath9 is given by the sum of the errors of @xmath9 resulting from the uncertainty of the transversal harmonic oscillator length and the small mismatch between the coupling strengths of the weakly interacting systems which we use as initial and final states .",
    "to determine the interaction energy of a system with intermediate interaction ( @xmath97 ) we perform a similar two - step process indicated by the orange arrows in fig .",

    "given is the correction factor by which we multiply our measured interaction energy to compare them to the true 1d theories @xcite . for the weakly interacting system we neglect this correction because it is smaller than @xmath98 which is below the resolution of our rf - spectroscopy . for intermediate ( strong ) interactions we have numerical results up to n=2 ( n=3 ) , which we use to calculate the ratio between the interaction energy of a true one - dimensional system and a system with a finite aspect ratio of @xmath99 . for larger numbers of majority atoms we approximate the correction factor by the result of the @xmath43 ( @xmath100 ) system .    due to the finite aspect ratio of our quasi 1d trap our measured interaction energy deviates from the one in a true 1d system .",
    "we estimate this contribution by comparing the calculations for a quasi 1d system ( aspect ratio @xmath50:@xmath511:10 ) and a true 1d system ( @xmath50:@xmath511:@xmath101 ) which is shown in table s6 . for weak interactions",
    "the correction is significantly smaller than the error of the measurement of the interaction energy and hence is not considered .",
    "however , for our measurements at intermediate and strong interactions this contribution has been found to be as large as @xmath102 and can therefore not be neglected @xcite . as we compare our measurement with theories for true 1d systems , we correct our data by the ratio between the quasi one - dimensional and the true one - dimensional system . to our knowledge precise numerical calculations for both the true 1d and the quasi 1d system only exist for systems with a number of majority atoms up to @xmath100 . from these calculations @xcite we can determine a correction which is on the order of @xmath102 of the interaction energy for a strongly interacting system with @xmath100 .",
    "for @xmath103 we expect the correction to be larger , however as can be seen from the corrections for strongly interacting systems for @xmath104 in table s6 the increase of the correction as a function of particle number gets smaller for larger particle numbers .",
    "hence we approximate the relative correction for a strongly interacting system with @xmath103 by the relative correction of a system with @xmath100 . as for lower interaction strength",
    "the corrections are smaller we can approximate the relative corrections for systems with intermediate interaction and @xmath105 by that of a system with @xmath43 .    * * _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * * f. serwane , et al .",
