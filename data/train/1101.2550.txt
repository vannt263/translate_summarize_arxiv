    "historically , the well - known einstein , podolsky , and rosen ( epr ) paradox  @xcite concerning the completeness of quantum mechanics was proposed based on a gedanken experiment in 1935 .",
    "epr claimed that quantum mechanics is incomplete and so - called local hidden variables ( lhv ) should exist .",
    "subsequently , it has provoked much debate on the completeness of quantum mechanics and the existence of lhv theories . in 1964 , bell actually quantified the epr argument and derived a strict inequality  @xcite with respect to the correlation strengths possible to achieve by all the lhv models .",
    "if this inequality is violated , then there are no lhv and the quantum mechanical prediction of the existence of quantum nonlocal correlation ( i.e. , entanglement ) is sustained .",
    "however , bell s seminal inequality did not allow for the practically - existing imperfections and thus was not accessible to the experimental tests .",
    "soon later , clauser , horne , shimony and holt ( chsh ) addressed this issue and derived an experimentally testable inequality  @xcite . during the past decades ,",
    "a number of experimental tests of chsh - type bell s inequality have been reported using , e.g. , entangled photon pairs  @xcite , trapped ions  @xcite , an atom and a photon  @xcite , two superconducting phase qubits  @xcite , and even two entangled degrees of freedom ( comprising spatial and spin components ) of single neutrons  @xcite , and so on .",
    "these experimental evidences strongly convince that bell s inequality could be violated and thus agree well with quantum mechanical predictions , ruling out the lhv theories .",
    "recently , a novel superconducting electrical circuit architecture ( called circuit qed ) analogous to cavity qed has been first suggested by blais et al .",
    "@xcite , and then realized in the experiment by wallraff et al.@xcite . in circuit qed , a superconducting qubit is strongly coupled to one - dimensional transmission line resonator ( tlr ) which acts as quantized cavity .",
    "now much attention has been focused on this field because it opens the possibility of studying quantum optics phenomena in solid - state system and quantum information processing .",
    "experimentally , remarkable advances have been achieved such as : observation of the vacuum rabi splittings  @xcite and ac stack shifts  @xcite , observing berry s phase  @xcite , measuring the lamb shifts  @xcite , generations of microwave single photons  @xcite and fock states  @xcite , coupling two qubits via cavity as quantum bus  @xcite , two - qubit grover and deutsch - jozsa algorithms  @xcite , etc . in this system",
    "the qubit - state readouts were achieved by detecting the state - dependent shifts of the frequency of the dispersively - coupled resonator  @xcite .",
    "indeed , in the dispersive regime  @xcite , the transition frequencies of the superconducting qubits are far detuned from the frequency of the coupled resonator . as a consequence",
    ", a sufficiently large state - dependent frequency shifts of the resonator can be induced  @xcite , which could be tested by measuring the transmission spectra of the driven resonator .",
    "very recently , an efficient approach to implement the joint spectral measurements of the multi - qubits has been proposed by detecting the transmission spectra of the common resonator  @xcite . by considering all the quantum correlation of qubits and resonator ( i.e. , beyond the usual coarse - grained / mean - field approximation )",
    ", it is shown that each peak in the measured transmission spectra of the driven resonator marks one of the logic states and the relative height of such a peak is related to its corresponding superposed probability . with these joint spectral measurements , huang et al .",
    ",  @xcite presented a high efficiency tomographic reconstructions of more than one - qubit quantum states .",
    "as another application , in this paper we discuss how the proposed joint spectral measurements can be further utilized to test bell s inequality with an experimentally - demonstrated two - qubit circuit qed system . compared with the previous schemes for testing bell inequalities , the advantage of the present proposal is that , the desirable coincided measurements on the two qubits can be directly implemented by the suitably - designed joint spectral measurements .",
    "this is because the states of the two qubits jointly determine the frequency shifts and consequently the spectral distributions of the driven resonator .",
    "therefore , the nonlocal correlations between the well - separated qubits can be directly read out by analyzing the measured transmission spectra of the driven resonator .",
    "we note in passing that none of the circuit qed proposals so far can be used to close the locality loophole .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we propose a method to deterministically generate an ideal bell state with the experimentally - demonstrated circuit qed system , via an _",
    "i_swap gate assisted by several single - qubit gates  @xcite .",
    "further , a simple quantum interference method , instead of the usual quantum - state tomographic reconstruction , is proposed to confirm such a preparation by coherent quantum operations and projective measurements on two qubits in the computational basis . in section iii , we discuss how to utilize the joint spectral measurements to implement this confirmation .",
    "importantly , by applying two individual hadamard - like operations to encode the local variables @xmath2 into the generated bell state , we show that the statistical correlations between the distant qubits can be read out by these spectral measurements for various typical sets of classical local variables @xmath3 . with these measured correlations the chsh - type bell s",
    "inequality can be tested .",
    "discussion and conclusion are presented in section iv .",
    "in this section , we will show how to deterministically prepare one of the ideal bell states @xmath4 )  @xcite @xmath5.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath6 is the single - mode frequency of the tlr , @xmath7 its creation ( annihilation ) operator ; @xmath8 the transition frequency of @xmath9th scq that can be adjusted by external bias flux and @xmath10 the coupling strength of the @xmath9th scq to the resonator .",
    "finally , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "two scqs in this circuit can be controlled and measured by driving the resonator .",
    "the hamiltonian to describe such a drive is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is time - independent real amplitude and @xmath16 the frequency of the externally applied drive .",
    "from the easily - prepared initial state @xmath17 , an ideal bell state can be generated deterministically by the following three steps , the corresponding gate sequence is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "from the initial state @xmath17.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] +    _ step 1 _ : perform the unitary operation @xmath18 on each scq to prepare the superposition of two basis states of each scq .",
    "that is , @xmath19 the unitary operations @xmath20 and @xmath21 can be achieved by externally applied microwave drives with the duration of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively  @xcite . here , @xmath24 is the detuning between the drive frequency and the resonator one .    _",
    "step 2 _ : in the dispersive regime , i.e.,@xmath25 and @xmath26 ( with @xmath27 being the detuning between the @xmath9th scq and the tlr ) , and @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( achieved by adjusting the external bias flux ) , the efficient hamiltonian of this system reads @xmath30.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this hamiltonian generates a two - qubit gate ( with the evolution duration @xmath31 ) @xmath32 where @xmath33 with @xmath34 being the mean photon number in the resonator .",
    "if @xmath35 is known in advance , the global phase factor @xmath36 can be eliminated by performing single - qubit phase rotations : @xmath37 and @xmath38 , on each qubit .",
    "then , the above two - qubit gate reduces to the desirable @xmath39swap gate @xmath40 note that no external microwave drive is applied in this step . with such an _ i_swap gate ,",
    "the entanglement between two scqs is generated , i.e. , @xmath41    _ step 3 _ : apply the unitary operation @xmath42 to the first scq for generating a desirable bell state @xmath43 from the state @xmath44 prepared above , i.e. , latexmath:[\\ ] ]    thirdly , the correlation between two classical variables @xmath2 is measured by the difference in the probabilities of two qubits found in the same and different logic states .",
    "this means that the correlation function @xmath86 can be obtained as @xmath87 where @xmath88(@xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 ) denotes the probability of two qubits found in the logic state @xmath17(@xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 ) .",
    "theoretically , the correlation of two classical variables @xmath2 can be described by the operator @xmath95 and thus the correlation function is calculated as @xmath96 thus , for the set of classical local variables @xmath97 , the so - called chsh function  @xcite reads @xmath98 typically , for one set of classical local variables @xmath99 , the chsh function  @xcite is calculated as @xmath100 obviously , the chsh - type bell s inequality  @xcite @xmath101 is violated . while , for another set of classical local variables @xmath102",
    ", the chsh function  @xcite is @xmath103 therefore , in this case the chsh - type bell s inequality  @xcite @xmath101 is violated maximally .",
    "the above theoretical predictions can be numerically tested by the experimental joint spectral measurements .",
    "indeed , the correlation function in eq .",
    "( 15 ) can be directly calculated from the measured transmission spectra of the driven resonator .     for the state @xmath104 with one set of classical local variables @xmath105 .",
    "( a)-(d ) : the correlation functions can be directly calculated , ( @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , according to eq .",
    "the parameters are are the same as that in fig .",
    "3.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] +    for example , for the set of classical local variables @xmath99 , fig .",
    "4 shows the relevant transmission spectra ( corresponding to the state @xmath104 ) versus the detuning of @xmath82 . here",
    ", the parameters are chosen as @xmath110mhz  @xcite . with the fig .",
    "4(a)-(d ) , the correlation functions between two classical local variables can be directly calculated ( @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath111 .",
    "thus the chsh function  @xcite is calculated as @xmath112 this indicates that the chsh - type bell s inequality  @xcite @xmath101 is violated .     for the state @xmath104 with another set of classical local variables @xmath113 .",

    "again , from the fig .",
    "5(a)-(d ) the correlation functions are directly calculated as ( @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath114 . as a consequence",
    ", we easily obtain the chsh function  @xcite : @xmath115 obviously , the chsh - type bell s inequality  @xcite @xmath101 is significantly violated .    finally , we emphasize that compared with the previous schemes for testing bell s inequality ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) with superconducting qubits , the present proposal seems much simpler and easier to be experimentally realized .",
    "we discuss its advantages next .",
    "we now briefly address the experimental feasibility of our scheme . with the typical experimental parameters ( @xmath116)=2@xmath117(6.442 , 4.5 , 4.85 , 0.133)ghz  @xcite and the amplitude of the drive chosen as @xmath15=2@xmath1171.2ghz",
    ", we can approximately estimate the time needed in our scheme . the required times for realizing the unitary operatons @xmath118 , @xmath119 ( setting @xmath1204.491ghz to satisfy @xmath121 ) , @xmath122 ( setting @xmath1204ghz ) , an @xmath39swap gate ( setting @xmath123ghz ) are @xmath124=1.5ns , @xmath125=4.5ns , @xmath126=1.5ns , and @xmath127=50ns , respectively .",
    "experimentally , the time interval for performing a joint spectral measurement introduced above is about 40ns  @xcite .",
    "thus , the times for generating a bell state and confirming its existence are about @xmath128ns and @xmath129ns , respectively . also , the time interval for testing bell s inequality can be estimated as @xmath130ns . finally , the total time in our scheme to perform a test experiment is about @xmath131ns , which is still shorter than the qubit s relaxation and dephasing times , e.g. , @xmath132=7.3@xmath133s and @xmath134=500ns  @xcite .",
    "it is clear , however , that this is not enough to close the locality loophole .",
    "therefore , our proposal should be experimentally realized with the current techniques .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have proposed a simple and feasible method to test bell s inequality with experimentally - demonstrated circuit qed system by joint spectral measurements . at first , an alternative method to generate an ideal bell state is proposed with an @xmath39swap gate and several single - qubit gates  @xcite .",
    "then we present a simple method to confirm the generation of the bell state with two single - qubit unitary operations and two projective measurements on two qubits . with the experimental joint spectral measurements ,",
    "the confirmation can be easily achieved .",
    "further , with two hadamard - like operations constructed with single - qubit gates  @xcite , two classical variables @xmath2 can be encoded into the generated bell state . for the typical sets of classical local variables @xmath3",
    ", the correlation functions in bell s inequality can be directly read out by joint spectral measurements because each detected peak marks one of the logics states and its relative height corresponds to the superposed probability in the detected two - qubit states . in this way , the bell s inequality",
    "could be efficiently tested .",
    "compared with the previous schemes for testing bell s inequality , the advantage of our proposal is that the desirable coincided measurements on the two qubits can be directly realized by joint spectral measurements and the nonlocal correlations between the distant qubits can be directly read out from the measured transmission spectra of the driven resonator . as a result , the present proposal seems much simpler and easier to be experimentally realized by joint spectral measurements .",
    "we believe that our method could be generalized to test bell - like inequalities for multi - qubit states in a straightforward way .",
