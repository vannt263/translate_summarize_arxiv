    "parrondo s paradox consists of a sequence of games , individually each of which are losing games but provide a winning outcome when played in a deterministic or random order .",
    "it has been shown that parrondo s games have important applications in many physical and biological systems[- ] .",
    "quantum version of parrondo s games were introduced in refs.[- ] .",
    "quantum version of the classical random walk on other hand was introduced in 1993 in ref .",
    "[ ] . in refs.[- ]",
    "parrondo s games are explored using 1-d discrete time quantum walk(dtqw ) .",
    "when a game is played , the net expectation of position of the walker defines a win or a loss .",
    "it has been already shown that quantum walk version of parrondo s paradox does not exist in the asymptotic limits @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the need for studying parrondo s games via quantum walks is necessitated by the search for applications in building better algorithms@xcite and to explain physical process like quantum ratchets@xcite .",
    "our motivation in this work is to implement a genuine parrondo s paradox via quantum walk .",
    "we show that while previous attempts at implementing parrondo s paradox with quantum walks failed in asymptotic limits@xcite-@xcite our method using two coin initial states gives a genuine parrondo s paradox even in the asymptotic limits .",
    "+ parrondo s game as originally introduced in refs.@xcite is a gambling game .",
    "a player plays against a bank with a choice of two games @xmath0 and @xmath1 , whose outcomes are determined by the toss of biased coins .",
    "each of these games is losing when played in isolation but when played alternately or in some other deterministic or random sequence ( such as @xmath2 , etc . )",
    "can become a winning game .",
    "owing to this counter - intuitive nature , parrondo s games are also referred to as parrondo s paradox .",
    "the apparent paradox that two losing games @xmath0 and @xmath1 can produce a winning outcome when played in an alternating sequence was originally devised by juan m. r. parrondo as a pedagogical illustration of the brownian ratchet@xcite .",
    "parrondo s games have important applications in many physical and biological systems , _ e.g. , _ in control theory - the random / deterministic combination of two unstable systems can produce a overall stable system@xcite .",
    "the 1-d discrete time quantum walk implementation of parrondo s paradox is as follows : consider two games a and b alternately played according to time .",
    "game a and b are represented by different quantum operators @xmath3 and @xmath4 ,    @xmath5    the initial state of the quantum walker is @xmath6 where first ket refers to the position space and second ket refers to the single coin space which is initially in a superposition of heads and tails .",
    "the shift in the position space , say from @xmath7 to @xmath8 or @xmath9 , is defined by a unitary operator called shift operator(@xmath10 ) defined as , @xmath11 games _ a _ and _ b _ are played alternately in different time steps , i.e. , game _ a _ is played on time steps @xmath12 and game _ b _ is played on time steps @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the period and @xmath15 is an integer . the evolution operator can be written as : @xmath16 and the final state after @xmath17 steps is given by @xmath18 . for @xmath19 , it means we play games with the time sequence @xmath20 as denoted in fig .",
    "[ fig : win - loss ] , after @xmath17 steps , if the probability @xmath21 of the walker to be found to the right of the origin , is greater than the probability @xmath22 to be found to the left of the origin , i.e. , @xmath23 , we consider the player to win .",
    "similarly , if @xmath24 , the player losses .",
    "if @xmath25 , it means the player neither loses nor wins , it s a draw . by making use of the above scheme",
    ", parrondo s games using 1-d dtqw are formulated .",
    "we use @xmath26 to indicate the player win or lose and not expectation value of position because as already shown in refs.@xcite expectation value may be positive but @xmath26 may ybe negative this would be an absurd result .",
    "the game is constructed with two losing games _ a _ and _ b _ having two different biased coin operators @xmath27 and @xmath28 , if we set @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 as in fig.[game](a ) .",
    "we form a game with sequences _ @xmath32_.",
    "this results in winning at the beginning but in the asymptotic limit the player will lose as in fig.[game](b ) , one can check for different sequences like _ @xmath33 etc . _ and in all cases in the asymptotic limits we lose .",
    "hence parrondo s paradox does not exist in case of 1-d dtqw .",
    "this fact was noted in refs .",
    "@xcite also .",
    "in particular , ref .",
    "@xcite shows with many different sequences like abab .. , aabaab .. , etc , in asymptotic limits there is no parrondo s paradox .",
    "hence our motivation to find circumstances for the existence of a genuine parrondo s paradox in quantum walks .",
    "as in the previous section , the elements of our two coin quantum walk are the walker , coins , evolution operators for both the coins , walker and a set of observables .",
    "the walker is a quantum system with its position denoted as @xmath34 residing in a hilbert space of infinite but countable dimension @xmath35 .",
    "the basis states @xmath36 which span @xmath35 , and any superposition of the form @xmath37 which are subject to @xmath38 , are valid states for the walker @xcite . the walker is usually initialized at the origin , i.e. , @xmath39 .",
    "the two coin initial state is a quantum system in a 4-d hilbert space @xmath40 .",
    "we denote the two coin initial state as @xmath41 , which may or may not be entangled- @xmath42 and has the form : @xmath43 evolution operators used are unitary as before and since the coin is a bipartite system , the coin is defined as the tensor product of two single - qubit coin operators : @xmath44 , where @xmath45,@xmath46 can be any of the game @xmath0 and @xmath1 . the evolution operator is fully separable , thus any entanglement in the coins is due to the initial states used .",
    "the conditional shift operator @xmath47 allows the walker to move either forward or backward , depending on the state of the coin .",
    "the operator @xmath48 incorporates the stochastic behavior of the random walk with a two coin initial state .",
    "it is only when the coin is in the @xmath49 or @xmath50 state that the walker moves either forward or backward else the walker does not move .",
    "the full evolution operator has the structure @xmath51 and one can mathematically represent a two coin quantum walk after @xmath17 steps as @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes the initial state of the walker and the coins . as defined before , winning and losing in context of parrondo s game , after @xmath17 time steps",
    "if the probability @xmath54 of the walker to be found to the right of the origin is greater than the probability to be found left of the origin , i.e. , @xmath55 we consider the player to win .",
    "however if , @xmath56 then the player loses and if @xmath57 it implies a draw . in order to obtain a genuine parrondo s paradox",
    "the two games @xmath0 and @xmath1 are now played on the two coin space as follows : @xmath58 is operated on the two coins and in the next step @xmath59 is played on the two coins .",
    "thus , for the first coin we have the series @xmath60 while on the second coin we have @xmath61 .",
    "the coin operators can as before be defined as- @xmath62 @xmath63    and are played alternately in time , i.e , in sequence @xmath64 and the plot for @xmath65 as shown in fig.[result](a ) is obtained .",
    "it is evident that the sequence @xmath64 provides a winning outcome for two losing games even in asymptotic limits .",
    "the fact that individually the sequence @xmath66 on first coin and @xmath67 on second coin give a losing outcome can be seen from @xmath26 plot in fig.[result](b ) .",
    "from fig.[result ] we can conclude that one can obtain a genuine parrondo s paradox with a non - entangled or a partially entangled two coin state using quantum walks . when a single coin was considered from fig.[game ] the outcome of parrondo s games did not give rise to the paradox in the asymptotic limit . in order to obtain a genuine parrondo s paradox ,",
    "what is needed is a two - coin state .",
    "maximally entangled coins lead to a draw as the probability distribution is perfectly symmetric as noted before in ref.@xcite , on the other hand non - entangled or partially entangled coins lead to a parrondo s paradox .",
    "further , in fig .  [ concur ] , we plot the amount of entanglement present in a quantum system , i.e. , the concurrence@xcite .",
    "the concurrence is zero for a separable state and one for a maximally entangled state .",
    "fig.[concur ] shows the concurrence for our arbitrary two coin state as a function of @xmath68 .",
    "one sees that parrondo s paradox is observed for @xmath69 and @xmath70 with the definition as in fig .  1 .",
    "in the region @xmath71 there is a role reversal and thus our definition for parrondo s paradox as used in fig .",
    "1 is also reversed .",
    "( red , solid ) for abab .. on first coin and baba ... on second coin , and finally @xmath72 ( red , dashed ) for aaaa .. on first coin and bbbb ... on second coin .",
    "note that parrondo s paradox is observed for @xmath69 and @xmath70 with the definition as in fig .  1 . in the region",
    "@xmath71 there is a role reversal and thus our definition for parrondo s paradox as used in fig .  1 is also reversed . ]",
    "our goal in this work was to show evidence of a genuine parrondo s paradox using quantum walks and we show this using a two coin state .",
    "we also considered entanglement between the two coins and showed that maximally entangled states do not show any paradox while non - entangled as well as partially entangled states do show the paradox .",
    "our work can be considered as a demonstration of a quantum ratchet too , implying particle transport against an applied bias in presence of noise or perturbations . in our case",
    "the noise parameter can be considered to reduce entanglement , thus looking at fig .",
    "[ concur ] , from zero asymmetry in probability distribution , i.e. , non - directed transport , when there is maximal entanglement to finite asymmetry in probability distribution , i.e. , directed transport when there is no entanglement , is a clear marker of quantum ratchet like behavior in our system .",
