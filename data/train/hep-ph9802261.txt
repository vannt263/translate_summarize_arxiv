    "in a previous paper @xcite we presented the results of an analysis of data on the reaction @xmath0 carried out at a series of discrete energies in the center - of - mass range 1.91 mev to 2.27 mev .",
    "the data consisted of differential cross - sections ( dcs ) for both the @xmath1 and @xmath2 channels and angular asymmetry distributions ( polarizations ) for the @xmath3 channel alone . these were supplemented by invariant amplitudes at each energy obtained in an earlier analysis using hyperbolic dispersion relations @xcite .",
    "the latter allowed analyticity and crossing symmetry to be imposed on the solutions and thus ensured that they were consistent with the wealth of data in the @xmath4 channel .",
    "the amplitude constraints , used for the first time in ref .",
    "@xcite , enabled other published solutions to be ruled out and produced a set of resonance parameters more reliable than those of earlier analyses @xcite .",
    "single - energy analyses , however , do not include the correlations between amplitudes at different energies , nor in our method of extracting resonance parameters did we include correlations between different partial waves . in this paper",
    "we have therefore used the output amplitudes from ref . @xcite as starting values for an energy - dependent analysis in the same energy region .",
    "initially we used the same data set as was used in ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. dcs and polarization values at 20 momenta for the @xmath3 channel from ref .",
    "@xcite ( 1973 data points ) and dcs values at 14 momenta for the @xmath2 channel from ref .",
    "@xcite ( 551 data points ) , giving a total of 2524 data points . in the present case ,",
    "since we are making an energy dependent analysis , the latter did not have to be interpolated to the same momenta as the measured @xmath3 cross - sections .",
    "as in ref .",
    "@xcite , these experimental data were supplemented by values of the invariant amplitudes for the annihilation channel obtained via hyperbolic dispersion relations in ref .",
    "@xcite ( 3304 data points ) .",
    "we have also explored the compatibility of earlier data with this data set by including dcs values for the @xmath3 channel from ref .",
    "@xcite ( 998 data points ) .",
    "the parametrization used was the same as that used in ref .",
    "@xcite , ie we work in the jl basis and each partial - wave helicity amplitude for a given j and l was written as @xmath5 where @xmath6 . here",
    "@xmath7 is the center - of - mass energy and @xmath8 in the second ( background ) term the coefficients @xmath9 are complex parameters and to ensure the correct behaviour at the @xmath10 threshold we set @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the momentum corresponding to @xmath13 gev . in the resonance term ,",
    "the parameters are the mass @xmath14 , the width @xmath15 and the complex residues @xmath16 .",
    "to ensure the correct threshold behaviour at the @xmath10 threshold , we set @xmath17 @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the value of @xmath20 at @xmath21 and @xmath22 is a complex constant . from the values of @xmath22 and @xmath15",
    "one can calculate the product of branching ratios @xmath23 .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath24 are dimensionless and are normalized so that the integrated cross - section for a given isospin is given by @xmath25    the quality of fits to data over a range of energies is always considerably worse than that obtained at a single energy .",
    "this is partly due to normalization differences between different experiments and even between different energies for the same experiment .",
    "also , isolated discrepant points may make an anomalously large contribution to whatever measure is used to judge the quality of the fit .",
    "to reduce the latter effects , we have used robust estimation , minimising the quantity @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the total number of data points and where , for a given data point @xmath28 @xmath29 being the input data point , @xmath30 being the prediction for the same data point from the parametrization and @xmath31 being the error on the data point .",
    "this reduces the influence of isolated discrepant points compared to the usual @xmath32 minimization , although we will also quote the resulting @xmath32 values . in each fit we used as starting values the amplitudes found in ref .",
    "@xcite , with the resonance parameters loosely constrained to lie close to their initial values , typically within 50 mev , although this was not an absolute constraint .",
    "the point here is that we are not attempting to make a systematic search of the entire parameter space , but rather to test the compatibility of the energy dependence of our previous solution with the whole data set . in practice ,",
    "the resonance parameters showed no significant tendency to move away from their initial values .",
    "starting with the data from refs @xcite and @xcite , we found that a solution could be found with a @xmath32 per data point averaged over experiments as follows : 2.05 ( @xmath3 channel ) , 0.61 ( @xmath2 channel ) and 0.11 ( invariant amplitudes ) .",
    "these values are , as expected , higher than obtained in single - energy analyses . allowing small renormalizations ( typically less than 10% ) on the experimental dcs data reduced these values by 21% ( @xmath3 ) and 15% ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "in addition 69 of the 1973 @xmath3 data points contribute more than 10 to @xmath32 ; removing these reduces the @xmath3 average @xmath32 per data point from 2.05 to 1.45 .",
    "however , whether or not these various adjustments are made , the resulting solution remains essentially unchanged .",
    "we also tested the compatibility of earlier data @xcite with the accurate dcs data from lear @xcite by including the former in the fit .",
    "there was little change in either the quality of the fit , the amplitudes or the resonance parameters and so we conclude that the newer lear data @xcite are compatible with the older dcs .",
    "the resonance parameters of the solutions found are shown in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the range of values spans those found in different solutions and using the two data sets .",
    "the parameters are rather similar to those found in ref .",
    "@xcite , as is the pattern of their couplings to the different helicity states .",
    "this is discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite and will not be repeated here . for @xmath33 ,",
    "the width has increased slightly and the value of @xmath34 is somewhat smaller , but there is still strong evidence for a state with an abnormally large coupling to the @xmath10 channel .",
    "two places where the present solution distinguishes different possibilities found in ref .",
    "@xcite are the @xmath35 and @xmath36 waves where in both cases smaller couplings are preferred .",
    "in addition , for @xmath36 a smaller width is found , closer to the width of the established @xmath37 although somewhat smaller than the accepted value .",
    "the corresponding amplitudes are shown in fig .",
