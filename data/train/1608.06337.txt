    "one beam - based method impinges an electron bunch on a thin metallic foil and generates coherent transition radiation ( ctr ) .",

    "another , similar method for producing narrow - band thz radiation has proposed passing the beam through a metallic pipe with small periodic corrugations  @xcite , which is the subject of the present report .",
    "we consider here round geometry which will yield radially polarized thz ( studies of this idea in flat geometry can also be found  @xcite ) .",
    "we present results of measurements of the spectral properties of the radiation excited by the beam .",
    "a corrugated structure that we call  tpipe \" was tested with beam at the accelerator test facility ( atf ) at brookhaven national laboratory .",
    "we first used a relatively long beam , with short rise time  compared to the wavelength of the radiation  to excite the structure , and then used a downstream spectrometer to infer the central wavelength of the radiation .",
    "then for a shorter bunch , by means of an interferometer also downstream of the corrugated pipe , we measured the spectrum of the induced thz . due to a background of diffraction radiation of the bunch field",
    ", we could obtain the relative strength of the thz signal to this background .",
    "our experimental set - up was simple and not optimized for the efficient collection of the radiation ( by _ e.g. _ the inclusion of tapered horns between the structure and the collecting mirror of the interferometer , as was done in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) . as such",
    ", the present experiment should be considered a proof - of - principle experiment for generating thz using a round , corrugated , metallic structure .",
    "specifically , our goal in this work is to demonstrate a narrow - band thz signal downstream of tpipe using the two measurement methods .",
    "in addition , we measure , and compare with calculations , the central frequency of the pulse , the bandwidth , and the relative strength of the signal at the central frequency .",
    "a schematic of the experimental layout is presented in fig .",
    "[ layout_sergey_fi ] .",
    "a 57  mev electron beam was initially shaped using a mask  @xcite and then sent through tpipe to generate a thz pulse .",
    "the beam leaves the structure directly followed by the thz pulse . at the exit of tpipe the radiation pulse diffracts , and further downstream some of it",
    "is reflected by an off - axis parabolic mirror into a michelson interferometer for characterization .",
    "the intensity of the thz signal collected is measured by an irlabs general purpose 4.2k ( liquid helium ) bolometer system .",
    "note that the mirror is located 17.5  cm beyond tpipe , and that in front of the mirror is a 12.5  mm radius iris , which limits the radiation that is collected .",
    "as for the electron beam , it passes through a 2.5  mm radius hole in the mirror , where it generates diffraction radiation , some of which also ends up in the interferometer .",
    "finally , the electron bunch enters the spectrometer for characterization .",
    "to shape the beam we started by accelerating it off - crest in the accelerating section , in order to create a linear correlation between the longitudinal bunch coordinates @xmath1 and energy @xmath2 .",
    "when the beam passes through a dipole magnet (  dipole 1 \" in fig .",
    "[ layout_sergey_fi ] ) it becomes horizontally dispersed as in an energy spectrometer .",
    "a transverse mask is placed after the first dipole to block electrons of certain energies .",
    "a second dipole of opposing sign (  dipole 2 \" ) restores the beam to its original state , minus , however , the electrons that were blocked . due to the @xmath2-@xmath1 correlation of the beam , the image in the downstream spectrometer also carries information about the beam s longitudinal shape .",
    "therefore , distances on the spectrometer image can be related to longitudinal distances within the beam .",
    "consider a metallic beam pipe with a round bore and small , rectangular ( in longitudinal view ) corrugations ( see fig .",
    "[ geometryr_fi ] ) .",
    "the parameters are period @xmath3 , ( full ) depth of corrugation @xmath4 , corrugation gap @xmath5 , and pipe radius @xmath6 ; where we consider small corrugations ( @xmath4 , @xmath3 ) @xmath7 and also @xmath8 .",
    "let us here assume @xmath9 .",
    "it can be shown  @xcite that a short , relativistic bunch , on passing through such a structure , will induce a wakefield that is composed of one dominant mode , of wave number @xmath10 , relative group velocity @xmath11 , with @xmath12 the speed of light , and loss factor @xmath13 , with @xmath14  @xmath15 .",
    "in addition to the effect on the beam , a radiation pulse of the same frequency , with a uniform envelope ( with a relatively sharp rise and fall ) of full length @xmath16 ( @xmath17 is pipe length ) will follow the beam out the downstream end of the structure .",
    "one can see that , in order to generate a pulse of frequency @xmath18  thz , both the bore radius and the corrugation dimensions must be small ; with @xmath19  mm , then @xmath20  @xmath0 m . for @xmath21  mm , @xmath22  @xmath0 m ,",

    "if , in addition , the pipe length is @xmath24  cm , then the full radiation pulse length , @xmath25  mm .        tpipe was machined from two rectangular blocks of high purity copper , each of dimension 2 cm by 1 cm by 5 cm on a side .",
    "two 1-mm ( radius ) cylindrical grooves were first machined in the long direction in each block .",
    "one groove in each block was meant to remain smooth , for the null test of the experiment .",
    "the other groove was further machined , to give it corrugations .",
    "originally , the goal was to have rectangular corrugations ( in longitudinal view ) with period @xmath26  @xmath0 m and ( total ) depth of corrugation @xmath27  @xmath0 m . however , rectangular corrugations of such small size are difficult to make ; thus , a rounded profile was obtained using a 50  @xmath0 m ( radius ) milling bit .",
    "when the machined blocks were measured at slac , it was determined that the corrugations actually had a period of @xmath28  @xmath0 m and a depth of corrugation of 72  @xmath0 m ; furthermore , the radii of the  irises \" and the  cavities \" ( in longitudinal view ) were not identical , and were @xmath29  @xmath0 m and @xmath30  @xmath0 m , respectively ( see fig .",

    "we used a gaussian bunch , with @xmath32  @xmath0 m , and let it pass through an entire 5-cm - long tpipe structure . for the model used in the echo simulations , we used circular arcs ( brown curves in fig .",

    "we see that the model gives a good approximation to the measured shape of tpipe ( the blue curve ) .",
    "echo can calculate the wakefields that a gaussian bunch excites when it passes through a vacuum chamber object .",
