    "the schrdinger equation with the cornell potential is an important non - relativistic model for the study of quark - antiquark systems @xcite . for example , it is used in describing the masses and decay widths of charmonium states .",
    "this coulomb - plus - linear pair potential was originally proposed for describing quarkonia with heavy quarks @xcite .",
    "it takes into account general properties expected from the interquark interaction , namely coulombic behavior at short distances and a linear confining term at long distances @xcite . by varying the parameters one can obtain good fits to lattice measurements for the heavy - quark - antiquark static potential @xcite .",
    "although such models have been studied for many years , exact solutions of schrdinger s equation with this potential are unknown .",
    "most of the earlier work either relies on direct numerical integration of the schrdinger equation or various techniques for approximating the eigenenergies @xcite . without specific reference to a particular physical system , we present a simple and very effective general method for solving schrdinger s equation to any degree of precision in arbitrary dimensional @xmath6 .",
    "we write the cornell potential in the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a parameter representing the coulomb strength , and @xmath9 measures the strength of the linear confining term .",
    "the method we use do not require any particular constraint on the potential parameters and thus they are appropriate for any physical problem that may be modelled by this class of potential .",
    "the method of solution is based on a special application of the asymptotic iteration method ( aim , @xcite ) .",
    "aim is an iterative algorithm originally introduced to investigate the analytic and approximate solutions of a second - order linear differential equation of the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are @xmath13differentiable functions .",
    "it states @xcite that : _ given @xmath14 and @xmath15 in @xmath16 the differential equation ( [ aim_eq ] ) has the general solution @xmath17 d\\tau \\right)dt\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if for some @xmath18 @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are given by @xmath22",
    "_    applications of aim to a variety of problems have been reported in numerous publications over the past few years . in most applications",
    "the functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 are taken to be polynomials or rational functions .",
    "however , we show in this paper that the applicability of the method is not restricted to a particular class of differentiable functions .",
    "we consider the case where @xmath11 and @xmath12 involve higher transcendental functions , specifically airy functions . provided",
    "the computer - algebra system employed has sufficient information about the functions and their derivatives , they present no difficulty .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    ", we set up the @xmath1-dimensional schrdinger equation for the cornell potential and present some analytical spectral bounds based on envelope methods @xcite .",
    "in particular we generalize to @xmath6 dimensions an analytical formula , first derived @xcite for @xmath23 , which exhibits energy upper and lower bounds for all the discrete eigenvalues of the problem . in section [ sec3 ]",
    ", we present an asymptotic solution that allows us to express schrdinger s equation in a form suitable for the application of aim . in section [ sec4 ] , we apply aim to the cornell potential and discuss some of its numerical results , in particular comparisons with the earlier results of eichten et al . @xcite and the recent work of chung and lee @xcite .",
    "if the parametric dependence of the eigenvalues on the potential coefficients @xmath50 and @xmath51 is written @xmath52 then elementary scaling arguments reduce the dimension of the parameter space to one by means of the equation @xmath53 since @xmath25 is at once a convex function of @xmath54 and a concave function of @xmath55 , the envelope method @xcite can be used to derive lower and upper energy bounds based on the comparison theorem and the known exact solutions for the pure hydrogenic and oscillator problems in @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "it turns out @xcite that the bounds can be expressed by a formula for @xmath56 as a function of @xmath57 we have generalized the @xmath23 result of ref .",
    "@xcite to @xmath6 dimensions and we obtain : @xmath58 } { \\left[(1 + 3\\nu^2e)^{\\half}-1\\right]^3}\\equiv g(e),\\quad e\\ge -\\frac{1}{4\\nu^2},\\ ] ] which formula yields an upper bound when @xmath59 and a lower bound when @xmath60 it is interesting that this entire set of lower and upper ( energy ) curves are all scaled versions , for example , of the single ground - state curve .",
    "again , @xmath61 counts the nodes in the radial eigenfunction .",
    "thus by using a computer solve routine to invert the function @xmath62 in for each of the two values of @xmath63 , the energy bounds we can be written in the form @xmath64 for the @xmath65-states , sharper upper bounds may be obtained ( via envelopes of the linear potential ) in terms of the zeros of the airy function .",
    "this is about as far as we can go generally and analytically with this spectral problem .",
    "we note first that the differential equation ( [ sch ] ) has one regular singular point at @xmath66 with exponents given by the roots of the indicial equation @xmath67 and an irregular singular point at @xmath68 . for large @xmath69",
    ", the differential equation assumes the asymptotic form @xmath70u_{nl}^d(r)\\approx 0\\ ] ] with a solution @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the well - known airy function @xcite . since the roots @xmath65 of eq.([indicial ] ) , namely , @xmath73 determine the behavior of @xmath74 as @xmath69 approaches @xmath75 , only @xmath76 is acceptable , since only in this case is the mean value of the kinetic energy finite @xcite .",
    "thus , the exact solution of ( [ sch ] ) assumes the form @xmath77 where we note that @xmath78 as @xmath79 . on insertion of this ansatz wave function into ( [ sch ] )",
    ", we obtain the differential equation for the functions @xmath80 as @xmath81\\right)f_n'(r)+\\left(-a - e\\,r-(k-1)\\frac{d}{dr}\\ln[ai(c^{1/3}\\,r ) ] \\right)f_n(r)=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "for arbitrary values of the potential parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 , aim is an effective method to compute the eigenvalues accurately as roots of the termination condition , which plays a crucial role .",
    "the aim sequences @xmath82 and @xmath83 , @xmath84 , depend on the ( unknown ) eigenvalue @xmath85 and the variable @xmath69 : thus @xmath86 is an implicit function of @xmath85 and @xmath69 .",
    "if the eigenvalue problem is analytically solvable , the roots of the termination condition are independent of the variable @xmath69 in the sense that the roots of @xmath87 are independent of any particular value of @xmath69 . in this case , the eigenvalues are simple zeros of this function . for instance , in the case of a pure coulomb potential @xmath88 , @xmath8 , the exact solutions of schdinger equation @xmath89u_{nl}^d(r)=e_{nl}^d u_{nl}^d(r),\\\\ \\nonumber & k = d+2\\ell,~a>0 , ~ 0<r<\\infty , \\quad u_{nl}^d(0 ) = 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by means of the asymptotic solutions near @xmath90 and @xmath91 , assumes the form @xmath92 where the functions @xmath93 satisfy the differential equation @xmath94 for @xmath95 thus , continuing the pure coulomb case , with @xmath96 we use aim to compute the sequences @xmath20 and @xmath97 initiated with @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "the termination condition is @xmath100 we observe that if @xmath101 , then @xmath102 for all @xmath47 .",
    "direct computation implies @xmath103 and in general @xmath104 as the well - know eigenvalue formula for the coulomb potential in @xmath1-dimensions .",
    "the situation is quite different in the case of @xmath105 .",
    "here we use aim with ( see equation ) @xmath106,\\\\ s_0(r)&=&-e-\\frac{a}{r}-\\frac{(k-1)}{r}\\frac{d}{dr}\\ln[ai(c^{1/3}\\,r)],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the termination condition @xmath87 is a function of both @xmath69 and @xmath85 , namely @xmath107 the problem is then finding an initial value @xmath108 that would stabilize the recursive computation of the roots by the termination condition for all @xmath47 .",
    "this is still an open problem with no general strategy to locate this initial value .",
    "a good choice for @xmath109 depends on the shape of the potential under consideration and sometimes on the asymptotic solution process itself .",
    "thus two policies for the choice of @xmath109 are : ( 1 ) the point where the minimum of the potential occurs if it is not infinity ; ( 2 ) the point where the maximum of the ground - state asymptotic solution occurs . for the cornell potential , because of the attractive coulomb term , the potential function is not bounded below and we therefore choose @xmath109 to be the location of the maximum of the ground - state wave function as follows .",
    "the asymptotic solution is given by : @xmath110 and we suppose that @xmath111 is the position of the maximum of @xmath112 we start with @xmath113 then we gradually increase the value of @xmath109 until we reach stability in the computational process , in the sense that it converges in few iterations .",
    "thus , once a suitable value is found for @xmath109 for a parameter patch , the actual eigenvalue calculations are extremely fast .",
    "we only found one difficulty with this approach for the present problem , namely when @xmath51 is small so that the wave function is very spread out ( like the pure coulomb case ) . in order to deal wih this",
    ", we adopted the following strategy : we took @xmath109 as a point at which the tail of the asymptotic solution starts to diminish rapidly . in figure 1 , we show plots of @xmath114 for different values of @xmath51 .",
    "these graphs suggest that the starting value of @xmath115 for the potential @xmath116 , the starting value of @xmath117 for the potential @xmath118 , and @xmath119 for @xmath120 .     as @xmath51 increases.,title=\"fig:\",width=188,height=113 ]   as @xmath51 increases.,title=\"fig:\",width=188,height=113 ]   as @xmath51 increases.,title=\"fig:\",width=188,height=113 ]    for the purpose of consistency we have calculated each eigenvalue to 12 significant figures and recorded in a subscript the minimum number of iterations required to reach this precision .",
    "the computation of the airy function is straightforward , thanks to maple , where the _ ` airyai ' _ and its derivative are built - in functions .",
    "the eigenvalues reported in table [ table : tab1 ] were computed using maple version 16 running on an apple imac computer in a high - precision environment . in order to accelerate our computation",
    "we have written our own code for a root - finding algorithm instead of using the default procedure solve of _",
    "maple 16_. the results of aim may be obtained to any desired degree of precision : we have reported most of our results to twelve decimal places , and those of table [ table : tab3 ] to fifteen places , as an illustration . of course , once the energy eigenvalue has been determined accurately , it is straightforward to integrate to find the corresponding wave function @xmath121 we exhibit the result in fig .",
