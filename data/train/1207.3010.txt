    "superexchange models with spin - orbital entanglement on superexchange bonds , discovered by exact diagonalization of finite chains @xcite , are a good recent example of entanglement in many - body systems .",
    "entanglement is inherent to quantum mechanics and occurs in several systems . in general",
    "it means that quantum states have internal structure and can not be represented as products of states which belong to different subspaces of the full hilbert space @xcite .",
    "this property of quantum states has gained renewed interest in recent years as it was found in several many - body quantum systems and it was realized that it may play a role in quantum information .",
    "it is shown below that it leads to measurable consequences in condensed matter systems with strongly correlated electrons , when orbital degrees of freedom are active .",
    "this new development concerns both model systems and the physical properties of mott ( or charge transfer ) insulators  we summarize it shortly in the present topical review .",
    "entanglement in quantum many - body systems is a broad field @xcite and will not be discussed here as such . in the last few decades",
    "the interest in quantum entanglement has risen sharply in various formerly disconnected subfields of physics . at present",
    "these different communities come closer to each other in the search for universal ways of quantifying entanglement and developing algorithms to treat many - body quantum systems .",
    "an interested reader is encouraged to consult several review articles published recently on this subject  we name here only a few which focus on entanglement in : ( @xmath3 ) many - body systems @xcite , ( @xmath4 ) quantum spin systems @xcite , ( @xmath5 ) interacting fermionic and bosonic many - particle systems @xcite , ( @xmath7 ) optical lattices @xcite , and finally , ( @xmath8 ) quantum cryptography and quantum communication @xcite .",
    "entanglement entropy plays a central role in these systems and is frequently used as a quantitative measure of entanglement @xcite .",
    "spin - orbital entanglement occurs either due to the relativistic on - site spin - orbit coupling or due to superexchange interactions on the bonds .",
    "while finite spin - orbit coupling introduces on - site entanglement , a qualitatively new and challenging situation is encountered when degenerate @xmath9 orbitals of transition metal ions are partly filled and orbital degrees of freedom have to be treated on equal footing with electron spins in the effective spin - orbital superexchange model @xcite . here",
    "we mainly on the latter but some recent examples of entangled states in cases with strong spin - orbit coupling will also be mentioned for completeness at the end .",
    "when degenerate @xmath9 orbitals in a transition metal oxide are partly filled , realistic superexchange includes both orbital and spin degrees of freedom that are strongly interrelated @xcite .",
    "the microscopic models designed to describe realistic systems with strongly correlated and partly localized electrons include as well orbital interactions which follow from the orbital - lattice coupling and tune the orbital correlations .",
    "these latter interactions are rather strong in the @xmath10 orbital systems and stabilize the orbital order at rather high temperature , as for instance in lamno@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "it such cases it is well justified to treat the spin - orbital superexchange in the mean field ( mf ) approximation which separates orbital degrees of freedom and their dynamics from the spin ones @xcite .",
    "the spin and orbital degrees of freedom order then in a complementary way and their order follows the classical goodenough - kanamori rules @xcite .",
    "they were derived long ago from the microscopic insights concerning the structure of spin - orbital superexchange and predict that the antiferromagnetic ( af ) order coexists with ferro - orbital ( fo ) order and ferromagnetic ( fm ) order coexists with alternating orbital ( ao ) order . out of many examples which follow these rules ,",
    "we mention here only the lamno@xmath1 perovskite , with active @xmath10 orbitals and coexisting fm / ao order in @xmath11 planes and af / fo order along the @xmath12 axis @xcite . in this case",
    "spin and orbital operators indeed separate as the orbital order sets in at high temperature @xmath13 k and is already saturated when the @xmath14-type af ( @xmath14-af ) order occurs at @xmath15 k. therefore , the optical spectral weights measured in experiment are well described by the mf decoupling of spin and orbital degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "for this reason simple treatments of the models of manganites which use the mf approach @xcite or hartree - fock decoupling @xcite are very successful in modeling the complex phase diagram of monolayer , bilayer and cubic manganites @xcite .    in a number of compounds with active orbital degrees of freedom where strong on - site coulomb interactions localize electrons ( or holes ) and give rise to spin - orbital superexchange , two different types of long - range order compete with each other .",
    "a prominent example of this behaviour are the @xmath0vo@xmath1 perovskites , where @xmath0=lu , yb,@xmath2,la . in the case of perovskite vanadates",
    "the cubic symmetry is broken by gdfeo@xmath1-like distortions and the @xmath16 orbitals are singly occupied at all v@xmath17 ions , while the second electron occupies the @xmath18 doublet .",
    "one finds here two different af phases for v@xmath17 ions in @xmath19 electronic configuration with @xmath20 spin : ( @xmath3 ) the @xmath6-type af ( @xmath6-af ) phase with staggered af order in the @xmath11 planes accompanied by the fm order along the @xmath12 axis , coexisting with weak ao order of active @xmath21 orbitals @xmath18 , and ( @xmath4 ) the @xmath22-type af ( @xmath22-af ) phase with staggered af order along all three cubic axes coexisting with robust @xmath6-type orbital order @xcite .",
    "in fact , the coexisting orbital and magnetic order in these phases obey the goodenough - kanamori rules along the @xmath12 axis .",
    "however , the situation in @xmath11 planes of this class of compounds is puzzling as two alternating orders coexist , both for spins and for orbitals .",
    "the reasons of this coexistence are more subtle  there also @xmath16 orbitals are singly occupied at every ion and they are in a fo state , while the spin order , driven mainly by them , is af .",
    "so once again , the order in the @xmath11 planes can be understood using the goodenough - kanamori rules .",
    "however , the af / ao order may be seen as entangled in the subspace of @xmath18 orbitals and provides an interesting situation in doped systems , as we shall discuss below .",
    "recent interest and theoretical progress in the understanding of spin - orbital superexchange models was triggered by the observation that orbital degeneracy significantly enhances quantum fluctuations which may even suppress long - range order when different types of symmetry broken states compete with each other near the quantum critical point @xcite .",
    "the simplest and paradigmatic model in this context is the kugel - khomskii model introduced long ago for kcuf@xmath1 @xcite , a strongly correlated insulator with a single hole within degenerate @xmath10 orbitals at cu@xmath23 ions in the @xmath24 electronic configuration .",
    "this model has two parameters which favour different types of symmetry broken states : ( @xmath3 ) hund s exchange interaction , and ( @xmath4 ) the crystal field splitting of @xmath10 orbitals .",
    "when both these parameters are small the system is driven by its quantum nature  either long - range order disappears @xcite or , for certain parameters , coexisting spin and orbital order might be stabilized by order out of disorder mechanism @xcite .",
    "we shall discuss below to what extent the order is classical and show that spin - orbital entanglement manifests itself in the regime of most frustrated interactions .",
    "first , in this topical review we shall elucidate certain situations with the spin - orbital entanglement in the ground states ( gss ) .",
    "such gss are very challenging as there are no good methods in the theory to investigate them in a systematic way .",
    "it will become evident that quite different gss arise , characterized by overestimated energy and incorrect correlation functions , when spin - orbital entanglement is neglected .",
    "second , even when the gss are not entangled , entanglement may be experimentally observed and has important consequences at finite temperature when the behaviour of the system is driven by low - energy excited states with spin - orbital entanglement .",
    "the existence of such states is a generic feature of any spin - orbital superexchange model and therefore the relevant question is only whether such states are accessible for thermal excitations . it will be shown that a rather exotic behaviour of the @xmath0vo@xmath1 perovskites can not be understood without including the spin - orbital entangled states .",
    "this point of view is supported by several experimental observations : ( @xmath3 ) the thermal evolution of the optical spectral weights @xcite , ( @xmath4 ) the phase diagram of the @xmath0vo@xmath1 perovskites @xcite , and ( @xmath5 ) the observed dimerization in the magnon spectra of yvo@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "an interesting situation arises also in doped mott insulators , where doped holes introduce charge degrees of freedom which perturb the orbital order and frequently lead to phases with coexisting spin , charge and orbital order @xcite . when orbital degrees of freedom are quenched , one finds that hole propagation occurs in the @xmath25-@xmath26 model via a quasiparticle state that emerges due to quantum fluctuations in the spin background @xcite . in @xmath25-@xmath26-like superexchange models with orbital degrees of freedom ,",
    "hole propagation is either entirely suppressed by incoherent processes @xcite , or occurs by a rather subtle mechanism : either by off - diagonal orbital hopping in @xmath10 orbital systems @xcite , or by next - nearest neighbour effective hopping in @xmath21 systems @xcite .",
    "when both spin and orbital degrees of freedom may contribute , the situation is less clear as scattering on spin - flip processes introduces additional incoherence in hole propagation @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , it was realized only recently that spin - orbital entanglement introduces topological constraints for hole propagation in a mott insulator with coexisting af and ao order @xcite , and may thus have serious measurable consequences in doped @xmath0vo@xmath1 perovskites .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we explain general concepts of : ( @xmath3 ) intrinsic frustration of orbital interactions , ( @xmath4 ) spin - orbital superexchange , and ( @xmath5 ) its consequences for the magnetic exchange constants and the optical spectral weights .",
    "next we describe spin - orbital entanglement in the gss of spin - orbital models in section 3 .",
    "such models are usually employed to explain the magnetic properties of transition metal oxides @xcite and are also used to derive the optical spectral weights @xcite .",
    "therefore , even when the gss are disentangled , entangled states have severe consequences on the experimentally observed properties of some mott insulators at finite temperature , and we describe in section 4 the properties of the perovskite @xmath0vo@xmath1 systems as an example of such a complex behaviour driven by quantum entanglement .",
    "spin - orbital entanglement may also occur in gss in particular parameter regimes , and we provide two examples of this behaviour in : ( @xmath3 ) the kugel - khomskii model on a bilayer @xcite , and ( @xmath4 ) the @xmath27 model for @xmath21 electrons on a triangular lattice @xcite . entangled states may have also interesting consequences for hole propagation in ordered states  here we present the coupling of a hole to joint spin - orbital excitations @xcite , see section 6 . the paper is concluded in section 7 , where a general discussion and main conclusions are presented .",
    "before presenting the spin - orbital entanglement , we first introduce the characteristic features of orbital superexchange interactions as obtained in case of spin polarized ( fm ) systems .",
    "these interactions are fundamentally different from spin superexchange which has high su(2 ) symmetry and intrinsically frustrated .",
    "frustration is one of the simplest concepts in physics with far reaching consequences @xcite .",
    "the main and unusual feature of orbital interactions is their intrinsic frustration that follows from the directional nature of superexchange terms which contribute along different bonds and compete with one another @xcite .",
    "this type of frustration does not follow from geometrical frustration and is best understood by considering a two - dimensional ( 2d ) square lattice . in case of the ising model frustration on a square lattice can be achieved , for instance , by changing signs of interactions along every second column and leaving the other interactions unchanged . in this case",
    "all plaquettes of the 2d lattice are frustrated as one of the interactions has the wrong sign but the spins order  the model is exactly solvable and has long - range order following the dominating interaction below a finite transition temperature @xcite , being lower than the one of the 2d ising model . we emphasize that this frustrated model is exactly solvable because it is still classical as the interactions concern only commuting @xmath28 spin components .    in contrast , the orbital interactions on a pseudocubic lattice are _ quantum _ , both for @xmath10 and @xmath21 orbitals , because they involve at least two pseudospin components @xcite .",
    "such models have different ( typically cubic ) symmetry from both the z@xmath29 symmetry of ising and su(2 ) symmetry of heisenberg model , and are in general not exactly solvable on a 2d square lattice .",
    "we begin with the case of @xmath10 orbitals interacting within a 2d @xmath11 plane of k@xmath29cuf@xmath30 compound ; models for three - dimensional ( 3d ) perovskites , for instance kcuf@xmath1 with @xmath24 electronic configurations of cu@xmath23 ions or lamno@xmath1 with @xmath31 configurations of mn@xmath17 ions discussed below can be easily obtained as a straightforward generalization of the 2d model using the cubic symmetry of orbital interactions @xcite .",
    "two @xmath10 orbital states , @xmath32 are the eigenstates of the @xmath33 orbital operator for pseudospin @xmath34 , where @xmath35 are hole number operators at site @xmath3 .",
    "the origin of intrinsic frustration in the @xmath10 orbital superexchange is best realized by considering its form @xcite , @xmath36 where the bond is oriented along one of the cubic axes @xmath37 @xcite . here",
    "the orbital interaction @xmath38 follows from the energy of the high - spin charge excitation @xcite .",
    "the pseudospin operators take a different form depending on the bond direction and are defined as follows , @xmath39 where @xmath40 are pauli matrices and the sign @xmath41 in @xmath42 is selected for a bond @xmath43 along @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) axis .",
    "thus for the @xmath11 plane one has two linear combinations of @xmath46 pauli matrices , and these interactions favour aos on each bond , being the eigenstates of the @xmath47 pauli matrix as the interactions @xmath48 are here the strongest ones .",
    "we emphasize that the interactions in equation are fundamentally different from the su(2)-symmetric spin interactions , as they : ( @xmath3 ) obey only lower cubic symmetry , ( @xmath4 ) are ising - like and select only one component of the pseudospin interaction along each bond which favours pairs of orthogonal orbitals , i.e. , oriented along the bond ( @xmath49-like ) and the orthogonal to it lying in the plane perpendicular to the bond ( @xmath50-like ) .",
    "this manifests the intrinsic frustration of orbital interactions in the @xmath10 orbital case @xcite .",
    "in fact , the interactions in equation are ising - like and classical only in the one - dimensional ( 1d ) model @xcite , but in general they are not . however , due to the gap which opens in orbital excitations in the 2d model , the quantum corrections generated by them are rather small @xcite .",
    "the essence of orbital frustration which characterizes the @xmath10 orbital superexchange is captured by the 2d compass model @xcite which arises by increasing frustration from the 2d @xmath10 orbital model to the maximal frustration @xcite .",
    "one considers then the 2d model ( or an exactly solvable model compass ladder @xcite ) that interpolates between the classical ising one and the compass one passing through the @xmath10 orbital model .",
    "the orbital interactions @xmath51 are equal along both rows and columns but select two orthogonal pseudospin components @xcite : @xmath52 usually one considers the af case ( @xmath53 ) but the fm model ( @xmath54 ) is equivalent and equally frustrated .",
    "intersite interactions in the 2d compass model are descibed by products @xmath55 of pseudospin components with @xmath56 , @xmath57 rather than by pseudospin scalar products @xmath58 . as explained below",
    ", such scalar products arise for the superexchange interactions with active @xmath21 orbitals degrees of freedom which allow hopping processes for a pair of them in each 2d plane in the cubic system .",
    "instead in the compass model the @xmath59 interactions for bonds @xmath43 along the @xmath44 axis compete with the @xmath60 ones along the @xmath45 axis @xcite . also the 1d compass model with alternating @xmath61 and @xmath62 interactions",
    "@xcite is intrinsically frustrated .",
    "recently the 2d compass model was investigated by monte carlo simulations and the existence of a phase transition at finite temperature was established @xcite .",
    "the ordered gs is degenerate and its different states correspond to either eigenstates of @xmath63 pseudospin components ordered along the rows , or eigenstates of pseudospin @xmath64 components ordered along the columns @xcite .",
    "although this gs is destabilized by infinitesimal pseudospin interactions , the structure of the lowest excited states stays unchanged and corresponds to the flips of spin columns @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the model could serve as an effective model for protected qubits and such states realized by josephson arrays @xcite could play a role in quantum communication . indeed , first experimental successes in constructing special networks of josephson junctions that are designed following the compass model were reported recently @xcite .",
    "although frustration still increases by going from the 2d to 3d @xmath10 orbital model , there are indications from recent monte carlo simulations that the gs is ordered @xcite .",
    "disorder occurs here by doping which leads to the 3d orbital liquid state @xcite that plays a prominent role in the fm metallic manganites and provides an explanation for the observed magnon dispersion @xcite .",
    "the case of the 3d compass model is more subtle .",
    "it was concluded from the high temperature expansion that the ordered state is excluded here @xcite , but this result was challenged recently @xcite and further studies are needed to establish whether this model could indeed serve as an example of an orbital liquid phase .",
    "the orbital models for @xmath21 orbitals contain more terms and were less studied up to now .",
    "the generic form contains scalar products of two pseudospins @xmath65 along each direction in the cubic lattice , defined as in equations @xcite , @xmath66 where the operators @xmath67 depend on the bond direction , i.e. , the pseudospin components are defined here in different subspaces of the hilbert space , depending on the pair of active @xmath21 orbitals .",
    "this form follows from the fact that only two @xmath21 orbitals allow for electron hopping along a given cubic direction @xmath68 , while the third orbital is inactive , see also below and section 4 . for finite hund s exchange",
    "additional terms arise and the orbital state is disordered @xcite .",
    "a stable orbital ordered state was found here in the 3d orbital model for ytio@xmath1 , when the spins decouple from @xmath21 orbitals in the fm phase @xcite .      in transition metal compounds with large on - site",
    "coulomb interactions charge fluctuations are suppressed and electrons partly localize .",
    "this happens when intraorbital coulomb interaction @xmath69 is large compared to the effective @xmath70 hopping element @xmath25 , where @xmath25 is either the @xmath71 or @xmath72 effective @xmath70 hopping element for @xmath10 and @xmath21 systems , respectively , that arises via hybridization with ligand orbitals . in the regime of @xmath73 , correlated ( mott or charge - transfer ) insulators arise in undoped compounds , while doping leads to interesting phenomena in strongly correlated electron systems with charge fluctuations only between two neighbouring electronic configurations @xcite .",
    "intersite charge excitations may be then treated within perturbation theory , while the hopping processes which do not cost high local coulomb energy @xmath69 and occur in doped systems are treated in the restricted hilbert space .",
    "a well known example of this description is the @xmath25-@xmath26 model , used widely to describe the physical properties of high-@xmath74 superconductors , but derived one decade before their discovery @xcite .",
    "here we concentrate on mott insulators with transition metal ions in @xmath75 electronic configuration and active orbital degrees of freedom , where the effective low - energy hamiltonians contain spin - orbital superexchange , described within spin - orbital models @xcite .",
    "such models are derived using the realistic multiplet structure of the excited states of transition metal ions which arise in @xmath76 intersite charge excitations .",
    "as the multiplet structure depends on the electron number @xmath77 @xcite , with some examples given in @xcite , these models are specific to a given family of compounds . as a representative example we consider here in more detail the case of the @xmath0vo@xmath1 perovskites ( see section 4 ) , with @xmath20 spin stabilized by hund s exchange and active @xmath21 orbitals at v@xmath17 ions in @xmath19 ( @xmath78 ) electronic configuration . in a cubic perovskite all three @xmath21",
    "orbitals are degenerate and the kinetic energy electrons is given by : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is electron creation operator for an electron at site @xmath3 in orbital state @xmath81 with spin @xmath82 .",
    "the summation runs over three cubic axes , @xmath37 , and involves the bonds @xmath83 along them .",
    "the hopping @xmath25 results from transitions via an intermediate o(@xmath84 ) orbital and conserves the active @xmath21 orbital flavor @xmath85 .",
    "thus the hopping @xmath25 is an effective @xmath72 element that originates from two subsequent @xmath86 hopping processes along each v@xmath87o@xmath87v bond in the @xmath0vo@xmath1 perovskite structure . for @xmath10 systems the derivation is similar but the effective hopping elements follow from the hybridization with o(@xmath88 )",
    "the effective hopping follows from the charge - transfer model with @xmath89 hybridization @xmath90 and charge - transfer energy @xmath91 @xcite , and one expects in the present vanadate case @xmath92 ev @xcite .",
    "only two @xmath21 orbitals , labelled by @xmath85 , are active along each bond @xmath93 and contribute to the kinetic energy , while the third one lies in the plane perpendicular to the @xmath68 axis and the hopping via the intermediate oxygen @xmath84 ( or @xmath88 ) oxygen orbital is forbidden by symmetry .",
    "this justifies a simplified notation used below , with the orbitals defined by the axis direction which is perpendicular to their plane : @xmath94    in this case only @xmath21 orbitals are partly filled by electrons , and it suffices to consider local coulomb interactions between @xmath21 electrons at v@xmath17 ions described by the degenerate hubbard hamiltonian @xcite , @xmath95 here @xmath96 is the electron density operator in orbital @xmath97 at site @xmath3 , and spin operators @xmath98 for orbital @xmath81 at site @xmath3 are related to fermion operators in the standard way , i.e. , @xmath99 the first term in describes the largest intraorbital coulomb interaction @xmath69 for a pair of electrons with antiparallel spins in orbital @xmath81 .",
    "the second term stands for the interorbital coulomb ( density ) interaction , the third one is called frequently the `` pair - hopping '' term , and the last one is hund s exchange @xmath100 . the choice of coefficients in guarantees that the interactions satisfy the rotational invariance in the orbital space @xcite .",
    "this hamiltonian is exact when it describes only one representation of the cubic symmetry group ( here @xmath21 orbitals which are partly occupied in the cubic vanadates )  then the on - site interactions are given by two parameters : ( @xmath3 ) the intraorbital coulomb element @xmath69 , and ( @xmath4 ) hund s exchange element @xmath100 .",
    "these elements may be expressed by the racah parameters @xmath101 . for @xmath21 electrons considered in section 4 one",
    "finds @xcite : @xmath102 hund s exchange ( and interorbital coulomb interaction ) is in general anisotropic and depends on the pair of interacting orbital states .",
    "for instance , the corresponding @xmath10 hund s exchange element is @xmath103 .",
    "more details are given in @xcite .",
    "in the limit of large @xmath69 ( @xmath73 ) , the effective low - energy spin - orbital superexchange interactions arise by considering all the contributions which originate from possible virtual excitations @xmath104 .",
    "the general structure of spin - orbital superexchange @xcite , @xmath105 involves interactions between su(2)-symmetric spin scalar products @xmath106 on each bond @xmath43 , connecting two nearest - neighbor transition metal ions , each one coupled to orbital operators @xmath107 .",
    "the orbital operators are given in and obey only much lower symmetry ( at most cubic for a cubic lattice ) .",
    "these operators contribute to the form of orbital operators @xmath108 and @xmath109 which depend on the model .",
    "they involve the active orbitals on each bond @xmath110 along direction @xmath68 .    in order to derive magnetic excitations for the systems with orbital degeneracy one",
    "usually derives magnetic exchange constants for a bond @xmath110 by averaging over the orbital operators in equation using the gs @xmath111 with decoupled spin and orbital operators , @xmath112 this procedure assumes implicitly that spin and orbital operators can be decoupled from each other in the mf approach and ignores the possibility of entanglement and composite spin - orbital excitations introduced in @xcite .",
    "_ inter alia _ , such excitations play a prominent role in destabilizing the classical af long - range order in the @xmath24 spin - orbital model @xcite .",
    "the energy scale for the superexchange is given by @xmath113 where @xmath25 is the relevant effective hopping element and @xmath69 is the intraorbital coulomb element defined in .",
    "as several charge excitations contribute to the superexchange , the balance between competing terms depends on hund s exchange , namely on @xmath114 this is the only parameter which decides about the strength of particular interactions in the superexchange and finally also about the type of magnetic correlations or symmetry breaking in the gs obtained at orbital degeneracy and favoured by the model .",
    "we would like to emphasize here that the same charge excitations which decide about the spin - orbital superexchange contribute as well to the optical conductivity .",
    "in this case they appear at distinct energies of individual charge excitations that occur at a given ionic filling , and depend on the multiplet structure of the excited states arising from intersite charge transitions @xcite .",
    "each of these excitations involves a different intermediate state in the multiplet structure of at least one of the ions after the charge excitation , i.e. , either in the @xmath115 or in the @xmath116 configuration or in both , depending on the actual process and on the value of @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "this feature made it possible to relate the averages of these different excitations to the spectral weights in the optical spectroscopy @xcite , and this principle serves now as a theoretical tool to analyse and explain the observed anisotropy and temperature dependence of the spectral weights in the optical spectra @xcite .",
    "as the charge excitations correspond to particular expressions in the spin - orbital space , it is important to rewrite ther superexchange hamiltonian by decomposing it into individual terms on each bond @xmath43 that stem from particular excited states labeled by @xmath117 @xcite , @xmath118 here the superexchange constant was included in the operators @xmath119 .",
    "as explained above , the spectral weight in the optical spectroscopy is given in a correlated insulator by the same virtual charge excitations that contribute also to the superexchange .",
    "they define the individual kinetic energy terms @xmath120 along the axis @xmath68 , which can be determined from the superexchange using the hellman - feynman theorem @xcite , @xmath121 for convenience , we define them here as positive quantities , @xmath122 .",
    "the spectral weights are defined by the bond correlation functions and their changes with increasing temperature which decide about the _ temperature dependence _ of the optical spectrum . to describe experimental observations",
    "it is therefore important to analyse the various multiplet excitations separately , as they depend on these correlations in a different way , and will also contribute to a _ quite different temperature dependence _",
    ", as we show in this paper on the example of lavo@xmath1 in section 4 .",
    "such an analysis is of course possible in each case , as the respective spin - orbital superexchange models are derived by considering all different types of charge excitations individually @xcite .    in some cases",
    ", however , spin dynamics separates from the orbital one in the gs and mf factorization of spin and orbital operators is indeed allowed .",
    "this happens when the orbital order is stabilized to a large extent by strong interactions with the lattice which undergoes jahn - teller distortions .",
    "a good example of this behaviour is lamno@xmath1 , where the superexchange and the jahn - teller effect help each other @xcite in stabilizing the orbital order which occurs below the relatively high transition temperature @xmath123 k. the @xmath14-af spin order is observed below a much lower nel temperature @xmath15 k @xcite . in this case a very satisfactory description of the experimental results for the spectral weight distribution in the optical spectroscopy is obtained using disentangled spin - orbital superexchange , both for the high spin @xcite and low spin @xcite optical excitations . below we focus on some examples of a more complex behaviour driven by the spin - orbital entanglement .",
    "before presenting the essence of spin - orbital entanglement , we would like to remind the reader severe consequences of the mf approximation used frequently to investigate spin and/or orbital models . in this approach quantum fluctuations",
    "are neglected and only qualitative conclusions concerning possible symmetry breaking can be drawn . in spin - orbital systems",
    "the mf approach may be applied in different ways , and here we focus on the decoupling of spin and orbital degrees of freedom presented below for a single bond in .",
    "when only spin - orbital coupling is treated in the mf approach , spin and orbital operators are disentangled .",
    "we show in and that this approximation is unsatisfactory in many situations .    to detect spin - orbital entanglement in the gs we evaluate intersite spin , orbital and joint spin - orbital bond correlations in several models , defined as follows for a nearest - neighbour bond @xmath43 ( we keep the notation general here , for the 1d chain @xmath124 ) @xcite : @xmath125 the above general expressions imply averaging over the exact gs found from lanczos diagonalization of a finite cluster and are valid for @xmath126 and @xmath20 encountered in the models for @xmath21 orbitals investigated in .",
    "while @xmath127 and @xmath128 correlations indicate the tendency towards particular spin and orbital order , @xmath129 quantifies the spin - orbital entanglement  if @xmath130 spin and orbital operators are entangled and the mf approximation , i.e. , decoupling of spin and pseudospin operators in , can not be applied as it generates uncontrollable errors .",

    "the 2d spin - orbital @xmath25-@xmath26 model may be seen as a generalization of the spin @xmath25-@xmath26 model @xcite and the orbital @xmath21 @xmath25-@xmath26 model @xcite to the spin - orbital superexchange  it consists of three terms @xcite , @xmath505 where the last one , @xmath506 , stands for the three - site effective hopping .",
    "the second term @xmath507 is the spin - orbital superexchange model for the @xmath0vo@xmath1 perovskites introduced above in .",
    "the first term in ( [ eq : str - coupl ] ) describes the hopping of @xmath210 electrons in the constrained hilbert space , i.e. , in the space with singly occupied ( at hole position ) or doubly occupied sites .",
    "this means that electrons in the @xmath11 plane , which is under consideration here , can hop only along the @xmath45 ( @xmath44 ) direction when they carry @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) orbital flavour .",
    "the @xmath12 orbitals do not participate in hopping processes as they are always occupied by one electron , see @xcite .",
    "hence , we arrive at the kinetic @xmath508 part of hamiltonian ( [ eq : str - coupl ] ) , @xmath509 here the constrained operators @xmath510 mean that the hopping is allowed only in the restricted hilbert space with not more than one @xmath210 electron at each site @xmath511 ( @xmath512 stands for the spin component opposite to @xmath513 ) . besides , since hund s exchange coupling is large ( @xmath514 ) @xcite , we project the final states resulting from the electron hopping onto the high - spin states , which occurs due to the @xmath515 operators in .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite .",
    "low energy excitations are magnons and orbitons , with their energies determined by the respective exchange constants derived from the spin - orbital superexchange @xcite , @xmath516 one finds that @xmath517 and @xmath518 in the expected range of @xmath420 , which means that the classical gs has indeed coexisting af and ao order . by rotating first spins and orbitals at sublattice @xmath14 to the fm / fo order and introducing schwinger bosons @xmath519 for spin and @xmath520 for orbital excitations ,",
    "one finds the energies of magnons and orbitons using the lsw theory . as usually in a quantum antiferromagnet , magnons are dispersive and have a goldstone mode , @xmath521 where @xmath522 is given by , @xmath20 and @xmath523 is the coordination number .",
    "in contrast , the orbital excitations at energy @xmath524 are local and have no dispersion as the orbital interactions are ising - like .",
    "a crucial step in deriving the hole spectral function @xmath525 is the following representation of the electron operators in terms of the @xmath526 ( @xmath527 ) schwinger bosons : @xmath528 the above equations demonstrate that a spin excitation is always generated together with an orbital excitation , which implies that the diagrams contributing to the self - energy contain only vertices with two outgoing or incoming excitation lines .",
    "the factor @xmath529 follows from spin algebra for spins @xmath20 in the spin - orbital model @xcite . here",
    "the projection onto the high - spin states has already been done , so the projection operators @xmath515 in @xmath530 are no longer needed .",
    "the spectral function can be obtained from the green s functions which are defined separately for @xmath531 and @xmath532 sublattice and depend on the corresponding self - energy @xmath533 ( @xmath527 ) : @xmath534 here @xmath535 and @xmath536 , and @xmath537 describes the three - site hopping responsible for the 1d dispersion within each sublattice . in what follows",
    "we show only the result for @xmath538 for more clarity .",
    "green s functions are solved self - consistently together with the self - energies derived in the self - consistent born approximation ( scba ) . after solving the green s functions , the spectral functions for a hole created in @xmath539 orbital are : @xmath540 at @xmath538 the spectral function",
    "does not depend on the orbital flavour , and we define @xmath541 .    the spectral functions @xmath525 shown in are representative for the situation in the strongly correlated transition metal oxides .",
    "they are obtained by solving the scba equations for @xmath542 on a mesh of @xmath543 @xmath544-points .",
    "similar data for other values of @xmath545 and @xmath546 are presented in @xcite .",
    "a realistic value of hund s exchange in lavo@xmath1 is @xmath547 @xcite .",
    "the peak in the low - energy part of the spectrum , see ( c ) , has no dispersion which indicates hole confinement ( a rather weak 1d dispersion along the @xmath548 ( @xmath549 ) direction for holes doped into the @xmath45 ( @xmath44 ) orbitals is obtained at finite @xmath537 ) .",
    "the spin - orbital spectral functions form ladder - like spectra and have many similarities with the spectra obtained for the @xmath21 orbital @xmath25-@xmath26 model @xcite . however , there are few subtle differences with the orbital model which demonstrate that the spin - orbital case is more complex and the spin part also contributes .",

    ", width=302 ]    to understand better the nature of the obtained spectra we present also the spectral functions obtained for the related spin and orbital problem in ( a - b ) .",
    "these two models read as follows @xcite : @xmath553 here spin operators @xmath554 stand for @xmath20 spins , @xmath555 are @xmath49th components of pseudospin @xmath556 , and the operators @xmath515 project onto the high - spin states .",
    "the constrained electron operators , @xmath557 in and @xmath558 and @xmath559 in exclude double occupancies from the hilbert space in each case , similar to .",
    "the superexchange energy scale is @xmath560 for the spin model and @xmath524 for the orbital one , which mimics the influence of the orbital part on the spins and of the spin part ( with the af order ) on the orbitals . with the present parameters one finds the spin - only exchange constant @xmath561 ( somewhat higher than that deduced from the observed value of the nel temperature @xmath562 k in lavo@xmath1 @xcite ) , and @xmath551 .",
    "the spectral functions for the above models were obtained using the scba on a mesh of @xmath543 @xmath544-points , following the derivations presented in @xcite and @xcite in the case of the spin and orbital model .",
    "one only has to make the following substitutions in the respective scba equations : @xmath563 , @xmath564 and ( due to the quantum double exchange factor ) also @xmath565 in the spin case @xcite , and @xmath566 , @xmath567 , and @xmath568 in the orbital case @xcite .",
    "the spectral functions obtained for the above toy models are quite different from those obtained for the spin - orbital @xmath25-@xmath26 model . the spectral function for the spin model , see ( b ) , consists of a qp and the incoherent part at higher energies , both having considerable @xmath544-dependence .",
    "it is evident that this @xmath544-dependence is removed by the orbital interactions .",
    "the orbital model at @xmath538 has a strictly localized spectral function with a ladder spectrum @xcite , see ( a ) .",
    "the spin - orbital spectral function , see ( c ) , resembles qualitatively the ladder spectrum found for the orbital model in ( a ) .",
    "the momentum dependence of both the qp state and the incoherent part of the spectrum obtained for the spin model , see ( b ) , is entirely suppressed .",
    "these results demonstrate that the quantum spin fluctuations are to a large extent quenched in the spin - orbital model by the simultaneous coupling of the hole to _ both _ spin and orbital excitations .",
    "it is remarkable that the hole still couples to the spin degrees of freedom by generating string potential due to defects created by hole motion .",
    "thus , _ the string _ which acts on the hole moving in the plane with af / ao order _ is of the composite spin - orbital character_. this not only explains the peculiar correspondence between the orbital and spin - orbital model , but also shows that the spins play an active role in the lightly doped spin - orbital system .",
    "we remark that the orbitally induced string formation considered here could be understood as a topological effect .",
    "it happens even if the orbital excitation energy is turned to zero , i.e. , when the hole moves in the orbital sector incoherently .",
    "hence , the mere presence of orbitals is sufficient to obtain the ( almost ) classical behaviour of a hole doped into the gs with af / ao order .",
    "this result suggests that further investigation of the hole propagation in spin - orbital systems is a fascinating subject for future studies .",
    "spin - orbital entanglement discussed in this topical review concerns entanglement on the exchange bonds , similar to entanglement in e.g. spin singlets which build vb states @xcite .",
    "we have shown that this concept is important is several spin - orbital models and in general either the ground state or excited states are entangled .",
    "two recent examples of entangled ground states were presented : the kugel - khomskii model on a bilayer , and the spin - orbital @xmath27 model on the triangular lattice , in addition to the well known 1d su(2)@xmath134su(2 ) model .",
    "it may be expected that more spin - orbital model systems with entangled ground states will be found in the near future .",
    "whether or not such states are indeed realized in nature depends on the coupling to the lattice .",
    "for instance , the @xmath10 orbital order is robust in lamno@xmath1 @xcite and kcuf@xmath1 @xcite , and for this reason the ground states of these compounds are disentangled .",
    "we have also demonstrated that the goodenough - kanamori rules are violated in the regime of weak hund s exchange in several situations .",
    "it is in this regime that the mean field decoupling procedure of spin and orbital operators fails and the magnetic properties can be determined only by solving the full entangled spin - orbital many - body problem . also for weak ( or vanishing ) hund s exchange _ spin - orbital liquid _",
    "phase is stabilized by spin - orbital entanglement in the @xmath27 spin - orbital model on the triangular lattice .",
    "however , a frustrated lattice does not guarantee that a disordered spin - orbital liquid - like state arises .",
    "a good counterexample is the frustrated lattice of alkali @xmath0o@xmath29 hyperoxides ( with @xmath0=k , rb , cs ) , where the interactions induced by the lattices compete with the superexchange and stabilize the orbital order , lifting the geometric frustration of the lattice @xcite .",
    "then the spin - orbital interactions may be consideed as disentangled , and the goodenough - kanamori rules require certain reinterpretation .",
    "in fact , they have been generalized by including large interorbital hopping terms @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that ground states which contradict the celebrated goodenough - kanamori rules may appear in two different situations : ( @xmath3 ) either when quantum fluctuations in the spin - orbital system are strong and stabilize the entangled ground state with coexisting af and ao order , or ( @xmath4 ) when the af superexchange interactions follow from charge excitations in other orbitals not involved the actual orbital order , or ( @xmath5 ) when the coupling to the lattice stabilizes the ao order in the regime where the af spin correlations are expected due to superexchange . in these",
    "latter situation the ground state is more classical and not entangled as it follows from interactions induced by the lattice and not from the spin - orbital superexchange .",
    "also in the regime of large hund s exchange @xmath100 , ground states with coexisting fm and fo order may appear @xcite , similar to the fm / fo states in the su(2)@xmath161su(2 ) model .",
    "they contradict again the goodenough - kanamori rules , but are in fact disentangled  here quantum fluctuations are absent and play no role for their stability .    on the example of the @xmath0vo@xmath1 perovskites we have shown",
    "that the experimental data in this unique family of correlated oxides indicate that low - energy excited states are entangled and the energies of spin and orbital excitations are similar .",
    "this happens because lattice distortions and interactions of @xmath21 orbitals with jahn - teller modes are weak and only the electronic interactions such as superexchange decide about the system behaviour . in the @xmath0vo@xmath1 systems the temperature dependence of the optical spectral weight ,",
    "the phase diagram as a function of the ionic radius of @xmath0 ions , and the dimerized magnon excitations , are all determined by the presence of entangled states with low excitation energies .",
    "the interplay between spin , orbital and spin - orbital excitations poses a very interesting problem for future theoretical studies as well as an experimental challenge .",
    "we also point out that in case of fo order accompanied by af interactions , spin fluctuations couple to orbital excitations and thus they can not be considered separately @xcite , in spite of formal separation of spin and orbital degrees of freedom in the ground state",
    ". another important finding is recent observation that composite spin - orbital excitations fractionalize in the quasi-1d mott insulator sr@xmath29cuo@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the nature of spin - orbital excitations and the circumstances of their possible decay are very challenging and unresolved questions .",
    "the case considered here of a hole moving in the af / ao order @xcite seems to suggest that , at least in doped systems , spin - orbital excitations may play a very important role in transport as they may not decay and impose some topological constraints on carrier propagation .",
    "the present topical review focused on spin - orbital entanglement on the superexchange bonds , but a different kind of entanglement arises in presence of on - site relativistic spin - orbit interaction . in this case",
    "a kramers doublet gives the lowest energy states of a single ion and these states are next considered to derive interactions between neighbouring ions @xcite .",
    "such local on - site entangled states play an important role and decide about the magnetic properties of sr@xmath29iro@xmath30 with weak ferromagnetism and sr@xmath29vo@xmath30 with hidden spin - orbital order . in a 1d superexchange model with ising - like",
    "orbital superexchange locally entangled states introduce orbital dynamics and lead to a phase diagram with a novel phase having long - range nel order of spin and orbital angular momenta @xcite .",
    "excitations is such models are a challenge and they are under investigation at present . if localized states with an effective angular momentum @xmath569 at site @xmath3 ( with @xmath570 and @xmath571 being spin and orbital operators ) are considered , one finds a gapped spectrum at finite spin - orbit coupling @xcite .",
    "finally , we would like to emphasize that a better understanding of the concept of spin - orbital entanglement is important and could help to make progress in other fields as this subject is interdisciplinary . recently a scheme to generate spin - orbit - path hybrid greenberg - horne - zeilinger entanglement @xcite was proposed @xcite for photons which are entangled with different degrees of freedom . in quantum chemistry entanglement",
    "is considered in chemical bonds which are classified using measures of electron correlation @xcite and entanglement @xcite .",
    "spin - orbital - like entanglement is also applicable to nuclear systems , where nucleons possess as well two degrees of freedom  spin and isospin .",
    "it has been established that the entanglement length of the nucleons is significantly larger than that one expects @xcite .",
    "entanglement may also play an important role in quantum computations if the spin state used for information storage would be measured by investigating orbital qubits in entangled states @xcite .",
    "it is a great pleasure to thank particularly lou - fe feiner , peter horsch , giniyat khaliullin and jan zaanen for a very friendly collaboration over many years which significantly contributed to my present understanding of the subject .",
