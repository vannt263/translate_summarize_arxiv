    "there is an extensive literature on the topic of graph partitioning and community detection in networks  @xcite .",
    "this literature studies methods for partitioning the nodes in a network into a number of groups , often referred to as communities or clusters .",
    "the general idea is that nodes belonging to the same cluster should be relatively strongly connected to each other , while nodes belonging to different clusters should be only weakly connected .    which methods for graph partitioning and community detection perform best in practice ?",
    "the literature does not provide a clear answer to this question , and if the question can be answered at all , then most likely the answer will be dependent on the type of network that is being studied and on the type of partitioning that one is interested in .    in this paper , we therefore address the above question in one specific context .",
    "we are interested in grouping scientific publications into clusters and we expect each cluster to represent a set of publications that are topically related to each other . clustering scientific publications is a problem that has received a lot of attention in the bibliometric literature . in this literature ,",
    "publications have for instance been clustered based on co - occurring words in titles , abstracts , or full text  @xcite , based on co - citation or bibliographic coupling relations  @xcite , and sometimes even based on a combination of different types of relations  @xcite . following waltman and van eck  @xcite and boyack and klavans  @xcite , our interest in this paper is in clustering publications based on direct citation relations .",
    "direct citation relations are of special interest because they allow large sets of publications to be clustered in an efficient way .",
    "waltman and van eck for instance cluster ten million publications from the period 2001 - 2010 based on about hundred million citation relations between these publications . in this way",
    ", they obtain a highly detailed classification system of scientific literature covering all fields of science .",
    "the analysis presented in this paper focuses on systematically comparing the performance of a large number of clustering methods when applied to the problem of clustering scientific publications based on citation relations .",
    "the following clustering methods are included in the analysis : spectral methods  @xcite , modularity optimization  @xcite , map equation methods  @xcite , matrix factorization  @xcite , statistical methods  @xcite , link clustering  @xcite , label propagation  @xcite , random walks  @xcite , clique percolation  @xcite and expansion  @xcite , and selected other methods  @xcite .",
    "these are all methods that have been proposed during the past years in the literature on graph partitioning and community detection .    to evaluate the performance of the different clustering methods , we perform an in - depth analysis of the statistical properties of the clusterings obtained by each method . on the one hand we focus on general properties of the clusterings , but on the other hand we also consider a number of properties that are of special relevance in the context of citation networks of publications .",
    "however , to obtain a deep understanding of the differences between clustering methods , we believe that analyzing the statistical properties of clusterings is not sufficient . understanding the differences between clustering methods",
    "also requires an expert - based assessment of different clusterings .",
    "this is a challenging task that involves a number of practical difficulties , but in this paper we nevertheless make an attempt to perform such an expert - based assessment .",
    "the expert - based assessment is performed for publications in the field of library and information science , focusing on the subfield of scientometrics .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first discuss the data and methods included in our analysis .",
    "we then present the results of the analysis .",
    "we conclude the paper by providing a detailed discussion of our findings .",
    "below we first discuss the citation networks of publications that we consider in our analysis .",
    "we then discuss the clustering methods included in the analysis . finally , we discuss the criteria that we use for comparing the clustering methods .",
    "these criteria relate to the following four properties of a clustering method :    cluster sizes .",
    ": :    ideally the differences in the size of clusters should not be too    large .",
    "for instance , the largest cluster preferably should be no more    than an order of magnitude larger than the smallest cluster .",
    "small clusters . : :    for practical purposes , it is usually inconvenient to have a large    number of very small clusters",
    ". therefore the number of very small    clusters should be minimized as much as possible .",
    "clustering stability .",
    ": :    running the same clustering method multiple times may yield different    results ( due to random elements in many clustering methods ) , but the    results should be reasonably similar . likewise ,",
    "when small changes are    made to a citation network , this should not have too much effect on    the results of a clustering method .",
    "computing time .",
    ": :    preferably , a clustering method should be fast . especially in    applications to large citation networks the issue of computing time is    of significant importance .",
    "in addition to the above four properties , a fifth property for comparing clustering methods is the intuitive sensibility of the results provided by a method .",
    "experts should be able to interpret the clusters obtained from a clustering method in terms of meaningful research topics .",
    "we do not evaluate this fifth property using quantitative criteria . instead , our expert - based assessment of the results of different clustering methods is focused on this criterion .",

    "which methods for graph partitioning and community detection perform best for the purpose of grouping scientific publications into clusters ? in this paper , we have carried out an extensive analysis comparing the performance of a large number of methods .",
    "the methods have been applied to a number of networks of publications connected by direct citation relations .",
    "we have studied the statistical properties of the results provided by the different methods , and we have also performed an expert - based assessment of the results .    from a bibliometric point of view ,",
    "a good clustering of publications ideally should have a number of properties .",
    "first of all , although it is natural to expect that there will be larger and smaller clusters , it is inconvenient for practical purposes if there are very large differences in the size of clusters . as a rule of thumb , we ideally would like the difference in size between the largest and the smallest clusters to be no more than an order of magnitude .",
    "second , if it turns out to be inevitable that some publications end up in very small clusters , for instance because these publications have almost no citation relations with other publications , then at least we would prefer the number of publications assigned to these insignificant clusters to be as limited as possible .",
    "third , we would like the results of a clustering method to be reasonably stable .",
    "many methods include a random element , in which case different runs of a method may yield different results .",
    "however , running the same method multiple times should not affect the results too much , and the results should also be reasonably robust to small changes in a citation network of publications .",
    "fourth , the computing time of a clustering method should not be excessive .",
    "this is especially important when one aims to apply a method to networks consisting of large numbers of publications and citation relations . finally , and perhaps most importantly",
    ", the results produced by a clustering method should make intuitive sense .",
    "experts should be able to recognize the scientific topics represented by clusters of publications .",
    "our analysis shows that most clustering methods yield results with large differences in the size of clusters .",
    "the larger clusters are typically several orders of magnitude larger than the smaller clusters .",
    "sometimes more than half of the publications in a citation network are all assigned to the same cluster .",
    "this was for instance observed for the results obtained from the links and scp methods in the library & information science citation network .",
    "the only methods that yield clusters of more or less similar size are the spectral methods ( e.g. graclus ) .",
    "these methods produce results that are characterized by a much more uniform cluster size distribution . depending on the cluster size distribution and also on the resolution of a clustering",
    ", there can be large differences in the share of all citation relations that are covered by clusters .",
    "coverage for instance ranges from less than @xmath15 to more than @xmath16 in the library & information science citation network .",
    "clustering methods also often assign a significant share of the publications in a citation network to very small clusters . in the library & information science citation network ,",
    "the graclus and infomap methods for instance assign more than @xmath17 of the publications to clusters consisting of fewer than @xmath18 publications .",
    "the stability or robustness of the results obtained from a clustering method also partly depends on the size of the clusters produced by the method .",
    "not surprisingly , methods that produce one or more very large clusters tend to yield relatively robust results .",
    "furthermore , in the library & information science citation network , spectral and statistical methods ( e.g. graclus and oslom ) produce results with a relatively low robustness , while infomap and modularity optimization yield quite robust results .    in terms of computing time , there are substantial differences between the various methods . for instance , clustering the publications in the library & information science citation network takes more than @xmath19 times longer for the slowest method than for the fastest method .",
    "modularity optimization methods ( e.g. louvain ) , label propagation ( e.g. bpa ) , and spectral analysis methods ( e.g. graclus ) perform best in terms of computing time .",
    "other methods require a more significant amount of computing time , making them less suitable for applications on large citation networks .",
    "turning now to the expert - based assessment of the results produced by different clustering methods for the scientometrics subfield within the library & information science citation network , we find that the infomap and metimap ( i.e. infomap combined with spectral method metis ) methods give the most satisfactory results , with a slight preference for the infomap results over the results obtained from metimap .",
    "other methods , such as oslom and louvain , provide less satisfactory results .",
    "our analysis seems to provide most support for the use of infomap and related methods such as metimap to cluster the publications in a citation network .",
    "infomap has the best performance in our expert - based assessment , and it yields quite robust results . compared with some of the other methods , infomap has a relatively high computing time , but this can be overcome by using metimap in larger citation networks .",
    "the price that we pay for the good performance of infomap seems to be the assignment of a relatively large number of publications to small clusters .",
    "paying this price seems necessary to obtain high - quality clustering results . in large citation networks",
    ", a post - processing procedure can be applied to minimize the number of small clusters , but the effect of the use of such a procedure on the quality of the clustering results is not clear .",
    "the promising results obtained for infomap are in line with earlier findings reported in the network science literature  @xcite .",
    "although infomap has been introduced in the bibliometric literature  @xcite and has been applied to citation networks in a number of studies  @xcite , the method has not yet gained a widespread popularity in the bibliometric community , where researchers seem to prefer the use of modularity - based methods .",
    "our findings suggest that the bibliometric community could benefit from exploring the use of other clustering methods in addition to modularity - based methods .",
    "infomap seems to be of particular interest .",
    "future studies should reveal whether infomap indeed consistently performs well in applications to citation networks .",
    "[ [ limitations - of - the - analysis . ] ] limitations of the analysis .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    it is important to emphasize that our results should be interpreted cautiously because of a number of limitations of our analysis .",
    "one obvious limitation is that , despite the large number of clustering methods included in our analysis , we did not exhaustively cover all methods proposed in the literature .",
    "the selection of the methods included in our analysis was made based on the popularity of a method and to some degree also on our familiarity with a method .",
    "in addition , the availability of source code played a role as well .",
    "many methods discussed in the literature are not included in our analysis . in particular , methods that produce overlapping clusters  @xcite or clusters at multiple levels of resolution  @xcite",
    "are not covered .",
    "also , we for instance do not cover some recently developed principled methods based on statistical inference  @xcite .",
    "a second limitation is that each clustering method was applied using the default parameter settings .",
    "we did not try to optimize the parameter values of the different methods .",
    "so the performance of some methods may have been better if we had used optimized parameter values for these methods .",
    "some methods for instance have a parameter that can be used to fine - tune the level of granularity of the clustering results .",
    "one could use such a parameter to try to obtain results at similar levels of granularity for different methods , and in that way a more accurate comparison between different methods may be possible .",
    "we did not explore this possibility in our analysis , but we do consider this an interesting direction for future research .",
    "we note that the clustering method proposed by two of us in an earlier paper  @xcite requires a careful choice of parameter values . for this reason ,",
    "this method was not included in our present analysis .",
    "a third limitation is our exclusive focus on undirected and unweighted networks of direct citation relations between publications .",
    "we did not consider the possibility of taking into account the direction of a citation relation , and we did not test the effect of assigning weights to citation relations  @xcite .",
    "we also did not study the use of indirect citation relations between publications , in particular co - citation and bibliographic coupling relations .",
    "finally , we should emphasize the limitations of our expert - based assessment of the clustering results obtained for the scientometrics subfield within the library & information science citation network .",
    "the expert - based assessment was carried out at a high level of detail by two experts with an extensive expertise in the field of scientometrics .",
    "nevertheless , any expert - based assessment will necessarily be of a subjective nature , and different experts therefore may not always reach the same conclusions .",
    "moreover , experts typically have a deep understanding of the literature only in a relatively small area of science .",
    "this for instance explains why in our expert - based assessment we could not cover the entire field of library and information science but only the subfield of scientometrics .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to say to what extent conclusions reached for such a relatively small area of science can be expected to generalize to other areas .",
    "for this reason , the findings of our expert - based assessment should be interpreted with some caution .",
