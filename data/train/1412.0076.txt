    "`` maximal '' means the dirichlet form having the maximal domain which we learnt earlier from fukushima ( cf .",

    "we are interested in the stability speed , for instance , the @xmath0-exponential convergence rate @xmath20 : @xmath21 then , it turns out that the largest rate @xmath22 coincides with @xmath23 given in ( [ 01 ] ) ( cf . [",
    "[ cmf04 ] ; theorem 9.1 ] ) .",
    "we can state one of our recent results as follows .",

    "assume that @xmath26",
    ". then the general case can be done by an approximating procedure . the optimal constant actually describes an eigenvalue @xmath27 defined by @xmath28",

    "this leads to the principal eigenvalue of @xmath37 : @xmath39 where @xmath40\\cap { \\scr c}^2(-m , n ) : f(-m)=f(n)=0,\\ ; f|_{(-m , n)}>0\\big\\}.\\ ] ] note that the zero - point of @xmath29 in the original eigenequation for @xmath18 is located inside of the interval @xmath9 , not explicitly known ; the zero - points for the eigenvalue @xmath41 are located at the boundaries @xmath42 and @xmath43 only .",
    "this is the advantage of @xmath37 .",
    "however , there is an extra term @xmath44 in operator @xmath37 which costs some trouble as usual . to avoid this , we rewrite @xmath18 as @xmath45",
    "then we define a dual operator of @xmath18 as follows .",
    "@xmath46 i.e. an exchange of @xmath2 and @xmath47 .",
    "more explicitly , @xmath48 next , define @xmath49 in view of the next result which is crucial in proving theorem [ t1 - 1 ] , it is clear that we have thus removed the extra term @xmath44 in the operator @xmath37 .    here ,",
    "in proving @xmath50 , we have used a mathematical tool  the coupling technique ( cf . or ) .",
    "we have also used another tool  dual technique in proving @xmath51 .",
    "it is interesting that they are the main tools used in the study on interacting particle systems ( cf . and references therein ) .",
    "to obtain the basic estimates listed in theorem [ t1 - 1 ] , we need one more mathematical tool  the capacitary method .",
    "the next result is taken from fukushima & uemura and , see also .",
    "@xmath52    the space @xmath53 can be very general , for instance @xmath54 or the orlicz spaces . in the present context ,",
    "@xmath55 , @xmath56 is the closure of @xmath57 with respect to the norm @xmath58 : @xmath59 , and @xmath60    note that we have the universal factor 2 here and the isoperimetric constant @xmath61 has a very compact form . we now need to compute the capacity only .",
    "the problem is that the capacity is usually not explicitly computable .",
    "for instance , at the moment , we do not know how to compute it for schrdinger operators even for the elliptic operators having killings .",
    "very lucky , we are able to compute the capacity for the one - dimensional elliptic operators .",
    "the result has a simple expression : @xmath62^{-1}\\|\\mathbbold{1}_{(x,\\ , y)}\\|_{{\\mathbb b}}.\\ ] ] it looks strange to have double inverse here .",
    "so , making inverse in both sides , we get @xmath63\\,\\|\\mathbbold{1}_{(x , y)}\\|_{{\\mathbb b}}^{-1}.\\ ] ] applying this result to @xmath64 , we obtain the solution to the case having double dirichlet boundaries : @xmath65 and @xmath66\\ , { \\mu ( x , y)^{-1}}.\\ ] ]    applying the last result to the dual process , we have not only @xmath67 but also @xmath68\\ , \\mu^ * ( x , y)^{-1}\\\\ & = \\inf_{x < y}\\big[\\mu(-m , x)^{-1 } + \\mu(y , n)^{-1}\\big]\\ , { \\hat\\nu}(x , y)^{-1}\\\\ & = \\kz^{-2}. \\endaligned\\ ] ] we have thus arrived at the assertion of theorem [ t1 - 1 ] . refer to [ [ cmf10 ] ;  10 ] and for more details .    to conclude this section",
    ", we remark that the use of the capacity is natural in the higher dimensions , since in which the boundary may be very complicated .",
    "however , it seems unnecessary to use it in the present one - dimensional situation .",
    "this leads to a direct proof of theorem [ t1 - 1 ] , given in the next section , without using the three mathematical tools just mentioned above .",
    "we now return to our general inequality ( [ 01 ] ) .",
    "first , we need a measure @xmath47 , as in the last section , deduced from @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath69 be the absolutely continuous part of @xmath3 with respect to the lebesgue measure .",

    "in particular ( as the limit of @xmath73 ) , @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the conjugate of @xmath76 : @xmath77 .    here",
    "are some remarks on theorem [ t2 - 1 ] .    * the isoperimetric constants @xmath78 and @xmath79 are expressed explicitly in measures @xmath2 and @xmath47 . * the boundaries @xmath42 and @xmath43 symmetric in the formulas of @xmath78 and @xmath79 . *",
    "even through @xmath80 in general , but the rough ratio @xmath81 of the upper and lower bounds is still @xmath82 .",
    "* when @xmath83 , we have @xmath84 * ignoring the @xmath85-term in the expression of @xmath78 or @xmath79 , we obtain @xmath86^{1/ { p^*}}\\,\\mu ( y , n)^{1/ q}.\\ ] ] similarly , ignoring the @xmath87-term in the expression of @xmath78 or @xmath79 , we obtain @xmath88 we have thus returned to one of the main results in the study of hardy - type inequalities .",
    "there is a long history about the development of theorem [ t2 - 2 ] .",
    "the reader is urged to refer to and for a long list of references including five books .",
    "having the experience in proving theorem [ t1 - 1 ] and known the history of theorem [ t2 - 2 ] , it is hardly imaginable how to find a direct proof of theorem [ t1 - 1 ] , or even much more general theorem [ t2 - 2 ] , without using capacity . to have a test ,",
    "let us introduce the proof of a hard part  the upper estimate of theorem [ t2 - 2 ] .",
    "the idea is starting from theorem [ t2 - 2 ] . for this , we split the interval @xmath9 into two parts : @xmath89 and @xmath90 ,        denote by @xmath91 the optimal constant on the left subinterval @xmath92 and by @xmath93 the one on the right subinterval @xmath90 with the same boundary condition @xmath94 .",
    "then , we can rewrite theorem [ t2 - 2 ] as follows .    :",
    "@xmath95 .    rewrite @xmath78 as @xmath96 by proportional property , we have @xmath97 here @xmath98 and similarly @xmath99 .",
    "hence ( omit what in @xmath100 ) @xmath101 then @xmath102\\bigwedge \\bigg[\\sup_{y\\ge\\uz }   \\frac{{\\hat\\nu}(\\uz , y)}{\\qz(y)}\\bigg]\\bigg\\}. \\endaligned\\ ] ] making power @xmath103 on both sides , by definition of @xmath104 , we obtain @xmath105 here a problem appears : we need @xmath106 rather than @xmath107 on the right - hand side . to overcome this",
    ", we assume that @xmath108 .",
    "then , there exists @xmath109 such that @xmath110 . therefore @xmath111 and",
    "then @xmath112 here each step holds for all @xmath113 except the last one . in which , some additional work is required , due to the appearance of @xmath114 rather than @xmath8 only .",
    "we prove the conclusion first for @xmath115 and then extend it to @xmath116 , even to a large class of normed linear space @xmath53 , as used in theorem [ t1 - 3 ] , using a known lifting procedure ( cf .",
    "[ [ cmf05 ] ;  6.3 ] ) .",
    "note that in the proof above , we use a bridge @xmath117 to combine the known results on two subintervals together .",
    "but then remove it , otherwise , @xmath118 for instance , may not be computable .",
    "nevertheless , it should be understandable that the present analytic proof does not use the coupling , duality , or capacitary techniques .",
    "actually , much more topics are studied in : the bilateral dirichlet boundaries , logarithmic sobolev inequalities , nash inequalities , and so on .",
    "note that for two given numbers having smaller ratio , their difference can be still quite big .",
    "hence , it is meaningful to improve the basic estimates introduced in the last two sections . in this section ,",
    "we show the possibility in doing so by a simplest example : @xmath119 and @xmath120 on @xmath121 . we need to consider the following hardy - type inequality f_l^q()a f_l^p ( ) , f(0)=0 only since the other cases ( the ergodic case in particular )",
    "can be reduced to this one by symmetry .",
    "the basic estimates for the optimal constant @xmath12 in ( [ 03 ] ) are given in theorem [ t2 - 2 ] .",
    "next , since @xmath113 , we may write @xmath125 for some @xmath126 . in figures 3 and 4 ,",
    "there are six curves , three of them are upper estimates and two of them are lower ones .",
    "the third curve from the bottom is the exact one ; the top and the bottom curves consist of the basic estimates of the exact one . the other three curves are the improvements of the basic estimates .            .",
    "this short note introduces an example to illustrate the great help we have obtained from professor masatoshi fukushima in the past decades .",
    "it is a nice chance to express our deepest thanks to him .",
