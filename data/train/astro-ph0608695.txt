    "the `` refractive index '' caused by a medium has a strong impact on neutrino flavour oscillations  @xcite .",
    "this matter effect is a standard ingredient for neutrino oscillations in laboratory experiments and in astrophysical environments .",
    "however , when neutrinos themselves form a significant `` background medium '' as in the early universe or in core - collapse supernovae , the oscillation equations become nonlinear , sometimes resulting in surprising collective phenomena .",
    "based on pantaleone s key observation that neutrinos as a background medium produce a flavour off - diagonal refractive index  @xcite , the behaviour of dense neutrino gases was investigated in a series of papers by samuel , kosteleck and pantaleone  @xcite .",
    "two classes of collective effects were identified in these papers : we shall call them `` synchronised '' and `` bipolar '' oscillations , respectively .",
    "synchronised oscillations occur when the neutrino - neutrino interaction potential is large compared to the ordinary oscillation frequencies in vacuum or in a medium , and a sufficiently large asymmetry exists between the neutrino and antineutrino distributions . as a result ,",
    "all neutrinos and antineutrinos oscillate with the same frequency that is a certain average of the ordinary oscillation frequencies . in the spin - precession analogy of flavour oscillations ,",
    "the flavour polarisation vectors of all neutrino modes form one big spin that precesses in a weak `` external magnetic field . ''",
    "this big spin is held together by the strong `` internal magnetic field '' formed in flavour space by the strong neutrino - neutrino interaction  @xcite .",
    "various qualitative and quantitative aspects of synchronised oscillations and applications to neutrino flavour oscillations in the early universe  @xcite were studied a few years ago , motivated by the question if neutrinos with chemical potentials reach flavour equilibrium in the early universe before the epoch of big - bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "much less attention has been paid to bipolar flavour conversions , but very recently it has been recognised that this peculiar phenomenon likely plays a crucial role for supernova neutrino oscillations  @xcite . in the simplest case , bipolar oscillations occur in a dense gas of equal numbers of neutrinos and antineutrinos of the same flavour . for a suitable mass hierarchy ,",
    "even a small mixing angle can cause a complete conversion of both neutrinos and antineutrinos to the other flavour .",
    "we stress that a non - vanishing vacuum mixing angle is pivotal ; bipolar oscillations , although a quasi self - induced effect , will not occur if the vacuum mixing angle strictly vanishes .",
    "the relevant conditions for bipolar conversions probably occur for neutrinos streaming off a collapsed supernova core where one expects a hierarchy of average energies @xmath0 with @xmath1  @xcite . assuming equal luminosities for all species , the number flux of , say , @xmath2 and @xmath3 is each smaller than that of @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively . for the inverted mass hierarchy one would then expect bipolar oscillations driven by the `` atmospheric '' neutrino mass difference and the small mixing angle @xmath6 . and @xmath7 streaming off a supernova core have equal spectra , behave equally in ordinary matter , and are known to be nearly maximally mixed so that the 23-mixing is not relevant in this context .",
    "the `` solar '' mass difference is much smaller and the corresponding hierarchy is normal so that 12-mixing is expected to lead to less prominent effects at larger distances from the supernova core . in general , however , one would need to perform a three - flavour treatment . ]",
    "bipolar flavour conversion occurs when the neutrino - neutrino interaction energy , @xmath8 , exceeds a typical vacuum oscillation frequency @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , the neutrino - antineutrino asymmetry must not be too large in a sense to be quantified later .",
    "once these conditions are met , bipolar oscillations take place for astonishingly small values of the mixing angle and are nearly unaffected by the presence of an ordinary background medium , even if it is much denser than the neutrino gas  @xcite .",
    "these oscillations are also unrelated to a mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) resonance of the ordinary background medium .",
    "the notion of `` bipolar oscillations '' originates from the claimed numerical observation that the flavour polarisation vectors of all neutrinos and of all antineutrinos align together to form two `` block spins '' that evolve separately .",
    "indeed , the analytic descriptions of refs .",
    "@xcite were based on the study of a system of one neutrino and one antineutrino polarisation vector that were taken to represent , respectively , the complete ensemble of neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "we find that this description of bipolar oscillations is incorrect and actually has never been explicitly demonstrated in the literature .",
    "in fact , each mode of the neutrino and antineutrino ensemble evolves differently and the term `` bipolar '' is a misnomer . on the other hand ,",
    "the behaviour _ is _ bipolar in the sense that neutrinos and antineutrinos oscillate in `` opposite directions '' and thus form two separate cohorts , even if they do not form two block spins .",
    "therefore , we use the term `` bipolar '' to describe this collective phenomenon .",
    "the newly recognised role of bipolar oscillations represents a change of paradigm for supernova neutrino oscillations .",
    "inspired by these exciting developments we turn to an analytic study of bipolar oscillations with the aim of providing a simple qualitative and quantitative understanding of the salient features of this puzzling effect .",
    "analytic solutions for certain cases have already been provided in the literature  @xcite .",
    "however , a judicious choice of variables enables us to write the equations of motion in the form of an ordinary pendulum .",
    "this picture allows one to grasp the salient features of the bipolar phenomenon at a single glance .",
    "moreover , it allows one to calculate explicitly the dependence of the bipolar oscillation period on the vacuum mixing angle and on the density of an ordinary background medium .",
    "when the fluxes of neutrinos and antineutrinos are not equal ( as expected for supernova neutrinos ) , the equations for the flavour pendulum remain the same , but the asymmetric initial conditions imply the presence of an inner angular momentum ( i.e. , spin ) of the pendulum : the system is equivalent to a spinning top subject to a torque .",
    "if the top is not spinning , we simply recover the motion of an ordinary spherical pendulum ( i.e. , bipolar behaviour of a symmetric @xmath10-@xmath11 system ) .",
    "otherwise the motion is more complicated",
    ". if the spin is sufficiently large , the top precesses in the force field exerting the torque ( i.e. , synchronised oscillations ) . if the spin is too small , the top wobbles or even completely turns over ( i.e. , bipolar behaviour of an asymmetric system ) .    in the most general case , however , different neutrino modes have different energies and , in a non - isotropic medium such as that encountered by neutrinos streaming off a supernova core , couple to each other with different strengths ( `` multi - angle case '' ) . in this situation",
    "kinematical decoherence rather than collective oscillations can obtain and is an unavoidable outcome certainly in the simplest system of equal numbers of neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "however , in the more realistic case of unequal neutrino and antineutrino fluxes in conjunction with a slowly varying effective neutrino density , collective oscillations often still obtain .",
    "the exact criteria that determine if kinematical decoherence or collective oscillations occur remain to be understood .",

    "[ fig : muradius ] .",
    "furthermore , we assume that ( i ) we have equal fluxes of neutrinos and antineutrinos , ( ii ) all of them are initially in the same flavour , ( iii ) the mass hierarchy is inverted , and ( iv ) the mixing angle is @xmath162 , representing a possibly small @xmath6 mixing angle .",

    "moreover , we observe that the oscillation amplitude declines as a function of radius so that after a few tens of km we obtain complete flavour conversion .",
    "the question then is : can the decline of the upper envelope of the survival probability be explained by way of the flavour pendulum ?    in the pendulum language , we start at small radii with the usual full oscillations .",
    "however , while the pendulum oscillates , we slowly reduce @xmath89 , i.e. , we increase adiabatically the moment of inertia @xmath59 . since the kinetic energy is @xmath164 and the angular momentum @xmath76 is conserved , an increase in @xmath165 corresponds to a decrease in the kinetic energy .",
    "this is akin to a dancer who can speed up or slow down a pirouette by changing the moment of inertia .",
    "the continuous decrease in @xmath89 and hence in the kinetic energy , however , means that during subsequent swings , the pendulum will be unable to reach its previous height .",
    "this explains the general feature of a declining upper envelope in the survival probability caused by a decreasing @xmath89 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : snbimodal ] ) .",
    "it is important to note that the potential energy is independent of @xmath89 ; it depends only on @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , our pendulum is not like a gravitational one where the potential energy would be affected by a changing mass .",

    "the kinetic energy at a given time is @xmath166 .",
    "the conservation of angular momentum , except for the natural pendulum motion , implies that a sudden change @xmath167 at some time @xmath15 causes a change in kinetic energy of @xmath168 .",
    "for example , if we change @xmath89 by @xmath167 when the pendulum swings past its lowest point at which the kinetic energy is maximal , then the relative change is @xmath169 .",
    "however , @xmath89 decreases slowly compared to the oscillation period so that we may assume a linear decline .",
    "therefore , the change of @xmath170 occurs over the entire oscillation period and thus must be weighted with a factor proportional to @xmath171 over one oscillation period .",
    "if the oscillation is approximately harmonic , we have @xmath172 with @xmath69 the pendulum s natural frequency .",
    "the average of @xmath173 is @xmath174 .",
    "therefore , if over one period @xmath89 decreases by a factor @xmath175 where @xmath176 , then @xmath177 .",
    "in other words , @xmath170 is reduced by a factor @xmath178 so that @xmath179 .",
    "the maximal kinetic energy equals the maximal potential energy minus its minimum , achieved within one oscillation .",
    "the potential energy normalised such that its minimum is zero , @xmath180 for small mixing angles and for large @xmath92 , gives us the projection of the summed polarisation vector @xmath39 on the flavour axis . therefore , the upper envelope of the survival probability in fig .",
    "[ fig : snbimodal ] should scale with @xmath181 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mudecline ] we show the same survival probabilities with @xmath182 as a radial coordinate .",
    "the decline is indeed nearly linear , especially for small - amplitude oscillations ( toward the right side of the plot ) where the pendulum oscillations are more nearly  harmonic .",
    "our pendulum analogy elegantly explains the most puzzling feature of the bipolar supernova neutrino oscillations , i.e. , that they actually lead to flavour conversion rather than permanent bipolar oscillations .",
    "we are simply seeing the relaxation of the pendulum to its downward rest position as kinetic energy is extracted by the reduction of the neutrino - neutrino interaction potential and thus the increase of the pendulum s inertia .",
    "the behaviour of neutrinos streaming off a supernova core looks , however , rather different from this simple picture .",
    "besides the dependence of @xmath89 on the radius , another crucial feature is the initial neutrino - antineutrino asymmetry ; the number flux of @xmath4 is the largest , that of @xmath5 smaller , and those of the other species yet smaller but equal to one another .",
    "we represent this situation by the initial conditions @xmath183 and @xmath184 . the equations of motion for this system are simply those given in sec .",

    "observe that the initial flavour - lepton asymmetry is conserved so that there remains a net flux of @xmath4 originally set at @xmath163  km .",
    "otherwise there is complete flavour conversion over a length scale given by the decrease of @xmath89 as a function of radius .",
    "similar results are found in detailed numerical studies within the `` one - angle approximation '' where the neutrino interaction strength is taken equal for all modes ( fig .",

    "@xcite ) . changing the vacuum mixing angle and adding normal matter causes only the minor logarithmic changes predicted earlier .",
    "the behaviour of the neutrino ensemble between the neutrino sphere at 10  km and @xmath185  km is explained by synchronised oscillations due to the neutrino - antineutrino asymmetry and the large value of @xmath89 in this region . beyond this",
    "we enter the bipolar regime out to about 200  km when vacuum oscillations take over . in other words , the flavour evolution of neutrinos streaming off a supernova core",
    "are determined by a transition from synchronised oscillations at small radii ( large @xmath89 ) , bipolar oscillations at intermediate radii ( intermediate @xmath89 ) , and ordinary vacuum oscillations at large radii ( small @xmath89 ) as first stressed in ref .",
    "if ordinary matter is included , it affects the synchronised region at small radii in the usual way by making the effective mixing angle smaller , and likewise at large radii where no collective effects occur .",
    "it is only in the intermediate , bipolar oscillation regime where ordinary matter has no significant impact on the system .",
    "confusingly , the bipolar behaviour does not correspond to the limit of large or small neutrino densities ; it corresponds to _ intermediate _ densities  @xcite .",
    "we have already explained the decline of the upper envelope of these curves in the bipolar regime which should scale as @xmath181 . to confirm this behaviour",
    "once more we show in fig .",

    "the decline of both the upper and lower envelopes are stunningly linear .",
    "this reflects the small - amplitude nature of the oscillations which are now nearly harmonic so that our previous argument works better here than in the previous section .",
    "the lepton asymmetry of the neutrino flux is crucial for understanding a realistic supernova case . to develop a first understanding of this situation we consider an asymmetric ensemble with the initial condition @xmath186 where @xmath187 .",
    "if the @xmath10-@xmath10 interaction is sufficiently strong , the two polarisation vectors will hang together by their `` internal magnetic field '' and all vectors @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath39 , and @xmath34 precess around @xmath33 with the same synchronised frequency . using @xmath188 and @xmath189",
    ", we thus find the usual result @xmath190 observe that the synchronised motion is faster for more symmetric systems !    to achieve synchronised oscillations , the internal frequencies of the system , i.e. , their precession frequency around a common spin , must exceed the slow precession around the external magnetic field @xmath191 . in our case of two polarisation vectors ,",
    "the internal motion is described by @xmath192 .",

    "when this condition is violated , the motion becomes bipolar .",
    "actually , this condition derives from an even simpler argument if we consider the total energy of the system , @xmath196 synchronised oscillations require that the energy of the system be dominated by the spin - spin interaction , the second term . assuming a small vacuum mixing angle so that @xmath33 is nearly aligned with the initial polarisation vectors , and observing that @xmath197 and @xmath198 , the requirement that the spin - spin term dominates is @xmath199 , identical with eq .",
    "( [ eq : synchsimple ] ) up to a multiplicative factor .    in other words ,",

    "the bipolar regime corresponds to the intermediate range where the relative magnitude of the different energy contributions depends on the orientation of the polarisation vectors . in summary ,",
    "bipolar oscillations are expected when @xmath201 and thus occur for an intermediate strength of the neutrino - neutrino interaction , i.e. , an intermediate range of neutrino densities as first discussed in ref .",
    "the exact numerical factor on the r.h.s .  of this equation is taken from eq .",
    "( [ eq : bipolcondition ] ) below .",
    "this simple reasoning gives us the correct scale for the transition between synchronised and bipolar oscillations , but does not explain the nature of the transition .",
    "the two oscillation modes must be extreme cases of a continuum , yet the nature of the intermediate cases is not obvious .",
    "it turns out that this continuum has a straightforward physical interpretation that is quite illuminating for an understanding of the entire system .    to this end",
    "we note that the asymmetric system is described by the same equations of motion ( [ eq : eom5 ] ) for @xmath43 and @xmath34 as the symmetric case , and @xmath202 is likewise conserved .",
    "the new feature here is the initial condition @xmath203 and @xmath204 , so that eq .",

    "the first term in the expression corresponds to the orbital angular momentum as before , while the second term plays the role of an inner angular momentum ( i.e. , spin ) of the pendulum s bob .",
    "this spin is always along the direction @xmath209 , implying that we should think of the system as a spinning top mounted in a way that its axis of rotation can swing like a pendulum .",
    "if the top has no spin ( i.e. , @xmath210 ) , it acts as an ordinary spherical pendulum .    starting with the equation of motion @xmath211 and observing that @xmath212 , we find @xmath213 for the case @xmath210 , we recover the equation of motion of a pendulum swinging in the plane defined by @xmath33 and the initial vector @xmath214 which we always choose to be in the @xmath14-direction .",
    "conversely , if @xmath89 is so large that we can neglect the first term , we are back to a spin - precession equation with a precession frequency @xmath215 . for @xmath216",
    "we have @xmath217 so @xmath218 is indeed equal to @xmath191 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : omegasynch ] ) .",
    "the extreme cases thus have an intuitive interpretation .",
    "synchronised oscillations correspond to the flavour top spinning so fast that its response to the force field is precession , just like a spun - up top on a flat table surface . on the other hand ,",
    "if the top spins slowly ( corresponding to the case of a small neutrino asymmetry ) , then it swings like an ordinary pendulum ; the inner angular momentum in this case has little impact , and we are in the bipolar mode .",
    "let us consider the asymmetric system in more detail .",
    "several conserved quantities are apparent .",
    "one is the energy of the system , @xmath219 where we have added a constant to the potential energy such that it vanishes when the pendulum is oriented opposite to the force field .",
    "the other conserved quantity is the projection of @xmath34 in the @xmath33 direction , corresponding to the conservation of that component of the angular momentum parallel to the force field and which is thus not subject to a torque .",
    "the conservation of angular momentum implies that the initial lepton asymmetry can not be changed beyond the amount caused by ordinary vacuum oscillations . in all practical cases we begin with @xmath34 oriented along the @xmath14-axis , while @xmath33 is tilted by @xmath220 . if @xmath22 is small , the initial neutrino asymmetry is almost perfectly conserved .",
    "thus the self - interacting system can not stimulate an exotically large flavour conversion effect .",
    "if the spin is not quite fast enough for perfect precession , the overall motion is a wobble .",
    "the spinning top starts in a nearly upright position , its axis pointing nearly to the north pole .",
    "it will tilt a bit until it reaches a certain latitude , when its motion reverses back to the north pole .",
    "the latitude of reversal will lie further south if either or both of @xmath221 and @xmath89 is smaller .",
    "in other words , a smaller @xmath10-@xmath10 term makes the system `` more bipolar '' .",
    "a more symmetric system ( smaller @xmath221 ) is also more bipolar .",
    "the southernmost position the pendulum can reach is defined by energy and angular momentum conservation . as an example , we take the mixing angle to be very small so that @xmath33 is very close to the @xmath14-direction . in this approximation ,",

    "[ fig : musurvival ] , depends on the details of how the system enters the bipolar regime . if the mixing angle is large , bipolar oscillations begin almost immediately so that the amplitude of the oscillations will be small . if the mixing angle is small , the delayed onset of the first bipolar swing allows @xmath89 to decrease further , thereby resulting in a more southern turning point .",

    "@xcite show that neutrinos streaming off a supernova core are sometimes quite well represented by the single - angle case , i.e. , collective behaviour rather than quick kinematical decoherence appears to be more generic . again , the main differences to a simple symmetric system are twofold : there is a neutrino - antineutrino asymmetry and the effective density declines with radius .",

    "a dedicated research project is required to develop a deeper understanding of the conditions that determine if the system evolves as as single collective system in the form of the flavour pendulum , or if it kinematically decoheres in that the individual polarisation vectors of the different modes are `` randomised '' in flavour space .",

    "the inverted mass hierarchy corresponds to the pendulum starting in a near upright position , with the excursion angle growing exponentially until the pendulum makes an almost complete swing .",
    "conversely , if it starts in a nearly vertical downward position ( i.e. , normal mass hierarchy ) , the system behaves as a harmonic oscillator .    for the inverted case , the time for a complete swing is given by the pendulum s oscillation period times a factor depending on the logarithm of the initial excursion angle which is nearly identical with twice the vacuum mixing angle",
    "therefore , the bipolar conversion is delayed by the logarithm of the small vacuum mixing angle . likewise , we derived an analytic solution for the case when ordinary matter is present and showed that it affects the bipolar conversion time also only logarithmically .",
    "if the vacuum oscillation frequencies are different for different modes , one can not represent the ensemble by two `` block spins . ''",

    "rather , it evolves such that the potential and kinetic energy of the pendulum remain equipartitioned , signifying that the system remains at the edge of the bipolar condition throughout its evolution and is hence better immuned to decoherence .",

    "close to the neutrino sphere , the oscillations are synchronised up to a few tens of kilometres , then they enter the bipolar regime , and finally , beyond 100200 km , ordinary oscillations occur  @xcite .",
    "ordinary matter effects modify the oscillations in the usual way both in the synchronised regime and far away where collective effects are irrelevant , whereas in the intermediate regime of bipolar oscillations ordinary matter has no significant impact .",
    "this counter - intuitive situation was conjectured and numerically observed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in our model of a flavour pendulum the impact of ordinary matter can be calculated analytically .",
    "note that while the bipolar behaviour extends over a large range in radius outside the neutrino sphere , we have explicitly assumed in our treatment that the system consists of only two flavours because only one mass splitting is of importance .",
    "however , it could well be that the solar mass difference @xmath373 can not be ignored in the whole region",
    ". if this is the case a full three - flavour description must be employed , and new phenomena might arise .",

    "<S> neutrino - neutrino interactions can lead to collective flavour conversion effects in supernovae and in the early universe . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the case of `` bipolar '' oscillations , where a dense gas of neutrinos and antineutrinos in equal numbers completely converts from one flavour to another even if the mixing angle is small , is equivalent to a pendulum in flavour space . </S>",
    "<S> bipolar flavour conversion corresponds to the swinging of the pendulum , which begins in an unstable upright position ( the initial flavour ) , and passes through momentarily the vertically downward position ( the other flavour ) in the course of its motion . </S>",
    "<S> the time scale to complete one cycle of oscillation depends logarithmically on the vacuum mixing angle . </S>",
    "<S> likewise , the presence of an ordinary medium can be shown analytically to contribute to a logarithmic increase in the bipolar conversion period . </S>",
    "<S> we further find that a more complex ( and realistic ) system of unequal numbers of neutrinos and antineutrinos is analogous to a spinning top subject to a torque . </S>",
    "<S> this analogy easily explains how such a system can oscillate in both the bipolar and the synchronised mode , depending on the neutrino density and the size of the neutrino - antineutrino asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> our simple model applies strictly only to isotropic neutrino gasses . in more general cases , and especially for neutrinos streaming from a supernova core , different modes couple to each other with unequal strength , an effect that can lead to kinematical decoherence in flavour space rather than collective oscillations . </S>",
