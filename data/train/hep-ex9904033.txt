    "when studying observables in the process @xmath0 , it is found that the perturbative qcd predictions have to be complemented by non - perturbative corrections of the form @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the centre - of - mass energy @xmath3 , and the power @xmath4 depends on the particular observable . for fully inclusive observables such as the total cross section @xmath5 , however , for less inclusive ones such as event shape variables the power is much smaller , typically @xmath6 .",
    "so for those observables non - perturbative effects can be sizeable , e.g. , at lep1 energies corrections of 5 - 10% are found . since these variables are extensively used for determinations , non - perturbative effects have to be well understood . until recently they have been determined from qcd - inspired monte carlo ( mc ) models of hadronization , however",
    ", this method leads to model dependence and thus limitations in the precision of the  measurements .",
    "the new approach of power law corrections to event shapes , pioneered by dokshitzer and webber @xcite , could lead to improvements in this respect .",
    "the event shape variables studied are thrust , c - parameter , heavy jet mass and total and wide jet broadening .",
    "these are infrared and collinear safe variables , and perturbative predictions are known up to second order in , as well as the resummations of leading and next - to - leading logarithms to all orders .",
    "the results presented in the following are mostly based on the study of ref .",

    "in addition , some preliminary results from the lep2 runs up to 189 gev have been employed .",
    "power corrections are supposed to have their origin in infrared divergences ( renormalons ) in the perturbative expansions when the overall energy scale @xmath2 approaches the landau pole @xmath8 .",
    "the first approaches were based on the assumption of the existence of a universal non - singular behaviour of an effective strong coupling at small scales , parametrized by a non - perturbative parameter @xmath9 with @xmath10 , which separates the perturbative from the non - perturbative region , @xmath11 gev , typically .",

    "an improved calculation @xcite for the jet broadening variable has shown that in this case the distribution is not only shifted , but also squeezed , since the shift is of the form @xmath35 .",
    "the perturbative distribution is obtained from a matching of the full next - to - leading order prediction to the resummation of all leading and next - to - leading logarithms @xmath36 .",
