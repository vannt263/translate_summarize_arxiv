    "in order to solve the problems such as singularity , nonrenormalizability , dark energy , and dark matter in general relativity , modified gravity theories have been presented and investigated . for recent reviews of modified gravities and related topics ,",
    "one of such modifications studied extensively is the palatini extension of the modified gravity . for the einstein - hilbert action ,",
    "the palatini theory is the same as the original metric theory .",
    "but if the action differs from the einstein - hilbert action , one usually gets a different gravity theory .",
    "palatini @xmath0 @xcite , eddington - inspired born - infeld ( eibi)@xcite , and born - infeld-@xmath0 @xcite gravities are known such theories .",
    "interestingly , it was found that the eibi gravity is identical to a bimetric gravity with an auxiliary field @xcite .",
    "these theories can be considered as adding auxiliary fields to the action , and attract much attention in recent years . besides , adding auxiliary fields is always helpful to construct lagrangian formalism of some theories .",
    "recently , pani , sotiriou , and vernieri suggested a new gravity theory that modifies general relativity by adding nondynamical auxiliary fields @xcite .",
    "this theory satisfies the weak equivalence principle and the corresponding modified einstein equations contain higher - order derivatives of the matter fields .",
    "although the details of the nature of the auxiliary fields and the way they enter to the action are unclear , this work provides a generic framework to study the phenomena and observational constrains of the gravity theory with auxiliary fields .",
    "this theory is determined by only two parameters up to the next to leading order in the derivative expansion @xcite . and",
    "in some approximations , eibi and palatini @xmath0 gravities correspond to the special cases of the theory . for gravity with tensor auxiliary fields ,",
    "see a subsequent note by ba@xmath1ados and cohen @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the extra dimension theory gives a new view of our universe , and opens a new way to solve the gauge hierarchy and cosmology problems .",
    "one of the famous models of this theory is the randall - sundrum ( rs ) braneworld model @xcite , which is considered in general relativity .",
    "it provides the theoretical predictions of extra dimension effects , which may be detected in future experiments and observations .",
    "along with the progress in the modified gravity and the braneworld models , there are many efforts to put to the braneworld model in modified gravities @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will apply the gravity theory with auxiliary fields to braneworld model and investigate the deformation and stability problems of the brane system .",
    "we wish this work will shed light on future studies of applying certain gravity theory with auxiliary fields to braneworld models .    for a thin brane model ,",
    "the energy - momentum tensor of the brane is a delta function of the extra dimension . in the original rs model ,",
    "the field equations are second order and hence the thickness of the brane can be neglected . however",
    ", if a gravity theory contains higher - order derivatives of matter fields , such as the gravity theory with auxiliary fields , it is very hard to solve the field equations for a thin brane model . on the other hand , the thick brane model , which can be used to study the inner structure of the brane , is a nature extension of the rs model @xcite .",
    "the brane configuration is usually generated by a smooth scalar field which connects two nontrivial vacua @xcite .",
    "so the energy momentum tensor of the matter field is a smooth function of the extra dimension and it is convenient to apply to the gravity theory with auxiliary fields .",
    "theoretically , the important problems in a braneworld model include the stability problem and the localization of the massless graviton on the brane , which are essential to recover the effective four - dimensional newtonian potential on the brane .",
    "experimentally , the interest mainly focuses on the phenomenology of braneworld models , such as the deviation from the newton potential caused by the massive kaluza - klein ( kk ) gravitons , and the high - energy particle scattering process involving kk particles .",
    "however , the spectrum of the gravity kk modes is determined by the brane configuration , which depends on the braneworld model . in this paper",
    ", we study the braneworld model in the new gravity theory with auxiliary fields .",
    "we find that domain wall solution is supported in this theory .",
    "the brane system is stable under the tensor perturbation , and the massless graviton is localized on the brane .",
    "furthermore , we also find some new phenomena that do not appear in general relativity .",
    "following ref .",

    "as the matter field equations are unchanged , it is hard to construct the lagrangian for the matter part .",
    "generally , the energy - momentum tensor @xmath5 for scalar fields contains second derivatives , so the most general form of @xmath4 up to fourth order in derivatives is @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 , and the possible terms containing the levi - civita tensor are not considered because they would violate parity .",
    "the requirement @xmath9 imposes some relations between the coefficients @xmath13 and @xmath14 , which will be determined by the perturbation method . using the following relations @xcite @xmath15b},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the lowest - order equations @xmath16 , the higher derivatives in @xmath9",

    "usually , if the einstein equations are second order ( the case of @xmath50 ) , one can achieve a topological nontrivial domain wall solution by introducing a superpotential @xcite , where the scalar field has a kink configuration and it connects the two degenerate vacua of the self - interaction potential @xmath51 @xcite , and the spacetime is asymptotically anti - de sitter ( ads ) at the boundary of the extra dimension .",
    "but it is hard to solve the above equations ( [ scalareom])-([implicit eq 2 ] ) for a given scalar potential @xmath51 or a given warp factor @xmath52 even numerically , because of the appearance of higher derivatives of @xmath28 and many nonlinear terms .",
