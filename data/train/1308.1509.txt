    "_ control theoretic splines _ are either interpolating or smoothing splines , depending on the constraints and cost function , with a constraint written as a system of linear differential equations  @xcite .",
    "the spline curve is obtained as the output of a given linear system .",
    "this concept is generalization of the smoothing spline by wahba  @xcite in that a richer class of smoothing curves can be obtained relative to polynomial curves .",
    "they have been proved to be useful in trajectory planning  @xcite , mobile robots  @xcite , contour modeling of images  @xcite , probability distribution estimation  @xcite , and so on . for more applications and a rather complete theory of control theoretic splines ,",
    "see the book  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , _ monotone _ control theoretic splines are also important in deriving a model or an estimation of a parameter such as the growing rate of an individual  @xcite .",
    "also , there have been a few applications of monotone smoothing in the statistical literature .",
    "the work of ramsay  @xcite and the discussion associated with the paper seems to be the first use .",
    "a more recent paper by kelly  @xcite is a nice application .",
    "monotonicity is achieved by adding a non - negative ( or non - positive ) derivative constraint on the output of the target linear system over a time interval .",
    "since the interval is an infinite subset of @xmath0 , this constraint becomes infinite - dimensional , which makes the problem difficult to solve . in  @xcite , this has been solved when the target linear system is a second - order integrator @xmath1 . however , for general cases , no solution has been obtained .",
    "more recently , the smoothing problem has been solved with inequality constraints  @xcite , in which inequality constraints are defined only on sampling points , and the constraints may be violated between sampling points .    in this paper , we propose a new method for constructing monotone splines guaranteeing the inequality constraint on a whole time interval , say @xmath2 $ ] , with more general linear systems . to solve this , we first formulate the problem as a semi - infinite quadratic programming problem  @xcite .",
    "then we adopt a discretization technique  @xcite to reduce the infinite - dimensional constraints to a finite dimensional constraints .",
    "this discretization is executed by partitioning the time interval into finitely many subintervals and estimating the constraint on a finite grid .",
    "the finite - dimensional quadratic programming problem can be solved with efficient algorithms  @xcite .",
    "we also discuss the limiting properties of the approximated solution .",
    "whereas the approximated solution is constrained on a finite grid , we show that it satisfies the original infinite - dimensional constraint provided the grid size is sufficiently small .",
    "we also prove that the approximated solution converges to the exact solution as the discretization grid - size tends to zero . by these properties",
    ", the proposed method can be safely adopted for monotone control theoretic splines .",
    "we also construct an illustrative example to show the effectiveness of our method .    the method proposed in this paper",
    "can be directly applied to model predictive control ( mpc ) , in particular nonuniformly - sampled - data mpc with continuous - time inequality constraints . for the study",
    ", there are many researches ; mpc with uniform sampling and piecewise constant control  @xcite , with constraints only on the sampling points  @xcite , and with nonuniformly sampling but unconstrained  @xcite . to our knowledge , there is no method for nonuniformly - sampled - data mpc with relatively general control inputs which guarantees continuous - time constraints as we will consider in this paper .",
