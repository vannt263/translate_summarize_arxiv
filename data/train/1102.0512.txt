    "to date more than 450 planetary candidates have been detected using the radial velocity ( rv ) technique . while most of the stars that host detected planets are main - sequence ( ms ) fgk stars ( m @xmath0 1.5 m@xmath1 ) , only a small fraction ( @xmath2 10@xmath3 ) are sub - giants or giants .",
    "however , evolved stars present an ideal case where to use the rv to search for planets around intermediate - mass stars ( m @xmath5 1.5m@xmath1 ) because their are cooler and rotate slower ( schrijver @xmath6 plos 1993 , a@xmath6a , 278 , 51 ) than their former ms progenitors and thus present more and narrower lines in their spectra . also",
    ", post - ms stars with b - v < 1.2 are quite stable and have a relatively low level of jitter ( less than 20 m / s ; hekker et al .  2006 , a@xmath6a 454 , 943 ) .",
    "to date @xmath250 planetary companions around post - ms stars with masses > 1.3 m@xmath1 have been detected and although the sample is limited , interesting results are emerging .",
    "firstly , there is a lack of close - in orbits companions ( with semi - major - axis @xmath00.6 au ) around giant stars .",
    "figure 1 shows the semi - major - axis distribution for planets orbiting stars more massive than 1.3m@xmath1 in the ms stage ( filled squares ) , the sub - giant phase ( filled triangles ) and the red giant branch ( rgb ; filled circles ) .",
    "as can be seen there is no planet orbiting giant stars closer than @xmath20.6 au .",
    "this observational result might suggests that planets in close - in orbits are destroyed during the evolution of the host stars through the rgb ( see e.g.  villaver & livio 2009 , apj , 705 , 81 ) .",
    "however , the semi - major - axis distribution of planets around subgiants suggests a different formation scenario around stars more massive than @xmath21.5m@xmath1 rather than a host star evolutionary effect , since the subgiants star have not expanded enough to destroy planets orbiting further than @xmath20.1 au ( johnson et al .",
    "2007 , apj , 665 , 785 ) .",
    "a second interesting result is that giant stars harbouring planets do not show a trend toward metal richness ( see e.g.  doellinger et al .",
    "2009 , a&a , 505 , 1311 ) , in direct contrast to what is observed in ms stars ( fischer & valenti 2005 , apj , 622 , 1102 ) , which might suggests that the disk instability formation mechanism could be the dominant mechanism by which gas giant planets are formed in massive disks ( boss 2000 , apj , 536 , 101 ) .",
    "however , this result could be also be explained as a pollution effect ( pasquini et al .",
    "2007 , a&a , 473 , 979 ) .",
    "finally , the fraction of giant stars harbouring giant planets is higher ( @xmath210@xmath3 ) compared to solar - type stars ( @xmath25@xmath3 ; doellinger et al .  2009 ) .",
    "this result suggests that giant planets are more efficiently formed in massive disks . clearly",
    "a larger census of planets around post - ms stars is required to probe and understand these interesting emerging trends .    .",
    "the squares , triangles and circles correspond to host stars in the ms , sub - giant phase and giant branch , respectively.,scaledwidth=81.0% ]    , 1.9m@xmath1 and 2.5m@xmath1 ( line pairs from top to bottom ) .",
    "the solid lines correspond to evolutionary tracks with [ fe / h]=0.0 and the dashed lines to [ fe / h]=0.2 . ,",
    "we are monitoring a sample of  150 bright giant stars ( most of them brighter than v=7.0 ) in the southern hemisphere taken from the hipparcos catalogue , according to their position in the hr diagram ( rgb and horizontal branch ( hb ) stars ) and precision in the parallax ( better than @xmath215% ) .",
    "we also removed from the sample stars in binary systems and those with photometric variability greater than 0.015 mag .",
    "figure 2 shows the position in the hr diagram for all of our targets ( filled red circles ) .",
    "also in figure 2 are overplotted evolutionary tracks from marigo et al .",
    "2008 ( a&a , 482 , 883 ) for stars with zams mass of 1.5m@xmath1 ( black lines ) , 1.9m@xmath1 ( blue lines ) and 2.5m@xmath1 ( green lines ) .",
    "the solid lines correspond to evolutionary tracks with [ fe / h]=0.0 and the dashed lines with [ fe / h]=0.2 .",
    "we are currently collecting data using the echelle spectrograph mounted on the 1.5 m telescope at ctio , which is equipped with an iodine ( i2 ) cell that can be used to obtain precise wavelength calibrations ( butler et al .",
    "1996 , pasp , 108 , 500 ) and therefore precise radial velocities .",
    "we are also using feros , mounted on the 2.2 m telescope at la silla observatory .",
    "so far we have taken @xmath210 spectra to each of our initial sample ( @xmath260 targets ) and @xmath22 - 6 spectra for the rest of the targets .",
    "we are developing a reduction pipeline ( in collaboration with d. fischer ; private communication ) for the data taken at ctio .",
    "we are using quartz lamps taken with the i2 cell in the light path , in order to compute the instrumental profile ( ip ) , which is necessary to do the deconvolution of the i2 spectrum from the observed stars spectra . finally , the radial velocities are computed using a cross - correlation between the observed spectra and a model template .",
    "we have derived atmospheric parameters ( effective temperature , surface gravity , microturbulence velocity and iron abundances ) for each of the targets in our sample , which are used to determine their masses and ages by fitting evolutionary tracks .",
    "these results will be published soon in a paper ."
