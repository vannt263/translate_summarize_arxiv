    "since the invention of the laser , optics has played an important role in nonlinear physics .",
    "one of the most known phenomena in nonlinear optics is the all - optical kerr effect or an intensity - dependent refractive index @xcite .",
    "while in the simplest limit the change in refractive index depends on the local intensity value , in nonlocal media the nonlinear perturbation depends also on the intensity in neighboring points .",
    "nonlocality strongly affects light propagation , leading to e.g. the stabilization of fundamental bright ( 2 + 1)d spatial solitons @xcite as well as higher - order and vector solitons @xcite , complex dynamics and long - range interactions of solitons @xcite and between solitons and boundaries @xcite .",
    "optical nonlocality also entails the observation of fundamental phenomena , from soliton bistability @xcite to spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite , from turbulence to condensation @xcite , from irreversibility and shock waves @xcite to gravity - like effects @xcite .",
    "+ in general , even in the absence of losses , self - trapped beams in nonlocal media undergoes variations in transverse size owing to a dynamic balance between self - focusing and diffractive spreading @xcite .",
    "such behavior resembles the collective excitation phenomena in condensed matter , e.g. the collective modes in bose - einstein condensates where the center of mass or the condensate size in a harmonic trap undergo oscillations @xcite . in optics , if the index well associated with the nonlinear response depends only on input power , nonlinear beam propagation can be described by a linear quantum harmonic oscillator and the breathing is purely periodic @xcite . in actual media",
    ", however , self - focusing also depends on the transverse profile of the beam @xcite .",
    "it was shown numerically that soliton breathing remains periodic in a ( 1 + 1)d simplified model , connecting this result with the existence of a ( quasi ) parabolic potential well @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper we generalize the ehrenfest theorem in order to find a set of ordinary differential equations ruling the evolution of a wave satisfying the schrdinger equation . we demonstrate that , if the wave is subject to a parabolic potential , a single equation for the beam width can be derived .",
    "we then apply our new equation to the investigation of spatial optical solitons in highly nonlocal media . in such a limit , as first demonstrated by snyder and mitchell @xcite and later confirmed experimentally in nematic liquid crystals @xcite and thermo - optic media @xcite , the light - induced waveguide can be satisfactorily approximated with a parabola , allowing the usage of all the mathematical tools developed for the quantum harmonic oscillator @xcite .",
    "this important result led to the coinage of the term accessible solitons @xcite .",
    "the original model for accessible solitons predicts a breathing period depending only on the input power .",
    "here we demonstrate that -in real media showing a non - differentiable response function- both extrema and period of the oscillations strongly depend on the input beam width .",
    "numerical simulations with reference to a nonlinear response modeled by a poisson equation , the latter modelling both nematic liquid crystals and thermo - optic materials @xcite , support our findings .",
    "in the scalar approximation , in the harmonic regime and for small nonlinear perturbations , the paraxial propagation of an optical wavepacket @xmath0 along @xmath1 is governed by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the vacuum wave - number and @xmath4 the refractive index of the unperturbed medium . due to its formal equivalence to the schrdinger equation @xcite , ( [ eq : nlse ] )",

    "momentum operator @xmath15 leads to the ehrenfest s theorem @xcite @xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the ehrenfest theorem has been successfully applied in optics to derive the trajectory of finite - size beams @xcite and the interaction of multiple filaments @xcite . here",
    "we aim to extend it and derive an ode governing the beam width , the latter related with the operator @xmath19 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : heisenberg ] ) yields @xmath20 the latter providing @xmath21 after a derivative with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "similarly , taking @xmath22 we find @xmath23 and @xmath24    the advantage of the heisenberg picture is that the generic _ bra _ @xmath25 and _ ket _ @xmath26 are stationary @xcite ( invariant with @xmath1 in optics ) , thus all the equations dealing with operators hold valid for the average values @xmath27 , as well . for conciseness ,",
    "hereafter we will omit the subscript @xmath0 when referring to average quantities related with the wave @xmath0 .",
    "the beam trajectory obeys the ehrenfest theorem , whereas the beam width can be obtained from two ( generally vectorial ) second - order odes in two unknowns : the width @xmath28 of its transverse profile and the width of its fourier transform @xmath29 .",
    "the solution is not straightforward , as a complete knowledge of the profile @xmath30 is needed to calculate the average refractive index well and its derivative .",
    "stated otherwise , all momenta of @xmath0 - i.e. , @xmath31 with @xmath32 - are required to get the second momentum evolution with @xmath1 . a substantial simplification applies when the index well is parabolic , that is , @xmath33 . in this case",

    "equation ( [ eq : width_parabolic ] ) is valid whenever the refractive index well is parabolic , in both linear ( @xmath49 independent of excitation ) and nonlinear ( @xmath49 depending on wavepacket profile and amplitude ) regimes @xcite . in the highly nonlocal limit",
    "the light - induced index well is much wider than the beam @xcite ; the photonic potential can be taylor - expanded to the second - order and equation ( [ eq : width_parabolic ] ) accurately models light propagation .",
    "we solve it in kerr media ( refractive index dependent on intensity @xmath50 with @xmath51 the vacuum impedance ) with reference to two common responses : gaussian @xcite and diffusive - like @xcite .",
    "the two responses differ for the green function @xmath52 linking the beam intensity @xmath53 to the nonlinear perturbation @xmath54 , with @xmath55 .",
    "hereafter , for the sake of simplicity we refer to either ( 2 + 1)d structures with cylindrical symmetry or ( 1 + 1)d geometries .",
    "when the green function @xmath52 is twice differentiable in the origin , it is easy to obtain @xmath56 , with coefficients @xmath57 where @xmath58 is computed in the origin .",

    "the term @xmath60 is @xmath61-independent , but it varies along @xmath1 through the local beam width @xmath62 , yielding an overall power - dependent phase shift of the beam @xcite .",

    "noteworthy , now it is @xmath118 , i.e. , the normalized input power @xmath93 had to be doubled with respect to the theoretical value ( [ eq : a_poisson ] ) because the intensity profile overlaps with higher polynomial terms of the self - induced potential @xcite .",

    "the discrepancy can be ascribed to two main causes : i ) the effective shape of the self - induced index well is not perfectly parabolic , as discussed above ; ii ) the beam shape strongly departs from gaussian due to the nonlinear interaction between a large number of modes , in turn breaking the validity of equation ( [ eq : a_poisson ] ) , the relationship between @xmath110 and @xmath104 now requiring a more involved approach .",
    "the general trends with @xmath68 can be confirmed by computing light propagation over longer distances .",
    "the results in figure [ fig : poisson_summary](c ) show soliton breathing over a propagation length of 5 mm .",
    "first , the evolution smoothly changes with @xmath68 , ruling out the presence of chaotic dynamics @xcite .",
    "second , the yellow portions in figure [ fig : poisson_summary](c ) ( bottom and top ) correspond to strongly aperiodic dynamics . between them , in the center of the panel , the dynamics is quasi - periodic with a comb - like structure : each tooth is tilted towards the left ( smaller @xmath1 ) , showing that the oscillation period changes and tends to a minimum when @xmath108 . consistently with theory , the oscillation amplitude is proportional to @xmath124 . in addition , the oscillation amplitude unexpectedly drops with @xmath1 due to an effective dissipation ( in the framework of the effective potential defined via equation ( [ eq : potential ] ) ) arising from the nonlinear interaction between the modes of the structure , as modeled by the higher - order polynomial terms in the light induced index well .",
    "next we study beam breathing in the frequency domain . to carry out this analysis we use a wavelet transform , as the evolution is not periodic and extends over a finite domain .",
    "wavelets allow to address the temporal fluctuations in the spectrum of a signal .",
    "such goal is achieved by using a basis composed by functions localized both in time and frequency .",
    "the family of wavelets is found by shifting and stretching a given function , named the mother wavelet .",
    "local components of the spectrum are found compressing / dilating the mother wavelet , the compression factor used to determine at which scale we are analyzing the signal .",
    "here we choose the wavelet transform daubechies db6 @xcite .",
    "to avoid artifacts due to the boundaries , we limit our analysis in the interval 1 mm@xmath127 mm . for",
    "both @xmath120 m ( figure [ fig : poisson_summary](d ) ) and @xmath128 m ( figure [ fig : poisson_summary](e ) ) the peak of the wavelet transform does not move on the frequency axis with @xmath1 .",
    "the wavelet transform is also strongly localized on the scale axis , demonstrating that no diffusion effects occur in the frequency domain .",
    "the absolute value of the transform decreases with @xmath1 , in line with the emerging dissipative mechanism described above .",
    "comparing the two cases , it is evident that the spectral components are higher when @xmath128 m due to larger oscillation amplitude .",
    "noteworthy , for @xmath120 m the higher frequency components are much more relevant than for @xmath128 m .",
    "in fact , in the former case the oscillation around the average value is heavily affected by the non - gaussian profile of the soliton @xcite , a contribution neglected in deriving equations ( [ eq : newton ] ) and ( [ eq : potential ] ) .",
    "this is evident in figure [ fig :",
    "poisson_summary](f ) showing the average period in the range 1 mm @xmath129 mm , computed from the wavelet transform .",
    "the shape is very close to figure  [ fig : poisson_summary](b ) , except near @xmath108 where a spurious peak appears .",
    "physically , close to the input the action of the higher - order modes can be neglected ; for long distances their effect accumulates and can not be neglected anymore .",
    "in conclusion , using tools from quantum mechanics we derived a general equation ruling the nonlinear evolution of the beam width in a parabolic index well . applying this model to light propagation in highly nonlocal media",
    ", we investigated how soliton breathing departs ( both qualitatively and quantitatively ) from the ideal snyder - mitchell law in real materials .",
    "in particular , we showed that the beam width dynamics can be modeled as a classic particle subject to a potential which depends on the width of the input beam .",
    "thus , although the beam itself introduces a longitudinal change in the index well @xcite , remarkably no aperiodic or chaotic evolution @xcite takes place within the validity of our model .",
    "numerical simulations verify that the breathing period depends on the width of the input beam and confirm the absence of chaos .",
    "moreover , the simulations indicate the emergence of novel and intriguing effects due to the nonlinear interaction of several modes , assessing the suitability of nonlocal nonlinear optics for the investigation of many - body physics @xcite .",
