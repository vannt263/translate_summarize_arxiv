    "the result then follows by induction .",
    "can the characterization of the extremal families in theorem [ mainthm ] be strengthened to @xmath232 rather than @xmath233 and @xmath234 , for @xmath117 ( using the notation of theorem [ mainthm ] ) ?",
    "for @xmath5 or @xmath4 this is trivially true , while for @xmath235 this can still be verified easily .",

    "hence if @xmath10 is a maximal intersecting family in @xmath6^{(4)}$ ] containing @xmath242 then the family @xmath74 given by theorem [ mainthm ] must be @xmath244 .",
    "so in this case we not only have @xmath245 but also @xmath246 , since @xmath247\\neq [ 8]=\\a\\la 1\\ra$ ] .    another obvious question to ask is when can we actually evaluate the expression given in theorem [ mainthm ] for particular values of @xmath248 and @xmath1 ?",
    "as we remarked earlier , @xmath33 is only known for @xmath48 .",
    "so we can evaluate @xmath164 and hence @xmath249^{(k)}:a\\cap [ \\alp]\\neq \\emptyset\\}|\\ ] ] for @xmath250 .",
    "for other values of @xmath3 and @xmath0 we can use theorem [ tuzathm ] to give bounds .",
    "finally we turn to the question of how large @xmath1 must be for the value of @xmath53 to be determined by theorem [ mainthm ] . in order to use construction [ example ] to give a lower bound for @xmath53 we require @xmath67 and so theorem [ tuzathm ] implies we need@xmath251    conversely , examining the proof of lemma [ conlem ] our argument requires @xmath252 where @xmath253 , for the upper bound to be valid .",
    "so , since @xmath254 , a rough calculation shows that theorem [ mainthm ] determines @xmath53 for @xmath255 .",
    "theorem [ tuzathm ] then implies that @xmath53 is determined for @xmath256    clearly this could be improved , indeed it is plausible that construction [ example ] is best possible whenever it exists .",
