    "the approach of the `` non - perturbative renormalization group '' ( nprg ) based on wilson s idea allows us to analyze dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( d@xmath0sb ) in qcd with systematic approximations compared to the ladder schwinger - dyson analysis which suffers from the strong gauge dependence .",
    "the nprg approach has been formulated as several forms of the functional differential equation , so people often call these formulations the `` functional renormalization group '' . among them , we adopt the flow equation derived by wetterich @xcite .    in nprg ,",
    "the 4-fermi coupling constant dynamically generated by the gauge interaction blows up at an infrared scale as a signal of d@xmath0sb .",
    "due to its explosive behavior , the access to the broken symmetry scale below the critical scale is a nontrivial problem . in the earlier studies , the auxiliary field ( bosonization)@xcite , the dynamical bosonization@xcite , and the explicit breaking term such as the bare mass term @xcite",
    "have been introduced to access the broken symmetry scale . however , using the weak solution method , we can directly access the broken symmetry scale only with the multi - fermi interactions but without any help by those methods .",
    "in order to study the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in qcd with three - flavor massless quarks , we define the following truncated effective action : @xmath1=&\\int_x \\bigg\\ {   \\frac{z_a}{4}f^a_{\\mu\\nu}f_a^{\\mu\\nu }   + \\frac{1}{2\\xi } \\left(\\partial_\\mu a_\\mu \\right)^2   + \\bar{\\psi}\\left(z_\\psi { { \\ooalign{\\hfil/\\hfil\\crcr$\\partial$}}}+i g_s{{\\ooalign{\\hfil/\\hfil\\crcr$a$}}}\\right)\\psi   -v(\\psi,\\bar{\\psi};\\lambda )   \\bigg\\},\\label{eq - app_eff_action } \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we use the covariant gauge with the gauge - fixing parameter @xmath2 , and do not represent the ghost sector for simplicity . in this definition , the multi - fermi interactions are represented by @xmath3 , which we call the fermion potential .",
    "we substitute the effective action ( [ eq - app_eff_action ] ) into the wetterich flow equation , and expand it in terms of the fields and the derivatives , so that we can obtain the coupled non - perturbative rg equations of these coupling constants .",
    "then , lowering the cutoff scale @xmath4 by solving the rg equations , the gauge interaction dynamically induces multi - fermi interactions . among them",
    ", the scalar 4-fermi interaction brings about the d@xmath0sb at an intermediate cutoff scale as the nambu  jona - lasinio model does .",
    "the 4-fermi coupling constant blows up at a finite infrared scale @xmath5 , showing the signal of the d@xmath0sb , and consequently its rg flow can not go beyond the critical scale @xmath5 .",
    "to go beyond the critical scale @xmath5 , we solve the flow equation without expanding the fermion potential with respect to the scalar fermion - bilinear field @xmath6 that is the central operator for d@xmath0sb . for simplicity ,",
    "the arguments of the fermion potential are limited to the scalar operator : @xmath7 . besides",
    ", the interactions are limited to the ladder type ones , and consequently we obtain the ladder flow equation as the following partial differential equation ( pde)@xcite : @xmath8,\\label{eq - ladder - flow - equation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the second casimir invariant of @xmath10 . here the dimensionless scale parameter @xmath11 and the anomalous dimension of the quark field @xmath12 are introduced",
    ". the pde ( [ eq - ladder - flow - equation ] ) can be numerically solved by replacing the derivatives with the finite differences .",
    "practically , we work with the pde for the first derivative of the fermion potential , @xmath13 , which we call the mass function . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - m - func_vs_sig ] , the numerical solution of the mass function at @xmath14 has a finite jump below the critical scale @xmath5 .",
    "this is nothing but the signal of d@xmath0sb , and the infrared value of the mass function at the limit , @xmath15 , is nothing but the dynamical mass @xmath16    .,width=336 ]",
    "while the singular behavior have numerically been evaluated , the non - analytic solution can not be mathematically authorized as a solution of the pde .",
    "such a solution can be defined as the `` weak solution '' which satisfies the integral form of the pde@xcite . here",
    "we skip the detail of its definition , but briefly introduce the method of the characteristic curve to evaluate the weak solution .    representing the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq - ladder - flow - equation ] ) as a function @xmath17 , the pde for the mass function can be written by @xmath18 where we use the notations , @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "now let us consider the mass function on a characteristic curve , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the initial position of @xmath23 .",
    "if @xmath24 obeys the following differential equation , @xmath25 then the derivative @xmath26 vanishes in the pde : @xmath27 eqs .",
    "( [ 095929_28mar13 ] ) and ( [ 095938_28mar13 ] ) are coupled ordinary differential equations equivalent to the pde ( [ eq - pde_mass_func ] ) .",
    "the parametric curve of the mass function @xmath28 in terms of @xmath22 can be constructed by solving them for each @xmath22 as shown in fig .",
    "[ aba : fig1 ] . below the critical scale @xmath5 ,",
    "the parametric curve is no longer regarded as the one - to - one mass function of @xmath29 .",
    "however , a condition of the weak solution called by `` rankine - hugoniot condition '' uniquely gives the one - to - one function shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - m - func_vs_sig]@xcite .     in terms of @xmath22.,width=480 ]",
    "finally we show the result of the non - ladder extended flow equation , where the non - ladder corrections are added to the ladder flow equation ( [ eq - ladder - flow - equation])@xcite . in this approximation ,",
    "the commutator of the generator of @xmath30 is ignored consistently for obtaining the gauge independent result @xcite .",
    "the gauge dependence of the chiral condensates @xmath31 , which is actually obtained by introducing the bare mass term of quarks as its source term , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - dependence_chi ] .",
    "the gauge dependence of the non - ladder extended results is greatly suppressed compared with the ladder results .",
    "therefore we conclude that our non - ladder extended flow equation well respects the gauge independence . here",
    "it should be noted that , in the landau gauge ( @xmath32 ) , the gauge - dependent ladder result of the chiral condensates coincides with the almost gauge - independent non - ladder extended one .",
    "this feature of the landau gauge proves a folklore that the ladder approximation looks good particularly in the landau gauge ."
