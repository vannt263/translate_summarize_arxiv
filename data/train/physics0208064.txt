    ". the lengthscale peculiarities , even when being experimentally established , do not often lead to a clear physical understanding . in the case of the vft form",
    "the physical meaning of the experimentally determined vft temperature @xmath6 , is justified by its closeness to the _ thermodynamic _ kauzmann temperature @xmath23 . at this critical temperature ( @xmath24 ) the excess liquid - over - solid scl entropy , or configurational entropy ,",
    "this property is thought to be associated with the absolute thermodynamic instability of the thermally equilibrated states of the scls with respect to liquid - to - solid rearranging processes that extend from the ergodic region ( @xmath13 ) to lower temperatures .",
    "the theoretically motivated ergodic instability ( caused by divergence of the zero moment of the relevant relaxation - time distribution function@xcite ) establishes the thermodynamic - dynamic ( td - d ) correspondence equation , @xmath25 .",
    "this equation was experimentally justified by angell@xcite within a certain range of experimental scatter which often lies@xcite inside the error of experimentally measured characteristic temperatures .",
    "thermodynamic models for scls are commonly tested by the @xmath26 fitting analysis .",
    "the vft form has proved to be ineffective for establishing simultaneously all three adjustable parameters ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath6 ) within the overall fitting analysis of the observed scl viscosity ( see discussion in ref . ) .",
    "an improved analysis for the tested forms was proposed in refs.@xcite on the basis of fitting experimental data @xmath10and additionally their first - order ( @xmath29 ) and second - order ( @xmath30 ) derivatives .",
    "these temperature - derivative analyses permit one to exclude the unknown fitting parameters , step - by - step , by making the three - parameter fitting procedure self - consistent . as a result ,",
    "the validity of the vft form , when tested within the whole ergodic relaxation range , was questioned@xcite for all scls investigated above the so - called @xmath19-@xmath31-relaxation bifurcation temperature @xmath32 .",
    "notably , this crossover temperature was often found close to other known _ crossover temperatures _",
    "@xmath33 and @xmath1 introduced , respectively , as a scaling temperature by rssler and co - workers@xcite and as the dynamic critical temperature of the mode coupling theory ( mct ) . within these studies",

    "the data for moderately scl ( or _ weak - scl _ ) states in all glass forming liquids that have been studied are in a good quantitative agreement with the modified vft form given as the _ high - t _ vft ( ht - vft ) version in the old canonical vft form but with new adjustable parameters , including the ht - vft characteristic temperature @xmath37(@xmath38 , see table ii in ref . ) .",
    "this fundamental finding is exemplified by the case of the simple molecular liquid propylene carbonate ( pc ) in fig.1 .",
    "as seen from the analysis given in fig.1 , the validity of the canonical vft form is limited by the temperature domain @xmath36 , corresponding to the strongly scl states , characterized by relaxation times @xmath39 , or by viscosities @xmath40 .    another interesting description of the sl states is also provided by analysis of the thermodynamic ( heat capacity ) data that was elucidated by richert and angell@xcite on the basis of the _ configurational entropy _ @xmath41 data .",

    "careful complex dynamic - thermodynamic analyses enabled one to establish a physical meaning for the standard vft fitting form , that was justified in terms of the thermodynamic adam - gibbs model ( agm ) introduced in ref .. the vft form is therefore treated as the _ vft equation _ that provides a good description of the observed dynamic and thermodynamic relaxation of the _ strong - scl _ states ( see ag - line in fig.2 ) . within the context of percolation theory@xcite",
    ", @xmath6 may be associated with the critical temperature where the correlation length of the strong - scl states diverges in accordance with the thermodynamic instability at the kauzmann temperature t@xmath42 .",
    "a microscopic version of this kind of instability was given by bender and shlesinger ref . by invoking a defect - aggregation mechanism that was recently justified @xcite for pc by the pressure - dependent experiments .",
    "in reality , strong - scl ergodic states do not survive below @xmath0 ( see solid squares in fig.2 ) . as shown in ref .",
    ", this is due to the ergodic - to - nonergodic crossover from the short - range strong liquid correlations , characteristic of solids , to somewhat long - range weak liquid correlations , characteristic of gases .",
    "conversely , no physical justification was given for the ht - vft form introduced in refs.@xcite .",
    "the main aim of the current study is to provide a physical description of the weak - scl states on the basis of both the extended thermodynamic agm and the dynamic vft equations .",
    "the old idea that anomalous temporal ( non - debye ) and anomalous temperature ( non - arrhenius ) behaviors related to the scl relaxation , may be attributed to rearranging regions@xcite , or domains@xcite , or droplets@xcite or clusters@xcite of different size and structure , is still widely explored and remains fruitful .",
    "there is today considerable direct evidence for the existence of these kinds of regions .",
    "they have been observed on a microscopic scale by multidimensional nmr , photobleaching , excess light scattering and dielectric hole burning , as reviewed in ref . , and by x - ray scattering data , discussed in ref .. the percolation theory , improved by mesoscopic - domain energy - size scaling , as shown by chamberlin in ref .",

    "furthermore , exploration of stauffer s cluster - size scaling form , based on the percolation theory , made it possible@xcite to justify the underlying ergodic - nonergodic transition that emerges at the ergodic crossover temperature @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) , where the cluster - size gaussian distribution of the strong - scl states is transformed upon cooling into the poisson form ( see also discussions in refs.@xcite ) .    in the current study",
    "we extend the cluster approach to the problem of relaxation of ergodic states in scls .",
    "we will demonstrate that the structural heterogenous fluctuations , being small in the case of the strong - scl state , are responsible for moderately scl behavior as revealed in refs.@xcite by deviations from the standard vft fitting form .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we discuss phenomenological descriptions of the observed primary relaxation timescale in terms of the known fitting forms and macroscopic parameters commonly used by experimentalists . instead of the frequency observation windows , given by @xmath45 , which are distinct for different dynamic experiments , the timescale is introduced through the temperature domains for the scl excitations established with the help of the characteristic temperatures . in sec .",
    "iii we give the dynamic and thermodynamic description of scls based on the statistical approach to the rearranging regions introduced by adam and gibbs . by accounting for their size fluctuations ,",
    "we develop extended versions for the agm and the vft equations .",
    "the qualitative and quantitative analyses of the proposed physically justified fitting forms are given in sec .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "it was experimentally proved by richert and angell in ref . that the widely employed agm equation    @xmath46    and the phenomenological vft form given in the two equivalent forms , namely @xmath47 are self - consistent when subject to the conditions @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "these equations apparently work well in describing the strong - scl state relaxation in terms of the mct within the temperature domain @xmath36 .",
    "this domain was studied@xcite simultaneously on the basis of dynamic and thermodynamic experimental data , more precisely , through the primary relaxation timescale @xmath26 , deduced from the dielectric loss spectra , and the configurational entropy :    @xmath50    with the excess liquid - over - solid _ isobaric _ specific heat capacity @xmath51 .",
    "accounting for the fact that at high enough temperatures@xcite @xmath52 , the configurational entropy ( [ sc1 ] ) was given@xcite in explicit form , namely @xmath53 that establishes useful relations between the observed model parameters .",
    "it has been demonstrated@xcite that unlike the vft form , restricted by the strong - scl states , eq.([sc2 ] ) does a good job within the whole range of the thermally equilibrated states ( see solid line in fig.2 ) .",
    "the theoretical foundation of the experimental findings by richert and angell are not limited by the aforesaid td - d correspondence equation@xcite , i.e. , @xmath25 .",
    "one can see that the existence of the strongly scl states , based on the dynamic vft equation and the thermodynamic agm within observation windows , evidently requires in addition @xmath54 . here",
    "the characteristic temperature @xmath55 is introduced as a thermodynamic parameter derived from the maximum of @xmath56 , observed by the scanning calorimetry , and the corresponding laboratory glass - point @xmath57 that is deduced from the dynamic experiments and defined@xcite by the equation @xmath58 given at @xmath59 . unlike the case of the first td - d equation",
    ", there is no systematic study to verify the precision of the second equation . except for the case of scls ( see e.g. fig.2 in ref . ) there is even no accepted international convention on the definition of the thermodynamic value @xmath55 for the various glass forming materials .",
    "furthermore , eqs.([tau1-ag ] , [ taub - vft ] ) can not be extrapolated to high temperatures beyond their temperature domain .",
    "hence , the justification given in ref . for the vft and the adm corresponding macroscopic equations , i.e. , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , should be reconsidered .",
    "the same equations might be introduced by application of the _ ergodic hypothesis _ employed for scls in ref .. this means that the strongly scl states , that emerge above the crossover - ergodic - temperature @xmath43 ( see eq.(7 ) in ref . ) , can be introduced through certain observables estimated by thermodynamic and dynamic averages .",
    "physically , this corresponds to the fact that the thermally equilibrated states are equivalent to ergodic states observed in the dynamical experiments .",
    "if this is true , this requires new equations for the ergodic time scale and length scale given , respectively , by @xmath62 in other words , eq.([tau - and - z ] ) introduces the minimum magnitudes for temporal and size characteristics necessary employed for the mesoscopic description of the scl states .",
    "in contrast to the second - order thermodynamic transition approach , mct treats the liquid - to - glass structural transformation as a dynamic process driven by liquid density fluctuations . in the idealized version of mct [ 4 ]",
    "the ergodic - to - nonergodic transition occurs at a unique crossover temperature @xmath63 at which neutron spin scattering measurements signal the appearance of the glassy - like correlations given by the so - called non - ergodic parameter , which is analogues to the edwards - anderson spin - glass order parameter in the case of weak - scl states .",
    "moreover , the mct  predicts@xcite the algebraic - type scaling for the primary relaxation timescale , namely @xmath64 with the slowing - down exponent @xmath3 .",
    "this observable is rather sensitive to the location of @xmath1 as well to the temperature region of the fitting experimental curve@xcite .",
    "the temperature domain of eq.([tau - mct ] ) is much narrower than that for the case of the ht - vft form given@xcite by @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the arrhenius crossover temperature .",
    "a temperature @xmath67 is introduced in eq.([tau - mct ] ) to designate the lowest temperature point where the algebraic mct form fits experimental data ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "unlike the first estimates reported for the slowing - down exponents that exceeded magnitudes of @xmath68 in scls ( see table1 in ref . ) , the values established by the mct eq.([tau - mct ] ) in glass - forming materials are in the range , @xmath69 for liquids eq.([tau - mct ] ) , and @xmath70 for polymers . for macroscopic observable parameters of the timescale in glass forming molecular liquids and polymers see , respectively , cases a and b in table 1 .      one of the salient features of the primary relaxation is the so - called _ time - temperature _ superposition principle@xcite .",
    "its physical justification has not yet been established but it is employed effectively to scale the dielectric loss spectra@xcite .",
    "meanwhile , analyses of a number of the @xmath19-timescale characteristics near @xmath0 for several experimental studies of glass forming materials@xcite , have revealed a number of underlying _ temporal - spatial _ correlations in explicit form .",
    "the analysis was given@xcite in terms of the phenomenological relation , i.e. , @xmath71 expressed through the _",
    "fragility_@xcite @xmath72 that is related to the steepness index@xcite , and the kohlrausch - williams - watts ( kww ) stretched exponent@xcite @xmath73 .",
    "incorporation@xcite of the growth - correlation scaling law , employed in the order - disorder kinetic transition theory@xcite , into the relaxation function of the scls led to a description@xcite of the aforesaid temporal - spatial correlations for the dynamical exponents in a form @xmath74 @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a universal parameter ( because it is material - independent ) within a certain glass family .",
    "in addition , the equation for the growth - correlation dynamic exponent , i.e. , @xmath77 , was established in ref.[33](see also proposal by ngai in ref . ) .    within mct ,",
    "the characteristic temperatures , as well as the dynamical exponents , are treated as certain equilibrium thermodynamic parameters , which , as demonstrated in ref .",
    ", are not independent .",
    "this statement is exemplified by the widely employed equation@xcite    @xmath78    where @xmath79 is the universal parameter known as the _ lower fragility limit _ @xcite . as follows from eq.([tg / t0 ] ) , the uncertainty in the @xmath80 , caused@xcite by deviation of the inclination of the straight lines in fig.3 , is due to the uncertainty of the timescale unit parameter @xmath81 , given by eqs.([tau - and - z ] ) , and to that of the glass - transition characteristic time @xmath82 .",
    "eq.([tg / t0 ] ) was first introduced in refs.@xcite on the basis of the _ vft equation _ ( [ taud - vft ] ) , namely @xmath83 where the _ timescale auxillary function _",
    "@xmath84 is introduced .",
    "let us define the _ timescale _ _ steepness function _ by    @xmath85    with @xmath86 for the particular case of eq.([tau - vft - equation ] ) .",
    "eq.([mt - vft ] ) , estimated at @xmath87 , is known@xcite as the fragility @xmath72 that was proposed by angell for the strong - to - fragile classification of glass forming materials@xcite .",
    "we see that unlike the case of @xmath88 , the function @xmath89 has only two free parameters , @xmath6 and @xmath90 .",
    "moreover , the latter can be excluded from the two - equation system given by @xmath91and @xmath92 , using @xmath93 , that eventually results in the known eq.([tg / t0 ] ) .",
    "as shown above , eq.([tg / t0 ] ) is a formal consequence of the self - consistency between the vft equation @xmath91 and its first derivative given by the observed fragility @xmath92 .",
    "physically , the existence of eq.([tg / t0 ] ) is due to the presence of the strong - scl states at the lowest temperature @xmath0 parametrized by these equations .",
    "one can therefore introduce a similar relation ( see eq.8 in ref . ) , namely    @xmath94    associated with the weak - scl states at the lowest temperature @xmath1 .",
    "the validity of eq.([tc / t0 ] ) was established numerically with the universal parameter @xmath95 ( see fig . 2 in ref .",
    ") that corresponds to the adopted value @xmath96 .",
    "eq.([tc / t0 ] ) was deduced@xcite by application of the taylor series for the steepness function ( [ steep - func ] ) near @xmath0 and @xmath1 along with the following assumptions : ( i ) in contrast to the case of the timescale @xmath20 the steepness function @xmath2 is analytical and smooth beyond @xmath6 ; and ( ii ) similar to the strong - scl state , described by @xmath97 with parameters @xmath4 and @xmath6 , the weak - scl states can be described within the scope of the ht - vft form with help of @xmath98 , using @xmath99 , and @xmath100 , i.e. by the formal substitution of @xmath6 and @xmath0 in the standard vft equation by @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the ht - vft form , respectively .",
    "it is remarkable that the idea to introduce in ref .",
    "the steepness function @xmath2 on the basis of the ht - vft analytical form was stimulated by the uncertainty of the fitting analyses of @xmath10 discussed by kivelson et al .",
    "in ref .. experimentally , the ht - vft form was established by the first - order derivative analyses given by stickel et al . in refs.@xcite .",
    "the most striking consequence of the existence of the two distinct scl states described at @xmath0 ( in the vicinity but below @xmath1 ) , respectively , by eqs.([tg / t0 ] ) and ( [ tc / t0 ] ) is an inference on the self - consistency of the principal characteristic temperatures .",
    "indeed , excluding the fragility @xmath72 from eqs.([tg / t0 ] ) and ( [ tc / t0 ] ) one obtains the following _ characteristic - temperature equation _ ( cte ) , namely @xmath101 ( that was analyzed analytically in ref . under the model simplification @xmath102 ) .",
    "one can see that beyond the scope of this simplification , eq.([kok ] ) includes the particular case of the mct _ ideal _ liquid - to - glass transition that occurs at a unique crossover temperature given by the equation @xmath103 .",
    "we have shown that representation of the cte in the form given in eq.([kok ] ) is ensured by application of the vft fitting  forms to both the strong and the weak scl states . on the other hand , there exist a number of fitting forms ( see e.g. refs.@xcite and for a short review see ref . ) and therefore the question arises as to whether the fact of self - dependency of characteristic temperatures given through the cte is also limited by exploration of the vft forms .    using the lindeman melting criterion for the mean - square displacements of pre - transition solid - like clusters in scls , novikov et al . in ref . deduced the cte in the  square - root  form : @xmath104 .",
    "meanwhile it was shown@xcite that @xmath105 and the  cubic - root ",
    "cte , i.e. , @xmath106 @xmath107 , are respectively , the lower and the upper limits of the solutions of eq.([kok ] ) considered under the model constraint @xmath102 .",
    "physically , this means that the experimental data on @xmath108 and theoretical predictions for @xmath0 , deduced from eq.([kok ] ) under conditions @xmath109 and @xmath110 , are expected to satisfy the equation @xmath111 within the experimental error of @xmath112 ( see the last column in table 1 in ref . ) and , in addition , to satisfy the inequalities @xmath113 .",
    "odagaki proposed a controlled - diffusion approach to the scl glass - transition problem in ref .. a glass transformation process was characterized by the critical vft temperature @xmath6 ( @xmath114 ) and the crossover temperature @xmath1 ( @xmath115 ) related to the peculiarities of the pseudo - divergent @xmath19-timescale , and introduced@xcite through the true divergence of the first moment of their distribution function . as a consequence the cte in the form @xmath116 was deduced . taking into account that the excess entropy @xmath117 , given in eq.([sc1 ] ) , in real scls is well approximated by eq.([sc2 ] ) , we represent here the odagaki cte in the following equivalent form , namely @xmath118 again , one can see that the aforementioned mct ideal transition is also satisfied by eq.([oda ] ) .",
    "a comparative analysis of the distinct cte form is given in fig.4 for glass forming liquids ( case a ) and polymers ( case b ) .",
    "as seen from fig.4 the odagaki cte prediction ( [ oda ] ) is very close to that given by eq.([kok ] ) with a value for @xmath119 that lies within the experimentally established uncertainties , i.e. , @xmath120 and @xmath95 .",
