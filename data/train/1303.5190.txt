    "clustered sensor networks can be classified into two broad types ; homogeneous and heterogeneous sensor networks . in homogeneous networks",
    "all sensor nodes are identical in terms of energy and hardware complexity . with",
    "purely static clustering in a homogeneous network , it is evident that chs will be over - loaded with long range transmissions to the remote sink , and extra processing is necessary for protocol co - ordination and data aggregation .",
    "wsn faces a problem that chs dies before other nodes .",
    "however , to ensure that all nodes dies at about the same time when system expires , minor amount of residual energy is wasted .",
    "one method to ensure is rotating the role of a cluster head periodically and randomly over all the nodes .",
    "the downside of role rotation and using a homogeneous network is that all nodes should be capable of act as ch , therefore should require necessary hardware capabilities . on the other hand , in heterogeneous sensor network , two or more different types of sensor nodes in terms of different energy are used .",
    "the problem area is that extra energy and complex hardware can be embedded in few ch nodes , therefore reducing hardware cost of the entire sensor network .    in leach",
    "the sensor nodes are equipped with same amount of energy .",
    "this protocol selects ch periodically and consumes energy uniformaly .",
    "each node is decide itself whether or not a ch based on probability [ 1 ] .",
    "sep is based on two level heterogeneity and the ch election in sep is on the basis on weighted election probability .",
    "a fraction @xmath0 advanced nodes in total of @xmath1 nodes is provided with an additional energy factor @xmath2 .",
    "so , the stability period is increased due to advance nodes , however ch selection is done in the same way as in leach .",
    "esep is an extension of sep that considers three types of nodes in discussed in [ 2,3 ] . in [ 4 ] deec estimates ideal value of network life time is used to compute reference energy that each node expend during a round .    _",
    ", width=377,height=188 ]    in wsn , current scenario of research deals with efficient power utilization of sensor nodes . due to small battery power of these nodes ,",
    "there is a chance that wsn is not longer survive .",
    "smart utilization of sensor node is very crucial to prolong the life time and stability of wsn .",
    "most current protocols , such as sep and esep are stability - oriented protocols , minimize energy utilization of network by using clustering approach . stability period is the time interval before the death of first node in wsn . in clustering data",
    "is transmitted to sink in form of clusters and every cluster consists of a ch , responsible to transmit data at sink .",
    "existing protocol sep describe impact of heterogeneity on heterogeneous - aware protocols and instability of protocols , such as leach in presence of heterogeneity of sensor nodes .",
    "sep is based on weighted election probabilities assigned to each node to become ch according to their initial energy .",
    "the rotating epoch and election probability is directly correlated with initial energy of nodes instead of residual energy of the nodes .",
    "advance nodes more frequently becomes chs , it may happen after some rounds the energy of advance nodes becomes less than normal nodes . to overcome this drawback , we introduce a new ch selection scheme for sep based on ecr of each node . by using this criteria sep increases stability and lifetime of network .",
    "sep improves the stable region of a wsn by using the heterogeneity parameters such as fraction of advanced nodes @xmath3 and additional energy factor @xmath4 between the normal and advance nodes . to prolong the stability region of a network ,",

    "+ b. each advanced node becomes a ch @xmath19 times every @xmath18 rounds per epoch .",
    "+ c. average number of ch per round per epoch is equal to @xmath13 . + if at the end of each epoch the number of times that an advanced node becomes ch is exactly not equal to @xmath20 times , so energy is not well distributed and average numbers of ch per epoch per round is not equal to @xmath13 .",
    "in ecrsep , ch selection is based on the energy consumptio rate ( ecr ) .",
    "ecr is defined mathematically as : @xmath23 .",
    "+ where , @xmath24 is initial energy and @xmath25 , is residual energy of each node and @xmath26 is current round . in next round , ch selection",

    "a node , which have less ecr in the previous round is selected ch in next round .",
    "a ch in the previous round is not selected as ch in the next round , because its ecr is very high as compare to non ch nodes .      in radio model ,",
    "energy dissipates @xmath27 to run receiver and transmitter circuitry and @xmath28 for transmitter amplifier .",
    "the equations that is used to calculate the receiving cost and transmitting cost for @xmath29 bit message and distance @xmath30 is modeled in [ 4 ] is as shown in below : + transmitter energy @xmath31",
    "@xmath32    receiving energy @xmath33 @xmath34      in this section , we discuss network model for ecrsep .",

    "the network is deployed into clustering hierarchy .",
    "every cluster has a ch , responsible to directly transmit data to sink .",
    "we suppose that our network is stationary .",
    "+ in our network we considered two level of heterogeneity in terms of energy . in heterogeneous networks , there are two types of sensor nodes , i.e. , normal nodes and advance nodes . @xmath37 is initial energy of normal nodes and @xmath0 is fraction of advanced nodes .",
    "advanced nodes have @xmath38 times more energy than normal nodes .",
    "so @xmath39 advanced nodes having initial energy @xmath40 and @xmath41 normal nodes having initial energy @xmath42 .",
    "the initial energy @xmath43 of two levels heterogeneous network is given in [ 2 ] as : @xmath44 so , two level heterogeneous network have @xmath45 times more energy than homogeneous network .      in this section ,",
    "we describe the ch selection method in ecrsep protocol . in this protocol ch selection",
    "is based on energy consumption rate .",
    "let @xmath46 is the number of rounds to become ch for nodes @xmath47 that are participating to become ch .",
    "we refer to it as rotating epoch .",
    "let @xmath48 is average probability to become ch during @xmath46 rounds .",
    "when nodes have same amount of energy at each epoch , choosing the @xmath49 to become @xmath50 ensures that in every round there are @xmath51 cluster - heads , we have @xmath52 the total number of chs per epoch is equal to : @xmath53    in two level heterogeneous networks , @xmath54 is replaced by weighted probabilities for advance and normal nodes as modeled in [ 4 ] as : @xmath55 @xmath56 therefore,@xmath57 is changed into :    @xmath58    we can get probability threshold used to elect ch .",
    "thus the threshold is correlated with energy consumption rate of each node directly .",
    "we evaluate performance of our protocol by using matlab .",
    "we arrange a wsn with @xmath59 nodes are distributed randomly in @xmath60 field .",
    "we assume in our simulations that sink is at center of sensing region . to compare performance of ecrsep with other protocols , effect of interference and signal collision",
    "is not considered in wireless channel .",
    "our goal is to compare performance of ecrsep with sep , esep , leach , and deec protocol on basis of energy dissipation and the longevity of network .",

    "it is observed that , ecrsep has enhanced stability period than all other protocol and network life for ecrsep was increased as compared to others .",
    "however deec outperforms all protocols in terms of throughput .",

    "is done on probability if leach would be considered with homogeneity then there would be a large difference .",
    "esep with tree levels of heterogeneity and probability based protocol obviously shows better results than sep and leach . due to availability of more nodes with extra energy esep results in increased stability period than sep and leach",
    "the first node of our proposed protocol die after 5000 rounds , achieves greater stability as compared to all protocols discussed in this paper .",
    "2 ( a ) shows that the network life of leach is less as compared to all protocols , as it is very sensitive to heterogeneity .",
    "results shows that ecrsep achieves maximum network lifetime .",

    "all the nodes die after 23000 rounds in our proposed protocol .",
    "the network life of other protocols is not more than 8000 rounds .",
    "our protocol beats all these protocols , discussed in this paper .",
    "2 ( e ) shows that nodes die more slowly in ecrsep , which means that its stability period is increased .",
