    "the polarization properties of quantum fields have received much attention over the past few years , especially in the single photon regime .",
    "the polarization state is a robust characteristic , which is relatively simple to manipulate without inducing more than marginal losses .",
    "it is thus hardly surprising that many outstanding experiments in quantum optics , such as bell tests  @xcite , quantum tomography  @xcite or quantum cryptography  @xcite , have been performed using polarization states .",
    "the polarization of a light beam in classical optics can be elegantly visualized by resorting to the poincar sphere , and is determined by the four stokes parameters  @xcite .",
    "these parameters present unique advantages : they are easily measured , they can be extended to the quantum domain , where the stokes parameters become the mean values of the stokes operators , and , finally , they allow us to classify the states of light according to a degree of polarization  @xcite .",
    "this classical degree of polarization is simply the modulus of the stokes vector .",
    "while this affords a very intuitive image , it has also serious drawbacks that can be traced back to the fact that the stokes parameters are proportional to the second - order correlations of the field amplitudes .",
    "this may be sufficient for most classical problems , but for quantum fields higher - order correlations are crucial . for this reason , the stokes parameters do not distinguish between quantum states having remarkably different polarization properties  @xcite .",
    "for example , the classical polarization degree of the state with exactly one photon in each of the horizontally and vertically polarization modes is zero , but it can not be regarded as unpolarized .",
    "these unwanted consequences call for alternative measures .",
    "recently , luis  @xcite has brought in a challenging idea to circumvent these difficulties .",
    "for the full characterization of polarization , a probability distribution ( obtained via the @xmath0 function ) is defined on the poincar sphere . to some extent ,",
    "the existence of such a probabilistic description is unavoidable in quantum optics from the very beginning , since the stokes operators do not commute and thus no state can have a definite value of all of them simultaneously ( except the vacuum ) . in this framework",
    ", the degree of polarization of a field state can be defined as the distance from its associated distribution to the uniform distribution corresponding to unpolarized light .",
    "we find this proposal interesting , but semiclassical in nature .",
    "in addition , we stress that the su(2 ) @xmath0 function does not connect manifolds with different photon excitations , so the information it embodies can not be , in general , complete .",
    "the question of what unpolarized light is has a relatively long history  @xcite .",
    "today , there is a wide consensus  @xcite in considering unpolarized light as the light that is described by quantum states that are invariant with respect to any su(2 ) polarization transformation .",
    "it turns out that this requirement fixes the density operators admissible to represent unpolarized fields .",
    "it is then suggestive to look at the degree of polarization as a distance from a given state to this set of unpolarized states .",
    "the notion of distance measure has been successfully used in assessing nonclassicality  @xcite , entanglement  @xcite , quantum information  @xcite and localization  @xcite , to cite only some relevant examples .",
    "these measures are useful both when comparing experiments with the corresponding theory and in comparing different experiments .",
    "we hope that they will be soon agreed upon by experimentalists and theorists alike .    in this paper",
    ", we connect the idea of distance with the problem of assessing the polarization characteristics of a quantum field , exploring a suitable definition that avoids at least some of the aforementioned difficulties that previous approaches based on stokes parameters encounter .",
    "we assume a monochromatic plane wave propagating in the @xmath1 direction , whose electric field lies in the @xmath2 plane . under these conditions",
    ", we are dealing with a two - mode field that can be fully described by two complex amplitude operators .",
    "they are denoted by @xmath3 and @xmath4 , where the subscripts @xmath5 and @xmath6 indicate horizontally and vertically polarized modes , respectively .",
    "the commutation relations of these operators are standard : @xmath7 = \\delta_{jk } \\ , , \\qquad j , k \\in \\{h , v \\ } \\ , .\\ ] ] the stokes operators are then defined as the quantum counterparts of the classical variables , namely  @xcite @xmath8 and their mean values are precisely the stokes parameters @xmath9 , where @xmath10 .",
    "using the relation ( [ bccr ] ) , one immediately gets that the stokes operators satisfy the commutation relations of angular momentum : @xmath11 = 0 \\ , , \\qquad [ \\hat{s}_1 , \\hat{s}_2 ] = 2 i \\hat{s}_3 \\ , , \\ ] ] and cyclic permutations .",
    "the noncommutability of these operators precludes the simultaneous exact measurement of their physical quantities . among other consequences",
    ", this implies that no field state ( leaving aside the two - mode vacuum ) can have definite nonfluctuating values of all the stokes operators simultaneously .",
    "this is expressed by the uncertainty relation @xmath12 contrary to what happens in classical optics , the electric vector of a monochromatic quantum field never describes a definite ellipse  @xcite .    in mathematical terms , a su(2 ) ( or linear ) polarization transformation is any transformation generated by the operators @xmath13 .",
    "it is well known  @xcite that the operator @xmath14 is the infinitesimal generator of geometrical rotations around the direction of propagation , whereas @xmath15 is the infinitesimal generator of differential phase shifts between the modes . as indicated by eq .",
    "( [ crsu2 ] ) , these two operators suffice to generate all su(2 ) polarization transformations , which in experimental terms means that they can be accomplished with a combination of phase plates and rotators ( that produce rotations of the electric field components around the propagation axis )  @xcite .",
    "the standard definition of the degree of polarization is  @xcite @xmath16 where the subscript sc indicates that this is a semiclassical definition , mimicking the form of the classical one . in the semiclassical description",
    "it is implicitly assumed that unpolarized light ( i.  e. , the origin of the poincar sphere ) is defined by the specific values  @xcite @xmath17 sometimes the extra requirement that the stokes parameters are temporally invariant is added to make the definition even more stringent  @xcite . in any case , this conception has several flaws that have been put forward before and give rise to strange concepts such as that of quantum states with  hidden \" polarization  @xcite .",
    "actually , this notion leads to the paradoxical conclusion that unpolarized light has a polarization structure , which is latent when the mean intensities are measured and detectable when the noise intensities are measured  @xcite .    if , as anticipated in the introduction , one looks at unpolarized light as field states that remain invariant under any su(2 ) polarization transformation , then there is no more any  hidden \" polarization .",
    "any state satisfying this invariance condition will also fulfill the classical definition of an unpolarized state , but the converse is not true .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that the density operator of such  quantum \" unpolarized states can be always written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the excitation manifold in which there are exactly @xmath19 photons in the field .",
    "all the coefficients @xmath20 are real and nonnegative and to ensure the unit - trace condition of the density operator they must satisfy @xmath21    in the following , the basis states of the excitation manifold @xmath19 will be denoted as @xmath22 .",
    "these states span a su(2 ) invariant subspace of dimension @xmath23 , and the generators @xmath13 act therein according to @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "these su(2 ) invariant subspaces will play a key role in the following .",
    "as we have discussed before , measures of nonclassicality have been defined as the ( minimum ) distance to an appropriate set representing classical states  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the minimum distance to the ( convex ) set of separable states has been used to introduce measures of entanglement  @xcite . in the same vein",
    ", we propose to quantify the degree of polarization as @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes the set of unpolarized states of the form ( [ denunpol ] ) and @xmath28 is any measure of distance ( not necessarily a metric ) between the two density matrices @xmath29 and @xmath30 , such that @xmath31 satisfies some requirements motivated by both physical and mathematical concerns .",
    "the constant of proportionality in eq .",
    "( [ dop ] ) must be chosen in such a way that @xmath32 is normalized to unity , i.e. , @xmath33 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a check list of six simple , physically - motivated criteria that should be satisfied by any good measure of distance between quantum processes can be found . for our problem",
    ", we impose the following two conditions :    ( c1 ) : :    @xmath34 iff @xmath29    is unpolarized .",
    "( c2 ) : :    energy - preserving unitary transformations @xmath35    leave @xmath36 invariant ; that is ,    @xmath37    the first condition is to some extent trivial : it ensures that unpolarized and only unpolarized states have a zero degree of polarization .",
    "the second takes into account that the requirement that an unpolarized state is invariant under any su(2 ) polarization transformation makes it also invariant under any energy - preserving unitary transformation  @xcite : these include not only the transformations generated by @xmath13 , but also those generated by @xmath38 , which , in technical terms , corresponds to the group u(2 )  @xcite .",
    "it is clear that there are numerous nontrivial choices for @xmath39 ( by nontrivial we mean that the choice is not a simple scale transformation of any other distance ) .",
    "none of them could be said to be more important than any other _ a priori _ , but the significance of each candidate would have to be seen through physical assumptions . to illustrate this point further ,",
    "let us take an extreme example fulfilling the previous conditions  @xcite .",
    "define the discrete distance @xmath40 if the degree of polarization is computed using this distance , we have @xmath41 this therefore tells us only if a given state @xmath29 is unpolarized or not",
    ".    there are authors demanding that @xmath42 is a metric  @xcite .",
    "this requires three additional properties : ( 1 )  positiveness : @xmath43 and @xmath44 iff @xmath45 .",
    "( 2 )  symmetry : @xmath46 . ( 3 )  triangle inequality : @xmath47 .",
    "these are quite reasonable properties , since most distances used in quantum mechanics are based on an inner product and so they automatically fulfill them .",
    "however , there exist pertinent examples in which @xmath48 is not a metric .",
    "for example , the quantum relative entropy  @xcite @xmath49\\ ] ] is not symmetric and does not satisfy the triangle inequality .",
    "nevertheless , it generates a valuable measure of entanglement , and the corresponding degree of polarization satisfies both c1 and c2 .",
    "however , for a detailed analysis we will consider the hilbert - schmidt metric @xmath50 \\ , , \\ ] ] which has been previously studied in the contexts of entanglement  @xcite . since @xmath51 is a metric , condition c1 is satisfied .",
    "it follows from the unitary invariance of the hilbert - schmidt metric that also c2 is satisfied .    according to our general strategy stated in the definition  ( [ dop ] ) , for a given state @xmath29 we should find the unpolarized state @xmath30 that minimizes the distance",
    "@xmath52 if we take into account that the purity of an unpolarized state is @xmath53 we easily get @xmath54 \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the probability distribution of the total number of photons @xmath56 and @xmath57 denotes the matrix elements of the density operator @xmath29 between su(2 ) invariant subspaces .",
    "now , it is easy to obtain the coefficients @xmath20 that minimize this distance .",
    "the calculation is direct and the result is @xmath58 the density operator @xmath59 with these optimum coefficients @xmath60 satisfies the constraint ( [ consl ] ) , and hence minimizes the distance ( [ hsdist ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath61 can be written as @xmath62 with @xmath63    with all this in mind , we can define the hilbert - schmidt degree of polarization by @xmath64 which is determined not only by the purity @xmath65 ( as it happens for other measures",
    "@xcite ) , but also by the distribution of the number of photons @xmath55 .",
    "although the maximum hilbert - schmidt distance between two density operators is @xmath66 , the minimum distance to an unpolarized state is normalized to unity .    using eqs .",
    "( [ unpolpur ] ) and ( [ lnopt ] ) , the hilbert - schmidt degree of polarization can be recast as @xmath67 which makes it easy to verify that it vanishes only for unpolarized states , in agreement with the condition c1 .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that the hilbert - schmidt distance is not monotonically decreasing under every completely positive trace - preserving map ( what is called the cp nonexpansive property ) .",
    "this has motivated that the quantum information community has identified the fidelity as a particularly important alternative approach to the definition of a distance measure for states  @xcite .    in consequence",
    ", as our second candidate of distance we will employ the fidelity ( or uhlmann transition probability ) @xcite @xmath68 ^ 2 \\ , .\\ ] ] a word of caution is necessary here .",
    "there is an ambiguity in the literature : both the quantity  ( [ fid ] ) and its square root have been referred to as the fidelity .",
    "the reader should take this into account when comparing different sources .",
    "the fidelity has many attractive properties .",
    "first , it is symmetric in its arguments @xmath69 , a fact that is not obvious from eq .",
    "( [ fid ] ) , but which follows from other equivalent expressions .",
    "it can also be shown that @xmath70 , with equality in the second inequality iff @xmath71 .",
    "this means that the fidelity is not a metric as such , but serves rather as a generalized measure of the overlap between two quantum states .",
    "a common way of turning it into a metric is through the bures metric @xmath72 \\ , .\\ ] ] the origin of this distance can be seen intuitively by considering the case when @xmath29 and @xmath30 are both pure states .",
    "the bures metric is just the euclidean distance between the two pure states , with respect to the usual norm on the state space .    since the larger the fidelity @xmath73 , the smaller the bures distance @xmath74",
    ", we can define the bures degree of polarization as @xmath75 an alternative definition would be @xmath76 , which arises naturally in the context of quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "it is clear that these definitions order the states @xmath29 in the same way .",
    "unfortunately , we can not find a general expression of the unpolarized state @xmath30 that gives the maximum fidelity .",
    "such a task must be performed case by case and will be illustrated with some selected examples in the next section .",
    "let us conclude this section by noting that the fidelity can be used to define a measure of entanglement @xcite , whereas this is not the case with the hilbert - schmidt metric @xcite .",
    "since the unpolarized states are separable , @xmath77 thus gives an upper bound on the entanglement of @xmath29 .",
    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ phs ] ) that all pure @xmath19-photon states have the same hilbert - schmidt degree of polarization . for such states , denoted @xmath78 , we have @xmath79 the bures degree of polarization for these states can also be readily found : @xmath80 the vacuum is the only unpolarized state , in agreement with condition c1 . note also that the expressions ( [ phsns ] ) and ( [ pbps ] ) apply , e.  g. , to the states @xmath81 . since for them",
    "@xmath82 , classically they would be unpolarized for every @xmath83 ( that is , @xmath84 , even in the limit @xmath85 ) . in our distance - based approach ,",
    "the degree of polarization is a function of all moments of the stokes operators and not only of the first one , as it happens for @xmath86 , which causes this quite different behavior .",
    "we also observe that all these states lying in the @xmath23-dimensional invariant subspace satisfy @xmath87 when their intensity is increased .",
    "next , we define the diagonal states as those that can be expressed as @xmath88 where we let @xmath89 , for all @xmath90 , and @xmath91 is an arbitrary orthonormal basis in excitation manifold @xmath19 .",
    "it then follows from c2 that any two diagonal states whose probability distribution @xmath92 coincide , must have the same degree of polarization . for any diagonal state",
    ", we have @xmath93    to deal with the bures degree of polarization for this example , we first note that @xmath94 where @xmath95 the extremal points of the fidelity are then determined by @xmath96 where @xmath97 is a lagrange multiplier that takes into account the constraint ( [ consl ] ) . solving for @xmath20 and imposing again ( [ consl ] ) to fix the value of @xmath97",
    ", the optimum parameters @xmath20 are found to be @xmath98 in this way , we finally arrive at @xmath99 one can easily prove that @xmath100 so we have the bound @xmath101 it is clear that @xmath102 is necessary for both @xmath103 and @xmath104 to approach unity .",
    "the latter also requires the purity to approach unity , whereas this is not necessary in order to have @xmath105 .    as another relevant example ,",
    "let us consider the case in which both modes are in ( quadrature ) coherent states .",
    "the product of two quadrature coherent states , which we shall denote by @xmath106 , can be expressed as a poissonian superposition of su(2 ) coherent states  @xcite @xmath107 where @xmath55 is the poissonian factor @xmath108 and @xmath109 is the average number of excitations .",
    "the su(2 ) coherent states are defined as  @xcite @xmath110 and the state parameters are connected by the relations @xmath111    taking into account that @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the modified bessel function , eq .",
    "( [ phs ] ) reduces to @xmath114 when @xmath115 we can retain the first term in the asymptotic expansion of @xmath113 to obtain @xmath116 this tends again to unity .",

    "in conclusion , we have shown that quantum optics entails polarization states that can not be suitably described by the ( semi)classical formalism based on stokes parameters .",
    "we have advocated the use of a degree of polarization based on an appropriate distance to the set of unpolarized states . such a definition",
    "is closely related to other recent proposals in different areas of quantum optics and is well behaved even in cases where the classical formalism fails .",
