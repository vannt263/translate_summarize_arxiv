    "+ the nature of the eigenvalues @xmath16 is unknown .",
    "it is unanimously believed that these constants are unrelated to other most important constants in mathematics ; in particular , it is expected that they are neither algebraic numbers nor periods ( periods are numbers like @xmath41 , catalan constant , @xmath42 , and so on ) . moreover , though now more that @xmath43 digits of @xmath44 have been calculated @xcite , there is no rigorous result known which guarantees that the digits of @xmath44 we calculate are the true ones .",

    "+ on the other hand , the trace of the operator @xmath39 can be given explicitly .",
    "as an aside , there exist formulas for @xmath45 for @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "these formulas are crucial in mayer s proof @xcite that the fredholm determinant @xmath47 is equal to the selberg zeta function for the full modular group .",
    "here @xmath48 is _ the mayer - ruelle operator _ , which is given by ( [ mr ] ) below .",
    "as was shown in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , we have @xmath49 the last sum can by expanded in terms of inverse powers of @xmath50 .",
    "thus , this implies @xcite @xmath51 the constants @xmath16 have received a considerable amount of attention in recent decades .",
    "nevertheless , there are three outstanding unresolved problems .",
    "as was said before , we henceforth arrange the eigenvalues according to their absolute value @xmath52 .",
    "of course , in case @xmath53 for some @xmath0 , this arrangement is not uniquely defined . despite this",
    ", we have    the following three statements are true :    * simplicity .",
    "the eigenvalues are simple .",
    "moreover , @xmath54 .",
    "the eigenvalues have alternating sign : @xmath55 .",
    "there exists a limit @xmath56 .",
    "the first conjecture was raised by babenko @xcite , the second conjecture can be attributed to mayer and roepstorff @xcite , and the last one most likely was raised by macleod @xcite , and seconded by flajolet and valle @xcite .",
    "it has the following explanation .",
    "the spectrum of the operator @xmath57(x)=\\frac{1}{(x+1)^{2}}f\\big{(}\\frac{1}{x+1}\\big{)},\\quad f\\in\\mathbf{v},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is given by @xmath58 , @xmath59 , where @xmath60 .",
    "it is expected that the terms in ( [ gkw ] ) for @xmath61 act only as small perturbations to @xmath62 . of course , the  sign \" and  simplicity \" conjectures follow from the  ratio \" conjecture for sufficiently large @xmath0 ( provided it is effective and we can verify these conjectures for the first few values of @xmath0 ) .",
    "+ the main target of this paper is to pose yet another conjecture .",
    "it concerns the exact values of the real numbers @xmath16 .",
    "it appears that one can interpolate the whole collection of eigenvalues @xmath16 . for this purpose , consider the following + * procedure .",
    "* for integers @xmath63 , let us define @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( which are rational functions with integer coefficients , and in fact @xmath66 and @xmath67 $ ] ) , by @xmath68 and then recurrently by @xmath69 ( why we underline one binomial coefficient will be explained in the end of this section ) .",
    "this recursion works as follows .",
    "fix @xmath70 .",
    "we will calculate the functions @xmath71 and @xmath72 for @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "let @xmath75 .",
    "suppose we have already calculated them for @xmath76 and @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",
    "the above recursion allows to calculate @xmath79 for @xmath80 . when @xmath81 , this recursion _ a priori _ contains two unknowns : @xmath82 and @xmath83 . nevertheless , the coefficient at @xmath71 of this recurrence is equal to @xmath84 , which vanishes for @xmath81 .",
    "thus , since for @xmath81 the coefficient at @xmath82 is @xmath85 , we find the unique value of @xmath82 .",
    "we will later show that at this stage the function @xmath83 can be defined arbitrarily .",
    "we choose @xmath86 since now @xmath82 and @xmath83 have been identified , we use the recurrence ( [ calc ] ) to find @xmath79 for @xmath87 .",
    "consequently , according to this procedure , we can uniquely determine the rational functions @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "+ at the first glace , the recurrence ( [ calc ] ) has nothing to do with continued fractions .",
    "nevertheless , it definitely does , as is expressed by the following    let us define the rational functions @xmath65 , @xmath88 , as just described .",
    "suppose , @xmath89 are the eigenvalues of the gauss - kuzmin - wirsing operator , ordered by their absolute value .",
    "then @xmath90 and the series converges absolutely .",
    "[ conj2 ]    thus , we claim that the indexing of eigenvalues according to their absolute value is not accidental but rather a canonical one .",
    "this indexing corresponds to the degree of denominator of a rational function @xmath91 ( see the next section ) .",
    "the table 1 in the end of this paper lists the first four rational functions @xmath65 .",
    "the table 3 lists the values of @xmath92 . according to the above conjecture , @xmath93 ( _ the gauss - kuzmin - wirsing constant _ ) .",
    "the table 2 lists numerical values for @xmath94 for @xmath95 and some selected values of @xmath96 .",
    "these calculations match the known digits of @xmath16 very well ( see @xcite for numerical values ) . as in the case with the explicit series for the moments of the minkowski question mark function @xcite ,",
    "the series ( [ main ] ) is not very useful in numerical calculations .",
    "for example , @xmath97 , while the denominator of @xmath98 is approximately @xmath99 .",
    "+ despite this drawback , we believe that the identity ( [ main ] ) is significant : it shows that there exists a unifying approach towards the whole collection of eigenvalues @xmath100 , apart from the approach provided by the trace formulas for @xmath101 .",
    "it is also important that each summand @xmath102 is represented by a rational function with integer coefficients , hence it carries and encodes only a finite amount of information .",
    "notwithstanding , in this paper we do not touch the most interesting question from the number - theoretic point of view ; mainly , the structure of rational functions @xmath65 .",
    "this might be very hard , and it deserves a separate treatment .",
    "+ the idea behind our technique which yields the conjecture [ conj2 ] is as follows ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "we replace _ the calkin - wilf tree _ @xcite ( whose permutation is _ the stern - brocot tree _ and whose intersection with @xmath103 $ ] is _ the farey tree _ ) by a certain tree which depends on a complex parameter @xmath104 , @xmath105 .",
    "this tree is given by the root @xmath106 , and each node @xmath107 generates two offsprings according to the rule @xmath108 & & & & & & & & \\frac{x+1}{\\o}. \\ar@{-}[ullll ] & & } \\label{itf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when @xmath109 , we recover the calkin - wilf tree . for @xmath105 ,",
    "the closure of the direct limit of @xmath110 is a certian julia set @xmath111 @xcite .",
    "the main idea is that this tree collapses to a single point for @xmath112 .",
    "thus , instead of a functional analysis in case @xmath109 , we get a finite dimensional linear algebra for @xmath112 . despite the lack of practicality , this method",
    "have already allowed to better understand the structure of the moments of the minkowski question mark function .",
    "this technique provides information on the eigenvalues @xmath16 as well .",
    "possibly , it can be also applied to the study of the eigenvalues of the laplace - beltrami operator @xmath113 .",
    "+ now we will describe the  dual \" result .",
    "let @xmath114 be a real number .",
    "the mayer - ruelle operator is defined by @xcite @xmath115(x)=\\sum\\limits_{m=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{(x+m)^s}f\\big{(}\\frac{1}{x+m}\\big{)},\\quad f\\in\\mathbf{v}. \\label{mr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is known @xcite that the dominant eigenvalue @xmath116 is positive and simple .",
    "( note that various notations for @xmath116 are in use .",
    "for example , @xmath117 in @xcite , and @xmath118 in @xcite ) .",
    "the function @xmath119 is analytic and strictly decreasing , log concave , it has a meromorphic continuation to the whole complex plane , and for @xmath120 , @xmath121 this function can be given an alternative definition .",
    "for any @xmath122tuple of positive integers @xmath123 , let @xmath124 denote the denominator of the continued fraction @xmath125 $ ] , and let @xmath126 be the set of all such @xmath122tuples . then for @xmath114 , @xmath127 this is the reason why @xmath116 is called _ the pseudo - zeta function associated with continued fractions_. more of its properties can be found in @xcite .",
    "we note that , thanks to the works of mayer @xcite , lewis , and lewis and zagier @xcite , there is a deep connection between spectrum of the laplace - beltrami operator , lewis s three - term functional equation , spectrum of the mayer - ruelle operator @xmath48 , and the zeros of the selberg zeta function .",
    "thus , according to the calculations in @xcite , @xmath128 finally , since @xmath129 also vanishes for @xmath130 being a non - trivial zero of the riemann zeta function , it so happens that @xmath131 shares some zeros with the riemann zeta function as well .",
    "for example , this is the case for the first and the fourth non - trivial zero , ordered by their ( positive ) imaginary part .",
    "further calculations are currently being performed by the author . + for integers @xmath63 , let us define rational functions with rational coefficients @xmath132 and @xmath133 by @xmath134 and then exactly the same way as we defined @xmath135 and @xmath136 using procedure and the recurrence ( [ calc ] ) , subject to the following convention : replace throughout @xmath135 with @xmath137 , @xmath136 with @xmath138 , and replace the underlined binomial coefficient with a simpler one , given by @xmath139 then we have    let @xmath140 and @xmath141",
    ". then @xmath142 and the series converges absolutely .",
    "[ conj3 ]    it is rather remarkable that all the eigenvalues of @xmath39 can be calculated using almost the same recurrence as the one which is used to calculate the dominant eigenvalue of @xmath143 !",
    "+ we finish this section with the following curious corollary .",
    "it is known that @xmath144 , where @xmath145 is the so called _ khinchin - lvy constant _",
    "@xcite . based on the above series",
    ", we can calculate this constant using the truncation of the right hand side of ( [ main2 ] ) .",
    "thus , we have : @xmath146 further , the summations over @xmath147 and @xmath148 produce respectively the following approximations : @xmath149 thus , each time we get a linear form @xmath150 , @xmath151 , which approximates the constant @xmath152 .",
    "though , of course , the approximations are far from being best , it is still a rather curious corollary ! + the series ( [ main2 ] ) can be also applied to calculate _ the hensley constant _ , given by @xcite @xmath153",
    "in this section we present more or less formal derivation of the recurrence ( [ calc ] ) .",
    "as the table 2 suggests , all subsequent statements must have rigorous proofs .",
    "the main ideas behind our method are the same as in @xcite .",
