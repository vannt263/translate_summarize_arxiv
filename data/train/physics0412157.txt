    "this paper provides a rigorous discussion of the concept of spin precession frequency on synchro ",
    "betatron orbits in storage rings . to set the scene we begin by introducing some key physical ideas via the equations of orbit and spin motion and the notion of spin  orbit equilibrium .    the spin expectation value @xmath0 ( `` the spin '' ) in the rest frame of , for example , a proton , an electron or a muon moving in electric and magnetic fields under the influence of the lorentz force precesses according to the thomas  bargmann  michel  telegdi ( t  bmt ) equation @xcite @xmath1 where the precession vector @xmath2 depends on @xmath3 and @xmath4 which are respectively the electric and magnetic fields , and the velocity .",
    "particle motion with respect to the synchronous closed , i.e.  periodic , orbit is described in terms of three pairs of canonical variables which we combine into a vector @xmath5 with six components .",
    "for example , two of the pairs can describe transverse motion and one pair can describe longitudinal ( synchrotron ) motion within a bunch .",
    "since we are dealing with storage rings we take the orbital motion to be bounded . in this paper we ignore radiation , interparticle interactions and interactions with the vacuum system . in ( [ eq:1.1 ] )",
    "the independent variable is the time @xmath6 .",
    "however , since the electric and magnetic guide fields in particle accelerators and storage rings are fixed in space it is more convenient to adopt the standard practice of replacing @xmath6 with the angular position around the ring , the azimuth @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the distance around the ring and @xmath9 is the circumference .",
    "since @xmath10 and @xmath4 depend on @xmath5 and @xmath11 we can now rewrite ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) in the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the precession vector obtained from @xmath14 by rescaling with @xmath15 and transforming to machine coordinates @xcite .",
    "if the beam is in equilibrium , i.e.  if the the phase space density @xmath16 is @xmath17periodic in @xmath11 , we then write it as @xmath18 so that @xmath19",
    ". we normalize it to unity : @xmath20 . the necessary condition for this kind of equilibrium , namely that at a fixed @xmath5 the fields are @xmath17periodic in @xmath11 , is automatically fulfilled in a storage ring .",
    "but of course the boundedness of the motion is also required .",
    "conditions necessary for beam equilibrium and a way of calculating @xmath18 using ergodic theory and the concept of `` stroboscopic averaging '' are described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the statistical properties of the spins are encoded in the quantum mechanical spin density matrix .",
    "but for spin 1/2 particles this can be completely parametrized by the polarization vector @xcite . for particle beams we need the local polarization @xmath21 at each point in phase space @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath21 is the average of the normalized spin vectors , @xmath22 , at @xmath5 , where @xmath23 denotes the euclidean norm .",
    "we define the polarization of the whole beam , the `` beam polarization '' , at a given azimuth as @xmath24 .",
    "since the t  bmt equation ( [ eq:1.2 ] ) is linear in @xmath0 and since the particles at @xmath25 all see the same @xmath26 ,   @xmath27 also obeys the t  bmt equation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the length of  @xmath21 is constant along a phase space trajectory . for a storage ring at fixed energy",
    ", @xmath28 is @xmath17periodic in @xmath11 at a fixed position in phase space @xmath5 so that @xmath29 .",
    "this opens up the possibility of a spin distribution that is the same from turn to turn , i.e.  in equilibrium .",
    "then @xmath27 not only obeys the t  bmt equation , but @xmath21 is @xmath17periodic in @xmath11 for fixed @xmath5 and we then write it as @xmath30 so that @xmath31 .",
    "we denote the unit vector along @xmath32 by @xmath33 .",
    "this also obeys the t  bmt equation along orbits and is @xmath17periodic in @xmath11 : @xmath34 .",
    "the method described in @xcite for constructing @xmath18 can be extended as in @xcite for constructing @xmath35 and from the treatments in @xcite it is clear that the existence of @xmath18 and @xmath35 do not require that the orbital motion be integrable .",
    "but , of course , the conclusions of @xcite are still valid if the motion _ is _ integrable .",
    "moreover , particle motion in storage rings is usually close enough to integrability to allow the motion to be characterized in terms of well defined betatron and synchrotron frequencies .",
    "this , in turn , allows predictions to be made about beam stability via the concept of orbital resonance .",
    "thus , in the remainder of this paper we will assume that the orbital motion is integrable .",
    "then , as we shall see , the stability of spin motion can also be discussed in terms of resonance , namely `` spin  orbit resonance '' .",
    "of course , integrable orbital motion and spin  orbit equilibrium are idealizations .",
    "nevertheless , these idealizations often provide useful starting points for calculations .    for integrable particle motion the position of a particle in phase space",
    "is represented by three pairs of action ",
    "angle variables @xmath36 and is determined by a hamiltonian @xmath37 .",
    "thus the orbital phase space is partitioned into disjoint tori , each of which is characterized by a unique set of @xmath38s .",
    "we now define @xmath39 .",
    "the actions are constants of the motion and for fixed @xmath38 the constant rate of advance of each @xmath40 ,  @xmath41 , is called an _",
    "orbital tune_. these frequencies are the number of oscillations per turn around the ring . in beam physics",
    "such frequencies are often referred to as tunes and we have adopted that usage .",
    "we will only consider storage rings running at fixed nominal energy .    for integrable motion ,",
    "the @xmath17periodicity in @xmath11 of @xmath13 , @xmath30 and @xmath42 is accompanied by @xmath17periodicity in @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "so as well as being a solution to the t  bmt equation along orbits @xmath45 , @xmath42 satisfies nontrivial periodicity conditions . in our later discussions on quasiperiodicity",
    "we will require that it also depend sufficiently regularly on the azimuth and the orbital angles , i.e.  @xmath42 must be `` smooth '' in the sense defined in the main text .",
    "this corresponds to the expectation that @xmath30 also be smooth .",
    "the equilibrium density @xmath18 is also @xmath17periodic in @xmath11 and off orbital resonance it just depends on @xmath38 .",
    "since for every @xmath38 the field @xmath46 is invariant from turn to turn , it is now often called the _ invariant spin field _ ( isf ) .",
    "the isf is a central object in the theory of polarization in storage rings @xcite .",
    "for example , for an isf sufficiently regular in @xmath38 , off orbital resonance and away from the spin ",
    "orbit resonances to be defined below , an upper limit to the equilibrium beam polarization at a particular @xmath11 is @xmath47 and it is reached only when the @xmath48 are parallel .",
    "this is easy to see by noting that if @xmath49 were to vary over a torus , the beam polarization would vary from turn to turn .",
    "so equilibrium implies that @xmath49 is constant over a torus .",
    "the maximum equilibrium polarization on each torus is reached when @xmath50 .",
    "note that a zero value for @xmath51 at some @xmath11 does not mean that the beam is depolarized .",
    "it could well be that the beam is fully polarized at each point in phase space but that the geometry of @xmath52 causes the integral to vanish . then",
    ", if a change of parameters were to change the geometry of @xmath52 so that the integral were to become nonzero , and if the change were carried out adiabatically , the beam polarization would reappear .",
    "furthermore , the fact that the integral vanishes at one position @xmath11 does not mean that it vanishes at other positions .",
    "we prefer to reserve the term `` depolarization '' for a _ definitely irreversible _ loss of polarization such as occurs in the presence of noise or for an _ effectively irreversible _ loss of the kind that can occur when spin ",
    "orbit resonances are crossed @xcite .",
    "although we have introduced @xmath35 via the notion of equilibrium , the integral @xmath51 also contains useful information when the spin distribution is not in equilibrium : @xmath51 gives an upper limit for the time averaged polarization away from spin ",
    "orbit resonances .",
    "the maximum is reached on each torus when the polarization is in equilibrium and with @xmath53 .",
    "see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2.2.8 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4.4 ) .",
    "an example of the origin and behavior of nonequilibrium beam polarization is given in figure 9 in @xcite where large oscillations are evident .",
    "however , polarimeters and particle detectors can not collect data quickly enough to make such oscillations observable .",
    "instead , only the time averaged polarization can be observed or exploited .",
    "but as we have just seen , we can still estimate its maximum value .",
    "that depends only on the geometry of @xmath35 and it is reached for each torus when the spread of @xmath35 is minimized .",
    "the isf also provides a perfect tool for estimating the long term effects on the beam polarization of small perturbations such as radiation @xcite or electric and magnetic fields which cause nonintegrable orbital motion .",
    "in particular , one begins with a spin  orbit system which is invariant from turn to turn , i.e.  with an equilibrium orbital distribution and with spins set parallel to the @xmath33 .",
    "then , since the system is initially in equilibrium , the effects of the perturbations can not be masked by the natural , potentially large , variations of the beam polarization of the kind depicted in figure 9 in @xcite . an ability to construct @xmath33 for integrable orbital motion and understand its behavior is then indispensable .",
    "for our integrable orbital motion of electrons and protons and up to energies of a few gev , an approximate @xmath42 can be calculated in a first order perturbation theory by an extension of the code slim @xcite , and in higher order perturbation theory by the codes , smile @xcite , forget  me  not @xcite and spinlie @xcite . however , for the high magnetic fields characteristic of proton rings running at energies of hundreds of gev , perturbative methods are inadequate .",
    "then the method of stroboscopic averaging as in the code sprint @xcite should be used .",
    "this is a numerical , nonperturbative algorithm and yields high accuracy for real rings even when all modes of orbit oscillation are included simultaneously .",
    "one can also use fourier methods as in the codes sodom2 @xcite or miles @xcite .",
    "sodom2 has been very useful for orbital motion restricted to one plane @xcite .",
    "miles gives explicit formulae which are applicable to some simple models .",
    "so far , the only practical general way to calculate the invariant spin field is to use stroboscopic averaging .    as for any dynamical system",
    "we hope to understand more about spin motion by studying its spectrum of frequencies .",
    "various quantities , which seem at first sight to be related to spin frequencies , can be found in the literature and we will mention some in section 10 . but",
    "a true component of a spectrum quantifies long term behavior .",
    "thus any definition of spin precession frequency should reflect that stipulation .",
    "the choice can be further narrowed by requiring that the spectrum give useful clues about the behavior of _ sets _ of spins , and in particular about the beam polarization .",
    "after all , the experimenters using the beams in storage rings are just interested in the beam polarization , not individual spins .    experience has shown that the best choice for characterizing spin motion in storage rings is the traditional one @xcite , namely the so  called _ amplitude dependent spin tune _ ( briefly `` spin tune '' ) , which we usually denote by @xmath54 .",
    "assuming @xmath35 exists , the spin tune measures the number of spin precessions around @xmath33 , per turn around the ring , for a particle on the orbit @xmath45 and it provides a way to quantify the correlation between the spin motion and the orbital motion which `` drives '' it , and thereby forecast a qualitative aspect of spin motion , namely the degree of regularity of the spin motion .",
    "in particular , the spin motion can in general become very erratic when a spin tune is near a low order resonance condition @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a vector of integers and the quantity @xmath57 is usually called the _ order _ of the resonance . correspondingly , close to spin",
    " orbit resonance @xmath33 can become a very sensitive function of @xmath5 .",
    "this sensitivity has immediate consequences for work with polarized beams .",
    "for example , the maximum attainable equilibrium beam polarization of a stored high energy proton beam can be unacceptably low or the rate of depolarization , due to synchrotron radiation , of a stored electron beam can be unacceptably high @xcite .",
    "note , however , that the @xmath58 on a torus can sometimes be small away from spin  orbit resonance and that proximity to a spin  orbit resonance , especially one of high order , does not automatically imply that the @xmath58 on a torus is low .",
    "the resonance might be very weak .",
    "another feature of our definition of spin frequency is that , as we shall see , it is this quantity whose spectrum one obtains in a straightforward spectral analysis of spin motion during spin ",
    "orbit tracking simulations . in other words : in an ideal world with technology which could select particles on a torus at a fixed @xmath38 , it could be _",
    "measured_.    right at the resonance condition ( [ eq:1.5 ] ) ,",
    "@xmath35 is in general nonunique .",
    "however , as we shall see , our spin  orbit systems exhibit a tendency to avoid exact spin ",
    "orbit resonance . since @xmath59 in general depends on @xmath38 and the particle energy on the closed orbit , @xmath54 usually varies with @xmath38 ( hence `` amplitude dependent spin tune '' ) , and the particle energy on the closed orbit .",
    "we will call the latter the `` beam energy '' .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath35 is a field over the _",
    "six _ dimensional phase space so that synchrotron motion is built in from the start .",
    "thus although @xmath54 varies with the beam energy and @xmath60 and @xmath61 , it does _ not _ change during a period of synchrotron motion . if @xmath35 were defined on four dimensional transverse phase space and the energy oscillations due to synchrotron motion were added as an afterthought , it would not be useful for describing _ equilibrium _ polarization . instead",
    ", we would have to characterize the beam polarization using time averages .",
    "we return to this theme in section 10 . on the closed orbit ,",
    "i.e.  for @xmath62 , an @xmath35 exists which is independent of @xmath63 . we denote it by @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "the calculation of spin tune on the closed orbit presents no problem : it can , as we shall see , be extracted from an eigenvalue of the 1turn spin map . but the definition of spin tune for @xmath65 , i.e.  on synchro ",
    "betatron orbits is much more subtle .",
    "moreover , it requires precision .",
    "notions of spin frequency for synchro ",
    "betatron orbits appearing in the literature are often not precisely presented and some appear to possess no capacity for predicting the qualitative aspects of spin motion in storage rings .",
    "this brings us to the purpose of this paper .",
    "this is to provide a rigorous discussion of the concept of spin precession frequency on synchro ",
    "betatron orbits and thereby consolidate a framework for systematizing and classifying spin motion in storage rings . for this",
    "we make a careful mathematical study of the consequences for spin motion of the periodicities of @xmath66 in @xmath67 and @xmath44 , using precise definitions and carefully formulated theorems and we make use of the isf and other concepts which we distill from the literature and `` folklore '' on spin dynamics in storage rings @xcite .  for example , we will show that under the appropriate conditions , the existence of the isf with the above mentioned periodicities implies that the @xmath11 dependence of the general solutions of ( [ eq:1.2 ] ) will contain five frequencies .",
    "four of them are the orbital tunes @xmath68 and the circulation tune @xmath69 , i.e.  the frequency associated with the @xmath17periodicity in @xmath11 . a fifth tune emerges which , under circumstances to be described , is a spin tune @xmath54 .",
    "the general solutions will then be found to be quasiperiodic with the tunes @xmath70 .",
    "moreover the results obtained here can be viewed as a generalization of floquet theory .",
    "given the confusion surrounding definitions of spin precession frequencies , the treatment of the kind that we provide here seems to be very necessary .",
    "our assumptions about @xmath59 are weak enough to cover the situations of most interest for storage rings , namely typical integrable synchro  betatron motion .",
    "several of our theorems assume the existence of @xmath42 but although we have ways to find approximate @xmath42 , the determination of complete conditions for its existence is an outstanding mathematical issue .",
    "this question can , for example , be investigated using ergodic theory @xcite and the method of stroboscopic averaging .",
    "see @xcite .",
    "moreover , simulations indicate that approximate isfs _ do _ exist .",
    "this means that one obtains objects which , at least approximately , behave like an isf .",
    "moreover in some instances approximations even lead to an @xmath66 for which an exact isf can be found , e.g.  as in the single resonance model - see section 7 .",
    "although we have introduced the vector @xmath42 by studying spin ",
    "orbit equilibrium , it was first discussed by derbenev and kondratenko as a vehicle for constructing joint action ",
    "angle variables for spin and orbital motion from their semiclassical spin ",
    "orbit hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "this hamiltonian is derived from the dirac hamiltonian by a foldy  wouthuysen transformation taken to first order in @xmath71 @xcite . in that picture",
    "the spin tune emerges as the rate of advance of a spin phase @xcite .",
    "the terms at first order in @xmath71 in the derbenev  kondratenko hamiltonian are those containing spin and these terms imply a force of the stern  gerlach ( s  g ) type @xcite . the s ",
    "g forces on trajectories appear at first order in @xmath71 and a `` back reaction '' on the spin of the s ",
    "g perturbation to the orbit would involve an addition to the spin precession rate of order @xmath71 .",
    "however , in this paper the effect of s  g forces on spin and orbit motion is neglected and we just operate with the lorentz force and the t  bmt equation and for the lorentz force and @xmath66 just include , as is usual , the terms of zeroth order in @xmath71 .",
    "there are several reasons for this approach .",
    "first , it is far from clear what form the s ",
    "g forces should take .",
    "in fact there is considerable ambiguity in the choice of the s ",
    "this is covered in detail in @xcite .",
    "see @xcite too and the bibliography in @xcite .",
    "the second ground has to do with the size of the s ",
    "g forces . since the s ",
    "g forces are of first order in @xmath71 they are extremely small compared to the lorentz forces which are of zeroth order in @xmath71 . of the lorentz force on a proton . at a fixed radius",
    "this ratio is essentially independent of the beam energy . the s ",
    "g energy at that radius is of the order of @xmath72 of the kinetic energy .",
    "g energy in a hera dipole magnet is of the order of @xmath73 of the kinetic energy . ]",
    "they are also small compared to typical spurious perturbations to trajectories like noise and collective effects .",
    "so s  g forces would not cause changes of practical significance to the results that we present . in particular , in practical situations in a storage ring there would be no significant change in the phenomenology of spin  orbit resonances even if the s ",
    "g forces were to cause tiny changes in the orbital tunes .",
    "the third ground is that it is far from clear that it makes sense to treat an essentially quantum mechanical system with a classical `` over interpretation '' of the influence of the s ",
    "g force on the spin .",
    "an example of an effect which is not taken into account by a naive application of classical s ",
    "g forces , is given in @xcite .",
    "it is implied there that long term shifts of an orbit due to s ",
    "g forces will be nullified when the spin undergoes a quantum flip and the s ",
    "g force then acts in the reverse direction .",
    "see @xcite for a classical perspective on this . in summary , we believe that a too literal interpretation of the s  g  like forces in the semiclassical spin ",
    "orbit hamiltonian could lead to manipulations and conclusions of little relevance and utility for illuminating the core phenomenology of spin motion in typical storage rings @xcite .",
    "we believe that the first priority is to begin with just the lorentz force and the t  bmt equation .",
    "then , as mentioned earlier , once the equilibrium state of the system has been defined , other influences such as nonlinear fields , noise , collective effects , synchrotron radiation and the very small s ",
    "g  like effects can be included as perturbations .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section 2",
    "we begin by discussing some important consequences of ( [ eq:1.2 ] ) . here",
    "we introduce the central concept of a _ uniform precession frame _",
    "( upf ) and the associated _ uniform precession rate _ ( upr ) .",
    "the upf provides a coordinate system for spin .",
    "then in section 3 we give a detailed discussion of spin motion on the closed orbit where @xmath66 is independent of @xmath63 so that the floquet theorem applies .",
    "sections 2 and 3 contain standard results but we present them in forms which motivate their extension in later sections .",
    "section 4 contains the definition of a quasiperiodic function and collects some properties useful for the discussion following . in particular",
    "it defines a diophantine condition needed for handling a problem with small divisors .",
    "the key ideas are formalized in lemmas 4.3 , 4.7 and 4.8 .",
    "section 5 uses the concept of a upf , quasiperiodic with orbital frequencies , to define the proper upr , the spin tune and spin  orbit resonance .",
    "the main theorem in section 5 is theorem 5.3 which allows us to define equivalence classes of spin tunes .",
    "the presentation in sections 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 is deliberately rather general and abstract .",
    "then in section 6 we introduce a _ field _ called the _ invariant frame field _ ( iff ) which is used to construct upfs .",
    "there we consider the angular phase space as a whole to prove theorems about the concepts introduced in section 5 .",
    "we also connect the abstract ideas introduced earlier to a familiar physical idea , namely that if the orbital tune were off orbital resonance ( @xmath74 only with the vector of integers @xmath75 ) , the existence of a nonunique isf would imply that the system were on spin  orbit resonance .",
    "the main theorems in section 6 are theorems 6.3 - 5 .",
    "theorem 6.3 is used in the proof of theorem 6.5 and it is generally our main tool for showing that a torus is `` well  tuned '' .",
    "the proof of theorem 6.3 relies on theorem 5.3 .",
    "some examples of the formalism for model @xmath66s are presented in sections 6 , 7 and 8 .",
    "note that , except for some examples , we allow the number of action  angle pairs , @xmath76 , to be arbitrary ( but @xmath77 ) although for spin motion in storage rings , the case @xmath78 is the most important . to aid the reader we mark the key equations with a @xmath79 on the left .    as a byproduct of the quasiperiodic structure of the solutions we suggest using spectral analysis as a way of `` measuring '' the spin tune during spin ",
    "orbit tracking simulations and thereby complementing other methods already in use @xcite .",
    "spectral analysis may also lead to a practical method for deciding whether an invariant spin field exists .",
    "these ideas are presented in section 9 and formalized in theorems 9.1 and 9.2 .",
    "the paper is summarized in section 10 where our concepts are also related to simulations and used to discuss some popular notions .    for the rest of the paper , apart from section 10 , we will now adopt a more efficient notation whereby we use the symbols @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , ( @xmath83 ) to mean respectively the list of orbital actions , orbital tunes and orbital angles .  from now on we",
    "will also adopt the frame dependent abbreviations @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 . generally ,",
    "if @xmath63 appears as an independent variable in a function , the function will be @xmath17periodic in @xmath87 . in that case",
    "we say for brevity that the function is @xmath17periodic in @xmath63 .",
    "in terms of the new notation , the t  bmt equation and the equations of orbital motion are @xmath88 where @xmath89 is a real skew ",
    "symmetric @xmath90 matrix with nonzero elements @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "the dot over a symbol denotes differentiation w.r.t .",
    "because the @xmath38 dependence is only parametric , we will often suppress the symbol @xmath38 in @xmath93 and @xmath89 , e.g.  as in @xmath94 .",
    "clearly , @xmath95 is @xmath17periodic in @xmath11 and in @xmath63 . for brevity we just say that functions with such periodicity are @xmath17periodic . on the closed orbit ,",
    "i.e.  for @xmath96 , @xmath89 is independent of @xmath63 .",
    "note that on the torus @xmath96 the angular variables @xmath63 play a largely artificial role because here @xmath89 is independent of @xmath63 .",
    "but their inclusion is very convenient as it allows one to treat all tori on the same basis .",
    "then all definitions , e.g.  that of the isf , apply to all tori .",
    "a function is called @xmath97 , if the function together with all of its partial derivatives up to and including those of order @xmath98 are continuous . in this paper",
    "we will assume that , for fixed @xmath38 , @xmath95 is a @xmath99 function of @xmath100",
    ". a @xmath99 function will be called _",
    "smooth_. the smoothness of @xmath95 corresponds to the fact that in real storage rings , the magnetic and electric fields are smooth functions of space and time . the labels for the definitions , propositions , theorems and lemmas are chosen in a way which indicates their relative positions in the text .",
    "we begin by establishing some basic components of our formalism .",
    "clearly ( [ eq:1.10 ] ) gives @xmath101 and @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 are the actions and phases at @xmath105 .",
    "thus an orbit is labeled by @xmath106 .",
    "but if we consider a fixed torus @xmath103 we often suppress the symbol @xmath103 . by `` a fixed torus @xmath103 '' we mean that the orbital tune has the value @xmath107 and that the spin motion is characterized by the function @xmath108 of @xmath11 and @xmath63 .",
    "equation ( [ eq:1.9 ] ) thus becomes @xmath109 where the real skew ",
    "symmetric @xmath110 is defined by @xmath111 as will become clear from definition 4.1 in section 4 , @xmath112 is a quasiperiodic function of @xmath11 with the tunes ( frequencies ) @xmath113 .",

    "occasionally we call a solution @xmath118 of ( [ eq:2.1 ] ) a `` spin trajectory '' at @xmath104 . the choice @xmath105 for the starting azimuth does not imply a loss of generality as can be seen by considering the general initial value problem @xmath119 for ( [ eq:1.9 ] ) and ( [ eq:1.10 ] ) .    note that @xmath120 and @xmath121 are @xmath17periodic in @xmath104 and that by the smoothness of @xmath110 the principal solution matrix is a smooth function of @xmath122 @xcite",

    "therefore theorem 9.1c implies , for arbitrary @xmath104 , that for every @xmath390 in @xmath1025 the fractional part of @xmath390 is a generalized floquet frequency at @xmath104 , and in particular a spin tune .",
    "thus as conjectured earlier , spin tunes can indeed be obtained by spectral analysis .",
    "theorem 9.1c addresses the spectrum , @xmath1021 , for the conditions stated but gives no information on its dependence on @xmath104 .",
    "however , under certain conditions , the special parameter dependence of @xmath110 given in ( [ eq:5.04 ] ) guarantees that @xmath1021 is independent of @xmath104 as we show in the next theorem .",
    "consider a fixed torus and denote @xmath1026 by @xmath1027 , where @xmath563 is an integer .",
    "we conclude from ( [ eq:5.02 ] ) and ( [ eq:5.04 ] ) that @xmath1028 satisfies the initial value problem @xmath1029 because @xmath1030 is the unique solution of this initial value problem ( see also section 2 ) , we obtain @xmath1031 valid for arbitrary @xmath104 and arbitrary integer @xmath563 .",
    "thus the basic property of @xmath110 in ( [ eq:5.04 ] ) leads to the basic property of @xmath124 as manifested in ( [ eq:9.06n ] ) .",
    "it follows that if @xmath1032 is known at a fixed @xmath104 then it is known for all @xmath1033 with @xmath1034",
    ". then if in addition @xmath775 is nonresonant it follows by continuity that it is known for all @xmath63 on the torus .",
    "consider a fixed torus @xmath103 off orbital resonance and assume that a @xmath104 exists such that @xmath703 .",

    "moreover , for all @xmath63 , @xmath1037 .    _",
    "proof : _ since @xmath1038 is quasiperiodic , it is easy to see from definition 4.1 that @xmath1039 and the basic identity ( [ eq:9.06n ] ) gives @xmath1040 therefore @xmath1041 for all @xmath1042 , where we also used the fact that @xmath121 is @xmath17periodic in @xmath104 . thus the spectrum of the principal solution matrix on the set @xmath1043 is the same as the spectrum of the principal solution matrix at @xmath104 . because @xmath1044 is nonresonant , @xmath417 is dense in @xmath471 .",
    "now fix @xmath390 and let @xmath1045 for @xmath1046 and assume @xmath1047 so that @xmath1048",
    ". then @xmath1049 where we used ( [ eq:9.002n ] ) for the first equality and where for the second inequality we used the fact that @xmath1050 which follows from the @xmath126 nature of @xmath124 .",
    "as always , @xmath23 denotes the euclidean norm , i.e.@xmath1051 . if @xmath1052 is continuous and @xmath17periodic and defined all over @xmath471 then , since @xmath417 is dense in @xmath471 , @xmath1053 for all @xmath63 and thus @xmath1054 for all @xmath63 .",
    "conversely if , for a given @xmath63 , @xmath1053 then , by exchanging the roles of @xmath63 and @xmath104 , we obtain @xmath1055 so that @xmath1056 for all @xmath63 .",

    "@xmath243    to complete the proof of theorem 9.2 we now show that the conditions of lemma 9.3 are fulfilled , i.e.  that @xmath1060 converges uniformly on @xmath417 , for every @xmath390",
    ". clearly we have @xmath1072 and to show that the limit in ( [ eq:9.007 ] ) is uniform on @xmath417 we estimate @xmath1073 by using the first equality of ( [ eq:9.007 ] ) with @xmath1074 and by noting that @xmath630 is bounded we have , for all @xmath563 , @xmath1075 moreover because @xmath1076 is almost periodic it follows ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 3 ) ) that the convergence in ( [ eq:9.15 ] ) is uniform on the domain @xmath1077 of @xmath563 .",
    "hence ( [ eq:9.13 ] ) implies that @xmath1060 converges uniformly on @xmath417 .",
    "@xmath243    thus we have proved , under the conditions of theorem 9.2 , that @xmath1021 is independent of @xmath104 .    *",
    "remark : *    * remark 2 shows that under the conditions of theorem 9.1 the spin tune can indeed be discovered from a spectral analysis of the spin flow for arbitrary @xmath104 . in particular , since the spin motion is quasiperiodic and the torus is well tuned , the spectrum has at most countably many elements and @xmath1021 will consist of sharp `` lines '' which can then be `` measured '' . moreover , off orbital resonance and under the conditions of theorem 9.2 , all @xmath1021 are equal .",
    "however , if the torus is ill  tuned but the spin motion is quasiperiodic ( so that the spectrum @xmath1021 will consist of sharp lines ) , we expect that the union of the spectra @xmath1021 over the torus will contain uncountably many elements .",
    "the models in remarks 13 and 14 in section 6 provide examples .",
    "note that in the absence of quasiperiodicity or even almost  periodicity , as for example in the moser - siegel model of section 8 , there may be difficulties in even computing the spectrum . in practice",
    ", the spectrum can be obtained by tracking three mutually orthogonal spins along an orbit and storing their values at each of a very large number of turns before applying a discrete fourier transform to the data ( a well - known way of doing numerical fourier analysis can also be found in @xcite ) .",
    "but since this spectrum can be very dense , it can be difficult to identify the spin tunes .",
    "thus it would be useful to begin with small amplitudes , i.e.  tori with small @xmath38 , and look for a @xmath54 close to that for the closed orbit , which can be calculated as in section 3 .",
    "the spin tune at higher amplitudes could then be identified by continuing away from the closed orbit .",
    "we return to this theme in section 10 . finally , tracking a spin trajectory which is parallel to an isf would give a spectrum without @xmath54 .",
    "* of course , there might be cases where the dependence of @xmath1021 on @xmath104 leading to the ill ",
    "tuning mentioned in remark 3 , is very weak so that the sharp lines are just broadened .",
    "intuition suggests that in such cases , spin  orbit resonance  like phenemena might still be expected .",
    "but , of course , the definitive conditions under which such phenomena could occur , will only become clear by careful analysis .",
    "in the foregoing sections we have presented a thorough step by step account of the circumstances under which spin motion may be quasiperiodic on integrable particle orbits and have thereby put previous studies of the concept of spin tune onto a rigorous basis . in particular , we considered integrable orbits in @xmath1078 and by introducing certain conditions ( e.g.  diophantine conditions ) and assuming the existence of an isf we obtained conditions under which the spin motion is in @xmath1079 where @xmath54 is a spin tune .",
    "we have also shown how , by introducing upfs , the spin motion can be represented in terms of generalized floquet forms .    the scenarios covered by our treatment and the relationships between them are summarized by the venn diagram of figure 1 .",
    "the meanings of the domains in figure 1 are as follows :    * inside the black circle : all tori , i.e.  for arbitrary real skew ",
    "symmetric @xmath570 matrices @xmath1080 and arbitrary orbital tunes @xmath107 , which are smooth and @xmath17periodic in @xmath11 and @xmath63 .",
    "* inside the red ellipse : tori which have an isf * inside the blue ellipse : tori , which at every @xmath104 have a proper upf ( note that for those tori every spin trajectory is quasiperiodic ) * inside the green ellipse : tori which are well  tuned ( see section 5 ) * inside the yellow ellipse : tori which are off orbital resonance * inside the pink ellipse : tori with a uniform iff    the numbered circles label specific examples , namely :    * example 1 : the single resonance model off orbital resonance ( see section 7 ) * example 2 : the torus @xmath38 defined in remark 13 in section 6 , for the case of irrational @xmath1081 * example 3 : the single resonance model on orbital resonance ( see section 7 ) * example 4 : the torus defined in remark 13 in section 6 , for the case @xmath1082 * example 5 : a torus defined in remark 14 in section 6 * example 6 : the moser - siegel model ( for certain choices of the parameters @xmath1083 ) - see section 8 * example 7 : see below    analytical solutions for spin motion or the isf for the @xmath95s arising in real storage rings can not be obtained and it is not even known whether an isf exists in general .",
    "nevertheless it seems that it usually exists for storage rings of interest .",
    "this is supported by a large amount of numerical work in which , for the cases studied , it was possible to construct at least a very good approximation to an isf @xcite .",
    "note that in these simulations hard edge and some thin lens representations of fields were used so that the @xmath95s were not smooth .",
    "see remark 16 in section 6 .",
    "those studies also included calculations of the spin tune using sprint , either beginning with the pseudo@xmath750axes or using the sodom2 algorithm whereby the spin tune is obtained by solving an eigenproblem for fourier coefficients in an su(2 ) formalism .",
    "numerical simulations with both methods suggest that a spin tune normally exists if the torus is off orbital resonance .",
    "this is the situation considered by theorem 6.5d which implies that if we have a isf @xmath735 and if a @xmath17periodic unit vector exists which is nowhere parallel to @xmath735 , then we almost always have a spin tune ( see remark 5 in section 6 ) .  for this and the other results in this paper it has been convenient to prescribe that the @xmath95s are smooth .",
    "but the demonstration of isfs and spin tunes in @xcite indicates that the smoothness condition can often be relaxed . for convenience ,",
    "in the remainder of this section we will use the term isf in this spirit .",
    "we hope in the future to be able to present a treatment of the isf and the spin tune in which the requirement of smoothness is relaxed .",
    "an example of a situation where an isf might not exist even in crude approximation , namely near 803.5 gev in the hera ring , is given in @xcite .",
    "if the spin motion is nonquasiperiodic , this case would correspond to example 7 in figure 1 .",
    "the spin tune is a crucial quantity for characterizing the stability of spin motion .",
    "spins behave somewhat like driven oscillators where the driver is the magnetic and electric fields along particle orbits . near spin  orbit resonance , there is potential for marked qualitative changes in the spin motion which may then be quite erratic .",
    "the special nature of spin  orbit resonance is already clear from the fact that the isf need not be unique at resonance .",
    "see theorem 6.4 .",
    "moreover , it is clear that it would make little sense to define a spin ",
    "orbit resonance condition in terms of a upr @xmath1084 depending on @xmath104 : such a @xmath1084 would in general take different values for different particles on a torus so that it would be impossible for the particles on a torus to be simultaneously on resonance and there would be no enhancement of our ability to systematize spin motion .",
    "this was the reason for insisting that a torus be well  tuned before considering spin ",
    "orbit resonance .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction and in remark 5 of section 5 , it is clear that @xmath54 can vary with the beam energy and with @xmath38 .",
    "this is confirmed by simulations in sprint @xcite , hence the name `` amplitude dependent spin tune '' . to study the dependence of @xmath679 on @xmath38 ( recall remark 5 of section 5 ) , it is necessary to choose a `` preferred '' member of @xmath679 . for the calculations with sprint",
    "the choice is made as follows .",
    "the spin tune @xmath1085 and the corresponding upf are found on the closed orbit using the method outlined in section 3 . normally @xmath265 is set significantly different from zero in order to ensure that the direction of @xmath1086 is close to the `` design '' direction in spite of the presence of the usual misalignments of the ring @xcite .",
    "then as in remark 3 in section 9 , the preferred spin tune at nonzero amplitudes is selected by requiring that it and the corresponding upf vary continuously with amplitude and reduce continuously to the spin tune and upf on the closed orbit .    with this procedure in place , simulations in which the isf and the spin tune are calculated over a range of fixed amplitudes or energies indeed show that the spin motion can become erratic near a spin  orbit resonance .",
    "moreover , in such cases there is a tendency for the isf to become very sensitive to the parameter being varied . with this prescription",
    ", one also finds that the strongest variations of the isf occur near low order resonances and that high order resonance effects are usually unimportant .  for the details of these calculations and results ,",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "these findings are consistent with perturbation theoretical calculations of the isf as in @xcite .. then the @xmath54 for the closed orbit appears in the resonance factors , not the @xmath54 for nonzero orbital amplitudes . ]",
    "the nonperturbative calculations also show that near spin ",
    "orbit resonance the spin tune tends to avoid exact fulfillment of the resonance condition .",
    "as we have already indicated in remark 3 of section 7 , the spin tune for the single resonance model ( see ( [ eq:7.17 ] ) ) also avoids the spin ",
    "orbit resonance condition as @xmath919 is varied through the condition @xmath963 .    in a ring without so  called siberian snakes ( see below )",
    "the closed orbit spin tune @xmath265 usually varies with the beam energy @xcite .",
    "it is then sometimes implied in the literature that in a beam with a large energy spread , the synchrotron motion causes the particles to oscillate to and fro across spin ",
    "orbit resonances as the spin tune @xmath54 oscillates .",
    "this crossing of resonances is then supposed to be the source of the low beam polarization that would be seen . however , we have seen that a spin tune @xmath54 on a torus @xmath1087 is a constant . as usual we assign @xmath61 to synchrotron motion . thus @xmath54 does _ not _ oscillate and there is no resonance crossing .",
    "nevertheless , we do expect that a large energy spread can lead to small beam polarization .",
    "this is explained by the fact that for particles of large enough @xmath61 , @xmath42 varies strongly with the @xmath44 .",
    "then the maximum permissible equilibrium beam polarization can indeed be small @xcite .",
    "studies of the effect on polarization of real resonance crossing can be found in @xcite .",
    "the consequences for the polarization of crossing first order resonances are usually quantified using the froissart  stora formula @xcite .",
    "but in @xcite it is shown that the froissart ",
    "stora approach can be generalized to describe the change of the polarization at the crossing of higher order resonances too .",
    "this is a further illustration of the value of using a wisely defined spin tune for identifying resonances and for understanding their properties    the spin tune can be obtained in sprint via the pseudo@xmath750axes or by using the sodom2 algorithm .",
    "however , as we have seen in section 9 the spin tune might also be obtained ( `` measured '' ) by a spectral analysis of the spin motion .",
    "this offers an attractive alternative .",
    "as in the case of the other two methods the preferred spin tune would have to be identified among the many spectral lines by matching onto the spin tune of the closed orbit .",
    "we have also seen in section 9 that the isf might be obtainable , if it exists , by spectral analysis of spin motion .",
    "spectral analysis may thus lead to a criterion for deciding whether an invariant spin field exists .",
    "other criteria for the existence of the isf are already available for stroboscopic averaging and the sodom2 algorithm .",
    "we now complete this discussion by mentioning other quantities that have been used in attempts to define a spin precession frequencies .",
    "as explained in remark 3 in section 3 , for motion on the closed orbit the spin tune can be obtained trivially from the complex eigenvalues of the 1turn principal solution matrix .",
    "this does not normally work off the closed orbit since @xmath1088 and for this the @xmath1089 are generally not the complex eigenvalues .",
    "so the reader will agree that on synchro ",
    "betatron orbits the spin tune usually _ can not _ be obtained from the complex eigenvalues of the 1turn principal solution matrix .",
    "in fact in general the real eigenvector of the general 1turn principal solution matrix @xmath1090 starting at @xmath11 is not even a spin trajectory and is not parallel to an isf ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , for example ) : the term `` spin closed orbit '' which is sometimes used for the isf , is inappropriate . moreover in the simulations with sprint the sensitivity of the isf to variation of parameters shows no correlation with the spin precession rate extracted from the complex eigenvalues of the 1turn principal solution matrix .",
    "of course eigenvalues of 1turn principal solution matrices are easy to calculate but for @xmath65 they usually have no useful function .    the model described in ( * ?",
    "* equation 21 ) provides an example .",
    "it concerns orbits which are said in @xcite to be exceptional .",
    "it is stated there that exceptional orbits are characterized by the feature that the spin tune depends on orbital phase and this is discussed in close conjunction with stern  gerlach forces . as we point out in the introduction , s",
    " g forces can have no practical relevance for understanding spin resonance .",
    "the model in @xcite involves the single resonance model ( see section 7 ) and a single thin lens siberian snake .",
    "a siberian snake @xcite of the kind used here is a magnet system that rotates a spin by the angle @xmath1091 around an axis in the plane of the ring @xcite . in the notation of section 7",
    "the parameters in @xcite are @xmath963 and @xmath1092 .",
    "at all @xmath104 the 1turn principal solution matrix @xmath1093 starting at the snake represents a rotation around the vertical by an angle depending linearly on @xmath104 . then the isf is vertical at the snake at all @xmath104 on this torus and for this zero  measure range of @xmath38 , the isf at the snake _ is _ the same as the real unit  length eigenvector of the 1turn principal solution matrix .. ] the orbital tune @xmath93 is arbitrary .",
    "the eigentunes extracted from the complex eigenvalues of @xmath1093 , vary linearly with @xmath104 .",
    "therefore if a particle is followed along an orbit , these eigentunes normally change abruptly between one turn and the next .",
    "other 1turn eigentunes would be obtained if other positions around the ring were chosen for @xmath105 .",
    "nevertheless , it is claimed in @xcite that the eigentune for @xmath1093 is @xmath1094spin tune .",
    "obviously this is not a spin tune in the sense of our treatment .",
    "we have taken account of the fact that an eigentune in the su(2 ) formalism used in @xcite is one half of a corresponding eigentune in our formalism .",
    "although this @xmath1093 and its eigentune are discussed in association with s ",
    "g forces , the inclusion of s  g forces is not necessary to obtain either .",
    "in fact by exploiting techniques additional to those used in this paper one can show that these parameters simply provide an example of ill  tuning and that this case would be entered next to example 6 in the diagram of figure 1 .",
    "the inclusion of s ",
    "g efffects clouds the issue .",
    "it is not clear from @xcite whether these phase dependent eigentunes serve some useful function such as indicating the stability of spin motion .",
    "we give another example of the use of the eigentune of a 1turn principal solution matrix below .",
    "the situation with regard to the utility of eigenvectors and eigentunes is more subtle for tori on orbital resonance where @xmath1095 are rational .",
    "the orbit and @xmath110 are then periodic over an appropriate number , @xmath1096 , of whole turns . thus in analogy with the method in remark 6 in section 3",
    ", there is a possibility of calculating @xmath35 at @xmath105 as the unit  length real eigenvector of the @xmath1096turn principal solution matrix and in general it would be a function of @xmath104 .",
    "the imaginary part of the exponent of a complex eigenvalue of this principal solution matrix would provide the @xmath1096turn advance of the phase of spin rotation around @xmath42 and this could be used to obtain the average 1turn spin phase advance .",
    "this would usually depend on @xmath104 and in such cases it could _ not _ be used to define a spin tune .",
    "but it could be used to define a @xmath813 ( see ( [ eq:6.109 ] ) ) .",
    "so , as is usual at orbital resonance , an isf can exist in general but normally there is no spin tune .",
    "we note in passing that the @xmath1096turn complex eigentunes are @xmath17periodic in @xmath11 and @xmath63 , just like @xmath95 . moreover , because eigenvalues of matrices are invariant under similarity transformations , the eigentunes are invariant when the starting point for the eigenanalysis is shifted _ along the orbit_. examples of an unwise use of the term spin tune can be found in @xcite where the dependence of the multi  turn eigentune on @xmath104 is made explicit .",
    "see @xcite too .",
    "again , a `` tune '' depending on @xmath104 can not be used for studying spin  orbit resonance .",
    "calling such a quantity a spin tune can create confusion .",
    "see remark 4 in section 9 also .    if , on orbital resonance with rational tunes , the torus is ill  tuned , then one can expect that either there are more or fewer proper uprs than one would have on a well  tuned torus .",
    "thus a spectral analysis along the lines of that in section 9 , applied to every @xmath104 on the torus , could be a useful diagnostic tool to signal these two cases of ill  tuning .",
    "note that in the examples in remarks 13 and 14 in section 6 there are too many uprs .",
    "therefore one might expect that on orbital resonance with rational tunes an ill  tuned torus had too many proper uprs .",
    "although an @xmath1096turn eigentune is in general @xmath104 dependent , we might expect that an approximation to the spin tune @xmath54 on a well  tuned torus off orbital resonance could be obtained by setting the orbital tunes to rational values near to the actual tunes but such that @xmath1096 were very large .",
    "indeed this is the essence of a popular perception . in effect , although usually not clearly stated , the underlying hope is that for the smooth guide fields of real rings and for large enough @xmath1096 , the average 1turn spin phase advance is only very weakly dependent on @xmath104 and that therefore a good approximation to @xmath54 can be obtained .",
    "that would be consistent with the heuristic expectation that for large enough @xmath1096 the influence of the initial @xmath104 become diluted .",
    "such behavior might also be expected if the high order fourier coefficients in the @xmath1097 in ( [ eq:6.6 ] ) are very small owing to the smoothness of the fields .",
    "see @xcite for a hint of how the fourier coefficients come in here .",
    "we hope in the future to be able to present a rigorous treatment of this approximation .",
    "this approach has been adopted in @xcite to indicate that off orbital resonance the spin tune is a half integer at most @xmath38 in the model to be discussed in the next paragraph .",
    "however , any attempt to find an approximate value for a spin tune by using @xmath1096turn maps for nearby rational tunes should at least be checked for convergence and consistency .",
    "see remark 4 in section 9 too .",
    "further discussion around the topic of rational tunes can be found in @xcite in which the nature of the so  called `` snake resonances '' is studied .",
    "these refer to a large loss of beam polarization during acceleration in a model in which the spin motion in most of the ring is approximated by the single resonance model and the spin motion is stabilized by pairs of idealized , i.e.  thin lens , siberian snakes @xcite .",
    "the siberian snakes have the effect of fixing @xmath265 at @xmath1098 independently of the beam energy @xcite .",
    "snake `` resonances '' occur at rational orbital tunes @xmath93 for which , in the notation of ( [ eq:5.00 ] ) , @xmath1099 with odd @xmath1100 . in @xcite it is made evident that at these tunes and for most @xmath65 there is no amplitude dependent spin tune so that one is not dealing with spin  orbit resonances .",
    "moreover at most orbital amplitudes the isf defined there ( i.e.  without insistence on smoothness ) is irreducibly discontinuous at some orbital phases @xcite . of course , since rational tunes correspond to orbital resonance , it should come as no surprise , given the content of our paper , that there is no amplitude dependent spin tune in this case .",
    "we have explicitly chosen our nomenclature to be consistent with earlier usage @xcite and thereby contribute clarity to the classification of phenomena .",
    "it could be that the pathological behavior in this model , namely the large loss of polarization , is due to the use of the simplified but singular representation for the snake fields .",
    "in this connection we note with interest that according to simulations for rhic , the loss of polarization during acceleration is less severe when the simulations are carried out with the magnetic fields of real snakes than with the singular fields of thin lens snakes @xcite .",
    "this indicates that predictions from simplified , mathematically singular models should be treated with some caution . for recent experimental work around vertical orbital tunes corresponding to `` snake resonance '' , see @xcite . in any case",
    "the use of the term `` snake resonance '' is a good illustration of the confusion that arises from an imprecise use of the concept of spin  orbit resonance .",
    "a model involving the single resonance model and two thin snakes provides the second example of the use of the eigentune from the 1turn principal solution matrix .",
    "simulations described in @xcite show some loss of polarization for all nonzero @xmath1101 during acceleration , even away from the rational orbital tunes associated with snake `` resonances '' .",
    "it is implied there that this loss stems from the fact that during the acceleration , the eigentune from the 1turn principal solution matrix , which in @xcite is called the `` perturbed spin tune '' , oscillates to and fro across a spin  orbit resonance as the orbital phase advances from turn to turn .",
    "but in this example the 1turn eigenvector of the principal solution matrix is usually not even parallel to the isf .",
    "so it is even more difficult to imagine that the `` perturbed spin tune '' can characterize long term spin motion .",
    "thus an alternative picture for the loss of polarization must be sought .    as mentioned in remarks 1 and 4 in section 7 , for the straightforward single resonance model a spin tune _",
    "does _ exist on orbital resonance .",
    "this completes our discussion of notions of spin precession frequency .",
    "we now conclude by summarizing the main message .",
    "this is , that , by just employing the lorentz force and the t - bmt equation and with the help of the concept of quasiperiodicity , we are able to provide a rigorous and broad treatment of the concepts of proper uniform precession rate , spin tune and the invariant spin field by common methods used for ordinary differential equations .",
    "this allows us to focus on the main phenomena without the distraction of perturbations such as noise , collective effects and synchrotron radiation . in principle",
    "they can be included by using perturbation theory .",
    "we have discussed putative stern  gerlach forces in the introduction .",
    "the advantages of a clear , universally accepted and _ useful _ definition of spin tune has been made evident by the examples in the foregoing paragraphs .",
    "we thank georg hoffstaetter , helmut mais , mathias vogt , kaoru yokoya and the late gerhard ripken for important and fruitful discussions on this and related topics . in addition , jae gratefully acknowledges the support from doe grant de - fg03 - 99er41104 and from desy during a sabbatical in 19971998 when the core elements of this work were first assembled into a manuscript .",
