    "in this paper we try to establish the intrinsic characteristics of the stellar sources for the heavy @xmath0-process nuclei ( @xmath0-nuclei with mass numbers @xmath7 corresponding to the elements ba and above ) using aspects of a phenomenological model presented earlier ( wasserburg & qian 2000 ; qian & wasserburg 2001b , 2002 ) . the bulk of the light @xmath0-nuclei ( with @xmath6 ) appear to have different sources from those for the heavy @xmath0-nuclei ( wasserburg , busso , & gallino 1996 ) and are not extensively discussed here . from the observational data on metal - poor ( i.e. , low [ fe / h ] ) stars",
    ", we will show that the heavy @xmath0-nuclei are produced with only some coproduction of the light @xmath0-elements such as sr , y , and zr , but without any coproduction of the elements from na to zn ( including fe ) .",
    "we argue that supernovae with extended shell structure can not be the source for the heavy @xmath0-nuclei . instead ,",
    "these nuclei must be produced during the formation of an essentially bare neutron star .",
    "such a state may result from a low - mass ( @xmath8@xmath9 ) type ii supernova ( sn ii ) or from the accretion - induced collapse ( aic ) of a white dwarf into a neutron star in a binary system .",
    "the observational basis that establishes the distinctive characteristics of the stellar sources for the heavy @xmath0-nuclei is discussed in  2 . in ",
    "3 we discuss the requirement of an essentially bare neutron star for the production of the heavy @xmath0-nuclei and the proposed role of aic events . the special nature of both @xmath0-process and @xmath4-process enrichments in binary systems with aic is discussed in  4 . in ",
    "5 we explore some of the consequences for our earlier model and other implications that follow if aic events are a source for the heavy @xmath0-nuclei .",
    "elemental abundances in halo stars of low metallicities have provided fundamental data for understanding nucleosynthesis and chemical evolution of the galaxy .",
    "the observations ( mcwilliams et al . 1995 ; ryan , norris , & beers 1996 ; burris et al .",
    "2000 ; westin et al .",
    "2000 ; sneden et al .",
    "2000 ; norris , ryan , & beers 2001 ) led us to propose earlier that there was a major transition at [ fe / h ]  @xmath3 in the production of heavy elements .",
    "the fe production at [ fe / h ]  @xmath10 was dominated by very massive ( @xmath11 ) stars ( vmss ) .",
    "it was proposed that the vms activities ceased and major formation of normal stars ( with masses @xmath12@xmath13 ) took over when a critical metallicity corresponding to [ fe / h ]  @xmath3 was reached in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "this is in accord with the recent study by bromm et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , which indicates that substantial formation of a normal stellar population could only occur when a metallicity substantially above @xmath14 times the solar value was achieved in the ism to provide sufficient cooling for the collapse and fragmentation of gas clouds .",
    "the subsequent fe production at @xmath15}<-1 $ ] was then considered to be dominated by sne ii .",
    "the production of the heavy @xmath0-elements relative to fe was very low prior to the achievement of [ fe / h ]  @xmath3 in the ism , but increased sharply at [ fe / h ]  @xmath3 and subsequently approached a well - defined trend for normal stages of galactic evolution ( wasserburg & qian 2000 ; qian & wasserburg 2001b , 2002 ) .",
    "this behavior is shown for eu ( a predominantly @xmath0-process element in the solar system ) in figure 1a where the available data on @xmath16 are plotted versus [ fe / h ] . , where ( e / h ) is the abundance ratio of element e to hydrogen in a star , and @xmath17}\\equiv\\log({\\rm fe / h})-\\log({\\rm fe / h})_\\odot$ ] . ]",
    "it can be seen that for [ fe / h ]  @xmath18 there is a very wide scatter in @xmath16 while for higher values of [ fe / h ] @xmath16 follows [ fe / h ] in a more regular trend .",
    "this trend is indicated by the solid line segment of unit slope in figure 1a and reflects a constant eu / fe ratio for the net production by all stellar sources .",
    "the results for eu are similar to those for ba as shown in figure 1b .",
    "the transition at [ fe / h ]  @xmath3 is prominently demonstrated for ba by the contrast between the data at [ fe / h ]  @xmath10 and those at [ fe / h ]  @xmath19 .",
    "note that this transition reflects the changes in the relative production rates of the heavy @xmath0-elements with respect to fe , and therefore , can be used to identify the nucleosynthetic contributions to the ism from the sources for the heavy @xmath0-elements relative to those from the sources for fe .",
    "for example , the transition for ba corresponds to an increase by a factor of 10 ( solid curve in fig .",
    "1b ) to 20 ( dot - dashed curve in fig .",
    "1b ) in the relative production of ba with respect to fe from [ fe / h ]  @xmath10 to [ fe / h ]  @xmath19 ( qian & wasserburg 2002 ) .",
    "however , the transition at [ fe / h ]  @xmath3 by itself can not identify the relative populations of the different stellar types .    to elucidate the nature of the sources for the heavy @xmath0-elements , we exhibit in figure 2 the available data on hd 115444 , hd 122563 ( westin et al .",
    "2000 ) , and cs 31082001 ( hill et al .",
    "2002 ) with [ fe / h ]  @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , respectively , which show clear evidence for varying degrees of @xmath0-process enrichment within a narrow range of [ fe / h ] .",
    "we note that the data ( not shown ) on cs 22892052 with [ fe / h ]",
    "@xmath23 ( mcwillam et al . 1995 ; sneden et al . 2000 ) are very close to those on cs 31082001 . we also note that high th abundances were found in cs 22892052 and hd 115444 while high th and u abundances were found in cs 31082001 .",
    "it can be seen from figure 2a that the abundances of the elements from na to zn ( including fe ) in the three stars shown there are all rather constant with a typical range of @xmath24 dex in @xmath25 .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the wide range of @xmath26 dex in @xmath25 for the heavy @xmath0-elements ( ba and above ) as shown in figure 2b for the same stars .",
    "figure 2b also shows that the relative abundances of the heavy @xmath0-elements in each star can be described remarkably well by the solar @xmath0-process abundance pattern ( solar @xmath0-pattern ) . indeed , extensive studies ( e.g. , sneden et al .",
    "1996 ; johnson & bolte 2001 ) found that the heavy @xmath0-elements in a number of metal - poor stars often closely follow the solar @xmath0-pattern while having widely varying absolute abundances .",
    "it follows from figure 2 that the sources for the heavy @xmath0-nuclei are not connected with the production of the elements from na to zn , which include not only the fe group but also the so - called `` @xmath27-elements '' mg , si , ca , and ti .",
    "this observation was discussed in our earlier study ( qian & wassurburg 2002 ) of the nucleosynthetic yields which we attributed to vmss and two hypothesized types of sne ii [ sne ii(@xmath28 ) and sne ii(@xmath29 ) ] . in particular ,",
    "the abundances of the elements from na to zn at [ fe / h ]  @xmath3 were considered to represent a prompt inventory of the elements dominantly produced by vmss . the prompt inventory of the light @xmath0-elements sr , y , and zr is also significant ( qian & wasserburg 2001b ) .",
    "this can be seen from the data on hd 115444 and hd 122563 shown in figure 2b .",
    "these two stars have very different abundances of the heavy @xmath0-elements but essentially the same abundances of sr , y , and zr , which are dominated by the prompt inventory of these elements .",
    "compared with hd 115444 and hd 122563 , cs 31082001 have much higher abundances of the heavy @xmath0-elements and significantly higher abundances of sr , y , and zr ( see fig .",
    "this indicates that the sources for the heavy @xmath0-nuclei also produce some light @xmath0-nuclei and such contributions overwhelm the prompt inventory of sr , y , and zr in cs 31082001 . the data on cs 31082001 ( see fig .",
    "2b ) and cs 22892052 ( sneden et al .",
    "2000 ) show that the light @xmath0-elements produced by the sources for the heavy @xmath0-nuclei in these two stars also include nb , ru , rh , pd , ag , and cd . however , the sources for the bulk of the light @xmath0-nuclei appear to be different from those for the heavy @xmath0-nuclei as first argued by wasserburg et al .",
    "( 1996 ) based on the inventory of @xmath30hf and @xmath31i in the early solar system .",
    "this was supported by the data on cs 22892052 ( sneden et al .",
    "2000 ) , cs 31082001 ( hill et al . 2002 ) , bd + 17@xmath323248 ( cowan et al .",
    "2002 ) , and several other metal - poor stars ( johnson & bolte 2002b ) , which showed that the light @xmath0-elements such as ag in these stars are clearly deficient relative to the solar @xmath0-pattern translated to pass through the eu data .",
    "the production of the light @xmath0-elements appears to be associated with that of fe .",
    "this was studied in some detail in qian & wasserburg ( 2001b ) but will not be extensively discussed here .",
    "the range in @xmath25 for eu and ba in many halo stars with [ fe / h ]  @xmath3 shown in figure 1 and the range in @xmath25 for the pure heavy @xmath0-elements in three such stars shown in figure 2 require special attention . if we consider that the solar @xmath0-process abundances represent the galactic average at the time of solar system formation ( ssf ) , and that the absolute yield @xmath33 of element ( or nuclide ) e per h atom in a standard reference mass of ism which will mix with the nucleosynthetic products is constant for every event producing the heavy @xmath0-nuclei , it follows ( see appendix a ) that @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the solar @xmath0-process abundance ratio of e to hydrogen and @xmath36 is the frequency for replenishing the standard reference mass of ism with newly - synthesized material by the events producing the heavy @xmath0-nuclei .",
    "the term @xmath37 is the number of such events per standard reference mass of ism over the period @xmath38 yr prior to ssf . based on the abundance of @xmath30hf ( with a mean lifetime of @xmath39 yr ) in the early solar system ,",
    "@xmath36 was estimated to be @xmath40 ( wasserburg et al .",
    "1996 ; qian & wasserburg 2000 ) .",
    "this gives @xmath41 .",
    "for a metal - poor star formed from the ism in the early galaxy , the number @xmath42 of the events contributing to the abundance of e in the star is @xmath43 where ( e / h ) is the number abundance ratio of e to hydrogen in the star .",
    "for the three stars with [ fe / h ]  @xmath3 shown in figure 2 , their enrichments of heavy @xmath0-elements correspond to @xmath4450 .",
    "while the abundances corresponding to @xmath4410 for e.g. , eu , can be reasonably attributed to the enrichment of an average ism at [ fe / h ]  @xmath3 by the events producing the heavy @xmath0-nuclei , it is rather problematic to consider that @xmath45 such events could have occurred in an average ism without any other events also occurring to change the fe abundance . as argued earlier by us ( qian & wasserburg 2001a ) , the high @xmath0-process enrichments in stars with very low [ fe / h ] such as cs 22892052 and cs 31082001 ( eu and ba data shown as filled diamonds and filled circles , respectively , in fig .",
    "1 ) most plausibly resulted from surface contamination by being a low - mass binary companion to the stellar source for the heavy @xmath0-nuclei .",
    "there is some indication that cs 22892052 might be in a binary ( preston & sneden 2001 ) .",
    "a special case of high eu enrichment at low [ fe / h ] was discovered recently by j. cohen and n. christlieb , who found @xmath46 corresponding to @xmath47 for he 21481247 with [ fe / h ]  @xmath48 ( cohen et al .",
    "2003 ) . the data point ( open diamond in fig .",
    "1a ) for this star lies far above the trend for the evolution of eu relative to fe at [ fe / h ]  @xmath49 .",
    "the result for ba is similar ( see fig .",
    "1b ) . upon being informed of the initial discovery and prior to the detection of pb in this star , we attempted to predict the abundances of all the other elements from only the preliminary data on eu and fe using our earlier model ( qian & wasserburg 2001b , 2002 ) , which assumes no @xmath4-process contributions .",
    "these predictions are shown along with the final data in figure 3a .",
    "it can be seen that in consideration of the observational errors , there is good agreement between the predictions and the data for most of the elements .",
    "this is the case especially for the elements from mg to ni , the predicted abundances of which have significant contributions from the prompt inventory .",
    "however , there is a serious discrepancy for the elements ba , la , ce , pr , and nd as highlighted in figure 3b .",
    "this discrepancy and the detection of high pb abundance in he 21481247 unambiguously demonstrate the presence of high @xmath4-process enrichments in this star [ the pb in this star can not be plausibly attributed to the decay of the actinides produced by the @xmath0-process as the observed value of @xmath50 far exceeds @xmath51 . on the other hand , the ba / eu ratio in this star is @xmath52 times smaller than that for the main @xmath4-component of the solar abundances ( arlandini et al .",
    "we can not construct an @xmath4-process scenario that could decrease the ba / eu ratio greatly below the value for the solar main @xmath4-component .",
    "this and the tentatively inferred th abundance would imply a mixture of high @xmath4-process and high @xmath0-process enrichments in he 21481247 , the explanation of which requires a new approach and is discussed here and in cohen et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "it was well recognized that the high @xmath4-process enrichments in metal - poor stars are associated with mass transfer from their previous asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) companions in binaries .",
    "four such stars with confirmed binary membership are lp 62544 with [ fe / h ]  @xmath53 ( aoki et al . 2000 ) , cs 22948027 with [ fe / h ]  @xmath54 ( hill et al . 2000 ; preston & sneden 2001 ) , cs 22942019 with [ fe / h ]  @xmath55 ( preston & sneden 2001 ) , and he 00242523 with [ fe / h ]  @xmath55 ( lucatello et al . 2003 ) .",
    "there is also evidence for he 21481247 being in a binary ( cohen et al .",
    "2003 ) .    from the above discussion",
    ", it is apparent that : ( 1 ) the production of the heavy @xmath0-nuclei is decoupled from the production of the elements from na to zn ( including the `` @xmath27-elements '' and the fe group ) ; ( 2 ) surface contamination of a low - mass binary companion by the stellar source for the heavy @xmath0-nuclei is a relatively common occurrence ; ( 3 ) surface contamination with @xmath4-process products is a fairly common occurrence ; and ( 4 ) there seems to be a coupling of high @xmath4-process and high @xmath0-process enrichments in at least one metal - poor star .",
    "the fundamental criterion for an astrophysical environment to be the site for @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis is the capability of providing a large neutron abundance on a short timescale .",
    "two major candidate environments are the neutrino - driven wind from new - born neutron stars ( e.g. , woosley & baron 1992 ) and the ejecta from neutron star mergers ( e.g. , freiburghaus , rosswog , & thielemann 1999 ) . in the neutron star merger model , the material undergoing nucleosynthesis",
    "is ejected from a bare old neutron star that is disrupted during the merging with another neutron star or a black hole .",
    "regardless of the possibility of an @xmath0-process , production of the elements from na to zn would not be expected to occur in this material .",
    "thus , if neutron star mergers are a source for the heavy @xmath0-nuclei , the observational requirement that the production of these nuclei not be related to the production of the elements from na to zn is satisfied .",
    "however , due to the rarity of neutron star mergers , very large yields per event are required to account for the total @xmath0-process abundances in the present galaxy if these events are the major source for the @xmath0-nuclei .",
    "the required large yields appear to be in conflict with the level of @xmath0-process enrichment observed in metal - poor stars ( qian 2000 ) .",
    "while the possibility of neutron star mergers being the @xmath0-process site deserves further investigation , here we focus on the neutrino - driven wind from new - born neutron stars as the likely source for the heavy @xmath0-nuclei .",
    "a neutron star can be formed from the collapse of ( 1 ) an fe core of stars with @xmath56 , ( 2 ) an o - ne - mg core of stars with @xmath57@xmath58 , and ( 3 ) a white dwarf which has been accreting material from its low - mass companion in a binary system .",
    "the surface layers of a new - born neutron star are heated by an enormous flux of neutrinos through the reactions @xmath59 and @xmath60 , which results in a neutrino - driven wind ( duncan , shapiro , & wasserman 1986 ) .",
    "this wind was studied as a possible @xmath0-process site but with very uncertain results ( e.g. , woosley & baron 1992 ; meyer et al .",
    "1992 ; takahashi , witti , & janka 1994 ; woosley et al .",
    "independent of these theoretical uncertainties , the observational requirement that the production of the heavy @xmath0-nuclei be decoupled from the production of the elements from na to zn ( including the `` @xmath27-elements '' and the fe group ) strongly constrains the possible association of the above neutron star formation scenarios with the sources for the heavy @xmath0-nuclei .",
    "stars with @xmath56 possess extensive shells surrounding the fe core .",
    "these shells contain the elements from na to the fe group when they are ejected in the sn ii explosion of the star subsequent to the collapse of the fe core ( e.g. , woosley & weaver 1995 ; thielemann , nomoto , & hashimoto 1996 ) .",
    "therefore , sne ii from stars with @xmath56 can not be associated with the source for the heavy @xmath0-nuclei that were observed in the stars shown in figure 2 .",
    "stars with @xmath61@xmath58 have insignificant shells surrounding the o - ne - mg core ( nomoto 1984 ) .",
    "the sn ii explosion resulting from the core collapse of such stars produces essentially no elements from na to zn ( nomoto 1987 ) , and therefore , can be associated with the source for the heavy @xmath0-nuclei as argued earlier by us ( qian & wasserburg 2002 ; see also wheeler , cowan , & hillebrandt 1998 ) .",
    "the accretion - induced collapse ( aic ) of a white dwarf produces a bare neutron star which ejects material only through the neutrino - driven wind .",
    "thus , the aic events can also be a source for the heavy @xmath0-nuclei .",
    "the aic of a white dwarf was initially proposed to explain the origin of neutron stars with low - mass binary companions ( see canal , isern , & labay 1990 for a review ) .",
    "the white dwarf in an aic event may be of c - o composition for a progenitor with @xmath62 or of o - ne - mg composition for a progenitor with @xmath57@xmath63 .",
    "[ due to tidal mass loss , the progenitor mass range for the formation of an o - ne - mg core in binary systems is wider than the range @xmath57@xmath58 for single stars ( nomoto & kondo 1991 ) . ] nomoto & kondo ( 1991 ) showed that in both cases a broad range of mass accretion rates would lead to aic .",
    "studies of nucleosynthesis in the neutrino - driven wind associated with aic events ( woosley & baron 1992 ; fryer et al .",
    "1999 ) found no @xmath0-processing .",
    "instead , these studies showed that elements such as sr , y , and zr are produced profusely by aic events .",
    "this was used to argue that these events should be very rare .",
    "consequently , aic events have not been considered as a serious candidate for the @xmath0-process site .",
    "however , the conditions in the neutrino - driven wind are sensitive to many uncertainties in the neutrino and neutron star physics ( e.g. , qian & woosley 1996 ) . in the arguments presented below , we will assume that the conditions in the wind associated with aic events are suitable for producing the heavy @xmath0-nuclei .",
    "we hope that the observational evidence discussed here would stimulate and possibly guide further theoretical studies of these events in connection with @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis .",
    "as argued above , if the aic events are a source for the heavy @xmath0-nuclei , then the production of these nuclei is automatically decoupled from the production of the elements from na to zn .",
    "in addition , as these events occur in binary systems , the ejecta from such events would naturally lead to contamination of the low - mass companion s surface with heavy @xmath0-elements . as material is ejected through the neutrino - driven wind with only a small total mass loss in the aic events , ablation of the companion",
    "may be insignificant compared with the case of sne ii .",
    "further , the aic model for the production of the heavy @xmath0-nuclei requires that there be a coupling of @xmath0-process and @xmath4-process enrichments in binary systems .",
    "in general , a star evolves through the agb phase prior to becoming a white dwarf .",
    "this evolution results in production of neutrons , the capture of which by the fe seeds gives rise to the @xmath4-process . depending on the distribution of neutron fluence or the ratio of neutrons to the fe seeds , low - metallicity agb stars may predominantly produce pb ( e.g. , van eck et al .",
    "2001 ) as predicted by gallino et al .",
    "( 1998 ) or produce an @xmath4-process pattern similar to the main @xmath4-component of the solar abundances ( e.g. , aoki et al . 2000 ) , or produce some superposition of high pb enrichment and the main solar @xmath4-component ( e.g. , johnson & bolte 2002a ; cohen et al . 2003 ) . in any case",
    ", the @xmath4-process products along with the other elements in the envelope of the agb star may be dumped onto the surface of a low - mass companion via mass transfer in a binary .",
    "if the white dwarf left behind by the agb star subsequently accretes mass from the companion and undergoes aic , the surface of the companion will be enriched again , but this time with heavy @xmath0-elements .",
    "it is also plausible that the ratio of neutrons to the fe seeds in some agb stars would be too low for any significant @xmath4-processing to occur - processing would occur in the star .",
    "however , this star still produces a white dwarf , the aic of which can then provide pure @xmath0-process enrichments to the low - mass companion . ]",
    "( the problem of @xmath4-processing at low metallicities is now attracting considerable attention ) .",
    "thus , the low - mass star in a binary may have a surface composition ranging from predominantly @xmath0-process [ e.g. , possibly cs 22892052 ( sneden et al .",
    "2000 ; preston & sneden 2001 ) ] to predominantly @xmath4-process [ e.g. , lp 62544 ( aoki et al . 2000 ) ] in origin .",
    "the elements c , n , and o will then reflect the normal stellar processing in the low - mass star ( e.g. , fujimoto , ikeda , & iben 2000 ) and additions from the standard evolution of the originally more massive agb companion",
    ". it may be rather common to find metal - poor stars with high surface enrichments of both @xmath4-process and @xmath0-process elements .",
    "we note that a number of metal - poor stars were observed with high @xmath4-process enrichments ( e.g. , hill et al .",
    "2000 ; aoki et al .",
    "2000 ; johnson & bolte 2002a ; lucatello et al . 2003 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the element th , which is unique to the @xmath0-process , is either not targeted for observations or is difficult to detect for these stars .",
    "we know of only one star , he 21481247 , the surface composition of which reflects a superposition of @xmath4-process and @xmath0-process products possibly including th ( cohen et al .",
    "2003 ) .    without th detection , significant @xmath0-process enrichments may still be identified based on the observed abundance pattern of the elements ba and above .",
    "this is because for these elements , the patterns produced by the @xmath4-process are drastically different from the pattern produced by the @xmath0-process . a convenient measure to characterize this difference is the ba / eu ratio . as mentioned earlier , observations showed that the abundances of the heavy @xmath0-elements in a number of metal - poor stars closely follow the solar @xmath0-pattern .",
    "this suggests that the ba / eu ratio for the events producing the heavy @xmath0-nuclei is close to the solar @xmath0-process value ( ba / eu)@xmath64 ( arlandini et al .",
    "1999 ) . by contrast , the ba / eu ratio for the solar main @xmath4-component is ( ba / eu)@xmath65 ( arlandini et al .",
    "1999 ) . due to the variations in the ratio of neutrons to the fe seeds ,",
    "the @xmath4-process in low - metallicity agb stars will in general produce different ba / eu ratios from ( ba / eu)@xmath66 .",
    "the metallicity dependence of the @xmath4-process production pattern was demonstrated by the data ( van eck et al .",
    "2001 ) on three metal - poor stars , the @xmath4-process abundances of which do not follow the solar main @xmath4-component but are characterized by predominant pb enrichments as predicted by gallino et al .",
    "models that were in good agreement with the data on zr , la , ce , pr , nd , sm , and pb in these stars gave the @xmath4-process ratios ( ba / eu)@xmath67 for [ fe / h ]  @xmath68 and ( ba / eu)@xmath69 for [ fe / h ]  @xmath70 ( van eck et al .",
    "thus , it appears that the @xmath4-process always produces ( ba / eu)@xmath71 .",
    "the ba / eu ratio in a star is given by @xmath72 \\beta_r({\\rm ba } ) } , \\label{rba}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 is the fraction of ba contributed by the @xmath0-process .",
    "the ba / eu ratio in the star can also be given by @xmath74 , \\label{seu}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 is the fraction of eu contributed by the @xmath4-process .",
    "a general question is when the @xmath0-process and the @xmath4-process contributions can be identified for a star with a mixture of such contributions . from equation ( [ rba ] ) , the @xmath0-process contributions to the star can be well recognized by the abundance pattern for @xmath76 . from equation ( [ seu ] ) , the @xmath4-process contributions to the star can be identified for @xmath77 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 4 by considering mixtures of the solar @xmath0-pattern and the solar main @xmath4-component . for such mixtures ,",
    "the reference value to be compared with @xmath73 and @xmath75 is @xmath78 .",
    "the dot - dashed curve in figure 4a represents a mixture in which the ba receives equal contributions from the @xmath0-process and the @xmath4-process [ @xmath79 $ ] .",
    "it can be seen that this curve closely follows the solar @xmath0-pattern ( thick solid curve ) and the @xmath4-process contributions are essentially obscured .",
    "this can be understood as only @xmath80 of the eu [ @xmath81 $ ] is contributed by the @xmath4-process .",
    "it follows that if @xmath82 of the ba in a star is from the @xmath0-process , then the abundances of all the elements above ba will exhibit the solar @xmath0-pattern .",
    "the case of @xmath83 corresponding to @xmath84 is also shown in figure 4b .",
    "for comparison , the thin solid curve in figure 4b represents a mixture in which the eu receives equal contributions from the @xmath0-process and the @xmath4-process [ @xmath85 .",
    "it can be seen that this curve closely follows the solar main @xmath4-component ( dashed curve ) .",
    "we emphasize that if @xmath82 of the eu in a star is from the @xmath4-process , the overall abundance pattern will not be easily distinguishable from an @xmath4-pattern .",
    "the identification of the @xmath0-process and the @xmath4-process contributions is also complicated by the observational errors ( @xmath86 dex in @xmath25 ) and by the possible variations of ( ba / eu)@xmath87 . in very uncertain cases ,",
    "the @xmath0-process contributions can only be identified by the data on ir , th , and u , which receive much less or no contribution from the @xmath4-process compared with eu .    the observed abundance pattern of the elements from ba to dy except for gd in he 21481247 can be accounted for by a mixture of the solar @xmath0-pattern and the solar main @xmath4-component with @xmath88 corresponding to @xmath89 .",
    "this mixture is shown as the dot - dashed curve in figure 3b .",
    "we can not offer an explanation for the offset of the gd data from the dot - dashed curve .",
    "for the mixture represented by this curve , both @xmath73 and @xmath75 greatly exceed the reference value of @xmath78 .",
    "consequently , the presence of both the @xmath0-process and the @xmath4-process contributions in he 21481247 can be established based on the observed ba / eu ratio alone .",
    "as the dominant @xmath4-process sources in the galaxy are long - lived low - mass stars , the @xmath4-process contributions to the ism are insignificant at low metallicities corresponding to very early times .",
    "as mentioned earlier , it was well recognized that the high enrichments of @xmath4-process elements in metal - poor stars are associated with mass transfer from their previous agb companions in binaries .",
    "it was thought that all the stars with high @xmath4-process enrichments should have a white dwarf companion now .",
    "some such stars indeed show shifts in their radial velocity ( aoki et al .",
    "2000 ; preston & sneden 2001 ; lucatello et al . 2003 ) .",
    "however , preston & sneden ( 2001 ) showed that these cases are not common and a number of highly @xmath4-process enriched stars appear to be single stars .",
    "according to the above discussion of the aic events , the highly @xmath4-process enriched metal - poor stars , if in binaries , may have neutron stars instead of white dwarfs as companions .",
    "further , the neutron star formed from the aic of a white dwarf may receive a large kick from , e.g. , asymmetric neutrino emission ( e.g. , lai & qian 1998 ) .",
    "this would disrupt the binary and may explain the observed single stars with high @xmath4-process enrichments .",
    "the binary disruption scenario would also imply the existence of highly @xmath0-process enriched single stars as significant @xmath4-processing might not occur in some agb companions ( see footnote 4 ) .",
    "the data on metal - poor stars require that the production of the heavy @xmath0-nuclei be decoupled from the production of the elements from na to zn ( including the `` @xmath27-elements '' and the fe group ) .",
    "this appears to exclude sne ii with progenitors of @xmath56 , or more generally any sne with extended shell structure , from being the source for the heavy @xmath0-nuclei . considering that the heavy @xmath0-nuclei are produced in the neutrino - driven wind from a new - born neutron star",
    ", we have argued that only sne ii from stars with @xmath57@xmath58 and aic events in binary systems , which produce essentially bare neutron stars , satisfy the observational requirement .",
    "while neutron star mergers may also satisfy this requirement , they are not considered here as a major source for the heavy @xmath0-nuclei .",
    "this is because the rarity of neutron star mergers requires very large yields per event , which appear to be in conflict with the observed level of @xmath0-process enrichments in metal - poor stars .",
    "further , neutron star mergers can not produce an intrinsic coupling between @xmath0-process and @xmath4-process enrichments in binary systems . as argued above",
    ", the aic events may naturally lead to contamination of the low - mass binary companions surface with both @xmath4-process and @xmath0-process products .",
    "the @xmath4-process contamination is associated with the agb progenitor for the white dwarf which subsequently undergoes aic into a neutron star .",
    "depending on the distribution of the ratio of neutrons to the fe seeds that results from the evolution of the agb progenitor , the surface composition of the low - mass binary companion can range from predominantly @xmath0-process to predominantly @xmath4-process in origin .",
    "the discovery of a highly - enriched mixture of @xmath4-process and @xmath0-process elements including possibly th in he 21481247 provides strong support for the aic model for the production of the heavy @xmath0-nuclei . in general , as the binary might be disrupted during an aic event , this might explain the existence of single stars with high @xmath4-process enrichments .",
    "the binary disruption scenario would also imply the existence of highly @xmath0-process enriched single stars as significant @xmath4-processing might not occur in some agb companions ( see footnote 4 ) .",
    "subsequent to the disruption of the binary , the highly @xmath4-process or @xmath0-process enriched stars may acquire rather large proper motion .",
    "the aic model can be tested by discovering ( 1 ) more metal - poor stars with high enrichments of both @xmath4-process and @xmath0-process elements including ir , th , and u , ( 2 ) neutron star companions of such stars , and ( 3 ) large proper motion of such stars in single configuration . as some light @xmath0-elements are produced along with the heavy ones in lesser quantities ( qian & wasserburg 2001b ) , the detection of the light @xmath0-elements such as ag may help the identification of @xmath0-process enrichments in a star .",
    "the aic events have no optical display due to the lack of an envelope .",
    "direct observations of these events must rely on the detection of neutrinos from the neutron star formed in such events .",
    "gamma rays from decay of the progenitors of the heavy @xmath0-nuclei , as well as radio signals from the shocked ejecta and the neutron star , may also be observable from an aic event .",
    "there are several questions regarding the generality of the sources for the heavy @xmath0-nuclei that are proposed here based on observations of metal - poor stars .",
    "it is not evident that all the heavy @xmath0-nuclei in the galaxy were produced by low - mass ( @xmath8@xmath58 ) sne ii and aic events .",
    "the mass range of @xmath8@xmath58 corresponds to only @xmath90 of all the stars with @xmath57@xmath13 for a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) of the form @xmath91 . for the low - mass sne ii to constitute @xmath92 of all sne",
    "ii would require a drastic change from @xmath93 to @xmath94 in the exponent of the imf .",
    "thus , low - mass sne ii are perhaps not the major source for the heavy @xmath0-nuclei due to the narrow mass range .",
    "if the proposed aic model is not responsible for the bulk of the heavy @xmath0-nuclei , either , then the question is  what are the major sources for these nuclei ?",
    "if the aic events are the dominant or sole source for the heavy @xmath0-nuclei , then it is necessary to provide a detailed description of the @xmath0-process production and the chemical enrichment associated with this scenario .",
    "first consider the issue of chemical enrichment . in our earlier model ( wasserburg & qian 2000 ; qian & wasserburg 2001b , 2002 ) , we attributed the heavy @xmath0-nuclei to @xmath95 of sne ii [ sne ii(@xmath28 ) ] and the bulk of the light @xmath0-nuclei to the rest [ sne ii(@xmath29 ) ] .",
    "in addition , it was required that sne ii(@xmath29 ) but not sne ii(@xmath28 ) produce the elements from na to zn ( including fe ) . for the model proposed here with aic events being the major source for the heavy @xmath0-nuclei , there is no need to require that most sne ii produce no elements from na to zn .",
    "thus , all sne ii from stars with @xmath56 could be sne ii(@xmath29 ) .",
    "this removes the conflict between our earlier model and observations of sn ii light curves , which showed that most sne ii produce @xmath96 of fe ( e.g. , table 1 in sollerman 2002 ) . with this fe yield and a galactic sn ii rate of @xmath97 , @xmath98 sne ii over the galactic history of @xmath99",
    "yr would enrich the total baryonic mass of @xmath100 in the galaxy with @xmath101 of the solar fe mass fraction ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "this is in accord with the expected additional fe contributions from sne ia .    as in the case of sne ii",
    ", the amount of ism which will dilute the nucleosynthetic products is determined by the total energy injected into the ism .",
    "the energy injected by an aic event is perhaps comparable to that by an sn ii ( woosley & baron 1992 ) , which corresponds to a standard dilution mass of @xmath103 ( e.g. , thornton et al .",
    "if @xmath41 aic events provided this dilution mass with the solar abundances of the heavy @xmath0-nuclei ( see  2 ) , then a total of @xmath104 aic events must have occurred to provide the same enrichment to the total baryonic mass of @xmath105 in the galaxy .",
    "this is @xmath106 times more than the total number of sne ii over the galactic history , and therefore , suggests that the galactic rate of aic events must be @xmath107 if these events are the major source for the heavy @xmath0-nuclei .",
    "the value of @xmath41 used to obtain this rate corresponds to a frequency of @xmath40 for replenishment of the heavy @xmath0-nuclei in the standard dilution mass .",
    "this frequency was inferred from the original measurements of the @xmath30w/@xmath108w deficiencies in iron meteorites relative to the earth s crust , which imply ( @xmath30hf/@xmath109hf@xmath110 in the early solar system .",

    "( 2002 ) give ( @xmath30hf/@xmath109hf@xmath111 . repeating the argument of wasserburg et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for this new value indicates that the frequency for replenishment of the heavy @xmath0-nuclei should be reduced by a factor of @xmath26 , and therefore , the required galactic rate for aic events to be the major source for the heavy @xmath0-nuclei is @xmath112 .",
    "if the galactic rate of aic events is indeed @xmath112 , then the neutrino signals from such an event will be observed in the near future by detectors such as super kamiokande ( sk ) .",
    "the neutrino signals from an aic event should be similar to those from an sn ii .",
    "the dominant signals in a water erenkov detector such as sk are caused by @xmath60 .",
    "eleven @xmath113 events were observed from sn 1987a at a distance of 50 kpc by the kamiokande ii water detector with a fiducial mass of 2.14 kton ( hirata et al .",
    "thus , if an aic event occurs at a distance of 10 kpc , @xmath114 @xmath113 events will be observed by sk with a fiducial mass of 32 kton .",
    "the aic events were originally proposed to explain the formation of low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , which consist of a low - mass star and a neutron star ( see canal et al .",
    "1990 for a review ) .",
    "however , we can not connect the aic events with lmxbs based on the required galactic rate for these events to be the major source for the heavy @xmath0-nuclei .",
    "there are @xmath115 lmxbs observed in the galaxy ( van paradijs 1995 ) .",
    "if the lifetime of an lmxb is @xmath116@xmath117 yr , the birth rate of lmxbs is @xmath118@xmath119 ( verbunt & van den heuvel 1995 ) .",
    "this is far below the galactic rate of sne ii and that of aic events discussed above .",
    "therefore , if the aic events are the major source for the heavy @xmath0-nuclei , these events may have little to do with the formation of lmxbs .",
    "we note that the observed lmxbs have very short orbital periods of @xmath120400 hr ( white , nagase , & parmar 1995 ) while the binary systems containing low - mass stars with high @xmath4-process enrichments tend to have much longer orbital periods of @xmath121 yr ( aoki et al .",
    "2000 ; preston & sneden 2001 ; cohen et al .",
    "it is plausible that the aic events frequently occur in wide binary systems while lmxbs are the rare outcome of the evolution of close binary systems .    the galactic birth rate of pulsars , which are rotating neutron stars with high magnetic fields ,",
    "was estimated to be ( 60330 yr)@xmath122 ( lyne et al .",
    "it is conventional to consider all pulsars as the products of sne ii . as only @xmath123 of the catalogued sn",
    "ii remnants in the galaxy are observed to contain pulsars ( kaspi & helfand 2002 ) , the galactic sn ii rate of @xmath97 is only consistent with the lower end of the estimated pulsar birth rate . if aic events are the major source for the heavy @xmath0-nuclei , the required galactic rate of @xmath112 for these events could easily accommodate the higher end of the estimated pulsar birth rate . in addition , accretion onto the white dwarf in an aic event would provide a natural mechanism to produce a rapidly rotating neutron star , which is required for the pulsar mechanism .    according to the above discussion , if aic events are the major source for the heavy @xmath0-nuclei , their occurrences in the galaxy must have produced @xmath124 neutron stars , which are @xmath125 times more than those produced by sne ii .",
    "this implies that aic events are a frequent outcome of binary evolution , far more common than sne ia . on the other hand ,",
    "progenitor systems of aic events only constitute a fraction of all binary systems , most of which would evolve into white dwarf binaries .",
    "thus , the total number of white dwarf binaries must greatly exceed @xmath5 , which is the number of neutron stars produced by aic events .",
    "these white dwarf binaries could contribute significantly to the inventory of machos .    as discussed in  4",
    ", aic events would lead to high @xmath4-process and high @xmath0-process enrichments in binary systems .",
    "these enrichments are not diagnostic of the composition of the ism from which the binary systems were formed",
    ". there are three distinct times involved here , which correspond to the formation of the binary , the development of the agb phase , and the aic event .",

    ", we must consider the effects of sne ia , which produce dominantly the fe group elements but not the `` @xmath27-elements . ''",
    "the observed transition in the trend for evolution of mg , si , ca , and ti relative to fe at [ fe / h ]  @xmath128 indicates that major fe contributions from sne ia only occur at [ fe / h ]  @xmath129 .",
    "the role of the aic events as the major source for the heavy @xmath0-nuclei especially at [ fe / h ]  @xmath130 then implies severe restrictions on binary evolution .",
    "it is possible that sne ia may only occur through the merging of two white dwarfs , which are produced in binary systems with two low - mass stars ( e.g. , iben 1985 ) . in this case , the onset of sn ia contributions would require a delay of @xmath131 yr similar to that for the onset of major @xmath4-process contributions to the ism .",
    "the parameter space for the mass and the accretion rate of a c - o or o - ne - mg white dwarf leading to aic or an sn ia was studied by nomoto & kondo ( 1991 ) .",
    "more studies of this kind and of binary evolution in general are much needed to assess the possibility of the predominance of aic events over sne ia at [ fe / h ]  @xmath130 .",
    "another crucial issue to be addressed is the @xmath0-process production by aic events .",
    "the diverse nature of the @xmath0-process was inferred from the meteoritic data on @xmath30hf and @xmath31i by wasserburg et al .",
    "this was supported by observations of metal - poor stars , which showed that the light @xmath0-elements such as rh and ag in cs 22892052 ( sneden et al .",
    "2000 ) and cs 31082001 ( hill et al .",
    "2002 ) are deficient relative to the solar @xmath0-pattern translated to pass through the eu data ( see also cowan et al . 2002 ; johnson & bolte 2002b ) .",
    "so far ab initio approaches are unable to define the @xmath0-process yield patterns .",
    "observations ( sneden et al . 1996 ; westin et al .",
    "2000 ; johnson & bolte 2001 ) showed that the heavy @xmath0-elements in a number of metal - poor stars closely follow the solar @xmath0-pattern .",
    "this comparison between the pattern resulting from a very small number of @xmath0-process events ( only a single event in some cases ) at low [ fe / h ] and the solar @xmath0-pattern resulting from many events indicates that the production of the heavy @xmath0-nuclei is well behaved and not very sensitive to the individual production site .",
    "one possible means of obtaining uniform yield patterns for the heavy @xmath0-nuclei would be fission cycling , which tends to produce a robust pattern with two peaks at @xmath132 and 195 , respectively ( e.g. , freiburghaus et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the observational data do not require an invariant yield pattern of the heavy @xmath0-nuclei .",
    "for example , the th / eu ratio in cs 22892052 differs from that in cs 31082 - 001 by an amount that is too large to be explained by the possible age difference between the two stars ( qian 2002 ) .",
    "however , if th is produced but if fission cycling does not occur , the initial ratio of neutrons to the seed nuclei for the @xmath0-process is still rather restricted .",
    "this limits but does not fix the resulting yield pattern . it may be possible to obtain a regular but not fixed pattern for the heavy @xmath0-nuclei including th without fission cycling ( e.g. , qian 2002 ) .    the basic physics of neutron star formation and neutrino emission is essentially the same for both sne ii and aic events . neither process is sufficiently understood to provide a reliable prediction for @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis .",
    "it is hoped that a focused effort on aic models might be fruitful in exploring the problem of @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis without consideration of the complexity of sn ii dynamics .",
    "the neutrino - driven wind associated with aic events requires further studies . among the important physics issues ,",
    "effects of neutrino flavor mixing ( e.g. , caldwell , fuller , & qian 2000 ) and neutron star magnetic field on the conditions in the wind deserve special attention .    in conclusion",
    ", we consider that a strong and coherent case can be made for the production of the heavy @xmath0-nuclei by aic events in binary systems based on observations of metal - poor stars with [ fe / h ]  @xmath3 . more specifically , the production of the heavy @xmath0-nuclei occurs in the neutrino - driven wind from the neutron star produced by the aic of a white dwarf in a binary system .",
    "this scenario provides a coupling between the @xmath0-process and the @xmath4-process as the progenitor for the white dwarf may produce @xmath4-process elements during the agb phase .",
    "whether this scenario with aic may also be the dominant source for the heavy @xmath0-nuclei in the galaxy remains to be investigated .",
    "with regard to our earlier model , the assignment of heavy @xmath0-element production to sne ii(@xmath28 ) must be changed to the aic events .",
