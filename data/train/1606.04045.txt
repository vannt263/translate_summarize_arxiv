    "the first attempts in formulating quantum field theory revealed that the divergences are the integral part of the setup . in order to resolve this problem , heisenberg suggested the noncommutativity between the spacetime coordinates as @xmath0 \\sim{l_{_{\\rm pl}}^2}$ ] , which results in a natural ultraviolet ( uv ) cutoff , of the order of the planck scale , for the system under consideration @xcite .",
    "this suggestion immediately implies a fuzzy structure for spacetime at short distances ( uv regime ) such that the position of particles can not be determined with zero uncertainty .",
    "the appearance of the planck scale shows that this setup will be emerged from the flat ( non - gravitational ) limit of a fundamental quantum theory of gravity .",
    "therefore , it seems that incorporating gravity in quantum physics can naturally remove the divergences in quantum field theory in one side , and also may resolve the singularities in general relativity in the other side .",
    "the noncommutativity between the spacetime coordinates signals a nonzero curvature for the space of the corresponding conjugate variables that is the momentum space .",
    "this is the born s reciprocity conjecture which states that a quantum theory of gravity should be formulated on curved momentum space @xcite .",
    "the first attempt in this direction was taken by snyder in 1947 who has formulated a noncommutative lorentz invariant spacetime @xcite .",
    "the space of momenta then turns out to be curved with de sitter ( ds ) geometry and interestingly it is shown that the quantum field theories are naturally uv - regularized in this setup @xcite .",
    "recently , the relation between the seminal work of snyder and the noncommutativity of spacetime coordinate became clear in the context of doubly ( deformed ) special relativity ( dsr ) theories .",
    "indeed , any quantum theory of gravity such as string theory and loop quantum gravity suggest the existence of a minimal observable length scale @xcite .",
    "it is therefore natural to expect that a non - gravitational theory which supports the existence of minimal length scale ( as a natural uv cutoff for the system ) would emerge at the flat limit of quantum gravity proposal @xcite . in the absence of a full quantum theory of gravity one",
    "may proceed in reverse : one starts with special relativity and deforms it in such a way that it supports the existence of a minimal observer - independent length scale .",
    "this is the main idea of the dsr theories which is suggested by amelino - camelia @xcite .",
    "it is then shown that there are many dsr models @xcite and any model can be understood as a different coordinatization of ds @xcite and also recently proposed ads momentum spaces @xcite .",
    "the snyder model then realized as a dsr model determined by a particular basis of ds momentum space @xcite .",
    "evidently , the dsr models have very different behaviors at the uv regime . for instance , some of them predict dynamical dimensional reduction at uv regime while the others do not @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we consider two deformed special relativity models defined by the same coordinatizations of ds and ads momentum spaces from the thermostatistical point of view .",
    "the model defined on ds momentum space is indeed a dsr theory in the sense that a uv length scale is invariant under the associated deformed lorentz transformations while the lorentz symmetry breaks at the uv regime in the ads case .",
    "this consideration may open a new window to compare the deformed special relativity theories such as the dsr theories from the thermodynamical point of view .",
    "in their modern formulation , dsr theories are defined on curved momentum spaces in the context of relative locality principle @xcite .",
    "the observer - independence of the minimum length scale implies constant curvature for the corresponding momentum space and therefore the ds and ads spaces are the appropriate candidates . from the global point of view",
    "ds and ads spaces have @xmath1 and @xmath2 topologies respectively .",
    "therefore , a maximal momentum and a maximal energy will arise by the relevant identification of compact @xmath3 topology with the space of momenta and @xmath4 topology with the energy space in ds and ads momentum spaces respectively @xcite .",
    "the other identifications lead to the non - isotropic speed of light @xcite . from the local point of view",
    ", different coordinatizations of these curved momentum spaces lead to the different deformed special relativity models .",
    "depending ons which local coordinatizations is employed , the lorentz symmetry may be preserved or broken at the uv regime .",
    "the dsr theories however are defined by those coordinatizations which preserve the lorentz symmetry even in uv regime . among all possible coordinatizations of ds and ads momentum spaces ,",
    "the natural coordinate system on ds momentum space is inspired by the bi - cross product basis of @xmath5-poincar algebra which is known as the cosmological coordinate since it corresponds to the cosmological rendition of ds space in position space . in this model ,",
    "the lorentz transformations are deformed such that the lorentz symmetry preserves even at uv regime .",
    "thus , this is a dsr theory . on the other hand ,",
    "its counterpart on ads momentum space , _ i. e. _ the model that is defined by the cosmological coordinatization of ads momentum space , suggests the lorentz violation at uv regime and therefore it is not a dsr theory . both of these models predict dynamical dimensional reduction from @xmath6 to @xmath7 at uv regime . we restrict ourselves to these two models which are the same coordinatizations of the different ds and ads momentum spaces in order to explore the thermodynamical properties of them .      for the case of free particle , with which we are interested in this paper , dsr theories on curved momentum spaces",
    "are completely defined by the metric of momentum space and also the mass - shell ( modified dispersion relation ) condition ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for more general case ) . in the case of cosmological coordinatization of ds momentum space",
    "the metric is given by ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) @xmath8 the above line element gives the invariant integration measure is considered to recover the standard thermodynamical results at low energy regime .",
    "] @xmath9 on the momentum space . for the massless particles with which we are interested in this paper , the deformed mass - shell relation",
    "is given by @xmath10 in which @xmath11 the mass - shell condition ( [ mass - shell - ds0 ] ) provides two possibilities : @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the latter case leads to the dispersion relations @xmath14 which gives @xmath15 in low energy limit @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , these models do not respect the correspondence principle and we then abandon them .",
    "for the first case with @xmath12 , the modified dispersion relations are given by @xmath17 in the low energy limit @xmath16 , the above relation gives @xmath18 which shows that the constraint @xmath19 is the relevant constraint for the massless particles in this setup .",
    "the appearance of the maximal momentum @xmath20 is another feature of this model which is the consequence of compact @xmath3 topology of the space of momenta @xcite .",
    "moreover , equation ( [ ds - e ] ) implies @xmath21 $ ] if we deal with @xmath22 and @xmath23 for the case of @xmath24 which shows that the solution @xmath24 is positive definite and thus is physically relevant .    in the flat low energy limit",
    "@xmath25 , the line element ( [ metric - ds ] ) reduces to the flat case @xmath26 , the invariant measure ( [ ds - d4p ] ) reduces to the standard well - known measure @xmath27 , and the deformed mass - shell condition ( [ mass - shell - ds ] ) leads to the standard einsteinian dispersion relation @xmath28 with @xmath29 .      in terms of physical energy and momenta",
    "@xmath30 , the line element of ads momentum space in the cosmological coordinate is given by @xmath31 and the invariant measure on the momentum space will be @xmath32 for the massless case , the associated mass - shell condition reads @xmath33 by solving of which one can easily find the modified dispersion relations @xmath34 at the low energy regime @xmath16 , we have @xmath35 which shows that the setup respects the correspondence principle .",
    "also , @xmath21 $ ] for the case of @xmath22 and @xmath23 for @xmath24 .",
    "we therefore again consider @xmath24 to be the appropriate solution for the mass - shell condition . from the above relation it is clear that there exists a maximal energy @xmath36 in this setup .",
    "the relations ( [ metric - ads ] ) , ( [ ads - d4p ] ) and ( [ mass - shell - ads ] ) reduce to their standard counterparts in the flat low energy limit @xmath25 .",
    "in this section we are going to consider the statistical mechanics of a photon gas in the framework of two models that are presented in the pervious section . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the statistical mechanics of such theories with different coordinatizations of ds and ads momentum spaces is generally formulated . here , we briefly review the main results and then we use the setup to find the canonical partition function for the photon gas .    in standard statistical mechanics",
    "one is dealing with an invariant measure on a six - dimensional phase space @xmath37 corresponding to a nonrelativistic particle .",
    "this measure determines the number of microstates for the system by means of which one may study the statistical mechanics in any ensemble .",
    "the deformed special relativity theories such as the dsr theories are , however , formulated on an eight - dimensional extended phase space @xmath38 for a particle while the number of physically distinct microstates is determined by the measure on nonrelativistic phase space .",
    "therefore , one should impose the mass - shell condition and also the gauge transformation generated by it ( time evolution of the system ) to obtain the invariant measure on the space of physically distinct microstates .",
    "this can be easily deduced by using the disintegration theorem which leads to the following invariant measure ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the standard lebesgue measure on the spacetime sector and @xmath41 is the invariant measure on the momentum sector of the extended phase space @xmath38 with @xmath42 being the determinant of the metric of the momentum space .- minkowski spacetime ( @xmath43 in our notation ) @xcite . defining an appropriate measure which respects all the desired symmetries on this noncommutative spacetime is not an easy task",
    "( see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite where it is shown that the standard lebesgue measure leads to the noncyclic action ) .",
    "the standard lebesgue measure however respects the @xmath5-poincar symmetries and also the correspondence principle which is necessary for our aim in this paper .",
    "therefore , we work with the lebesgue measure on the spacetime sector of the extended phase space @xmath44 . ] although the measure ( [ measure - p0 ] ) restrict the eight - dimensional extended phase space @xmath44 to a six - dimensional nonrelativistic phase space , it is indeed not uniquely defined .",
    "for instance , one could also consider @xmath45 instead of @xmath46 which is again consistent but leads to the different statistical results ! at the first glance , one could see that substituting even the standard einsteinian dispersion relation @xmath28 in ( [ measure - p0 ] ) , the delta function decomposes to two separate branches and one of them is indeed corresponding to the negative energies which are irrelevant .",
    "more generally , @xmath46 in ( [ measure - p0 ] ) decomposes as latexmath:[$\\delta({\\mathcal c})=\\frac{\\delta(e - e_{_{+}})}{|\\frac { d{\\mathcal c}}{de}|_{e = e_{_{+}}}}+\\frac{\\delta(e - e_{_{- } } ) } {    definite energies determined by the solution @xmath24 are physically relevant . in order to restrict ourselves to the positive energies",
    ", we thus consider the step function @xmath48 .",
    "the other important issue is the correspondence principle according to which we should recover the well - known results of standard statistical mechanics at the low energy ( or temperature ) regime . in order to do so",
    ", we should replace @xmath46 with @xmath49 .",
    "the correct measure which only includes the positive energies and respects the correspondence principle , then uniquely determined and is given by @xmath50 having the measure ( [ measure - p ] ) at hand , we are adequately equipped to study the statistical mechanics for deformed special relativity theories in any ensemble . in canonical ensemble ,",
    "the system is supposed to be in thermal bath with temperature @xmath51 and the ensemble density is given by the boltzmann factor . the associated single - particle partition function",
    "is then given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 is defined in ( [ measure - p ] ) .",
    "the total partition function @xmath54 of a @xmath55-particles system can be written as @xmath56 , when particles are assumed to be kinematically and dynamically decoupled .",
    "all the thermodynamical quantities then can be derived from @xmath54 by the standard definitions .    before obtaining the deformed partition functions for the photon gas in deformed special relativity models with ds and ads momentum spaces , it is useful to obtain the well - known partition function of the photon gas in standard special relativity within the constructed setup . in the framework of standard special relativity ,",
    "the measures are the standard lebesgue measures @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and the mass - shell condition for the massless particles is given by the standard einsteinian dispersion relation @xmath59 which has the solutions @xmath60 . substituting in relation ( [ pf - def ] ) , the partition function for the photon gas will be @xmath61\\exp(-e / t ) \\nonumber\\\\&=\\frac{4\\pi{v}}{h^3}\\int\\int{dep^2dp}\\,\\delta(e - p ) \\exp(-e",

    "the nontrivial effects may occur when the measure @xmath62 or / and the constraint @xmath63 is deformed . in theories with minimal length that formulated on the reduced ( non - relativistic ) phase space such as generalized uncertainty principle @xcite , noncommutative reduced phase spaces @xcite and polymerized phase spaces @xcite , always one of the phase space measure or the dispersion relation is modified ( it depends on what one prefers to work , in canonical ( darboux ) or noncanonical charts on the reduced phase space @xcite ) . in deformed special relativity theories such as the dsr models , depending on the coordinate that one implements , both the measure and",

    "the model defined on the ds momentum space is a dsr theory in the sense that it preserves the lorentz symmetry even at the uv regime .",
    "the ads model is however a deformed special relativity model which supports the existence of a uv length scale but can not preserve the lorentz symmetry at the uv regime .",
    "the results show that the thermodynamical properties of the photon gas are significantly modified at the high temperature regime such that all thermodynamical quantities enhance in the case of ds momentum space and saturate for the ads case .",
    "we found that the existence of maximal momentum in ds momentum space leads to the maximal pressure and maximal temperature at the thermodynamical level while maximal internal energy and maximal entropy emerged in the ads momentum space due to the existence of maximal kinematical energy . in this respect",
    "these spaces are thermodynamically dual to each other much similar to their well - known kinematical duality .",
    "all of these kinematical and thermodynamical uv cutoffs are originated from the compact topologies @xmath3 and @xmath96 associated to the ds and ads momentum spaces . therefore , although , we have considered a particular case of photon gas in canonical ensemble , it seems that these results are common feature of ds and ads momentum spaces .",
    "moreover , there are many deformed special relativity models defined by different coordinatizations of ds and ads momentum spaces and there is not a clear reason to prefer one from the other . our consideration , however , opens a new window to compare these models from the thermodynamical point of view .",

    "<S> in this paper , we study thermostatistical properties of a photon gas in the framework of two deformed special relativity models defined by the cosmological coordinatizations of the de sitter ( ds ) and anti - de sitter ( ads ) momentum spaces . </S>",
    "<S> the ds model is a doubly special relativity theory in which an ultraviolet length scale is invariant under the deformed lorentz transformations . for the case of ads model , however , the lorentz symmetry breaks at the high energy regime . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the existence of a maximal momentum in ds momentum space leads to maximal pressure and temperature at the thermodynamical level while maximal internal energy and entropy arise for the case of the ads momentum space due to the existence of a maximal kinematical energy . </S>",
    "<S> these results show the thermodynamical duality of these models much similar to their well - known kinematical duality . + </S>",
