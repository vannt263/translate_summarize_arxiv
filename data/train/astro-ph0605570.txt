    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are thought to belong to two populations : short bursts and long bursts @xcite .",
    "the localizations by hete-2 @xcite and swift of three `` short population bursts '' ( spbs ) during the summer of 2005 have solved in large part the mystery of spbs .",
    "the localization of grb 050509b by swift led to the first detection of the x - ray afterglow of a short grb , which was found to lie in the vicinity of a large elliptical galaxy at redshift @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the first detection of an afterglow for a spb implied that such bursts also have detectable optical afterglows , and held out the promise that the precise localization of the optical afterglow of a short grb would lead to the identification of the host and a secure measurement of the redshift of a short grb .",
    "it was not long before this promise was fulfilled .",
    "the localization of grb 050709 by hete-2 @xcite led to several firsts for a spb : ( 1 ) the first detection of an optical afterglow @xcite , ( 2 ) the first secure identification of the host galaxy , ( 3 ) the first secure measurement of the redshift ( @xmath18 ) @xcite , and ( 4 ) the first determination of where in the host galaxy the burst occurred @xcite .",
    "no supernova light curve was detected in the case of either burst down to very sensitive limits @xcite .",
    "the localization of grb 050724 by swift @xcite also led to the detection of the x - ray @xcite and optical @xcite afterglows of the burst , a secure identification of the host galaxy , a determination of where in the galaxy the burst occurred , and a secure measurement of the redshift ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the peak fluxes and fluences of grbs 050709 and 050724 , together with their redshifts , imply that these spbs are a thousand times less luminous and energetic than are typical long grbs .",
    "both bursts occurred in the outskirts of their host galaxies , implying that they come from very old systems , as do the facts that the host galaxy of grb 050724 is an elliptical galaxy in which star formation ceased long ago and that no supernova light curve was detected in either case down to very sensitive limits .",
    "these results strongly support the interpretation that many spbs are due to the mergers of neutron star - neutron star or neutron star - black hole binaries @xcite , and are therefore likely associated with the emission of strong bursts of gravitational waves .",
    "in contrast , `` long population bursts '' ( lpbs ) are known to have x - ray @xcite and optical afterglows @xcite , to occur at cosmological distances @xcite in star - forming galaxies @xcite , and to be associated with the explosion of massive stars @xcite .",
    "hete-2 has localized six short - duration grbs so far .",
    "observational results for hete-2localized short - duration bursts grbs 020531 and 050709 have been reported previously @xcite . in this paper , we report the results of hete-2 observations of four other short - duration bursts localized by hete-2 : grbs 010326b , 040802 , 051211 , and 060121 .",
    "these four bursts have @xmath2 durations in the fregate 30 - 400 kev energy band of @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 sec , respectively , yielding probabilities @xmath7 , and @xmath8 that these bursts are spbs on the basis of their @xmath2 durations alone .",
    "all four bursts also have spectral lags consistent with zero .",
    "these results provide strong evidence that all four of these grbs are spbs .",
    "we focus particular attention on grb 060121 , a bright short - duration burst for which both x - ray @xcite and optical @xcite afterglows were detected , and a probable host galaxy identified @xcite .",
    "the light curve of grb 060121 consists of a hard spike followed by a long , soft bump  features that are similar to those of the light curves of the short bursts grbs 050709 @xcite and 050724 @xcite , and are characteristic of many  perhaps all  spbs , as analysis of batse @xcite and konus @xcite short bursts have shown .",
    "this provides additional strong evidence that grb 060121 is an spb .",
    "grb 060121 exhibits strong spectral evolution in both the value of the low - energy spectral index @xmath20 and in the peak energy @xmath12 of the spectrum in @xmath21 , and we find that this spectral evolution obeys the @xcite relation internally .",
    "grb 060121 is the first short grb for which it has been possible to obtain a photometric redshift from the optical and nir afterglow of the burst @xcite .",
    "the results provide strong evidence that grb 060121 lies at a redshift @xmath9 and most likely at a redshift @xmath22 @xcite [ see also @xcite ] , making this the first short burst for which a high redshift has been securely determined [ the short burst grb 050813 may also lie at high redshift @xcite ] . at either redshift ,",
    "the inferred luminosity @xmath23 , and isotropic - equivalent energy @xmath11 , are @xmath16 times larger than those inferred for grbs 050709 and 050724 , and probably for grb 050509b , and are similar to those of long grbs ; and the values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 are consistent with the @xcite relation .",
    "however , adopting the jet opening angles derived from modeling of its afterglow the values of @xmath0 are @xmath13 ergs if @xmath24 and @xmath25 ergs if @xmath10 .",
    "these values are similar to those of the spbs grb 050709 and grb 050724 and @xmath16 times smaller than those of almost all other hard grbs .",
    "they therefore provide additional evidence that grb 060121 is a spb .",
    "hst observations @xcite have shown that the probable host galaxy of grb 060121 is irregularly shaped and undergoing star formation .",
    "the location of grb 060121 appears not to be coincident with the strongest star forming regions in the galaxy , which provides additional evidence that it is an spb .",
    "thus , when taken together , the properties of grb 060121 make a very strong , although not conclusive case , that grb 060121 is an spb .    in  2 , 3 , 4 and 5",
    ", we describe the hete-2 observations of the short - duration bursts , grbs 010326b , 040802 , 051211 , and 060121 , respectively . for each burst",
    "we report their localizations , temporal properties and spectral analyses , including time - resolved spectroscopy of grb 060121 .",
    "we used xspec version 11.3.2 @xcite for all spectral analyses presented here . in ",
    "6 we discuss ten criteria for determining whether a particular burst is an spb or an lpb , consider the properties of the four short - duration bursts in the light of these criteria , and discuss the implications for the nature of these four bursts  especially grb 060121 . in  7",
    "we present our conclusions .",
    "grb 010326b ( trigger h1496 ) was one of the very first grbs detected by hete-2 .",
    "the burst was detected by both fregate @xcite and the wxm @xcite , but it occurred before the availability of real - time optical aspect data .",
    "consequently , analysis of the burst was carried out on the ground and a wxm localization was circulated about 5 hours after the trigger @xcite .",
    "table [ tbl : location ] details the localization time line and figure [ fig : skymap]a shows a skymap .",
    "no optical transient was detected in the wxm error box @xcite .",
    "the initial gcn reported a duration of `` about 4 seconds '' for this burst @xcite , but recent analysis finds a @xmath2 duration in the 85 - 400 kev energy band of @xmath26 .",
    "the duration of the burst increases at lower energies , reaching @xmath27 in the 2 - 10 kev band ( see figure [ fig : t5090]a and table [ tbl : temporal ] ) .",
    "an analysis of the spectral lag for this burst finds lag values of -@xmath28 msec between the 40 - 80 kev and 80 - 400 kev bands , and -@xmath29 msec between the 6 - 40 kev and 80 - 400 kev bands .",

    "as can be seen in figure [ fig : t90_hr ] , the spectral properties of grb 010326b make it the softest short event seen by hete-2 . however , this burst can be classified as a short grb , based on its @xmath2 duration and a spectral lag consistent with zero .",
    "grb 040802 ( trigger h3485 ) was a bright , short burst that was detected by fregate but was only seen in the x - detector of the wxm . as is usual in such cases , we were able to obtain a narrow localization in the x - direction and a much wider localization in the y - direction , derived from the exposure pattern in the x - detector .",

    "the burst structure shows two peaks at @xmath57 and @xmath58 seconds after the trigger .",
    "grb 060121 has a @xmath2 duration in the 85 - 400 kev energy band of @xmath59 seconds .",
    "figure [ fig : t5090 ] and table [ tbl : temporal ] show the dependence of @xmath2 and @xmath60 on energy . the duration of grb 060121 is shorter at higher energies than at lower ( @xmath61 sec in the 2 - 10 kev band ) , as is the case for the short burst grb 020531 @xcite , as well as most long bursts .",
    "the discrepancy between wxm and fregate @xmath2 durations in similar bands in table [ tbl : temporal ] is due to the different background levels and sensitivities of the two instruments , and to the fact that @xmath2 is highly sensitive to the choice of background .",
    "an analysis of the spectral lag for this burst finds lag values of @xmath62 msec between the 40 - 80 kev and 80 - 400 kev bands , and @xmath63 msec between the 6 - 40 kev and 80 - 400 kev bands .    figures [ fig : softbump_lc_1s ] and [ fig : softbump_lc_3s ] show the light curves of grb 060121 in the wxm 2 - 5 kev and 2 - 10 kev energy bands and the sxc 2 - 14 kev energy band from 50 s before the trigger until 300 s after the trigger , binned at @xmath64 and @xmath58 seconds respectively .",
    "visual inspection of these light curves reveals evidence for a long , soft bump beginning about 70 s after the trigger and extending to about 120 s after the trigger in the wxm , and 150 s after the trigger in the sxc . to assess the significance of this soft bump , we compare two models using the likelihood ratio test , one assuming only a flat background is present and one assuming a flat background plus a constant emission lasting from @xmath65 to @xmath66 are present .",
    "we find evidence for the presence of soft emission in the interval from @xmath67 sec to @xmath68 sec in the sxc 2 - 14 kev energy band at a significance level of @xmath69 .",
    "we also find evidence for the soft emission from @xmath70 sec to @xmath71 sec in the wxm 2 - 5 kev and 2 - 10 kev energy bands at significance levels of @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "thus the light curve of grb 060121 consists of a spike plus a long , soft bump beginning about 70 seconds after the spike and lasting about 50 - 90 seconds .",
    "table [ tbl : spectrum ] lists the results of our spectral analysis of this burst . the burst - average spectrum ( t=0 - 10 sec ) of grb 060121 is adequately fit by a ple model , with spectral index @xmath74 and peak energy @xmath75 kev ( see the second - to - last set of entries in table [ tbl : spectrum ] ) .",
    "a fit to a simple pl model is strongly disfavored .",

    "the spectral data for each of the five time intervals are well fit by a ple model ( as were each of the 3 short grbs considered above ) . in each case , a simple pl model is strongly disfavored and fitting to a band model spectrum does not yield any decrease in @xmath38 for the extra degree of freedom , nor is the high - energy pl index @xmath39 constrained by the fit .",

    "table [ tbl : spectrum ] also lists the results of our spectral analysis of the time intervals @xmath81 and @xmath82 sec . the band spectral model is favored over the ple model for the time interval @xmath83 sec as a consequence of the rapid spectral evolution that is occurring within it .",
    "we have calculated the 68% confidence region in the [ @xmath20,@xmath12]-plane for each time interval .",
    "figure [ fig : contours ] shows the dramatic spectral evolution of the burst from a soft spectrum with a low @xmath12 during the rise of the first peak , to a quite hard spectrum with a high @xmath12 during the first peak , followed by softening and a decrease in @xmath12 during the second peak and into the tail .",
    "@xcite showed that the time - resolved spectra of bright batse long bursts obeys internally the @xmath85 relation found by @xcite [ see also @xcite ] . following @xcite , in figure [ fig : int_amati ] , we plot @xmath12 against the average energy flux in each time interval and find that the four points are consistent with a slope of + 2 , as is the case for long grbs .",
    "we have also analyzed the spectrum of the long , soft bump seen in the wxm 2 - 5 kev and 2 - 10 kev time history data .",
    "the wxm 3 - 25 kev spectral data in the time interval @xmath86 sec as measured from the trigger time ( which matches as closely as we can the time interval during which soft emission is present , identified above ) is adequately fit by a simple pl spectrum with a pl index @xmath87 ( see table [ tbl : spectrum ] ) .",
    "the lower right panel of figure [ fig:060121-spec - timeres ] shows the count spectrum and the residuals for the fit to the wxm data .",
    "observations of short - duration grbs , especially grbs 050709 and 050724 , made last summer by hete-2 and swift provide strong evidence that some short - duration grbs come from merging neutron star - neutron star or neutron star - black hole binaries , whereas it has been known for some time that most long - duration grbs come from the collapse of massive stars .",
    "however , as we will discuss below , there are clearly `` short '' grbs ( i.e. , bursts that almost certainly come from the merger of compact binaries ) with durations at least as long as 8 s , and `` long '' grbs ( i.e. , bursts that come from the collapse of massive stars ) with durations at least as short as @xmath57 s. thus , a given `` short '' burst can be longer than many `` long '' bursts , and a given `` long '' burst can be shorter than many `` short '' bursts , making this nomenclature quite awkward .",
    "another possibility might be to classify bursts as `` merger , '' `` magnetar , '' or `` collapsar '' grbs , since the nature of the central engine that produces each kind of burst is key .",
    "however , it seems premature to try to assign bursts to these three classes at this time .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we adopt the terms `` short population burst '' ( spb ) and `` long population burst '' ( lpb ) .",
    "these terms have the advantage of being closely related to the often - used terms `` short burst '' and `` long burst , '' while emphasizing that reference is being made to two different _ populations _ of bursts , many of whose attributes overlap .",
    "we note that there is some evidence from the distribution of batse bursts in duration and hardness for a third population of soft bursts with durations intermediate between those of spb and lpb bursts @xcite .",
    "how this third population of bursts , if it exists , relates to the grbs produced by the merger of compact binaries or the collapse of massive stars , is unknown .    in this section",
    ", we first discuss ten criteria for determining whether a particular burst is an spb or a lpb .",
    "we then consider the temporal and spectral properties of three of the hete-2 short - duration bursts described in detail in this paper , in the light of four of these ten criteria .",
    "we then discuss in detail the properties of the fourth burst , grb 060121 , and consider these properties in the light of all ten criteria .",
    "finally , we consider the properties of eight hete-2 short - duration grbs and twelve swift short - duration grbs observed to date in the light of these ten criteria .",
    "we consider ten criteria for determining whether a particular burst is an spb or a lpb .",
    "these criteria are ( 1 ) duration , ( 2 ) pulse widths , ( 3 ) spectral hardness , ( 4 ) spectral lag , ( 5 ) energy @xmath0 radiated in gamma rays ( or equivalently , the kinetic energy @xmath1 of the grb jet ) , ( 6 ) existence of a long , soft bump following the burst , ( 7 ) location of the burst in the host galaxy , ( 8) lack of detection of a supernova component to deep limits , ( 9 ) type of host galaxy and ( 10 ) detection of gravitational waves .",
    "the redshift distribution of the spbs observed by hete-2 and swift is uncertain , but possibly broad ; the redshift distribution of lpbs is certainly broad .",
    "this broadens the distributions of the properties of the bursts themselves , weakening the power of the first four above criteria to distinguish between spbs and lpbs .",
    "it would therefore be preferable  from both an empirical and a theoretical point of view  to apply these criteria to the properties of the bursts themselves , as measured in the rest frame of the burst . however , this would limit the application of these criteria to bursts whose redshifts are known , which is a small fraction of both populations of bursts .",
    "worse , it is difficult to determine the necessary burst properties in the rest frame of the burst , and in the case of some properties , it is impossible to do so , as we discuss below .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we apply the criteria to the properties of the bursts themselves as measured in the observer frame .",
    "the temporal properties of spbs differ from those of lpbs in two ways : spbs generally have shorter durations than do lpbs and the time histories of spbs generally have much narrower pulses than do lpbs @xcite , as befits both , given the nomenclature for the two populations that we use in this paper .",
    "these two differences in temporal properties can potentially be used to distinguish between spbs and lpbs .    the @xmath60 duration distribution of grbs exhibits two peaks that strongly overlap .",
    "these two peaks are more evident in the @xmath2 duration distribution @xcite , but @xmath2 is more difficult to measure . the peaks in the @xmath2 distribution lie at @xmath2 @xmath88 s and @xmath2 @xmath89 s , and the minimum in between lies at @xmath2 @xmath90 s. the double - peaked @xmath2 duration distribution can be well fit by two ( or three ) lognormal distributions [ see , e.g. , @xcite ]",
    ". however , observational selection effects may affect both the @xmath60 and the @xmath2 duration distributions .",
    "as one example , the short end of the duration distribution very likely reflects the fact that the shortest batse trigger was 64 ms , rather than the intrinsic duration distribution of spbs @xcite .",
    "determining the @xmath60 and @xmath2 durations of grbs in the rest frame of the burst would require taking into account three factors : ( 1 ) cosmological time dilation , which is proportional to @xmath91 ; ( 2 ) the dependence of the duration on the energy band in which it is measured , which is approximately proportional to @xmath92 , and ( 3 ) the fact that @xmath60 and @xmath2 depend on the background level .",
    "the first factor is straightforward to account for .",
    "the second can be accounted for either approximately by using the factor @xmath92 , which is correct on average , or by attempting to measure the @xmath60 and @xmath2 durations in a fixed energy band in the rest frame of the burst  something that is difficult to do , given the possible broad redshift range of spbs and the known broad redshift range of lpbs .",
    "the third is impossible to account for , since it would require knowing the light curve of the burst far below the level of the background ( i.e. , with essentially infinite accuracy ) . in another paper ,",
    "we explore the use of the distribution of the `` emission duration '' introduced by @xcite as a possible criterion for distinguishing between spbs and lpbs @xcite . unlike @xmath60 or @xmath2 durations , the `` emission duration '' can be defined in the rest frame of the burst .    in the present paper",
    ", we restrict ourselves to the use of @xmath2 as a criterion for distinguishing between spbs and lpbs . using the best - fit parameters for the fit to the @xmath2 duration distribution carried out by @xcite for two lognormal distributions , we have developed a likelihood method for determining the probability that a burst is an spb or a lpb on the basis of its @xmath2 duration alone @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : t90_prob ] shows the resulting probability distribution .",
    "a striking feature of the resulting probability distribution is that the @xmath2 duration at which a burst has an equal probability of being a spb or a lpb is @xmath2 = 5 s. the reason is that the duration distribution of spbs is very broad ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "thus , the appropriate duration to use in dividing bursts into spbs and lpbs is @xmath2 = 5 s , _ not _",
    "@xmath2 = 2 s , which is the criterion that is often used to separate the two populations .",
    "pulse widths in spbs are much smaller than those in lpbs @xcite .",
    "the pulse width distribution in spbs has a mean of @xmath94 ms , while that for lpbs has a mean of @xmath95 ms @xcite .",
    "however , both distributions are broad .",
    "therefore , pulse widths provides a good , but not conclusive , criterion for distinguishing whether a particular burst is an spb or a lpb .",
    "the spectral properties of spbs also differ from those of lpbs in two ways : the distribution of hardness ratios for spbs may be somewhat harder than the distribution of hardness ratios for lpbs ; and , at high energies , spbs exhibit zero spectral lag @xcite , whereas all lpbs for which a spectral lag has been measured exhibit non - zero spectral lag @xcite .",
    "these two differences in spectral properties can potentially be used to distinguish between spbs and lpbs .",
    "spbs have often been said to be harder than lpbs [ see , e.g. , @xcite ] . however , the distributions of the hardness ratios for the two populations are broad and overlap greatly , making it difficult to use this criterion to distinguish between spbs and lpbs .",
    "in addition , @xcite has recently shown that the short and long grbs detected by konus - wind appear to have very similar hardness ratios .",
    "figure [ fig : t90_hr ] shows that the hardness ratios for spbs and for the hardest lpbs localized by hete-2 and by swift are also very similar @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is clear from figure [ fig : t90_hr ] that observational selection effects can strongly affect the hardness ratio distributions , since the batse sample of grbs is missing many of the x - ray - rich grbs and all of the xrfs localized by hete-2 .",
    "all of these properties make the hardness ratio a difficult criterion to use to distinguish between spbs and lpbs .",
    "therefore , we do not use this criterion .",
    "extensive studies have shown that , at high energies , spbs exhibit zero spectral lag @xcite , whereas all lpbs for which a spectral lag has been measured exhibit non - zero spectral lag @xcite .",
    "we therefore consider an accurate measurement of spectral lag , if it can be done , to be one of the best criteria for distinguishing between spbs and lpbs .",
    "the spectral lag measurements for a number of the hete-2 short - duration grbs have relatively large uncertainties , making it difficult to reach definite conclusions about whether these bursts are spbs or lpbs on the basis of spectral lag alone . in another paper ,",
    "we explore the use of spectral lag measurements as a means of distinguishing between spbs and lpbs , using the model of the spectral lag distribution for lpbs developed by @xcite and taking into account rigorously the uncertainty in the measurement of spectral lag @xcite .",
    "the energy @xmath0 radiated by a burst in gamma rays is @xmath96 ergs for the spbs grb 050709 , and 050724 , and @xmath97 ergs for _ hard _ lpbs .",
    "we therefore consider @xmath0 to be a good , but not conclusive , criterion for distinguishing between spbs and lpbs .",
    "long , soft bumps were seen in the light curves of the short bursts grbs 050709 @xcite and 050724 @xcite , and appear to be characteristic of many ",
    "perhaps all  spbs , as analysis of batse @xcite and konus @xcite short bursts have shown .",
    "we therefore consider the existence of a long , soft bump to be one of the best criteria for distinguishing between spbs and lpbs .",
    "the precise localizations made possible by detection of the optical afterglows @xcite of the short bursts grbs 050709 @xcite and 050724 @xcite revealed that both bursts occurred in the outskirts of their host galaxies .",
    "in addition , no supernova light curve was detected in either case down to very sensitive limits @xcite .",
    "these results provide strong support for the interpretation that many short grbs are due to the mergers of neutron star - neutron star or neutron star - black hole binaries @xcite .",
    "in contrast , every lpb for which an accurate location has been determined is coincident with a bright star - forming region in the host galaxy @xcite ; indeed , the locations of lpbs are much more tightly concentrated in these star - forming regions than is the blue light from the host galaxy .",
    "we therefore consider the location of the burst to be one of the best criteria for distinguishing between spbs and lpbs .",
    "supernova components have been detected in the optical afterglow light curves of many lpbs , and are a common feature in the optical afterglow light curves of lpbs that lie at redshifts @xmath98 . in contrast , supernova light curves are not expected for spbs that come from the mergers of compact binaries , and none were detected to very deep limits for grb 050509b and grb 050709 @xcite .",
    "we therefore consider the presence or absence of a supernova component in the optical afterglow light curve to be one of the best criteria for distinguishing between spbs and lpbs .",
    "in particular , we regard the clear detection of a supernova component to be very strong evidence that the burst is an lpb , and the lack of detection of a supernova component down to deep limits to be very strong evidence that the burst is an spb , provided that the burst lies at a redshift @xmath98 .",
    "the spb grb 050724 occurred in an elliptical galaxy @xcite in which star formation ceased long ago , as probably did grb 050509b @xcite .",
    "however , two other spbs [ grb 050709 @xcite and grb 051221a @xcite ] occurred in star - forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "indeed , even in some cases where the host galaxy can not be identified , it may be sufficient to demonstrate that the stellar population is old , as @xcite argue for the case of 050813 .",
    "we therefore consider that , if a particular burst occurs in an elliptical galaxy , this is conclusive evidence that it is an spb , while if the burst occurs in a star - forming galaxy , the kind of host galaxy provides no information about whether the burst is an spb or an lpb .",
    "if most spbs are indeed due to mergers of neutron star - neutron star or neutron star - black hole binaries , these events produce powerful bursts of gravitational radiation @xcite that should be detectable by the second - generation laser interferometry gravitational - wave observatory @xcite .",
    "the detection of gravitational waves from a short - duration grb would therefore provide conclusive evidence that the event is an spb .",
    "while it is unlikely that gravitational waves will be detected from a short - duration grb anytime soon , the detection of such waves will eventually be the gold standard for determining whether a burst is an spb , and we therefore include it here .    in summary",
    ", we have discussed ten possible criteria for determining whether a particular burst is an spb or a lpb . based on a careful consideration of the strengths and weaknesses of each of the criteria , we rate spectral lag ;",
    "long , soft bump ; location in the host galaxy ; type of host galaxy ; and detection of gravitational waves as `` gold '' criteria ( i.e. , the best criteria ) ; duration , pulse width , and @xmath0 as `` silver '' criteria ( i.e. , good criteria ) , and spectral hardness as a `` bronze '' criterion ( i.e. , a poor criterion ) .      in this section",
    ", we consider the temporal properties of the four hete-2 short - duration bursts discussed in detail in this paper in the light of criteria ( 1 - 2 ) discussed above .",
    "table [ tbl : recentshb ] shows that three of the four bursts have probabilities @xmath99 of being spbs , based on their @xmath2 durations alone , and that in the cases of grbs 010326b and 060121 , the probability is 0.95 or greater .",
    "the table shows that @xmath100 for four hete-2 short bursts ( grbs 020531 , 021211 , 040924 , and 050709 ) whose properties have been reported elsewhere @xcite , and grbs 020531 and 050709 have probabilities 0.995 and 1.000 of being spbs , based on their @xmath2 durations alone .",
    "a detailed analysis of the pulse widths of the four hete-2 short grbs discussed in detail in this paper and a quantitative comparison of these widths with the pulse width distributions of spbs and lpbs lies beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "however , we are particularly interested in grb 060121 .",
    "we have therefore made very rough estimates of the widths of the three pulses that are most clearly evident in this burst .",
    "these three pulses have fwhms of 600 - 800 ms , 300 - 400 ms , and 300 - 500 ms in the observer frame .",
    "these pulse widths are larger than is typical of spbs and somewhat smaller than is typical of lpbs ; consequently , the widths of the pulses in grb 060121 considered in the observer frame provide no clear evidence one way or another about whether the burst is an spb or a lpb .",
    "however , pulse widths ( unlike @xmath60 and @xmath2 durations ) can be calculated in the rest frame of the burst , and we revisit these pulse widths below , after having discussed the redshift of grb 060121 .",
    "in this section , we consider the spectral properties of the four hete-2 short - duration bursts discussed in detail in this paper in light of criteria ( 3 - 4 ) discussed above .",
    "the burst - average spectra of the four hete-2 short grbs discussed in this paper are characterized by low - energy spectral indices @xmath101 and peak energies @xmath102 .",
    "similar values were found for the two hete-2 short grbs whose spectral properties were reported elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath20 and @xmath12 for the six hete-2 short grbs are typical of those for bright short grbs detected by batse @xcite and for the three short grbs localized by swift for which a ple model is requested by the swift bat spectral data ( see table [ tbl : recentshb ] ) .",
    "we note that in none of the six hete-2 short grbs do the spectral data request a band model ; this is also the case for bright short grbs detected by batse @xcite .",
    "as already reported , we have calculated the spectral lag for the four hete-2 short - duration grbs discussed in detail in this paper .",
    "we have also calculated the spectral lag for four other hete-2 short - duration grbs .",
    "table [ tbl : lags ] shows that the spectral lags measured for six of these eight hete-2 short grbs are consistent with zero , taking into account the uncertainty in the measurement , and that in two cases ( grbs 020531 and 050709 ) the upper limit on any spectral lag is very small .",
    "however , table [ tbl : lags ] also shows that the remaining two hete-2 short - duration bursts ( grbs 021211 and 040924 ) exhibit definite spectral lags .",
    "these two bursts are therefore lpbs , despite the fact that their @xmath2 durations are only 2.7 s and 2.4 s and the probabilities that they are spbs are 0.87 and 0.90 , respectively , on the basis of their @xmath2 durations alone ( see table [ tbl : recentshb ] ) .",
    "the results for these two bursts illustrate the difficulty in determining whether a given burst belongs to either the short or the long classes of grbs , using solely its @xmath2 duration , and the ability of a spectral lag analysis to do so @xcite .",
    "the light curve of grb 060121 consists of a hard spike followed by a long , soft bump , and in this way , it is similar to those of the spbs grb 050709 @xcite and grb 050724 @xcite .",
    "these general features may well be typical of all spbs seen by batse @xcite and konus @xcite .",
    "however , the ratio of the fluence in the burst itself and the fluence in the long , soft bump spans a range of at least @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "the photon number and photon energy fluences of grb 060121 are more than twice those of any of the other four hete-2 short grbs discussed in this paper or of the other two hete-2 short grbs whose properties were reported elsewhere @xcite . the large photon number and photon energy fluences of grb 060121",
    "have allowed us to perform time - resolved spectroscopy of this burst .",
    "we find that the spectrum of grb 060121 exhibits dramatic spectral evolution in both the value of the low - energy spectral index @xmath20 and the value of the peak energy @xmath12 of the spectrum in @xmath21 ( see table [ tbl : spectrum ] and figure [ fig:060121-spec - timeres ] ) .",
    "grb 020531 also showed evidence for modest spectral evolution , but only in the value of its low - energy power - law index @xmath20 @xcite .",

    "both the x - ray afterglow @xcite and near infrared ( nir ) afterglow @xcite of grb 060121 were bright , but the optical afterglow was faint @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , at early times the afterglow was much brighter than the probable host galaxy @xcite in both the optical and the nir .",
    "grb 060121 is consequently the first short grb for which it has been possible to obtain a photometric redshift from the optical and nir afterglow of the burst @xcite .",
    "observations of the afterglow in the i- , r- , and k - bands and the upper limits derived for the u- , b- , and v - bands indicate that the burst occurred at a redshift @xmath104 , or less probably , at a redshift @xmath105 and with a large extinction ( @xmath106 ) @xcite .    further support for a high redshift comes from the unusually red color of the probable host galaxy and the presence nearby on the sky of five extremely red objects ( eros ) , which are exceptionally faint ( and therefore have low surface brightnesses ) or are undetected in the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst )",
    "acs / f606w filter , but are relatively bright in the hst nicmos f160w filter @xcite .",
    "the five nearby eros correspond to an overdensity on the sky of a factor of 20 @xcite , suggesting that the host galaxy of grb 060121 may belong to a cluster .",
    "these results provide strong evidence that grb 060121 lies at a redshift @xmath9 , and most likely at a redshift @xmath10 @xcite [ see also @xcite ] , making this the first spb for which a high redshift has been securely determined .",
    "the @xmath2 duration of the spike in the light curve of grb 060121 is 1.97 s in the 30 - 400 kev energy band , which gives a probability of @xmath107 of grb 060121 being a spb , based on its @xmath2 duration alone .",
    "the spectral lag measurement for the spike in the time history of grb 060121 is @xmath62 ms between the 40 - 80 kev and 80 - 400 kev bands , which is consistent with zero spectral lag .",

    "modeling of the afterglow gives opening angles of @xmath117 if @xmath14 and @xmath118 if @xmath10 , although the uncertainties in the opening angles are substantial @xcite .",
    "taking these opening angles at face value implies that the energy @xmath0 in gamma - rays emitted by grb 060121 is @xmath119 ergs if @xmath14 and @xmath25 ergs if @xmath22 .",

    ", we consider that  of the eight hete-2 short - duration bursts discussed in this paper  there is conclusive evidence that two are spbs ( grbs 020531 and 050709 ) , there is very strong but not conclusive evidence that a third is an spb ( grb 060121 ) , and there is moderately strong evidence that three others are spbs ( grbs 010326b , 040802 , and 051211 ) .",
    "finally , there is conclusive evidence that the remaining two bursts are lpbs ( grbs 021211 and 040924 ) .",
    "we also consider that  of the twelve swift short - duration bursts discussed in this paper  there is conclusive evidence that three are spbs ( grbs 050509b , 050724 , 051227 ) ; compelling evidence that seven of the remaining nine bursts are spbs ; and moderately strong evidence that one of the two remaining bursts is an spb , the sole exception being grb 050202 for which very little information has been reported .",
    "in this paper , we have reported the localizations and observations by hete-2 of four short bursts : grbs 010326b , 040802 , 051211 , and 060121 .",
    "the durations and absence of spectral lags for the four bursts provides strong evidence that all four bursts are spbs .",
    "of the four short bursts , grb 060121 is the most fascinating .",
    "it is one of only a few short grbs for which strong spectral evolution has been demonstrated .",
    "it is also the first short grb for which it has been possible to obtain a photometric redshift from the optical and nir afterglow of the burst .",
    "the result provides strong evidence that grb 060121 lies at a redshift @xmath9 , and more likely at a redshift @xmath22 , making this the first short burst for which a high redshift has been securely determined .",
    "the properties of grb 060121 , when taken together , provide very strong , but not conclusive , evidence that it is an spb .",
    "if grb 060121 is due to the merger of a compact binary , its high redshift and probable origin in a star - forming disk galaxy argue for a progenitor population that is diverse in terms of merger times and locations .",

    "<S> here we report the localizations and properties of four short - duration grbs localized by the high energy transient explorer 2 satellite ( hete-2 ) : grbs 010326b , 040802 , 051211 and 060121 , all of which were detected by the french gamma telescope ( fregate ) and localized with the wide - field x - ray monitor ( wxm ) and/or soft x - ray camera ( sxc ) instruments . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss ten possible criteria for determining whether these grbs are `` short population bursts '' ( spbs ) or `` long population bursts '' ( lpbs ) . </S>",
    "<S> these criteria are ( 1 ) duration , ( 2 ) pulse widths , ( 3 ) spectral hardness , ( 4 ) spectral lag , ( 5 ) energy @xmath0 radiated in gamma rays ( or equivalently , the kinetic energy @xmath1 of the grb jet ) , ( 6 ) existence of a long , soft bump following the burst , ( 7 ) location of the burst in the host galaxy , ( 8) lack of detection of a supernova component to deep limits , ( 9 ) type of host galaxy and ( 10 ) detection of gravitational waves . in particular , we have developed a likelihood method for determining the probability that a burst is an spb or a lpb on the basis of its @xmath2 duration alone . </S>",
    "<S> a striking feature of the resulting probability distribution is that the @xmath2 duration at which a burst has an equal probability of being a spb or a lpb is @xmath2 = 5 s , _ not _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 = 2 s , which is the criterion that is often used to separate the two populations . </S>",
    "<S> the four short - duration bursts discussed in detail in this paper have @xmath2 durations in the fregate 30 - 400 kev energy band of @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 sec , respectively , yielding probabilities @xmath7 , and @xmath8 that these bursts are spbs on the basis of their @xmath2 durations alone . </S>",
    "<S> all four bursts also have spectral lags consistent with zero . </S>",
    "<S> these results provide strong evidence that all four grbs are spbs .    focusing further on the remarkable properties of grb 060121 , we present the results of a detailed analysis of the light curve and time - resolved spectroscopy of grb 060121 . </S>",
    "<S> the former reveals the presence of a long , soft bump typical of those seen in the light curves of spbs . </S>",
    "<S> this provides additional strong evidence that grb 060121 is an spb . </S>",
    "<S> the latter reveals the existence of dramatic spectral evolution during the burst , making this burst one of only a few spbs for which strong spectral evolution has been demonstrated . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the spectral evolution exhibited by grb 060121 obeys the @xcite relation internally .    </S>",
    "<S> grb 060121 is also the first spb for which it has been possible to obtain a photometric redshift from the optical and nir afterglow of the burst . </S>",
    "<S> the result provides strong evidence that grb 060121 lies at a redshift @xmath9 , and most likely at a redshift @xmath10 , making this the first short burst for which a high redshift has been securely determined . at either redshift , its @xmath11 and @xmath12 values </S>",
    "<S> are consistent with the @xcite relation . however , adopting the jet opening angles derived from modeling of its afterglow the values of @xmath0 are @xmath13 ergs if @xmath14 and @xmath15 ergs if @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> these values are similar to those of the spbs grb 050709 and grb 050724 and @xmath16 times smaller than those of almost all other hard grbs . </S>",
    "<S> they therefore provide additional evidence that grb 060121 is a spb . </S>",
    "<S> hst observations have shown that the probable host galaxy of grb 060121 is irregularly shaped and undergoing star formation . </S>",
    "<S> the location of grb 060121 appears not to be coincident with the strongest star forming regions in the galaxy , which provides additional evidence that it is an spb . </S>",
    "<S> thus , all of the attributes of grb 060121 , when taken together , make a strong , although not conclusive case , that grb 060121 is an spb . </S>",
    "<S> if grb 060121 is due to the merger of a compact binary , its high redshift and probable origin in a star - forming galaxy argue for a progenitor population for spbs that is diverse in terms of merger times and locations . </S>"
