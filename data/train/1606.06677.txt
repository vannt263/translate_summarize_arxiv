    "the precision of the latest observational data from the planck satellite is so high that it excludes several families of well motivated and thoroughly explored inflationary models @xcite .",
    "a prominent example is minimal hybrid inflation .",
    "hybrid inflation was introduced by linde @xcite to employ sub - planckian field values whilst avoiding ` unnaturally ' tiny couplings .",
    "a supergravity ( sugra ) version of the model @xcite has the neat feature that a minimal khler potential @xmath1 , apart from rendering the fields canonically normalised , avoids excessive khler corrections due to an accidental cancellation .",
    "inflationary model - building in sugra suffers from the infamous @xmath0-problem , because the scalar potential is proportional to @xmath2 which results in , where @xmath0 is the second slow - roll parameter and the primes denote derivatives with respect to the inflaton .",
    "for canonical fields so , in general , slow - roll is spoilt .",
    "however , for hybrid inflation with a minimal khler potential a term in the ellipsis cancels @xmath3 and allows during inflation .",
    "it was rather disappointing that the planck observations killed the minimal hybrid model .",
    "this is why many authors put forward modifications , which produce observables within the allowed ranges but at the expense of the above accidental cancellation .",
    "thus , elaborate khler constructions were introduced to ensure slow - roll ( e.g. see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein - but also see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "another proposal is double inflation @xcite , which retains the accidental cancellation mentioned above , and utilises a second period of inflation , such that the number of e - folds of remaining primordial inflation when the cosmological scales exit the horizon is reduced . as a result",
    ", the inflationary observables are affected in a way that renders them compatible with observations . in double inflation , however , the inflationary model is modified to enable the second stage of inflation ( which follows directly after the first stage ) , when the field follows a semi - shifted path in configuration space .",
    "thus , the model is no longer minimal .    in this paper",
    "we propose a mechanism which manages to render the model compatible with observations whilst retaining the neat feature of the accidental cancellation of minimal hybrid inflation in sugra .",
    "in contrast to ref .",
    "@xcite , we do not modify the primordial inflation model .",
    "we simply consider that , after reheating , there is a period of thermal inflation due to some flaton scalar field .",
    "the mechanism operates with any suitable flaton of mass @xmath41  tev . as with double inflation ,",
    "our mechanism dilutes unwanted relics , possibly formed at the end of minimal hybrid inflation in sugra .",
    "we use natural units , for which and , with being the reduced planck mass .",
    "hybrid inflation in sugra is achieved with the superpotential : @xmath5 where the dots denote planck - suppressed non - renormalisable operators , @xmath6 are a pair of singlet lefthanded superfields and @xmath7 is a gauge singlet superfield which acts as the inflaton .",
    "the flatness of the inflationary trajectory is guaranteed by a u(1 ) r - symmetry on @xmath7 .",
    "the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 are made positive with field redefinitions , where is the scale of a grand unified theory ( gut ) and is a dimensionless coupling constant .",
    "the supersymmetric minimum is at and .",
    "we also consider a minimal khler potential for the fields : @xmath10 then the f - term scalar potential is : @xmath11 where the dots denote planck - suppressed terms and we consider that the fields are sub - planckian .    when the d - terms vanish .",
    "since the soft - breaking terms are negligible near the inflation scale ( the gut scale ) , the scalar potential is , where @xmath12 is the coleman - weinberg one - loop radiative correction : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is some renormalisation scale . by suitable rotations in field space we write and , where @xmath15 , @xmath16 are canonically normalised real scalar fields @xcite .    from eq .",
    ", the mass - squared for the waterfall field @xmath16 is @xmath17 hence , when , the field becomes tachyonic .",
    "for the potential is minimised for ( i.e. ) and inflation is driven by the false vacuum density @xmath18 .",
    "inflation ends abruptly at the waterfall when .",
    "then , during inflation , the potential becomes @xmath19 where the second term is subdominant but provides a slope along the inflationary valley , necessary for slow - roll .",
    "one of the advantages of the model is that , by keeping the minimal khler potential , the accidental cancellation still avoids the @xmath0-problem , otherwise endemic in sugra inflation .",
    "the slow - roll parameters are : @xmath20 @xmath21 where the prime denotes derivative with respect to the inflaton @xmath15 . for the spectral index of the density perturbations",
    "we have @xmath22 while the tensor to scalar ratio is given by the consistency condition as . expressing the above in terms of the remaining inflation e - folds @xmath23 , using @xmath24 where",
    ", we find : @xmath25 and @xmath26    examining eqs . and with and gives us and .",
    "whilst @xmath27 is well beneath the planck upper bound , but as yet unobservable , @xmath28 is clearly above the upper 2-@xmath15 bound of the planck observations @xcite .",
    "therefore , the model appears to be excluded . to account for this problem , many authors suggested modifications of the theoretical setup . however , these lost the accidental cancellation that resolved the @xmath0-problem .",
    "consequently , this required the further introduction of complicated versions of the khler potential to keep khler corrections under control . in this paper",
    ", we propose a simpler tactic . by examining eqs .",
    "and we notice that a lower value of @xmath23 can bring @xmath28 within the planck bounds .",
    "furthermore , it may also increase @xmath27 to the point of observability .",
    "we will assume the existence of a so - called flaton field , which can realise thermal inflation .",
    "this is a brief period of inflation lasting up to e - folds , occurring shortly after reheating from primordial inflation .",
    "a bout of thermal inflation occurs from the moment when the scalar potential dominates the thermal bath density , with the field being held on top of a false vacuum , until the moment when a phase transition releases the field from the false vacuum and sends it towards its true vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "therefore , thermal inflation requires a scalar field with a large vev and a flat potential ; such a field is called a flaton  @xcite .",
    "typically , a flaton field corresponds to a supersymmetric flat direction , lifted by a soft mass @xmath41  tev .",
    "now , the number of e - folds before the end of primordial inflation that correspond to the exit of the cosmological scales , @xmath23 , can be reduced by @xmath29 . by investigating the effect of the vev of the thermal flaton on @xmath29 we can determine @xmath23 anew and hence @xmath30 and @xmath31 for inflationary models .",
    "we find that this may render minimal hybrid inflation in sugra viable .",
    "the zero temperature flaton potential and its vev are : @xmath32 ! } \\frac{\\phi^{2(n+2)}}{m_p^{2n}}\\,,%\\!\\ !",
    "\\label{eq : flaton}\\ ] ] @xmath33^{-\\frac{1}{2(n+1 ) } } ( m_p^nm)^{\\frac{1}{n+1}}\\ , , \\label{eq : vev}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is an integer . for a given @xmath35 ,",
    "a large vev is attained with large @xmath36 . when we have .",
    "this case may correspond to a string modulus , whose otherwise flat potential may vary over @xmath37 distances in field space  @xcite .    from the above ,",
    "it is easy to show that the flaton mass - squared is @xmath38 also , because @xmath39 we find : @xmath40 thus , the energy scale of thermal inflation is , .",
    "however , the flaton field interacts strongly with the thermal bath , which introduces an additional , sizeable , term in eq .   of the form , where @xmath41 is the coupling to the thermal bath and",
    "@xmath42 is the temperature  @xcite .",
    "thus , the effective mass - squared is now @xmath43 for high temperatures , @xmath44 is positive and the flaton is driven to zero , where the potential in eq .   is .",
    "thermal inflation begins when @xmath45 overwhelms the density of the thermal bath , , where @xmath46 is the effective relativistic degrees of freedom .",
    "thus , the temperature at the onset of thermal inflation is @xmath47 thermal inflation continues as long as the flaton field is kept on top of the false vacuum by the thermal interaction term .",
    "however , the thermal bath is exponentially depleted , so the temperature drops enough that @xmath44 becomes tachyonic and the flaton is released towards its vev .",
    "this event terminates thermal inflation , and corresponds to the temperature @xmath48 the e - folds of thermal inflation are @xmath49 where we considered @xmath50 . from",
    "the above we see that the flaton vev determines @xmath29 .      before continuing ,",
    "we briefly discuss some particular issues regarding thermal inflation .",
    "first , we consider whether the flaton potential is given by eq .   during inflation as well as in the vacuum .",
    "we also comment on the expectation value of the flaton field during and after inflation .",
    "if the flaton were light ( with sub - hubble mass ) during inflation then it would undergo particle production and develop a non - zero condensate .",
    "after the end of inflation and before reheating , however , while the inflaton field is oscillating , there is a thermal bath with temperature @xcite , which is bigger that the reheating temperature @xmath51 ( @xmath52 being the inflaton perturbative decay rate ) that reduces in time as @xmath53 , while @xmath54 .",
    "the thermal mass of the flaton is @xmath55 ( taking ) , which means that the field becomes heavy ( with super - hubble mass ) and rolls towards zero when the hubble parameter is , i.e. well before reheating , as it is straightforward to  show .    in sugra theories",
    ", however , a scalar field receives a mass of order @xmath56 @xcite , which is the source of the @xmath0-problem .",
    "this means that it is not light during inflation , but rolls to zero well before inflation ends .",
    "the hubble - scale mass becomes negligible before reheating ( when @xmath57 ) and is irrelevant during thermal inflation .",
    "another issue is the following .",
    "one might worry that the coupling of the flaton to the thermal bath , which also couples to the waterfall field , may affect the potential in inflation .",
    "note , however , that the waterfall field is zero during inflation , as most probably is the flaton as well ( due to sugra corrections ) , while the particles of the thermal bath are absent because the latter is inflated away .",
    "thus , we do not expect the potential in inflation to be affected by any non - zero contributions due to the flaton field .",
    "finally , the phase transition which ends thermal inflation can produce unwanted dangerous relics such as domain walls .",
    "one way to circumvent this problem is to gauge the thermal flaton such that the end of thermal inflation produces only harmless local cosmic strings , whose energy scale @xmath58 is too low to have any cosmological significance .",
    "the u(1 ) goldstone boson is eaten by the gauge field , which promptly decays assuming a large mass due to the vev of the flaton .      to find the impact on @xmath23 we need to consider when reheating occurred .",
    "the remaining number of e - folds of primordial inflation when the cosmological scales exit the horizon is @xmath59 where @xmath60mpc@xmath61 is the pivot scale and @xmath62 is the comoving hubble radius today . in the above",
    ", @xmath63 is the energy scale at the end of inflation ( typically the gut scale ) and @xmath64 which is introduced by assuming that , between the end of inflation and reheating , the universe is dominated by the inflaton condensate , that coherently oscillates in a quadratic potential , near its global minimum .",
    "inefficient reheating can lead to low values for @xmath65 . to minimise @xmath23",
    ", we assume the lowest possible reheating temperature . with a subsequent period of thermal inflation ,",
    "the reheating from primordial inflation must have completed before the thermal inflation initiates .",
    "therefore , the minimum @xmath23 is achieved when @xmath66    in view of the above , @xmath23 can be minimized by the combined effect of low reheating and subsequent thermal inflation by the number of e - folds given by @xmath67 \\label{dn}\\ ] ] where we used that in accordance to eq .",
    "( we assumed @xmath68 ) .",
    "eq .   suggests that to minimise @xmath23 we need to reduce both @xmath35 and @xmath36 as much as possible .",
    "we take the value @xmath70tev for the flaton tachyonic mass .",
    "this results in a a mass @xmath71  tev as suggested by eq .   for @xmath72 , which is the lowest allowed by lhc .",
    "table  [ table : finalnvaluesfromorderofmagvev ] shows the results of varying @xmath69 , thereby determining the range of @xmath23 which can be used to calculate @xmath27 and @xmath28 for given inflationary models .    .@xmath29 ,",
    "@xmath73 and @xmath23 with respect to  @xmath69 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     fig .",
    "[ fig : finalgraph ] clearly shows our range of values for @xmath28 inside the parameter space of the planck results , at the 2-@xmath15 level . for large values of the vev ; i.e. more than @xmath74gev or so , @xmath28 enters inside the 1-@xmath15 region .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath75 in eq .",
    ", which , in view of eq .  , suggests that the flaton mass is @xmath76tev , which is safely above the latest lhc bounds .",
    "term is also suppressed for @xmath28 to lie inside the 1-@xmath15 region of the planck data , which amounts to some tuning . ]",
    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated that late reheating followed by a subsequent period of thermal inflation can enable the minimal hybrid inflation in supergravity model to successfully produce cosmological perturbations with spectral index allowed by the planck satellite observations .",
    "we have achieved this without affecting or modifying in the least the inflationary model , retaining thereby the accidental calcellation that resolves the @xmath0-problem of inflation in supergravity with minimal khler potential .",
    "furthermore , we also found that the tensor to scalar ratio can be significantly increased such that it may become observable in the near future .",
    "it is important to stress that the above mechanism may also have profound implications for other inflationary models , see for example ref .",
