    "the first direct observation of the gravitational - wave signal from two coalescing black holes was on september @xmath0 , 2015 @xcite .",
    "it has been confirmed that these compact binaries are the main sources of gravitational waves .",
    "event rate estimates lead to the fact that these systems can be caught a few times a year .",
    "the more precise measurements allow the observation of the finite size effects of individual bodies , such as the masses and spins with high accuracy .",
    "the spin effects of these components can help the understanding of several astrophysical processes e.g. the _ spin - flip phenomenon _ @xcite , the _ frame dragging _ @xcite and the evolution of _ accretion disks _ around black holes @xcite .",
    "the simple lagrangian of the relativistic spinning point particle depends on the acceleration that has been demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "the description of such a systems is not unique in generalized mechanics .",
    "the generalized lagrangian formalism was first developed by jacobi and ostrogradsky @xcite in the 19th century , see reviews @xcite    the description of spinning masses had been studied in general relativity , but the first important result was achieved by mathisson @xcite who described the motion of the extended bodies in general cases , and he also generalized the mechanics of the test bodies in curved backgrounds from @xmath1 . in the early @xmath2s papapetrou found the same equations of motion in ref .",
    "@xcite , but his results came from the noncovariant formalism .",
    "later the equations of the spinning bodies were improved in refs . @xcite and they are called the _ mathisson - papapetrou - tulczyjew - dixon equations_.    it is well - known that this system of equations is not closed , therefore we have to impose some _ spin supplementary conditions _ ( afterwards ssc ) . in the literature basically there are four sscs , namely the _ frenkel - mathisson - pirani _ , the _ newton - wigner - pryce _ , the _ corinaldesi - papapetrou _ and the _ tulczyjew - dixon _ ( see , refs .",
    "@xcite ) ones , which have been studied a lot as a test mass in different curved backgrounds ( see refs.@xcite ) .    the nongeodesic motion of test particles and compact binaries in the _ post - newtonian _ sense ( thereafter pn ) were first developed by barker and oconnell for different sscs in @xcite .",
    "thus the acceleration of the compact binary with leading - order _ spin - orbit interaction _ ( thereafter so ) is not obvious , but it rather depends on the chosen ssc @xcite . some authors have first investigated the spin effects with the help of the pn approach for some of sscs in @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian of compact binaries with so interaction is _ acceleration - dependent _ in two cases of ssc @xcite , but the lagrangian does not depend on acceleration terms for _ newton - wigner - pryce ssc _ in @xcite . taking into account the spins of the bodies in physical systems",

    "we calculate all the conserved quantities and orbital parameters for all sscs . as the main result",
    "we give the classical relative orbital evolution of the spinning binary system . because the lagrangian is acceleration - dependent in two sscs ,",
    "we compute the generalized lagrangian and its canonical dynamics .",
    "we construct the nontrivial type of the ostrogradsky hamiltonian method and then we show two examples for the elimination of acceleration dependent terms from lagrangians , i.e. the constrained dynamics in refs . @xcite and the double zero method proposed by barker and oconnell in ref .",
    "@xcite .    moreover , we consider the dissipative part of the evolution of the compact binary .",
    "we calculate the stf - multipole moments and investigate the instantaneous energy and the orbital angular momentum losses .",
    "it can be seen that these instantaneous losses depend on ssc , but the ssc dependence disappear after averaging over one orbital period .",
    "finally , we compute the gravitational waveforms for all sscs , where it can be seen that the leading - order contribution is independent of ssc , but the next - to - leading - order terms depend on ssc .    our lagrangian ( and hamiltonian ) formalism is consistent with the equations of motion for all sscs in @xcite .",
    "several authors eliminated the covariant ssc at the level of the potential using the dirac bracket method and the variation of the action principle in @xcite .",
    "they first applied the nonreduced so part of the potential and they achieved the reduced hamiltonian form of dynamics , and their result is consistent with one of the barker oconnell type equations of motion if we use the baryonic coordinate transformation ( see ref .",
