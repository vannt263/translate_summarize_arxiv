    "the @xmath10 @xmath11 nuclei are three neutron holes below the @xmath12 closed shell .",
    "their low - lying positive - parity level structure can be interpreted in terms of the spherical shell model as an interplay between proton - particle and neutron - hole excitations in the @xmath13 orbital .",
    "the possible excitations would then be those belonging to the seniority - three configurations : @xmath9 , which can generate spins up to 21/2@xmath6 and @xmath14@xmath15 , terminating at spin 25/2@xmath6 .",
    "the results of g - factor measurements for the lowest 8@xmath6 state in the @xmath16 isotones @xmath17sr @xcite , @xmath18zr and @xmath19mo @xcite indicate that it is essentially built from the alignment of a @xmath13 neutron pair with a small proton admixture which increases with @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , the neutron aligned @xmath21 state would be expected to be yrast in the level structure of @xmath22 isotones .",
    "the high - spin level structure of @xmath23mo ( @xmath24 , @xmath22 ) has been studied by m. weiszflog et al . @xcite .",
    "the shell model interpretation performed with the code ritsschil @xcite and within the @xmath25 model space indicates that the positive - parity states up to 25/2@xmath6 mainly consist of the proton aligned @xmath14@xmath15 configuration .",
    "a particularly interesting case is the one of the 21/2@xmath6 state .",
    "this state can be generated in the neutron fully aligned @xmath9 configuration but the calculations indicate that this component is as small as @xmath26 .",
    "this interpretation has been confirmed by g - factor measurements of the 21/2@xmath6 isomeric state in @xmath23mo , proving the dominance of the @xmath13 proton alignment @xcite .",
    "the trend observed in the @xmath16 isotones and the measurement in @xmath23mo indicate an evolution from neutron to proton alignment , to generate high - spin states in this mass region .",
    "in particular the 21/2@xmath6 states in the @xmath22 isotone @xmath1ru might reveal a complex structure .",
    "understanding the microscopic structure of these levels should therefore shed light on the competition between the possible seniority schemes for the active @xmath13 protons and neutrons .",
    "several groups have already studied the high - spin level structure of @xmath1ru @xcite .",
    "measurements using @xmath27-decay , @xmath0-@xmath0 and @xmath28-@xmath0 coincidences as well as @xmath0-ray anisotropy ratios have been performed and a level scheme proposed .",
    "however , all the spin and parity assignments were based on indirect evidences , systematics or directional correlations of the @xmath0-rays deexciting oriented states ( dco ratios ) with fairly large uncertainties and had to be considered as very tentative .",
    "the proper way to firmly assign a parity to an excited state is to determine the electromagnetic character of the transition deexciting this particular state . to do this",
    ", it is necessary to measure its linear polarization . when combining the polarization information with the angular distribution measurements , the spins and parities of the excited states can be reliably determined . in recent years , due to its high polarization sensitivity and detection efficiency the ge clover detector @xcite has become a useful tool for the measurement of linear polarization by using compton scattering between adjacent crystals .    in the present work we report on the results of linear polarization measurements in @xmath1ru populated in the fusion - evaporation reaction @xmath2ni ( @xmath3ar , @xmath4)@xmath1ru by using the exogam ge clover detector array @xcite . as a result of this work , non yrast ( 21/2@xmath6 ) and ( 17/2@xmath6 ) states",
    "have been observed for the first time and added to the positive - parity structure of @xmath1ru . a theoretical understanding of the structures of the first and second ( 21/2@xmath6 ) and ( 17/2@xmath6 )",
    "levels has been obtained in terms of semi - empirical shell model calculations .",
    "in addition , the polarization sensitivity of the exogam clover detectors , acting as compton polarimeters , have been determined over a wide range of @xmath0-ray energies for the first time .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : a description of the experiment at ganil and the data analysis with a special emphasis on the polarization measurements and the first characterization of exogam as a compton polarimeter will be presented in section ii . in section iii",
    ", we present the results obtained for @xmath1ru while the shell model calculations we performed to understand the microscopic nature of the high - spin states in this nucleus will be discussed in section iv .",
    "excited states in @xmath1ru have been investigated using the fusion - evaporation reaction @xmath2ni(@xmath3ar , @xmath4 ) at a beam energy of 111 mev and with an average intensity of 10 pna .",
    "the beam was provided by the cime cyclotron of ganil , caen , france .",
    "the isotopically enriched ( 99.83% ) @xmath2ni targets used in the reactions had an average thickness of 6.0 mg/@xmath29 , enough to stop the recoiling nuclei .",
    "the @xmath0-rays from the reaction products were detected by the exogam ge clover detector array @xcite , consisting of 11 clover - type ge detectors for this experiment , 7 at an angle of 90@xmath30 and 4 at 135@xmath30 relative to the beam direction .",
    "neutrons evaporated from the compound nuclei were detected using the neutron wall array @xcite composed of 50 organic liquid - scintillator elements , covering the forward 1@xmath31 section of the solid angle around the target position .",
    "the light charged particles ( mainly protons and alphas ) were detected by the diamant detector system consisting of 80 csi scintillators @xcite .",
    "details of the experiment have been described earlier @xcite .",
    "events were collected when at least one neutron was detected by the neutron wall and one @xmath0-ray registered in coincidence in the clover detectors . with these trigger conditions a total of 4 @xmath32 10@xmath33 events were recorded .    in the off - line processing ,",
    "coincidence data were sorted into symmetric @xmath0-@xmath0 matrices with different conditions on the number of detected neutrons and charged particles .",
    "these conditions were used to assign new @xmath0-rays to @xmath1ru .",
    "coincidence @xmath0-ray spectra were then obtained by setting gates in these matrices .",
    "examples of coincidence spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] .",
    "[ fig01](a ) is the total projection of a @xmath0-@xmath0 matrix obtained in coincidence with the detection of two protons and one neutron .",
    "this spectrum is dominated by @xmath0-rays from @xmath1ru with some peaks belonging to @xmath34cr produced in the @xmath35o(@xmath3ar,@xmath4 ) reaction , i.e. in the same reaction channel .",
    "this contamination is removed by setting an additional selection of known @xmath0-rays in @xmath1ru .",
    "[ fig01](b ) shows the spectrum obtained after gating on the 974 kev transition previously known as deexciting the first excited state to the ground state in @xmath1ru .",
    "this spectrum contains only known transitions belonging to @xmath1ru with some additional , unknown @xmath0-rays .",
    "further gating on these new transitions has allowed us to confirm their assignment to @xmath1ru and to position them into the level scheme .",
    "this is what is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig01](c ) which gives a spectrum gated on the new 436 kev transition of @xmath1ru .",
    "finally , with the large statistics obtained during this experiment it is possible to perform a more detailed analysis of the observed transitions .",
    "the geometry of the exogam array allowed the assignments of spins from the information on dco ratios @xcite .",
    "for this purpose , an asymmetric particle - gated matrix was constructed in which @xmath0 events recorded at 90@xmath36 were sorted against those recorded at 135@xmath36 .",
    "the experimental dco ratios ( @xmath37 ) were deduced from pairs of gated spectra according to equation @xmath38        the detection efficiencies of detectors at 90@xmath36 and at 135@xmath36 have the same behaviour with @xmath0-ray energy .",
    "therefore their ratio @xmath39 is a constant ( @xmath40 ) hence no efficiency correction of the dco ratios was needed .",
    "[ fig02 ] shows two projected spectra obtained from the dco matrix .",
    "the spectrum in the upper ( lower ) panel corresponds to @xmath0-rays detected at 135@xmath36 ( 90@xmath36 ) and in coincidence with the 497 kev @xmath41 transition in @xmath1ru observed at 90@xmath36 ( 135@xmath36 ) .",
    "the ratio of the peak intensities in these two spectra provides the @xmath37 values of the @xmath0-rays .",
    "for example , the three most intense transitions in both projected spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] are the 616 , 898 and 974 kev @xmath0-rays .",
    "their intensities in the two spectra are [ 2414(62 ) , 6879(90 ) , 6731(88 ) ] and [ 4821(80 ) , 7134(92 ) , 7062(90 ) ] , respectively .",
    "the deduced dco ratios for these transitions are then [ 0.50(2 ) , 0.96(2 ) , 0.95(2 ) ] .",
    "the dco ratios measured for @xmath0-rays in @xmath1ru and also in @xmath1tc produced in the @xmath42 channel are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] .",
    "the @xmath37 value for known stretched quadrupole transitions is @xmath43 and is @xmath44 for known pure stretched dipoles , when gating on quadrupole transitions .",
    "if the gate is set on a pure stretched dipole transition , then the @xmath37 value for known quadrupole transitions is @xmath45 and is @xmath43 for known pure stretched dipoles .",
    "based on these assignment criteria , the @xmath37 values obtained in the above example suggest that the 616 kev transition is a @xmath46 dipole transition whereas the 898 and 974 kev transitions have a @xmath47 quadrupole character .",
    "these assignments are consistent with the previous assignments @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that for mixed @xmath48 transitions @xmath37 ratios can vary between 0.6 and 1.0 depending on the @xmath49 multipole mixing ratio of the @xmath0-ray .",
    "a further ambiguity arises for non - stretched ( @xmath50 ) pure @xmath51 ( or @xmath52 ) transitions , where @xmath37 for non - stretched dipole transition with @xmath53 mixing ratio is approximately the same as for a stretched quadrupole transition @xcite .",
    "these ambiguities can be resolved by simultaneously measuring the linear polarization of the @xmath0-ray transitions ( see below ) .",
    "for example , stretched @xmath51 , @xmath54 or unstretched @xmath52 transitions and stretched @xmath52 or unstretched @xmath51 transitions have opposite sign linear polarization values @xcite .        in order to determine the multipolarity and the electromagnetic nature of a transition",
    ", both the dco ratio and the linear polarization should be measured .",
    "one of the unique capabilities of the exogam array is the possibility to use the clover detectors as compton polarimeters . in the following",
    ", the measurement of the performances of exogam as compton polarimeter will be described .",
    "the clover detectors placed at 90@xmath30 relative to the beam axis were used to determine the linear polarization of @xmath0-ray transitions , since they are the most sensitive to the polarization @xcite .",
    "we define the emission plane by the direction of the initial @xmath0-ray and the beam axis .",
    "the clover detector is composed of four hpge crystals closely packed in the same cryostat . in compton scattering",
    ", the initial and scattered @xmath0-rays can be detected in adjacent crystals of the same detector and analyzed separately according to whether the scattering has occurred horizontally to the emission plane or vertically to it .",
    "two @xmath0-@xmath0 matrices were created as follows : the first @xmath0-ray corresponds to a single - crystal hit in any clover detector of the array and the second one to the sum of the energy deposited in two crystals within the same clover located at 90@xmath30 ( i.e. the addback energy of events scattering between two adjacent crystals of a clover , this one being positioned at 90@xmath30 ) .",
    "the matrices contain therefore events with either horizontally or vertically scattered @xmath0-rays in a clover at 90@xmath30 on one axis and a single - crystal hit on any of the clover detectors on the other axis .",
    "the number of horizontal ( @xmath55 ) and vertical ( @xmath56 ) scatters for a given @xmath0-ray could be obtained by setting gates on @xmath0-ray transitions in the two asymmetric matrices .",
    "the experimental polarization asymmetry is defined by the ratio @xmath57 , @xmath58-n_{\\|}}{\\left[a\\left(\\rm e_{\\gamma}\\right)n_{\\bot}\\right]+n_{\\|}},\\label{eq2}\\ ] ] where @xmath59(e@xmath60 ) is the normalization factor corresponding to the asymmetry of the exogam clover detectors , and is defined as @xmath61 the normalization factor is a function of @xmath0-ray energy and has been obtained from the measurement with a standard @xmath62eu radioactive source .",
    "[ fig04 ] shows the variation of @xmath59 with energy e@xmath60 .",
    "it was fitted with the expression @xmath63 , resulting in @xmath64 and @xmath65 , where e@xmath60 is in kev . as is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig04 ] , the value of @xmath59 is almost constant and close to unity , showing nearly ideal symmetry of the four - crystal clover detector acting as the compton polarimeter .",
    "the polarization asymmetry @xmath57 is negative for unmixed stretched magnetic transitions and positive for stretched electric transitions .",
    "it is proportional to the degree of linear polarization @xmath66 , @xmath67 where the quality factor @xmath68 is the polarization sensitivity of the polarimeter . @xmath69 and @xmath70 would indicate completely insensitive and completely sensitive polarimeters , respectively . for a point - like polarimeter",
    ", the polarization sensitivity @xmath68 can be calculated from the klein - nishina formula @xcite , which gives @xmath71 where m@xmath72 is the electron rest mass . for a realistic setup of detectors with finite crystal size",
    ", we have to integrate over a certain range of scattering angles leading to a considerable reduction of the polarization sensitivity .",
    "the effective polarization sensitivity is usually given as @xmath73 according to eqs.([eq4])-([eq6 ] ) , @xmath68 and the two parameters @xmath74 and @xmath75 can be experimentally determined using @xmath0-rays whose linear polarization is well known .",
    "theoretical values of the linear polarization can be deduced from the angular distribution . for @xmath0-rays detected at 90@xmath36 with respect to the beam direction , the polarization of pure electric quadrupole transitions can be calculated from the formula @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the normalized ( @xmath79 ) coefficients of the legendre polynomials in the angular distribution .",
    "to determine the capability of the exogam array to measure linear polarization , we analyzed the angular distribution for the known pure @xmath54 transitions in the energy range 316 to 1264 kev in the level schemes of @xmath1ru @xcite , @xmath1tc @xcite , @xmath19mo @xcite , and @xmath18mo @xcite .",
    "the angular distribution coefficients , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , for each transition , were extracted from least squares fits of the photopeak areas and summarized in table [ tab01 ] .",
    "the deduced values of the linear polarization @xmath66 and the experimental asymmetry ratio @xmath57 for the known @xmath0-ray transitions are also summarized in table [ tab01 ] , along with the polarization sensitivity @xmath68 of the exogam array .",
    "the experimental values of @xmath68 , together with the results of the fit to the data , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig05 ] .",
    "the coefficients @xmath74 and @xmath75 were determined by a least squares fit to the values of @xmath68 using the function of eq.([eq6 ] ) ; @xmath80 , @xmath81 .",
    "the quality of a polarimeter depends on both its sensitivity to the polarization and the coincidence efficiency between the scatterer and absorber crystals expressed as @xcite @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the total number of counts and the photopeak efficiency of the clover considered as a single detector at the energy @xmath85 , measured when the @xmath0-ray has no polarization ( i.e. using a source or when the detector is at @xmath86 with respect to the beam direction ) .",
    "finally it is common to compare polarimeters using a figure of merit defined as @xcite @xmath87 the figure of merit deduced for the exogam clover at 1368 kev is 1.51 @xmath88 which is 4.4 times larger that the one measured for the smaller eurogam clover @xcite . at the same @xmath0-ray energy , the measured polarization sensitivity @xmath89 is 0.135(5 ) ( 0.121(5 ) for the eurogam clover ) which means that the increase is due to the much larger coincidence efficiency .",
    "this increase in efficiency makes exogam an ideal polarimeter for low - intensity @xmath0-rays ."
