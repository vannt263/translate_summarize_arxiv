    "the study of the evolution of galaxy clustering with redshift can allow us to provide further tests to galaxy formation models by probing the evolution of the amplitude of fluctuations in the quasi - linear to non - linear regime , which only recently is becoming better understood by means of large numerical simulations ( colberg et al .",
    "2000 ; sheth , mo & tormen , 2001 ; padilla & baugh , 2002 ; slejak & warren , 2004 ) . on the other hand , studies on the evolution of clustering will also allow to probe the evolution of the relation between galaxies and the underlying dark matter , which is often parametrised by the bias parameter ( e.g. coil et al .",

    "it is now becoming possible to perform deep galaxy redshift surveys , such as the deep2 galaxy redshift survey ( coil et al . ,",
    "2004 ) , the vimos vlt deep survey ( vvds , le fvre et al . 2005 ) , and the zcosmos redshift survey ( meneux et al . , 2009 ) which allow the study of the evolution of clustering with redshift .",

    "( 2005 ) using @xmath20 vvds galaxies , and meneux et al .",
    "( 2009 ) using a similar number of zcosmos galaxies .",
    "these studies , however , only reach redshifts of about @xmath21 , mainly due to the selection of galaxies by setting a lower limit on the photometric flux , which preferentially selects galaxies at relatively moderate redshifts , and are affected by cosmic variance due to the relatively small surveyed volumes .",
    "there are several techniques that take advantage of features in the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) to identify sets of galaxies at a particular redshift range .",
    "these techniques use the lyman break in the sed at @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( ouchi et al .",

    "respectively ) , with the h@xmath24 line in emission ( e.g. sobral et al . , 2010 ) , or use faint sources selected in the k - band ( e.g. quadri et al . , 2007",
    "measurements of clustering from such samples , however , are somewhat hindered by the relatively low numbers of galaxies .",
    "a recent measurement of the clustering of galaxies selected using the lyman@xmath26 emission ( lae galaxies ) technique was performed by gawiser et al .",
    "they point out that different samples of galaxies at high redshift , such as lyman break galaxies and laes trace different underlying galaxy populations that can be related via their clustering measurements with the aid of a theoretical framework .",
    "gawiser et al .",
    "first provide a thorough comparison between different available clustering measurements from @xmath17 to @xmath27 , and then analyse whether samples at different redshifts can be considered to be related in a parent / descendant relationship ( see also quadri et al .",
    ", 2007 , francke et al . , 2008 , guaita et al . , 2010 ) .",
    "the latter is achieved by comparing their measured clustering with expected trends of the bias parameter with redshift extracted from simple analytic approximations in a @xmath3cdm model .",
    "this allows them to connect the lae population at @xmath28 to present - day @xmath29 galaxies .",
    "another interesting approach is that presented by zheng , coil & zehavi ( 2007 , see also white et al .",
    ", 2007 , brown et al",

    "an interesting prospect is that of putting together theoretical models for the evolution of haloes with hods and applying the analysis to large sets of measurements of high - z galaxies .    within this picture , intermediate redshift surveys such as deep2 and vvds , which cover the range @xmath32 , bridge the gap between the low redshift surveys such as sdss and 2dfgrs , and the samples of laes , lbgs and other photometrically selected galaxies at high redshifts . in this paper we will analyse the clustering of volume limited samples of musyc galaxies , to complement this intermediate redshift range , studying galaxy populations of various luminosities and redshifts out to @xmath33 .",
    "the detailed evolution of the galaxy clustering can also be used to study the assembly of passive galaxies .",
    "this particular subject has recently become the centrepoint of a discussion regarding galaxy evolution .",
    "it has been claimed that high stellar mass , passive galaxies do not show an evolution in their comoving space density .",
    "this has been studied using the stellar mass and luminosity functions in observations ( cimatti et al . , 2002 , 2004 ; mccarthy et al . , 2004 ; glazebrook et al . 2004 ; daddi et al . , 2005 ; saracco et al . , 2005 ; prez - gonzlez et al .",
    ", 2008 ; bundy et al . , 2006 ) , and has been interpreted as evidence that their stellar content has already been assembled at high redshift , ruling out the involvement of ( even dry ) mergers in the build up of their stellar mass .",

    "the templates in the synthetic set adopted by hyperz ( bolzonella , miralles & pell , 2000 ) , allowed to evolve with time , are used to represent the redshift / spectral type mix in musyc .",
    "once a photometric redshift and a best fitting evolving template are assigned to a galaxy , the latter is compared to a collection of @xmath50 templates selected as in christlein et al .",
    "the christlein et al .",
    "templates correspond to different @xmath17 galaxy morphologies from early types ( e , e@xmath16sbc ) to late type irr galaxies , and allow us to define a galaxy morphology from the best fitting evolving template .",
    "when calculating the redshift probabilities , we used all available musyc flux measurements from all the available bands .",
    "as can be seen in the top - left panel of figure [ fig : zphoto ] , the resulting photometric redshifts out to @xmath51 agree to roughly @xmath52 with the spectroscopic redshifts .",

    "the lack of severe degeneracies is also clear in our photo - z estimates .",

    "the remotion of outliers diminishes the sample of ecdf - s galaxies by a @xmath56 .",
    "we do not use galaxies fainter than @xmath57 since at these apparent magnitudes the quality of the photometric redshift estimation starts to degrade .",
    "the dots in the figure represent each galaxy in the ecdf - s down to this magnitude limit . for ehdf - s the total number of spectroscopic redshifts available amounts to @xmath58 ( much less than for ecdf - s ) .",
    "the comparison between spectroscopic and photometric redshifts shows that photo - z errors are consistent with those for ecdf - s , even when there is no near - infrared photometry for this field .",
    "the remotion of the @xmath55 outliers diminishes the ehdf - s sample by a @xmath59 .",
    "as will be shown in section 3 , the analysis of mock catalogues with the photometry available in the ehdf - s and ecdf - s suggests that the photo - z errors in the former will be up to a factor @xmath60 higher ( see the inset in the lower - right panel of the figure ) , as a result of the lack of infra - red photometry in this field .",
    "this also increases the amount of catastrophic errors in ehdf - s ; the mock catalogues will allow us to assess the degree out to which this will affect the ehdf - s results .",
    "the upper and middle panels of figure [ fig : rmag ] show the comparison between the rest - frame r - band absolute magnitudes ( @xmath61 ) estimated using the spectroscopic and photometric redshifts of each galaxy , for the ehdf - s and ecdf - s fields , for two different redshift slices ( indicated in each panel ) . in all cases ,",
    "the photo - z estimates of @xmath61 show offsets of up to @xmath62 magnitude from the spectroscopic ones . in the case of ehdf - s , at @xmath63 , this difference may be higher , of up to @xmath64 mags , but the low number of spectroscopic redshifts available does not allow to reach a firm conclusion on this regard ; however , the analysis of mock catalogues will confirm that the recovery of @xmath61 is expected to be significantly better in ecdf - s ( see the lower panel ) .    in our clustering measurements we will use two types of galaxy samples .",
    "centre samples around which the clustering will be measured , and tracer samples that will be used to trace the structure around each centre galaxy .",
    "we restrict centre galaxies to the redshift range @xmath65 and divide the data in four  centre \" subsamples , defined by photo - z ranges limited by @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 ; these limits are set so as to probe a wide redshift range .",

    "the aim in dividing the sample in different bins of redshift is to be able to detect a variation in the clustering of galaxies with redshift .",
    "additionally , we apply rest - frame r - band absolute magnitude cuts to construct volume limited samples ; these are illustrated by the solid lines in figure [ fig : hd ] .",
    "since we will use a cross - correlation technique , we define samples of tracer galaxies , which are galaxies selected using the same absolute magnitude cuts , but allowing a further @xmath78 to each side of the corresponding redshift interval ( with the restriction of maximum redshift @xmath33 ) .",
    "this has the advantage of improving the statistical signal while only inducing small correlations between results from different redshift slices since the centre samples do not overlap ( we do expect correlations arising from the photo - z errors which will contaminate neighbour redshift bins , and also from fluctuations of large - scale modes straddling the centre samples ) .",
    "we also construct samples of early - type galaxies with similar passively evolved luminosities . in order to select etgs",
    ", we find the @xmath17 template that best matches the evolving template that was originally fit to the galaxy in the photo - z calculation .",
    "this effectively selects etgs with similar colours at different redshifts . in order to select similar passively evolved luminosities",

    "2006 ) for the b - band , where @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the absolute magnitude of a galaxy passively evolved to @xmath17 ; at redshift @xmath38 the galaxy has a rest - frame absolute magnitude @xmath81 .",
    "this recipe is derived empirically from the evolution of the fundamental plane for massive early - type galaxies ( di serego alighieri et al . , 2005 ) . as our samples are characterised by r - band magnitudes we find the corresponding evolution recipe in the r - band using models for the spectra of early - type galaxies ( etgs ) approximated by single stellar populations ( ssp ) .",
    "we first look for the ssp that best matches the evolution recipe from eq .",

    "we find that a ssp which at @xmath21 is @xmath83gyr old provides the best match to the recipe of eq .",
    "[ evob ] ( consistent with studies by bell et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "this can be seen in figure [ fig : evo ] which shows the evolution of the b - band magnitude for this sed along with the recipe from eq .",
    "the figure also shows the evolution of the r - band magnitude for the same seds along with the best fit to the r - band evolution which corresponds to @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the rest - frame luminosity at redshift @xmath38 .",
    "we use the relation from eq .",
    "[ evor ] to construct samples with comparable evolved @xmath17 r - band luminosities delimited by @xmath86 , and @xmath87 .",
    "we notice that the evolution recipe adopted here is particularly adequate for massive etgs ( di serego alighieri et al . , 2005 ) ; even though we apply it to faint galaxies as well , we will only make comparisons between different redshift bins for the brightest samples .",
    "we apply the same redshift cuts used in the construction of the volume limited samples ( see above ) .",
    "the resulting samples are illustrated in figure [ fig : hd ] by the dashed lines ( the vertical lines have been slightly displaced to improve clarity ) ; the dependence of @xmath61 on redshift shown by these lines correspond to the evolution of the etg sed from eq .",
    "[ evor ] , and as can be seen , the etg samples selected this way should be complete since the dependence of the selection effect is stronger than the modeled passive evolution .",
    "given that the detection of sources is done using optical filters ( b , v and r ) , it could be possible that this will act against a complete selection of etgs as proposed here .",
    "however , the detection limit in the combined optical photometry is @xmath88 magnitudes deeper in flux than the sample selection cut .",
    "still , in order to check whether this is affecting our results , we will also use the available imaging in the @xmath89 band to produce an alternative sample of etgs for the ecdf - s ( this is not available for ehdf - s ) ; the equivalent magnitude limit that produces a sample of etgs comparable the one obtained in the r - band is @xmath90 .",
    "( 250,127 ) ( 5,-15 )     we note that our samples of etgs will consist of read - and - dead galaxies at all the redshift intervals chosen .",
    "as we will show in section 6 , our approach is consistent with selecting galaxies in the red branch of the bimodal colour distribution , that is , in the red sequence .",
    "the latter has been widely used to study etg properties and clustering evolution , as in bell et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , faber et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , and coil et al .",
    "another possibility for the selection of etg samples in a direct descendant line at different redshifts is to let the colour of the galaxy templates evolve , but in this case we find that the selected galaxies either include blue cloud objects in our higher redshift samples or too few objects at low redshifts , mainly due to the small solid angle of the musyc survey .",
    "this can be taken as a possible indication that the samples of etgs constructed by selecting galaxies in the red sequence with similar @xmath17 passively evolved luminosities , may not constitute the parents and descendants of one another .",
    "however , small amounts of star - formation could easily change the colours of etgs , making this comparison difficult . in order to overcome this problem , from this point on we will only analise the possible parent / descendant relationship between etg musyc samples at a given redshift and sdss etg samples at @xmath17 .",
    "as over the individual redshift ranges probed by our analysis the change in clustering amplitude is expected to be roughly linear with redshift , our clustering measurements will be quoted at the median redshift of the galaxy subsample .",
    "due to the large uncertainties in the determination of photometric redshifts it is necessary to assess the effects arising from possible sources of systematics in our procedure . in order to do this ,",
    "we use two mock catalogues extracted from a @xmath3cdm numerical simulation populated with galform ( versions corresponding to baugh et al . , 2005 , and bower et al . , 2006",
    ") semi - analytic galaxies , kindly provided by the durham group . as the underlying clustering and its evolution in the simulation are known , the results from the mock catalogues can be used to find systematic biases in our estimates , and to devise a method to account for them using only data available in the observational sample .",
    "the clustering of galaxies in the simulation mimics reasonably well the clustering of real galaxies , which makes the use of these mocks appropriate to test our method .",
    "we construct two of mock catalogues , one of them using a single @xmath17 simulation output ( and therefore with a constant clustering with redshift ) with baugh et al .",
    "( 2005 ) galaxies .",
    "the other mock is constructed using simulation outputs at different redshifts ( i.e. an evolving lightcone ) containing bower et al .",

    "the ability of our measurement method to detect these variations will allow a study of the reliability of any clustering dependence on luminosity and redshift found in the real data .",
    "there are a total of @xmath91 particles in this simulation , the box side measures @xmath92h@xmath8mpc a side , the matter density parameter corresponds to @xmath93 , the value of the dark energy density parameter is @xmath94 , the hubble constant , @xmath95kms@xmath8mpc@xmath8 , with @xmath96 , and the primordial power spectrum slope , @xmath97 .",
    "the present day amplitude of fluctuations in spheres of @xmath98h@xmath8mpc is set to @xmath99 .",

    "spergel et al .",
    "2007 , snchez et al . , 2006 ) .",
    "we have adopted this cosmology for all the calculations performed throughout this paper .",
    "the mock catalogues are constructed by selecting a suitable direction in the simulation cube and following it out to @xmath100 replicating the simulation as many times as needed ( @xmath101 in total , including outputs at different redshifts in the bower et al .",
    "the direction is selected such that the structures sampled by the cone are not repeated .",
    "the estimates of uncertainties will be obtained using the jacknife technique applied to each mock field individually .",
    "this technique has been shown to provide uncertainties comparable to the scatter in clustering results from large numbers of individual mock catalogues ( see for instance , padilla et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "the process of assigning galaxies to the mock catalogues consists of checking that the angular position of the galaxy falls within the musyc angular mask , and by placing the same apparent and absolute magnitude limit cuts as in the musyc data defined in section [ sec : data ] .",
    "these magnitude limit cuts imprint a radial selection function in the mock catalogues which is qualitatively similar to that of the real data ( obtained using photo - zs ) .",
    "we apply the least squares frequentist best - fit method to assign photometric redshifts to mock galaxies , replicating the process followed for the observational data as well as the available photometry ( i.e. different mocks for ehdf - s and ecdf - s galaxies ) . a comparison between underlying ( spectroscopic ) and photometrically derived redshifts for a bower et al . ecdf - s mock is shown in the right panels of figure [ fig : zphoto ] ; the lower right panel shows that the photo - z redshift uncertainties are comparable to those present in the real data ( left panels ) .",
    "additionally , the top - right panel shows a similar pattern as the musyc galaxies , with structures in the scatter plot situated at particular values of spectroscopic redshift reflecting the large - scale structure , and at certain values of photometric redshift due to attractors in the photometric fitting solution .",
    "this comparison further ensures us we have a proper tool to determine the statistical and systematic errors in the measured clustering amplitude arising from realistic photo - z errors .",
    "we calculate the photo - z errors for a bower et al .",
    "ehdf - s mock , and perform the ratio between these errors and those obtained for the ecdf - s mock .",
    "this ratio is shown in the inset of the lower - right panel of figure [ fig : zphoto ] where it can be seen that the lack of near infrared data in ehdf - s results in photo - z errors of up to a factor @xmath60 larger than in the ecdf - s mock .     using the mocks",
    ", we also test whether the adopted template set allows us to recover the true rest - frame absolute magnitude in the r - band from the available photometry . to do this we apply the template fitting procedure fixing the redshift at its spectroscopic ( true ) value .",
    "the comparison indicates that for the ecdf - s photometry the recovery is very precise , with systematic offsets lower than @xmath102 magnitudes .",
    "the ehdf - s shows a good recovery for galaxies of all luminosities at @xmath103 ; at higher redshifts this is true only for faint galaxies with @xmath104 .",
    "brighter galaxies show inferred magnitudes systematically brighter by @xmath105 mags , as can be seen in the example shown in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : rmag ] .",
    "such an offset was expected to some degree since the available photometry in ehdf - s , ubvriz , only allows to obtain an extrapolated rest - frame r - band magnitude at redshifts @xmath106 .",
    "we will bear in mind this possible systematic offset when analysing the ehdf - s results at this redshift range .",
    "our aim is to obtain a reliable measurement of the real - space correlation length @xmath5 , the separation at which the 3d spatial correlation function satisfies @xmath107 . in the following description",
    "we will use the term  redshift \" to refer to photo - zs in the case of musyc data , and to refer to either photometric or spectroscopic redshifts in the case of the mock catalogues ( in this case , spectroscopic redshifts correspond to the true galaxy redshifts ) ; when analysing the latter , spectroscopic redshifts will be used to infer the true underlying clustering present in the mock samples .",

    "when calculating this correlation function one assumes that all tracers ( usually with no distance information ) lie at the known distance of the centre galaxy , given by its redshift ( spectroscopic or photometric ) . in our case",
    "this approach keeps the effect of distance measurement errors to a minimum by only using photometric redshifts to estimate comoving distances to the centre galaxies , and to restrict the range of redshifts of tracers ( i.e. we never calculate the relative distance between galaxies in the radial direction ) ; this is the main aim behind the choice of this cross - correlation function .",

    "these values are consistent within the errorbars with previous estimates from the vvds survey ( le fvre et al .",
    "2005 ) and deep2 ( coil et al . , 2004 ) for samples with similar intrinsic luminosities . by extension",
    ", these measurements would also be consistent with the results for the zcosmos survey by meneux et al .",
    "( 2009 ) who obtain similar results to the vvds ; a more direct comparison with our measurements would involve replicating their sample selection which we do not attempt at this time .",
    "we also studied the clustering properties of early type galaxies with similar evolved intrinsic luminosities ( using a passive evolution recipe ) , finding good agreement with a previous measurement of equivalent samples of red galaxies by coil et al .",
    "( 2008 ) at @xmath184 .",
    "samples selected this way at different redshifts have been proposed as tools to study the evolution of the stellar content of early type galaxies with redshift , to infer the typical epoch of assembly .",
    "we find indications that such samples may not constitute a single evolving population ; furthermore , our results indicate that @xmath203 early type galaxies evolve into present - day objects with a higher clustering than their counterparts of similar evolved luminosity at lower redshifts .",
    "our results have suffered from considerable cosmic variance ( similar to the effects suffered by deep2 and vvds ) , an issue that will soon be overcome by larger surveys . in particular , the method presented in this paper will be extremely useful to analyse upcoming or planned photometric surveys which will cover areas many orders of magnitude larger than musyc .",
    "examples are the dark energy survey ( @xmath204sq .",
    "degrees , huan et al . , 2009 ) , or the large synoptic survey telescope ( @xmath205 sq",
    ". degrees , ivezic et al . ,",
    "2008 ) which , while characterised by photometric redshift errors comparable to those from musyc , will allow extremely accurate measurements of the clustering dependence on redshift , luminosity and template type , and in turn on the parent - descendant relation between samples of galaxies at different redshifts .",
