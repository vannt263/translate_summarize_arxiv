    "bekenstein - hawking entropy @xmath0 has been derived from different points of view @xcite .",
    "but if it is considered thermal with a microscopic description , according to the statistical foundations of entropy , perhaps the most promising and appropriate formalism to explain @xmath0 is the entanglement entropy approach @xcite .",
    "in particular , entanglement entropy of black shells is required , because the usual thermal entropies for black holes are divergent and geometric in nature @xcite .    in the first part of this paper",
    "we complete the concept of black shell presented in @xcite .",
    "thus , by simplicity we effectively model the significant features of the gravitational collapse , in terms of a massive thin spherical collapsing shell with respect to an external observer .    in the second part of the text we consider euclidean approach for entropy of black shells , thinking in its complementary description of entanglement entropy .",
    "thermal entropy or entanglement entropy modeled by a black shell is a real physical model for @xmath0 , because it corresponds to the thermodynamics of hot quantum fields confined near the outside of the shell @xcite . unlike black holes that do nt have structure and require a picture of quantum gravity to describe its geometrical entropy as some unknown physics , black shells have structure and thermal physical entropy .",
    "we show below that entropy calculated from gibbons - hawking euclidean approach for spherical black shells , retrieving the horizon integral and discarding boundary at infinity , preserves the same expression for bekenstein - hawking entropy : @xmath1    so entanglement entropy for black shells according to an external observer do not need to consider quantum gravity criteria to explain @xmath0 .    in the last part of the paper we complete the model by describing complementary quantum details .    in sec .",
    "2 we present the black shell model and review the darmois - israel formalism @xcite that is needed in order to obtain the motion equations of this model that we solve in sec .",
    "3 . in sec .",
    "4 we reproduce the well known bekenstein - hawking entropy from euclidean approach for a schwarzschild black hole @xcite . in sec . 5",
    "we retrieve the horizon integral and discard boundary at infinity in order to calculate the entropy of a black shell . there",
    "we introduce a mathematical identity to support our two complementary descriptions of physics near an event horizon . in sec .",
    "6 , for completeness , we return to entanglement entropy of black shells .",
    "so , we reproduce some results from @xcite and complete details of the corresponding hamiltonian formulation .",
    "7 is devoted to discuss some conclusions about this paper .",
    "we present in this section a model where a black hole is formed by a thin contracting shell of dust of mass @xmath2 that contracts beginning from infinity and at last tends to the schwarzschild radius from the point of view of an external observer far from the shell in a gravitational collapse evolution of oppenheimersnyder kind @xcite , as we see in section 3 .",
    "+ in this context we employ the darmois - israel formalism @xcite for a spherical thin shell @xmath3 which divides the spacetime in two regions : the interior region @xmath4 , described by flat minkowskian geometry and @xmath5 , the exterior geometry described by schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "both regions are described by spherical coordinates : @xmath6 , and we use geometric units in which : @xmath7 , and signature : @xmath8 .",
    "then the line element is :    @xmath9    where : @xmath10 for @xmath5 and @xmath11 for @xmath4 .",
    "the shell hypersurface @xmath12 is represented in the chosen frame by the following parametric equation :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the thin shell radius .",
    "the following intrinsic coordinates on the shell are used : + @xmath15 , and the 3-metric elements induced in the hypersurface are :    @xmath16    we note that the relation between coordinates of @xmath17 and intrinsic coordinates on @xmath3 are :    @xmath18    and the parametric equation for @xmath12 adopts the following general form :    @xmath19    we assume that @xmath12 is non - null and the unit 4-normals to @xmath12 in @xmath20 are :    @xmath21    the extrinsic curvature ( seccond fundamental form ) is defined by :    @xmath22    using ( [ bs1 ] ) and ( [ f2 ] ) the normal ( [ f6 ] ) is :    @xmath23    with the usual formula for the covariant derivative equations ( [ f4 ] ) and ( [ f7 ] ) yields the simple relation :    @xmath24    raising indexes and considering that schwarzschild metric is diagonal , we arrive to the simple results :    @xmath25=\\frac{1}{2}f^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\partial_{r}f,\\ ] ]    @xmath26=\\left[k_{\\varphi}^{\\varphi}\\right]=\\frac{1}{r}f^{\\frac{1}{2}}-\\frac{1}{r},\\ ] ]    @xmath27=f^{-\\frac{1}{2}}(\\frac{1}{2}\\partial_{r}f+\\frac{2}{r}f - f^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\frac{2}{r}).\\ ] ]    where square brackets denotes a discontinuity across the layer , i.e. , @xmath28=f^{+}-f^{-}$ ] .",
    "our following task is to perform the calculations to obtain the motion equations of the shell and the bekenstein - hawking entropy of the shell .",
    "this is developed in sections 3 and 5 .",
    "in this section we review the thin shells junction formalism @xcite , in order to study the motion of a spherical shell of dust that contracts beginning at rest from infinity as seen by a distant observer whose proper time is the schwarzschild time @xmath29 .    for this purpose",
    "we consider the surface energy tensor of a shell of dust :    @xmath30    with the condition : @xmath31 and where @xmath32 is the rest mass surface density of the dust .",
    "if we consider a trajectory @xmath33 of an element of rest mass on the shell , then the 3-vector associated @xmath34 is tangent to @xmath3 .    for a spherical shell , the region @xmath5exterior to the shell",
    "have the metric given by equation ( 2 ) . and the region @xmath35interior to the shell is minkowskian .",
    "the equation of the shell is :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the proper time measured by the dust particles .",
    "the equation of motion of the shell could be obtained from the lanczos equation @xcite :    @xmath38-g_{ij}\\left[k_{ab}g^{ab}\\right]\\right).\\ ] ]    from equations ( [ bs1 ] ) , ( [ fc1 ] ) , ( [ fc2 ] ) and ( [ fc3 ] ) we obtain rearranging therms :    @xmath39    we are interested in the velocity of the shell as measured by an external observer at rest at infinity , then we must replace :    @xmath40    if the shell is initially at rest :    @xmath41    because gravity is attractive it produces a flux entering to the thin gaussian region that encloses the shell and by this reason we must choose the negative sign . with these consederations",
    "we finally obtain : @xmath42    this equation is of difficult integration but fortunately we can do the following good approximation : +   + @xmath43 @xmath44    where @xmath45 must be chosen in order to match these two expressions for @xmath46 , where @xmath47 from this equation we obtain : @xmath48 and @xmath49",
    ".    then the motion equation reduces to : @xmath50 this equation could be integrated analytically to obtain : @xmath51\\right)}e^{\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)}.\\ ] ]    where @xmath52 , @xmath53 is the initial radius and @xmath54 and @xmath53 are measured in units of schwarzschild radius .    taking little variations of @xmath55 respect to @xmath53 we can obtain :    @xmath56    this important result sais that from the point of view of an external observer at rest and far from the horizon , the shell approaches to schwarzschild radius asymptotically .",
    "this is that we call a black shell model of a black hole .    for an observer comoving with the shell it is easy to see from ( [ fc5 ] ) , ( [ fc7 ] ) , ( [ fc8a ] ) and ( [ fc9 ] ) that",
    ":    @xmath57    integrating this equation we obtain :    @xmath58    then we see that the shell reaches the radius @xmath59 in the finite time :    @xmath60     + this is that we call a black shell free gravitational collapse .",
    "in this section we review the statistical derivation of bekenstein - hawking entropy ( @xmath0 ) for stationary black holes , using analytic continuation to euclidean sector and imposing a period on euclidean time .    according to gibbons - hawking derivation @xcite , and in order to obtain the bekenstein - hawking entropy",
    ", we calculate the action @xmath61 for the schwarzschild metric ( [ bs1 ] ) :    @xmath62    where @xmath20 is the schwarzschild spacetime with ( in natural units ) : @xmath10 , @xmath59 and @xmath45 is the second fundamental form .    using the equations ( [ f11 ] ) , ( [ f12 ] ) and ( [ f13 ] ) for @xmath63 and @xmath64 we obtain : +   + @xmath65 @xmath66    where @xmath67 is the euclidean period .",
    "then for the black hole mass , @xmath68 , we obtain :    @xmath69    this is the bekenstein - hawking entropy of a black hole as was derived by gibbons - hawking @xcite .",
    "for a black shell , according to section 3 above , the radius approaches to the schwarzschild one and by this reason we retrieve the horizon integral obtaining the euclidean action : +   + @xmath65 @xmath70    where @xmath67 is the euclidean period .    for a black shell",
    "the inner space is the empty space and by this reason : @xmath71 obtaining :    @xmath72    both results : ( [ fo3 ] ) and ( [ euc13e ] ) , are mathematically equivalent derivations of @xmath0 . in order to relate both procedures , consider the following mathematical identity :    @xmath73    @xmath74    this identity corresponds to a physical model that resolves one of the questions raised in mukohyama - israel @xcite , in the sense that @xmath0 is not a one - loop correction to the zero - loop gibbons - hawking contribution . indeed",
    "this entropy is a zero - loop black shell contribution .",
    "according to entanglement entropy model of black shells , thermal energy strongly concentrated near the exterior of a starlike object is clearly evident .",
    "this object has a reflecting surface , compressed to nearly ( but not quite ) its gravitational radius . following this model",
    "we may approximate the total stress - energy ( ground state and thermal excitations ) @xmath75 , near the wall , to the hartle - hawking stress - energy @xmath76 @xcite :    @xmath77    where @xmath78 is boulware stress tensor and @xmath79 are thermal excitations .",
    "thermofield dynamics encodes a reflexive symmetry between twin subsystems in such a way that each of them becomes macroscopically indistinguishable from a hot body at a definite temperature .",
    "the reflection symmetry of these subsystems corresponds to the right and left regions of an eternal black hole , i.e. , kruskal sectors r and l see ( fig .",
    "[ mg10i ] ) .",
    "thus , the twin subsystems correspond to field modes propagating in these ( causally disjoint ) kruskal sectors , and the thermally entangled state of the total system corresponds to the ground state on the full kruskal manifold . in that sense",
    ", this section defines modes and ground states appropriate for the subsystems @xmath80 and for the global system ( full kruskal manifold ) , i.e. , for stationary observers in a static spacetime ( killing - boulware modes ) and for free falling observers at the horizon of a black hole spacetime ( kruskal - hartle - hawking modes ) , and establishes the relationship between them .",

    "@xmath97 is analytic over the full kruskal manifold , with the property that @xmath98 is positive frequency in kruskal time .",
    "@xmath92 sector contribution to @xmath99 enters with negative sign , because @xmath29 and @xmath93 run backwards in this sector .",
    "modes in the @xmath92 sector and beneath the horizon have negative energies .",
    "we are talking about the continuous extension of the killing vector which is future timelike in the @xmath55 sector , and therefore becomes past - directed in the @xmath92 sector .",
    "physically , this definition of energy includes gravitational potential energy , which is negative and becomes large below the horizon . in the hartle - hawking state , positive energies in the @xmath55 sector are evenly balanced with negative energies in the @xmath92 sector .",
    "the state of the black hole is represented globally by the hartle - hawking state @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "the total energy of a quantum field in this state is zero , because of the balance between positive - energy modes in the r sector and negative - energy modes in the l sector .",

    "if we form the expectation value of @xmath101 in the state @xmath104 , only the l - sector part ( @xmath105 in eq .",
    "( [ ete54 ] ) ) of @xmath101 contributes , since there are no r - sector modes in this state .",
    "we thus find @xmath106 correspondingly , this same parochial observer , using his parochial energy operator @xmath107 , will perceive the hartle - hawking vacuum as energetically excited .",
    "if we form the expectation value of @xmath107 in the state @xmath100 , the operator will pick out only the positive - energy modes in @xmath55 , so @xmath108 where we have dropped zero - point energies .",
    "entanglement entropy actually allows us to think that entropy arises physically located near the horizon , given by @xcite    @xmath109    where @xmath110    the expressions above are similars to brick wall model @xcite , where @xmath111 is defined by the external observer , which it is the main difference with respect to brick wall model .",
    "in addition @xmath112 is finite according to thermo field dynamics @xcite .    according to this model , the integral  ( [ ete191 ] )",
    "is dominated by two contributions , for large @xmath113 and for small @xmath114 .",
    "the former corresponds to a volume term , proportional to @xmath115 , which represents the entropy and energy of a homogeneous quantum gas in a flat space at a uniform temperature @xmath116 .",
    "the latter is the contribution of gas near the inner wall @xmath117 .",
    "then , for this last contribution is required to introduce the ultrarelativistic approximations @xmath118    substituting eq .",

    "( [ ete191 ] ) , the wall contribution to the total entropy is obtained @xmath119 where @xmath120 accounts for helicities and the number of particle species , @xmath121 is the wall area and @xmath122 is the proper radial distance from horizon to the shell .",
    "now , depending on @xmath122 , we can obtain the bekenstein - hawking entropy from eq .",
    "( [ bw10 ] ) @xmath123 where @xmath122 can be adjusted by resorting to times determined by an external observer in the context of the black shell model .",
    "+ unlike black holes , equation ( [ bw10 ] ) corresponds to a microscopic description in terms of quantum field modes .",
    "we have described in sections 2 and 3 the motion of a spherical shell of dust that contracts beginning at rest from infinity by using darmois - israel thin shells formalism @xcite , then we obtain from the point of view of an external observer far from the horizon , that shell approaches to schwarzschild radius .",
    "this result is one of the main characteristic of the black shell model , introduced above .",
    "4 we reproduce geometrical bekenstein - hawking entropy of a schwarzschild black hole using the well known gibbons - hawking euclidean approach @xcite and derive in sec",
    ". 5 physical entropy of a black shell from gibbons - hawking euclidean approach retrieving horizon integral and discarding boundary at infinity .",
    "this important result was obtained considering that for a black shell the mass is outside the horizon . + for the sake of completeness , in sec .",
    "6 we return to entanglement entropy of black shells , because it is a complementary description of gibbons - hawking euclidean approach for a black shell .",
    "so we have completed and extended the idea of black shell presented in @xcite . in particular , we reproduce some results about it and complete details of the corresponding hamiltonian formulation . + we agree with s. mukohyama and w. israel that entropy contributed by thermal excitations or entanglement is not a one loop correction to the zero - loop gibbons - hawking contribution",
    ". actually we may consider these two entropy sources as equivalent but mutually exclusive descriptions of what is externally the same physical situation @xcite . in equation ( [ euc13f ] ) we observe that in the euclidean sector of the black shell space - time there is an inner boundary , the black shell itself .",
    "thus inner boundary contribution to the euclidean action cancels that of the outer boundary at infinity .",
    "so the gibbons - hawking zero - loop contribution is zero in this sense . + with the right identification of the ground state , the back - reaction problem in t hooft brick wall model is resolved @xcite . in that sense for black shells ,",
    "we show in ( [ ete88 ] ) that the divergent parts cancel each other .",
    "the boulware ground state contribution ( which is energetically depressed below the vacuum ) and thermal excitations cancel .",
    "+ in summary we propose an effective model consisting on a massive thin spherical shell contracting toward its gravitational radius with respect to an external observer in order to describe significant features of a gravitational collapsing mass .",
    "the collapsing massive shell is compressed near its gravitational radius defining an natural cut - off between horizon and shell depending on external observer . from this model",
