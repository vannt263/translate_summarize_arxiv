    "hadrons are the complex systems consisting of quarks and gluons , which makes a long and continuous way to precisely understand the hadron structure .",
    "thanks to the collinear factorization theorem@xcite in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the calculation of high energy hadron collision becomes much straightforward .",
    "the calculation is the product of the calculable hard process and the incalculable soft part which is absorbed into the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "although incalculable so far , parton distribution functions are universal coefficients which can be determined by the experiments conducted worldwide .",

    "given the nonperturbative input , the pdfs at high @xmath2 are predicted by using dglap equations from qcd theory .",
    "secondly , the nonperturbative input is determined by comparing the theoretical predictions to the experimental data measured at high scale .",
    "this procedure is usually chosen to be the least square regression method .",

    "although a lot of progresses have been made , the gluon distribution at small @xmath4 is still poorly estimated , which has large uncertainties@xcite .",
    "even worse , the gluon distributions from different collaborations exhibit large differences .",
    "gluon distribution needs to be more quantitative in terms with a number of physics issues relating to the behavior of it @xcite .",
    "pdfs at low resolution scale is always confusing since it is in the nonperturbative qcd region .",

    "therefore the nonperturbative input gives some valuable information of the nucleon .",
    "besides the powerful predictions of the qcd theory , other fundamental rules of hadron physics should also be reflected in the nonperturbative input .",
    "how does the pdfs relate to the simple picture of the proton made up of three quarks ? in the dynamical parton model@xcite , the input contains only valence quarks , valence - like light seas and valence - like gluon , which is consistent with the dressed constitute quark model .",
    "all sea quarks and gluons at small @xmath4 are dynamically produced . in the dynamical parton approach ,",
    "the gluon and sea quark distributions are excellently constrained by the experimental data , since there are no parametrizations for input dynamical parton distributions .",
    "parton radiation is the dynamical origin of sea quarks and gluons inside the proton .",

    "and the common way of improving the accuracy of the determined pdfs is to apply the higher order calculations of dglap equations .",

    "the qcd radiatively generated parton distributions at small @xmath4 and at high @xmath2 are tested extensively by the measurements of hard processes at modern accelerators .",
    "the most important correction to dglap evolution is the parton recombination effect .",

    "our gluon distribution is close to that of grv98 and mstw08 , but it is higher than that of ct10 .",
    "one thing we need to point out is that our gluon distributions are purely dynamically produced in the qcd evolution .",
    "we argue that this gluon distribution is more reliable since no arbitrary parametrization of input gluon distribution is involved .    our predicted difference between @xmath100 and @xmath101",

    "our strange quark distribution is purely dynamically generated , since there is no strange quark component in the parameterized nonperturbative input .",
    "compared to the up and down dynamical sea quark distributions , the dynamical strange quark distribution is suppressed in our approach .",
    "the suppression of the strange sea quark distribution is not hard to understand , because the current mass of the strange quark is much heavier than that of the up or down quark .",

    "the prominent advantage of the extended dynamical parton model is that there is no negative gluon density at any resolution scale , no matter how small the @xmath2 is .",
    "we provide a c++ package named imparton to access the obtained pdfs in the wide kinematic range , in order to avoid the complicated qcd evolution with glr - mq - zrs corrections and make the practical applications of the pdfs easier .",

    "two data sets of the global analysis results , called data set a ( fit 2 result ) and data set b ( fit 3 result ) , are provide by the package .",
    "data set a is from the three valence quarks nonperturbative input , and data set b is from the nonperturbative input of three valence quarks adding flavor - asymmetric sea quark components , as discussed in sec .",

    "the package consists of a c++ class named imparton which gives the interface to the pdfs .",
    "imparton has a method imparton::setdataset(int setoption ) , which let the user choose data set a or data set b via setdataset(1 ) or setdataset(2 ) respectively ; the most important method of imparton is imparton::getpdf(int iparton , double x , double q2 ) , which is the method called by users to get the pdf values .",

    "the obtained gluon distribution is purely dynamically produced , without even the valence - like gluon distribution .",
    "the dynamical parton distributions generated in this approach expect to have small bias as a result of the strict theoretical constraints of the method . a c++ package named imparton",
    "is introduced to interface with the obtained pdfs .",
    "two pdf data sets are provided .",
    "one is from the three valence quarks input , and the other is from three valence quarks with a few flavor - asymmetric sea components .",
    "the obtained pdfs can be justified and updated with further investigations of many other hard processes , such as the drell - yan process , the inclusive jet production and the vector meson production .    by the global analysis",
    ", we find that the quark model on the proton structure has some interesting and good results .",
    "the three valence quarks can be viewed as the origin of the pdfs observed at high @xmath2 .",
    "our analysis also shows that the nonperturbatvie qcd effects beyond quark model are also needed to reproduce the experimental data in details . by adding the flavor - asymmetric sea components the quality of the global qcd fit improves significantly",
    "this is a clear evidence of the other nonperturbative parton components of proton beyond the quark model@xcite .",
    "it is interesting to know the fact that the sea quarks and gluons are mainly from the parton radiations of three valence quarks predicted by the quark model .",
    "however there are more degrees of freedom inside proton which needs the interpretations of the qcd theory in the future .",
    "the nonlinear effects of parton - parton recombinations are important at low @xmath2 and small @xmath4 . without the recombination processes ,",
    "the splitting processes generate much steep and large parton densities because of the long evolution distance from extremely low scale . at low @xmath2 , the strength of recombination processes are comparable to that of the parton splitting processes .",
    "thus the recombinations slow down enormously the fast splitting of partons at very small @xmath4 .",
    "the preliminary results show that the parton distribution measurements at high @xmath2 are directly connected to the nonperturbative models at low scale with the applications of dglap equations with glr - mq - zrs corrections .",
    "dglap equations with nonlinear terms is a simple tool to bridge the physics between the nonperturbative region and the perturbative region .",
    "the last but not least conclusion we want to draw is that the partons still exist at extremely low @xmath2 , although the definition / meaning of the parton distribution at low scale is not clear .",
    "the physics of partons at low @xmath2 is affected by the parton - hadron duality , which still needs a lot of investigations on both experimental and theoretical sides .",
    "based on this work , the valence quarks are the dominant partons at low @xmath2 and go down fast at the beginning of qcd evolution ( fig . [ valence_at_lowq2 ] ) .",
