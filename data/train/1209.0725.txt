    "identifying functionally important actors is a critical step in understanding and managing complex systems , whether it is a fortune 500 company or an ecosystem . for example",
    ", @xcite showed that an employee s power to affect administrative innovation within an advertising agency was in part determined by their positional importance within the organization . in ecological systems , knowing the relative functional importance of species or groups of species is essential for conservation biology , ecosystem management , and understanding the consequences of biodiversity loss @xcite .",
    "ecologists have several ways of classifying the relative importance of community members . @xcite introduced rank  abundance curves to describe the community richness and indicate the relative importance of the species , assuming that community importance was proportional to abundance .",
    "he also presented an alternative rank ",
    "productivity curve that indicated the species importance based on their net productivity .",
    "subsequent ecological concepts have built on this .",
    "keystone species @xcite are species whose importance to the community are disproportionate to their biomass , like the sea otter in pacific kelp forests .",
    "ecological engineers @xcite are species whose actions create whole new habitats , such as beavers that transform terrestrial environments into slow moving aquatic environments .",
    "@xcite introduced the more general term foundational species for fundamentally important species of many types @xcite .",
    "part of the challenge and the reason for multiple concepts , is that there are a diversity of ways in which a species may be important and contribute to a community or ecosystem .",
    "faced with the analogous problem of identifying important members of human communities , social scientists developed the _ centrality _ concept ( see * ? ? ?",
    "centrality embodies the intuition that some community members are more important , have more power , or are more central to community function .",
    "centrality was developed in the context of network models of communities in which individuals are represented as nodes of a graph and the graph edges signify a specific relationship between two individuals such as friendship or co - authorship ( fig .  [",
    "fig : cent - ex]a ) .",
    "the relationship may or may not be directed .",
    "degree centrality is the number of immediately adjacent neighbors on the graph , and it assumes that more connected nodes are more central .",
    "it is quantified as the number of edges incident to the node . in the example",
    "graph , node 3 has a degree of 7 ( note the separate directed pathways from 3 to 4 and from 4 to 3 shown as a two headed arrow ) . fig .  [",
    "fig : cent - ex]b shows the distribution of node degrees in the community which indicates that node 3 is the most central from this local neighborhood perspective .    some scientists have suggested that the local neighborhood is insufficient to determine the node s centrality for some applications , especially exchange networks @xcite . instead , a node s importance may be increased because one or more of its neighbors are important .",
    "network models can capture this increased neighborhood size by defining a _ walk _ as a sequence of edges traveled from one node to another , and walk length ( @xmath1 ) is the number of edges crossed . in the example network , there is a walk from 6 to 2 of length @xmath2 by following @xmath3 .",
    "this enables us to consider the neighborhood @xmath1 steps aways @xcite .",
    "[ fig : cent - ex]c shows the eigenvector centrality @xcite for the example network which identifies the equilibrium number of paths passing through each node as @xmath4 . in this sense",
    "it is a global centrality measure because it is a `` summary of a node s participation in the walk structure of the network '' @xcite and captures the importance of indirect as well as direct interactions @xcite .",
    "degree and eigenvector are only two examples of centrality indicators .",
    "many centrality measures have been developed and applied in the literature for complex systems modeled as networks @xcite .",
    "the centrality measures tend to be correlated @xcite , but the differences can be informative @xcite .",
    "@xcite provide a classification of centrality indices and shows how and why different measures are useful for different applications .",
    "ecologists have applied the centrality concept in several ways .",
    "for example , landscape ecologists have used centrality to assess the connectivity of habitat patches , how this connectivity effects organism movement , and how habitat loss changes the connectivity @xcite .",
    "community and ecosystem ecologists have developed and used centrality measures to study how organisms influence each other in transaction networks @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue that mesoscale measures , between local and global centralities , are most useful for ecosystem studies because the impact of indirect effects tend to decay rapidly as they radiate through the system .",
    "recent work used centrality indicators to determine important species in communities of mutualists @xcite . collectively , this work shows how a range of centrality indicators can be useful for addressing ecological questions .    here",
    ", i identify a new centrality indicator for ecology , termed throughflow centrality @xmath0 .",
    "i first recognize that the throughflow measure ecosystems ecologists have long calculated @xcite is a global measure of node importance in generating the total system activity .",
    "further , i show that this is a special case of hubbell s status index centrality @xcite .",
    "i then apply this measure to 45 trophic ecosystem models drawn from the literature to test two hypotheses regarding ecosystem organization .",
    "the first hypothesis suggested by both @xcite and @xcite is that communities are composed of a relatively few dominant species and larger group that are less central .",
    "the second hypothesis is that in ecosystems the dominant species / groups are expected to be comprised of primary producers , decomposers like bacteria , and non - living groups included in ecosystem models like dead organic matter .",
    "this hypothesis stems from trophodynamic theory and energetic constraints of food chains @xcite",
    "a core claim of this paper is that the amount of energy ",
    "matter flowing through each node @xmath5 in an ecosystem network  termed node throughflow ( @xmath0 )  is a global centrality indicator of the node s functional importance .",
    "in fact , this centrality measure is a special case of status score .",
    "further , this centrality indicator is more useful for ecologists and environmental scientists than the classic eigenvector centrality or the recently introduced environ centrality @xcite because ( 1 ) it is more intuitive to calculate , ( 2 ) it integrates the transient and equilibrium effects as flow crosses increasingly longer pathways , and ( 3 ) it captures the effects of environmental inputs ( outputs ) on the system flows .",
    "this section provides evidence to support these claims .",
    "flow analysis is a major branch of ecological network analysis ( ena ) @xcite .",
    "it is an environmental application and development of macroeconomic input - output analysis first imported to ecology by @xcite .",
    "it traces the movement of energy ",
    "matter through the network of transactions in an ecosystem to characterize the organization and development of the system .",
    "flow analysis is applied to a network model of energy ",
    "matter exchanges .",
    "the system is modeled as a set of @xmath6 compartments or nodes that represent species , species - complexes ( i.e. , trophic guilds or functional groups ) , or non - living components of the system in which energy ",
    "matter is stored .",
    "nodes are connected by @xmath7 observed fluxes , termed directed edges or links .",
    "this analysis requires an estimate of the energy ",
    "matter flowing from node @xmath5 to @xmath8 over a given period , @xmath9 $ ] , @xmath10 ( note the column to row orientation ) .",
    "this flux can be generated by any process such as feeding ( like a food web ) , excretion , and death .",
    "as ecosystems are thermodynamically open , there must also be energy ",
    "matter inputs into the system @xmath11 $ ] , and output losses from the system @xmath12 $ ] . in some applications",
    ", outputs are partitioned into respirations and exports to account for differences in energetic quality , but this is not necessary in this case . for other analyses ,",
    "it is useful when the amount of energy  matter stored in each node ( e.g. , biomass ) is also reported , @xmath13 $ ] @xcite .",
    "the necessary model data @xmath14 can be summarized as @xmath15 .    to validly apply flow analysis ,",
    "the network model must meet two analytical assumptions .",
    "first , the model must trace a single , thermodynamically conserved currency such as energy , carbon , or nitrogen .",
    "second , the model must be at steady - state for many of the analyses .",
    "this means that the sum of the energy ",
    "matter flowing into a node equals that exiting the node such that its storage or biomass is not changing .",
    "@xcite offer further suggestions for better ecosystem network model construction .",
    "given this model , we can apply flow analysis .",
    "the technique has a dual approach .",
    "input oriented _ analysis pulls the energy ",
    "matter from the boundary outputs and mathematically traces the pathways ( a sequence of @xmath1 edges ) used to generate them all the way to the boundary inputs .",
    "in contrast , the _ output oriented _ analysis pushes inputs into the system and follows their paths through the system to their boundary loss .",
    "this paper focuses on the output oriented analysis to support the centrality claims for brevity and clarity ; the input perspective provides similar support .",
    "the first analytical step is to calculate the node throughflows ( @xmath16,\\ : j=1,2,\\ldots , n$ ] ) .",
    "@xcite showed that the input and output oriented throughflows can be calculated from the initial model information @xmath14 as follows :    @xmath17    at steady state , @xmath18 = [ t_j^{\\textrm {      out } } ] = \\mathbf{t}$ ] and the amount of energy ",
    "matter stored in the node ( @xmath19 ) does not change through time .",
    "@xcite argued that the sum of the node throughflows , called total system throughflow ( @xmath20 ) , is a measure of the activity or size of the ecosystem functioning .",
    "@xcite interpret @xmath0 as the gross production of the compartment .",
    "thus , @xmath0 is the contribution of the @xmath21 node to the whole system functioning or productivity .",
    "it is in this sense that throughflow is a centrality measure indicating the relative importance or contribution of each node .",
    "[ fig : gom ] shows an example of rank ordered @xmath0 for the gulf of maine ecosystem network @xcite .",
    "this shows the larger functional importance of phytoplankton , large and small copepods , detritus , bacteria in this system .",
    "this matches with the theoretical expectation that primary production and decomposition tend to be the critical components of ecosystem functioning @xcite , but it also points to the importance of smaller consumers in the gulf of maine . notice the similarity of this presentation to the rank  abundance and rank  productivity curves that @xcite introduced to compare the relative importance of plants in a community . like those original curves , @xmath0 suggests that in this system there are a few dominant or more important species and a long tail of functionally less critical species ( e.g. , pinnipeds , beleen whales , and pelagic sharks ) .",
    "the application section considers the generality of both of these patterns .    to facilitate comparisons between centrality measures ,",
    "it is useful to consider the node throughflow scaled by the total system throughflow ( @xmath22 ) such that @xmath23 .",
    "while the rank - ordering is preserved , rescaling in this way eliminates the units and differences in total magnitude between systems or other centrality measures .",
    "this focuses on intensive system differences while ignoring extensive differences present without the rescaling .",
    "rescaling centrality measures is common , though it can introduce its own challenges @xcite .",
    "path decomposition of throughflow lies at the core of ena @xcite , and shows why @xmath0 is a global measure of functional importance .",
    "it partitions the flow of energy ",
    "matter from the input ( output ) over paths of increasing length ( number of directed edges , @xmath24 ) within the system required to generate @xmath0 .",
    "recall that local centrality measures focus on the connections to a node s nearest neighbors or a restricted neighborhood , while more global measures consider the relationships between all nodes within the system .",
    "path decomposition of flow starts by calculating the output oriented _ direct flow intensities _ @xmath25 $ ] from node @xmath5 to @xmath8 .",
    "these intensities are defined as    @xmath26    here , @xmath27 is the fraction of output throughflow at donor node @xmath5 contributed to node @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath27 values are dimensionless and the column sums of @xmath28 must lie between 0 and 1 with at least one column less than 1 because of thermodynamic constraints of the original model @xcite .    the second step determines the output oriented _ integral flow intensities _ @xmath29 $ ] as    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the matrix multiplicative identity and the elements of @xmath32 are the fractions of boundary flow that travel from node @xmath5 to @xmath8 over all pathways of length @xmath1 .",
    "as the power series must converge given our initial model definition , the exact values of @xmath33 can be found using the identity @xmath34 .",
    "the @xmath35 elements represent the intensity of boundary input that passes from @xmath5 to @xmath8 over all pathways of all lengths .",
    "these values integrate the boundary , direct , and indirect flows .",
    "we can use @xmath33 to recover @xmath36 as follows :    @xmath37    this suggests that the path decomposition of throughflow shown in equation ( [ eq : n ] ) is a true partition of the pathway history of energy  matter in the system at steady - state .",
    "the path decomposition in equation ( [ eq : n ] ) shows how the throughflows are a global measure of centrality because the observed throughflows are generated by energy ",
    "matter moving over all pathways of all lengths such that the whole connected system is considered , not just a local neighborhood .",
    "notice that the importance of longer pathways is naturally discounted as energy ",
    "matter is lost as it passes through nodes in the path .",
    "this discount or decay rate varies among ecosystems and model types @xcite .",
    "multiplication of the integral flow matrix by the boundary inputs to recover @xmath0 ( equation [ eq : tn ] ) illustrates how the node throughflows capture the potential effect of heterogeneous boundary inputs known to be a factor in ecosystems @xcite .      before @xcite applied economic input ",
    "output ideas to ecological systems , @xcite applied the formalism to social systems . in doing so",
    ", he created a centrality measure that is known as hubbell status or hubbell centrality .",
    "although hubbell s initial model was different than the ecological one presented in section  [ sec : model ] , the analytical mathematics is parallel to that shown for throughflow analysis .",
    "@xcite started by modeling the interactions between individuals in a community using a weighted sociometric choice matrix @xmath38 , ( i , j=1, ... ,n)$ ] , where @xmath39 can be positive or negative and indicates individual @xmath5 s indication of the strength of relationship between him or herself and individual @xmath8 . the integral relationship strength among the community members propagated across the whole set of pathways @xmath40",
    "are then determined as    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is again the matrix multiplicative identity and @xmath43 is the strength of relationship between any two community members over paths of length @xmath1 .",
    "when the series converges , we can find @xmath40 exactly as @xmath44 .",
    "building off of this analysis , @xcite defined the _ status score _ @xmath45 $ ] of member @xmath8 as    @xmath46    where @xmath47 $ ] are the system exogenous inputs .    while the initial model was different ,",
    "the throughflow equation ( [ eq : tn ] ) is identical in form to hubbell s status shown in equation ( [ eq : status ] ) .",
    "thus , what ecologists call throughflow @xmath0 is a special case of hubbell s status index @xmath48 when the model is defined as in section ( [ sec : model ] ) .      to highlight its distinctiveness , @xmath0",
    "is contrasted with two alternative global centrality measures : eigenvector centrality and environ centrality .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , eigenvector centrality ( evc ) describes the stable distribution of pathways , or when weighted as in flow networks the stable distribution of flow , passing through the nodes @xcite . in the context of directed flow networks",
    ", @xcite suggested using the average of the left @xmath49 and right @xmath50 hand eigenvector associated with the dominant eigenvalue of @xmath28 to capture both the input and output , such that    @xmath51 = \\frac{(w_i + v_i)}{2}.   \\label{eq : evc}\\ ] ]    note , in this calculation @xmath49 and @xmath50 are assumed to have been normalized so that their sum equals 1 , which also implies that @xmath52 . in symmetric networks like those for which the eigenvector centrality was first defined @xmath53 and averaging",
    "is not necessary . in directed flow networks",
    "@xmath54 , and evc captures the input and output oriented flows intensities .",
    "@xcite introduced average environ centrality ( aec ) and argued that it is a better centrality indicator for ecosystem flow networks in part because it captures both the equilibrium dynamics ( like evc ) and transient dynamics that occur along the initial shorter pathways in equation  ( [ eq : n ] ) .",
    "this is important because in highly dissipative systems like trophic ecosystems , a large fraction of the total transactions might occur in these shorter pathways .",
    "specifically , @xcite found that in nine trophic ecosystem models 95% of tst required at most paths of length nine .",
    "aec is defined as    @xmath55 = \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^n n_{ij}}{\\sum_{i=1}^n\\sum_{j=1}^n n_{ij } }   \\\\",
    "\\notag ec^{out } & = [ ec^{out}_{j } ] = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n n_{ij}}{\\sum_{i=1}^n\\sum_{j=1}^n n_{ij } } \\\\",
    "aec & = [ aec_{k } ] \\frac{ec_{j}^{in } + ec_{j}^{out}}{2}. \\label{eq : ec }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    although aec is an improvement on evc , both measures still suffer from two problems .",
    "the first issue is that the calculations required for evc and aec are not intuitive , which could be a barrier to their wider use in ecology @xcite .",
    "the second more substantive issue is that they fail to recognize or capture the external environmental forcing occurring in these open systems .",
    "both measures are built on the non - dimensional flow intensity matrices that represent the potential flows or the flows if each node had a unit input . however , to recover the _",
    "realized _ or observed system activity these matrices must be multiplied by the boundary vector as in equation [ eq : tn ] ( see * ? ? ?",
    "a critical issue is that the vector of boundary inputs in ecosystem models tends to be highly heterogeneous @xcite , which differentially excites the potential flow pathways captured in @xmath28 and @xmath33 .",
    "given these issues , in many applications @xmath0 is a better indicator of the functional importance of a node because its calculation is more intuitive and because it captures the system s environmental forcing .",
    "the difference between these indicators can be substantive as illustrated for the ythan estuary and chesapeake bay ecosystem models ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tvevc ] ) . in the ythan estuary",
    ", @xmath36 is highly rank correlated with evc ( spearman s @xmath56 ) and aec ( @xmath57 ) , but @xmath36 ranks the nutrient pool , suspended poc , and benthic macrophytes as the top three nodes , which is not the case for the other two indicators .",
    "the first two of these nodes have boundary input .",
    "the spearman rank correlation between @xmath36 and evc and aec is generally less in the chesapeake bay model ( @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively ) .",
    "again , evc and aec discount the importance of some nodes . in this case , the top three nodes  phytoplankton , suspended particulate carbon , and dissolved organic carbon  have non - zero boundary input .",
    "thus , @xmath36 better captures the importance of nodes that connect the system to its external environment , and how this influence propagates throughout the system .    in summary , throughflow is a global centrality indicator of the functional importance of nodes in a flow network .",
    "it is a special case of what @xcite defined as a status score in sociology . due to the natural discounting of longer pathways as energy or matter dissipates from the system , it has the desirable properties of mesoscale centrality measures advocated for by @xcite . while it is similar to eigenvector and environ centrality measures , it is more intuitive to calculate and better captures the environmental forcing of the internal system activity .",
    "the next section applies @xmath36 centrality to characterize the distribution of functional importance in 45 ecosystem models .",
    "given that @xmath0 is a global indicator of an ecosystem component s functional importance , we can now investigate the distribution of this importance in ecosystems .",
    "i applied flow analysis to 45 trophic ecosystem models selected from the literature and calculated @xmath0 to investigate the throughflow centrality distributions ( table  [ tab : models ] ) . to be included in this data set ,",
    "the models needed to have at least 10 compartments , have a food web at their core ( i.e. , trophic models ) , and be empirically - based in the sense that the original modelers were attempting to represent a real ecosystem and used empirical measurements to parametrize part of the fluxes . if two models existed in the literature for the same system , only the least aggregated model ( higher @xmath6 ) was included .",
    "ten ( 22% ) of these models are included in dr .",

    "rank correlation between @xmath36 and aec and evc are shown for the oyster reef and chesapeake bay ecosystem models in section  [ sec : evec ] . here ,",
    "this result is generalized by examining distributions of the spearman rank correlation between these measures in all 45 models in our database .      to characterize the @xmath36 distributions within a model",
    ", i defined three thresholds .",
    "n@xmath60 is the number of nodes required to cumulatively account for 50% of @xmath61 when the compartments are rank ordered based on throughflow ( largest to smallest ) .",
    "if a monod function fit the cumulative flow distribution , n@xmath60 would be equivalent to the half saturation constant .",

    "these thresholds are illustrated for the bothnian sea , chesapeake bay , and sylt - rm bight ecosystems ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cs ] ) . in the bothnian sea ,",
    "only three nodes are required to generate 50% of the tst ( n@xmath64 ) , while 6 and 8 nodes are required to account for 80% and 95% of tst , respectively ( n@xmath65 and n@xmath66 ) . in the chesapeake bay model",
    ", these thresholds were n@xmath64 , n@xmath65 , and n@xmath67 , and in the sylt - rm bight they were n@xmath64 , n@xmath68 , and n@xmath69 .",
    "as the three models shown here have different numbers of compartments , @xmath6 , it is difficult to compare these thresholds directly . for better comparisons , i normalized the thresholds by the model size as n@xmath70 .",
    "this gives the percent of nodes required to achieve the @xmath71% of @xmath61 .",
    "[ fig : cs ] shows that 33% of the model nodes are required to account for 95% of @xmath61 in the chesapeake bay model while only 22% of the nodes were required in the sylt - rm bight model .",
    "this might be interpreted as indicating that system power is more concentrated in the sylt - rm bight model .",
    "there are many ways of defining dominant species or compartments in ecological systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ", dominant compartments in the ecosystem were defined as the smallest subset of nodes required to recover 50% of @xmath61 .",
    "this definition lets us investigate both how many nodes are required for this ( @xmath72 ) as well as their identity . for analysis",
    ", these compartments were classified as primary producers ( e.g. , phytoplankton , submerged vegetation ) , dead organic matter ( e.g. , particulate organic matter , dissolved organic matter ) , bacteria ( e.g. , free living bacteria , bacteria , benthic bacteria ) , or other ( e.g. , filter feeders , meiofauna , large copepods ) .",
    "detritus is technically a mixture of decomposers ( some bacteria ) with dead organic matter . for this analysis",
    ", detritus was grouped with the dead organic matter .",
    "as expected , evc and aec tend to be well correlated with @xmath36 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : centrankcor ] ) .",
    "the median spearman rank correlation between @xmath36 and evc is 0.69 , with the values ranging between 0.11 and 0.87 .",
    "throughflow centrality is similarly correlated with aec with a median value of 0.69 .",
    "the distribution is visibly shifted to the right and has values ranging from 0.28 to 0.92 .",
    "notice that in no case is there 100% agreement or disagreement .",
    "figure  [ fig : nx ] shows the cumulative flow development thresholds ( @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 ) for the 45 trophic network models .",
    "there are several trends to note .",
    "first , the maximum number of nodes necessary to account for 50% of @xmath61 was 4 . while in the bothnian bay ecosystem model",
    "this is 33% of the nodes , it is only 3.2% of the nodes in the florida bay model .",
    "second , as the models increase in size ( @xmath6 ) both @xmath73 and @xmath74 tend to decline .",
    "third , figure  [ fig : nx]b shows that in the majority ( 73% ) of the models , 20% of the nodes or fewer account for 80% or more of the system activity .",
    "figure  [ fig : nx]a shows that 4 or fewer nodes are required to account for 50% of the @xmath61 and thus meet the criteria as dominants . the majority ( 46% ) of the models",
    "analyzed had three dominant nodes , while another 29% had only two dominant compartments ( fig .",
    "[ fig : doms]a ) .    table  [ tab : n50 ] identifies the 130 dominant nodes in each of the 45 ecosystems .",
    "the authors of the original models did not necessarily use identical categorizations for different ecosystem components , but it is possible to classify the compartments into four functional groups : primary producers , dead organic matter , bacteria , and a final category for anything else ( other ) . figure  [ fig :",
    "doms]b shows the fraction of models that had at least one dominant in each of these categories .",
    "thus , 82% of the models had at least one dominant compartment that functioned as a primary producer ; 91% had a dominant compartment that was categorized as dead organic matter .",
    "bacteria were also common",
    ". only 9 of the dominant nodes did not fall into one of these three categories , and they only appeared in 7 of the models .",
    "next i consider the theoretical development and its initial ecological application presented in this paper from three perspectives .",
    "first , i highlight some of the advantages and disadvantages of recognizing that system throughflow is a centrality indicator .",
    "second , i contemplate the import of this discovery for understanding ecological system organization , growth , and development .",
    "third , i identify additional possible applications of this innovation .",
    "a primary contribution of this paper is to recognize that throughflow @xmath36 , a measure used by ecologists for some time ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is a centrality measure as defined in the social science @xcite and now used in general network science @xcite .",
    "an advantage of connecting throughflow and centrality is that ecologists can now access , apply , and further develop the existing body of work on centrality .",
    "for example , many centrality measures have been proposed , but sociologists can generally classify them into one of three types @xcite .",
    "the first type are degree based measures .",
    "these measures can vary in the size of the neighborhood considered  from the immediate local neighborhood to global measures that consider the whole system ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this type of centrality is generally interpreted as the influence of the node on the network activity or its power to change the activity @xcite .",
    "a second type of centrality is termed closeness and is based on the shortest paths or geodesic distances between nodes .",
    "@xcite suggests that these measures indicate the immediacy of a node s ability to influence the network .",
    "a third commonly described type of centrality is betweeness @xcite .",
    "a node s betweeness centrality is its importance in transmitting activity between individuals or subgroups in the network .",
    "thus , there is a recognition of several different but complementary ways in which individuals in a system can be central .    in this broader context of centralities ,",
    "hubbell s status is a global , weighted , degree based centrality that is typically interpreted as the node s influence on the whole system activity or its power to change the whole system activity @xcite .",
    "the formulation allows the node s centrality to be recursively changed by the centrality of the other nodes in the system as its walk connectivity is extended .",
    "although @xcite initially considered a potentially heterogeneous set of exogenous inputs , in practice a uniform set of inputs are typically used to consider the potential centrality .",
    "this is similar to the `` unit '' input analytical approach often used in network environ analysis @xcite . in the ecological application of hubbell centrality",
    ", the realized throughflow centrality is obtained using the observed exogenous inputs .",
    "ecologists can further benefit from the sociologists previous applications of centrality .",
    "for example , hubbell initially used his centrality as a tool to detect subcommunities or cliques within the system .",
    "as this is again a common concern for ecologists @xcite , we may be able to utilize his procedure to address this problem in the future .",
    "this would follow successful application of a different social network analysis clique finding algorithm to food webs .",
    "another advantage is that we may be able to recognize other ena measures as centrality type indicators .",
    "for example , several of descriptions of alternative centrality measures for what he called `` total effects centrality '' were very similar to what @xcite called total environ throughflow ( tet ) .",
    "thus , tet may also be a type of weighted degree centrality measure that indicates the relative contribution of each environ to the whole system activity .",
    "@xcite has already begun to explore this possibility while investigating nitrogen cycling model of the cape fear river estuary .",
    "there are two potential disadvantages of recognizing throughflow as a centrality indicator .",
    "first , it could contribute to the proliferation of centrality measures that can be overwhelming .",
    "this has led to multiple papers trying to identify the unique contributions of specific indicators amongst a set of competing indicators ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case , however , i argue that we are not creating a new centrality index to add to the confusion , but identifying that a commonly calculated measure is a form of an existing centrality measure",
    ". a second disadvantage might be that the current use and implementation of hubbell s centrality available in software packages may be simplified from its original formulation , as appears to be the case in ucinet @xcite .",
    "the output of the hubbell centrality analysis in ucinet does not match the throughflow vector as calculated with nea.m",
    "@xcite    as expected , @xmath36 generally correlates well with average eigenvector centrality ( evc ) and average environ centrality ( aec ) for the 45 models examined .",
    "this suggests that these different global degree - based centrality measures capture some of the same information about the relative importance of the nodes for the system function .",
    "however , the correlations were variable  in some cases the rankings were quite different ( e.g. , median spearman correlations were 0.69 and the lowest was 0.11 ) suggesting that each measure captured some unique information .",
    "examining both the formulation of the three centrality measures as well as the example in figure  [ fig : tvevc ] , a key difference is that @xmath36 captures the importance of a node for connecting the system to the external world .",
    "for example in the ythan estuary model , the nutrient pool and suspended poc both have large inputs that contribute to their importance in @xmath36 .",
    "thus in applications where the boundary inputs are an important consideration , an indicator like throughflow centrality may be the best choice .",
    "for example , @xcite argued that this system  environment coupling is critical for ecologists and environmental scientists even when the analytical focus is on the within system environments .",
    "ecologists have a long interest in the organization , growth , and development of ecosystems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "what are the processes that create , constrain , and sustain ecological systems ?",
    "scientists investigating this problem have hypothesized a number of goal functions or orientors that might guide the growth and development of these self - organizing systems @xcite .",
    "hypothesized orientors include the tendency for ecosystems to maximize power @xcite , maximize biomass or storage @xcite , maximize dissipation @xcite , and maximize emergy @xcite .",
    "@xcite used the network framework to show how these different orientors can be complementary .",
    "@xcite suggested that throughflow in network models of energy flux can be interpreted as a measure of _ power _ in a thermodynamic sense .",
    "he argued that @xmath61 indicates the total power output of an ecological system .",
    "this operationalized maximum power principle for evolutionary systems and hypothesis that ecological systems tend to maximize their power in a network context .",
    "given this interpretation of @xmath61 , @xmath0 is therefore the partial power of each node ( @xmath75 ) in the network .",
    "interestingly , this thermodynamic interpretation to throughflow aligns with the social interpretation of this type of centrality as the power to influence the system @xcite . recognizing that network nodes in ecosystem models represent subsystems in a hierarchical context @xcite",
    ", then we can extend the maximum power hypothesis to each node . as all nodes would experience the same attraction to increase @xmath0",
    ", we might expect the @xmath0s to be more similar ( towards a uniform distribution ) . however , this maximization remains restrained by the evolutionary constraints of the individual organisms , including their participation within the existing ecosystem @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite argues that the formation of autocatalytic cycles can be an agency for ecosystem growth and development .",
    "these cycles can provide the positive feedback and selective pressure for individual nodes to tend to increase their @xmath0 .",
    "they also provide a selection pressure such that alternative nodes within an autocatalytic cycle compete for participation in throughflow and can be replaced by higher performing entities .",
    "@xcite further argues that the tendency of these cycles for centripitality  in this context attracting and capturing more resources  leads to the emergence of a system autonomy from the material cause of the system .",
    "thus , evolutionary constraints on species and the system constraints of interacting autocatalytic cycles might increase the variability of @xmath0 despite the homogenizing effect of the tendency to maximize throughflow .",
    "the throughflow threshold analysis of the 45 ecosystem models presented here indicates that throughflow centrality is far from uniform as it appears to follow something more like pareto s 80 - 20 rule in which 80% of the activity is done by 20% of the group @xcite .",
    "this suggests that throughflow centrality may be similar to if not exactly the scale free degree distributions commonly found in other types of complex systems @xcite .",
    "in addition , all but 8 of the dominant or most central nodes could be classified as primary producers , dead organic matter , or bacteria .",
    "this aligns with what we might expect from ecosystem theory in general and the importance of autocatalytic hypercycles like the autotroph @xmath76 decomposer cycle @xcite .",
    "network modeling and analysis , input - output analysis , and material flow analysis have broad application .",
    "the ideas originated in macro economics @xcite and as has been discussed are used in both sociology and ecology .",
    "thus , throughflow centrality may be useful in multiple domains of inquiry .    beyond the theoretical considerations for ecosystem growth and development , there are a number of ways in which the throughflow centrality indicator could be usefully applied for ecosystem management , conservation , and restoration .",
    "for example , the throughflow centrality analysis suggests which species or groups of species should be targeted in the goal is to increase or decrease the system activity .",
    "the impact of manipulating a more central node should be greater than modifying a less central node .",
    "materials flow analysis is an important tool for industrial ecology @xcite and urban metabolism @xcite .",
    "the specific ena methods described in this paper have been used to analyze the sustainability of urban metabolisms @xcite .",
    "@xcite shows how throughflow can be grouped according to compartment `` trophic levels '' to build productivity pyramids for cities that are then comparable to expected trophic productivity pyramids in ecology .",
    "thus , the recognition that @xmath36 is a centrality indicator could have a broad utility for these disciplines .",
    "ena is an ecoinformatic tool and shares many goals and characteristics with network analysis in the field of systems biology .",
    "for example , @xcite showed that genes with higher centrality tend to be functionally more important in protein - protein interaction networks .",
    "while thermodynamically conserved flows are not normally the focus of the systems biology network models ( omics ) making it difficult to apply the flow analysis and ena more broadly , @xcite suggest a way of liking a metabolic network model to the underlying chemical fluxes and reactions .",
    "if this technique proves robust , then the throughflow centrality might be useful in this domain as well .",
    "in summary , this paper makes two primary contributions .",
    "first , i show that throughflow ( @xmath0 ) in network input - output models is a global indicator of the relative importance or power of each node in the network with respect the whole system activity . as calculated in ecological network analysis , this is a special case of hubbell centrality @xcite .",
    "second , when applied to trophic network models of ecosystems , throughflow centrality shows the tendency of this power to be concentrated in a small set of nodes that tend to categorized as primary producers , dead organic material , or bacteria .",
    "this is consistent with previous theory regarding the growth and development of ecological systems .    to address the wicked problems @xcite of our time like economic challenges and global climate change",
    ", we will need to be both creative and innovative .",
    "an innovation in this paper is to join the throughflow concept in flow analysis and the centrality concept developed in the social sciences .",
    "i expect this to be a useful union that will enable new analysis and management of complex systems of many kinds including urban metabolisms , industrial ecosystems , and biogeochemical cycling and trophic dynamics in natural ecosystems .",
    "early ideas for this paper were first presented at the 2011 meeting of the international society for ecological modelling in beijing , china and benefited from conversations with several colleagues including ursula scharler , john schramski , bernie patten , sven jrgensen , and jeff johnson .",

    "<S> further , throughflow is a special case of hubbell status or centrality as defined in social science . </S>",
    "<S> this recognition effectively joins the concepts , enabling ecologists to use and build on the broader centrality research in network science . </S>",
    "<S> second , i characterize the distribution of throughflow in 45 empirically - based trophic ecosystem models . </S>",
    "<S> consistent with theoretical expectations , this analysis shows that a small fraction of the system components are responsible for the majority of the system activity . in 73% of the ecosystem models , 20% or less of the nodes generate 80% or more of the total system throughflow . </S>",
    "<S> four or fewer nodes are required to account for 50% of the total system activity and are thus defined as community dominants . </S>",
    "<S> 122 of the 130 dominant nodes in the 45 ecosystem models could be classified as primary producers , dead organic matter , or bacteria . </S>",
    "<S> thus , throughflow centrality indicates the rank power of the ecosystems components and shows the concentration of power in the primary production and decomposition cycle . </S>",
    "<S> although these results are specific to ecosystems , these techniques build on flow analysis based on economic input - output analysis . </S>",
    "<S> therefore these results should be useful for ecosystem ecology , industrial ecology , the study of urban metabolism , as well as other domains using input - output analysis .    </S>",
    "<S> input  output analysis , food web , trophic dynamics , social network analysis , ecological network analysis , materials flow analysis , foundational species </S>"
