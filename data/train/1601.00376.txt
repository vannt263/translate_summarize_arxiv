    "+   + studies of the milky way is generally focussed on a central luminuous region described by a bulge consisting mainly of old stars and a stellar disk whose luminous density falls off sharply at around 13 kpc and becomes negligible at 16 kpc and the hi gas region outside the stellar disk .",

    "the failure of the freeman model at these scales is generally assumed to be due to dark newtonian particles . within non - newtonian gravity interpretation",
    "this failure can be addressed by a non - newtonian term taking effect from @xmath159 such as conformal gravity [ 20 ] and mond [ 21 ] and produces a flatten rotational curve upto @xmath160 where the studies usually end .",
    "+   + alternatively , one can show that the failure of the freeman function at @xmath161 can be ascribed to a region of high m / l ratio from @xmath162 [ 19 ] which claim visual support from the observed dark side - view of spiral galaxies . in ref .",
    "19 by assuming that the gravitational forces are balanced against the centrifugal forces at each and every point in a finite series of concentric rings , fitting the observed rotation speeds profile one recovers a freeman model mass density profile near the galactic centre but as one goes towards the edge of stellar disk the mass density behaves like mestel model with higher m / l ratio .",
    "( the total luminuous mass estimate is @xmath163 kg at a distance of 30 kpc [ 19 ] ) similarly , the flatten rotation curves can be produced by the maximum disk model [ 22 ] in a study of 74 galaxies based on the van albada and sancisi hypothesis [ 23 ] that for `` unknown reasons '' that luminous matter aggregates maximally inside the stellar disk and bulge so that it can account for the rotational curves ( and dark matter density if any would be highly constrained by luminuous matter density ) .",
    "in fact , the sufficiency of mass within the stellar disk to explain the rotation speeds are also found in ref .",

    "also from freeman [ 26 ] , at 10 kpc the bulge is found to consist mainly ( @xmath171 ) of very old stars of low `` luminosity to mass '' ratio , and these old stars also support a history of accretions towards the bulge from large distances clouds . from eq .",

    "we also note that there is a mass increase of @xmath183 kg between 106 kpc to 120 kpc leading to a jump in rotational curve . using the derived mass from observation @xmath184 kg at 120 kpc as an input , at 189 kpc the rotation speed from eq .

    "this solution has no free parameter and the edm term has a built - in dependence on the hubble parameter .",
    "this edm density can vary from being a large factor of an uniform mass density in an overdense region in the matter dominant epoch to becoming a massive halo density in the dark energy dominant epoch .",
    "we show how this new edm term can account for some observations which motivate the need for dark newtonian particles in different epochs and could provide answers for other difficulties that are not fully explained by the modified gravity approximation .",

    "however , the deviations from the schwarzschild metric are sufficient to put it in disagreement with the solar system data , essentially as a consequence of imposing radial - angular isotropy ( @xmath242 , etc . ) in the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "we examine the effects of dropping this condition . in the slow speed limit",
    "we find that the tradeoff in dropping isotropy to satisfy the data is to introduce an additional `` effective dark matter '' edm term in the equation of motion .",
    "for a spherically symmetric system we find that this edm becomes significant when the background energy density is comparable to the mass density . in a spiral galaxy , at large distances near a cut - off distance",
    "the edm becomes dominant and behaves like a massive halo and predicts a flattened rotational curve .",
    "using the estimates of the milky way , at smaller distances near a minimum potential `` bulge '' the edm density is negligible in comparison to the visible mass density and the orbits are newtonian .",
    "the effect of the edm from the bulge to the cut - off distance is to provide a much steeper non - newtonian potential that prevents matter from following the keplerian orbits .",
    "matter will follow a shorter spiral path to accrete around newtonian dominant orbits .",
    "for the rotational curve observations in the milky way , based on a single higher mass to luminosity ratio around the bulge , the rotational curve matches the observations extremely well up to 100 kpc .",
    "this edm term also predicts a non - newtonian flattened rotational curve from 600 kpc up to the galactic cutoff .",
    "the total mass is estimated to be around 3 times the observable mass .",
    "further , during the early matter dominant epoch , in the presence of the edm the baryonic matter perturbation growth rate is driven by the edm and and grows as the square of its non - edm rate and is thus fast enough to reach unity at low redshift and provide a natural mechanism for the large scale structure growth and early re - ionization .",
    "we also discuss how the edm can lift the higher peaks observed in the cmb power spectrum . where appropriate we comment on the edm s effect on the dynamical mass increase in clusters of galaxies and the suppression of the baryon acoustic oscillations .",
