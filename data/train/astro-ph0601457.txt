    "the so - called chang ",
    "refsdal lens was put forward to describe the lensing effects of stars in a background galaxy @xcite . the star acts as a point - mass lens , while the galaxy provides a background perturbation field , which can be approximated by a tidal term to lowest order .",
    "the chang  refsdal lens is therefore the simplest description of lensing by a tidally perturbed point - mass . as such",
    ", it has found widespread astronomical applications ",
    "e.g. in the modelling of binary microlensing lightcurves @xcite , in the analysis of the statistics of high - magnification events caused by stars in foreground galaxies @xcite , and in the study of microlensing of stars around the black hole in the galactic centre @xcite , and so on .    the chang  refsdal lens is of outstanding physical importance , but it also has a number of elegant mathematical properties , primarily because the ` deflection function ' is a rational function of position in the lens plane . although there has already been much work done on the structure of the caustics and critical curves @xcite , many of the properties of the chang  refsdal lens do not appear to be in the literature .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to give a compendium of those results .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : le ] presents the chang  refsdal lens utilizing the complex notation popularized by @xcite ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) . in section [ sec : ip ] , the lens equation is converted into the imaging polynomial , the roots of which include the image locations .",
    "provided that the source lies within the caustic  so that the number of images is four  then there exist invariants , such as the products of the image positions or the sums of the magnifications weighted by powers of the positions .",
    "section [ sec : ssa ] considers two cases when the lens equation is solvable via elementary means , namely when the source lies on one of the axes of the symmetry . in section [ sec : ccc ] , the pre - caustics of the chang  refsdal lens are isolated , together with the critical curves and the caustics .",
    "this enables us to calculate in section [ sec : lem ] the mean magnification of the 4-image configurations , and the exact form for a certain conditional distribution of magnifications .",
    "finally , sections [ sec : cb ] and [ sec : npm ] consider two generalizations of the chang  refsdal lens , namely the cases of a convergent background and of @xmath1 point masses with shear .",
    "we find that , with the convergence greater than unity , the number of images is either nil or two if the ` reduced shear ' is smaller than @xmath0 , nil , two , or four if it is in between @xmath0 and the unity , and two or four if it is greater than unity . as for @xmath1 point masses with shear , we establish that the maximum number of possible images are bounded by @xmath2 .",
    "the lowest order effect of the tidal field caused by the external mass distribution on gravitational lensing is usually described by a quadratic function that approximates the potential caused by the external masses . here",
    ", we assume that there is no external mass locally , i.e. , @xmath3 ( zero local convergence ; see section [ sec : cb ] for the discussion regarding the generalization when @xmath4 ) .",
    "then , the lensing potential @xmath5 due to the external mass distribution may be approximated to be @xmath6 , which is actually the most general form of a quadratic function satisfying laplace s equation .",
    "( the constant term in the potential has no physical consequence whilst the linear terms lead to a constant deflection , which can be ignored by introducing the ` offset ' between the coordinate origins for the source and the image position . )",
    "if a point - mass lens is present under the influence of this tidal field , the whole system is described by the total potential @xmath7 , which is a superposition of the point - mass potential and the external potential . here , the coordinate origin in the lens / image plane",
    "is defined by the line of sight towards the lens , and the unit of the angular measurement is given by the ` einstein ring ' radius corresponding to the mass of the point - mass lens .",
    "then , since the deflection angle is the gradient of the lensing potential , we find the lens equation ( @xmath8 ) : @xmath9 or more compactly , utilizing the complex number notation @xcite @xmath10 this is usually referred to as the chang  refsdal lens , after @xcite . here ,",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath12 are the vectors representing the angular positions of the source ( in the absence of the lensing ) and of the image , respectively , whereas @xmath13 and @xmath14 are their complexified variables . here",
    ", we use the overbar notation to denote the complex conjugation , e.g. @xmath15 . in the lens equation ,",
    "the effect of the tidal field is represented by a symmetric traceless tensor , or equivalently the complex number @xmath16 , usually referred to as an external shear .",
    "the components of the ( external ) shear are related to the ( external ) potential through @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the complex lens equation ( [ eq : crlz ] ) can also be directly derived from the lensing potential by recognizing that the ` complex scattering function ' or the ` deflection function ' is twice the ` wirtinger derivative ' ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of the lensing potential with respect to @xmath19 , i.e. , the lens equation being @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "it is easy to show that this reduces to equation ( [ eq : crlz ] ) with the lensing potential of the chang  refsdal lens given by @xmath22 , where c.c .",
    "indicates the complex conjugate of the terms in front . in general , the further ( wirtinger",
    ") derivatives of @xmath23 lead to the convergence @xmath24 and the total shear @xmath25 of the system . of a particular interest",
    "is that , for a null convergent region ( @xmath26 ) , the complex conjugate of the deflection function @xmath27 becomes analytic @xcite .",
    "the introduction of point masses to the system only adds isolated poles , and thus , the ( complex conjugate of the ) deflection function is described by a complex meromorphic ( i.e. , analytic everywhere except at isolated poles ) function for any lens system without a continuous mass distribution . as for the chang  refsdal lens , we find that @xmath28 where @xmath29 is not only a meromorphic function but actually a rational function of @xmath30 ( of degree 2 , provided that @xmath31 ) .",
    "this implies that the problem of ` solving ' the lens equation essentially reduces to finding zeros of a polynomial ( see section [ sec : ip ] ) .",
    "in addition , we have @xmath32 , that is to say , the total shear of the chang  refsdal lens is simply the sum of the ` internal shear ' ( i.e. , the @xmath33 term ) due to the point mass and the constant external shear @xmath34 .",
    "we note that it is always possible to choose the direction of the real axis such that @xmath34 is a positive real number .",
    "in particular , if @xmath35 in a given coordinate system , the rotation of the coordinate axis by an angle @xmath36 with respect to the origin achieves this . the direction defined by @xmath37",
    "is in fact one of the eigendirections of the shear tensor , which we shall refer to as the direction of the shear .",
    "the eigenvalue of the shear tensor associated with the direction of the shear is @xmath38 , which is sometimes just referred to as the shear by itself .",
    "since the shear tensor is real symmetric and traceless , the second eigendirection ( defined by @xmath39 ) is orthogonal to the direction of the shear and the associated eigenvalue is given by ` @xmath40 . ' in the literature , some authors choose the opposite sign convention for the tidal effect term in equations ( [ eq : crlvec ] ) and ( [ eq : crlz ] ) , which causes an ambiguity in the definition for the direction of the shear between the two eigendirections . our choice follows the usual weak lensing convention such that the direction of the image stretching distortion is along the direction of the shear , but implies that the direction to the mass that causes the tides is perpendicular to the direction of the tidal shear caused by it .",
    "the jacobian determinant of equation ( [ eq : crlvec ] ) , or equivalently , @xmath41 defines the area distortion factor under the linearized lens mapping .",
    "hence , the reciprocal of the jacobian determinant is ( the point - source limit of ) the ratio of the apparent solid angle covering the lensed image to that of the original source . since lensing neither creates nor destroys photons ( i.e.",
    ", the surface brightness is conserved ) , this also provides us with the ratio of the apparent flux of the image to that of the source , in the limit of a point source .",
    "when the individual images corresponding to the given source position are not resolved , the total magnification ( i.e. , the flux amplification factor ) is simply given by the sum of individual magnifications over all images .",
    "the point at which @xmath42 is known as the critical point , and the loci of the critical points are referred to as the critical curves ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , the source position that allows an image at a critical point is referred to as the caustic point , while the curves that are the mapping of the critical curves under the lens equation are the caustics  that is , a caustic point is the point on the caustics .",
    "the magnification of the image at the critical point and consequently the source on the caustics is formally infinite .",
    "the caustics are also the boundaries between the source positions with different number of images .",
    "( the converse is not necessarily true . )",
    "if there exist additional non - critical image positions that also map onto the caustics under the lens mapping , they are sometimes referred to as pre - caustic points .",
    "the pre - caustics are the loci of those non - critical points that map onto the caustics under the lens equation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the pre - caustics form the boundaries of the image positions that are the ( pre-)images of the interior of the caustics , whereas the critical curves are the division lines within them between disjoint domains that the image can not ` cross over ' .",
    "to find the image positions corresponding to a given source position @xmath43 , equation ( [ eq : crlz ] ) needs to be inverted for @xmath30 .",
    "the most straightforward route involves eliminating @xmath19 from equation ( [ eq : crlz ] ) by means of its own complex conjugate @xmath44 this results in a rational equation of @xmath30 @xmath45 where @xmath46 that needs to be solved for the image positions . in general ,",
    "the polynomials in the numerator and the denominator of @xmath47 as expressed in equation ( [ eq : impol ] ) are relative prime , and so the problem reduces to solving a quartic polynomial equation @xmath48 , which in principle can be solved algebraically .",
    "the result further implies that the number of the images allowed by equation ( [ eq : crlz ] ) for a given source position can not be greater than four .",
    "we note however that @xmath49 is only the necessary , but not the sufficient , condition for @xmath50 being one of the image positions . in other words ,",
    "not all of the zeros of @xmath47 are the solution of equation ( [ eq : crlz ] ) .",
    "for instance , if we replace @xmath19 with an unrelated new variable @xmath51 in equations ( [ eq : crlz ] ) and ( [ eq : econ ] ) , and solve for @xmath30 by eliminating @xmath51 , then the solution is still found from @xmath52 for which @xmath53 is not necessarily the complex conjugate of @xmath30 . where @xmath50 is a zero of @xmath47 ,",
    "then it can be proven that @xmath54 is another zero of @xmath47 distinct from the initial zero @xmath50 .",
    "that is , any zero of @xmath47 that does not correspond to an actual image position always occurs in a pair . ] therefore , to restrict the zeros of @xmath47 to actual image positions , an additional non - algebraic constraint that @xmath55 where @xmath49 is also required .",
    "we also note that some properties of the chang  refsdal lens can be examined through the analysis of the rational function @xmath47 and the quartic polynomial equation @xmath56 .",
    "for example , @xmath57 \\left(\\bar\\gamma-\\frac1{z^2}\\right ) \\label{eq : djac}\\ ] ] so that , if the solution @xmath50 of @xmath52 corresponds to an actual image position [ i.e. , @xmath58 , we find that @xmath59 .",
    "( here and throughout the paper , the use of the primed symbols will be reserved for the _ total _ derivative . )",
    "since the magnification must be real , this also implies that @xmath60 is the necessary condition for the zero @xmath50 of @xmath47 to correspond to an actual image position .",
    "in addition , if @xmath50 corresponds to a critical point , then @xmath61 , so that @xmath50 is a degenerate zero of @xmath47 . in other words ,",
    "if @xmath43 is a caustic point , then the imaging equation @xmath52 allows a degenerate solution that corresponds to a critical point .",
    "furthermore , @xmath62 if and only if @xmath63 , and therefore , the discriminant of the polynomial @xmath64 also provides an algebraic equation @xmath65 for the caustics points @xmath66 to satisfy .",
    "we further note that , if @xmath50 is the critical point that maps to a cusp point on the caustics , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , and thus that @xmath50 is a doubly - degenerate solution ( i.e. , a triple root ) of @xmath69 .",
    "in fact , if the deflection function is described by an analytic function , we can establish a connection between multiply - degenerate solutions of a certain analytic function derived from the deflection function and higher - order critical behaviour ( or ` catastrophe ' ) of the lens mapping at the corresponding point .",
    "however , the present analytic function @xmath47 can at most have a triple root for any @xmath70 so that the cusp catastrophe is the critical behaviour of the highest possible order for the chang  refsdal lens , provided that @xmath31 and @xmath71 .    next , for any rational function @xmath72 of @xmath30 , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are polynomials with no common factor , we find that there exist linear combinations of linearly - independent polynomials @xmath75^k[r_\\mathrm d(z)]^{4-k}$ ] @xmath76 that are divisible by @xmath64 .",
    "that is , @xmath77 or dividing by @xmath78 ^ 4 $ ] , @xmath79^k[r_\\mathrm d(z)]^{4-k}}{[r_\\mathrm d(z)]^4}=",
    "\\sum_{k=0}^4c_k[r(z)]^k=\\frac{q(z)g_\\mathrm n(z)}{[r_\\mathrm d(z)]^4}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 is a polynomial of @xmath30 .",
    "thus , for any rational function @xmath81 , its values @xmath82 at the image positions @xmath50 are zeros of a quartic polynomial @xmath83 , provided that @xmath81 does not diverge at the image position [ i.e. , there is no common factor between @xmath64 and @xmath74 ] .",
    "in particular , if the rational function is given such that @xmath85 $ ] where @xmath86 $ ] is a rational function of @xmath30 and @xmath51 that satisfies that @xmath86\\in\\mathbb r$ ] for @xmath87 , then only the real zeros of @xmath88 correspond to its values at image positions . furthermore , if @xmath89=\\overline{r[z , w]}$ ] , we can show that , for any non - real zero @xmath90 of @xmath88 where @xmath91 is a zero of @xmath47 that does not correspond to any actual image , its complex conjugate @xmath92 is also a zero of @xmath88 .",
    "hence , for this case , @xmath88 is completely factored into linear or irreducible quadratic polynomials with real coefficients , and therefore ( after the common scale factor has been taken out ) @xmath93 reduces to a _ real - coefficient _ quartic polynomial equation , and only its real solutions are valid , which correspond to the actual image positions .",
    "for example , if @xmath86=zw$ ] , then @xmath94=z\\bar z=|z|^2\\in\\mathbb r$ ] and @xmath89=\\bar w\\bar z=\\overline{zw}= \\overline{r[z , w]}$ ] , and so , with @xmath95=zf(z)=1+\\bar\\zeta z+ \\bar\\gamma z^2 $ ] , there exists a real quartic polynomial equation @xmath96 whose real solutions are @xmath97 where @xmath50 are the image positions . by equating the remainder of the polynomial division of @xmath98 by @xmath64 to be identically nil",
    ", we find the real coefficients ( up to a common multiplicative scale factor ) : @xmath99 the result implies that , for the 4-image chang  refsdal lens system , there exists a relation among the image positions that @xmath100 where @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 are the complex locations of four images .",
    "in fact , this relation can be derived from the stricter relation found from the coefficients of equation ( [ eq : impolc ] ) @xmath105 we note that there also exist similar real coefficient quartic polynomial equations for @xmath106 $ ] , @xmath107 $ ] , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and so on ( c.f . , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in principle",
    ", they can be found by entirely algebraic operations outlined above with the choice of the rational function being @xmath110 , @xmath111 $ ] , @xmath112[z - f(z)]^{-1}$ ] , or equation ( [ eq : djac ] ) , respectively although the actual algebra involved is rather messy .",
    "the fact that @xmath49 and @xmath113 for image positions @xmath50 implies that certain contour integrals involving @xmath114^{-1}$ ] reduce to the position - magnification moment sum over the all allowed images @xcite , provided that all zeros of @xmath47 are the actual image positions . here",
    ", we show that this also implies that the series of the position - magnification moment sums are coefficients for particular taylor - series expansion of @xmath114^{-1}$ ] ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "next , let us consider the contour integral @xmath119 where the integration path @xmath120 is taken to be a circle with a radius of infinity .",
    "however , the contour integral can also be evaluated using cauchy s residue theorem . since @xmath121",
    ", non - vanishing residue contributions to the integral are at @xmath122 where @xmath50 is a zero of @xmath47 [ i.e. , @xmath49 ] @xmath124= \\lim_{z\\rightarrow z_0}\\frac{(z - z_0)z^n}{g(z)}= \\frac{z_0^n}{g^\\prime(z_0)}\\ ] ] for any integer @xmath125 [ also assumed is that none of the zeros of @xmath47 is degenerate so that @xmath126 when @xmath49 ] , and at @xmath127 @xmath128=\\frac1{(m-1 ) ! } \\left.\\frac{\\mathrm d^{m-1}}{\\mathrm dz^{m-1 } } \\frac1{g(z)}\\right|_{z=0 } \\label{eq : ncf}\\ ] ] for a negative integer @xmath129 ( @xmath130 , 2 , @xmath131 ) .",
    "then , the residue theorem , together with equation ( [ eq : res ] ) indicates that @xmath132^{-1}\\right\\ } & \\mbox{for $ n=-1,-2,\\ldots$}\\end{array}\\right .",

    "i.e. , an actual image exists at every @xmath137  then from @xmath59 , the left - hand side of equation ( [ eq : msm ] ) is the same as the ( signed-)magnification - weighted moment sum over the all images .",
    "furthermore , the formal expressions given in equations ( [ eq : pcf ] ) and ( [ eq : ncf ] ) indicate that the sums in equation ( [ eq : msm ] ) are also the coefficients for the taylor - series expansion of @xmath114^{-1}$ ] , that is to say , @xmath138\\ ] ] at @xmath116 , or @xmath139\\ ] ] at @xmath127 .",
    "we note that this result is reminiscent of ramanujan s master theorem @xcite , which relates moment integrals and taylor coefficients .    from the series expansion of equation ( [ eq : impol ] ) at @xmath127 and @xmath116 , we can derived the following invariant position - moment sums for the chang  refsdal lens : @xmath140 @xmath141 in addition",
    ", we also find that @xmath142 which subsequently implies that @xmath143 \\frac1{{\\mathscr}j(z_k)}=0.\\ ] ] similar results have also been obtained by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "although it is in principle possible to solve equation ( [ eq : impol ] ) for the image positions with an algebraic technique such as ferrari s method ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for an arbitrary source position , the actual algebra is rather complicated , if not entirely uninteresting .",
    "in fact , for most cases , applying a simple numerical algorithm to solve the given quartic polynomial is more advantageous .",
    "however , if the source lies along either of the symmetry axes of the system , the complete analytic solutions are reasonably simple to derive and can be illuminating . for the simplicity of the algebra , throughout this section",
    ", we use the lens equation ( [ eq : crlz ] ) with the real direction given by the direction of the shear ( i.e. , the tide - causing mass lies along the pure imaginary axis ) so that @xmath34 is a positive real number ( i.e. , @xmath144 ) .      [ cols=\"^,<,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the limit on @xmath145 can be extended to the limit on the number of total images ( @xmath146 ) by deriving the relation between the numbers of positive and negative parity images ( @xmath145 and @xmath147 , respectively ) .",
    "let us first think of a function @xmath148 and @xmath149 then , the contour integral @xmath150 along the boundary of a domain @xmath151 vanishes , provided that the domain @xmath152 does not contain any image position ( i.e. , zeros of @xmath153 ) nor poles of @xmath29 [ i.e. , @xmath154 and @xmath155 for @xmath156 .",
    "this follows because the integrand is exact , so that it is closed in @xmath152 .",
    "furthermore , for an arbitrary domain @xmath152 that may contain image positions and/or poles , the integral can be evaluated by collapsing the contour to infinitesimally small circles around each image position and pole .",
    "suppose that @xmath50 is an image position that is not on the critical curve .",
    "then , @xmath157 and @xmath158 , and thus , the integral along the small circle @xmath159 ( @xmath160 ) around @xmath50 reduces to @xmath161 and can be evaluated as the limiting value for @xmath162 .",

    "similarly , for a pole @xmath168 of @xmath29 of order @xmath125 , by factoring out the diverging part , it is possible to write @xmath169 where @xmath170 is non - zero finite and @xmath171 .",
    "consequently , the integral along the small circle around the pole @xmath172 ( @xmath173 ) is given as @xmath174 the limiting value of which as @xmath162 is @xmath175 , assuming @xmath176 is finite .",

    "however , for a large enough contour @xmath182 , the integral can also be evaluated using a contour around the point at infinity @xmath183 the limiting result as @xmath184 is dependent on the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath29 as @xmath185 . if @xmath186 is finite , using the asymptotic expansion form @xmath187 where @xmath188 and @xmath189 are constants ( @xmath188 may be nil ) and @xmath125 is a positive integer , the integral reduces to @xmath190 on the other hand , if @xmath29 diverges at least quadratically , that is @xmath191 with @xmath192 and @xmath193 , then @xmath194 finally , if @xmath195 ( @xmath193 ) diverges linearly , then @xmath196 by summarizing the results , we arrive at a relation for the difference between the numbers of positive and negative parity images @xmath197 where @xmath125 is the ramification index of @xmath29 at @xmath116 . since @xmath29 is a rational function , if @xmath29 diverges as @xmath198",
    ", @xmath125 is the same as the asymptotic power index of @xmath29 , which must be an integer for this case .",
    "furthermore , @xmath181 is in fact the same as the order of the polynomial in the denominator when @xmath29 is expressed as a quotient of relative prime polynomials .",
    "since the asymptotic power index for a rational function is basically the difference of the orders of those polynomials , and the degree of the rational function is the larger of two , we find that @xmath199 if @xmath29 is divergent as @xmath185 .",
    "this result is in fact the extension of the so - called index theorem @xcite to the case when the deflection function is given by a rational function .",
    "the fact that @xmath200 is a fixed number for given @xmath29 , in particular , being independent of @xmath43 , further implies that for a given lens system , change of source position can only create or destroy images of opposite parity in a pair .",
    "the upper limit on the total number of non - infinite images can be directly found from the limit on @xmath145 using @xmath201 .",
    "the final result on the limits of number of images for a number of rational lens maps are summarized in table [ tni ] .    comparing the upper limit on the number of images to the degree of the imaging equation @xmath202 , which is either @xmath203 if @xmath29 diverges as @xmath185 or @xmath204 if otherwise , we find that they can be same only if @xmath205 or @xmath206 [ i.e. , @xmath207 .",
    "if @xmath29 is a non - degenerate mbius transformation , that is , a degree-1 rational function , explicit calculations can establish that the imaging equation reduces to either a linear equation if @xmath29 is a linear polynomial , or a quadratic equation if otherwise , with all of its solutions yielding image locations .",
    "in other words , the imaging equation must have solutions that are not image locations if @xmath208 .",
    "this also indicates that the moment sum invariants that may be derived through the similar methods as in section [ sec : pmm ] will be valid only if the degree of the rational deflection function is 1 , 2 , or 3 , since , if otherwise , there must be spurious roots .",
    "as noted in section [ sec : pc ] , the ratio of the areas under the caustics and the pre - caustics gives the mean magnification for the source inside the caustics .",
