    "it is notable that , observations of the ligo collaboration could be employed to test the validation of einstein theory of the gravity or the necessity of modified theories of gravity @xcite .",
    "einstein theory of gravity may have some problems in describing gravity accurately at all scales .",
    "one of the problems that general relativity faced was that , it could nt describe the accelerated expansion of the universe accurately @xcite .",
    "also , it is consistent with neither mach s principle nor dirac s large number hypothesis @xcite .",
    "herein , cosmologists explored various alternatives for gravitational fields clifton , fr .",
    "the pioneers of studying on scalar - tensor theory were done by brans and dicke @xcite .",
    "this theory accommodates both mach s principle and dirac s large number hypothesis @xcite .",
    "scientists have investigated various aspects of black holes and gravitational collapse in brans - dicke ( bd ) theory due to their importance in both classical and quantum aspects of gravity @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the stationary and vacuum bd solution in @xmath0dimensions is just the kerr solution with a trivial scalar field everywhere @xcite .",
    "cai and myung showed that in @xmath0dimensions the bd - maxwell ( bdm ) solution is just the reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) solution with a constant scalar field cai .",
    "however in higher dimensions , due to the fact that the action of maxwell field is not invariant under conformal transformation and the stress energy tensor of maxwell field is not traceless , the solution of bdm is rn solution with a nontrivial scalar field .    on the other hand , the black hole thermodynamics has been the field of interest for many researchers since the work of hawking @xcite . recently , in most treatments of black hole thermodynamics , physicists have considered the cosmological constant @xmath1 as a dynamical variable @xcite .",
    "furthermore , some authors suggested to treat @xmath2 as a thermodynamic variable @xcite , such as thermodynamical pressure @xcite .",
    "one of the interesting aspects of the black hole thermodynamics is their stability . in order to have a black hole in thermal stability",
    ", its heat capacity must be positive .",
    "in other words , positivity of the heat capacity guarantees thermal stability of the black holes .",
    "this approach of studying the stability is in the context of the canonical ensemble . studying the heat capacity of a system",
    "also provides a mechanism to study the phase transitions of that system .",
    "there are two distinctive points : in one point , changing in the sign of the heat capacity is denoted as a physical limitation point and therefore , the root of the heat capacity is a border between non - physical and physical black hole solutions . other characterized points are related to divergencies of the heat capacity .",
    "we identify these points as second order phase transitions @xcite .    in the past few decades , applying the thermodynamical geometry for studying the phase transition of black holes has gained lots of attentions .",
    "these studies were pioneered by weinhold @xcite and ruppeiner ruppeiner .",
    "weinhold introduced a metric on the space of equilibrium state and defined the metric tensor as the second derivatives of internal energy with respect to entropy and other extensive quantities . on the other hand ,",
    "the metric that ruppeiner introduced was defined as the minus second derivatives of entropy with respect to internal energy and other extensive quantities , which was conformal to weinhold s metric @xcite . however , applying these treatments to study black hole thermodynamics caused some puzzling anomalies .",
    "neither weinhold nor ruppeiner metrics were invariant under legendre transformation .",
    "a few years ago , quevedo quevedo proposed an approach to obtain a metric which was legendre invariant in the space of equilibrium state .",
    "his work was based on the observation in which standard thermodynamics was invariant with respect to legendre transformation .",
    "the formalism of geometrothermodynamics ( gtd ) indicates that phase transition occurs at points where the thermodynamics curvature is singular , as a consequence , the curvature can be interpreted as a measure of thermodynamics interaction .",
    "after quevedo , interesting studies were followed by some authors @xcite .",
    "recently , it was pointed out that using the mentioned approaches toward gtd may sometimes confront with some problems . in order to overcome these problems ,",

    "these regions are specified by the root and two divergencies of the heat capacity . in case of root of the heat capacity",
    ", there was a limitation point between non - physical black holes and physical ones . between two divergencies , it was an unstable state and after the larger divergency it acquired stable state .",
    "in other words , in smaller divergency black hole may go under phase transition from unstable state with larger horizon radius to smaller stable black hole , whereas , in case of larger divergency system went under another phase transition and stabilized with larger horizon radius .",
    "finally , we used the geometrical thermodynamics for studying phase transitions of the system .",
    "it was shown that the divergencies of the curvature scalar of the hpem metric exactly coincide with both physical limitation point and phase transitions of the heat capacity .",
    "in other words , divergencies of the heat capacity and its root are matched with divergencies of the ricci scalar .",
    "it was also shown unlike rn - ads black holes @xcite ( in the absence of dilaton field ) , employing weinhold , ruppeiner and quevedo metrics failed to provide effective results for bd black hole solutions .",
    "it is notable that the behavior of the ricci scalar around its divergence points for root and phase transitions was different .",
    "it means that , there were characteristic behaviors that enable one to recognize divergence point of ricci scalar related to root of the heat capacity from divergence points of @xmath8 related to divergencies of @xmath128 .",
    "therefore , one is able to point out that physical limitation point and phase transitions took place in the divergencies of thermodynamical ricci scalar of the hpem metric with different distinctive behaviors .",
    "in addition , the free energy of these black holes has been investigated as well .",
    "it was shown that free energy enjoys extrema in its diagrams versus horizon radius .",
    "these extrema were located exactly where temperature acquires extrema and heat capacity diverges .",
    "it was pointed out that divergencies that are observed in heat capacity are places where black holes go under second order phase transition .",
    "we would like to thank the referees for their constructive comments .",
    "we also thank the shiraz university research council .",
    "this work has been supported financially by the research institute for astronomy and astrophysics of maragha , iran ."
