    "modern instrumentation has provided us with two techniques capable of identifying high redshift ( @xmath10 ) galaxies in relatively large numbers .",
    "direct detection of star - forming galaxies via deep multi - color imaging employs broad band photometry in filters which span characteristic continuum breaks ( e.g. steidel et al .",
    "1996 ; lowenthal et al . 1997 ; giavalisco 2002 ; adelberger et al .",
    "a complementary approach uses spectroscopy of distant qsos whose lines of sight penetrate intervening gas clouds associated with galaxies and the intergalactic medium ( e.g. wolfe et al . 1986 ) .",
    "these two techniques occupy different astrophysical niches ; the former identifies the brightest , most actively star forming galaxies at early epochs ( e.g. sawicki & yee 1998 ; shapley et al . 2001 ; nandra et al .",
    "2002 ) whereas the latter selects galaxies via their absorption cross section of neutral hydrogen .",
    "in particular , damped  systems ( dlas ) are often proclaimed to be ` unbiased ' tracers of galaxy evolution and are expected to provide a fair census of neutral gas at all redshifts . however , despite the lack of malmquist bias , dla statistics are susceptible to other possible selection effects .",
    "for example , dust in intervening galaxies may cause significant extinction of background sources which would make dusty absorbers more difficult to detect in optical surveys .",
    "obfuscation of background qsos is also theoretically supported ( ostriker & heisler 1984 ; fall & pei 1993 ; masci & webster 1995 ) and often invoked as an explanation for observed trends such as the anti - correlation between the neutral hydrogen column density , @xmath11 ( ) , and metallicity ( e.g. prantzos & boissier 2000 ) .",
    "however , murphy & liske ( 2004 ) have recently determined @xmath12 values of less than 0.01 magnitudes ( assuming an smc extinction curve ) for dlas in the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "selection against evolved galaxies may also be responsible for the lack of metallicity evolution ( pettini et al .",
    "1999 ) in dlas .",
    "if it is shown that dust obscuration is not an important effect , then we must appeal to alternative explanations for these observed trends .    in order to specifically address the issue of dust biasing in dla surveys , we have designed the complete optical and radio absorption line system survey ( corals ) .",
    "corals is based on a sample of radio - selected quasars ( jackson et al . 2002 ) with complete optical identifications .",
    "the key here is that qso selection was executed at a wavelength immune to extinction , and yet optical counterparts have been identified for every target .",
    "the high redshift ( @xmath13 ) results of corals  i",
    "( ellison et al . 2001 ) indicate that the effect of dust bias at this redshift is relatively minor , although a larger radio selected sample would be desirable to improve the statistics .",
    "these results do not indicate that dust is entirely absent in high redshift dlas . on the contrary",
    ", there is evidence from a number of observations including chemical abundances , ( pettini et al .",
    "1997 ) , qso colors and spectral indices ( pei , fall & bechtold 1991 ; outram et al .",
    "2001 ) and lyman break galaxies ( sawicki & yee 1998 ; shapley et al . 2003 ) that dust is present at these early times .",
    "apparently extinction in the majority of gas - rich galaxies at @xmath14 has only a minor effect on the statistics of qso surveys with optical magnitude limits @xmath15 .    at low redshift",
    ", however , the story may be quite different .",
    "the most prominent sources of dust today are the envelopes of evolved , cool , stars which can be distributed into the ism by winds . however , in order to explain the large amounts of dust already present at high redshift ( e.g. priddey & mcmahon 2001 ; bertoldi et al .",
    "2003 ) , additional sources such as supernovae ( morgan & edmunds 2003 ; dunne et al . 2003 ) and agn ( elvis , marengo & karovska 2002 ) have been proposed , although our understanding of dust formation at any epoch remains sketchy .",
    "regardless of the source of dust , it seems plausible that stars ( and possibly agn ) must be well established before grains can be distributed in the ism .",
    "the epoch around @xmath16  3 is emerging as an important formative stage in the universe s history , with both star formation and qso space density declining steeply after this time ( madau et al .",
    "1996 ; shaver et al .",
    "moreover , dickinson et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and rudnick et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have shown that this is the epoch when stellar mass sees marked evolution ; only about 5  10% of galactic stellar mass is apparently in place before a redshift of 2.5 , but 50  75% at @xmath17 .",
    "models of chemical evolution also predict a more serious dust bias at low redshift",
    "( e.g. masci & webster 1999 ; churches , nelson & edmunds 2004 ) . moreover , our only direct evidence of spectral dust features seen in absorption is at @xmath18 .",
    "malhotra ( 1997 ) found evidence for the 2175   absorption feature in a composite of 96  systems with an average redshift of @xmath19 .",
    "the same feature has also recently been identified in a @xmath20 dla ( junkkarinen et al .",
    "2004 ) and in a @xmath21 lensing galaxy ( motta et al . 2002 ) .",
    "no evidence for this extinction feature has been found at higher redshift ( fall , pei & mcmahon 1989 ) .",
    "this clearly highlights the need to quantify the dust bias at @xmath22 .    in order to extend the corals  i survey to lower redshifts where dust bias may be more pronounced ,",
    "we have executed a complementary follow - up survey . in this paper , we present the results of this survey which targets absorption systems primarily in the range @xmath23 , once again utilizing an optically complete radio - selected sample of qsos . a survey for strong systems is a stepping stone towards the quantification of dust bias in dlas , which form a subset of the systems discovered here .",
    "future follow - up observations with the hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) will allow us to confirm the column densities of the candidate dlas discovered by corals and determine unbiased statistics for this population at intermediate redshifts .",
    "we describe the design of the survey (  2 ) , the observations (  3 ) and tabulate the absorption systems identified (  4 ) .",
    "we present our absorption line statistics in  5 and  6 .",
    "discussion and conclusions can be found in  7 and  8 respectively .",
    "the original corals  i sample selected all qsos with @xmath24 from the parkes 0.25  jy flat spectrum sample of jackson et al .",
    "we imposed this lower redshift bound because our survey was limited to dlas at @xmath25 . for dlas at lower redshifts ,",
    "the line occurs at a wavelength where the throughput of most spectrographs drops significantly and at @xmath26  falls bluewards of the atmospheric cut - off , completely precluding ground - based detection .",
    "since  observations with the _ hst _ for an optically complete sample are not feasible due to its limited aperture , we adopted an alternative strategy for our low redshift corals survey ( corals  ii ) .",
    "based on the approach of rao & turnshek ( 2000 , rt00 ) , we selected systems with large rest equivalent widths ( ews ) of  @xmath27 and @xmath28 as candidate dlas .",
    "these metal lines can be efficiently observed in ground - based optical spectra over the range @xmath29 .",
    "we can assess the severity of dust bias in previous surveys by determining the number of  systems , as well as the statistically inferred number of dlas .    in order to extend the corals survey to lower redshifts using ,",
    "it is necessary to re - define the original qso sample so that it is optimized for this task .",
    "moreover , the observations from corals  i are not suitable for the identification of moderate redshift  for two reasons .",
    "first , we must target the continuum redward of  whereas the wavelength range of corals  i spectra often covers only the  forest .",
    "second , the corals  i spectra were of insufficient resolution and signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) for consistent identification of the  doublet ( a minimum resolving power @xmath30 is required in order to resolve the mg  ii @xmath31 doublet ) .",
    "thus , for the present corals  ii survey we have selected all sources with @xmath32 from the parent sample of 0.25 jy parkes flat spectrum qsos .",
    "the high systemic redshift cut - off was selected so that even for the lowest redshift mg  ii systems ( typically @xmath33 ) the  @xmath342796 , 2803   doublet was always located redwards of emission .",
    "although the corresponding lower systemic redshift cut - off could have consequently extended to @xmath35 , this would have yielded an unmanageble number of survey sightlines given observational facilities at our disposal .",
    "the lower redshift cut - off was therefore set to @xmath36 , resulting in a sample of 75 qsos .",
    "spectra were obtained with a variety of instruments on 4- to 8-m telescopes : isis ( william herschel telescope ) , efosc2 ( eso 3.6-m ) , the boller & chivens ( b&c ; magellan - baade ) and fors1 ( vlt ut3 ) .",
    "all observations executed at the vlt were obtained in service mode .",
    "a summary of the observation dates and instrumental setups is given in table [ obs_table ] . in table",
    "[ qso_table ] we list the observed qsos , exposure times , magnitudes and redshifts .",
    "the transparency conditions were generally clear to photometric and seeing ranged from approximately 0.5 to 1.5 arcsec .",
    "for efosc2 , b&c and isis , the slit was aligned at the parallactic angle at the start of each observation ; for fors1 we used the atmospheric dispersion corrector .",
    "all but two of the 75 qsos in our sample have been observed , availability of telescope time precluding the observation of two of our faintest targets .",
    "although the main objective of this survey is to achieve optical completeness , the exclusion of two sightlines is extremely unlikely to affect our number density statistics .",
    "the data were reduced using standard iraf routines to execute the usual corrections for flat fields and bias structure .",
    "we note that efosc2 has a very narrow overscan strip ( @xmath37 6 pixels ) that could not be used , so that only the average bias frame was subtracted .",
    "special attention was paid to the flat fielding of the isis spectra where significant structure is introduced by the dichroic response , by vignetting on the new large format red arm ccd ( applicable to the october 2002 data ) , and by interference patterns at red wavelengths .",
    "the spectra were optimally extracted and wavelength calibrated using hear ( efosc2 ) , cuar+cune ( isis ) , hearne ( b&c ) or henearcdhg ( fors1 ) lamps . in the case of fors1 and efosc2 , the instrument flexure is minimal and arcs were obtained only at the start and the end of each night . for isis and the b&c spectrographs , arcs were taken before or after each science target .",
    "although the observing conditions did not allow precise absolute flux determination , the intrinsic continuum shape has been recovered by flux calibrating with spectrophotometric standards taken through the night .",
    "the calibrated spectra were then combined and shifted to a vacuum heliocentric reference frame .",
    "finally , a correction for galactic interstellar reddening was applied assuming the empirical selective extinction function of cardelli , clayton & mathis ( 1989 ) and e(b@xmath38v ) values taken from the dirbe extinction maps of schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) with an assumed @xmath39=3.1 . in figure [ spec_fig ]",
    "we present examples of the spectra obtained for this project from each telescope utilized .",
    "the search for  @xmath34 2796 , 2803 doublets was undertaken using an automated search algorithm based on the technique originally designed for identification of absorption lines in the @xmath40 qso key project spectra ( schneider et al .",
    "we have refined this technique ; full details can be found in churchill et al ( 2000a ) . here",
    "we give only a brief qualitative summary of the steps involved .",
    "for each flux spectrum , we calculated an ew and an ew uncertainty spectrum .",
    "the ew uncertainty spectrum provides a running detection limit as a function of wavelength ( e.g. , schneider et al .",
    "1993 ; churchill et al .",
    "these spectra are produced by assuming an unresolved line centered on each pixel with weighting of neighbouring pixels by the appropriate instrumental spread function . using these spectra , we ran an automated routine to objectively locate candidate  doublets . during this automated process , a preliminary measurement of the equivalent widths and the  doublet ratio is computed , again assuming unresolved absorption features .",
    "the objectively determined candidate doublet list is then visually inspected using the flux spectra to ascertain which are _ bona fide",
    "_  doublets .",
    "many candidates were corroborated by the detection of one or several lines and the @xmath41 line .",
    "following visual inspection , roughly 10% of the candidates were discarded .",
    "we also visually inspected the flux spectra to search for  candidates that may have been missed in the automated search .",
    "we found no candidates missed by the search algorithm .",
    "we then interactively fitted gaussian profiles to the absorption lines using a @xmath42 minization routine to determine the final ews and redshifts ( line centers ) , and their uncertainties ( churchill et al .",
    "for unresolved lines , the gaussian width was automatically held at the instrumental spread function width .",
    "in the few cases of highly resolved lines , multiple gaussians were used to determine the ews .",
    "the systems were again inspected to confirm that the redshifts of the @xmath43 and @xmath44 lines were consistent within 1  @xmath8 and that they had physically meaningful doublet ratios within the uncertainties . for each system",
    ", we then performed gaussian fitting on statistically significant and transitions , or computed the 3  @xmath8 ew limit for an unresolved feature from the ew uncertainty spectrum at the expected location of the line . the full list of  systems and their  @xmath43 and  @xmath28   ews is given in table [ line_table ] .",
    "the advantage of our line detection algorithm is that it computes the effective detection limit at each resolution element , allowing us to easily calculate the survey coverage as a function of ew threshold .",
    "the redshift path density for a given ew threshold , @xmath45 , is the number of lines of sight in our survey at which a  doublet of rest equivalent width @xmath46 at redshift @xmath47 could have been detected :    @xmath48\\ ] ]    for @xmath49 qsos in the survey .",

    "we plot @xmath45 for our survey , adopting three ew thresholds : @xmath53 0.3 , 0.6 and 1.0   ( 5 @xmath8 ) .",
    "this figure illustrates that for the range @xmath54 we are almost 100% complete ( except at @xmath55 due to a gap in the wavelength coverage of the isis spectra ) for @xmath46=0.6 , 1.0    and about 50% complete for a threshold ew limit of 0.3  .    the total redshift path , @xmath6 , of the survey is given by    @xmath56    in figure [ dz ] we plot the total redshift path as a function of ew limit for both 3 and 5 @xmath8 detection limits .",
    "corresponding values of @xmath6 are listed in table [ dz_table ] for various combinations of @xmath46 and detection significance as a supplement to the information in figure [ dz ] .",
    "dz_table ] additionally includes redshift coverage values for simultaneous detection of  @xmath43 and  @xmath28 ; this point will be discussed in  [ dla_sec ] .",
    "the number density of absorbers per unit redshift , @xmath0 , is computed for a given mean absorption redshift by dividing the number of systems by @xmath6 . in table",
    "[ stats ] we present the values of @xmath6 and number of absorbers for corals  ii , as well as the large surveys of steidel & sargent ( 1992 , ss92 ) and rt00 .",
    "figure [ nz ] compares the @xmath0 determined for corals  ii and other surveys as a function of redshift .",
    "we use the statistics of ss92 for @xmath57   and preliminary statistics from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) early data release ( @xmath58  , nestor et al .",
    "since corals is a smaller survey than the sdss or ss92 and evolution in the number density is very mild over the redshift range that we cover , we combine our @xmath0 statistics into one redshift bin .",
    "the results in figure [ nz ] demonstrate an excellent agreement between the corals value of @xmath0 and that determined from the sdss survey of nestor et al .",
    "the sdss results for the intermediate ew threshold of 0.6   ( nestor et al . in preparation ) are also in excellent agreement with the corals value . in the lower ew range , @xmath57 ",
    ", there is marginal evidence for a higher number density ( at most a factor of two ) in the corals sample compared with ss92 .",
    "if this is interpreted within the framework of a dust bias , we would conclude that the weakest systems are more prone to extinction than high ew systems .",
    "this seems unlikely given that a ) the lowest ew systems are likely to be associated with the outer regions of galaxies ( e.g. churchill et al .",
    "2000b ; ellison et al .",
    "2004 ) and b ) strong systems statistically trace gas with higher metallicities than weak systems ( nestor et al .",
    "2003b ) . in any case , figure [ nz ] illustrates the main result of this survey : previous magnitude limited surveys have not under - estimated the number density of systems in the range @xmath59 .",
    "although the principal focus of the corals survey has been the quantification of dust bias , we consider here also the potential effect of gravitational lensing .",
    "the possibility that an amplification bias can skew distant source counts has been discussed extensively in the literature ( e.g. turner 1980 ; schneider 1987 ; hamana et al .",
    "1997 ) . amongst others , bartelmann & loeb ( 1996 ) , smette et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and perna , loeb & bartelmann ( 1997 ) have discussed the specific case of amplification bias in qso absorption system surveys .",
    "these papers describe the dual effect of magnification of the background source and deflection of the sightline from the central part of the lensing galaxy .",
    "however , since the observational spotlight has focussed in large part on the detection of _ high redshift _ dlas , little concern has been directed towards this possible bias , since lensing becomes less efficient as the redshift of the intervening galaxy approaches that of the qso . only in the last few years",
    "have large numbers of low redshift dlas been discovered and studied , renewing interest in the potential effect of the amplification bias .",
    "le brun et al .",
    "( 2000 ) studied 7 qsos with @xmath60 dlas . in no case",
    "did they find multiple images and they therefore concluded that amplification of the sources was at most 0.3 magnitudes .",
    "however , these authors also noted that these qsos are fainter than those in many low redshift dla surveys and are therefore less likely to be affected by amplification bias . using a large sample of 2df qsos , menard & proux ( 2003 , mp03 )",
    "have reported the first convincing evidence of amplification bias by showing that bright qsos ( @xmath61 ) are more likely to have intervening absorbers than fainter ones",
    ". however , proux et al . (",
    "2004 ) have also shown that gravitational lensing bias has no demonstrable effect on the total column density of intervening gas and the mass fraction of neutral gas in low redshift absorbers .    in figure [ mag_ratio ]",
    "we reproduce an analogous plot to figure 5 of mp03 and confirm qualitatively their result : there is an excess of bright qsos with absorbers . excluding from our least squares",
    "fit the brightest magnitude bin which has a large error because of small number statistics , we find a slope of @xmath62 .",
    "this gradient is somewhat shallower than the value @xmath63 found by mp03 , although these authors also show that the slope is quite sensitive to the band selected .",
    "in order to understand this dependence on magnitude , it is important to consider the shape of the optical luminosity function ( olf ) of qsos . if the quasar olf were a single power law , then absorber number statistics should be independent of survey depth , _ even in the presence of dust or lensing bias_. a bias due to dust or lensing would alter the @xmath0 determined , with a severity dictated by the steepness of the lf , but one would not observe a varying effect as a function of completeness magnitude .",
    "however , at all redshifts the quasar olf is well modelled by a double power law with a steep index at bright magnitudes and a considerably shallower slope at fainter magnitudes , the turnover depending on the qso redshift e.g. ( boyle et al .",
    "2000 ; although see hunt et al .",
    "2004 for evidence of evolution in the faint end slope at high redshift ) .",
    "it is the transition between ` bright ' and ` faint ' qsos that causes the magnitude dependent effect seen in figure [ mag_ratio ] ( and in figure 5 of mp03 ) .",
    "the negative slope of the fit in figure [ mag_ratio ] indicates that gravitational lensing bias dominates over extinction effects for bright qsos with intermediate redshift absorbers , as predicted by perna et al .",
    "however , the wavelength dependent nature of this effect , which is more apparent in red filters ( mp03 ) , indicates that dust also makes a contribution . in theory",
    ", we can disentangle the effects of dust and lensing by looking at the ratio of qsos with and without intervening absorbers ( as shown in figure [ mag_ratio ] ) as a function of radio luminosity , since lensing is achromatic , but dust extinction is not .",
    "however , unlike the olf , the quasar radio luminosity function for flat spectrum sources at @xmath64 does not show a convincing break ( j. wall , 2004 , private communication ) .",
    "we therefore do not expect to find ( and indeed do not find ) a smooth variation in the ratio of qso numbers with / without intervening absorbers as a function of radio power .",
    "an alternative explanation for the effect seen in figure [ mag_ratio ] is that higher s / n in the spectra of brighter qsos facilitates the detection of absorbers towards these sources . in order to test this possibility",
    "we have compared the ratio of qsos with and without intervening absorbers with @xmath65  .",
    "since we are effectively complete at this ew limit ( see figure [ gz ] ) imposing this cut should remove any bias due to s / n .",
    "the results of this test are shown in figure [ mag_ratio2 ] , where it can be seen that the ` signature ' of lensing bias seen in figure [ mag_ratio ] vanishes .",
    "clearly , more investigation into gravitational lensing bias with larger qso samples and with careful quantification of completeness is warranted .",
    "we conclude this section by emphasizing that although the discussion above acknowledges the possible existence of observational biases from dust and lensing , both appear to be relatively minor effects . moreover , due to the change in the slope of the qso olf at @xmath66 , surveys which have magnitude limits significantly fainter than this fiducial value will not yield absorber statistics which depend on qso brightness .",
    "in fact , the relatively shallow olf slope at faint magnitudes means that moderate dust ( or gravitational lensing bias ) will have only a small effect and will not yield number densities significantly different from complete surveys such as corals .",
    "the ultimate aim of this work is to quantify the obscuration bias associated with dlas , which form a subset of the strong absorbers identified here .",
    "although we can not make definitive statements concerning dla statistics until _ hst _ observations are in hand , we can speculate upon their number density based on the selection statistics of previous surveys .",
    "rt00 have shown that low redshift dlas can be efficiently pre - selected for uv follow - up based on the ews of strong metal lines .",
    "specifically , they found in their sample of 87  systems that 50% of absorbers with ew ( @xmath672600 , @xmath672796 ) @xmath68 0.5   were confirmed to be dlas based on _ hst _ spectroscopy .",
    "recently , proux et al ( 2004 ) have investigated whether this pre - selection introduces a bias into dla surveys , but found no convincing evidence that this is the case . in the absence of direct information on the  of our  absorbers",
    ", we therefore adopt the rt00 pre - selection as an indication of dla statistics .",
    "our survey has been designed specifically with this pre - selection in mind . in figure [ gz_fe ]",
    "we show the @xmath69 of our sample if we include the additional criterion of @xmath672600 coverage .",
    "figure [ gz_fe ] is therefore analogous to figure [ gz ] except that the minimum ew thresholds now apply to both transitions .",
    "a comparison of the two figures shows that we achieve simultaneous coverage of these two metal lines for the majority of sightlines .",
    "there is a small ( @xmath70 ) gap in coverage at the lowest redshift end which is unavoidable , simply because the rest wavelength of is bluer than that of .",
    "there is a second small dip in @xmath69 at @xmath71 caused by the gap in ccd coverage in the isis instrument ( there is a corresponding gap for  at @xmath72 ) .    in figure [ dla_cand ]",
    "we show the  and rest frame ews for every system in our catalogue ( table [ line_table ] ) .",
    "in addition we plot the @xmath672852 ew as a function of @xmath672796 ew ; rt00 find that all systems with ew(@xmath73 0.7   are confirmed to be dlas .",
    "based on  and alone , we have 14 good dla candidates , six of which have ew ( @xmath73 0.7  . according to the results of rt00",
    ", we would statistically expect 50% of the 14 candidates to be confirmed as dlas .",
    "we can re - calculate the redshift path incorporating coverage for a given sigma and ew limit in order to calculate @xmath0 for the dlas ; these values are given in table [ dz_table ] .",
    "we have calculated @xmath74 for dlas by assuming 7 absorption systems in the range @xmath75 and @xmath6=44.62 ( at 5 sigma significance for a 0.5   detection ) , i.e. n(z)=0.16@xmath76 .",
    "the average absorption redshift of the 14 systems with ew(@xmath43 , @xmath77 0.5   is @xmath78 . in figure [ nz_dla ]",
    "we compare this value with previous dla surveys at high ( storrie - lombardi & wolfe 2000 ) and low redshifts ( rt00 ) .",
    "we additionally include the @xmath79 number density from rosenberg & schneider ( 2003 ) which is in good agreement with other local studies such as those by ryan - weber et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and zwaan et al .",
    "we conclude that the number density of dlas expected statistically in our sample is consistent with that from previous surveys based on optically selected samples .",
    "however , the small number of inferred systems ( which needs to be confirmed with uv spectroscopy ) leads to large ( 1@xmath8 ) error bars which permit up to a factor of 2.5 difference with previous dla surveys .",
    "one of the outstanding questions concerning dlas is why their metallicities remain low ( @xmath80 ) , even at low - to - intermediate redshifts ( e.g. pettini et al .",
    "it has previously been speculated ( e.g. pei & fall 1995 ; pettini et al .",
    "1999 ; prantzos & boissier 2000 ; churches et al . 2004 ) that dust bias could cause an artificial cut - off in the observed metallicities .",
    "akerman et al .",
    "( in preparation ) have found that this is not the case at high redshift : the mean metallicity of @xmath14 dlas from corals  i is in agreement with that in optically selected samples .",
    "we can attempt a crude comparison of metallicities between dla candidates in our survey and those in an optically selected sample , namely the sdss .",
    "nestor et al . (",
    "2003b ) have found that the mean metallicity ( based on [ zn / h ] in composite spectra ) of their sdss  sample was higher for larger ew  systems .",
    "we therefore compare the median  ew from our survey with that determined from the sdss sample .",
    "nestor et al ( 2003a ) provisionally fit the ew distribution with an exponential of the form    @xmath81    with a value of @xmath82  .",
    "this value is in very good agreement with the previous determination of @xmath83 by ss92 , who also give an alternative formulation of    @xmath84    with a value of @xmath85 , which we adopt here .",
    "( [ n_eqn ] ) we determine a median value of the ew that depends on the minimum and maximum cut - offs adopted :    @xmath86    applying to our corals  ii sample the minimum ew cut - off of nestor et al .",
    "( 2003b ) , ew=1  , we measure a value of @xmath87 = 1.50  , in good agreement with the theoretical median of 1.57   determined from eq .",
    "( [ med_eqn ] ) , adopting the maximum @xmath88    found in our sample .",
    "this good correspondence between the median equivalent widths of the corals  ii and sdss  samples further suggests that the typical metallicity of low redshift corals absorbers is unlikely to be significantly higher than that of absorbers from optically selected qso samples .",
    "however , only a fraction of dlas will have sufficiently large  and high metallicities to cause severe obscuration ; cen et al .",
    "( 2003 ) estimate a fraction of @xmath37 10% . since our statistics are based on only 7 dlas , such a small sample of candidate dlas is unlikely to sample the full metallicity distribution function .",
    "we have performed a new survey for  absorption systems in the range @xmath89 from a radio selected quasar sample with complete optical identifications .",
    "the strongest of these  systems , particularly those with accompanying absorption , are good candidates for dlas . we have used these data to quantify , for the first time , the effect of dust bias on the completeness of optically selected surveys for low redshift  systems .",
    "our most robust result is that the number density of  systems is in excellent agreement with previous studies based on optically selected qsos .",
    "combined with the result of our high redshift survey ( ellison et al .",
    "2001 ) , we have not yet found any evidence for a statistically significant dust bias in absorption system surveys over the range @xmath90 .    at bright magnitudes ( @xmath91 )",
    "we observe a mild excess of qsos with intervening low redshift absorbers which may be due to gravitational lensing bias .",
    "however , this excess is not present when only absorbers with @xmath92   are included , indicating that incompleteness may be at least partly responsible .",
    "our discussion of gravitational lensing bias and its dependence on the shape of the qso olf highlights an important conclusion for absorption line surveys : an optical completeness fainter the fiducial point in the olf ( @xmath66 ) will not yield number densities that are dependent on qso magnitude .    using the empirical pre - selection technique of rao & turnshek ( 2000 ) we have attempted to estimate the number of dlas in our sample and hence their number density . by assuming that 50% of absorbers with ew ( @xmath672600 , @xmath672796 ) @xmath68 0.5 ",
    "are statistically likely to be confirmed as dlas , we determine the dla number density at @xmath78 to be @xmath9 .",
    "this is consistent with previous estimates of @xmath0 at this redshift , but the large 1@xmath8 error bars permit up to a factor of 2.5 difference .",
    "the number density relies both on an empirical pre - selection and relatively small number statistics and should therefore be confirmed with follow - up observations of the  transition .",
    "finally , the median equivalent width of the corals  ii  systems is in good agreement with that of optically selected absorbers in the sdss .",
    "this is suggestive of consistent metallicities between the two samples , since nestor et al .",
    "( 2003b ) find that larger ew  systems have higher metallicities in their sdss composites .",
    "the next important step is to measure the  of our candidate dlas .",
    "this will permit us to calculate the neutral gas mass density of our complete low redshift sample and allow us to determine metallicities with ground - based telescopes .",
    "once we have determined the  of these systems , there are several foreseeable follow - up projects , such as 21  cm absorption measurements which will yield spin temperatures for the absorbing galaxies .",
    "the few measurements of spin temperature that have already been obtained hint at some intriguing trends ( e.g. kanekar & chengalur 2003 ) , but there is an absence of data points in the important range @xmath93 .",
    "such follow - up programs will build on the uniqueness of corals and exploit fully the benefits of this radio - selected sample .",
    "we are extremely grateful to remi cabanac who performed the march 2001 efosc2 run for us and to paul green and john silverman for the opportunity to obtain several spectra at the baade telescope at las campanas observatory .",
    "we thank dan nestor for providing the sdss determinations of @xmath0 in advance of publication and arif babul and jon willis for useful discussions on gravitational lensing .",
