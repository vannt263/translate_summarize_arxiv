    "in the past two decades a handful of stars with heavy element abundance less than 1/1000 that of the sun ( [ fe / h ] = log  ( n@xmath3/n@xmath4)@xmath5log  ( n@xmath6/n@xmath4)@xmath2 ] @xmath8 3.0 ) have been analyzed at high spectral resolution , with a view to understanding the production of the elements at the earliest times .",
    "such stars have the potential to constrain big bang nucleosynthesis ( ryan , norris & beers 1999 ) , the nature of the first supernovae ( mcwilliam et al .",
    "1995 ; ryan , norris & beers 1996 ; nakamura et al .",

    "the most metal - poor objects are generally faint , and studies to date have been undertaken with somewhat limited signal - to - noise ( s / n ) . for the six stars having [ fe / h ] @xmath8 3.5 and so far analyzed at high resolution ( see table 6 of ryan et al .",
    "1996 ) , perusal of the sources suggests that the data were obtained with a representative s / n per equivalent 0.04  pixel of roughly 30 , corresponding to a 3@xmath11 detection limit for weak lines of @xmath1  10 m . in some cases this has led to uncertainty as to the existence of important elements in these objects245 are rather discordant , ranging from detection at 18 m and 19 m ( bessell & norris 1984 ; primas et al . 1994 ) to upper limits @xmath8  10 m and @xmath8  7 m by molaro & castelli ( 1990 ) and peterson & carney ( 1989 ) .

    "as one moves to the lowest abundances ( or higher temperatures ) , the problem of determining reliable abundances can only deteriorate : for example , in the two near - main - sequence - turnoff dwarfs in the above - mentioned sample there are fewer than 20 non - fe lines detected in the preferred wavelength range ( 37004700  ) , of which fewer than half are stronger than 20 m .",
    "to improve the accuracy of the existing abundance analyses we are attempting to obtain high resolution ( r = 40,000 ) data with s / n = 100 of objects with [ fe / h ] @xmath8 3.5 .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to present results for cs  22876032 . in a subsequent paper",
    "we shall present results for cd24@xmath1217504 , cd38@xmath12245 , cs  22172002 , and cs  22885096 .",
    "cs  22876032 was discovered by beers , preston , & shectman ( 1985 ) , and with a high - resolution abundance determination of [ fe / h ] = 4.3 ( molaro & castelli 1990 ; norris , peterson , & beers 1993 ) it is currently the most metal - poor dwarf for which such analysis exists .",
    "the abundance determinations for this object are , however , compromised to some extent by the fact that it is a double - lined spectroscopic binary ( nissen 1989 ) of long but undetermined period .",
    "we set out to determine the nature of the two components and thus improve the reliability of the abundances in the system .",
    "cs  22876 - 032 has the added attraction that it is the main - sequence dwarf closest in abundance to the material which emerged from the big bang .",
    "it therefore has a potentially important role in constraining the primordial abundance of li , especially if the li abundance in higher metallicity stars has been elevated by galactic chemical evolution , as we contend elsewhere ( ryan et al .",
    "however , only after its atmospheric parameters have been reliably determined will one be in a position to fully realize that potential .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "the observational material upon which our analysis is based is presented in   2 , while in   3 we use the available material to present a first estimate of the period and orbital elements of the system .",

    "cs  22876032 was observed with the university college london coudchelle spectrograph , anglo - australian telescope combination during sessions in august 1996 , 1997 , and 1998 .",
    "the instrumental setup and data reduction techniques were as described by norris , ryan , & beers ( 1996 ) , and will not be discussed in detail here , except in particular instances where different techniques were dictated by the binarity of the system .",
    "suffice it to say that the material covers the wavelength range 37004700   and was obtained with resolving power 40000 .",
    "the numbers of detected photons in the spectra were 2700 , 5800 , and 3300 per 0.04  pixel at 4300  at the three epochs , respectively .",
    "a comparison of the spectra in the region of the ca ii k line , registered to the rest frame of the primary of the system , is presented in figure  1 .",
    "note the binary motion of the secondary as seen in the fe i lines and the asymmetry of the ca ii line . in an effort to best use the effective s / n @xmath1100 of the combined data set , equivalent widths were determined for each binary component in two ways .",
    "first , since the lines of the two stars are well separated in the 1996 and 1997 data , the spectra from these epochs were co - added in the rest frame of each component in turn , and equivalent widths measured using techniques similar to those described in norris et al .",
    "the second method utilized the relationship between central line depth and equivalent width .",
    "all three spectra were co - added in the rest frame of the relevant component , and central line depths measured .",
    "a quadratic was then fit to the dependence of these central depths on the equivalent widths which had been determined from the first method .",
    "this relationship was then used to determine equivalent widths for all lines having measured central depths .",
    "the final adopted equivalent widths , w@xmath16 and w@xmath17 , are the average of the two methods , and are presented in the final two columns of table  1 . throughout this work",
    "we shall denote the _ observed _ properties of primary and secondary with subscripts a and b , respectively , while for the inferred _ intrinsic _ parameters we shall use subscripts p and s. based on the number of photons detected , we expect the equivalent widths to be accurate to 12 m . the first three columns of the table present wavelength , excitation potential , and log  @xmath18 values from sources identified in norris et al .",

    "( 1993 ) is presented in figure  2 , where one sees that the presently derived equivalent widths are somewhat smaller than reported by them .",
    "we conjecture that this may have resulted from the continuum having been placed too high on the lower s / n spectra in these earlier investigations .    for lines stronger than 10 m in both members of the system ,",
    "figure  3 compares the ratio of primary to secondary equivalent widths as a function of primary line strength , wavelength , and excitation potential .",
    "one sees little , if any , dependence on wavelength and excitation , but an apparent correlation with line strength .",
    "note too the much smaller scatter in the w@xmath19/w@xmath17 vs w@xmath19 diagram , which is more commensurate with our error estimates , shown in the figure for @xmath11@xmath20 = 2 m .",
    "this may be understood in terms of curve - of - growth effects , to which we shall return in   4.1 .",
    "in   5.2 we shall introduce spectra taken at longer wavelengths to determine the strength of the li i 6707  line .",

    "the 21 radial velocity measurements are sufficient to constrain considerably the orbital elements of this system . in figure  4a we present the periodogram of the primary , determined using the procedure of lafler & kinman ( 1965 ) . our best estimate of the period from this method is @xmath1425 days .",
    "values corresponding to other less prominent dips in the figure result in the phased velocity diagram having considerably larger scatter than is seen for this value .    an initial estimate of the orbital elements for the two components",
    "was obtained by first setting the orbital period fixed at 425 days , and solving only for the elements of the primary using the method of russell - wilsing ( russell 1902 ; re - discussed by binnendijk 1960 ) .",
    "we then obtained estimates of the orbital elements for both the primary and secondary of cs  22876032 following the differential corrections procedure of lehmann - filhs ( 1894 ; re - discussed by underhill 1966 ) , using code kindly made available to us by dr .",
    "mathieu ( private communication ) .",
    "the code we employed , sbop , is an adaptation of a fortran ii code originally listed by wolfe , horak , & storer ( 1967 ) .",
    "solutions were attempted with an application of equal weights to all observations , followed by a de - weighting of the two observations made with the rgo spectrograph , in order to reflect their lower velocity accuracy .",
    "the elements which were obtained were quite similar in both cases .",
    "results are presented in columns ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) of table  3 .",
    "the observational data , phased to these elements , together with the model radial velocity curves for primary and secondary are presented in figure  4b .",
    "the agreement is quite satisfactory .    at the suggestion of the referee ,",
    "we have attempted to obtain orbital solutions with starting values for the period centered around the less prominent dips in the periodogram , at p @xmath1316 and p @xmath1500 days , respectively . in both instances ,",
    "sbop failed to converge to a satisfactory solution , consistent with our expectations . as a check on the sensitivity to the initial guess of the orbital period",
    ", we have also sought solutions with starting values for the period in the range 405 to 450 days . outside this range of initial periods ,",
    "sbop again failed to converge to a solution . for starting points within the above range",
    ", sbop converged to the same final period estimate , and the same set of orbital parameters as when we chose a starting period of 425 days .",
    "we conclude that our final solutions are stable , and accurate to the limit which the present data allow .",
    "future spectroscopic study of cs 22876032 will allow us to more fully populate the phase diagram , and hence enable refinement of the derived orbital elements .",
    "the errors on all of the estimated elements are also listed in table  3 . as can be seen from inspection of the table ,",
    "the elements are well constrained with the exception of the time of periastron passage ( t@xmath23 ) and the angle of periastron passage ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "this is perhaps to be expected given the low eccentricity of this system ( e @xmath1  0.12 ) and the relatively sparse phase coverage of our measurements . the mass ratio of the system m@xmath25/m@xmath26 = @xmath27 provides a useful confirmation of our attempt at deriving appropriate atmospheric parameters for the two components by comparison with model isochrones , discussed below .",
    "even though the error in t@xmath28 is larger than we would like , it corresponds to only 0.03 in phase , so one still obtains useful predictions of optimal observing opportunities when the components are expected to show the greatest velocity separation .    for heuristic purposes we present in column ( 4 ) of the table the changes to the elements which were obtained when",
    "the two most discrepant data points ( which have large observational uncertainties ) were removed from the data set . while this leads to elements with slightly improved errors , it is interesting to note that the differences are well within the cited errors in column ( 3 ) .",
    "we now consider whether cs  22876032 is an eclipsing system .",
    "given the large separation of this pair of dwarfs the likelihood is not great . assuming solar diameters",
    ", we estimate that the chance of eclipse is less than 0.02 , and its duration less than one day .",
    "we also note that while the period of the system is established to @xmath1  0.6 day , the zero point of the ephemeris is known to only 14 days , which will make the search for eclipse more difficult .",
    "that said , the additional insight to be obtained from eclipse information would seem to warrant such an effort .",
    "one may use the observed _ bvri _ and strmgren colors together with stellar evolutionary isochrones to constrain the atmospheric parameters of the components of the system .    with ( _ b ",
    "v_)@xmath23 = 0.395 , cs  22876032 could in principle comprise a system having either two objects below the halo main - sequence turnoff , or a system with one or both objects above it . the strmgren c@xmath22 value of 0.245 , however , which is typical of metal - poor main sequence dwarfs ( see schuster et al .",
    "1996 ) , clearly requires that both objects lie below the turnoff .",
    "if , for example , one forms composite colors from pairs of models on the vandenberg & bell ( 1985 ) isochrones with y = 0.20 , z = 0.0001 , and age = 14 gyr , one finds that with _ b ",
    "@xmath1  0.40 , c@xmath22 @xmath1  0.35 for those containing at least one star above the turnoff , and c@xmath22 @xmath1  0.25 for those with both below it . in what follows , therefore",
    ", we shall assume that both components of cs  22876032 lie below the main sequence turnoff .    for convenience",
    "we illustrate our method using the revised yale isochrones ( green , demarque , & king 1987 ( ryi ) ) , for y = 0.20 , z = 0.00001 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath1  2.3 ) , and age = 13 gyr , and later comment on its sensitivity to these choices .",
    "figure  5a , b show the locus of isochrone pairs of _ b  v _ and of t@xmath13 values which together combine to produce the value ( _ b  v_)@xmath23 = 0.395 observed for cs  22876032 .",
    "one sees that only a narrow range of permitted color and t@xmath13 exists for the primary , and one can thus constrain the parameters for this component quite well .",
    "the situation is not so favorable for the secondary , but once the primary is specified one can constrain the secondary by requiring that both stars have the same metallicity . an iterative procedure , which converged quickly , is described below .    for",
    "any isochrone pair one may also determine the equivalent width correction factors one should apply to observed line strengths to obtain intrinsic values .",
    "( the corrected equivalent widths are obtained by multiplying the observed ones by these factors . )",
    "the correction factors f@xmath29 and f@xmath30 are the reciprocals of the fractional flux contributions of the two components , so 1/f@xmath29 + 1/f@xmath30 = 1.0 , and the primary : secondary luminosity ratio is simply f@xmath30/f@xmath29 . the values are inferred directly from the isochrones .",
    "strictly , the ( f@xmath29 , f@xmath30 ) values are wavelength dependent , but in practice a single pair suffices throughout the blue - violet spectral region .",
    "we note for completeness that the values adopted here are determined at the effective wavelength of the b band .",
    "fluxes are sufficiently different in the red spectral region , however , that red - specific ratios must be utilized for the analysis of li  6707  (see below ) . in figure",
    "5c we show the locus of pairs of correction factors applicable in the blue - violet region .",
    "similar diagrams may be constructed for _ v  r _ and _ r  i_. given the observational data of table  1 , one is now in a position to determine abundances for model pairs which reproduce the observed colors .",
    "we refer the reader to ryan , norris , & beers ( 1996 ) for the details of our model atmosphere abundance determination technique , which are quite standard and which we shall not repeat here , except to note that we employ bell ( 1983 ) models in our analysis .",
    "figure  6 shows the dependence of [ fe / h ] on t@xmath31 for several pairs of permitted primary , secondary pairs , determined when using atmospheric parameters based on _ b ",
    "v_. by adopting the requirement that both components have the same value of [ fe / h ] ( to within 0.01 dex ) we then remove the degeneracy of the procedure .",
    "similar diagrams were constructed using _ v  r _ and _ r  i _ rather than _",
    "b  v _ to constrain the atmospheric parameters .",
    "table  4 contains the results , where column ( 1 ) presents the observed composite color , columns ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) , and ( 5 ) contain the mass , t@xmath13 , color , and equivalent width correction factor for the primary , respectively , and columns ( 6)(9 ) give the same parameters for the secondary . assigning equal weight to the values for each of the three cases we find that the system has [ fe / h ] = 3.71 and that the masses are 0.83 and 0.73 m@xmath2 .",
    "the average mass ratio is 0.88 , in pleasing accord with the analysis of orbital parameters in ",
    "3 . finally ,",
    "in table  5 we present our adopted atmospheric parameters for the components of the system .",
    "in figure  3 we showed that the ratio of observed equivalent widths , w@xmath16/w@xmath17 , increases with line strength .",
    "the equivalent width correction factors derived in the decomposition of the binary , f@xmath32 and f@xmath33 , are listed in table  4 and aid in explaining the observed variation of the ratio of the observed equivalent widths .",
    "specifically , the large value of f@xmath33 indicates that the _ apparently _ weak lines in the secondary ( w@xmath17 in the range 824  m ) are in reality stronger by a factor @xmath1  4.6 in the uncontaminated spectrum , and thus occupy the moderately strong range 37  @xmath34  w@xmath35  @xmath34  110  m , partially on the flat part of the curve of growth .",
    "the primary , on the other hand , has only a factor 1.28 difference between its observed ( w@xmath19 ) and intrinsic ( w@xmath26 ) values , confirming that most of its lines do indeed lie on the linear portion of the curve of growth .",
    "the increase in the ratio w@xmath19/w@xmath17 is therefore understood as the progressive saturation of the secondary s lines with increasing line strength , while those of the primary are not so affected .",
    "we illustrate this in figure  7 , which compares the observations with theoretical line ratios computed for two stars having the adopted parameter set .",
    "the theoretical curve reproduces the observed behavior quite well , confirming the origin of this effect .",
    "the reader might comment that the agreement is less than satisfactory for @xmath36 @xmath37 40 m , and we would have to concur .",
    "we note , however , that it is in this regime that the lines of the secondary have @xmath38 @xmath1  100140 m and experience strong saturation effects .",
    "it is not unlikely that uncertainties in the relatively poorly - defined adopted microturbulence of the secondary and the treatment of van der waals broadening ( see e.g. ryan 1998 ) might lead to significant error in the theoretical strengths of these lines .",
    "how robust are the abundances and atmospheric parameters in tables  4 and 5 ?",
    "the answer is somewhat complicated because of the interplay of the two components of the binary .",
    "we discuss random and systematic errors , including the impact of one star upon the other , and summarize the situation in table  6 .",
    "first consider the uncertainties in the adopted atmospheric parameters .",
    "errors in color - effective temperature transformations of @xmath1  100  k are ( unfortunately ) common in the analyses of metal - poor stars .",
    "if the two components of the system were of comparable spectral type , both would be affected similarly by this error source . since ,",
    "however , their temperatures differ by 700  k , independent errors of 100  k are allocated to each .",
    "additionally , errors in photometry and reddening are 0.01  mag , each yielding an additional uncertainty of 4060  k. the adopted error in each star s t@xmath13 , summing in quadrature , is therefore 130  k. we note that this is consistent with the range of temperatures derived in table  4 for the three photometric colors .",
    "the error in t@xmath13 for the secondary , however , has almost no impact on the derived [ fe / h ] of the system , as can be seen in figure  6 , since an incorrect temperature will be compensated for by a change in the derived f@xmath35 factor . we assign 0.10  dex and 0.03  dex as the error in [ fe / h ] induced by the primary and secondary stars temperature uncertainties , respectively .",
    "we adopt the sensitivity to errors in microturbulence and surface gravity from the calculations , but apply only those due to the primary , again because of the weak sensitivity to the secondary s parameters .    taking all atmospheric parameter uncertainties into account",
    "the quadratic sum of errors in [ fe / h ] is 0.11  dex .",
    "errors in the parameters of the primary and secondary also change the inferred mass ratio of the system .",
    "there is little latitude for the mass of the primary , as indicated by the small range of t@xmath13 and f@xmath26 values in figure  6 .",
    "however , the temperature and mass inferred for the secondary will vary if the primary is revised .",
    "changes in the primary corresponding to @xmath39[fe / h ]  =  0.11  dex ( from above ) would induce a change in the secondary corresponding to 0.02 in the mass ratio .",
    "the small sensitivity of the mass ratio to the decomposition of the system is confirmed in table  4 , where the range of values is 0.015 .",
    "additional errors are associated with the adoption of a particular model atmosphere grid , which can lead to differences of 0.10  dex ( ryan et al .",
    "1996 ,   3.2 ) , and in the isochrones used in the decomposition of the binary .",
    "the latter effect was assessed by changing the adopted ryi isochrone and viewing the impact on the derived parameters of the binary .",
    "reasonable changes in helium , heavy element abundance , and age , of @xmath39y  =  0.05 , @xmath39log  z  =  0.5 , and @xmath39age  =  2 gyr , respectively , lead to changes in the abundance of the primary @xmath39[fe / h ]  @xmath8  0.04 .",
    "the corresponding change in the mass ratio is also small , @xmath40  0.02 .",
    "we also repeated the temperature and abundance determination exercise at z = 0.0001 for the isochrones of the ryi , of bergbusch & vandenberg ( 1992 ) and those of the padua group available in 1999",
    "october at http://dns2.pd.astro.it/. using _ b  v _ to constrain the temperature we obtained [ fe / h]@xmath26 = 3.52 .",
    "3.51 , and 3.38 , respectively .",
    "the difference between the value obtained by adoption of the padua and the others is driven essentially by a difference in their adopted _ b  v _ , t@xmath31 transformation , the role of which has already been considered above .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that our abundance determination for cs  22876032 is insensitive to the adoption of the revised yale isochrones .",
    "the summary of the error budget is shown in table  6 , where column ( 1 ) lists the error source , column ( 2 ) the representative error in the parameter , and column ( 3 ) the error in the abundance of the primary ( and hence of the system ) or m@xmath35/m@xmath26 , as appropriate .",
    "given these errors we conclude that the abundance of cs  22876032 is 3.71 @xmath0 0.11 @xmath0 0.12 , where the first and second uncertainties refer to random and systematic errors , respectively .",
    "it is of interest to compare this value with the significantly lower abundances reported by molaro & castelli ( 1990 ) and norris et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , who found [ fe / h ] = 4.29 and 4.31 , respectively . for illustrative purposes we show in table  7 abundance changes which result from various sources between the present value and that of norris et al .",
    "( 1993 ) . in all but two cases the parameters and assumptions made in the present work lead to a higher abundance , accumulating to @xmath1  + 0.4 when taken one at a time",
    " not too much below the reported difference of + 0.6 .",
    "although cs  22876 - 032 is still the most metal - poor dwarf known , our current best estimate of its metallicity is considerably less extreme than the first measurements .",
    "we complete the discussion by noting that in our high - resolution studies and those of mcwilliam et al .",
    "( 1995 ) no halo dwarf _ or _ giant is known with [ fe / h ]  @xmath41 .",
    "the low - resolution surveys of beers and his co - workers also strongly suggest that the metallicity distribution of the galactic halo cuts off near this value ( e.g. beers et al .",
    "1998 ; norris 1999 ) .      using the techniques described in some detail in ryan et al .",
    "( 1996 ) we next computed the abundances of the other elements .",
    "results for the two components are presented in table  8 , where the column headers should be self - evident except perhaps for column ( 2 ) , which gives details of the features used in the abundance determination . at the metal weakness of cs  22876032 ,",
    "one has in most cases only one or two lines from which to determine the abundance .",
    "if only one feature is available we give its wavelength in column ( 2 ) ; otherwise the number of lines involved is tabulated .",
    "the standard errors given in columns ( 5 ) and ( 7 ) were determined using techniques described by ryan et al .",

    "the reader should note that our knowledge of the abundances of elements , other than fe , observed in cs  22876032 is based on only eight atomic lines .",
    "table  8 also contains abundance limits for a number of elements which are more stringent than previously available , given the higher s / n of the present investigation .",
    "we note that in most cases limits are given only for the primary of the system , since they are not very useful for the secondary .",
    "the present data permit us to revisit the mn abundance of cs  22876 - 032 .",

    "the abundances determined for the two components of cs  22876032 are in excellent agreement , consistent with the atmospheric parameters of both objects having been well determined .",
    "the exception is si for which the relative abundances disagree by 0.50 , a difference formally significant at the 1.9@xmath11 level . in comparison ,",
    "the mean absolute difference for the four other elements observed in both components is 0.05 dex .",
    "although a 1.9@xmath11 difference is not highly significant , we have scrutinized all of our spectra of this line .",
    "we find no reason beyond the formal errors for mistrusting this measurement .",
    "however , we remain also at a loss to explain the different si abundances in the two components .",
    "evidence has mounted over the past decade that below [ fe / h ]  =  @xmath44 , galactic chemical enrichment was a rather patchy business ( e.g. ryan , norris & bessell 1991 ; mcwilliam et al .",
    "1995 ; ryan et al .",
    "1996 ) , leading to models in which such metal - poor objects are formed in the interaction of supernova remnants with material in their immediate vicinity ( ryan et al . 1996",
    "; tsujimoto et al . 1999 ) .",
    "in such models , one expects the abundance patterns of the most metal - poor stars to be representative of individual supernova , rather than of a time - averaged ensemble .",
    "hence , high - resolution spectroscopic analyses of extremely metal - poor stars provide a powerful probe of the nature of the first supernovae in the milky way .",
    "given the paucity of lines in cs  22876032 we have only al and the @xmath10elements to discuss .",
    "in the context of star - to - star scatter we shall defer further consideration until we present results on the other four extremely metal - poor stars for which we have data , and which we mentioned in   1  except to note here that the value [ al / fe ] = 0.44 for cs  22876032 lies within @xmath1  0.20 of the mean line determined for the sample of metal - poor stars discussed in the investigation of ryan et al .",
    "( 1996 , figure  3 ) .    in the spirit of associating the yields of particular supernovae models with the observed abundances in extremely metal - poor stars ,",
    "we conclude by discussing the @xmath10elements . for mg , which is produced mainly during hydrostatic carbon and neon burning we find [ mg / fe ] = 0.50 . for si and ca we find a weighted mean value , which we designate [ @xmath45si , ca@xmath46/fe ] , of 0.05 ( the data were weighted by the inverse square of their errors ) .",
    "these elements are produced by a combination of hydrostatic oxygen shell burning and explosive oxygen burning , which varies from star to star ( weaver & woosley 1993 ) .",
    "as discussed by woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) , the predicted yields of si and ca are expected to vary relative to mg , depending sensitively on several physical effects .",
    "( these include among others the treatment of convection , the density structure near the iron core , the location of the mass cut , and the amount of material which falls back in the explosion . ) for cs  22876032 we have [ @xmath45si , ca@xmath46/mg ] = 0.55 .",
    "it is then interesting to consider the production factors of the zero - heavy - element model supernovae of woosley & weaver ( 1995 , table 17 ) . for those models which produce significant amounts of mg , si , and ca we find the results presented in figure  8 . if one were to seek to interpret the data for cs  22876032 in terms of enrichment from a single zero - heavy - element supernova one could identify it , quite reasonably , with the woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) 30 m@xmath2 model z30b .",
    "titanium is produced under more extreme conditions than si and ca , as discussed by woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) . in cs  22876032 , as for si and ca , [ ti / fe ] is low relative to [ mg / fe ] : we find [ ti / mg ] = 0.39 .",
    "this is also best reproduced by woosley & weaver model z30b .",
    "is our result of [ al / mg ] = 0.94 @xmath0 0.17 consistent with the hypothesis ? before comparison with theory",
    "one must correct the present lte abundance for al for non - lte effects . according to baumller & gehren ( 1997 ) , lte abundances for al based on the line we have used underestimate the abundance by @xmath1  0.65 dex at [ fe / h ]",

    "for the above - mentioned models of woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) , in comparison , one finds [ al / mg ] in the range @xmath1  0.65@xmath470.35 .",
    "that is , the models do not strongly constrain the situation , and within the observational errors one has reasonable agreement between theory and observation .",
