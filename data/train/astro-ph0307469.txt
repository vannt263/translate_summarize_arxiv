    "the wmap mission was designed to make the full sky cmb maps with high accuracy , precision , and reliability .",
    "the sky map data products derived from the wmap observations have 45 times the sensitivity and 33 times the angular resolution of the cobe / dmr mission ( bennett et al .",
    "there are four w band ( @xmath17 ghz ) , two v band ( @xmath18 ghz ) , two q band ( @xmath19 ghz ) , one ka band ( @xmath20 ghz ) , and one k band ( @xmath21 ghz ) differencing assemblies , with @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 fwhm beam widths , respectively .",

    "the galactic dust , free - free , and synchrotron emissions are highly non - gaussian sources , and their contribution to the measured genus is not negligible even at high galactic latitude ( ppr ) .",
    "therefore , we use the 100 @xmath29 dust ( schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis 1998 ; finkbeiner , davis , & schlegel 1999 ) , h@xmath30 ( finkbeiner 2003 ) , and synchrotron ( haslam et al . 1981 , 1982 ) emission maps multiplied with coefficients given in table 3 of bennett et al .",

    "we mask 23.2% of the sky that has significant foreground contamination from our galaxy and point sources using the conservative kp0 mask ( bennett et al .",
    "we also remove additional 0.3% of the sky corresponding to the small islands outside the north and south caps .",
    "the remaining survey area in the genus measurement is 76.5% of the sky .",

    "compared to the contour2d algorithm ( melott et al .",
    "1989 ) that was used in colley & gott ( 2003 ) , this direct contour - integration method has an advantage that it can accurately calculate the genus when the survey region is enclosed by complicated boundaries ( see fig .",

    "1994 ) . for each map",
    "we calculate area fraction threshold levels on a sphere with healpix format and with the same resolution as the stereographically projected map .",

    "non - gaussian feature in the cmb anisotropy will appear as deviations of the genus curve from this relation .",

    "tegmark et al . ( 2003 ) also show that the foregrounds in their tcm are subdominant in all but the very innermost galactic plane , for @xmath200 .",
    "furthermore , galaxy foregrounds induce non - gaussian feature by making the genus shifted to the left at all threshold levels . as for the positive @xmath2 on the southern hemisphere in the high resolution w band data , it is more reliable that such non - gaussianity is caused by point sources that have not been removed by the kp0 mask because positive @xmath2 means that more hot spots are present than cold spots",
    ". furthermore , another non - gaussian signature , the large genus amplitude difference between the north and the south , does not show frequency dependence since all wmap band maps ( q , v , and w ) , ilc and tcm show the similar non - gaussian feature .",
    "it should be noted that the three independent methods of foreground - subtraction were applied to make the wmap band maps , ilc , and tcm .",
    "however , we can not conclude that the non - gaussian signatures are free from the effect of foreground contamination .",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath201 decrease as the higher galactic cut is applied , though their dependence on the galactic cut is weak .",
    "second , the non - gaussianity can appear due to the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) and the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effects .",
    "the large - scale structures , which intersect the paths of cmb photons , can affect the primary cmb anisotropy . in a @xmath8-dominated cdm universe ,",
    "the cmb anisotropies are expected to be correlated with matter density fluctuations at @xmath202 through the isw effect ( crittenden & turok 1996 ) .",
    "nolta et al . (",

    "reionisation damping depends on the total optical depth @xmath205 and the angular scale subtended by the horizon at the last scattering surface defined during the reionisation epoch .",
    "the primary cmb anisotropy @xmath206 is damped to @xmath207 by the thompson scattering with electrons , and the damping contribution to the anisotropy depends on scales .",
    "the characteristic damping scale @xmath208 is given by @xmath209 ( hu & white 1997 ; griffiths , barbosa , & liddle 1999 ) , where @xmath210 denotes the reionisation epoch . for @xmath211 and @xmath212 ,",
    "the characteristic damping scale is @xmath213 .",
    "therefore the damping is also important at low @xmath7-modes . for homogeneous reionisation ,",
    "the reionisation process damps the cmb anisotropy linearly and keeps the gaussianity of the primordial fluctuations .",
    "however , if the reionisation is inhomogeneous , for example , due to the inhomogeneous ionisation fraction or the patchy reionisation , the cmb anisotropy of low @xmath7-modes can be partially contaminated by the inhomogeneous thompson scattering , and becomes non - gaussian . these low @xmath7-modes ( quadrupole and octopole )",
    "happen to be aligned along the galactic plane , make the biggest spots near the galactic plane ( tegmark et al .",
    "2003 ; de oliveira - costa et al .",
    "2003 ) , and may change the temperature distributions of the galactic north and south hemispheres differently .",
    "finally , the non - gaussian signatures that have been detected may have the primordial origin .",
    "while the simple inflation predicts that the primordial fluctuation field is gaussian , the non - linear couplings between the inflaton and the fluctuation fields or between the quantum and the classical fluctuation fields can produce weakly non - gaussian fluctuations ( komatsu & spergel 2001 , references therein ) .",
    "multi - field inflationary models predict that the primordial metric fluctuations do not need to obey gaussian statistics ( e.g. , bernardeau & uzan 2002 ) .",
    "there are also many mechanisms that can generate non - gaussian density perturbations during the inflation ( e.g. , bartolo , matarrese , & riotto 2002 ; dvali , gruzinov , & zaldarriaga 2003 ) .",
    "we have investigated the topology of cmb anisotropy from the wmap 1-year maps by measuring the genus and its related statistics .",
    "the measured wmap genus curves clearly deviate from the gaussian prediction in two distinctive manners .",
    "first , the genus asymmetry parameter @xmath2 is positive on the galactic southern hemisphere in the wmap w band map ( @xmath3 scale ) , a non - gaussian feature that is significant at @xmath5 level , while @xmath2 on the galactic northern hemisphere is consistent with zero .",
    "second , the genus amplitude difference between the north and the south hemispheres ( @xmath187 ) deviates from gaussian prediction at @xmath191 ",
    "@xmath4 levels at wmap q , v , and w bands . compared to the 500 gaussian mock observations ,",
    "the observed genus amplitude differences indicate that the gaussianity of cmb anisotropy field is ruled out at about 99% ( 95% ) confidence level when the kp0 mask ( kp0 mask and @xmath192 galactic cut ) is applied .",
    "these non - gaussian features have weak dependence on the galactic cut .",
    "similar results based on the power spectrum analysis have also been reported by eriksen et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .    to investigate the nature of the non - gaussian features that have been detected , we need cmb data with higher signal - to - noise ratio as well as the accurate models for the galactic foregrounds .",
    "we wish that the next release of wmap data or those of the future cmb experiments would enable us to resolve these problems . as for the possibility of reionisation - induced non - gaussianity at large scales",
    ", we also need to study the topology of the cmb polarisation map ( e.g. , park & park 2002 ) .",
