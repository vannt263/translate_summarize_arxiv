    "the complexified heat traces of @xmath0 and @xmath81 associated with the laplacian on @xmath2-forms coincide except for a factor of @xmath61 .",

    ", it was already known that the contribution of @xmath102 to the complexified heat trace on @xmath104-forms must be zero up to principal order since the principal order coefficient is the trace of the holonomy map about the geodesic .",
    "most , though not all , of the examples we construct below will be surfaces .",
    "however , by taking products of the manifolds in these examples with a closed manifold @xmath81 and applying the second statement of corollary 1.4 , one obtains examples in arbitrary even dimensions .",

    "* products of spheres and projective spaces with different length spectra and injectivity radius * let @xmath108 and @xmath109 denote the sphere and projective space , respectively , of radius @xmath11 and dimension @xmath37 . then by corollary 1.5 , for @xmath110 and for any @xmath111 , the manifolds @xmath112 and @xmath113 have the same @xmath114-spectrum .",
    "however , for generic choices of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the lengths of the shortest closed geodesics in the two manifolds differ .",
    "these closed manifolds are also isospectral to the product of a hemisphere and a sphere , as can be seen by taking an involution of @xmath115 given by the equatorial reflection in one factor    we next consider flat manifolds .",

    "indeed each of these is a quotient of @xmath117 by an involution @xmath20 arising from an involution @xmath118 of @xmath119 given as follows : for the klein bottle , @xmath118 is the composition of translation by @xmath120 with reflection @xmath121 about the @xmath50-axis . for the cylinder , @xmath118 is the reflection @xmath121 just defined .",

    "\\(c ) the laplacians acting on functions on these surfaces are not isospectral .",
    "these surfaces are also 1-isospectral to each of four hyperbolic surfaces with boundary having 2 , 4 , @xmath138 , and @xmath139 boundary components , respectively .",
    "we remark that ( b ) implies ( c ) , since the 0-spectrum determines the weak length spectrum ( i.e. , the spectrum of lengths of closed geodesics , ignoring multiplicities ) in the case of hyperbolic manifolds .",
    "( aside : for riemann surfaces , it is a classical result of huber that the 0-spectrum and the strong length spectrum , i.e. , the spectrum of lengths , counting multiplicities , determine each other .",
    "this result has been extended to non - orientable hyperbolic surfaces by peter doyle and the second author in an article in preparation . )",
    "we construct an orientable surface @xmath140 as follows : let @xmath141 be a pair of hyperbolic pants , as shown in figure 1 ; the boundary geodesics of the pant legs have the same length , while the waist may have a different length .",
    "the pants are formed by gluing together two identical right - angled geodesic hexagons along three sides .",
    "the hexagon is also pictured in figure 1 .",
    "choose a positive integer @xmath10 and glue together @xmath142 isometric copies @xmath143 of @xmath141 to obtain a riemann surface @xmath140 of genus @xmath144 . to describe the symmetries , we will visualize @xmath140 ( as shown in figure 2 in case @xmath145 ) as obtained from a surface @xmath81 with boundary in @xmath146 with appropriate identifications of boundary edges .",
    "the three symmetries @xmath147 , @xmath148 , and @xmath149 of @xmath81 given by reflection across the @xmath150-plane , the @xmath151-plane and the @xmath152-plane , respectively , define commuting involutive isometries of @xmath140 .",
    "( we are using the indices @xmath153 , @xmath154 , and @xmath155 here to indicate reflection across planes that are horizontal , vertical , or the plane of the paper . )",
    "there are additional isometric involutions of @xmath140 ( not of @xmath81 ) given by reflections across vertical planes passing through the waists of two of the pants .",
    "choose such a symmetry and denote it by @xmath156 .",
    "e.g. , in case @xmath145 , a choice of @xmath156 interchanges pants @xmath157 with @xmath158 and @xmath159 with @xmath160 in figure 2 .",
    "finally , let @xmath161 be the orientation preserving isometric involution ( rotation ) @xmath161 sending the pair of pants @xmath162 to the pants @xmath163 mod @xmath142 , for each @xmath164 .",
    "note that @xmath165 and @xmath166 commute with @xmath161 .",
    "thus the isometries @xmath167 , @xmath168 , @xmath169 , and @xmath170 are involutive , orientation - reversing , fixed - point - free isometries of @xmath140 .",
    "we set @xmath171 , for @xmath172 . the surfaces @xmath173 are depicted in figure 3 in case @xmath145 .",
    "these non - orientable surfaces have genus @xmath174 , and , topologically , they are spheres with @xmath175 handles and two cross handles , or equivalently , spheres with @xmath176 cross handles .    for generic choices of the hyperbolic pants",
    "@xmath141 used to build the surfaces above , the four surfaces will have different geodesic length spectra .",
    "for concreteness , we will make a specific choice of @xmath141 to guarantee that one of the surfaces has a strictly smaller injectivity radius than the others .",
    "there exists a unique right - angled hexagon as in figure 1 for each given choice of @xmath177 and @xmath102 .",
    "( see buser @xcite , theorem 2.4.2 . )",
    "we choose @xmath177 and @xmath102 to be less than @xmath178 and to satisfy @xmath179 .",
    "since the waist of the resulting pants has length @xmath180 and the boundary geodesics of the legs have length @xmath181 , the resulting surface @xmath140 has @xmath182 closed geodesics of length @xmath180 and @xmath142 of length @xmath181 . by theorem 4.1.6 of @xcite , a surface of genus @xmath137 can have at most @xmath183 simple closed geodesics of length less than or equal to @xmath184 .",
    "thus the geodesics in @xmath140 corresponding to the boundary geodesics of the pants are the only simple closed geodesics satisfying this bound on their lengths .",
    "now for @xmath185 , consider the shortest `` new '' closed geodesic in the surface @xmath173 , i.e. , the shortest closed geodesic that does not lift to a closed geodesic of the same length in @xmath140 .",
    "these geodescis are depicted in figure 3 in case @xmath145 .",
    "( the relative lengths of the geodesics in the figures are distorted . )",
    "the surface @xmath136 contains a geodesic of length @xmath102 .",
    "this geodesic is shorter than any closed geodesic in the orther surfaces .",
    "thus @xmath136 has smaller injectivity radius than the others .",
    "thus statement ( b ) of the theorem is satisfied .    for the final statement of the theorem ,",
    "we use corollary 1.4 to observe that the surfaces @xmath173 are also 1-isospectral to the four surfaces @xmath186 , @xmath187 , @xmath188 , and @xmath189 with boundary .",
    "these surfaces have @xmath139 , @xmath138 , 4 and 2 boundary components , respectively .    letting @xmath140 be the surface of genus",
    "@xmath190 , @xmath191 , pictured in figure 4 , one may take the quotient of @xmath140 by each of the three visual symmetries ( reflection across a vertical plane , horizontal plane , and plane of the paper ) to obtain 1-isospectral surfaces with boundary .",
    "the first has only one boundary component , while the others have @xmath192 .",
    "* surfaces with boundaries of arbitrarily different shapes .",
    "* this final example involves manifolds of mixed curvature .",
    "let @xmath0 be a 2-sphere with a non - standard metric , symmetric with respect to reflection across two orthogonal planes .",
    "the quotients of @xmath0 by these isometric involutions are 1-isospectral manifolds with boundaries . by choosing the metrics on @xmath0 appropriately",
    ", one can more or less arbitrarily prescribe independently the geodesic curvatures of the boundary curves .",
    "does the spectrum distinguish orbifolds with singularities from smooth manifolds ?",
    "we will see below that the middle degree hodge spectrum can not detect the presence of singularities .",
    "we do not know whether the 0-spectrum always detects singularities .",
    "however , we will show in propositions 3.4 and 3.5 that it does in many situations , including all the examples we will give of orbifolds and manifolds which are isospectral in the middle degree .",
    "the four pillow is the quotient of @xmath117 by the involution @xmath161 induced from the map @xmath194 .",
    "it is a pillow - shaped orbifold with isolated singularities at the four corners . since @xmath161 is not orientation reversing",
    ", we can not apply corollary 1.4 .",
    "instead we will compare the spectra directly .",
    "every 1-form on @xmath195 may be written in the form @xmath196 , where @xmath197 and @xmath198 are the forms induced on @xmath195 by the standard forms on @xmath119 . since @xmath199 @xmath200 consists of two copies of @xmath201 .",
    "hence each of the manifolds in example 2.5 has 1-spectrum equal to the 0-spectrum of @xmath195 .    since",
    "both @xmath197 and @xmath198 are @xmath161-anti - invariant , the space of @xmath161-invariant one - forms on @xmath195 is given by @xmath202 thus @xmath203 is formed by two copies of the spectrum of the laplacian of @xmath195 acting on the space of @xmath161-anti - invariant smooth functions . by fourier decomposition on the torus , one sees that the laplacian of @xmath195 restricted to the @xmath161-anti - invariant smooth functions has the same spectrum as the laplacian restricted to the @xmath161-invariant smooth functions .",
    "consequently @xmath204 and the theorem follows .",

    "this orbifold has only isolated singularities ; i.e. , the dimension of its singular set is zero .",

    "let @xmath215 be the quotient of @xmath195 by @xmath211 . by corollary 1.4 , these orbifolds are mutually @xmath2-isospectral .",
    "since the direct product of a cubical @xmath207-torus with any of the manifolds or orbifolds in theorem 3.1 may also be viewed as a quotient of @xmath195 by an involution , the final statement of the theorem follows .",

    "their method extends to flat orbifolds and can be used to give an alternative proof of theorem 3.2(i ) as well as of the earlier examples of flat manifolds and/or orbifolds .",
    "we next show that the orbifolds and manifolds in theorems 3.1 and 3.2 are not 0-isospectral .",

    "<S> to what extent does spectral data associated with the hodge laplacian @xmath3 on a compact riemannian manifold @xmath0 determine the geometry and topology of @xmath0 ? let @xmath4 denote the spectrum of the hodge laplacian acting on the space of @xmath5-forms on @xmath0 , with absolute boundary conditions in case the boundary of @xmath0 is non - empty . </S>",
    "<S> ( we will review the notion of absolute and relative boundary conditions in section 1 . ) for each @xmath5 , the spectrum @xmath4 is known to contain considerable geometric information . for example , under genericity conditions , the @xmath5-spectrum of a closed riemannian manifold @xmath0 determines the geodesic length spectrum of @xmath0 .    in this article , we will focus on even - dimensional manifolds and give a very simple method for obtaining manifolds with the same hodge spectrum in the middle degree . through examples </S>",
    "<S> , we will discover that this middle degree spectrum contains a perhaps surprising lack of topological and geometric information .    </S>",
    "<S> among the examples of manifolds that we will construct with the same middle degree spectrum are :    * a cylinder , a mbius strip , and a klein bottle ; * pairs of cylinders with different boundary lengths ; * a hemisphere and a projective space ; * products @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , respectively @xmath9 , denote a projective space , respectively sphere , of radius @xmath10 ( for generic @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the length spectra differ ) ; * non - orientable closed hyperbolic surfaces with different injectivity radius and length spectrum ; * pairs of surfaces , one with an arbitrarily large number of boundary components and the other closed . the metrics can be chosen to be hyperbolic .    </S>",
    "<S> we also obtain examples in all even dimensions exhibiting similar properties .    </S>",
    "<S> these examples prove :    the middle degree hodge spectrum of an even - dimensional riemannian manifold @xmath0 does _ not _ determine :    * the volume of the boundary or even whether @xmath0 has boundary ; * the geodesic length spectrum or injectivity radius . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it does not determine the length of the shortest closed geodesic .    </S>",
    "<S> the result ( i ) is new . concerning ( ii ) , r. miatello and the second author @xcite recently constructed examples of flat manifolds , @xmath5-isospectral for various choices of @xmath5 , such that the length of the shortest closed geodesic differed . </S>",
    "<S> ( here , we say two manifolds are @xmath5-isospectral if they have the same @xmath5-spectrum . )    </S>",
    "<S> note that all the closed manifolds that we construct are non - orientable . for _ </S>",
    "<S> orientable _ surfaces , the 1-spectrum completely determines the 0-spectrum ( which coincides with the 2-spectrum ) . thus the behavior exhibited by our examples can not occur for 1-isospectral orientable surfaces . for _ non - orientable _ surfaces , the 0-spectrum and 2-spectrum no longer coincide and the 1-spectrum is the join of the two ( except for the 0-eigenspace ) . </S>",
    "<S> our examples show that the join of the two spectra contains less geometric information than either one individually . in higher dimensions , </S>",
    "<S> it is perhaps surprising that all our examples are non - orientable . </S>",
    "<S> the hodge @xmath13 operator intertwines the exact and co - exact middle degree forms and commutes with the laplacian ; thus the `` exact '' and `` co - exact spectra '' coincide . </S>",
    "<S> hence the @xmath2-spectrum of a @xmath1-dimensional _ orientable _ closed manifold , @xmath14 , contains half the information contained in the @xmath15-spectrum and nothing more ( except for the dimension of the space of harmonic forms ) . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for non - orientable manifolds , the `` exact '' and `` co - exact spectra '' no longer coincide , so the middle degree spectrum obstensibly contains the same amount of data as the other spectra .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the primary tools for recovering geometric and topological information from the spectra is through the small time asymptotics of the heat equation . </S>",
    "<S> see , for example , @xcite or @xcite , @xcite . for closed manifolds </S>",
    "<S> , the trace of the heat kernel associated with the hodge laplacian on @xmath5-forms has an asymptotic expansion of the form @xmath16 the coefficients @xmath17 are spectral invariants and are given by integrals , with respect to the riemannian measure , of expressions involving the curvature and its covariant derivatives . </S>",
    "<S> the first three heat invariants are given as follows : @xmath18 ; @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the scalar curvature and @xmath21 , @xmath22 , is a constant depending only on @xmath5 ; and @xmath23 is a linear combination , with coefficients depending only on @xmath5 , of @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    </S>",
    "<S> for manifolds with boundary , the expansion is instead in powers of @xmath27 . the coefficient @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 , where @xmath30 .    </S>",
    "<S> a very difficult open question is whether the heat invariants are the only integral invariants of the spectrum , i.e. , the only invariants which are integrals of curvature expressions either over the manifold or over the boundary . </S>",
    "<S> this article and work of dorothee schueth lend support ( albeit in a small way ) towards an affirmative answer since :    * the coefficient @xmath31 vanishes precisely when @xmath32 is even and @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> our examples show in this case that the @xmath5-spectrum indeed does not determine the volume of the boundary . </S>",
    "<S> * dorothee schueth @xcite showed that the three individual integral terms in the expression for @xmath34 are not spectral invariants .    </S>",
    "<S> a secondary theme of this paper is the spectrum of riemannian orbifolds . </S>",
    "<S> riemannian orbifolds are analogs of riemannian manifolds but with singularities . </S>",
    "<S> they are locally modelled on quotients of riemannian manifolds by finite effective isometric group actions . </S>",
    "<S> the singularities in the orbifold correspond to the singular orbits . </S>",
    "<S> one can define the notion of laplacian on @xmath5-forms on orbifolds . </S>",
    "<S> a natural question is whether the spectrum contains information about the singularities . </S>",
    "<S> we will see :    the middle degree hodge spectrum can not distinguish riemannian manifolds from riemannian orbifolds with singularities .    </S>",
    "<S> for example , we will see that the mutually 1-isospectral cylinder , klein bottle and mbius strip are also 1-isospectral to a `` pillow '' , a 2-dimensional orbifold with four singular points , so named because of its shape . in dimension @xmath1 , @xmath14 , we will also construct orbifolds that are @xmath2-isospectral to a projective space and to a hemisphere . to our knowledge , </S>",
    "<S> the examples given here are the first examples of orbifolds @xmath5-isospectral to manifolds for some @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we do not know whether the spectrum of the laplacian on functions can distinguish orbifolds from manifolds , although we will give some positive results in @xmath35 and we will verify that none of the middle degree isospectral orbifolds and manifolds we construct are 0-isospectral .    </S>",
    "<S> we will also construct orbifolds , isospectral in the middle degree , having singular sets of arbitrarily different dimensions .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we have concentrated on @xmath2-isospectrality of @xmath1-manifolds and orbifolds . however , for various choices of @xmath5 , one can also obtain @xmath5-isospectral orbifolds with singular sets of different dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon may be discussed in a later paper .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude these introductory remarks with a partial history of the isospectral problem for the hodge laplacian . for a general survey of isospectral manifolds , </S>",
    "<S> see @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most known examples of isospectral manifolds , e.g. , those constructed by the method of sunada @xcite , are strongly isospectral ; in particular , the manifolds are @xmath5-isospectral for all @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> thus they do not reveal possible differences in the geometric information contained in the various @xmath5-spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the article @xcite gave the first example of @xmath36-isospectral manifolds which are not 1-isospectral ; further examples were given in @xcite,@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( the @xmath36-spectrum , i.e. , the spectrum of the laplacian acting on smooth functions , is frequently referred to simply as the spectrum of the manifold . ) ikeda @xcite constructed , for each positive integer @xmath37 , spherical space forms which are @xmath5-isospectral for all @xmath5 less than @xmath37 but not for @xmath38 . in the past decade , many examples have been constructed of @xmath36-isospectral manifolds with different local as well as global geometry , e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , and @xcite ; at least in those cases in which comparisons of the higher @xmath5-spectra have been carried out , these manifolds are not @xmath5-isospectral for @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> the first examples of manifolds which are @xmath5-isospectral for some values of @xmath5 but not for @xmath40 were flat manifolds constructed by r. miatello and the second author in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> r. gornet and j. mcgowan ( private communication ) recently constructed examples of spherical space forms which are simultaneously @xmath5-isospectral for @xmath40 and for various other , but not all , @xmath5 .    </S>",
