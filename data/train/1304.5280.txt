    "recently , @xcite reported the discovery of g2 , an extremely red object with spatially resolved br-@xmath1  emission .",
    "the object was interpreted as a @xmath9 earth mass gas cloud based upon an inferred low dust temperature , observed elongation of the br-@xmath1  emission along the object s direction of motion , and a claimed tail along the same orbital trajectory as g2 .",
    "this interpretation is particularly interesting because g2 is on a highly eccentric orbit with closest approach to our galaxy s central black hole within the next year , potentially allowing us to observe an unprecedented accretion event onto a supermassive black hole and offer insight into the region surrounding the black hole ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) .    the interpretation of g2 as a gas cloud , however , is not definitive . one challenge for the pure gas cloud scenario is that , given the strong tidal fields in this region and g2 s low self - gravity , g2 needs to have formed quite recently ( @xmath101995 , just prior to the initial observations ; @xcite ) .",
    "since such a gas cloud would be tidally disrupted during its periapse passage in the upcoming year , the gas cloud model implies g2 will be observed over almost the exact extent of its existence .",
    "therefore several alternative scenarios invoking an underlying star have been proposed @xcite . in these scenarios ,",
    "the observed heated gas is posited to be circumstellar , either intrinsic or a consequence of interaction of the star and surrounding ambient gas . in these stellar scenarios ,",
    "g2 not only has existed for timescales much longer than the observed time baseline , but will also survive periapse passage .    regardless of its nature , g2 s properties and possible origin depend critically on its orbital parameters .",
    "these parameters have been estimated from observations with a short time baseline compared to the orbital period ( @xmath1010 vs.@xmath10200 years ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in a very crowded region , making the orbital solution susceptible to biases @xcite .",
    "we therefore present new measurements and analysis of g2 that minimize the effects of source confusion on estimates of g2 s orbital parameters and examine the temporal evolution of g2 s properties .",

    "one complication for measuring the @xmath3 position of g2 in the plane of the sky is that g2 was superimposed on a filament of dust emission during the early- to mid- 2000 s , which caused significant astrometric bias ( see figure [ fig : lp ] ) . to quantify this effect",

    "the background dust emission does not have noticeable motions in the plane of the sky , thus the astrometric bias at these locations in the 2012 image should be representative of the bias at earlier epochs .",
    "the position of the artificial point source was extracted using _",
    "starfinder_.    to constrain the spectral energy distribution of the object , we measured the integrated flux of g2 in the @xmath3 frame ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in contrast with @xcite , but in agreement with @xcite , we detect no @xmath2 counterpart for g2 ; therefore , we performed star planting simulations to determine the @xmath2 upper limit .",
    "we used the br-@xmath1  astrometry of g2 to predict the positions of g2 in the @xmath2 data .",
    "then , an artificial point source was planted at g2 s predicted position in the may 2010 image , when g2 is most isolated ( see figure [ fig : kp ] ) .",
    "using a modified version of the _ starfinder _ algorithm ( boehle et al . _ in prep _ ) , we searched for a point source within a 3 pixel box centered on the planted star , given the psf originally extracted from the may 2010 image .",
    "we fit an orbit to g2 s astrometric positions and rv measurements .",
    "@xmath3-astrometric and rv measurements reported by @xcite were also included ; however , we fit the br-@xmath1  and @xmath3 astrometry separately .",
    "we assumed g2 follows a purely keplerian orbit around the central black hole .",
    "the orbit inference problem aims to find the most likely orbital parameters ( eccentricity , period , time of periapse passage , inclination , position angle of the ascending node , and the longitude of periapse ) given the data .",
    "in addition to g2 s orbital parameters , the parameters of the gravitational potential need to be inferred ( mass and distance to black hole , and its perceived 2d position and 3d velocity ) .",
    "since the observed motion of g2 does not entail enough information to constrain all these parameters , the orbit of s0 - 2 , which has undergone a full orbit , was fit simultaneously and effectively determines the gravitational potential ( see * ? ? ?",
    "compared to earlier publications , we amended our keplerian orbit fitting code to use the bayesian sampler multinest @xcite .",
    "we verified the results are equivalent with our previous monte carlo approach ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "six key results emerge from our analysis of g2 :    * _ apparent positional offset between the br-@xmath1  line emission and @xmath3 continuum emission of g2 : _ the @xmath3 astrometry is not consistent with our br-@xmath1  astrometry , which is reported here for the first time ( see figure [ fig : orb ] ) .",
    "the positional difference can be explained by astrometric bias in the @xmath3 astrometry . in our star planting analysis",
    ", we find the extracted position of an artificial @xmath3 source on the dust filament where g2 is located at early epochs differs from the input positions by an average of @xmath101.2 pix ( 12 mas ) .",
    "this is almost an order of magnitude larger than typical centroiding uncertainties at @xmath3 and the astrometric bias found in a region isolated from extended background flux .",
    "we therefore exclude @xmath3 astrometry from our primary orbital fits . *",
    "_ revised orbital parameters : _ the keplerian orbit derived using br-@xmath1  astrometry differs from the orbit derived using @xmath3 astrometry ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ) by more than can be explained by formal measurement uncertainties ( see figure [ fig : orb ] ) .",
    "we list the most likely orbital parameters from br-@xmath1   in table [ tab : orb ] .",
    "this new orbit for g2 has pushed the closest approach date to march 2014 , has a closer periastron ( @xmath50 , @xmath6 ) and a higher eccentricity ( @xmath51 ) . * _",
    "g2 s compact size : _",
    "g2 s observed size is comparable to the keck angular resolution in almost all our observations ; however , it exhibits marginal spatial extent in our highest quality spectroscopic data set . at this time ( 2006 ) , the observed half - width at half - maximum is @xmath52 after accounting for the observed psf of s0 - 2 ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "g2 also shows a velocity gradient along its orbit , with the most highly redshifted portion of the object closest to the black hole , consistent with what is expected for a tidal interaction event .",
    "the observed spatial extent is consistent with that presented in @xcite , thus the br-@xmath1  spatial extent of g2 along the direction of motion is relatively constant and corresponds to a size on the order of @xmath10100 au . * _ spectral evolution : _ we find an increasing br-@xmath1  line width for g2 , with fwhm measurements ranging from @xmath54 in 2006 to @xmath55 in 2012 ( see table [ tab : obs ] ) .",
    "these measurements are consistent with those presented by @xcite . * _ constant brightness : _ both at @xmath3 and br-@xmath1  the flux of g2 is constant within uncertainties .",
    "the integrated flux of g2 at @xmath3 has an average value of @xmath56 .",
    "the br-@xmath1  line fluxes in 2006 , 2009 , 2010 , and 2012 are @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 of s0 - 2 s continuum flux between 2.17 - 2.18 , respectively .",
    "* _ source color : _ our star planting simulations indicate that the upper @xmath2 magnitude limit of g2 is @xmath61 and is @xmath62 magnitudes deeper than the earlier upper @xmath2 limit imposed on g2 @xcite .",
    "the deeper @xmath2 limit yields a dust temperature below @xmath10500k if g2 is a pure gas cloud . if g2 has an underlying stellar source , a @xmath2 magnitude limit places distinct limits on the luminosity of the star .",
    "this limit is similar to the expected @xmath2 magnitude for a low - mass t tauri star in the galactic center ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , and eliminates a more massive star unless it is shrouded by dust which self - extincts the star at @xmath2 .",

    "the two orbits derived by @xcite differ from each other by more than can be explained with formal measurement uncertainties .",
    "systematic errors in the l astrometry naturally explain the discrepancy . because the offset becomes less significant and the rv measurements play an increasingly dominant role in the orbital modeling , the measurements seem to converge on the solution obtained with the less biased br-@xmath1  astrometry and rv measurements .",
    "there are several implications of the new orbital model parameters .",
    "first , the revised periapse date of march 2014 and the closer periastron are important for the design and interpretation of sgra * monitoring programs designed to test for an increased accretion flow . with a special nrao call for proposals and tremendous attention called to this object , which was originally anticipated to experience periapse in june 2013 ,",
    "more than 30 programs have been approved for the summer of 2013 covering radio to @xmath1-ray wavelengths . while some models predict that a cloud would generate enhanced radio emission from sgra * well in advance of periapse passage ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , none has yet been detected @xcite , although this may not yet be expected with the revised periapse passage .",
    "second , the geometry of the new orbit may call two previously suggested associations into question . most importantly , the previous claimed  tail \" of low surface brightness emission , which was central to the original claim that g2 is a pure gas cloud , is no longer securely affiliated with the compact  head \" , which has been analyzed in this work .",
    "the new orbit also falls 3.5@xmath75 off the plane of the disk of young stars orbiting the central black hole at @xmath100.05 - 2 pc ( @xcite ; yelda et al . _ in prep _ ) which has been suggested as the possible origin of the gas cloud through colliding stellar winds of young stars @xcite or a central stellar source ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "third , the even higher eccentricity provides strong constraints on g2 s origin .",
    "it is notable that a high eccentricity is consistent with the outcome of three body exchanges between a binary system and the central black hole which may explain the dense concentration of b stars ( the s - stars ) in the innermost regions of the galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if a triple star system is invoked rather than a binary , g2 could possibly be the result of a recent merger between two components to produce the observed physical properties ( red , compact , and at times marginally resolved ) and an exchange with the central black hole with the remaining component to produce the observed orbital parameters ( highly eccentric , short period ) .",
    "while we favor a stellar model , this question will be soon addressed , as g2 should remain intact through its periapse if this is indeed correct .",
    "the authors would like to acknowledge the invaluable feedback from conference attendees at workshops where this work has been presented ( aas 221st meeting , keck 20th anniversary celebration , galactic nuclei ringberg workshop ) .",
