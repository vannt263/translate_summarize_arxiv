    "already in 1937 , at the outset of modern solid state physics , de boer and verwey @xcite drew attention to the surprising properties of materials with incompletely filled 3@xmath0-bands .",
    "this observation prompted mott and peierls @xcite to discuss the interaction between the electrons .",
    "ever since transition metal oxides ( tmos ) were investigated intensively @xcite .",
    "it is now well - known that in many materials with partially filled electron shells , such as the 3@xmath0 transition metals v and ni and their oxides , or 4@xmath1 rare - earth metals such as ce , electrons occupy narrow orbitals .",
    "the spatial confinement enhances the effect of the coulomb interaction between the electrons , making them `` strongly correlated '' .",
    "correlation effects can lead to profound quantitative and qualitative changes of the physical properties of electronic systems as compared to non - interacting particles .",
    "in particular , they often respond very strongly to changes in external parameters .",
    "this is expressed by large renormalizations of the response functions of the system , e.g. , of the spin susceptibility and the charge compressibility . in particular",
    ", the interplay between the spin , charge and orbital degrees of freedom of the correlated @xmath0 and @xmath1 electrons and with the lattice degrees of freedom leads to an amazing multitude of ordering phenomena and other fascinating properties , including high temperature superconductivity , colossal magnetoresistance and mott metal - insulator transitions @xcite .",
    "the simplest microscopic model describing interacting electrons in a solid is the one - band , spin-1/2 hubbard model @xcite where the interaction between the electrons is assumed to be so strongly screened that it is purely local .",
    "more generally the hubbard model applies to lattice fermions with a point interaction , such as ultra - cold fermionic atoms in optical lattices where the interaction is indeed extremely short ranged .",
    "the hamiltonian consists of two terms , the kinetic energy @xmath2 and the interaction energy @xmath3 ( here and in the following operators are denoted by a hat ) :    [ vollhardt : g11.7 ] @xmath4 \\hat{h}_0 & = & \\sum_{i , j } \\sum_{\\sigma } t_{ij } \\hat{c}_{i \\sigma}^{+ } \\hat{c}_{j \\sigma}^ { } = \\sum_{\\bm{k } , \\sigma } \\epsilon_{\\bm{k } } \\hat{n}_{\\bm{k } \\sigma}^ { }   \\label{vollhardt : g11.7b } \\\\[10pt ] \\hat{h}_{\\mathrm{i } } & = & u \\sum_{i } \\hat{n}_{i \\uparrow } \\hat{n}_{i \\downarrow } ,   \\label{vollhardt : g11.7c}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 are creation ( annihilation ) operators of fermions with spin @xmath6 at site @xmath7 ( for simplicity denoted by @xmath8 ) , and @xmath9 .",
    "the fourier transform of the kinetic energy in , where @xmath10 is the amplitude for hopping between sites @xmath8 and @xmath11 , involves the dispersion @xmath12 and the momentum distribution operator @xmath13 .",
    "this model provides the basis for most of the theoretical research on correlated electrons during the last decades .",
    "the hubbard model describes an interacting many - body system which can not be solved analytically , except in dimension @xmath14 for nearest - neighbor hopping @xcite . in the absence of exact solutions",
    "there is clearly a great need for reliable , controlled approximation schemes for this model .",
    "however , such approximations are not easy to construct as the following observation shows . when viewed as a function of time a given site of the lattice",
    "will sometimes be empty , singly occupied or doubly occupied . for strong repulsion @xmath15 double occupations are energetically very unfavorable and are therefore strongly suppressed , implying @xmath16 . therefore approximation schemes based on the factorization of the interaction term , e.g. , hartree - fock - type mean - field theories , are generally insufficient to explain the physics of electrons in their paramagnetic phase beyond the limit of weak interactions .",
    "this is due to the fact that in such approximations the interaction is described only as an average , static potential , whereby correlations , i.e. , dynamical many - body effects due to the interaction of individual electrons , are excluded from the beginning .",
    "hence correlation phenomena such as the mott - hubbard metal - insulator transition can not be described by such approximations .",
    "this clearly shows the need for comprehensive approximation schemes , which are applicable for all values of the input parameters , e.g. , coupling parameters and temperature , diagrammatically controlled , and thermodynamically consistent @xcite .      there exists a well - established branch of approximation techniques which makes use of the simplifications that occur when",
    "some parameter is taken to be large ( in fact , infinite ) , e.g. , the length of the spins @xmath17 , the spin degeneracy @xmath18 , the spatial dimension @xmath0 , or the coordination number @xmath19 , i.e. , the number of nearest neighbors of a lattice site",

    "itinerant quantum mechanical models such as the hubbard model and its generalizations are much more complicated than classical , ising - type models .",
    "generally there do not even exist semiclassical approximations for such models that might serve as a starting point for further investigations . under such circumstances",

    "clearly only the scaling @xmath46 ( `` quantum scaling '' ) yields a non - trivial limit @xmath32 for the dos @xcite .",
    "the interaction term in is seen to be purely local and independent of the surrounding ; hence it is independent of the spatial dimension of the system .",
    "consequently , the on - site interaction @xmath15 need not be scaled .",
    "so we see that the scaled hubbard hamiltonian @xmath47 has a nontrivial @xmath31 limit , where both terms , the kinetic energy and the interaction , are of the same order of magnitude and are thereby able to compete ; here @xmath48 denotes nn sites @xmath8 and @xmath11 .",
    "it is this competition between the two terms which leads to interesting many - body physics .",
    "mathematically this is expressed by the fact that the generic matrix elements of the commutator between the kinetic and the interaction part of the hamiltonian do not vanish in the @xmath49 limit .",
    "the quantum scaling was determined within a @xmath50-space formulation , but it can also be derived within a position - space formulation as will be discussed next .",
    "the most important consequence of the scaling is the fact that it leads to significant simplifications in the investigation of hubbard - type lattice models @xcite . to understand this point better",
    "we take a look at the perturbation theory in terms of @xmath15 . at @xmath51 and @xmath52 the kinetic energy of the electrons",
    "is given by @xmath53 here @xmath54 is the one - particle density matrix which can be interpreted as the probability amplitude for hopping from site @xmath11 to site @xmath8 .",
    "the square of its absolute value is proportional to the probability for an electron to hop from @xmath11 to @xmath8 , i.e. , @xmath55 , since site @xmath11 has @xmath56 nn sites @xmath8 .",
    "the sum of @xmath57 over all nn sites @xmath8 of @xmath11 must then yield a @xmath19 or @xmath0 independent constant . in the limit @xmath32",
    "we therefore find @xmath58 since the sum over nn sites in is of @xmath56 , the nn hopping amplitude @xmath45 must obviously be scaled according to for @xmath59 to remain finite in the limit @xmath60 .",
    "hence , as expected , a real - space formulation yields the same results for the required scaling of the hopping amplitude .",
    "the one - particle green function @xmath61 of the non - interacting system obeys the same scaling as @xmath62 .",
    "this follows directly from its definition @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the time ordering operator , and the time evolution of the operators is given by the heisenberg representation .",
    "the one - particle density matrix is obtained as @xmath65 .",
    "if @xmath66 obeys ( [ vollhardt : g11.20 ] ) the one - particle green function must follow the same scaling at all times since this property does not dependent on the time evolution and the quantum mechanical representation .",
    "the fourier transform @xmath61 also preserves this property .",
    "it is important to realize that , although @xmath67 vanishes for @xmath32 , the particles are _ not _ localized , but are still mobile . indeed , even in the limit @xmath32 the off - diagonal elements of @xmath68 contribute , since a particle may hop to @xmath0 nearest neighbors with reduced amplitude @xmath69 . for general",
    "@xmath70 one finds @xcite @xmath71 is the length of @xmath72 in the so - called `` new york metric '' ( also called `` taxi cab metric '' , since particles only hop along horizontal or vertical lines , never along a diagonal ) .    it is the property which is the origin of all simplifications arising in the limit @xmath73 .",
    "in particular , it implies the collapse of all connected , irreducible perturbation theory diagrams in position space @xcite",
    ". in general , any two vertices which are connected by more than two separate paths will collapse onto the same site .",
    "in particular , the external vertices of any irreducible self - energy diagram are always connected by three separate paths and hence always collapse . as a consequence",
    "the full irreducible self - energy becomes a purely local quantity @xcite , but retains its dynamics @xcite    [ vollhardt : g11.23 ] @xmath74 in the paramagnetic phase we may write @xmath75 .",
    "the fourier transform of @xmath76 is then momentum - independent @xmath77 this leads to tremendous simplifications in all many - body calculations for the hubbard model and related models .",
    "it should be noted that a @xmath50-independence of @xmath78 was sometimes _ assumed _ as a convenient approximation ( `` local approximation '' ) @xcite .",
    "here we identified the limit where this is indeed exact .      in the case of more general interactions than the hubbard interaction , e.g. , nearest - neighbor interactions such as    @xmath79    the interaction constant has to be scaled , too , in the limit @xmath32 . in the case of , which has the form of a classical interaction , the `` classical '' scaling @xmath80 is required .",

    "hence nonlocal interactions only contribute via their hartree contribution , which is purely static .",
    "this gives the hubbard interaction a unique role : of all interactions for fermionic lattice models only the purely local hubbard interaction remains dynamical in the limit @xmath73 @xcite .      due to the @xmath50-independence of the irreducible self - energy , ,",

    "it not only reproduces all exactly solvable limits , such as the non - interacting ( @xmath88 ) and the atomic ( @xmath278 ) limit , but also well - known approximation schemes for interacting bosons .",
    "for example , by neglecting all terms containing the hybridization function in the local action one obtains the mean - field theory of fisher _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite ; for a detailed discussion see @xcite .",
    "the solution of the self - consistent bosonic impurity problem defined by the b - dmft equations requires new theoretical / computational methods .",
    "so far exact diagonalization @xcite and continuous - time qmc @xcite were employed .",
    "thereby the bosonic hubbard model was solved on the bethe lattice for finite @xcite and infinite @xcite coordination number @xmath19 as well as on a simple - cubic lattice @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram of correlated bosons on a simple - cubic lattice computed by the bosonic dmft was found to agree with that obtained by numerically exact qmc to within 2% @xcite .",
    "the b - dmft is expected to be a valuable approximation scheme for the investigation of lattice bosons in situations where exact numerical computations are difficult to perform or inefficient , as in the case of bosons with disorder or many internal degrees of freedom , and for bose - fermi mixtures @xcite .",
    "recently the study of strongly correlated many - body systems out of equilibrium has received much attention @xcite .",
    "this is motivated in particular by experimental progress in the investigation of ultra - cold atomic gases @xcite and time - resolved pump - probe spectroscopy on strongly correlated materials @xcite .",
    "in general the real - time dynamics of correlated systems can be described by the extension of dmft to nonequilibrium , provided that they are dominated by local temporal fluctuations and spatial correlations are not crucial . in nonequilibrium dmft",
    "an effective impurity problem is formulated using the keldysh formalism @xcite , and as in equilibrium dmft this mapping onto a single site becomes exact in the limit of infinite dimensions . for the hubbard model in nonequilibrium",
    "the single - site dmft action reads @xmath279 where the keldysh contour @xmath280 runs from @xmath281 to @xmath282 on the real time axis , back to @xmath281 , and finally to @xmath283 along the imaginary time axis @xcite .",
    "the first term contains the local part of the hamiltonian , e.g. , @xmath284 for a time - dependent interaction .",
    "the second term involves the hybridization function @xmath285 which couples the impurity to a time - dependent bath which must be determined self - consistently .",
    "local contour - ordered correlation functions such as the green function @xmath286 are obtained from the action ( [ vollhardt : noneqaction ] ) as expectation values @xmath287",
    "@xmath182 @xmath288/{\\mathcal{z}}$ ] at the appropriate times , where @xmath289 is the contour - ordering operator . for the hubbard model",
    "this evaluation is the most demanding part of nonequilibrium dmft and can so far be done with real - time quantum monte carlo methods @xcite for not too long times , and for sufficiently large @xmath15 using a self - consistent perturbation expansion around the atomic limit @xcite . for the falicov - kimball model ,",
    "on the other hand , closed equations of motion govern the impurity green function @xcite , which can be solved on the real time axis .",
    "the hybridization function @xmath285 in eq .   must be determined self - consistently by computing the local self - energy @xmath290 from the dyson equation of the impurity model , calculating the momentum - dependent green function of the lattice model from the lattice dyson equation , integrating over momentum to obtain the local lattice green function , and finally equating it with the impurity green function .",
    "while this procedure is necessary for a gaussian or other general dos , for a semielliptical dos the self - energy can be eliminated and @xmath291 expressed directly in terms of @xmath231 @xcite .",
    "nonequilibrium dmft was used to obtain the response of time - resolved photoemission @xcite and optical spectroscopy @xcite in correlated systems in terms of green functions of the electronic system .",
    "the falicov - kimball and hubbard models were studied in the presence of dc and ac electric fields @xcite , as well as for abrupt @xcite or slow changes @xcite of the interaction parameter as a function of time .    as an example , we consider a sudden change ( `` quench '' ) in the interation parameter of the hubbard model from @xmath15 @xmath182 0 ( i.e. , with the non - interacting ground state as initial state ) to finite values of @xmath15 for times @xmath45 @xmath292 @xmath125 . for this case",
    "the dmft equations were solved numerically for the paramagnetic phase and a semielliptic dos @xcite . in the following discussion",
    "the bandwidth is equal to @xmath293 , and time is thus measured in units of @xmath294 , e.g. , on the order of femto - seconds for a bandwidth on the order of ev .",
    "an interesting question is whether such an isolated system can thermalize due to the many - body interaction alone , i.e. , whether at least some of its properties are the same as for an equilibrium system with the same energy  @xcite . before the quench",
    "the momentum distribution is a step function , and the fermi surface discontinuity @xmath295 remains nonzero for a finite time after the quench . for quenches to @xmath15 @xmath296 @xmath297",
    "the momentum discontinuity first reaches a so - called prethermalization plateau for @xmath45 @xmath296 5 due to the vicinity of the integrable point at @xmath88 .",
    "this plateau in @xmath295 is given to good accuracy by @xmath298  @xcite , where @xmath19 is the fermi - liquid quasiparticle weight _ in equilibrium _ at zero temperature and for interaction @xmath15 .",
    "this value and also the transient behavior at short times is precisely predicted by second - order unitary perturbation theory in @xmath15  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the double occupation essentially relaxes to its thermal value on this timescale , showing that the potential energy ( and therefore also the kinetic energy ) relax quicker than the occupation of individual states . for large @xmath15",
    "the behavior is different , showing strong so - called collapse - and - revival oscillations with approximate frequency @xmath299 .",
    "they stem from the vicinity of the atomic limit ( i.e. , zero hopping amplitude ) , for which the propagator @xmath300 is exactly periodic with period @xmath299  @xcite . for finite",
    "hopping ( small compared to @xmath15 ) these oscillations are damped and decay on timescales of order @xmath301 .",
    "the oscillations of the double occupation are not centered at its thermal value , but rather at a different value that can be derived from strong - coupling perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the situation is thus similar to that at small coupling in the sense that the relaxation to the thermal state is delayed because the system is stuck in a metastable state close to an integrable point .",
    "however , both the weak - coupling prethermalization plateau in @xmath302 as well as the strong - coupling oscillations vanish in a narrow region of interaction parameters @xmath15 near @xmath303 @xcite . for quenches of @xmath15 to approximately this value the system thermalizes rapidly : both the momentum distribution and thus also the double occupation ( due to energy conservation after quench ) relax to their thermal values . in fact the retarded nonequilibrium green function relaxes to the corresponding equilibrium function  @xcite , so that all observables that can be obtained from it tend to the thermal value predicted by equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "in other words , for quenches to interaction values in the vicinity of @xmath15 @xmath304 @xmath303 the isolated system indeed thermalizes rapidly due to the many - body interactions .",
    "many interesting questions remain open in this context , e.g. , how thermalization depends on the parameters of the system .",
    "we refer to the reviews  @xcite for further discussion .",
    "due to the intensive international research over the last two decades the dmft has quickly developed into a powerful method for the investigation of electronic systems with strong correlations .",
    "it provides a comprehensive , non - perturbative and thermodynamically consistent approximation scheme for the investigation of finite - dimensional systems ( in particular for dimension @xmath26 ) , and is particularly useful for the study of problems where perturbative approaches are inapplicable . for this reason",
    "the dmft has now become the standard mean - field theory for fermionic correlation problems , including cold atoms in optical lattices  @xcite .",
    "the study of models in nonequilibrium using an appropriate generalization of dmft has become yet another fascinating new research area  @xcite .    until a few years ago research into correlated electron systems concentrated on homogeneous bulk systems .",
    "dmft investigations of systems with internal or external inhomogeneities such as thin films and multi - layered nanostructures are still very new  @xcite .",
    "they are particularly important in view of the novel types of functionalities of such systems , which may have important applications in electronic devices . here",
    "the dmft and its non - local extensions @xcite will certainly become very useful .    in particular , the development of the _ ab initio _ band - structure calculation technique referred to as lda+dmft has proved to be a breakthrough in the investigation of electronically correlated materials .",
    "it provided already important insights into the spectral and magnetic properties of correlated electron materials @xcite .",
    "clearly , this approach has a great potential for further developments .",
    "indeed , it is not hard to foresee that the lda+dmft framework will eventually develop into a comprehensive _ ab initio _ approach which is able to describe , and even predict , the properties of complex correlated materials .",
