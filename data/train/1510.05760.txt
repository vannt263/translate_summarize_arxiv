    "most galaxies are inferred to harbor supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) of masses in the range of @xmath0 at their center @xcite , based on observations of stellar proper motion @xcite , stellar velocity dispersion @xcite or accretion luminosity @xcite .",
    "cold gas triggers active galactic nuclei ( agns ) which produce intense radiation and powerful outflows in a minority of all galaxies , whereas the nuclei of most galaxies do not exhibit significant activities @xcite .",
    "tidal disruption events ( tdes ) provide a distinct opportunity to probe dormant smbhs in inactive galaxies .",
    "most tdes take place when a distant star is perturbed into a parabolic orbit approaching close enough to the smbh to be ripped apart by its gravitational tidal force @xcite .",
    "the subsequent accretion of the debris stream of gas falling back to the smbh produces a characteristic flare with a super - eddington accretion rate for a timescale of weeks @xcite .",
    "recent observation of swift j164449.3 + 573451 showed that relativistic jets are associated with some tdes @xcite .",
    "candidates for tdes have also been observed at x - ray , ultraviolet , and optical wavelengths @xcite , although the observed light curves and spectra do not always match the simplest theoretical expectations @xcite .",
    "binary smbhs with a sub - parsec ( @xmath1 ) separation are considered to be the end product of a galaxy merger before the two black holes finally coalesce @xcite .",
    "the merger of two smbhs processes through three main stages @xcite : first , the smbhs sink towards each other via dynamical friction on the surrounding stars and gas .",
    "once their separation drops below a parsec , a hard binary forms @xcite and tightens further due to other mechanisms until gravitational wave emission takes over @xcite",
    ". the observed tde rate on single smbhs is @xmath2 per galaxy @xcite , although the recent theoretical works based on two - body relaxation impliy the tde rate could be one - order of magnitude higher @xcite .",
    "however , smbh binaries are expected to exhibit an enhanced tde rate of up to @xmath3 from chaotic orbital evolution and the kozai - lidov effect @xcite .",
    "recent work suggests that multiple tdes may occur in merging smbh binaries with a rate of up to a few times over an observing period of five years with the _ large synoptic survey telescope _ ( lsst ) @xcite .",
    "accretion disks around smbhs are predicted to be gravitationally unstable at large radii where they fragment into stars or planets owing to their self - gravity @xcite .",
    "similarly , a circumbinary disk could form stars in its outskirts . hence",
    ", a self - gravitating circumbinary disk would naturally lead to be an enhanced tde rate @xcite .",
    "in addition , a circumbinary disk could grind the orbits of background stars and trigger additional tdes @xcite . through both mechanisms",
    ", stars would migrate to the inner edge of the circumbinary disk , and subsequently approach both black holes through the lagrange points ( l2 or l3 ) of the binary .    here ,",
    "we study how stars migrating through the binary lagrange points are tidally disrupted by the smbhs . in section  [ sec : sph - code ] , we describe the numerical method used in our simulations of these tdes .",
    "we then analyze our numerical results in section  [ sec : tds ] .",
    "finally , we summarize our main conclusions in section  [ sec : con ] .",
    "we consider a system composed of a star orbiting around a circular smbh binary with mass ratio @xmath4 .",
    "the star originates from the massive circumbinary disk @xcite .",
    "the disk makes stars which migrate inwards and approach the lagrange points around the binary ( l2 or l3 ) via a mass stream from the disk s inner edge @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the star can be treated as a restricted three - body problem .",
    "we solve numerically the motion of the star as a test particle in the binary potential .    in the test - particle limit , the star is initially located just inside the l2 point with a keplerian velocity , and then is trapped by the binary potential and freely moves between two black holes inside the inner roche - lobe of the binary .",
    "the outside of the inner lobe is marked by the shaded area of figure  [ fig : bsmbhs ] as the forbidden zone @xcite .",
    "the star is tidally disrupted once it enters the tidal disruption radius : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the smbh mass , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the star s mass and radius , and @xmath9 is the schwarzschild radius .",
    "the corresponding orbit is depicted in figure  [ fig : bsmbhs ] .",
    "the fate of the tidally disrupted star is similar to that of an eccentric tde , in which the tde accretion rate deviates significantly from the standard @xmath10 time evolution @xcite .",
    "our simulations are performed with a three - dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations are integrated using a second - order runge - kutta - fehlberg integrator with individual time steps for each particle , leading to substantial savings in time for a large dynamic range of timescales .",
    "we also use a variable smoothing length scheme to find the relevant spatial resolution in our code , but ignore the term proportional to the gradient of the smoothing length .",
    "we adopt standard the sph artificial viscosity parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the photon diffusion timescale of the stellar debris is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the debris scale height and @xmath15 is the optical depth for electron scattering with @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is surface density of the stellar debris with the fiducial value of @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the radius and width of the debris ring .",
    "recent three - dimensional radiation magneto - hydrodynamic simulations showed that the magnetic buoyancy induced through the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) @xcite provides an efficient radiative cooling mechanism for super - eddington accretion flows @xcite . in this regime ,",
    "their preliminary simulations indicate that the radiative cooling speed is determined by the sound speed of the radiation . in our simulation",
    ", the stellar debris loses its orbital energy and then circularizes via a shock into an accretion flow at a super - eddington rate at @xmath21 .",
    "the initial radiation energy density is @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and so the radiation sound speed is estimated to be @xmath25 .",
    "thus , the resulting cooling timescale @xmath26 is estimated to be @xmath27 , shorter than the heating timescale by the shock @xmath28 .",
    "it takes several dynamical times for the magnetic field to grow via the mri , after which the efficient cooling reduces the thickness of the debris streams .",
    "thus , we adopt a simple polytropic equation of state with @xmath29 , which ensures that the radiative cooling is efficient , throughout our simulation .",
    "we model the initial star as a polytropic gas sphere with @xmath29 in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the star is set in motion through the gravitational field of the smbh binary with the following parameters : @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "the simulations follows @xmath35 million sph particles for @xmath36 binary orbital periods , where a single period @xmath37 .",
    "figure  [ fig : snap ] shows the evolutionary sequence of density maps for the stellar debris of a tde around the smbh binary . a star approaching the binary from the l2 point",
    "is tidally disrupted by the secondary black hole .",
    "part of the stellar debris is not gravitationally bound , while the rest accretes onto the secondary smbh .",
    "the unbound debris moves chaotically in the binary potential and forms accretion disks around both black holes by transferring mass along the potential valley through the l1 point .",
    "the resulting mass accretion rates are shown in figure  [ fig : lc]a .",
    "the green and red dotted lines show the bolometric light curves of the primary and secondary black holes , respectively .",
    "the luminosities are derived as @xmath38 with @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the mass accretion rates of the primary and secondary black holes based on the simulation .",
    "the accretion rates are estimated at the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit of a schwarzschild black hole , @xmath42 .",
    "the black and blue lines show the bolometric light curves , including the relativistic doppler beaming effect due to the orbital motion of the binary @xcite , @xmath43 ^ 4\\,\\,\\,(i=1,2)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the lorentz factor and the orbital speed , respectively , and @xmath46 with @xmath47 being the orbital frequency and @xmath48 being the inclination angle between the line - of - sight and the binary orbital plane , which is assumed to be @xmath49 in the calculation .",
    "note that @xmath50 intrinsically shows the bursty nature and is more than one order of magnitude smaller than @xmath41 , since the angular momentum of the stellar debris relative to the primary black hole is much larger than that of the secondary black hole .",
    "in addition , the periodicity of the bolometric light curves of the secondary black hole is enhanced by relativistic beaming .",
    "figure  [ fig : lc]b shows the power spectrum of the total light curve with relativistic beaming .",
    "the blue solid and red dashed lines mark the simulated and predicted power spectra , respectively .",
    "the blue line indicates a sharp peak at the binary orbital frequency .",
    "since the full - width at half maximum of the peak is @xmath51 , the shift of the peak over time due to orbital decay should be larger than @xmath52 in order to be easily noticeable . for a fiducial tde rate of @xmath53 per year",
    ", a second tde would likely occur 50 years after the first tde , and the shift in the power spectrum due to the orbital decay by gravitational wave emission will be noticeable , as shown by the red dashed line of the figure .",
    "if the peak is sampled by n data points , then the shift in the peak would be detectable over a period shorter by @xmath54 .",
    "our simulation implies that it would be possible to measure the orbital decay by gravitational wave emission through the shift of the peak in the power spectrum .",
    "the tde rate for a binary smbh system is dictated by the supply rate of stars from the outer region of the circumbinary disk to the inner cavity .",
    "the formation rate of the solar mass stars is estimated to be of order @xmath55 in the self - gravitating accretion disk @xcite .",
    "the rate at which the orbits of disk - crossing stars are brought into the inner cavity could also be controlled by the mass accretion rate of the disk @xcite . in both cases",
    ", the stars should migrate to the inner cavity on the accretion timescale .",
    "therefore , the expected tde rate ranges betwseen @xmath56 and the eddington rate , @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the mass - to - radiation conversion efficiency .",
    "the feasibility of detecting the shift in the peak of the power spectrum depends primarily on the semi - major axis of the binary at the first tde .",
    "we consider a circular binary whose coalescence timescale due to gravitational wave emission is given by @xcite , @xmath59 setting @xmath60 and @xmath61 as the semi - major axes of the binary at the first and second tdes , respectively , the time difference between two tdes , @xmath62 , needs to satisfy the condition that the normalized frequency is significantly increased , namely @xmath63 thus , the upper limit on a value of semi - major axis @xmath60 is , @xmath64 ^{1/4}. \\label{eq : ac}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    when @xmath65 is shorter than the viscous timescale evaluated at the inner edge of the circumbinary disk , the binary is viscously decoupled from the circumbinary disk @xcite .",
    "the viscous timescale measured at the inner edge of the circumbinary disk is given by @xmath66 with the inner radius being @xmath67 @xcite , where the disk viscosity @xmath68 , expressed in terms of the sound speed @xmath69 and the shakura - sunyaev viscosity parameter @xmath70 .",
    "based on the assumption that the circumbinary disk is a standard disk , the decoupling radius is obtained by equating @xmath71 to @xmath72 , giving @xmath73^{5/13 } \\left(\\frac{0.1}{\\alpha_{\\rm ss}}\\right)^{4/5 } \\left(\\frac{m_{\\rm bh}}{m_\\odot}\\right)^{1/13 } \\left(\\frac{\\dot{m}}{\\epsilon\\dot{m}_{\\rm edd}}\\right)^{-2/13 } , \\label{eq : adec}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath74 is the sound speed for typical parameters .",
    "figure  [ fig : a0freq]a shows the black - hole mass dependence of the decoupling radius .",
    "the decoupling radius is clearly larger than the fiducial semi - major axis @xmath75 of our simulation for @xmath76 . because no significant binary - disk interaction occurs after decoupling",
    ", it is impossible for gas to accretes onto the smbhs .",
    "however , dynamical friction between gas and stars near the inner edge of the circumbinary disk allows stars to lose their angular momenta and fall into the smbhs @xcite .",
    "this process would occur on the dynamical timescale , which is much shorter than the migration timescale of stars on the circumbinary disk , and so the tde rate can be still comparable to the eddington rate . thus , a star can be supplied to a smbh binary system at a high rate of up to @xmath77 @xcite , even if the system has no cirucmbinary disk because of a poor gas environment or because of decoupling .",
    "the circumbinary disks can supply not only stars but also gas to the smbhs before decoupling .",
    "recent numerical simulations show that the rate of gas accretion from the circumbinary disk is modulated by the orbital period @xcite .",
    "detection of the orbital decay based on the shift in the power spectrum of the light curves can also , in principle , be inferred in such a system . however",
    ", if the semi - major axis of the binary is larger than the decoupling radius , the shift of power spectrum is undetectable because it is too small to be identified observationally ( @xmath78 in figure  [ fig : a0freq]b ) .",
    "this implies that only periodic signals caused by tidal disruption events around the smbh binaries with the semi - major axis shorter than the decoupling radius can provide a detectable shift in the power spectrum .",
    "we have simulated the tidal disruption of a star by a circular smbh binary with a @xmath79 mass ratio .",
    "our simulation indicates that the mass accretion rate of the secondary black hole is higher than that of the primary black hole .",
    "the resulting total bolometric luminosity shows a strong relativistic beaming effect due to the enhanced line - of - sight velocity of the secondary black hole .",
    "therefore , the power spectrum naturally shows a sharp peak at the orbital frequency ( see figure  [ fig : lc]b ) . observing two tde flares separated apart by decades would allow to detect the orbital decay of the binary by gravitational wave emission .",
    "given that a typical galaxy encounters a merger with a mass ratio 1:10 once per @xmath80 gyr @xcite , the probability for finding a corresponding smbh binary in the last century od its life before coalescence is @xmath81 .",
    "the lsst will survey @xmath82 galaxies for variability and be ideally suited for identifying candidate source for follow - up monitoring that will seek our predicted periodic signal .",
