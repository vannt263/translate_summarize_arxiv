    "a _ triple system _ @xmath18 is a pair @xmath19 consisting of a vertex set @xmath20 and a family of unordered triples @xmath21 .",
    "a _ steiner triple system _ is a partial triple system @xmath22 so that , for each pair of vertices @xmath23 and @xmath24 , there is some @xmath25 so that @xmath26 is an edge of @xmath22 .",

    "@xmath18 is a triple @xmath27 consisting of a vertex set @xmath20 , a family of unordered triples @xmath21 , and a total ordering @xmath28 on @xmath20 .",
    "we say that an ordered triple system @xmath18 has the _ sum property _ if , whenever @xmath29 and @xmath30 are two edges with respective maxima @xmath31 and @xmath32 , @xmath33    * examples * :    1 .",
    "let @xmath34 , and , for each @xmath35 , let @xmath36 be an edge of @xmath37 .",
    "we call this the _ schur triple system _ , and denote it by @xmath38 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath38 has the sum property .",
    "this shows immediately that the sum property does not imply finite colorability , since schur s theorem says that any coloring @xmath39 $ ] with finitely many colors @xmath31 admits a monochromatic @xmath40 , i.e. , @xmath41 .",
    "such a map is called a ( weak ) hypergraph coloring .",
    "a map @xmath39 $ ] so that @xmath42 instead of just @xmath43 is known as a `` strong coloring , '' and corresponds exactly to a proper vertex coloring of the complement of the `` leave , '' i.e. , the graph of all pairs contained in some triple @xmath44 . graph and set theorists sometimes call this the `` shadow '' graph of @xmath18 , and denote it by the topological boundary operator @xmath45 .",
    "topologists variously know this graph as the `` @xmath9-skeleton '' as well .",
    "it is clear that any order - preserving isomorphic image of a triple system with the sum property also has the sum property , and that any subhypergraph of a triple system with the sum property does as well .",
    "for example , we define the _ pythagorean triple system _ @xmath17 by @xmath46 and @xmath47 . since we can embed @xmath17 into @xmath38 monotonically by the map @xmath48 , @xmath17 has the sum property as well .",
    "it is a wide open problem to determine whether @xmath17 has a weak coloring .",
    "( it is even open whether it is strongly colorable . )",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , @xmath17 is actually linear , i.e. , no two edges intersect in more than one vertex .",
    "a special subsystem of @xmath17 is the _ primitive pythagorean triple system _",
    "@xmath49 consisting of all pythagorean triples which are relatively prime .",
    "that is , @xmath46 and @xmath50 it is easy to see that @xmath17 is actually a union of dilates of @xmath49 by each @xmath51 .",
    "however , @xmath49 is bipartite : the parity coloring @xmath52 provides a @xmath8-coloring .",
    "we define a special class of partial triple systems called `` bicycles . ''",
    "the @xmath6-bicycle has @xmath53 vertices and @xmath54 edges .",
    "its vertices are the elements of @xmath55 and two `` antipodes '' @xmath56 and @xmath57 ; its edges are all triples of the form @xmath58 and @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "the @xmath8-bicycle is also known as the _ pasch configuration _ , or _",
    "quadrilateral _ : the six - point partial triple system consisting of the edges @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "the @xmath14-bicycle appears in the literature as the `` hexagon '' ( e.g. , @xcite ) : eight points @xmath65 with edges @xmath66 .",
    "the following proposition follows immediately from well - known results in the theory of triple systems .",
    "( see , for example , @xcite . ) for completeness , we give a short proof .    [ prop : stshasbicycle ] if @xmath67 are vertices of nontrivial steiner triple system @xmath22 , then there is a @xmath6-bicycle for some @xmath68 in @xmath22 with antipodes @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "define the `` link '' @xmath71 of a vertex @xmath72 ( also known as the `` star '' of @xmath23 ) to be the set of pairs @xmath73 so that @xmath74 is an edge of @xmath22 . for some @xmath75 ,",
    "@xmath76 is a triple of @xmath22 , so @xmath77 consists of a matching @xmath78 on @xmath79 , plus the edge @xmath80 ; similarly , @xmath81 consists of a matching @xmath82 on @xmath79 , plus the edge @xmath83 .",
    "the union of @xmath78 and @xmath82 is composed of even - length cycles of length at least @xmath84 ; any one of these forms a bicycle with antipodes @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "we now define two weaker implicants of the sum property .",
    "we say that an ordered triple system has the _ upper sum property _",
    "if , whenever @xmath29 and @xmath85 are two edges with @xmath31 and @xmath32 their respective maxima , @xmath86 this clearly follows from the sum property by setting @xmath87 .",
    "we say that an ordered triple system _ lower sum property _ if , whenever @xmath29 and @xmath88 are two edges with @xmath31 as both of their maxima , @xmath89 to see that the lower sum property follows from the sum property , suppose that @xmath90 but @xmath91",
    ". then it follows that the maximal element of @xmath29 is greater than the maximal element of @xmath88 , whence @xmath92 , a contradiction .",
    "we say that two pairs of integers @xmath73 and @xmath93 are `` nesting '' if @xmath94 .",
    "then it is possible to restate the upper sum property as the fact that , for each vertex @xmath23 , the subset of the link graph @xmath95 intersecting @xmath96 is a non - nesting matching . the lower sum property may be similarly restated as the fact that , for each vertex @xmath23 , the subset of the link graph @xmath95 induced by @xmath97 is fully nested matching , i.e. , for each two edges @xmath98 and @xmath99 , @xmath98 is nested in @xmath99 or vice versa .",
    "[ prop : noquadupper ] if @xmath18 has the upper sum property , and @xmath100 is a @xmath6-bicycle in @xmath18 , then the maximal two points of @xmath100 are not its antipodes .",
    "let @xmath101 be a @xmath6-bicycle , and suppose @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the maximal two points of @xmath100 .",
    "we may assume without loss of generality that @xmath102 .",
    "then the maximal elements of all triples are @xmath56 or @xmath57 ( depending on which antipode they contain ) .",
    "therefore , since @xmath103 , @xmath104 for each @xmath60 .",
    "however , the quantities above are modulo @xmath105 , whence the set of resulting inequalities is circular and therefore inconsistent .",
    "[ prop : noquadlower ] if @xmath18 has the lower sum property , and @xmath100 is a @xmath6-bicycle in @xmath18 , then the maximal two points of @xmath100 are not its antipodes .",

    "we may assume without loss of generality that @xmath102 .",
    "then the maximal elements of all triples are @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( depending on which antipode they contain ) .",
    "since @xmath58 is an edge for each @xmath60 , the @xmath106 pairs @xmath107 are a matching , and they are linear ordered by nesting , by the lower sum property .",
    "suppose , without loss of generality , that @xmath108 is the outermost matching edge and @xmath109 , so that , for all @xmath110 , @xmath111 .",
    "the pairs @xmath112 and @xmath113 are also nested , since they arise from the edges @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "hence , @xmath116 or @xmath117 , and each of these possibilities contradicts @xmath109 .",
    "if @xmath18 has the full , lower , or upper sum property , then it does not contain any steiner triple system .",
    "suppose @xmath18 contained some steiner triple system @xmath118 .",
    "let @xmath56 and @xmath57 be the maximal elements of @xmath118 . then @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the antipodes of some bicycle , by lemma [ prop : stshasbicycle ]",
    ". however , this contradicts propositions [ prop : noquadupper ] and/or [ prop : noquadlower ] .",
    "note that a triple system with the sum property can actually contain a quadrilateral : for example , @xmath38 contains @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 .",
    "here we collect a few open questions regarding @xmath17 that we consider interesting .",
    "since the sum properties imply the nonexistence of some configurations with chromatic number @xmath14 , is it possible to exploit them to find a coloring with few colors ?",
    "is @xmath17 strongly colorable ? or does it contain arbitrarily large cliques ?    does @xmath17 contain @xmath15 minus a single triple ?",
