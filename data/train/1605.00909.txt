    "the distance to the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) is of great astrophysical importance for at least two reasons .",
    "firstly , the lmc serves as the best anchor to establish the zero point of the extragalactic distance scale , and a variety of distance indicators , including classical cepheids , rr lyrae stars , red clump stars , and the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) method can be calibrated in the lmc with better accuracy than in any other galaxy , at the present time .",
    "secondly , the lmc represents an ideal laboratory for the detailed study of different stellar populations , given its distance of about 50 kpc which is far enough to see , in a first approximation , all its objects at the same distance , and at the same time close enough to study in great detail even its faint stellar populations .",
    "given these advantages , many astrophysical studies of lmc stars , stellar clusters and gaseous regions have been carried out over the past century ; in particular , many attempts have been made to determine a precise and accurate distance to the lmc in order to put the luminosities and sizes of its components onto an absolute scale .",
    "it has proved extremely difficult to establish an accurate and reliable distance to the lmc , given the different , and often large systematic uncertainties on the different methods which have been applied to solve this task .",
    "a breakthrough came with the discovery of a very special and rare class of eclipsing binaries in the magellanic clouds by the ogle project @xcite .",
    "these systems consist of two usually quite similar red giant components , and offer two very important advantages over the ( usually brighter and thus easier - to - observe ) early - type eclipsing binaries in the context of distance determination : they can be easily and precisely analyzed using standard techniques and without resorting to uncertain theoretical predictions , and the angular diameters of the component stars , and hence their distances , can be precisely determined from a surface brightness - color relation which is accurately determined for late - type stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but not for early - type stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a first system of this class has been analyzed by @xcite , and led to a distance accurate to 3% , including the ( well - determined ) systematic uncertainties . due to the hard work of the araucaria project team ,",
    "four years later data for these hard - to - observe systems ( due to their long orbital periods and relative faintnesses ) became ready for the analysis of eight late - type systems ; their analysis led to a lmc barycenter distance being accurate to 2.2% ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter p13 ) which currently represents the most accurate distance to the lmc ever measured .    in an effort to improve the lmc distance determination even further , mostly in the quest of improving the hubble constant to an accuracy of 1% with the cepheid - sn ia method ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , our group is currently observing more late - type systems in the lmc .",
    "one of these systems , ogle - lmc - ecl-25658 , is particularly useful for deriving a precise distance : it is relatively bright , both components have very similar temperatures , and the deep and total eclipses allow for very precise determinations of the stellar radii and dynamical parameters .",
    "the ( @xmath9 ) colors of the component stars allow , in turn , for a very precise determination of their surface brightnesses , and in tandem with the radii their distances .",
    "some basic information on the system ( coordinates , observed magnitudes and the orbital period ) is given in table 1 .",
    "the system is different from those systems studied in p13 in the sense that its location in the lmc is quite far ( 3.5 degrees ) from the geometrical center of the lmc and the line of nodes ( the model of * ? ? ?",
    "we present a detailed analysis of this system in this paper , derive its orbital parameters and very accurate physical parameters for the component red giants in the system , and derive its distance which , corrected with the geometrical model of van der marel et al . , strengthens the lmc distance determination with late - type eclipsing binaries of p13 .",
    "the results also add to our database of physical parameters of red giants ( masses to better than 1% , radii , luminosities ) in the magellanic clouds , which eventually will allow a much improved understanding of the physics , and stellar evolution of red giants in environments of different metallicities .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way : in section  2 , we present and discuss the different sets of observations we used for this study . in section  3",
    "we describe the details of data analysis and in section  4 we give a summary of derived physical parameters .",
    "section  5 describes the distance determination , and section  6 contains the conclusions and final remarks .",
    "the system was detected during the course of the ogle iii project and identified as an eclipsing binary system by @xcite .",
    "its position relative to the lmc is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "optical photometry in the johnson - cousins filters was obtained with the warsaw 1.3 m telescope at las campanas observatory in the course of the third @xcite and fourth @xcite phase of the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) project @xcite .",

    "the orbit is significanlty eccentric and using the lc module of the wd code we computed a number of trial light curves and radial velocity curves to obtain good starting values of stellar radii and the orbital parameters .",
    "as the eclipses are total , and the separation of the components is relatively large the orbital inclination @xmath23 must be close to 90 degrees .",

    "contributions to the statistical error on the distance modulus determination are : uncertainty on the sum of the radii ( 0.012 mag ) , uncertainty on exctinction ( 0.013 mag ) , error of semimajor axis ( 0.008 mag ) , out - of - eclipse variability ( 0.010 mag ) , and combined error on photometry ( 0.006 mag ) . combination of these contributions in quadrature yield 0.023 mag .",
    "we assumed this value as the total statistical uncertainty on the distance .",
    "the sources of systematic uncertainty in our method are the following : the uncertainty on the empirical calibration of the surface brightness - color relation of di benedetto ( 2005 ) ( 0.041 mag ) , uncertainty on the extinction ( 0.010 mag ) , metallicity dependence on the surface brightness - color relation ( 0.004 mag ) , and the uncertainties on the zero points of the v and k band photometries ( 0.010 mag and 0.015 mag , respectively ) . combining these in quadrature",
    ", we obtain a total systematic error of 0.046 mag .",
    "we have obtained stellar parameters for the eclipsing binary ogle - lmc - ecl-25658 . although this is an extragalactic object the absolute dimensions of the system , and the physical parameters of the component stars are determined with very high precision ( better than 1% ) .",
    "the system is composed of two giants of equal masses and similar temperatures but having significantly different radii and rates of axial rotation .",
    "as such this is probably an interesting case of differential stellar evolution of two identical stars in which some secondary evolution parameters ( like e.g. initial rate of rotation ) has led to the observed present day differences .",
    "we leave this problem for a future study , including a detailed comparison with evolutionary models .",
    "the distance to the system is measured to be @xmath117 kpc ( total uncertainty ) , i.e. it has a fractional accuracy better than 3% .",
    "the eclipsing binary is located relatively far from the barycenter of the lmc and lies on eastern side of the galaxy .",
    "its position is exactly opposite to the systems analysed by p13 which are located close to the barycenter , and the western part of the lmc . because of this our distance determination serves as a perfect check of the consistency of our method and the assumed spatial orientation of the lmc disc ( van marel s model ) .",
    "the distance to the lmc barycenter resulting from the application of the geometrical correction corresponding to position of the system is fully consistent with our previous result ( p13 , @xmath118 kpc ) . with future @xmath119 new eclipsing binaries to be analysed by our team",
    "we can provide very precise individual distance determinations to a total number of about 20 systems .",
    "such a large sample of systems , in tandem with an improved surface brightness - color relation our group is currently working on , will allow a significant improvement in the accuracy of the distance to the lmc , and thus of the zero point of the cosmic distance scale .",
