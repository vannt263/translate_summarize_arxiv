    "the recent inference of a planetary - mass gravitational companion to the star 51  pegasi ( hd 217014 ) from apparent radial velocity variation by mayor & queloz ( 1995 ) has subjected this otherwise unremarkable star to remarkable scrutiny . the mayor and queloz result was quickly verified by several groups with similar or higher - resolution spectroscopic techniques ( c.f .",
    "however , there has been no other evidence for a companion , e.g.  precision photometric monitoring has failed to show evidence for eclipses ( @xcite ) , and there is a significant lack of x - ray flux from the system compared to binary systems with similar periods ( @xcite ) .",
    "further , 51  peg s g5v spectral classification has become mildly controversial ( e.g.  @xcite , who argues for a g2 - 3v ) , as has its physical size ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "a planetary - mass companion in a 4.2 day orbit around a solar - mass 51  peg would have an orbital semi - major axis of approximately 0.05 au ( @xcite ) , slightly more if the companion were more massive . at a distance of 15.4 @xmath3 0.2 pc ( @xcite ) ,",
    "the approximate maximum primary - companion angular separation would be 3.5 millarcseconds ( mas ) .",
    "such an angular separation is well below resolution limits for current conventional imaging technology , but is accessible to optical and near - infrared interferometry . as only the lower mass limit",
    "is set by the spectroscopic results , it is possible the companion is significantly more massive  perhaps even a low - mass star .",
    "we have therefore studied 51  peg with the palomar testbed interferometer ( pti ) in an attempt to detect the putative companion if it is indeed sufficiently luminous .",
    "pti is a 110m - baseline interferometer operating at k - band ( 2  2.4 @xmath4 m ) located at palomar observatory , and described in detail elsewhere ( @xcite ) .",
    "the minimum pti fringe spacing is roughly 4 mas at the sky position of 51  peg , making a ( sufficiently ) luminous companion readily detectable .",
    "the observable used for these observations is the fringe contrast or _ visibility _ ( squared ) of an observed brightness distribution on the sky . in the limit that the putative 51  peg companion is dim ( or non - existent ) ,",
    "51  peg itself would appear as a single star , exhibiting visibility modulus ( and trivially , visibility squared ) given in a uniform disk model by : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the first - order bessel function , @xmath7 is the projected baseline vector magnitude at the star position , @xmath8 is the apparent angular diameter of the star , and @xmath9 is the center - band wavelength of the interferometric observation . however , if the putative 51  peg companion were in fact luminous enough to be detected by the interferometer , the expected squared visibility in a narrow bandpass would be given by : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the visibility moduli for 51  peg and the putative companion alone as given by eq .",
    "[ eq : v2_single ] , @xmath13 is the apparent brightness ratio between the 51  peg primary and companion , @xmath14 is the projected baseline vector at the 51  peg position , and @xmath15 is the primary - companion angular separation vector on the plane of the sky .",
    "the key to detecting a companion to 51  peg in pti data is to reliably determine the stability of the @xmath16 measured on 51  peg . without a luminous companion eq .",
    "[ eq : v2_single ] predicts a stable value of the @xmath16 observable on 51  peg ( with small variations due to baseline projection effects with varying hour angle on the source ) .",
    "conversely , in the presence of a luminous companion eq .",
    "[ eq : v2_double ] predicts sinusoidal excursions in @xmath16 as the system evolves and the earth rotates ; a three - magnitude fainter companion would produce roughly 20% peak - to - peak excursions in @xmath16 .",
    "a preliminary examination of data from 1996 suggested significant @xmath16 variations in 51  peg ( @xcite ) .",
    "the pti instrument configuration for the 1997 observations reported here incorporates compensation for spatially - varying instrument vibrations , as well as spatial filtering to improve the visibility measurements , both of which affected the 1996 data . in the analysis presented here we have placed an emphasis on choosing calibration sources and techniques that minimize potential instrumental or environmental effects ; namely we have required calibration observations that are in close spatial ( sky ) and temporal proximity to the 51  peg observations . due to a limiting k - magnitude of @xmath17 5 ( @xcite )",
    "this calibration strategy forces us to use slightly resolved calibration sources , making the absolute calibration of the @xmath16 difficult to determine . in the present work we have estimated the apparent diameter of the calibration objects with respect to a model diameter for 51  peg ( table [ tab : calibrators ] ) , and then assessed the @xmath16 stability of 51  peg and its calibrators by inter - comparison .",
    "such a strategy can say nothing about the actual apparent diameter of 51  peg ; we defer this question to a separate publication .",
    "the star 51  pegasi and at least one nearby calibration object were included in the pti observing program on 18 nights from july 19 through november 23 , 1997 . because we have noted significant systematic effects in measured visibilities over large sky separations , in this analysis",
    "we have limited our attention to 51  peg data calibrated by two nearby calibrators , hd 215510 and hd 211006 , with similar k - band brightness ( 3.96 ) as 51  peg ( @xcite ) .",
    "the relevant parameters of the calibration objects are summarized in table [ tab : calibrators ] .",
    "these calibration objects show no previous evidence of multiplicity or photometric variability , as well as no evidence of multiplicity in our data ( see below ) .",
    "both of these objects are resolved by our long baseline , hence the absolute calibration of our data depends on the calibrator diameters .",
    "apparent diameters for the calibration objects were estimated by single - star fits to @xmath16 sequences calibrating the calibration objects with respect to a single - star model 51  peg with model diameter of 0.72 @xmath3 0.06 mas implied by @xmath18 = 1.2 @xmath3 0.1 @xmath19 ( adopted by @xcite ) and 65.1 @xmath3 0.76 mas hipparcos parallax ( @xcite ) .",
    "the hypothesis fits themselves are discussed in ",
    "[ sec : single - star ] .",
    "this procedure is sufficient in a search for luminous companions to 51  peg , but leaves open the question of 51  peg s apparent diameter .",
    ".1997 pti 51  peg calibration objects considered in our analysis .",
    "the relevant parameters for our two calibration objects are summarized .",
    "the apparent diameter values are determined by a fit to our @xmath16 data calibrated with respect to a single - star model 51  peg using a model diameter of 0.72 @xmath3 0.06 mas ( @xcite , see table [ tab : fitsshypothesis ] ) .",
    "[ tab : calibrators ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we find no evidence to suggest that the putative 4.2-day period companion to 51  peg is detectable in our data ; all of the datasets we have analyzed indicate that 51  peg is at least as stable as our two calibration sources . the 1997 pti data on 51  peg is sufficiently stable that we can place significant limits on @xmath0k and consequently m@xmath1 of a 4.2-day period companion .",
    "we find upper limits in @xmath0k of 4.78 , 4.53 , and 4.27 for the 4.2-day period companion to 51  peg at 68% , 95% , and 99% confidence levels respectively .",
    "these @xmath0k limits imply companion m@xmath1 limits of 7.81 , 7.56 , and 7.30 , corresponding to upper limits on the mass of a putative main sequence companion at 0.17 , 0.20 , and 0.22 m@xmath2 at the 68% , 95% , and 99% confidence levels respectively ( @xcite ) .",
    "our results can not exclude the possibility of a very low - mass star in a face - on orbit as the 51  peg companion , but such a star would have to be of spectral type m5v or later ."
