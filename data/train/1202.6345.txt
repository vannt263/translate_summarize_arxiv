    "<S> these results show that obesity spreading behaves as a self - similar strongly - correlated critical system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , a note of caution has to be raised since , even if the highest prevalence of obesity is localized to the south and appalachia , the scaling analysis indicates that the obesity problem is the same ( self - similar ) across all usa , including the lower prevalence areas .    our results can not establish a causal relation between obesity prevalence and economic indicators : whether fluctuations in the food economy may impact obesity or , instead , whether the food industry reacts to obesity demands . </S>",
    "<S> however , the comparative similarities of statistical properties of demographic and economical variables serves to identify possible candidates which shape the epidemic . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the observation of a common universality class in the fluctuations of obesity prevalence and economic activity of supermarkets , food stores and food services which cluster in a different universality class than simple population dynamics is in line with studies proposing that an important component of the rise of obesity is linked to the obesogenic environment @xcite regulated by food market economies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this result is consistent with recent research that relates obesity with residential proximity to fast - food stores and restaurants @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the present analysis based on clustering and critical fluctuations is a supplement to studies of association between people s bmi and food s environment based on covariance @xcite ( methods section [ covariance ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have detected potential candidates in the economy which relate to the spreading of obesity by showing the same universal fluctuation properties . </S>",
