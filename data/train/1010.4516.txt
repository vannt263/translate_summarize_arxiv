    "boost invariance in a longitudinal beam direction is a key ingredient in theoretical descriptions of ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions . in 1983 , bjorken @xcite introduced a boost - invariant initial condition for landau s hydrodynamic model @xcite . because the hydrodynamic equations as well respect the boost symmetry , the following space - time evolution of the system is also boost - invariant , which leads to the central plateau in the particle rapidity distributions . owing to this symmetry ,",
    "the fluid evolution is described by the fluid proper time @xmath0 and the transverse coordinates @xmath1 and does not depend on the space - time rapidity @xmath2 , where the longitudinal beam direction is taken along the @xmath3 axis .    before the hydrodynamic evolution , the system of ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions is also assumed to hold the boost symmetry , because shortly after the collision , the nuclei are highly lorentz - contracted pancakes receding from the collision point at nearly the speed of light , so that there is no scale in the longitudinal direction .",
    "for example the flux - tube model ( the low  nussinov model @xcite ) , which assumes the generation of longitudinal color - electric fields just after high - energy particle collisions , comprehends the boost invariance .",
    "also in the framework of the color glass condensate , the formation of boost - invariant longitudinal electric fields and the longitudinal magnetic fields as well is predicted , of which the state is called glasma @xcite .",
    "such electric fields would depend on @xmath4 and @xmath5 but do not depend on the space - time rapidity @xmath6 .",
    "starting from the boost - invariant classical fields , how does the system evolve into a boost - invariant and locally thermalized quark - gluon plasma ?",
    "one possible approach to this problem is solving the classical yang ",
    "mills equations and investigating the dynamics of the classical electromagnetic fields @xcite . because of the expansion of the system , the electromagnetic fields decay in time . to understand the formation process of the quark - gluon plasma",
    ", however , the notion of particle or quantized fields is necessary . in particular , the classical yang ",
    "mills equations can not describe the quark production .",
    "if one introduces charged quantum fields interacting with the classical electric field into the system evolution , the system becomes unstable against particle production via the schwinger mechanism @xcite .",
    "the schwinger mechanism , nonperturbative particle pair creation from a classical field , has been studied as a mechanism of matter formation in heavy - ion collisions @xcite",
    ". however , the original schwinger mechanism treats spatially uniform electric fields .",
    "in contrast , electric fields expected to be generated in the early stage of heavy - ion collisions exist only between two nuclei receding from each other at a velocity close to the speed of light . in an ideal situation where the two nuclei run at exactly the speed of light , the electric fields span only inside the forward light cone .",
    "in the case of spatially homogeneous fields , the semiclassical tunneling description of pair creation implies that particles and antiparticles are created with vanishing longitudinal momentum .",
    "this has been assured by field - theoretical calculations @xcite .",
    "clearly , these particle - antiparticle pairs break the boost invariance of the background field by introducing one specific frame , namely their center of mass frame .",
    "how is this situation modified if an electric field exists only inside the light cone ?    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the schwinger mechanism under an electric field which localizes in the forward light cone , focusing on its real - time dynamics and the lorentz - boost invariance of the system . to get the real - time description , we introduce time - dependent particle definitions @xcite .",
    "the canonical quantization is done on an equal-@xmath4 line instead of an equal - time line in order to give a description preserving the boost invariance .",
    "the proper quantization procedure in the boost - invariant curvilinear coordinates @xcite provides a boost - invariant description of the pair creation . to concentrate on revealing the boost - invariant dynamics of the particle production",
    ", we treat the scalar qed under constant electric fields which is independent of @xmath6 and neglect the back - reaction of pair creation to the background field .",
    "we drop the dependence of the electric fields on @xmath4 and @xmath5 for simplicity . under the constant electric field",
    ", we can derive the analytic solution for the distribution of created particles .",
    "extension to the more general case , quark pair creation under a color - electric field and taking the back - reaction into account , is possible in a similar way as that in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "pair production in electric fields confined to a bounded region has been studied by martin and vautherin @xcite .",
    "they calculated the pair creation rate by using the balian - bloch expansion of green s functions and concluded that if the boundaries move with the speed of light , finite - size correlations vanish and the pair creation rate is the same as schwinger s original one . in their calculation ,",
    "information from outside the light cone is not used .",
    "however , it should be used as an initial condition on the forward light cone because inside and outside the light cone are causally connected .",
    "furthermore , calculating the pair creation rate is not sufficient to reveal the time evolution of the system @xcite . to properly describe the system evolution",
    ", we must set an initial condition and investigate the time evolution of the quantum fields . a study on this line",
    "has been carried out by cooper _",
    "_ @xcite . because the electric field is absent outside the forward light cone",
    ", there is no particle created .",
    "therefore , the initial state on the light cone should be a vacuum . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the initial vacuum is defined so that a charge current , which is regularized by the adiabatic regularization , vanishes at an initial time .",
    "however , in quantum field theory , there is an ambiguity in identifying a vacuum .",
    "requiring the absence of a particle or current at an initial time is not sufficient to determine one initial vacuum .",
    "because we work in the flat minkowski space , the vacuum must hold the poincar invariance , even if we use the curvilinear coordinates .",
    "hence , the vacuum we should employ for the particle mode defined in the @xmath4-@xmath6 coordinates must be the same as that associated with the usual quantization of free fields in the cartesian coordinates . in other words , because particles captured by detectors are considered as the particle modes associated with the usual plane wave expansion of the field operator in the cartesian coordinates , the state before the collision should be the vacuum for that particle mode .    because the configuration of the electric field is not symmetric under translation along the beam direction ( @xmath3 axis ) but symmetric under translation of the space - time rapidity @xmath6 , particles created from the electric field are eigenstates of the momentum conjugate to @xmath6 ( which will be denoted as @xmath7 in this paper ) , instead of the usual longitudinal momentum @xmath8 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the relation between these two kinds of momentum variables is given based on a coordinate transformation in classical mechanics , and the rapidity independence of particle spectra is shown .",
    "in contrast , we will derive a relation between the two eigenstates of these momenta as an operator relation in a field - theoretical sense and show that the eigenstate of the momentum conjugate to @xmath6 is a quantum - mechanical superposition of the eigenstate of the longitudinal momentum @xmath8 .",
    "this prescription enables us to study multiparticle correlations . because particles are created as a coherent superposition of several momentum modes , they are correlated in the momentum ( rapidity ) space .",
    "two - particle correlations between particles produced in the early stage of heavy - ion collisions @xcite attract interests in the context of the near - side ridge phenomena observed in heavy - ion collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite and recently in proton - proton collisions at the lhc @xcite .",
    "multiparticle correlations arising from the schwinger mechanism in spatially homogeneous electric fields have been studied by fukushima , gelis and lappi @xcite .",
    "we will investigate how that correlation is modified if an electric field spans only inside the forward light cone .",

    "[ sec : quantization ] , we review the field quantization in terms of the @xmath4-@xmath6 coordinates .",

    "the longitudinal correlation fades away as time goes on .",
    "this can be understood as follows : because particles which are created at the same time are strongly correlated , the correlation is long - range at first . as particle production continues to happen , many particles which are created at different times begin to coexist , so that the correlations are attenuated at later times .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : corr - a ] , the @xmath179 dependence of ( a ) the longitudinal correlations at fixed time @xmath180 and ( b ) the corresponding momentum distributions are shown .",
    "the two peak structures seen in the momentum distributions at early time are owing to some quantum effects and have been obtained in earlier works treating the pair creation of scalar particles @xcite .",
    "the rapidity - correlation length decreases with increasing @xmath181 .",
    "this is because the height of the momentum distributions depends on @xmath181 exponentially ( @xmath182 ) @xcite and their width scaled by @xmath183 is nearly independent of @xmath181 , so that the relative width of the momentum distributions increases with increasing @xmath181 .",
    "this @xmath181 dependence means that the heavier the transverse mass or the weaker the electric field , the shorter the rapidity correlation .    before closing this section ,",
    "let us note that although we have dealt with the constant electric field which is independent of @xmath4 , the formula is valid for electric fields having arbitrary @xmath4 dependence .",
    "thus , we can use eq .   even if the back - reaction of the particle production is taken into account , within the approximation that interaction between produced particles through quantum gauge fields is neglected .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the pair creation of scalar particles in electric fields which span only inside the forward light cone as a model for plasma formation in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "we have assumed the electric field is symmetric under the lorentz boost along the longitudinal beam direction and investigated how particle production happens maintaining the boost invariance of the field .    to give a description which holds the boost invariance ,",
    "we have developed the field quantization in terms of the curvilinear @xmath4-@xmath6 coordinates .",
    "this formalism may be useful for not only the study of pair creation but also for other studies that quantum fields in a boost - invariantly expanding system are involved .",
    "although we have treated scalar fields for simplicity , generalization to dirac fields or vector fields is straightforward .",
    "a detailed formulation of dirac fields in the @xmath4-@xmath6 coordinates has been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we have shown that under the boost - invariant field , particles are created as a coherent superposition of several eigenmodes of the longitudinal momentum . as a result ,",
    "the rapidity distribution of the particles is independent of rapidity , and the particles have the scaling velocity distribution @xmath184 from the first instance they are created .",
    "a significant point is that this flow of particles consists of quantum - mechanical states .",
    "each particle spreads in the forward light cone and forms the scaling velocity distribution as a quantum state .",
    "it is not the case that a cluster of classical particles forms this flow like in the bjorken flow in classical hydrodynamics .",
    "this fact brings nontrivial rapidity correlations among the particles .",
    "we have calculated the two - particle correlations between particles created from the boost - invariant field , and found that the correlation is short - range with respect to the transverse momentum , which originates in the bose ",
    "einstein correlation , and is long - range with respect to the longitudinal rapidity .",
    "these features may remind us of the near - side ridge phenomena observed in nucleus - nucleus collisions at the rhic @xcite and recently in proton - proton collisions at the lhc @xcite . however , to make quantitative predictions , further improvements of this study , such as introducing a proper - time dependence of the electric field due to expansion of the system and taking the back reaction of the pair creation into account , are necessary .",
    "the back reaction can be introduced by the maxwell equation @xmath185 where @xmath186 denotes the charge current operator of the produced particles . in our calculation , the longitudinal correlation fades away as proper time goes on , because under the constant field the particle production continues to happen and many particles which are created at different times coexist at later times .",
    "hence , we can conclude that the life time of the electric field should be short to obtain a long - range rapidity correlation .",
    "furthermore , considering a tubelike structure of the electric field and effects of radial flow may be important for the transverse correlation @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to study whether the correlation can survive under a thermalization process , which is not included in our treatment , or under the subsequent hydrodynamic evolution .",
