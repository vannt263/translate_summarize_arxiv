    "pressure - balanced magnetic structures in the form of strong magnetic enhancements ( humps ) and depressions ( holes ) that are quasi - stationary in the plasma frame , with no or little change in the magnetic field direction , are commonly observed in regions of the solar wind and of planetary magnetosheaths with relatively large @xmath0 and a dominant ( generally ion ) temperature in the transverse direction ( see , for instance , @xcite and references therein ) . the origin of these structures is still not fully understood , but they are usually viewed as nonlinearly saturated states of the mirror instability ( mi ) discovered by vedenov and sagdeev @xcite .",
