    "since the discovery of the correlation between the stellar bulge mass in galaxies and the mass of their supermassive black holes @xcite , it is now widely acknowledged that these central supermassive black holes play an important role in governing the formation and evolution of their host galaxies . in our current picture of galaxy formation , galaxies and their supermassive black - holes co - evolve .",
    "molecular gas and the dusty interstellar medium ( ism ) in galaxies , acts as the fuel for both star formation and black hole accretion .",
    "therefore , studying the distribution of dust and gas in star forming galaxies with actively accreting supermassive black holes can help shed light on the exact physical processes that are driving co evolution .    both star formation and black hole accretion activity in the universe peak at @xmath17 ( e.g. @xcite ) and this represents the key epoch in the universe s history at which to study the feeding and feedback processes in galaxies and quasars that are the main drivers of co - evolution . over the last two decades , surveys starting with the scuba bolometer on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) and , more recently",
    ", using the _ herschel _ space satellite , have led to the discovery of large populations of far infrared ( fir ) and submillimetre bright starburst galaxies ( smgs ) at the main epoch of galaxy formation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "molecular gas detections are now being assembled for many tens to hundreds of such galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "several studies of molecular gas in @xmath18 galaxies have also taken advantage of gravitational lensing to amplify the molecular line signal ( e.g. @xcite ) . while clearly an advantage for probing intrinsically fainter galaxies , differential magnification between the different dust and gas components can make interpretations regarding their actual spatial distribution complicated in such lensed systems .",
    "quasars , on account of being among the brightest extragalactic sources in our universe , were some of the first sources to be observed in molecular gas ( e.g. @xcite ) . using the compilations of extragalactic sources with co detections in @xcite and @xcite , we find there are a total of 89 quasars that have been detected in co all the way from the local universe out to the highest redshifts of @xmath19 .",
    "many of the recent efforts have focussed on @xmath20 quasars ( e.g. @xcite ) and , as a consequence , the numbers of quasars with co detections at the peak epoch of galaxy formation ( 1.5@xmath21 ) is considerably smaller - @xmath2220 quasars .",
    "many of the quasars that have been observed in molecular gas at these epochs are gravitationally lensed systems ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "excluding these lensed systems and focussing only on unlensed quasars where spatially mapping the gas and dust distributions is considerably easier , there are only 13 quasars at @xmath23 with co detections @xcite . detecting molecular gas in even a small number of unlensed quasars at these redshifts , to synchronously study the fuelling of star formation and black hole accretion at the epoch when both are at their peak , is therefore valuable .",
    "most searches for molecular gas in quasars have started from samples of ultraviolet ( uv ) luminous quasars ( e.g. @xcite ) that were already known to be fir / millimetre bright @xcite .",
    "the studies by @xcite and @xcite find that only 9 out of 53 uv luminous quasars at @xmath24 ( i.e. 17 per cent ) are detected at 850@xmath25 m down to 3@xmath26 flux density limits of @xmath107 - 9 mjy and 9 out of 26 uv luminous quasars at @xmath24 ( i.e. 35 per cent ) are detected at 1.2 mm down to 3@xmath26 flux density limits of @xmath101.8 - 4 mjy . in the galaxy formation scenario first advocated by @xcite and",
    "now commonly adopted in galaxy formation models ( e.g. @xcite ) , the most highly star forming galaxies at high redshift e.g. the smgs , will eventually evolve into uv luminous quasars .",
    "the relatively small fraction of fir / mm - bright quasars argues for a quick transition between the two populations and recent studies suggest that the transition phase could be as short lived as @xmath101 myr @xcite . in such a picture of galaxy formation , transition populations of hybrid smg - quasars should exist and a larger fraction of these transition quasars should be fir bright , gas rich systems compared to the uv luminous quasars . molecular gas observations of smgs and uv luminous quasars have also revealed some differences between the two populations .",
    "while smgs appear to have substantial amounts of low excitation gas @xcite , this does not seem to be the case in quasars @xcite which could therefore represent a later evolutionary stage when the extended gas reservoirs in the galaxy have been significantly depleted . once again , if transition objects between these two populations do exist , their gas fractions might be expected to be intermediate between the smgs and uv luminous quasars .",
    "searches for these so called  transition \" galaxies have often focussed on obscured agn populations with different selection methods picking out agn and quasars with a wide variety of dust extinctions and luminosities ( e.g. @xcite ) . while in principle , any or all of these populations could represent the missing evolutionary link between star forming galaxies and optical quasars , in practice further multiwavelength observations are necessary to establish that these obscured quasars are indeed distinct in terms of their physical properties from matched control samples of unobscured quasars .",
    "our searches for obscured quasars have been focussed at the highest luminosities and at the peak epoch of galaxy formation at @xmath27 with colour cuts deliberately chosen to isolate high luminosity quasars with the same levels of dust extinction as seen in smgs at similar redshifts . to date",

    "three of the four quasars selected for alma observations - ulasj0123 + 1525 , ulasj1234 + 0907 and ulasj2315 + 0143 - correspond to three of the reddest quasars in our sample with inferred dust extinctions towards the quasar continuum of a@xmath39=4.0 , 6.0 and 3.4 mags respectively .",
    "assuming the extinction is connected to star formation in the quasar host galaxy as discussed extensively in b12 and b15 , these broad line quasars would be the best candidates for highly star forming gas rich hosts .",

    "the largest surveys for cold dust in high luminosity quasars at @xmath17 , are still those conducted using the scuba bolometer ( at 850@xmath25 m ) on the james clerk maxwell telescope and using the mambo bolometer ( at 1200@xmath25 m ) on the iram 30-m telescope ( e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "we can also compare the submillimetre and millimetre flux densities for our reddened quasars with the stacked results from the scuba surveys , which suggest that the average 850@xmath25 m flux density of a flux limited sample of blue quasars is 1.9@xmath550.4 mjy at @xmath24 @xcite and 2.0@xmath550.6 mjy at @xmath64 @xcite . based on our alma detections ,",
    "our reddened quasars would all have 850@xmath25 m fluxes that are higher than these average properties for the blue quasars as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : z_850 ] . the larger 850@xmath25 m fluxes could suggest that luminous reddened quasars have higher dust luminosities and are therefore , on average , more likely to be hosted in starburst galaxies relative to their unobscured blue counterparts .",
    "however , larger samples of reddened quasars with cold dust continuum measurements and better constraints on their dust sed are clearly required before any robust conclusions can be drawn .",
    "we also compare the submillimetre fluxes of our reddened quasars to those of x - ray selected agn .",
    "x - ray surveys of high redshift agn have generally covered smaller areas on the sky compared to optical surveys and therefore probe quasars and agn at lower luminosities . considering only the most x - ray luminous , high redshift quasars in the cosmos field with scuba-2 850@xmath25 m observations from the scuba-2 cosmology legacy survey , the stacked 850@xmath25 m fluxes are 0.7@xmath550.2 mjy for type 1 agn and 1.3@xmath550.3 mjy for type 2 agn @xcite , once again lower than those measured for the reddened quasars in this work .",
    "there are however a number of x - ray agn that are individually detected at 850@xmath25 m in @xcite with 850@xmath25 m flux densities of @xmath104 - 10 mjy , comparable with the inferred submillimetre fluxes of our reddened quasars .",
    "previous scuba surveys of x - ray absorbed and x - ray unabsorbed quasars have suggested a link between cold dust emission and x - ray obscuration @xcite and we note that for those reddened quasars where we have x - ray spectra ( e.g. @xcite ) , moderate column densities of @xmath1010@xmath65 @xmath66 are present .",
    "surveys for molecular gas in blue quasars have focussed on the subset of the population that are ( sub)millimetre loud , in contrast to our  blind \" search for co in the reddened quasar population .",
    "so far six of our near infrared selected , heavily reddened quasars from the b12 and b15 samples have been observed in co - four in this paper and one each in @xcite and @xcite . despite not being selected a - priori to be fir / mm bright ,",
    "all six quasars have been detected in co. as stated earlier , most optical quasars that have been observed in co were known a - priori to be fir luminous therefore increasing the probability of a co detection . @xcite",
    "have looked for co in a sample of 10 quasars of comparable redshift to our reddened quasar sample .",
    "three quasars in their sample were detected in blank field submm surveys over much smaller areas of sky than the wide - field near infrared surveys that have been used to select our reddened quasars ( b12,b15 ) , and are therefore lower luminosity .",
    "the remaining seven quasars in the @xcite sample , are brighter than the @xmath67-band flux limit imposed on our reddened quasar searches in b12 and b15 and can therefore be directly compared to our sample . from these seven fir bright optical quasars , five",
    "have been detected in co with the limits on the co line luminosity for the remaining two placing them below the co line luminosities of all six of our reddened quasars .",
    "presumably , starting from a complete sample of unobscured quasars ( i.e. not just those known a - priori to be millimetre bright ) would result in a smaller fraction being detected in co. the black hole masses of our reddened quasars and the uv - luminous @xcite quasars are comparable given the typical uncertainties in these black hole mass estimates .",
    "hence , the co - detection fraction in our sample suggests that a larger fraction of luminous reddened quasars have significant molecular gas reservoirs compared to uv luminous blue quasars of comparable luminosity and mass .    in b15 we demonstrated that our reddened quasars outnumber blue quasars at the highest luminosities whereas the reddened quasar population is subdominant as we approach more typical luminosities around l@xmath68 .",
    "one interpretation of these trends put forward in b15 is that the most luminous , massive black holes have a longer duty cycle associated with their assembly or growth phase and therefore are seen as dust obscured for a longer period of time .",
    "as all our alma targets are drawn from the high luminosity , massive end of the reddened quasar population , the detection of significant amounts of cold dust and molecular gas in these systems fits in with this overall picture .",
    "in such an evolutionary sequence , ( sub)millimetre - loud blue quasars are presumably a later , more evolved phase when significant gas reservoirs and star formation are still detectable but some of the dust has been cleared out .",
    "the ( sub)millimetre - faint blue quasars may then correspond to an even more advanced phase when significant star formation has ceased either because the gas supply has been depleted , or as a result of agn feedback .      under the premise that dust reddened quasars are a phase in massive galaxy evolution preceding the unobscured quasar phase , and that this phase is associated with high levels of star formation and high rates of accretion onto the supermassive black hole , we would predict that populations of high luminosity agn that are even more obscured than our reddened quasars may have similar or higher levels of star formation in their host galaxies .",
    "these most highly obscured agn might therefore be expected to be characterised by high 850@xmath25 m fluxes .",
    "the most suitable sample of mid - infrared luminous , heavily obscured agn with comparable agn luminosities and redshifts as our reddened quasars are the so called agn dominated hot dust obscured galaxies or hotdogs that have emerged from the _ wise _ all sky survey ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we use as the basis for comparison , the scuba-2 850@xmath25 m and alma 870@xmath25 m flux densities of the spectroscopically confirmed _ wise _ hotdogs at @xmath69 from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these studies provide a sample of 42 hotdogs with secure spectroscopic redshifts overlapping the redshift range of both our reddened quasar sample and the @xcite optical quasars .",
    "once again we extrapolate our reddened quasar 3 mm flux densities using the sed assumptions above to predict their 850@xmath25 m fluxes .",
    "a comparison of the 850@xmath25 m flux densities can be seen in fig .",

    "if we consider the fraction detected to the scuba limits of @xmath107 mjy , the number drops to only 3 - i.e. just 7 per cent of the population . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : z_850 ] , in many cases the limits on the submillimetre fluxes obtained for the _ wise _ hotdogs , place them well below the flux densities of our reddened quasars .",
    "thus , as concluded in @xcite and several other recent _ wise _ papers , these hotdogs on average do not show evidence for the dust luminosities being dominated by cold dust heated by star formation and instead , it is likely that most of the dust heating in these galaxies comes from the agn .",
    "the _ wise _ hotdogs therefore do not seem to fit our simple evolutionary picture linking obscured and unobscured quasars . as suggested in @xcite",
    ", these _ wise _ agn could perhaps represent a class of objects where the peak of agn activity precedes that of star formation .",
    "alternatively , the higher line - of - sight extinction seen in these sources could simply reflect a difference in viewing angle between these _ wise _ agn and both the reddened and unobscured broad line quasar populations .",
    "there have been relatively few studies of co molecular gas in the _ wise _ population so far but @xcite have looked for @xmath4co(3 - 2 ) and @xmath4co(4 - 3 ) in two of these galaxies .",
    "neither source is detected in their observations but the limits on the gas mass from that study are consistent with the low end of the gas masses we have derived for the reddened quasar population in this paper .",

    "having detected both cold dust and molecular gas in dust reddened quasars , we can attempt to compare the star formation efficiencies and gas depletion timescales to those measured in high redshift starburst galaxies and quasars .",

    "while these compilations are not necessarily exhaustive and complete , they can be taken to be representative of current observational samples . throughout this analysis we work with the full sample of six heavily reddened quasars with",

    "[ fig : lir_lco ] is large .",
    "we caution also that the infrared luminosities in the literature have been calculated using heterogenous methods both in terms of the wavelength range used to compute these luminosities and the assumptions made regarding the form of the dust sed .",
    "to gain further insight into the similarities and differences in the star formation efficiencies between smgs , quasars and reddened quasars , we now compare both the fir luminosity distributions and co luminosity distributions over the same redshift range , using a ks - test to determine the probability that they are drawn from the same parent population .",
    "there is no evidence for a difference in the fir luminosity distributions of the three samples when the same assumptions are made regarding the dust temperature and emissivity index of the fir sed .",
    "comparing the l@xmath72 luminosities for the three samples however , we find that quasars and smgs have a 3 per cent probability of being drawn from the same distribution , highlighting that the molecular gas reservoirs may indeed be different in the two samples . reddened quasars on the other hand have a 32 per cent probability of having co luminosities drawn from the same luminosity distribution as smgs and a 54 per cent probability of being drawn from the same luminosity distribution as optical quasars so their gas properties are consistent with both smgs and optical quasars .",

    "however , we have seen that the co emission is already resolved in one of our reddened quasars - ulasj2315@xmath140143 ( section [ sec:2315 ] ) - with an implied source diameter of @xmath7420 kpc .",
    "there are hints also that the gas emission is marginally resolved in ulasj1234 + 0907 and vhsj2101@xmath605943 .",
    "we used casa to fit a 2-d gaussian ( in ra , dec ) to the co maps constructed by summing all the channels covering the full extent of the line .",
    "the deconvolved source sizes along the major axis are ( 2.53@xmath550.52 ) arcsec @xmath75(20@xmath554 kpc ) and ( 1.34@xmath550.29 ) arcsec @xmath75(11@xmath552 ) kpc for ulasj1234 + 0907 and vhsj2101@xmath605943 respectively .",
    "we note that the images used for the size estimates were generated using _",
    "natural _ weighting , which results in strong sidelobes in the image plane .",
    "we have therefore checked that the sizes quoted here are consistent within the error bars with the deconvolved sizes estimated from images generated using a _ briggs _ weighting ( robust=0.5 ) , where the effects of the sidelobes should be minimised . finally , for our most extended and highest s / n source , ulasj2315@xmath140143 , we have also checked that the major axis derived from directly fitting to the visibility data using the casa task _ uvmodelfit _ , is once again consistent with the deconvolved sizes from the image plane quoted here .",
    "the large implied sizes for the warm gas reservoirs in these quasars , while still highly uncertain , are nevertheless at odds with previous observations of gas in quasar host galaxies . in the few cases where the gas emission has been resolved in high redshift quasar host galaxies ,",
    "it is distributed in compact regions of @xmath22 few kpc in size ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the conventional interpretation is that the molecular gas in quasar hosts resides in a nuclear region close to the accreting black hole , and its excitation properties can therefore be explained by a single temperature and density gas component .",
    "smgs on the other hand often show evidence for substantially larger reservoirs of low excitation gas @xmath810 kpc in size ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "although the excitation properties of the gas in reddened quasars remains to be determined , we tentatively conclude that the co sizes appear to more closely resemble smgs rather than high redshift quasar hosts .      with the co detections providing us with molecular gas masses and the co velocity widths providing a crude estimate of the dynamical masses , we can estimate the molecular gas fractions and compare directly to gas fractions in both smgs and optical quasars . a ks - test comparing the observed fwhm of the co lines in smgs , optical quasars and reddened quasars reveals no evidence for a difference in the distributions between the three populations .",
    "if the three populations indeed form an evolutionary sequence with the optical quasars representing more evolved systems and smgs representing the earlier gas rich stages of massive galaxy formation , we would expect the reddened quasars to have gas fractions that are intermediate between smgs and optical quasars . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fwhm_lco ] we show the fwhm of the co line - a proxy for the dynamical mass - versus the co(1 - 0 ) luminosities - a proxy for gas mass .",
    "we compare our sample to optical quasars from @xcite and @xcite and to the smgs from @xcite , selecting quasars and smgs that are unlensed only .",
    "we also show the scaling relation between these two quantities derived for unlensed sources by @xcite , as well as a simple relation that equates the gas mass to the dynamical mass as follows :    @xmath76    where the constant , @xmath77 depends on the geometry and inclination of the source , @xmath26 represents the line dispersion @xmath10fwhm/2.35 for a gaussian line , @xmath78 is the source size and @xmath79 is the gravitational constant .",
    "we consider two separate cases : ( i ) @xmath80 , @xmath81 kpc , @xmath82=4.6 m@xmath3 ( k km s@xmath9 pc@xmath83)@xmath9 , which is appropriate for disk galaxies and ( ii ) @xmath84 , @xmath85 kpc , @xmath82=1 m@xmath3 ( k km s@xmath9 pc@xmath83)@xmath9 , representing a virialised , spherical source .     for both disk like and spherical geometries . ]",
    "we find that the reddened quasars occupy a region roughly between the majority of the optical quasars and the smgs in fig .",
    "[ fig : fwhm_lco ] .",
    "however , the observed fwhm is also sensitive to inclination with thin rotating disks viewed face - on having narrower fwhm . @xcite",
    "have argued based on the fact that smgs show a correlation between co linewidth and line luminosity , that they are primarily thick disks / turbulent ellipsoids where the fwhm is not as dependent on inclination .",
    "however , optical quasars , where broad emission lines can be seen in the quasar spectra , may have an inclination bias relative to smgs although the opening angles needed for detection of broad lines in quasars likely span a large range . if the molecular gas sits in a thin disk in these quasars , the optical quasars with very narrow fwhm that sit above the various lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : fwhm_lco ] , could be seen more face - on . on the other hand , if the gas morphologies are more turbulent and inhomogenous - e.g. as would be expected for merging systems - the fwhm is unlikely to be as dependent on inclination .",
    "further observations are required to established whether the reddened quasars have any inclination bias relative to optical quasars and smgs .",
    "we note that there is a general trend among our objects for the more highly obscured quasars to have larger observed co fwhm - e.g. ulasj1234 + 0907 , the dustiest quasar in our sample ( a@xmath86 mag ; b12 ) has the broadest co line whereas vhsj2101@xmath605943 , the least dusty quasar observed ( a@xmath87 mag ; b15 ) , has the narrowest co line , suggesting that some of the reddening in these quasars could be linked to orientation .",
    "however , in section [ sec:2315 ] we have seen that in at least one of our quasars the gas appears to be distributed in a disk at an inclination angle of 57@xmath53 .",
    "this is consistent with the inclination angles inferred for smgs .",
    "if smgs , reddened quasars and optical quasars have similar source sizes and inclinations on average , for a fixed dynamical mass or co fwhm , reddened quasars have gas masses that are intermediate between smgs and optical quasars , and are therefore on their way to exhausting their gas supply and evolving into optical quasars .",
    "further spatially resolved observations of the reddened quasars to get rotational dynamical parameters as well as internal velocity dispersions , is clearly the next step forward in order to get robust gas fractions in these sources .",
    "we have presented alma band 3 observations of a sample of four heavily reddened ( a@xmath88 mag ) , high luminosity broad line quasars at @xmath1 selected from wide field near infrared surveys . the aim of these observations is to test whether such reddened quasars could represent the evolutionary link between starburst galaxies and unobscured , optically bright quasars at high redshifts .",
    "all four quasars are detected in both the dust continuum ( at observed frame wavelengths of @xmath103 mm ) and in the @xmath4co(3 - 2 ) line .",
    "we infer star formation rates , dust and gas masses from these observations and attempt to place these measurements in context with corresponding values for other high redshift galaxy populations :    * the dust masses range from 2.5@xmath510@xmath6m@xmath3 to 1.2@xmath510@xmath31m@xmath3 .",
    "the fir luminosities are @xmath810@xmath89l@xmath3 and the implied star formation rates in the quasar host galaxies is @xmath90 m@xmath3 yr@xmath9 , suggesting that these reddened quasars reside in prodigiously star forming host galaxies with very high dust luminosities .",

    "these gas masses are in the range @xmath9410@xmath32m@xmath3 and the gas - to - dust ratios are in the range @xmath1030 - 110 . * instead , adopting a gas - to - dust ratio of 91 , as found in nearby galaxies , dust- and co - based gas masses agree within a factor of @xmath102 for three of the quasars . for ulasj2315 + 0143",
    ", the dust - based gas mass is @xmath103 times larger .",
    "the co- and dust - based masses could be made consistent for ulasj2315 + 0143 if a co - to - h@xmath92 conversion factor of @xmath95 ( k km s@xmath9 pc@xmath83 ) applies .",
    "such a value is intermediate between that found in nearby galaxies / high - redshift star - forming disks and in nuclear starbursts / quasar host galaxies . *",
    "the co linewidths span @xmath96 kms@xmath9 , comparable to linewidths in other high - redshift smgs and quasars . using several different estimators , dynamical masses of m@xmath59sin@xmath83(i ) @xmath103@xmath510@xmath32m@xmath3 to @xmath103@xmath510@xmath61m@xmath3 are found .",
    "* ulasj2315 + 0143 ( @xmath97 ) shows evidence for spatially resolved co emission over @xmath1020 kpc , with a strong velocity gradient across the source .",
    "we demonstrate that the velocity field is consistent with the presence of a large , rotating gas disk although other scenarios such as mergers can not be ruled out at the resolution of the current data .",
    "ulasj2315@xmath140143 is the quasar with the largest discrepancy between its dust and co based gas masses , and where there is evidence for @xmath98 ( k km s@xmath9 pc@xmath83)@xmath9 . *",
    "the sizes of the @xmath4co(3 - 2 ) emitting regions appear to be large ( @xmath8 10 kpc ) hinting at the presence of extended reservoirs of warm gas .",
    "gas emission in high - redshift , unobscured quasars is generally compact ( @xmath22few kpc ) . if extended emission is confirmed via higher resolution observations , the reddened quasars would instead be more similar to the properties of smgs .",
    "* ulasj1234 + 0907 ( @xmath16 ) has two other millimetre bright galaxies at the same redshift in the field - of - view , with implied gas masses of a few times 10@xmath32m@xmath3 .",
    "the two galaxies are located @xmath1090 kpc and @xmath10170 kpc from the quasar .",
    "ulasj1234 + 0907 may reside in a significant over - density at @xmath1 . *",
    "a similar fraction of reddened quasars are  submillimetre loud \" compared to unobscured uv luminous quasars .",
    "however the average dust luminosities of reddened quasars would appear to be higher than for the uv luminous quasar population at similar redshifts .",
    "reddened quasars also appear to have higher cold dust luminosities compared to the recently discovered population of hot dust obscured galaxies from _",
    "wise_. so far , 100 per cent of our reddened quasars ( 6/6 ) have been observed to have very large molecular gas reservoirs .",
    "a direct comparison to the unobscured quasar population is not possible as surveys of molecular gas in uv luminous quasars have focussed on the subset of these that were already known to be millimetre bright , therefore increasing the probability of detecting molecular gas .",
    "nevertheless , several uv luminous , millimetre bright quasars with comparable black hole masses and agn luminosities to our sample , have limits on their molecular gas masses that place them below the gas masses seen so far in the reddened quasar population , indicating that these unobscured quasars could indeed correspond to a later evolutionary phase .",
    "further observations of molecular gas in larger samples of both reddened and unobscured quasars matched in luminosity and black hole mass would help confirm this trend .",
    "* using the co linewidths in our sample as a proxy for the dynamical mass , and the co line luminosities as a proxy for gas mass , we find that the reddened quasars have molecular gas fractions that are intermediate between smgs and optical quasars assuming that all three populations have similar source sizes and inclinations",
    ". it therefore seems plausible that reddened quasars are being seen as they are transitioning to optical quasars from starburst galaxies .",
    "their supermassive black holes already appear to be fully assembled and , given the rate of ongoing star formation , they will very quickly exhaust their gas reservoirs and presumably blow out the surrounding gas and dust on their way to evolving into some of the most luminous , unobscured quasars - progenitors of the largest supermassive black holes seen in the universe today .",
    "overall , our observations demonstrate the high scientific return possible from alma observations of luminous quasars at the main epoch of galaxy formation .",
    "studies of the host galaxy properties of intrinsically luminous , unlensed quasars at @xmath17 are still scarce and further observations with alma both in terms of assembling larger samples of such sources and obtaining higher spatial resolution detections , will help shed light on the exact nature of the host galaxies of the largest supermassive black holes , seen as they are being assembled in the high redshift universe .",
