    "cosmological distance formulae are standard formulae for different world models in use for more than half a century and are available in review articles and text books on cosmology .",
    "the two most commonly used formulae for cosmological distant sources are the luminosity distance formula and the angular diameter distance formula .",
    "a use of either of these in conjunction with the measured values of flux densities or angular sizes of a suitable sample , for ascertaining the geometry of the universe , depends upon the assumption of the existence of a standard candle / rod , and a successful interpretation is very much dependent on the cosmological evolution of the intrinsic luminosities / physical sizes of the parent population of the sources of interest .",
    "not only the large spread in their intrinsic values makes it very uncertain to define a standard candle / rod , in fact in most cases the effects of the evolutionary changes in source properties are overwhelmingly larger than those expected due to differences in geometry between different world models .",
    "the other two formulae , which presently are being used only for nearby objects , are the proper motion distance formula and the parallax distance formula .    for testing different world models , application of the parallax distance in particular , unlike other distance measures ,",
    "does not depend upon any assumption about the intrinsic properties of the observed sources .",
    "thus it is also independent of the chosen frequency band since no source property is involved , as long as the source is detectable in that band . at a given redshift",
    ", the observed parallax depends only on the chosen baseline of the observer and the world  model geometry .",
    "weinberg ( 1970 ) showed that even otherwise , the measurement of redshift and luminosity ( or angular diameter ) distance can not in principle determine the sign and magnitude of the spatial curvature unless supplemented with a dynamical model .",
    "however , this ambiguity can be resolved by parallax measurements at cosmological distances . with the achieved angular resolutions already in the micro - arcsec domain ( fomalont & kobayashi 2006 ) ,",
    "it could with the advancement of technology become important rather sooner than expected .",
    "the cosmological parallax  distance formulation is available in text - books on cosmology ( weinberg 1972 ; peacock 1999 ) , review articles ( von hoerner 1974 ) or reference books ( lang 1980 ) , with expressions for the different world models given there .",
    "here we show that a subtle correction is required in the standard formulation found in the contemporary literature .",
    "the correction stems from the fact that the physical dimensions of a gravitationally bound system like that of the solar system ( or for that matter even of larger systems like that of a galaxy ) , do not change with the cosmological expansion of the universe .",
    "therefore two ends of a baseline , used by the observer for parallax measurements , do not partake in the free - fall - like motion of the cosmic fluid and thus can not be considered to form a set of co - moving co - ordinates , contrary to what seems to have been implicitly assumed in the standard text - book derivations of the parallax distance formula .",
    "the correction can be very large ( a factor of three or even more ) at large redshifts . in any case , irrespective of the amount of corrections involved , it is imperative to have formulae bereft of any shortcomings . in the next section",
    "we shall briefly review the formulation given in the literature and in the section following that , we spell out the required corrections .",
    "in a homogeneous and isotropic universe , the line element can be expressed in the robertson - walker metric form , @xmath1\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 , a function of time @xmath3 , is known as the cosmic scale factor , @xmath4 is the curvature index that can take one of the three possible values @xmath5 or @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the time - independent co - moving co - ordinates .    from einstein s field equations",
    ", one can relate the curvature index @xmath4 and the present values of the cosmic scale factor @xmath8 to the hubble constant @xmath9 , the matter energy density @xmath10 and the vacuum energy ( dark energy ) density @xmath11 as ( peacock 1999 ) , @xmath12 the space is flat ( @xmath13 ) if @xmath14 .    as shown by weinberg ( 1972 )",
    ", an observer using a baseline @xmath15 to make measurements of a source at radial co - ordinate @xmath16 will infer a parallax angle , @xmath17 defining a parallax distance , as in euclidean geometry , by @xmath18 we can write , @xmath19 in general it is not possible to express @xmath20 in terms of the cosmological redshift @xmath21 of the source in a close - form analytical expression and one may have to evaluate it numerically .",
    "for example , in the @xmath22 world - models , @xmath16 is given by , @xmath23 and since @xmath13 , one can write , @xmath24 for a given @xmath11 , one can evaluate @xmath20 from ( 5 ) by a numerical integration .",
    "however for @xmath25 cosmologies , where the deceleration parameter @xmath26 , it is possible to express @xmath16 in an analytical form ( mattig 1959 ) , @xmath27 also equation ( 1 ) now becomes , @xmath28 then it is straight forward to get , @xmath29^{1/2}}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is the expression derived by weinberg ( 1972 ) , quoted in lang ( 1980 ) and also used by von hoerner ( 1974 ) .",
    "one can get rid of the square - root in the denominator ( peacock 1999 ) to write equation ( 8) in an alternative form , @xmath30",
    "in the derivation of the expression for the parallax angle ( weinberg 1972 ) , while tracing the light path from the source to the observer , the baseline ends were defined by co - moving co - ordinates .",
    "but the two ends of any rod or baseline , be it the sun - earth line or some larger baseline in the solar system ( or still larger ones but as long as one is confined within a gravitationally bound system like our galaxy ) , can not be freely falling with the expanding cosmic fluid as the distance between the two ends of the rod is taken to be fixed .",
    "one can consider one end of the baseline to be at rest with respect to the underlying cosmic fluid , but then the other end , at a fixed proper distance @xmath15 , will have a velocity @xmath31 with respect to the underlying co - moving sub - stratum .",
    "that means the second end of the baseline , because of its motion with respect to the co - moving sub - stratum , will have an aberration , @xmath32 .",
    "this will add to the value of the parallax angle as given by ( 2 ) and the actually measured parallax angle will be , @xmath33\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then for the parallax distance , defined by @xmath34 , we can write , @xmath35 in the @xmath25 cosmologies , the modified formula for parallax distance now becomes , @xmath36 } { \\left[\\left(q_0 - 2\\right)\\left(q_0 - 1-q_0z\\right)+\\left(3q_0 - 2\\right)\\sqrt{1 + 2q_0z}\\right]}\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] actually the relations ( 6 ) , ( 8) , ( 9 ) and ( 12 ) are clumsy when to be used for small @xmath37 and @xmath21 as then one has to evaluate these expressions in the limit .",
    "terrell ( 1977 ) provided a much simpler form for @xmath16 as an alternative to mattig s expression , @xmath38 } { \\left[1+q_0z+\\sqrt{1 + 2q_0z}\\right]}\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using equation ( 3 ) and ( 13 ) , after some algebraic manipulations we get @xmath20 as , @xmath39 } { \\left[(1+z+z^2+q_0z - q_0z^2)+(1+z)\\sqrt{1 + 2q_0z}\\right]}\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] similarly one gets a much simpler form for @xmath40 also , @xmath41 } { \\left[(1 + 2z+2z^2+q_0z - q_0z^2)+(1 + 2z)\\sqrt{1 + 2q_0z}\\right]}\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the expressions ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) are much simpler to use , especially when evaluating @xmath40 for small @xmath37 or @xmath21 values as one can avoid going through the process of taking a limit .",
    "as both the parallax and the correction for the parallax angle are proportional to the baseline @xmath15 , the relative correction to the parallax distance is independent of the length of the baseline and could become appreciable at large redshifts .",
    "figure ( 1 ) shows a plot of the text - book expression @xmath20 as well as the corrected expression @xmath40 , for different world models ( @xmath42 ) in the @xmath25 cosmologies .",
    "we see that at large redshifts the corrected values for the parallax distance are at least a factor of two or three lower .",
    "also the parallax distance does not seem to increase indefinitely with redshift . from the expressions ( 14 ) for @xmath20",
    "we find that as @xmath43 , @xmath20 reduces to @xmath44 $ ] while @xmath40 from equation ( 15 ) reduces to @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "thus the corrected parallax distance values are smaller by a factor @xmath46 at large redshifts , which for @xmath47 case ( milne s world model ) is a reduction factor of 2 and in the flat space ( @xmath48 ) it is a factor of 3 , the factor is still larger for positive curvature spaces with @xmath49 .",
    "recent observations indicate that @xmath50 and the space may be flat with @xmath13 .",
    "in such a case , @xmath40 has to be evaluated numerically from , @xmath51 where @xmath52 figure ( 2 ) shows a plot of parallax distance with redshift for the flat space for different @xmath11 values , including the most likely value @xmath53 as inferred from the wmap observations ( hinshaw et al .",
    "we see that at large redshifts , the parallax distances calculated from the modified expressions could be lower than from the uncorrected ones by as much as a factor of three or more in the currently favoured cosmologies ( viz .",
