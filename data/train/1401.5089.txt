    "in recent times , there has been a huge interest to see what quantum entanglement @xcite can teach us about gravity . certain entanglement measures such as relative entropy @xcite , which roughly speaking tells us how distinguishable two states are , need to be positive in a unitary theory .",
    "the positivity of this quantity was studied in holographic field theories with two derivative gravity duals in @xcite  related work include @xcite . in the context of quantum field theories with holographic dual gravity descriptions",
    ", one can ask what this inequality translates into .",
    "furthermore , the ryu - takayanagi prescription @xcite ( and its extensions to more general gravity theories @xcite ) gives us a way to compute how the entangling surface extends into the bulk .",
    "for the vacuum state in a conformal field theory , one may expect that the surface closes off smoothly in the interior as can be checked by explicit calculations in einstein gravity . by demanding a smooth surface in the bulk",
    ", we can try to see if a general theory of gravity gets constrained",
    ". these will be the main questions of interest in this paper .",
    "let us begin by discussing relative entropy .",
    "relative entropy between two states @xmath0 and @xmath1 is defined as s(|)= ( ) - ( ) . as reviewed in appendix a , in quantum mechanics , this quantity is positive for a unitary theory . in @xcite ,",
    "relative entropy was discussed in the holographic context .",
    "the state @xmath1 was chosen to be the reduced density matrix for a spherical entangling surface . in this case , @xmath2 with @xmath3 being the modular hamiltonian .",
    "it can be easily shown that ( see eg.@xcite ) [ dhds ] s(|)=h - s , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 with @xmath6 being the von neumann entropy for @xmath0 and is the entanglement entropy for a reduced density matrix @xmath0 .",
    "then the positivity of @xmath7 would require , hs .",
    "now we can calculate the modular hamiltonian for the sphere @xcite , from the formula , [ modh ] h=2_r < rd^d-1 x t_00 . here",
    "@xmath8 is the @xmath9-dimensional field theory stress tensor and @xmath10 is the time - time component . we know how to compute @xmath8 in holography .",
    "the ryu - takayanagi prescription ( and known generalizations ) gives us a way to compute @xmath11 .",
    "thus we can check if and how the inequality @xmath12 is satisfied . in @xcite ,",
    "many examples were considered and in each case it was shown that this inequality is respected in einstein gravity . if we consider a small excitation around the vacuum state then to linear order in the perturbation @xmath13 .",
    "this can be shown to be equivalent with the linearized einstein equations @xcite .",
    "this equality has been recently shown to hold for a general higher derivative theory of gravity @xcite .",
    "it is thus very interesting to ask what constraints we get at the nonlinear order .",
    "we will address this question for the special case of a constant stress tensor for the case where the holographic entanglement entropy is given by the ryu - takayanagi prescription  in other words , we will ask if even at non - linear level we get einstein gravity .",
    "we find that the constraints arising from relative entropy give us a larger class of models than just einstein gravity .",
    "however , we show that there exists matter stress tensor for which the bulk null energy condition is violated everywhere except at the einstein point .",
    "this in turn implies that relative entropy can continue to be positive although the bulk null energy condition is violated .",
    "in fact we can ask the question the other way round : are there examples where the relative entropy is negative but the bulk null energy condition still holds ? we will give an example where this happens .",
    "thus the connection between energy conditions and the positivity of relative entropy , which in some sense is reminiscent of the connection between energy conditions and the laws of thermodynamics , appears to be less direct than what one would have expected .    in order to get some intuition about what feature of gravity ensures the positivity of relative entropy , we extend the calculations in @xcite to higher derivative theories . in particular we focus on gauss - bonnet gravity in 5 bulk dimensions @xcite since in this context there is a derivation @xcite of the corresponding entropy functional @xcite .",
    "we find that in all examples that we consider , the positivity of the two point function of the stress tensor guarantees that the relative entropy is positive . in particular we show this for a constant field theory stress tensor as well as for a disturbance that is far from the entangling surface .",
    "the inequality for relative entropy can only be explicitly checked when the modular hamiltonian is known .",
    "unfortunately , currently this is not known for cases when the entangling region is a cylinder or a slab . from explicit calculations in the context of einstein gravity",
    ", it is known that the entangling surfaces for sphere , cylinder and the slab in the bulk corresponding to the vacuum state close off smoothly .",
    "the entangling surface equation gets modified in the presence of higher derivative corrections .",
    "the smoothness of the surface imposes constraints on the higher derivative coupling constants . for the slab",
    ", this question was addressed in @xcite .",
    "we will extend this calculation to the other two cases and find bounds on the gauss - bonnet coupling constant .",
    "we will find that this simple criterion leads to somewhat weaker constraints on the coupling as compared to what arises from micro - causality considerations @xcite .",
    "however , quite curiously , the bounds are in good agreement with the @xmath14 bounds @xcite for a non - supersymmetric field theory .    this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we consider constraints arising from the positivity of relative entropy in a holographic set up where the entanglement entropy is given by the ryu - takayanagi entropy functional .",
    "these constraints arise at a quadratic order in a perturbation with a constant field theory stress tensor . in section 3",
    ", we turn to the study of relative entropy in gauss - bonnet holography . in section 4",
    ", we investigate the relative entropy for an anisotropic plasma which breaks conformal invariance .",
    "we find that the relative entropy in this case is negative and we suggest some possible explanations for this . in section 5 ,",
    "we derive constraints on the gauss - bonnet coupling by demanding that the entangling surface extending into the bulk closes off smoothly .",
    "we conclude with open problems in section 6 .",
    "the appendices contain further calculations relevant for the rest of the paper .",
    "we will use capital latin letters to indicate bulk indices and greek letters to indicate boundary indices .",
    "lower case latin letters will indicate an index pertaining to the co - dimension 2 entangling surface . + * note added : * the paper by erdmenger et al @xcite which appeared on the same day in the arxiv , deals with a related idea of looking for pathological surfaces in certain higher derivative theories of gravity .",
    "in this section we will use the results in @xcite to derive certain constraints at nonlinear order that arise due to the positivity of relative entropy . in fefferman - graham coordinates",
    ", the bulk metric can be written as [ fgmetric ] ds^2= dz^2+g_dx^dx^. for einstein gravity , the bulk equations of motion allow us to systematically solve for @xmath15 as an expansion around the boundary @xmath16 ( see eg.@xcite ) .",
    "the idea here is to see what mileage we get if we do not know what the bulk theory is but we demand that the relative entropy calculated using the ryu - takayanagi entropy functional is positive .",
    "we want to calculate the quadratic correction to the entanglement entropy for the following form of boundary metric , [ metricpert ] g_= , where @xmath17 .",
    "this form is consistent with lorentz invariance for a constant @xmath8 .",
    "we will treat @xmath8 as a small perturbation to the vacuum . at linearized order",
    ", it has been shown in @xcite einstein equations arise from the condition @xmath13 .",
    "we wish to investigate what happens at the next order . we will keep @xmath18 and @xmath19 arbitrary and derive constraints on them arising from the inequality @xmath20 .",
    "our analysis follows @xcite very closely , the only change being that we will not specify @xmath18 and @xmath19 to be the einstein values .",
    "since at linear order ( the argument will be reviewed in the next section ) we have the equality @xmath13 and since @xmath21 from the holographic calculation is just given by the coefficient of the @xmath22 term in the metric , the inequality implies @xmath23 at quadratic order .",
    "thus our task is to calculate @xmath24 , the quadratic correction to @xmath11 , as a function of @xmath25 .",
    "the analysis below is valid for @xmath26 .",
    "we start with the ryu - takayanagi prescription for calculating entanglement entropy in holography , [ rt ] s = d^d-1x . from taylor expansion",
    "one can show that the quadratic correction to @xmath27 is , ^(2)=(h^ijh_ij)^2 +  h^ij h_ij+",
    "h^ij^(2 ) h_ij .",
    "the induced metric is , h_ij = g_ij+_i z _ j z .",
    "this is evaluated at the extremal surface @xmath28 .",
    "hence , at 0-th order , the metric and its inverse are , h_ij= ( _ ij+ ) h^ij= ( ^ij- ) . in @xmath24",
    ", we get 3 kinds of second order contributions . to be systematic ,",
    "we write , [ 3cont ] d^d-1x  ^(2)=a_(2,0)+a_(2,1)+a_(2,2 ) , where schematically , these are the @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 contributions respectively . to calculate the first term",
    ", we can set @xmath32",
    ". then h_ij = al^2 z^d-2 t_ij = a^2l^2z_0 ^ 2d-2(n_1t_it_j^+n_2  _ ijt_t^ ) .",
    "this gives , @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the last two terms in ( [ 3cont ] ) are same as they appear in @xcite . quoting the result , a_(2,1)=l^d-1ad^d-1x , a_(2,2)=l^d-1d^d-1x .",
    "we can find @xmath36 by minimizing @xmath37 , which gives , z_1=-(t+t_x ) . plugging this and summing we get from eq.([3cont ] ) , [ 7coeff ] d^d-1x  ^(2)=l^d-1a^2d^d-1x  ( c_1t^2+c_2t_x^2+c_3t_ij^2+c_4t_i0t^i0+c_5+c_6 + c_7tt_x ) ,",

    ". the final result comes out in the form , in @xcite after substituting for @xmath25 is off by a factor of @xmath46 although the overall sign is correct .",
    "this appears to be related to the opposite sign used for @xmath47 .",
    "we have cross - checked our results on mathematica for various cases and the notebook may be made available on request . ]",
    "d^d-1x = a^2l^d-1_d-2 ( c_1t^2+c_2t_ij^2+c_3t_i0 ^ 2 ) , with c_1= , c_2=(-1 - 2 d+4 ( d+1 ) n_1 + 4 ( d^2 - 1 ) n_2 ) , c_3=- .",
    "now we must demand that @xmath48 .",
    "we can write @xmath49 with @xmath50 being a @xmath51 dimensional vector with the independent components of @xmath8 as its components .",
    "then demanding that the eigenvalues of @xmath52 are @xmath53 will ensure @xmath54 .",
    "this leads to @xmath55 we get the region indicated in fig.1 allowed by this set of inequalities .",
    "one interesting observation is that when @xmath56 , then the allowed region becomes the interval @xmath57 with @xmath58 coinciding with the einstein result .",
    "the area of the triangle is given by = .",
    "notice that the ( extrapolated ) area@xmath59 is infinity .",
    "this makes sense since in @xmath60 we expect constraints on only 2 eigenvalues ( since @xmath61 and @xmath62 are no longer independent ) which will give us an unbounded region .",
    "further area@xmath63 which leads to a line interval for @xmath56 as shown in fig.1 .    at this stage",
    ", we have a wider class of theories that are allowed by the inequality than the einstein theory .",
    "the other theories need extra matter in addition to einstein gravity to support them . as such",
    "we could ask if the matter needed satisfies the null energy condition .     we get the allowed @xmath64 region to be the blue triangle above for a generic stress tensor .",
    "the region above the blue solid line and below the blue dashed and dotted lines are allowed from the relative entropy positivity . for @xmath56",
    "the region collapses to a line @xmath57 indicated in green .",
    "the einstein value @xmath65 is shown by the black dot .",
    "the region below the solid red line and above the dashed and dotted red lines are allowed by the null energy condition . by turning on a generic component of the stress tensor only the einstein value",
    "is picked out . by switching off certain components of the stress tensor ,",
    "various bands bounded by the solid , dashed and dotted lines are picked out . ]    as an example consider turning on a constant @xmath66 in @xmath67 .",
    "then we find r_ab - g_ab(r+)=t^bulk_ab , with @xmath68 working to be t^bulk_ab=16 z^6 t_01 ^ 2 . here",
    "@xmath69 and @xmath70 . using this",
    "we find that the null energy condition @xmath71 leads to @xmath72 with @xmath73 .",

    "first , we started with the ryu - takayanagi entropy functional ( which holds for einstein gravity ) and considered what constraints arise at nonlinear order on the metric by demanding that relative entropy is positive . at linearlized level",
    ", it is now known that for the spherical entangling surface @xmath13 leads to linearized equations for any higher derivative theory of gravity @xcite .",
    "we considered a constant field theory stress tensor . at the next order",

    "these were more general than what arises from einstein gravity .",
    "we analysed energy conditions for matter that could support these additional theories .",
    "we showed that the additional theories could be supported by matter that violates the null energy condition .",
    "in other words , holographic relative entropy can be positive although the bulk null energy condition is violated .",
    "it is an important open problem to understand if this feature persists for a more general stress tensor .",
    "we also gave an example of a model which corresponds to an anisotropic plasma , where for small anisotropy , the relative entropy is negative .",
    "this occurred even though the bulk stress tensor satisfied the null energy condition .",
    "we gave some possible explanations for this .",
    "we will leave further investigations of similar models as an open problem .",
    "second , we analysed the inequality in gauss - bonnet gravity for a given class of small perturbations around the vacuum state .",
    "we found that for all our examples , the positivity of the stress tensor two point function ascertained that this inequality was respected . on the bulk side this corresponds to metric fluctuations having positive energy .",

    "it will be interesting to extend our analysis to other higher derivative theories like the quasi - topological gravity @xcite where we expect the entropy functional to be simple .",
    "some preliminary studies of the general four derivative theory has been made in appendix c. another interesting open problem is to consider a disturbance close to the entangling surface .",
    "we were able to consider a disturbance that was localized far from the entangling surface and show that the relative entropy is positive . whether the constraints change as one moves",
    "the disturbance closer to the entangling surface is an open problem .",
    "finally , we also considered other entangling surfaces and demanded that these close off smoothly in the bulk . in gauss - bonnet gravity , this led to the coupling being constrained .",
    "the spherical entangling surface did not lead to any constraints on the coupling while the cylindrical and slab entangling surfaces did .",
