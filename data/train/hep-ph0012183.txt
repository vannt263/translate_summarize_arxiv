    "hadronic matrix elements of flavor - changing currents are of paramount importance to the phenomenology of weak decays .",
    "they appear , e.g. , in the theoretical description of semileptonic @xmath2 decays .",
    "these processes give direct access to the elements @xmath4 and @xmath1 of the quark - mixing matrix , provided the hadronic matrix elements are known from some nonperturbative computation . for inclusive semileptonic decays , the matrix elements can be calculated using a short - distance expansion in the large @xmath5-quark mass .",
    "improving the theoretical accuracy in the determinations of @xmath1 is currently one of the most important challenges in heavy - flavor theory .",
    "relevant to the determination of @xmath1 are hadronic matrix elements of the weak current @xmath6 . in general , local current operators composed of a heavy quark @xmath7 and a light quark",
    "@xmath8 exhibit an interesting behavior under renormalization at scales below the heavy - quark mass .",
    "large logarithms of the type @xmath9 arise from the exchange of gluons that are hard with respect to the light quark but soft with respect to the heavy quark .",
    "since such gluons see the heavy quark as a static color source , their effects can be investigated systematically in the framework of the heavy - quark effective theory ( hqet ) , which provides a systematic expansion of matrix elements in inverse powers and logarithms of @xmath10 @xcite . in the hqet ,",
    "the four - component heavy - quark field is replaced by a velocity - dependent two - component field @xmath11 satisfying @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the four - velocity of the hadron containing the heavy quark .",
    "operators in the effective theory have a different evolution than in usual qcd .",
    "for instance , whereas the vector current @xmath14 is conserved in qcd ( i.e. , its anomalous dimension vanishes ) , the corresponding current @xmath15 in the hqet has a nontrivial anomalous dimension , which governs its renormalization - group ( rg ) evolution for scales below @xmath10 .    as an example , consider the heavy - quark expansion of the vector current ( neglecting the light - quark mass @xmath16 ) @xcite @xmath17 where the symbol @xmath18 is used to indicate that this is a relation that holds after taking matrix elements on both sides .",
    "( in a regularization scheme with anticommuting @xmath19 , the expansion of the axial - vector current is obtained by replacing @xmath20 in the hqet operators . )",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 are the effective operators entering at leading order in the expansion .",
    "the operators @xmath23 appearing at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) form a basis of dimension-4 operators in the hqet that closes under renormalization .",
    "the standard choice of these operators is ( using the notation @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) @xmath26 and @xmath27 in addition to the local operators @xmath28 , there appear four bilocal operators @xmath29 built from time - ordered products of the leading - order currents with an insertion of the `` kinetic operator '' @xmath30 or the `` chromo - magnetic operator '' @xmath31 .",
    "these operators appear at order @xmath0 in the effective lagrangian of the hqet .",
    "part of their effect is to take into account the expansion of the external hadron states in terms of states of the effective theory @xcite .",
    "the wilson coefficients of these nonlocal operators are given by the products of the coefficients of their component operators , i.e. , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the coefficient of the chromo - magnetic operator in the hqet lagrangian , which has been calculated at nlo in @xcite .",
    "the kinetic operator is not renormalized @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the wilson coefficients @xmath34 and @xmath35 at nlo in rg - improved perturbation theory requires one - loop matching at the scale @xmath36 and two - loop anomalous dimensions in the effective theory .",
    "the leading - order coefficients @xmath34 have been computed long ago @xcite .",
    "the calculation at order @xmath0 is , however , much more complicated .",
    "the leading logarithmic corrections were obtained in @xcite .",
    "first steps towards a nlo analysis were made in @xcite , where the one - loop matching calculations were computed , and general arguments based on the reparameterization invariance @xcite of the hqet were used to derive the exact relations ( valid to all orders in perturbation theory ) @xmath37 moreover , it was shown that the @xmath38 anomalous dimension matrix governing the mixing of the operators @xmath23 under rg transformations has the texture @xmath39 where @xmath40 here @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the anomalous dimensions of the leading - order heavy ",
    "light currents @xmath43 and of the chromo - magnetic operator , respectively .",
    "the matrix @xmath44 describing the mixing of the local operators",
    "@xmath45 into @xmath46 has been calculated at two - loop order in @xcite .",
    "explicit expression for the two - loop anomalous dimensions will be presented in section  [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "it was observed in @xcite that there are numerically large discrepancies between the one - loop and leading - logarithmic approximations to the wilson coefficients @xmath35 , which could only be resolved at nlo in rg - improved perturbation theory .",
    "the missing piece in the nlo analysis is the calculation of the anomalous dimension matrix @xmath47 describing the mixing of the bilocal operators @xmath29 into the local operators @xmath46 . in this paper , we report the calculation of this matrix at two - loop order .",
    "it requires the evaluation of two - loop tensor integrals in the hqet , which are infrared ( ir ) singular when one of the external lines is taken on - shell .",
    "a general algorithm for computing such integrals has been developed in @xcite . for our analysis",
    "we will generalize the above discussion and consider an arbitrary dirac structure @xmath48 of the current @xmath49 in the time - ordered products .",
    "at the end we will study the particular case of vector currents in detail .",
    "the reader interested only in the final results of our calculation but not its technical details can continue with section  [ sec : analysis ] , where we present the final expressions for the wilson coefficients @xmath35 at nlo and briefly discuss some phenomenological applications .",
    "our task is to calculate , at two - loop order , the mixing of bilocal operators , consisting of time - ordered products of a local current @xmath49 with either the kinetic operator or the chromo - magnetic operator , into local dimension-4 current operators with a derivative acting on the light - quark field . here",
    "@xmath48 can be an arbitrary dirac matrix , depending on the lorentz structure of the original current that is expanded in terms of hqet operators .",
    "we start by constructing , in the hqet , a basis of the relevant operators that mix under renormalization .",
    "since ultimately our interest is in the matrix elements of these operators between physical hadron states , it is sufficient to consider gauge - invariant operators that do not vanish by the equations of motions . for the case where the bilocal operator contains the kinetic operator , such a basis consists of the two operators",
