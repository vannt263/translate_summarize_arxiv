    "hyper - dense small - cell deployments are expected to play a pivotal role in delivering high capacity and reliability by bringing the network closer to users  @xcite . however , in order to make hyper - dense deployments a reality , enhancements including effective interference management , self - organization , and energy efficiency are required  @xcite . given that large - scale deployments composed of hundreds or thousands of network elements can increase the energy consumption substantially , the need for energy efficiency ( _ green communications _ ) has been recognized by the cellular communications industry as an important item in research projects and standardization activities  @xcite .",
    "initial attempts to improve the energy efficiency in cellular networks were oriented towards minimizing the power radiated through the air interface , which in turn reduces the electromagnetic pollution and its potential effects on human health",
    ". however , most of the energy consumption ( between 50% to 80% ) in the radio access network takes place in base stations  ( bss )  @xcite and it is largely independent of the bss load .",
    "since cellular networks are dimensioned to meet the service demand in _ the busy hour _  ( i.e. ,  peak demand ) , it is expected that , under non - uniform demand distributions  ( both in space and time ) , a substantial portion of the resources may end up being underutilized , thus incurring in an unnecessary expenditure of energy .",
    "the problem may become worse in many of the scenarios foreseen for 5 g , presumably characterized by hyper - dense small - cell deployments , hierarchical architectures , and highly heterogeneous service demand conditions  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the idea of switching off lightly loaded base stations has been considered recently as a promising method to reduce the energy consumption in cellular networks .",
    "this framework is referred to as cell switch - off  ( cso ) and it is focused on determining the largest set of cells that can be switched off without compromising the quality - of - service  ( qos ) provided to users .",
    "unfortunately , cso is difficult to carry out due to the fact that it represents a highly challenging ( combinatorial ) optimization problem whose complexity grows exponentially with the number of bss , and hence , finding optimal solutions is not possible in polynomial time .",
    "moreover , the implementation of cso requires coordination among neighbor cells and several other practical aspects , such as coverage provision and the need for minimizing the number of ( induced ) handovers and transitions . in practice",
    ", optimizing the number of transitions , as well as the time required for them , is advisable because switching on / off bss is far from being a simple procedure , and indeed , this process must be gradual and controlled  @xcite .",
    "moreover , a large number of transitions could result in a high number of handovers with a potentially negative impact on qos  @xcite .",
    "although cso is a relatively young research topic , a significant amount of contributions has been made .",
    "hence , an exhaustive survey is both out of the scope and not feasible herein . instead , a literature review including , in the opinion of the authors , some of the most representative works is provided .",
    "thus , in the comparative perspective shown in table  [ tablerelatedwork ] , the following criteria have been considered :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tablenotation ]",
    "in order to study the tradeoffs in cso , the use of multiobjective optimization has been considered .",
    "multiobjective optimization is the discipline that focuses on the resolution of the problems involving the simultaneous optimization of several conflicting objectives , and hence , it is a convenient tool to investigate cso , where the two fundamental metrics , energy consumption and network capacity , are in conflict .",
    "the target is to find a subset of _ good _ solutions @xmath0 from a set @xmath1 according to a set of criteria @xmath2 , with cardinality @xmath3 greater than one . in general , the objectives are in conflict , and so , improving one of them implies worsening another .",
    "consequently , it makes no sense to talk about a single global optimum , and hence , the notion of an optimum set @xmath0 becomes very important . a central concept in multiobjective",
    "optimization is pareto efficiency .",
    "a solution @xmath4 has pareto efficiency if and only if there does not exist a solution @xmath5 , such that @xmath6 dominates @xmath7 .",
    "a solution @xmath8 is preferred to ( dominates ) another solution @xmath9 , ( @xmath10 ) , if @xmath8 is better than @xmath9 in at least one criterion and not worse than any of the remaining ones .",
    "the set @xmath0 of pareto efficient solutions is called optimal nondominated set and its image is known as the optimal pareto front ( opf ) . in multiobjective optimization , it is unusual to obtain the opf due to problem complexity ; instead , a near - optimal or estimated pareto front ( pf ) is found .",
    "readers are referred to  @xcite for an in - depth discussion .",
    "the following performance metrics have been considered is not explicit , however , it is important to note that all of them depend on @xmath11 , i.e. , the network topology . ] :    * _ the number of active cells _ ( @xmath12 ) . under the full - load assumption ,",
    "energy consumption is proportional to the number of active cells  @xcite : @xmath13 * _ average network capacity _",
    "( @xmath14 ) .",
    "this metric is based on the expected value of the spectral efficiency at area element level .",
    "hence , the effect of the spatial service demand distribution ( @xmath15 ) must be considered .",
    "the metric is defined as follows : @xmath16\\odot \\mathbf{n } \\right]\\cdot \\mathbf{1}.                          \\label{eq : cso_f2}\\ ] ] the vector @xmath17 corresponds to the _ weighted _ spectral efficiency of each area element .",
    "the idea is to give more importance to the network topologies ( @xmath11 s ) that provide better aggregate capacity ( @xmath14 ) to the areas with higher service demand . in  ( [ eq : cso_f2 ] ) ,",
    "@xmath18 ( the number of area elements ) is used to normalize the obtained capacity to the uniform distribution case , i.e. , @xmath19 .",
    "the vector  @xmath20 contains the inverse of the sum of each column in @xmath21 , i.e. , the number of pixels served by each cell .",
    "it is assumed that each user is served by one cell at a  time .",
    "this vector is used to distribute the capacity of each cell evenly over its coverage area , i.e. , the bandwidth is shared equally by the area elements belonging to each cell .",
    "this improves the fairness in the long run similar to the proportional fairness policy that tends to share the resources equally among users as time passes .",
    "this fairness notion results in decreasing the individual rates as the number of users increases .",
    "this effect is also captured by @xmath22 as the bandwidth per area element is inversely proportional to the size of the  cell .",
    "* _ cell edge performance _",
    "( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the @xmath24 percentile of the pixel rate cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) is commonly used to provide an indicator for cell edge performance  @xcite .",
    "a vector with the weighted average rate at area element level can be obtained as follows : @xmath25 .",
    "\\label{eq : cso_f3}\\ ] ] then , the percentile 5 is given by @xmath26 the vector @xmath27 is a sorted ( ascending order ) version of @xmath28 . * _ uplink power consumption _ ( @xmath29 ) . in order to provide an estimate of the uplink power consumption of any network topology , a fractional compensation similar to the open loop power control  ( olpc ) used in long term evolution  ( lte )",
    "is considered  @xcite .",
    "it is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a design parameter that depends on the allocated bandwidth and target signal - to - noise ratio  ( snr ) and @xmath32 $ ] is the ( network controlled ) fractional compensation factor .",
    "* _ load dependent power consumption _ ( @xmath33 ) . in order to estimate the network power consumption under the load coupling assumption ,",
    "the parameterized bs power model proposed in  @xcite has been used .",
    "thus , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a function that gives the power consumption in the @xmath36  bs as function of its load . essentially , in this model , there is a fixed power consumption ( @xmath31 ) that is independent of the load but that can be further reduced ( till @xmath37 ) if the base station is switched - off .",
    "moreover , there is a part that grows linearly with the load till a maximum power consumption ( @xmath38 ) that obviously contains the transmitted power over the air interface ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "* _ load dispersion _ ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "as it will be shown , load dispersion in load coupling conditions is an important parameter because it measures how well distributed the service demand is . in order to quantify this value ,",
    "the coefficient of variation is considered .",
    "thus , @xmath41 * _ handovers_. in the context of cso , handovers are a quite important concern  @xcite .",
    "handovers are produced when users need to be associated to another base station because their serving cells are switched - off . in practice ,",
    "handovers are mainly produced due to users mobility , but independently of the type , either user- or network - triggered , handovers require a certain time and signaling , both at the air interface and core network .",
    "thus , the cso operation should , as much as possible , minimize the number of handover , i.e. , the transition from one topology to another should be done with the minimal impact and/or cost .",
    "a pictorial representation of the aforementioned situation is shown in figure  [ fig : handovers ] .",
    "thus , handovers are considered herein as an important performance metric .",
    "the multiobjective optimization problem considered herein can be formulated as follows :    [ op : cso ] @xmath42 , \\label{op : cso : main}\\\\                          \\text{subject to : } & \\nonumber\\\\[-0.0 cm ]                          \\textcolor[rgb]{1,1,1}{.}&\\hspace{0.5 cm } \\left(a^{-1}\\cdot\\left(\\mathbf{v}^{\\text{t}}\\cdot\\mathbf{1}\\right)\\right)\\hspace{0.1cm}\\leq\\hspace{0.1cm}\\kappa_{\\text{cov } } , \\label{op : cso : c1}\\\\[-0.05 cm ]                          \\textcolor[rgb]{1,1,1}{.}&\\hspace{0.5 cm } \\mathbf{x}\\in\\{0,1\\}^l,\\hspace{0.1cm}\\mathbf{x}\\neq \\mathbf{0}.    \\label{op : cso : c3 }                      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    problem   proposes the simultaneous optimization of two of the previously introduced performance metrics as follows :    * full load : if full load is assumed as model for intercell interference , @xmath43 and @xmath44 in  . *",
    "load coupling : if load coupling is assumed as model for intercell interference , @xmath45 and @xmath46 in  .",
    "the previous optimization scheme allows to study and characterized the tradeoffs between conflicting metrics ( see section  [ sec : propframework_probform_fl ] ) in a deployment - specific manner .",
    "constraints  and   correspond to the coverage criterion and feasible set definition , respectively .    in general , solving multiobjective problems such as is very difficult  @xcite . indeed , ( [ op : cso ] ) is a combinatorial problem that belongs to the class np - complete , and hence , optimal solutions can not be found in polynomial time .",
    "the domain ( search space ) defined by the optimization variable ( @xmath11 , the on / off pattern ) is a set of size @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the number of bss",
    ". the objective space ( or _ image _ ) is defined by the objective functions , and due to their mathematical structure , it is highly non - linear , non - convex , and full of discontinuities and local optima  @xcite .",
    "certain algorithms such as simplex  @xcite are susceptible to be trapped in local optima , while other optimization techniques , such as sequential quadratic programming @xcite , require convexity to guarantee convergence .",
    "moreover , traditional constrained optimization , in which only one objective function is optimized subject to a set of constraints on the remaining ones , has the drawback of limiting the visibility of the whole objective space . for this reason , _",
    "heuristic_-based algorithms are popular approaches in cso as it was seen in section  [ sec : intro ] , but unfortunately , by means of this type of solutions it is very difficult to address multiobjective optimization problems . in order to overcome this difficulty , the use of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms  ( moeas )  @xcite",
    "is proposed herein as described next .",
    "as it was mentioned , heuristic solutions are usually problem - specific and typically used for single - objective optimization .",
    "thus , the so - called ` _ _ metaheuristics _ _ ' have become an active research field  @xcite .",
    "metaheuristics can be used to solve very general kind of multiobjective optimization problems , such as the cso formulation presented herein .",
    "indeed , requires a tool able to  1 )  find good solutions by efficiently exploring the search space , and  2 )  operate efficiently with multiple criteria and a large number of design variables .",
    "in addition , it should not have strong requirements , such as convexity or continuity .",
    "multiobjective evolutionary algorithms  ( moeas )  @xcite fulfill the previous goals , and hence , their use is proposed to deal with the cso framework presented herein .",
    "moeas are population - based metaheuristics that simulate the process of natural evolution and they are convenient due to their _ black - box _ nature that requires no assumption on the objective functions .    thus , the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm ii  ( nsga - ii )  @xcite is employed herein to solve  ( [ op : cso ] ) .",
    "nsga - ii is accepted and well - recognized as a reference in the field of evolutionary optimization as it has desirable features , such as _ elitism _ ( the ability to preserve good solutions ) , and mechanisms to flexibly improve _ convergence _ and _ distribution_. further details can be found in  @xcite .",
    "one key insight for selecting evolutionary ( genetic ) algorithms is that , in cso , a certain correlation is expected among network topologies that are suitable for a given spatial service demand distribution , i.e. , they are expected to be similar , with more cells where the traffic is concentrated . the operation in evolutionary algorithms",
    "precisely does that , i.e. , once a good ( pareto efficient ) solution ( network topology ) is found , the algorithm iteratively try to improve it by  1 )  combining it with other good solutions ( _ crossover _ mechanism ) , and 2 )  adding random minor variations to them ( _ mutation _ mechanism ) .",
    "the complete description of nsga - ii can be found in  @xcite .",
    "as it will be shown , the use of moeas provides a quite convenient approach to cso .",
    "however , depending on the scale of the problem , convergence can be slow , especially if computational resources are limited .",
    "thus , based on the insight previously indicated , and in order to provide additional possibilities , algorithm  [ alg : cso : mindist ] is also proposed for solving ( finding the set @xmath0 of pareto efficient solutions ) a particular , yet important , case of ( [ op : cso ] ) ; when the number of active cells ( @xmath12 ) and the average network capacity ( @xmath14 ) need to be jointly optimized .",
    "given that the need for minimizing the number of transitions is very important from a practical point of view , algorithm  [ alg : cso : mindist ] aims at finding a collection of network topologies , all with different number of active bss , featuring  1 )  the minimum distance property , and  2 )  acceptable performance .",
    "in this context , the word  _ distance _ refers to the hamming distance ( @xmath49 ) , i.e. , the number of positions in which the corresponding symbols in two different solutions are different . in this manner , for two solutions @xmath50 and @xmath51 in a set @xmath52 featuring the minimum distance property , always holds .",
    "initially , algorithm  [ alg : cso : mindist ] determines the best  topology with  1  active bs  ( @xmath53 ) in line  2 .",
    "then , in lines  4 - 14 , for each successive number of active cells ( @xmath54 ) , the algorithm sequentially finds the bss that should be activated ( resulting in the solution @xmath51 ) , such that  1 )  the hamming distance with the previous solution @xmath55 is one , and 2 )  the function @xmath14 is maximized .",
    "thus , each solution added to @xmath56 provides the biggest increment in terms of @xmath14 with respect to the one previously added , and only one off / on transition is required .",
    "it should be noted that , although not explicitly indicated , algorithm  [ alg : cso : mindist ] indeed optimizes not only the number of active base stations and the network capacity , but also the number of transitions when moving from one topology to another .",
    "thus , more than two objetives are jointly considered .",
    "the same applies for  , i.e. , more than two metrics could be considered , at expense of an increase in complexity , but it should be taken into account that in the context of cso , a pareto front in more than two dimensions could complicate the implementation .",
    "figure  [ fig : conceptual_design ] illustrates the conceptual design of the proposed multiobjective framework .",
    "the framework relies on having a statistical description of the behavior of the service demand ( in time and space ) .",
    "thus , by means of different traffic distributions ( @xmath57 ) , the spatial component of the traffic at different moments of the day can be captured .",
    "these patterns can be considered fairly constant during time intervals of _ small _ duration ( tens of minutes or few hours )  @xcite .",
    "starting from the knowledge of a given @xmath15 , network analysis and optimization based on ( [ op : cso ] ) is done offline .",
    "the main idea is that , for different demand conditions ( spatial distribution and volume ) , different sets of pareto efficient network topologies can be obtained , i.e. , for each @xmath57 , there is a corresponding @xmath58 .",
    "these sets of near - optimal solutions ( @xmath58 s ) can be evaluated by means of system level simulations ( in which several qos criteria , scheduling policies , and ici models can be considered independently ) in order to determine which network topologies ( @xmath59 ) provide the desired level of qos .",
    "obviously , the network operator may act rather conservatively in this selection process as it will be explained in section  [ sec : evasetparameters ] .",
    "moreover , in order to allow for semi - distributed implementation , a cluster - based operation is encouraged .",
    "the benefit of doing so is twofold .",
    "first , the demand in relatively small areas covered by small cells ( e.g. , pico - cells in a university campus ) can be characterized easily .",
    "second , the amount of intercell coordination is reduced compared with the schemes aiming at operating in large urban areas .",
    "since demand profiles are stored and indexed at coordinating points in each cluster , the amount of data that need to be exchanged ( from time to time ) is negligible . instead",
    ", different clusters ( a certain amount of overlapping can be allowed ) can also share information in longer time scales , so that better decisions can be made in boundary cells . in any case , the idea of identifying traffic profiles and applying multiobjective - optimized on / off patterns , is compatible with novel paradigms that 1 )  are being considered for 5 g ( _ cloud - networking _ and _ virtualization _",
    "@xcite ) and  2 )  would allow for more dynamic and centralized operation .",
    "in addition , several research contributions in the increasingly research field of service demand modeling and pattern recognition  @xcite ( a research problem out of our scope ) are appearing , and hence , the method proposed herein can extensively be benefit from that activity .",
    "+    the simulation setup is based on the assumptions for evaluating the imt - advanced systems  @xcite .",
    "the urban micro - cell ( umi ) downlink scenario was chosen .",
    "[ fig : layout ] shows the corresponding cellular layout .",
    "as it can be seen , the network is composed of 37 small cells ( radius = @xmath60 m , @xmath61 ) .",
    "[ fig : std ] corresponds to the ( irregular ) spatial service demand distribution ( @xmath62 ) used in the numerical examples .",
    "the kullback - leiber distance @xmath63 with respect to the uniform distribution  ( @xmath64 ) can be used as a measure of the non - uniformity of the spatial service demand distribution as it is shown in figure  [ fig : std_cdf ] .",
    "this setting is perfectly valid to study cso as in this context gains are obtained from the mismatch between demand and supply .",
    "indeed , cso is about finding the smallest network topology that is _ compatible _",
    "@xcite enough with the service demand to provide the required qos and coverage .    in this study , a single - input single - output  ( siso ) is considered .",
    "this assumption does not imply any loss of generality as long as all cells use the same scheme .",
    "the load - dependent power consumption model , based on the parameters given in  @xcite , for pico - bss assuming an operating bandwidth of @xmath65mhz and a maximum transmission power of @xmath66dbm is shown in  fig .",
    "[ fig : power_consumption_model ] .    dynamic system level simulations are carried based on monte  carlo experiments .",
    "the results compile statistics taken from 100  independent experiments each of which has a duration of @xmath67s . at each cell",
    ", the scheduler assigns each user with a bandwidth such that the target rate ( @xmath68 ) is satisfied .",
    "if the percentage of users that obtain a rate equal to @xmath68 is greater or equal to the operator - specific target qos ( @xmath69 ) , then the qos policy is said to be fulfilled .",
    "thus , in order to satisfy the maximum number of users , users are sorted based on their spectral efficiency and served accordingly .",
    "when there is not enough bandwidth to satisfy a user , the resource allocation ends .",

    "a comparison among solutions obtained through each ici model , fl and lc , is provided  next .      as indicated earlier , solving ( [ op : cso ] )",
    "results in a set of pareto efficient ( nondominated ) network topologies that are specific for either a spatial service demand distribution ( @xmath116 : full - load ) or a service demand conditions , i.e. , spatial demand distribution plus volume ( @xmath117 : load - coupling ) . recall that @xmath116 is obtained by joint optimizing @xmath12 and @xmath14 in ( [ op : cso ] ) for a given spatial demand distribution ( @xmath62 ) , while obtaining @xmath117 involves the joint optimization of @xmath33 and @xmath40 in ( [ op : cso ] ) for a given @xmath62 and @xmath108 ( volume ) .",

    "the goal is to create qos statistics for each network topology and load condition .",
    "then , the network topology that is able to provide the desired qos ( @xmath118 of users are satisfied @xmath118 of time ) is selected and applied ( as indicated in subsection  [ sec : propframework_conceptualdesign ] ) .",

    ", the topologies in @xmath117 result in lower power consumption as they feature less active bss ( nac is indicated in green boxes ) given that the load - coupling model predicts better sinr than full - load  ( see  fig .",

    "the results make evident that the performance of the network topologies in @xmath117 is severely degraded if the ici levels become higher than the ones from which they were calculated for , see  @xmath117@fl ( full ici ) . indeed , the performance of these solutions is sensitive to variations from the mean values ( that happens when considering snapshots ) in moderate - to - high load conditions , even when the load - coupling based ici is considered , as seen in fig .

    "provide consistent performance when they are evaluated under full load ( @xmath116@fl ) , and obviously , provide an even better performance under load - coupling  ( @xmath116@lc ) for both demand volumes .",
    "hence , given that the energy consumption gain is in the order of @xmath121 in the best case , it can be concluded that the full load model provides a competitive and somehow _ safer _ energy - saving vs. qos tradeoff in the context of cso .",
    "the proposed cso scheme can use either approach . summarizing :    *",
    "the mo for fl , i.e. , @xmath12 and @xmath14 in ( [ op : cso ] ) , is volume - independent ; offline system level simulations are required for each load condition ( @xmath108 ) , and energy saving is smaller in comparison to  lc . * in mo for lc ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath33 and @xmath40 in ( [ op : cso ] ) , is volume dependent ; different offline optimization procedures are required for each load condition ( @xmath108 ) , and energy saving is larger in comparison to  fc .      in order to provide a wide perspective of the merit of the cso framework presented herein ,",
    "several recent / representative cso schemes have been used as baselines .",
    "obviously , an exhaustive comparison is not feasible .",
    "however , the idea is to illustrate some _ pros _ and _ cons _ of different approaches and the impact of some design assumptions .",
    "the following benchmarks are considered :    * _ cell zooming _ : it was proposed in  @xcite .",
    "the idea is to sequentially switch - off bs starting from the lowest loaded .",
    "the algorithm ends when a cell can not be switched - off because at least one user can not be * _ improved cell zooming _ : this scheme is presented in  @xcite and it is similar to the one in  @xcite , but it includes a more flexible termination criterion that allows to check more cells before terminating , and so , more energy - efficient topologies can be found . *",
    "_ load - and - interference aware cso _ : the design of this cso scheme presented in  @xcite takes into account both the received interference and load of each cell to create a ranking that is used to sequentially switch - off the cells whose load is below a certain threshold . * _ set cover based cso _ :",
    "the cso scheme proposed in  @xcite relies on the idea of switch - on bs sequentially according to a certain sorting criterion . in this work ,",
    "the sorting criterion is based on the number of users a cell can served in the snr regime .",
    "the performance comparison is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : per_comp ] . to make the comparison fair ,",
    "the full - load ici conditions are considered .",
    "[ fig : bench_nel ]  and  [ fig : bench_qos ] show the average number of active cells and qos ( for different service demand volumes ) , respectively .",
    "as it can be seen , the best energy saving is obtained by  @xcite , although at the expense of qos degradations .",
    "this is due to the fact that in  @xcite , users can be easily put in outage .",
    "in contrast , cso schemes such as  @xcite provide the desired qos ( as long as @xmath122 ) since cso decisions require associating all users . however , this results in an increment in the average number of active cells with respect to  @xcite .",
    "the schemes labeled as ` mda ' and ` moea ' correspond to the ( infeasible ) dynamic selection of network topologies from the sets @xmath116 obtained through algorithms  [ alg : cso : mindist ] and nsga - ii , respectively , which are shown as reference .",
    "the performance of the proposed mo cso is indicated by red boxes and labeled as ` mo  cso ' .",
    "as it can be seen , the proposed scheme provides an excellent tradeoff between the required number of active cells and the obtained qos , especially when @xmath123 where the performance ( qos ) of other cso is compromised .",
    "however , the most significant enhancement in the proposed scheme is its feasibility .",
    "[ fig : bench_bars ] shows four performance indicators : transitions , handovers , qos , and nac .",
    "given that the network topologies are calculated offline , they can be evaluated extensively by means of system level simulations ( under a wide range of coverage criteria and conditions ) to further guarantee their real - time performance , i.e. , the operator can select topologies with more active cells rather than the ones which strictly need to guarantee qos .",
    "therefore , the selected network topologies can be applied ( without real - time complexity ) during periods of time in which service demand is described by @xmath62 ; as a result , no transitions or handovers are induced due to cso .",
    "hence , feasible yet effective cso performance is achieved . as it was shown earlier ,",
    "the proposed framework is generic , flexible , and no assumption are made in regards to , for instance , the cellular layout or objective functions ; as a result , the framework is also suitable for small - cell deployments where irregular topologies and heterogeneous demand conditions are expected .      to close this section , a complexity overview of the optimization algorithms is provided . according to  @xcite , the complexity of nsga - ii is @xmath124 , where @xmath125 and @xmath100 correspond to the population size and the number of objective functions , respectively . in our case ,",
    "@xmath126 and @xmath125 can be set depending on the scale of the problem . however , there is a consensus about the size of the population when using genetic algorithms , such as nsga - ii , and it is considered that during calibration populations of 20 up to 100 individuals can be used .",
    "values greater than 100 hardly achieve significant gains and the same global convergence is obtained  @xcite .",
    "regarding algorithm  [ alg : cso : mindist ] , it s complexity is @xmath98 , where @xmath48 is the number of cells in the network . in practice , @xmath127 which is a significant reduction in terms of complexity that comes at expense of some performance .",
    "in evolutionary algorithms , a termination criterion is usually defined / need .",
    "one metric used to measure the level of convergence is the the _ hypervolume _ indicator  @xcite .",
    "it reflects the size of volume dominated by the estimated pareto front . in this work",
    ", the seacrh is terminated if the improvement in the hypervolume is smaller than a threshold  ( 0.001% ) after a certain number of generations ( in this study , 20 ) .",
    "finally , crossover and mutation probabilities are set to @xmath128 and @xmath84 ( one mutation per solution , on average ) , respectively , as indicated in table  [ tableevaluationsetting ] .",
    "cso is a promising strategy that allows significant energy saving in cellular networks where both radio access network  ( capacity supply ) and service demand are heterogeneous . in this article  1 )  cso has been carefully analyzed considering coverage criteria , ici models , and practical aspects , such as network - initiated handovers and on - off / off - on transitions , and  2 )  a novel mo - based  cso scheme has been introduced .",
    "the proposed solution succeeds in minimizing the number of transitions and handovers caused by the cso operation and it is able to operate without need for heavy computational burden as the core processing is done offline .",
    "in addition , a cluster based - operation have been proposed to allow for semi - distributed implementation .",
    "the results show that , when compared with previous proposals , the proposed solution provides competitive performance in terms of qos and energy saving while offering clear advantages from the feasibility perspective as it reduces the number of handovers and transitions .",
    "the results also highlight the importance of considering coverage criteria ( in downlink and uplink ) and pay attention to the selection of operational parameters , e.g. , the power allocated to ps ( typically used as criterion for coverage ) .",
    "a comparative analysis between ici models ( full - load and load - coupling ) indicates that the full - load assumption is a _ safe _ approach in the context of cso as it provides natural protection against deviations from average load values that are 1 ) used as input of the algorithm , and  2 )  inherent of real time operation , i.e. , discrete realizations of users .",
    "the impact of cso on the power consumption of ue has also been studied .",
    "the results indicate that sparse topologies ( few active bss ) have a significant impact on uplink power consumption , and hence , cso is not suitable for scenarios with energy - sensitive devices such as sensor networks .",
    "research on topology adaptation has still a long way until its maturity .",
    "feasible and effective techniques for traffic pattern recognition to complement cso are still in infancy .",
    "it is our strong belief that cso , as a promising approach to _ greener _ networks , is a key piece of a more general set of capabilities that will appear in 5 g networks , also including promizing and disruptive concepts , such as downlink uplink decoupling  ( dude ) .",
    "dude , where user equipment can transmit and receive to and from different base stations , is indeed , a clear research direction from the perspective of cso , where both uplink and downlink could be considered as _",
    "independent _ networks .",

    "in order to estimate the average load vector ( @xmath129 ) , algorithm  [ alg : iteraproxloads ] is proposed .",
