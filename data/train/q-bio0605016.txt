    "the mammalian immune system relies critically on so - called t - cells , which recognize foreign antigens and trigger an immune response .",
    "the word `` antigen '' is derived from _ anti_body _ gen_erating ( indicating that antigens are molecules that can elicit an immune reaction ) .",
    "each individual is supplied with a large repertoire of different types of t - cells ( each defined by the special type of t - cell receptor exposed at its surface ) , and every type recognizes a certain repertoire of antigens .",
    "this recognition , in turn , starts a signalling cascade , which induces an immune response that finally leads to the elimination of the antigen ( janeway et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the t - cell repertoire of an organism must , on the one hand , recognize _ foreign _ antigens in a reliable way ; on the other hand , it must _ not _ respond to the body s _ own _ antigens , since this would elicit dangerous auto - immune reactions .",
    "how does this `` self - nonself distinction '' work ?",
    "this basic question of immunobiology has remained unanswered for a very long time .",
    "one fundamental difficulty lies in the fact that foreign antigens and self - antigens are very similar in nature .",
    "van den berg , rand and burroughs @xcite ( henceforth referred to as brb ) addressed this difficulty by modelling the _ probabilistic _ nature of the interactions between t - cell receptors and the antigens presented on the surface of so - called antigen - presenting cells ( apcs ) . a t - cell",
    "( with many copies of its given receptor ) encounters these apcs ( which carry a random mixture of antigens ) . by modelling these encounters as random events , and taking the interaction kinetics between t - cell receptors and antigens into account , brb have shown that the t - cell repertoire can distinguish reliably between apcs that carry foreign antigens and those that do not .    in order to validate the results of brb , we reconsider their model and refine its analysis . in mathematical terms",
    ", the model boils down to computing the distribution of a large sum of independent but not identically distributed random variables . since",
    "a t - cell response is a rare event ( for a randomly chosen encounter ) , the tail of the distribution is relevant  a situation that requires the use of _ large deviation theory_. specifically , we need the so - called _ exact asymptotics _ , as provided by the bahadur - rao theorem and a generalization proved by chaganty and sethuraman @xcite . with the help of this theorem , we find substantially elevated tail probabilities for the case where a foreign antigen is present in a fairly high copy number , relative to the self - background .",
    "abundance of the foreign antigen is biologically realistic , since pathogens multiply within the body and swamp it with their antigens before an immune response is started .",
    "furthermore , the requirement of a high copy number can be relaxed in a refined version of the model that includes a biological mechanism known as negative selection ( see below ) .",
    "the brb paper @xcite appeared in a biological context ( with lots of immunological detail not easily accessible to the non - specialist ) and therefore put little emphasis on mathematical detail .",
    "the aim of the present article is threefold .",
    "firstly , we will make this fascinating piece of theoretical biology available to a more mathematical readership . to this end",
    ", we will streamline the modelling by formulating a set of explicit assumptions .",
    "secondly , we will put the analysis on a solid mathematical basis by stating and applying the necessary large deviation result .",
    "this result holds under rather general conditions and therefore opens up interesting perspectives for further research .",
    "thirdly , we will put forward and analyse numerically an extension of the brb - model obtained by replacing the constant copy numbers of antigens on apcs by random variables , which is biologically more realistic .    the remainder of this article ( which builds on the thesis of zint @xcite , where many more details may be found ) is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ s : biology ] explains the immunological problem in a nutshell .",
    "section  [ s : model ] presents the mathematical model in its generalized form , with the emphasis on making individual modelling steps and assumptions transparent .",
    "section [ s : ld ] is devoted to large deviations , and provides the main theorem required for our analysis .",
    "on this basis , approximations are derived in section [ s : activation_curves ] , and applied to the biological model to demonstrate its recognition ability .",
    "section [ s : discussion ] , finally , summarizes and discusses the results , the possible extensions , as well as the limitations of the model .",
    "the object of immunobiology is the body s own defence against pathogens like bacteria , viruses or fungi .",
    "one distinguishes between unspecific and specific defence mechanisms .",
    "the latter form the so - called immune system , which specifically reacts to intruders . in this reaction , the t - cells play an important role , which we will now briefly describe ; for more details , see the textbook by janeway et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "_ t - cells .",
    "_ t - cells are produced in the bone marrow and subsequently migrate to the thymus , where they mature ( see below ) .",
    "on leaving the thymus , each t - cell is characterized by a specific type of t - cell receptor ( tcr ) , which is displayed in many _",
    "identical _ copies on the surface of the particular t - cell ( see fig .  [",
    "f : illustration ] ) .",
    "these tcrs play an important part in the recognition of intruders ( see below ) .",
    "it is important to note that all tcrs on one t - cell are of the same type .",
    "however , a large number ( roughly @xmath0 ; see arstila et al .",
    "@xcite ) of different receptors , and hence different t - cell types , are present in an individual .",
    "_ antigen - presenting cells .",
    "_ the partners of the t - cells are the antigen - presenting cells ( apcs ) , each producing so - called mhc molecules of different types ( the set of these different types is the same for all the apcs of a given individual ) .",
    "an apc absorbs antigens from its vicinity and breaks them down . in the cell",
    "the emerging fragments , so - called peptides ( short sequences of amino acids ) , are bound to the mhc molecules .",
    "the resulting complexes , composed of an mhc molecule and a peptide ( abbreviated by pmhc ) , are displayed on the surface of the cell ( the mhc molecules serve as `` carriers '' or `` anchors '' to the cell surface ) .",
    "since most of the peptides in the vicinity of an apc are the body s own peptides , every apc displays a large variety of different types of self - peptides and , possibly , one ( or a small number of ) foreign types .",
    "the various types of peptides occur in various copy numbers , as will be detailed below . for the moment",
    ", we merely note that foreign peptides are often present at elevated copy numbers .",
    "as noted above , this is because pathogens multiply within the body and flood it with their antigens , before an immune response is initiated .",
    "_ interactions between t - cells and apcs._[ss : reactions ] the presentation of peptides on the surface of the apcs is of great importance for the immune system , because t - cells will only be activated when they recognize foreign peptides on the surface of an apc .",
    "the contact between a t - cell and an apc is established by a temporary bond between the cells , through which a so - called immunological synapse ( see fig .  [",
    "f : synapse ] ) is formed , in which the tcrs and the pmhcs interact with each other . if a t - cell recognizes a foreign peptide through its receptors , then it is activated to reproduce , and the resulting clones of t - cells will initiate an immune reaction against the intruder .    0.3truecm    _ maturation .",
    "_ during the maturation of a t - cell , several processes take place in the thymus .",
    "initially , the t - cell starts to display the tcrs on its surface .",
    "after this , two selective processes take place . during positive selection , those t - cells that hardly interact with the mhc molecules of the individual are removed .",
    "furthermore , negative selection causes the removal of those t - cells that react too strongly to self - peptides .",
    "thus , both useless and dangerous t - cells are removed .",
    "_ problem .",
    "_ self - peptides and foreign peptides can not differ from each other by nature .",
    "after all , even tissues of a different individual of the same species are recognized as foreign ( this is the basic problem of transplantation ) .",
    "however , the activation of a t - cell occurs only when it recognizes a foreign peptide .",
    "therefore the question comes up how the t - cells can distinguish between self and non - self . at first sight ,",
    "the task seems hopeless , since there are vastly more different peptides ( roughly @xmath1 ; see mason @xcite ) than tcrs ( roughly @xmath0 , as noted earlier ) , which makes specific recognition ( where one tcr recognizes exactly one pmhc ) impossible ; this is known as the mason paradox .",
    "fortunately , there is an answer to this question .",
    "we present here a slightly generalized version of the model originally proposed in brb @xcite . to this end , we recapitulate the modelling ideas and idealizations , and summarize them as assumptions ( a1)(a7 ) below .",
    "consider the immunological synapse between a t - cell and an apc ( see fig .",
    "[ f : synapse ] ) .",
    "the activation of the t - cell is conceived as follows .",
    "if a contact between a tcr and a pmhc lasts longer than a certain time period , @xmath2 , then the t - cell will receive a stimulus .",
    "the t - cell adds up the stimulation rates of all its receptors .",
    "if this sum exceeds a threshold , @xmath3 , then the t - cell will be activated .",
    "this model relies on several hypotheses , which are known as kinetic proofreading ( @xcite,@xcite ) , serial triggering ( @xcite,@xcite ) and counting of stimulated tcrs ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath4 be an unbound tcr of type @xmath5 , @xmath6 an unbound pmhc of type @xmath7 , and @xmath8 a complex composed of @xmath4 and @xmath6 , where @xmath9 .",
    "for every such pair , the binding and unbinding may , in chemical shorthand notation , be symbolized as @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the association and dissociation rates , respectively .",
    "an encounter ( to be used synonymously with an immunological synapse ) between a t - cell and an apc with its mixture of pmhcs is therefore characterized by the type @xmath5 of the t - cell , the types @xmath7 of pmhcs at hand and the associated surface densities @xmath13 , as well as the rates @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( which will be considered fixed for the purpose of this subsection ) .",
    "if the spatial structure in the immunological synapse is ignored , then the corresponding kinetics in the synapse is described by the deterministic law of mass action , i.e. , for the given @xmath5 , @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the surface densities of @xmath4 , @xmath6 and @xmath8 , respectively , at time @xmath18 ( and we note that only finitely many @xmath13 s are non - zero ) .",
    "it is easily verified that the solution of ( [ g : dgl ] ) , for the given @xmath5 , satisfies the conservation laws @xmath19    note that this deterministic approach , with its surface densities varying over the reals rather than a finite set , is justified when the numbers of all the involved molecules are large enough ( see e.g.  ethier and kurtz ( * ? ? ? * chapter 11 , theorem 2.1 ) ) .",
    "this standard approach to reaction kinetics is also used for the binding kinetics in the immunological synapse ( see e.g.  brb ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  ( a.5 ) ) , which describes the equilibrium of this model )",
    ". it should be noted , however , that some of the antigen types may be fairly rare in the situation at hand , so that the deterministic approach may be somewhat crude .",
    "but it will become clear later on that we actually do not depend on details of the binding kinetics .",
    "[ remark : in the probabilistic approach in the next subsection , we will use the symbol @xmath13 for the copy number of type @xmath7 pmhc rather than its surface density , since they differ by an ( irrelevant ) normalization factor only . ]    _ equilibrium . _",
    "the bond between a tcr and a pmhc consists of two parts : contacts between the tcr and the mhc molecule , and contacts between the tcr and the peptide . according to wu et al .",
    "@xcite , the former specify mainly the association rate and the latter mainly the dissociation rate .",
    "we consider mature t - cells , which implies that they have been positively selected , i.e. , each t - cell binds one type of the mhc molecules of the individual very well .",
    "thus , we idealize @xmath11 as very large ( @xmath20 ) for pmhcs containing this type of mhc molecule , and zero otherwise . for every @xmath5 , we therefore restrict @xmath7 in ( [ g : dgl ] ) to the set @xmath21 since only these pmhcs contribute significantly to the stimulation rate . as a consequence",
    ", we may assume that the reaction is in equilibrium , because this is reached on a time scale that is short relative to the time scale of activation .",
    "therefore , in view of ( [ g : dgl ] ) , for every @xmath5 we have @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote the equilibrium quantities . combining ( [ g : con_law ] ) for these quantities with ( [ g : equi ] ) , we get an equation for @xmath25 that can be solved to give the implicit system of equations @xmath26 ( cf .  brb ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix a.1 ) ) . assuming further that the concentration of tcrs is not limiting ( i.e. , @xmath27  this is the so - called serial triggering regime ) and that the relevant dissociation rates are very small ( i.e. , @xmath28 for all @xmath29 ) , we are led to the idealization    * @xmath30    as will become clear later on , this assumption may actually be relaxed ( see section [ s : discussion ] ) ; we make it here for ease of exposition",
    ".    _ stimulation rate . _ a given @xmath8 dissociates at rate @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , @xmath31 , the duration of a contact between @xmath4 and @xmath6 , is exponentially distributed with mean @xmath32 .",
    "hence , the probability of @xmath31 exceeding @xmath2 is @xmath33 , which we refer to as the _ stimulation probability _ ( of a @xmath8 ) .",
    "note that , by the above together with ( [ e : restriction ] ) and ( a1 ) , an encounter between a t - cell and an apc is now characterized by @xmath5 , @xmath34 as well as the collections of @xmath13 and @xmath35 for all @xmath29 with @xmath36 .",
    "the t - cell receives a stimulus every time a complex dissociates that has existed for at least time @xmath2 .",

    "if @xmath42 , then the complex will typically dissociate before stimulation .",
    "if @xmath43 , then the tcr and the pmhc will typically be associated for a long time . therefore the t - cell will get a stimulus through practically every binding event , but the pmhc keeps the receptor occupied for a long time , so only few stimuli are expected per time unit .    by ( a1 ) and",
    "( a2 ) , we finally get the total stimulation rate for a conjunction of a t - cell of type @xmath5 and a particular apc :    * @xmath44      so far , @xmath34 , @xmath13 and @xmath35 are considered to be given quantities for all @xmath45 .",
    "indeed , @xmath13 and @xmath35 may be determined experimentally for a given @xmath5 , @xmath7 pair ( cf .",
    "@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "however , owing to the diversity of complexes @xmath46 and mixtures of peptides presented on the apcs , it is not possible to specify all these quantities individually . therefore , in order to derive the overall probability of t - cell activation , a probabilistic approach is required .",

    "_ the genes of an organism can be classified as constitutive ones and inducible ones .",
    "the former encode proteins that are always present in every cell ( e.g.   proteins of the basic metabolism ) .",
    "in contrast , the latter encode proteins that only exist in some cells ( like for example muscle proteins ) and/or occur only temporarily , i.e. , they are variable . accordingly , the types of self - peptides on each apc may be partitioned into constitutive and variable , i.e. , @xmath47 , where @xmath48 , and we suppose that :    * there are constant numbers @xmath49 and @xmath50 of constitutive and variable types of peptides , respectively , on each apc .",
    "the constitutive types ( @xmath51 ) are the same on each apc , whereas there is a different sample of variable types ( @xmath52 ) on each apc . as a generalization of brb @xcite and zint @xcite",

    "therefore we suppose that :    * the @xmath13 are realizations of random variables denoted by @xmath53",

    "let us now add in foreign peptides , and make the simplifying assumption that only one type of foreign peptide is present on an apc , in @xmath56 copies .",
    "in the following , the index set for the pmhcs is therefore the union of @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the total stimulation rate with respect to a conjunction of a t - cell of type @xmath5 and a randomly chosen apc is given by @xmath59 here , the factor @xmath60 ensures that adding the foreign peptides does not change the expected number @xmath61 of mhc molecules on the surface of an apc , since also @xmath62 .    _ probability of activation .",

    "in particular , this assumption means that no distinction between foreign and self is built into the interaction between receptors and antigens .",
    "this reflects the fact that there is no a - priori difference between the peptides .",
    "note that ( a6 ) also implies that the @xmath34 need not be specified and the index @xmath5 may be suppressed , because we consider an arbitrary t - cell and the @xmath65 are i.i.d .  random variables .",
    "biologically , this means that we choose a new t - cell type ( as well as a new apc ) for each encounter , and ignore further meetings of t - cells of the same type . as a consequence ,",
    "the partitioning into constitutive and variable peptides has , at this stage , no effect except for the different abundances .",
    "altogether the total stimulation rate with respect to a conjunction of a randomly chosen t - cell and an apc is given by @xmath66 where @xmath67 , and :    * the probability of t - cell activation is @xmath68 .    _ specification of distributions and parameter values .",

    "the number of mhc molecules ranges between @xmath73 and @xmath74",
    ". therefore we take @xmath75 .",
    "furthermore , we use binomial distributions @xmath76 and @xmath77 for @xmath54 and @xmath55 , for all @xmath7 , with parameters @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , so that the means @xmath81 and @xmath82 correspond to the values @xmath83 and @xmath84 in the brb - model .",
    "( apart from the expectation , the distribution is an ad - hoc choice . )",
    "it should be mentioned that moderate changes of the values of the parameters ( like for example @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 ) do not qualitatively alter the results . furthermore , these values have been chosen on the grounds of experimental data ( see brb @xcite and zint @xcite ) .",
    "the exponential distribution is less - well founded . to show that the qualitative behavior does not rely on this particular distribution , we will , as an alternative , use the log - normal distribution ( with parameters @xmath87 and @xmath88 ) in section  [ s : actneg ] .",
    "this has a justification in terms of binding / unbinding kinetics ( see brb @xcite and zint @xcite ) .",
    "for the immune system to work , two conditions are essential : ( a ) if a foreign antigen is present , then at least one t - cell will be activated ; ( b ) there will be no activation when only self - antigens are present .",
    "it is helpful to recast this into a hypothesis testing framework , in the following way .",
    "the immune system performs a test of the null hypothesis @xmath89 against the alternative hypothesis @xmath90 the test is performed via @xmath91 independent encounters between a t - cell and an apc .",
    "@xmath92 is then rejected ( and @xmath93 assumed ) if at least one encounter leads to the event @xmath94 ; otherwise , @xmath92 is retained .",
    "the type i error is therefore @xmath95 and the type ii error is @xmath96 here , the underlying assumptions are ( a1)(a7 ) , and @xmath97 is the sum of random variables introduced in equation , with constants @xmath49 , @xmath50 and parameter @xmath56 . in particular , @xmath98 denotes the total stimulation rate in the absence of foreign peptides .",
    "the parameter @xmath3 can be fine - tuned by the cell ; for more on activation threshold tuning , see van den berg and rand @xcite .    clearly , @xmath99 is the probability of an autoimmune response , whereas @xmath100 is the probability that a foreign antigen goes unnoticed . by ( b ) and",
    "( a ) above , both @xmath99 and @xmath100 must be small for the self - nonself distinction to work .",
    "both @xmath101 and @xmath102 are rare events ( since at most a tiny fraction of the t - cells reacts to a given apc ) .",

    "we have no good knowledge of the value of @xmath91 ( except that it is bounded above by the number of t - cell types ) .",
    "but it is clear that a necessary condition for distinction is that @xmath3 can be chosen in such a way that , for physiologically realistic values of @xmath56 ,    * @xmath105    consequently , there is a region of intermediate values of @xmath91 for which both @xmath99 and @xmath100 are small .",

    "( note that the threshold @xmath3 is not known ; but we do know that reactions of t - cells are rare events .",

    "let us consider the activation curve for two extreme cases , namely , the self - background ( @xmath204 ) , and a very large number of foreign peptides ( @xmath205 ) . fig .",
    "[ f : comparison ] shows the simulated curve in comparison to the normal approximation and the approximation in ( [ g : akt_w ] ) . as was to be expected",
    ", the normal approximation describes the central part well , whereas for the right tail ( the relevant part of the distribution for the problem at hand ) the large deviation approximation is appropriate . for @xmath204 ,",
    "the latter describes the simulated distribution in an excellent way ; for @xmath205 , it still gives correct approximations beyond @xmath206 , which is the region we are interested in ( see the next subsection ) .",
    "an improved approximation of the entire curve is obtained in brb @xcite by combining the normal and the large deviation approximations , applying them to the self - peptides only , and performing a convolution with the single foreign one .",
    "we prefer the direct approach ( [ g : akt_w ] ) here , because it makes the large deviation aspect more transparent , and because it generalizes easily to situations with more than one foreign peptide .",
    "in fact , rather than taking the limit in the way described above , we could as well consider a sequence of models with @xmath207 different foreign peptides and let @xmath208 such that @xmath209 , @xmath210 and @xmath211 each tend to a constant ; the approximation of our given finite system by ( [ e : theta])-([g : akt_w ] ) would remain unchanged .",
    "+      as we have seen in the last subsection , the approximation in ( [ g : akt_w ] ) is suitable for the calculation of the activation curves for various values of @xmath56 .",
    "[ f : akt_without_sel ] shows the curves as a function of @xmath3 for exponentially ( a ) and log - normally ( b ) distributed @xmath63 . the results in ( a ) and ( b ) are qualitatively the same .",
    "namely , we observe that the curves for @xmath212 and @xmath213 ( both @xmath214 ) do not differ visibly from the curve for the self - background ; but , for @xmath215 and @xmath216 , condition ( c1 ) is fulfilled",
    ". therefore the model can indeed explain how t - cells are able to distinguish between self and non - self .",
    "comparison with fig .",
    "@xmath217 of brb @xcite shows that the separation of the activation curves is indeed similar to that in the original model . in terms of the cartoon in fig .",
    "[ f : illustration ] , the threshold value @xmath3 can be chosen so that t - cell 2 will be activated when it encounters apc 2 with three foreign peptides ( the circles ) , while the other apcs without foreign peptides ( the non - circles ) will not activate any t - cell .",
    "the intuitive reason behind the self versus non - self distinction is an elevated number of presented foreign peptides in comparison with the copy numbers of individual types of self - peptides .",
    "indeed , this increases the variability of @xmath218 ( which is reminiscent of the fact that for @xmath219 i.i.d .",
    "random variables with positive variance , @xmath220 has a larger variance than @xmath221 ) .",
    "so far the number of presented foreign peptides has to be fairly large : at least as large as the copy number of constitutive ones , which are , in turn , more abundant than the variable ones ( one might actually reformulate the hypotheses pair and so as to test whether the foreign antigen is more abundant than the constitutive peptides or not ) .",
    "however , this restriction vanishes when we take the training phase of the young t - cells into account , as will be done in the next subsection .      in order to model the process called _ negative selection _ ( see jiang and chess @xcite for a recent review of the biological details ) ,",
    "one postulates a second threshold @xmath222 with a similar role as @xmath3 . if the stimulation rate of a young t - cell in its maturation phase in the thymus ( where the apcs only present self - peptides ) exceeds this threshold , then the t - cell is induced to die . for",
    "a caricature version of this process , let us assume that t - cell types present in the thymus exist in one copy each and encounter exactly one apc there .",
    "the model then consists of two parts : first , the maturation phase is modelled to characterize the t - cell repertoire surviving negative selection ; second , activation curves are calculated for this surviving repertoire . in the first step , we have to calculate the probability to survive negative selection conditional on the type of the t - cell : @xmath223 in this case the conceptual difference between @xmath51 and @xmath52 has an effect , which is essential .",
    "the constitutive types of peptides are the same on each apc , both in the thymus and in the rest of the body .",
    "only these can be `` learnt '' as self by negative selection ",
    "the @xmath52 , being a fresh sample for every apc , are entirely unpredictable .",
    "therefore we have @xmath224 , the constitutive part of the stimulation rate reads @xmath225 , which is _ constant _ for fixed @xmath5 .",
    "therefore we have @xmath226 this simplifies the second step , the calculation of the activation curves conditional on survival : only a single integration step is required .",
    "numerically , it turns out that ( c1 ) is already fulfilled for @xmath227 ( @xmath228 ) .",
    "actually , the detection threshold for foreign antigens is reduced drastically ( to about a third of the original value ) .    in our case ( where the copy numbers vary from apc to apc ) , @xmath229 , the constitutive part , varies from encounter to encounter .",
    "indeed , whereas the @xmath230 are fixed for each t - cell , the copy numbers are tied to the apcs .",
    "therefore @xmath231 is not sufficient to determine @xmath232 , and hence the survival probability ; rather , the entire collection of the individual stimulation rates @xmath230 for the constitutive types must be known to calculate the probability of the young t - cell to survive negative selection .",
    "the corresponding convolution required in the second step involves high - dimensional integrals , which appear to be computationally infeasible . in van den berg and molina - paris @xcite this difficulty",
    "is tackled by simplifying the distribution of @xmath233 to a bernoulli variable . here",
    "we resort to simulations .    to this end",
    ", we assume that each mature t - cell encounters the same number ( in our simulation @xmath104 ) of apcs in the rest of the body . for @xmath234 ( which for our choice of parameters corresponds to thymic deletion of about @xmath235 of the young t - cells ) the activation curves",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ f : akt_with_sel ] . as in the case of fixed copy numbers ,",
    "we observe an incipient separation of the activation curves for @xmath204 and @xmath213 .",
    "all in all , the above shows that the reduced detection threshold for foreign antigens occurs in the case of random copy numbers too .",
    "however , it seems that the separation of the activation curves is less pronounced here than in the case of constant copy numbers .",
    "this is plausible because the copy numbers of several constitutive peptides could be large ( comparable to the copy number of the foreign peptide ) and therefore the recognition does not work equally well .",
    "more pronounced separation of the curves could be achieved by including mechanisms of so - called peripheral tolerance into the model .",
    "these mechanisms control the immune response of t - cells once they have left the thymus ( mainly by the action of t - suppressor cells ) ; see @xcite for review and @xcite for modelling approaches .",
    "we have analysed mathematically how t - cells can use large deviations to recognize foreign antigens .",
    "before we discuss details of our results , let us pause here to discuss the notion of recognition that emerges from this analysis .    as explained in the introduction ,",
    "the task the immune system faces is to recognize foreign antigens against a background of self - molecules . in much of the biological literature ( and in line with intuitive understanding ) , this recognition is implied to be specific on a molecular basis . in sharp contrast , the mechanism proposed by brb @xcite , and further analysed here , dispenses with such a high degree of strict specificity and , instead , is based on elevated copy numbers of the foreign antigen , relative to the self - background .",
    "this alleviates the mason paradox about the repertoire size versus the universe of potentially relevant peptides . in this sense ,",
    "specific recognition of antigen types is replaced by _ probabilistic recognition _",
    "( this concept also appears elsewhere in biology , for example in the olfactory system ; see , e.g. , lancet et al .",
    "we have examined this fact in detail for the situation without negative selection , where the principle becomes most transparent and can be largely dealt with via a large deviation analysis .",
    "negative selection basically lowers the relevant background stimulation rate .",
    "therefore it is easier for the foreign peptide to stand out against it , but the basic principle of recognition on the basis of frequencies remains the same .",
    "the generalization we have examined in this article concerns precisely this fundamental issue of frequencies . in the original brb - model @xcite",
    ", these frequencies were considered fixed ( within the variable and constitutive class ) . in a subsequent paper , @xcite , a more sophisticated model of copy number variability",
    "was introduced ( to reflect the fact that different cell types produce different proteins in different amounts , and some specialized cells may even produce large amounts of a variable peptide ) .",
    "we have replaced this here by a simpler approach that makes the analysis more amenable .    at the same time , allowing the @xmath53 to vary allows us to weaken assumption ( a1 ) , which is somewhat too restrictive in that it assumes that , for all @xmath236 , all pmhcs are in the perfectly bound state .",
    "but if we simply reinterpret @xmath53 as the ( fluctuating ) number of _ bound _ antigens rather than the total number ( i.e. , corresponding to @xmath237 rather than to @xmath13 ) , then we can circumvent ( a1 ) and , at the same time , free ourselves from the details and limitations of the deterministic binding kinetics , the assumptions of which may sometimes be violated , for example , if copy numbers are low .",
    "although , in this vein , a detailed model of the binding kinetics may not be required , one last remark is in order concerning a potential _",
    "stochastic _ model .",
    "stochastic models of binding kinetics , e.g.  as described in ethier and kurtz ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter @xmath238 ) , take care of the finite number of molecules , and of the resulting fluctuations of bound molecules over the short time scales of the binding kinetics . over the longer time",
    "scales to be considered for our averaged stimulation rates , the corresponding time averages would be relevant . in particular , these would in general not be integers ; in this light , the factor @xmath239 , which turns the multipliers of the sums in ( [ g : zv_trigger_fremd ] ) into non - integer values , is rendered plausible .    summarizing ,",
    "our results show that the _ probabilistic _",
    "recognition phenomenon is astonishingly robust against fluctuations of the copy numbers .",
    "similarly , generalizations in various other directions that take into account many more biological details ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , have shown that the phenomenon persists in a robust way .",
    "one may therefore hope that several details of the assumptions may actually be dispensed with .",
    "future work will thus aim at identifying the joint mathematical content of the underlying family of models .",
    "in particular , this will include an analysis of what aspects of the distribution of the @xmath233 s are key to the observed phenomenon .",
    "luckily , the scope of the large deviation result theorem [ t : verall_b_r ] is wide enough to cope with very general situations .",
    "in particular , one is not bound to sums of independent random variables , but can also tackle dependencies ( like , for example , those introduced by negative selection ) within the present framework .",
    "furthermore , the large deviation framework may also be used to construct efficient simulation methods for the tail events , as will be described in a forthcoming paper ( f.  lipsmeier & e.  baake , in preparation ) .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank hugo van den berg for explaining the details of the brb - model and providing helpful comments on the manuscript , and michael baake for extensive discussions .",
