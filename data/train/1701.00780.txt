    "the explanation of the late - time accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite has become one of the biggest and open problems in modern cosmology today .",
    "the most reasonable description for this accelerating phase introduces some hypothetical dark energy ( de ) fluid comprising about 70% of the total energy density of the universe @xcite .",
    "the cosmological constant , @xmath1 , associated with the zero point energy of the quantum fields , is the main candidate for de in agreement with a large number of available observational data .",
    "however , despite of great success of @xmath1-cosmology , it presents serious objections in the interface of cosmology and particle physics , such as the cosmological constant problem @xcite and the coincidence problem @xcite . due to these two serous problems in @xmath1 ,",
    "several alternatives have been proposed and discussed in the last several years @xcite .",
    "however , concerning different cosmological theories , the scenario where dark matter ( dm ) interacts with dark energy ( de ) has gained much attention in the current literature .",
    "the interaction between dm and de were primarily motivated to address the small value of the cosmological constant , however later on the models were found to provide a reasonable explanation to the cosmic coincidence problem @xcite .",
    "recently it has been argued that the current observational data can favor the late - time interaction between dm and de @xcite .",
    "the coupling parameter of the interaction in the dark sector has also been measured by several observational data @xcite .",
    "in fact , the class of interacting dm @xmath2 de models could be a promising candidate to resolve the current tensions on @xmath3 and the local value of the hubble constant @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "further , it has been contended that the interaction between these dark sectors can influence on the perturbation analysis which results in significant changes in the lowest multipoles of the cmb spectrum @xcite .",
    "for a comprehensive analysis on several interacting models explored in the last couple of years we refer @xcite .",
    "therefore , based on the analysis on interacting dark energy models with a special indication for a nonzero interaction between the dark sectors from the the currently available observational data , it seems promising that the interaction in the dark sectors might open some new possibilities in near future .",
    "the interacting dynamics proposes for continuous energy and/or momentum exchange between dm and de with the evolution of the universe and modifies the conservation equations for dm ( @xmath5 @xmath6 ) and de ( @xmath5 @xmath7 ) as @xmath8 where the function @xmath9 characterizes the interaction between the dark sectors in which @xmath10 represents the energy and/or momentum flow from de to dm while @xmath11 means energy and/or momentum flow takes place from dm to de .",
    "thus , essentially , we choose different functional forms for @xmath9 ( with correct physical dimension ) and we solve the corresponding evolution equations .",
    "the procedure followed is similar to that when one chooses different parametrizations for the eos in de .",
    "few developments can be found in the literature where the complete dynamics of the interacting model has been explored @xcite . another approach to consider the interaction between two fluids is for instance the sigma models @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we determine the complete dynamics of an interacting scenario where de interacts with pressureless dm through a nongravitational interaction considered in @xcite and we generalize its observational consequences considering that the de component is barotropic and its eos could be either constant or time dependent .",
    "we first consider the constant equation of state in dark energy and show that the background evolution can be analytically solved which we constrain using the combined analysis from type ia supernovae , hubble data , and baryon acoustic oscillation data .",
    "then we apply the same combined analysis of the above observational data to the case when the eos in de is evolving with the cosmic time .",
    "the work has been organized in the following way : section [ ide - flrw ] presents a brief introduction of the interacting dynamics in a spatially flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe . in section [ sec - analytic ]",
    ", we present the analytic solutions for dark energy and cold dark matter for constant equation of state @xmath12 @xmath13 and when the dark energy is the cosmological constant while additionally , in subsection [ sec : asymptotic ] , we perform an asymptotic analysis of the analytic solutions , and then we discussed about the possible sign of the interaction . in section [ sec - variable - de ] we introduce dynamical de models interacting with cdm .",
    "section [ data - analysis ] contains all the data analysis tools we used in this study .",
    "in the next section [ results ] we present the observational constraints on the interacting models and the main results of the paper . finally , we close our work in section [ discu ] with summary and discussions .",
    "observations from cosmic microwave background radiation and large scale structure predict in good approximation that our universe is homogeneous and isotropic in the largest scale , and further it is almost spatially flat @xcite .",
    "this line element describing such a universe is known as the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker line element , which takes the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the scale factor of the universe , @xmath16 being the universal cosmic time .",
    "further , this homogeneous and isotropic principle gives a restriction on the matter distribution of our universe .",
    "it tells that the matter distribution should be of perfect fluid type which takes its energy momentum tensor as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , respectively denote the energy density and the pressure of the cosmic fluid , and @xmath20 is the four velocity vector of the fluid components . for our model",
    ", we consider the general relativity described by the einstein s field equations @xmath21 , and two fluids as follows : + @xmath22 pressureless dark matter ( or dust ) where @xmath23 is its energy density and @xmath24 , is its pressure .",
    "+ @xmath22 a dark energy fluid satisfying a barotropic equation of state @xmath25 , where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , are respectively the energy density and the pressure of the component , @xmath12 is its equation of state .",
    "+ thus , for a co - moving observer ( @xmath28 ) , the einstein s field equations are explicitly written as ( considering @xmath29 ) @xmath30 where @xmath31 , is the hubble parameter .",
    "further , the conservation equations for dm and de follows from eqn .",
    "( [ eqn1 ] ) @xmath32 clearly , equations ( [ conservation1 ] ) and ( [ conservation2 ] ) offer a new dynamics of the universe with the use of the interaction function @xmath9 .",
    "there are many proposed interactions in the literature to study the dynamics of the universe , however , the exact functional form of @xmath9 is still unknown . from the coupled continuity equations ( [ conservation1 ] ) and ( [ conservation2 ] )",
    ", we observe that @xmath9 could be any arbitrary function of the parameters @xmath33 , @xmath23 , @xmath26 .",
    "so , naturally , one can construct infinitely many interacting models to understand the dynamics of the universe in this framework . in the present work , we start with the following interaction @xcite : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the coupling parameter which is dimensionless , and the `  @xmath36  ' denotes the differentiation with respect to @xmath37 ( @xmath38 is the present value of the scale factor which has been set to be unity in this work , i.e. @xmath39 ) .",
    "in fact , if one uses the conservation equations ( [ conservation1 ] ) , and ( [ conservation2 ] ) , it will be readily clear that the interaction ( [ interaction ] ) has the following equivalent form @xmath40 which directly includes the equation of state parameter of the dark energy component , that means the pressure of the dark energy component .",
    "however , inserting ( [ interaction ] ) into the conservation equations ( [ conservation1 ] ) and ( [ conservation2 ] ) , we decouple the conservation equations as @xmath41 where both equations ( [ conservation1.1 ] ) and ( [ conservation2.1 ] ) seem to describe an effective non - interacting two fluid system , and due to the interaction , the effective eos for pressureless dm ( @xmath42 ) , de ( @xmath43 ) take the forms @xmath44 and @xmath45 where @xmath46 , is the coincidence parameter .",
    "now , from ( [ cdm - eff ] ) , ( [ de - eff ] ) , we note that , even if the eos in dm and de are constant , but due to the interaction between them , the effective eos of the two components become variable in nature .",
    "now , if we denote the total eos for the non - interacting dm - de system by @xmath47 ( as dm is pressureless , i.e. @xmath48 ) , then the effective eos : @xmath49 , of the same system due to this interaction becomes @xmath50 equations ( [ cdm - eff ] ) , ( [ de - eff ] ) lead to the following interesting possibilities we will discuss now .",
    "+ @xmath22 if @xmath10 , eq .",
    "( [ cdm - eff ] ) implies that , @xmath51 meaning that the effective equation of state of the pressureless dark matter is of exotic type , and it could become a dark energy candidate ( eos @xmath52 ) if @xmath53 . on the other hand , the effective equation of state for dark energy satisfies the following inequality : @xmath54 , which shows that if the eos in dark energy satisfies the relation @xmath55 , then the effective interactive system is of course in the quintessence era ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "however , if the dark energy is of phantom kind , then the above inequality could still hold , but in this case , the effective eos in dark energy may lie in the phantom / quintessence region depending on the strength of the interaction .",
    "@xmath22 if @xmath57 , then @xmath58 irrespective of anything .",
    "in case of effective dark energy , we find that @xmath59 which readily points that , for @xmath60 , the effective equation of state is always phantom in nature . on the other hand , for @xmath61",
    ", @xmath62 could cross the phantom barrier line ` @xmath0 ' due to the presence of @xmath63 in ( [ de - eff ] ) .",
    "but , the possibility of quintessence behavior ca nt be excluded as again we do not specify the strength of the interaction .",
    "however , introducing the total energy density of the universe , @xmath64 , we can express the dark energy and the dark matter density in terms of the total energy density and its derivative as @xmath65 now , inserting ( [ de - density ] ) into ( [ conservation2.1 ] ) , we obtain the following second order differential equation @xmath66\\rho^\\prime_t+ 9 \\left[(1+\\omega_d)-\\frac{\\omega^\\prime_d}{3\\omega_d}\\right]\\rho_t & =   0,\\label{ode1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which if we could solve might describe the possible dynamics of the universe . in what follows",
    ", we consider the evolution of the universe both for constant and dynamic eos in de .",
    "let us now consider the case when the eos in de is independent of time , we denote the eos by @xmath67 .",
    "this consideration reduces the differential equation ( [ ode1 ] ) into the following simplified format @xmath68\\rho^\\prime_t+ 9 ( 1+\\omega_{d})\\rho_t&= & 0,\\label{ode2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which solves for @xmath69 as @xmath70 where @xmath71 , @xmath72 are the constants of integration , and , @xmath73 are given by @xmath74,\\label{m1}\\nonumber \\\\ m_2&= & \\frac{3}{2}\\left[-(2+\\omega_{d}-\\alpha \\omega_{d})- \\sqrt{(1-\\alpha)^2 \\omega_{d}^2- 4 \\alpha \\omega_{d}}\\right],\\label{m2}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as @xmath75 , so , @xmath73 are real .",
    "the equation ( [ solution - constant - eos ] ) can be written as @xmath76 where @xmath77 , @xmath78 in which @xmath79 .",
    "it is interesting to note that , the solution ( [ f1 ] ) which represents the analytic behavior for two interacting fluids , has also been found in the context of two non - interacting fluids where one is brans - dicke scalar field and the other is the perfect fluid with constant equation of state @xcite .",
    "moreover , using ( [ de - density ] ) , ( [ dm - density ] ) , the explicit analytic expressions for de and dm density are    @xmath80\\label{de - constanta }   -\\frac{\\rho_1(m_1 + 3 ) ( 1+z)^{-m_1}+ \\rho_2(m_2 + 3 ) ( 1+z)^{-m_2}}{3 \\omega_d}\\label{de - constanta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and @xmath81.\\label{dm - constantb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] however , the constants @xmath71 , @xmath72 do not serve only as the constants of integrations , they have crucial meanings . in order to explain this ,",
    "let us introduce the density parameters for dark matter and dark energy as @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) , @xmath84 respectively , thus , the friedmann equation ( [ friedmann1 ] ) can be written as @xmath85 .",

    "however , we have used the suffix @xmath89 in @xmath12 to keep the same structure with the other parameters , for instance , @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , in the scenario of interacting de with constant eos , @xmath87 and @xmath12 should be considered to be idential . ] .",
    "now , dividing ( [ de - present ] ) and ( [ dm - present ] ) by @xmath79 , we get the present day density parameters for de and dm as follows : @xmath92,\\label{dedp}\\\\ \\omega_{m0 } & =   \\left(\\frac{1}{3 \\omega_{d0}}\\right)\\bigl[\\omega_1(m_1 + 3 + 3\\omega_{d0})+ \\omega_2(m_2 + 3 + 3\\omega_{d0})\\bigr],\\label{dmdp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , solving for @xmath93 and @xmath94 , we find @xmath95    @xmath22 * when de is the cosmological constant * + now , we consider the case when de is the cosmological constant .",
    "thus , in this case , we have @xmath96 , hence , @xmath73 take the forms @xmath97 .",
    "the total energy density takes the form @xmath98 and the explicit analytic solutions of the energy density for the cosmological constant and the energy density of the pressureless matter in this interacting picture take the expressions @xmath99 hence , the friedmann equation becomes @xmath100 where @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and the solution has also been found in the context of two non - interacting perfect fluids where one is the brans - dicke scalar field and the other is the perfect fluid ( in the form of dust ) ( paliathanasis , tsamparlis , basilakos , & barrow 2016 ) .",
    "further , we have the following relations : @xmath103 further , we can solve for @xmath104 and @xmath105 as @xmath106 it should be noted that , @xmath107 .",
