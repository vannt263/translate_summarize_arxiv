    "in recent years major advances have been made in the experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite investigation of the near threshold meson production reactions in nucleon - nucleon collisions ( for a comprehensive review cf .",
    "@xcite ) . with the advent of medium - energy accelerators ( icuf , celsius and cosy ) and the corresponding influx of high precision data on the total and differential cross section as well as the polarization observables , it has become possible to study the interaction of the flavor - neutral mesons ( eg . @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) with nucleons . a direct insight into such interaction can not be gained from meson - nucleon scattering experiments as the latter are impractical owing to the very short life time of these mesons .",
    "naturally , the largest data base has been accumulated for the pions @xcite but the bulk of data on @xmath2 production in proton - proton collisions has also expanded significantly @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 meson , which is the next lightest non - strange member of the pseudoscalar octet , has focused considerable attention of the nuclear community since it was established that the @xmath2-n interaction was quite strong and attractive which might lead to a possible existence of the @xmath2-nuclear bound states .    in the recent measurements of the @xmath0 reaction a very accurate determination of the four - momenta of both outgoing protons allowed for the full reconstruction of the kinematics of the final @xmath6 state . in consequence , these measurements provided in addition to the @xmath2 and the proton angular distributions , also the @xmath7 and @xmath8 effective mass distributions @xcite .",
    "the common feature of the near - threshold meson production in proton - proton collisions is the dominance of the very strong proton - proton final state interaction .",
    "the monte carlo simulations as well as direct calculations reveal that for small excess energies the inclusion of fsi enhances the cross section by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "this effect is also clearly visible in the effective mass distributions : as a prominent peak close to threshold in the pp effective mass distribution or as a bump near the end - point in the @xmath8 effective mass distribution .",
    "the description in terms of a simple model in which a constant @xmath2 production amplitude is multiplied by an on - shell proton - proton fsi enhancement factor is only qualitatively correct , but at a quantitative level turns out to be insufficient to explain the experimental pp and @xmath2p effective mass distributions .",
    "the contribution from higher partial waves and the final state @xmath2p interaction have been indicated as the possible sources of this discrepancy . in comparison with pp interaction , however , the role of @xmath2-n interaction is much less important and taking as a rough measure the ratio of the @xmath2p and pp scattering lengths squared we may expect an effect at the level of about 1% .",
    "a full three - body calculation based on the hyperspherical harmonics method accounting for all pair - wise final state interactions corroborates the above estimate showing that the @xmath2p interaction modifies significantly only the total @xmath2 production cross section as function of the excitation energy whereas the distortion of the shapes of the effective mass distributions does not exceed the current experimental uncertainties .",
    "the hyperspherical harmonics method will be presented elsewhere @xcite and here instead we would like to confine our attention to a purely phenomenological description of the effective mass spectra at the lowest available excitation energy equal q=15.5  mev . at such a low q only a few partial waves in both initial and final states are expected to participate in the @xmath2 creation process which substantially facilitates the interpretation of the experimental findings . among the possible amplitudes the partial wave amplitude in which the two protons are deposited in the @xmath1 state plays a dominant role because it is proportional to the large fsi enhancement factor .",
    "therefore , in the first approximation , in the cross section it should be sufficient to retain the square of the modulus of the dominant amplitude plus the interference terms that would contain the large fsi enhancement factor .",
    "however , after integrating over the angles the interference terms vanish and give no contribution to the pp effective mass distribution .",
    "this implies that there is really no room for improvements left unless a weak energy dependence is admitted in the dominant partial wave amplitude .",
    "we demonstrate in this paper that with this rather modest assumption both pp and @xmath2p effective mass distributions can be quite well reproduced .",
    "the plan of our presentation is as follows . in the next section",
    "the fsi enhancement factor is revisited .",
    "we argue that owing to a too steep a fall of the on - shell enhancement factor the approximate form thereof should be abandoned if favor of the full off - shell expression .",
    "having established the best form of the enhancement factor we discuss the partial wave expansion of the @xmath9 transition amplitude in a quest of an approximate expression for the cross section that would be valid for the lowest excitation energies .",
    "finally , in section iii we verify our simple model by presenting the comparison with experiment .",
    "since the proton - proton final - state interaction is believed to be the dominant ingredient in the description of the @xmath0 reaction close to threshold , it is logical that we first wish to reexamine the fsi problem to make sure that adequate measures have been taken to obtain the ultimate solution . the basic idea how to account for final state interaction was put forward 50 years ago by fermi @xcite , watson @xcite , migdal @xcite and others ( for a review cf .",
    "@xcite ) and is based on the observation that in many processes the interaction responsible for carrying the system from the initial to the final state is of such a short range that in the first approximation may be regarded as point like . as a prototype one may consider a meson ( x ) production reaction @xmath10 . to generate the meson mass m in nucleon - nucleon collision",
    "a large momentum transfer is required between the initial and the final nucleons , which is typically of the order @xmath11 , with @xmath12 being the nucleon mass .",
    "the corresponding  range  of the production interaction is therefore much shorter than the range of the interaction between the two final state nucleons .",
    "although it is perfectly true that the final state nn interaction significantly distorts the nn wave function but in the transition matrix element the contribution from all but the smallest nn separations will be strongly suppressed and the main effect may be attributed to the change of the normalization of the wave function at zero separation . if the non - interacting nn pair is described by a plane wave @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the relative nn momentum ( @xmath15 units are used hereafter ) , to account for final state interaction the latter must be replaced in the transition matrix element by the complete nn wave function @xmath16 satisfying outgoing spherical wave boundary condition at infinity . nevertheless , for a _ point - like interaction _ , we may set @xmath17 in the matrix element so that the final state interaction will be accounted for by multiplying the transition matrix element by the enhancement factor , defined as @xmath18 the factor @xmath19 that appears in the cross section represents the ratio of two probabilities : one of finding the interacting nn pair at zero separation , while the other probability is associated with non - interacting particles . by construction , when the final state interaction is turned off , the enhancement factor will be equal to unity . expanding both , the numerator and the denominator on the right hand side of in partial waves",
    ", we have @xmath20 where @xmath21 for small @xmath22 , @xmath23 is spherical bessel function and @xmath24 denotes legendre polynomial .",
    "clearly , in the limit @xmath25 in , all higher partial waves will be suppressed by the centrifugal barrier , and only the contribution the from s - wave survives .",
    "thus , we obtain a simple formula @xmath26 where prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath22 , and , as apparent from , the enhancement factor is determined by the slope of the wave function at the origin . to find this slope",
    "we must know the nn s - wave interaction and for simplicity we shall in the following assume that the latter takes the form of a spherically symmetric radial potential .",
    "the shape of this potential may be arbitrary but it must be of a short range . given the nn potential , we can integrate outward the appropriate wave equation , containing both the nuclear and the coulomb potential , generating numerically a regular solution @xmath27 ( i.e. vanishing at the origin ) whose derivative satisfies the boundary condition @xmath28 where @xmath2 denotes the sommerfeld parameter and @xmath29 $ ] is the coulomb barrier penetration factor .",
    "the sought for physical solution @xmath30 occurring in which is also regular , is necessarily proportional to @xmath27 , and , more explicitly , we have @xmath31\\;u_0(k , r ) .   \\label{c3}\\ ] ] now , all we need to calculate @xmath32 is the asymptotic expression for the physical wave function . for @xmath33 with r much bigger than the range of the nuclear potential , the physical wave function takes the form @xmath34\\,u_0(k , r)=\\\\             & = f_0(\\eta , kr)+f_0(k)\\,h^+_0(\\eta , kr),\\\\ \\label{c9 }          \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath37 being the standard coulomb wave functions defined in @xcite , and @xmath38 denotes the s - wave scattering amplitude with @xmath39 being the s - wave phase shift .",
    "the differentiation of with respect to r , provides us with a second condition for the derivatives but it should be noted that @xmath40 and @xmath41 occurring in these two matching conditions are to be regarded as known quantities .",
    "indeed , they are fully specified by the boundary condition at the origin and can be either calculated analytically , or obtained by numerical methods .",
    "therefore , what we end up with are two algebraic equations in which the two unknowns are the enhancement factor @xmath32 and the scattering amplitude @xmath42 and the respective solutions , can be conveniently written as @xmath43 } , \\label{c10}\\ ] ] and @xmath44 }                { w[h^+_0(\\eta , kr),u_0(k , r ) ] } ,   \\label{c10a}\\ ] ] where the symbol @xmath45 $ ] denotes the wronskian defined as @xmath45\\equiv fg'-f'g$ ] .",
    "we wish to recall that the specific wronskian involving the regular solution and the outgoing wave solution present in the denominator of and has been referred to as the jost function @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that unlike the scattering amplitude which can be expressed solely in terms of the logarithmic derivative of the regular solution , the enhancement factor depends separately upon both , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and therefore the calculation of @xmath32 requires off - shell information . in particular , a phase shift equivalent transformation of the potential may change the enhancement factor by orders of magnitude",
    ". formula may be cast to the form @xmath48},\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the familiar watson - migdal factor @xcite , depending solely upon the on - shell quantities , whereas the wronskian occurring in represents the off - shell correction .",
    "formula deserves some further comments .",
    "it is easy to check that when both , the coulomb and the strong interaction are switched off , the enhancement factor goes to unity .",
    "when the nuclear potential alone is set equal to zero , we have @xmath50 and yields @xmath51 . clearly , these are the right limits but they could not have been obtained with the watson - migdal factor alone which implies the importance of the off - shell correction .",
    "nevertheless , close to threshold the off - shell factor varies slowly with energy , and the watson - migdal factor usually makes a good approximation .",
    "it should be kept in mind , however , that in result of multiplying the cross section by the watson - migdal factor the overall normalization is lost precluding an absolute calculation .",
    "some authors choose to simplify further the watson - migdal enhancement factor by applying a coulomb modified effective range formula for the phase shift .",
    "thus , for the pp case , the phase shift can be obtained e.g. from the expression @xcite @xmath52 with @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the logarithmic derivative of the gamma function . in @xmath55 and @xmath56",
    "denote , respectively , the experimental pp scattering length and the effective range and the remaining two parameters ( @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) are related to a specific nn potential @xcite .",
    "the approximation has been popular in ceratin quarters and used in conjunction with watson - migdal formula for not very large k , results in a good approximation to the enhancement factor owing to a rather fortuitous cancellation of errors associated with different approximations .",
    "we are going now to illustrate the results obtained in the preceding subsection by explicit calculations carried out for three phenomenological nn potentials which are : the delta - shell @xmath59 , a gaussian @xmath60 , and the soft - core reid @xmath61 potential @xcite . among these three potentials",
    "only reid potential has a repulsive short - range component while the two remaining ones are purely attractive .",
    "the reason for selecting these particular shapes is that they exhibit different behavior in the close to the origin region : the delta - shell potential vanishes for small @xmath22 , while a gaussian potential shows maximum strength at @xmath62 , and , finally , the reid potential is singular at the origin , i.e. @xmath63 . our purpose is to examine how this very different off - shell behavior influences the enhancement factor properties .",
    "thus , as our first example we shall consider the delta - shell potential specified by a range @xmath64 and a dimensionless depth parameter @xmath65 , defined by the formula @xmath66 where the values of the parameters are @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "although this potential is not realistic , its main advantage lies in its simplicity : both the phase shift and the enhancement factor may be for this case obtained in an analytic form .",
    "a simple calculation gives the phase shift @xmath69 where @xmath70 , and , respectively , the enhancement factor @xmath71 it is apparent from that when the nuclear potential is switched off by setting @xmath65 equal to zero the enhancement factor reduces to the coulomb factor @xmath72 .",
    "the gaussian potential @xmath73 has also two parameters , the depth @xmath74 and the range @xmath64 , whose values are @xmath75 and @xmath76 and in this case the the solution of the wave equation will be obtained numerically .",
    "finally , we consider the fully realistic reid soft core - potential @xcite , given in the form of a superposition of three yukawa potentials , which also requires numerical treatment .    the results of our computations are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] .",
    "phase shift for different pp potentials . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] we show the calculated pp phase shift vs c.m . momentum as obtained from the different potentials .",
    "they are compared with the data and we can see that up to about 150  mev all models agree well with experiment . for bigger momenta",
    "the situation is less satisfactory , except for the reid potential whose performance is still very good .     vs. k for different pp potentials .",
    "the dot - dashed curve has been obtained form and . ]    clearly , among the considered potentials only the reid potential has a repulsive core and therefore is capable of reproducing the crossover from positve to negative values in the phase shift at 340  mev . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] we compare the enhancement factors calculated from formula for different potentials .",
    "we stipulated the normalization as to get in all cases the same height at the maximum .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] that very good agreement between different potential models results sustains for momenta up to about 150  mev indicating that , apart from normalization , different off - shell properties have little impact on the shape of the enhancement factor .",
    "this can be easily understood since close to threshold effective range approximation is usually adequate and all nn potentials are devised in such a way that they are capable of reproducing the experimentally determined effective range parameters . the main consequence of conducting a phase shift equivalent transformation is that the asymptotic wave function and its derivative acquire a common factor preserving thereby the shape of the enhancement factor",
    ". the differences appearing at larger momenta are not surprising as the different models do differ there also on - shell , as apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] . in particular , as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , the effective range formula makes a reliable approximation for k not bigger than about 80  mev . with the current high precision data ,",
    "however , this approximation is insufficient causing a too rapid fall - off of the enhancement factor . indeed , already for the excitation energy as low as q=15.5  mev and the maximal momentum @xmath77 , @xmath78 calculated from is by a factor of 2 smaller from @xmath79 obtained from , with both functions normalized to yield the same height at the peak . in consequence , with the on - shell approximation the relative momentum distribution in the @xmath0 reaction has a too rapid fall off .      since close to threshold only a small number partial waves contribute to the @xmath0 transition amplitude , it is feasible to expand them in terms of angular momentum .",
    "the transition amplitude is an operator in spin space that depends upon the three c.m .",
    "momenta which determine the kinematics of the reaction , namely the initial proton momentum @xmath80 , the relative momentum of the final state protons @xmath14 , and , finally the momentum of the eta relative to the pp pair @xmath81 ( other possible choices will be discussed later on ) .",
    "the quantum numbers associated with the initial state are : the angular momentum @xmath82 , the total spin @xmath83 and the total angular momentum j. in the final state , the angular momentum and the the total spin of the pp pair are denoted as @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively , and the relative motion of the eta is described by the angular momentum @xmath86 . among the above quantum numbers only j is conserved while the remaining quantum numbers are constrained by parity conservation and by the pauli principle . since the eta is a pseudoscalar meson , parity conservation requires that @xmath87 must be an odd number . a list of possible transitions consistent with the above restrictions involving the lowest angular momenta is presented in table [ table_states ] .    .",
    "[ table_states ] list of allowed transitions @xmath88 for the lowest partial waves in the reaction @xmath0 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     these transitions can be classified as even or odd according to the value of the angular momentum @xmath84 of the final state protons . in the transition matrix element",
    "the even ( odd ) partial wave amplitude will be multiplied by an appropriate projection operator which is symmetric ( antisymmetric ) under the transformation @xmath89 . since",
    "the final state protons are indistinguishable all observables must be invariant under the interchange of the proton momenta , i.e. under the @xmath89 transformation .",
    "this means that all interference terms between even and odd states which are antisymmetric under @xmath89 transformation are bound to vanish if one wants to respect pauli principle . in consequence",
    ", interference is allowed only between partial waves belonging to the same group which significantly reduces the number of terms in the cross section .    for small excitation energy the final state pp interaction appears to be the dominant effect and",
    "therefore it seems justified to neglect in the cross section all terms which do not contain the enhancement factor c(k ) . with this assumption",
    "the only contribution to the cross section comes from the even partial waves listed in table [ table_states ] .",
    "the partial wave amplitudes are functions of both , @xmath90 and @xmath91 but since these two quantities are linked by energy conservation one of them is redundant .",
    "terms linear in k or q will be absent which can be seen as follows .",

    "it is interesting to know how much we can improve the agreement by disposing of the various corrections discussed in the preceding section and represented by the adjustable parameters @xmath111 . before proceeding ,",
    "however , it should be observed that in the case of the pp effective mass distribution a major simplification takes place because , as apparent from , after integrating over the angles only the s - wave amplitude survives .",

    "it is quite easy to produce a two - peaked distribution with a good @xmath121 . since it is not quite certain that the data really reveal a two - peaked distribution we did not pursue this fit any further .",
    "it should be also mentioned that when the interference term linear in c(k ) is accounted for , the calculation becomes very sensitive to the nn potential used to obtain c(k ) because the normalization of c(k ) can not be absorbed in the overall normalization of the cross - section .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] we are going to present the changes in the excitation energy distribution caused by adding an energy dependent term to the eta production amplitude ( the interference terms in give no contribution ) .",

    "although the corrections go in the right direction but the agreement is still not satisfactory and we have to accept the fact that for q=41  mev the assumed functional form of the cross - section is incomplete .",
    "we tried to include the interference terms with the d - waves but the fit was unsuccessful .",
    "clearly , further extensions call for additional parameters but this does not seem to be affordable with the present data , and therefore we stop here .    summarizing , a simple model in which the @xmath0 cross section contains only the dominant @xmath3 partial wave amplitude corrected by the final state pp interaction is capable of explaining the current experimental data at an excitation energy q=15.5  mev . the experimental pp and the @xmath2p effective mass distributions can be both reproduced if : ( i ) in the eta production amplitude a correction linear in energy is admitted and , ( ii ) the full pp fsi enhancement factor without the on - shell approximation is used . in the presented calculation the @xmath2p final state interaction has not been included explicitly for reasons outlined in the introduction but since the parameters x and y have been adjusted to the data , they effectively account for this effect .",
