    "in high finesse semiconductor microcavities with embedded quantum wells , the demonstration of the strong coupling regime between the quantum well excitons and the cavity photons @xcite has opened the way to a refined manipulation of a new species , cavity polaritons , that are mixed light - matter eigenstates . while strong coupling or normal mode coupling appears for very small photon numbers , polaritons exhibit a number of nonlinear behaviors @xcite .",
    "polariton bleaching has been observed at high excitation density @xcite and is predicted to give rise to optical bistability @xcite . with intermediate excitation densities for which strong coupling still exists , these systems exhibit strong nonlinear emission , due to parametric polariton amplification .",
    "the nonlinearity comes from the exciton part of the polariton through coherent exciton - exciton scattering .",
    "the polariton scattering must fulfil phase matching conditions for the in - plane wave vector of the considered polaritons . if @xmath0 is the wave vector of the excitation , two polaritons with wave vector @xmath0 scatter to give polaritons with wave vectors @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , energy conservation implies that @xmath3 .",
    "most of the experiments on the polariton parametric amplification have been performed in the magic angle configuration @xcite , where @xmath4 is the nontrivial solution for the energy conservation condition .",
    "however , there also exists a trivial solution @xmath5 where only the @xmath6 mode is involved . in this case , in the same way as in degenerate parametric amplification , polaritonic wave mixing gives rise to phase dependent amplification @xcite and eventually to polariton squeezing @xcite .    in this geometry of excitation ,",
    "the effective hamiltonian ( at first order ) for the polariton - polariton interaction @xcite is analogous to the hamiltonian of an optical kerr medium .",
    "the difference is that the refraction index depends on the polariton number instead of the photon number .",
    "this gives rise to a bistable behavior for high enough excitation intensities , in the same way as for a kerr medium in a cavity .",
    "optical bistability has already been observed in quantum well microcavities in the weak coupling regime @xcite ; it has been predicted to occur in the strong coupling regime due to exciton bleaching @xcite , however in different conditions .    in this paper",
    "we give experimental evidence for a bistable behavior in a microcavity sample in the strong coupling regime . to our knowledge , this is the first observation of bistability in the strong coupling regime .",
    "we also investigate the nonlinear patterns that appear in the transverse plane .",
    "we show that the main features of the experimental results can be explained satisfactorily by treating the polariton - polariton interaction at first order , i.e. in terms of a polariton kerr effect .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "i , we give the effective hamiltonian for the polariton system , using the same set of hypotheses that has been used for the study of the `` magic angle '' configuration @xcite .",
    "we establish the evolution equation for the polariton field , and we solve the steady - state regime in order to compute the bistability threshold , as well as the reflectivity and transmission spectra .",
    "section ii is the experimental study of the bistability regime .",
    "we show that it is necessary to take transverse effects into account and we compare the experimental results with the prediction of the model studied in section i , including a simple treatment of the transverse effects .",
    "the linear hamiltonian for excitons and cavity photons is @xmath7 with    @xmath8    in this equation @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the creation operators for photons and excitons with a wave vector @xmath11 in the layer plane . because of the translational invariance in the cavity plane , photons can only interact with excitons having the same @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) is the cavity ( exciton ) dispersion and @xmath14 is the rabi interaction energy between excitons and photons",
    ". the normal modes of the linear hamiltonian @xmath15 are called cavity polaritons .",
    "the annihilation operators @xmath16 , @xmath17 for the lower and upper polaritons are given by    @xmath18    where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the hopfield coefficients    @xmath21    with @xmath22 . in the polariton basis ,",
    "the linear hamiltonian reads    @xmath23    where @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) is the lower ( upper ) polariton dispersion , given by    @xmath26    the coulomb interaction between the carriers gives rise to two additional terms : an effective exciton - exciton interaction term and an anharmonic saturation term in the light - exciton coupling .",
    "the exciton - exciton interaction term is    @xmath27    with @xmath28 provided @xmath29 , @xmath30 being the two - dimensional bohr radius of the exciton , @xmath31 the dielectric constant of the quantum wells and @xmath32 the quantization area .",
    "the saturation term writes    @xmath33    with @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the exciton saturation density . as long as the nonlinear terms are small compared to the rabi splitting @xmath14 , it is possible to neglect the nonlinear interaction between the upper and lower branches , which yields non secular terms .",
    "the two polaritons are then virtually decoupled and it is more appropriate to use the polariton basis . in addition",
    ", we consider a resonant excitation of the lower branch by a quasi - monochromatic laser field and we will focus our attention on the evolution of the lower branch polariton . in terms of the lower polariton operator the hamiltonian is @xmath36 .",
    "the free polariton term is @xmath37 .",
    "the effective polariton - polariton interaction term is    @xmath38    with    @xmath39    for the typical parameters",
    "@xmath14=3 mev , @xmath30=100   and @xmath31=(3.5)@xmath40 @xmath41 we find @xmath42 0.012 .",
    "therefore in equation ( [ nleff ] ) we can neglect the saturation term with respect to the coulomb interaction term ( except for the case of an extreme negative detuning , where one can have @xmath43 ) :    @xmath44    in the following we consider a resonant excitation at normal incidence ( in the @xmath6 direction ) and we study the reflected field ( again in the @xmath6 direction ) . in this case",
    "the interaction of the @xmath6 polaritons with other modes gives rise to the collision broadening calculated by c. ciuti in ref .",
    "he predicted a threshold behavior of the broadening . the exciton density at threshold is @xmath45 = 7.10@xmath46 @xmath47 at @xmath48 = 3 mev for a sample with a rabi splitting @xmath49 = 3 mev",
    "below this threshold , we can neglect the collision broadening and keep only the lowest order term .",
    "only a kerr - like nonlinear term remains :    @xmath50    finally we include a term describing the coupling between the cavity mode and the external pump field of frequency @xmath51 , treated as a classical field with amplitude @xmath52 @xcite :    @xmath53    where @xmath54 the dissipation coefficient of the front mirror of the cavity .",
    "the evolution equation for the lower polariton operator then reads :    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the frequency detuning between the polariton resonance and the laser .",
    "@xmath57 is the polariton linewidth , which is given in our simple coupled oscillator model by @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the bare cavity and exciton linewidths , respectively .",
    "this gives correct values of the linewidth at low excitation density for a limited range of detunings around zero detuning . at higher",
    "excitation the collision broadening should be taken into account .",
    "@xmath61 is the polariton effective nonlinear coefficient given by    @xmath62    equation ( [ evolpolariton ] ) will be our starting point for the study of the nonlinear effects .",
    "it is analogous to the evolution equation of the optical field in a cavity containing an ideal passive kerr medium .",
    "it is therefore expected that the nonlinear polariton system should exhibit bistability .",
    "let us note that our system is made more complex by the composite nature of the cavity polaritons .",
    "all the parameters , like the polariton linewidth , the nonlinear coefficient and the coupling to radiation are functions of the cavity - exciton detuning , which determines the photon and exciton contents of the polariton .",
    "we rewrite equation ( [ evolpolariton ] ) for the mean fields and we solve the stationary regime :    @xmath63    where @xmath64 is the mean number of polaritons . multiplying equation ( [ intracav2 ] ) by its conjugate",
    ", we obtain an equation for @xmath65    @xmath66    the plot of @xmath65 versus the excitation power shows a bistable behavior for certain values of @xmath67 , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ bistability ] . for a range of values of the driving laser power",
    "the polariton number is found to have two possible values , located on the higher and the lower stable branches of the curve ( the intermediate branch is well known to be unstable ) .",
    "the turning points are given by the equation @xmath68 :    @xmath69    the discriminant of this equation writes    @xmath70    a bistable behavior is obtained for positive values of the discriminant , i.e. @xmath71",
    ". moreover the solutions for @xmath65 should be positive real numbers .",
    "combining these two conditions , bistability is obtained when    @xmath72    in this case , the value of @xmath65 corresponding to the bistability turning point writes    @xmath73    and one can simply obtain from ( [ intracav ] ) the corresponding threshold for the excitation intensity :    @xmath74      the lowest threshold is obtained when the detuning between the laser and the polariton resonance @xmath67 is equal to @xmath75 .",
    "the corresponding threshold is    @xmath76    it is interesting to study the variations of the threshold with the cavity - exciton detuning @xmath48 . using equations ( [ hopfield1 ] ) , ( [ hopfield2 ] ) and ( [ alphapol ] ) to replace @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath61 , the threshold can be written as    @xmath79    the variations of the threshold versus the cavity - exciton detuning are shown in fig .",
    "[ bistab ] .",
    "the threshold intensity is found to reach a minimum value for the detuning @xmath80 given by    @xmath81    with the parameters of fig .",
    "[ bistab ] we find @xmath82=1.72 mev . as explained in the previous section , the optical response of the system",
    "is governed by the composite nature of the polariton , whith exciton and photon fractions depending on the cavity - exciton detuning .",
    "the value @xmath80 of the detuning is the result of a trade - off between coupling to the external radiation ( which is stronger for negative detuning , when the polariton tends to a photon ) and nonlinearity ( which is stronger for positive detuning , when the polariton tends to an exciton ) .      in this section",
    "we compute the reflectivity , absorption and transmission spectra , which show hysteresis cycles above the bistability threshold .",
    "the reflectivity and transmission coefficients are obtained in the following way .",
    "first we compute the stationary mean value @xmath83 of the intracavity polariton field using equation ( [ intracav2 ] ) .",
    "then we compute the mean value of the intracavity photon field using equations ( [ def1])-([def2 ] ) and the fact that the upper polariton field @xmath84 is set to zero , which yields the simple relationship @xmath85 . finally the reflected and transmitted fields are calculated using the input - output relationships @xmath86 for i=1,2 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath32 are given respectively by @xmath89 , @xmath90 and 1-@xmath87-@xmath88 .",
    "bistability can be evidenced by scanning the input intensity for a fixed detuning between the exciton and the cavity .",
    "alternatively , it is possible to scan the cavity length for a fixed value of the input intensity , as for atoms in cavity @xcite . in a semiconductor microcavity , this can be done by scanning the excitation spot on the sample surface , since the cavity is wedged ( i.e. there is a slight angle between the bragg mirrors ) .",
    "[ reflec1 ] shows the variations of r with the cavity - exciton detuning for three values of @xmath91 ( close to zero , below and above the bistability threshold ) . for the highest intensity",
    ", the reflectivity spectrum shows the characteristic hysteresis cycle .",
    "the output power switches abruptly when the position of the excitation spot is scanned ; in the bistable region the output power depends on the direction of the scan . the hysteresis cycle can also be seen on the transmission and absorption spectra .",
    "thus our theoretical model shows that the exciton - exciton interaction in semiconductor microcavities leads to an optically bistable regime in the frequency region of the polariton resonance .",
    "an alternative mechanism for achieving optical bistability was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , using the bleaching of the rabi splitting ; in contrast with this case , we obtain the present effect when the exciton - exciton interaction term is much smaller than the rabi splitting term .",
    "we also stress that this mechanism is different from the optical bistability which has been demonstrated in semiconductor microcavities at room temperature @xcite , since it involves an exciton - photon mixed mode instead of a cavity mode .",
    "the microcavity sample consists of one in@xmath92ga@xmath93as quantum well embedded in a @xmath94 gaas spacer , sandwiched between 20 ( 26.5 ) pairs of ga@xmath95al@xmath96as / alas distributed bragg reflectors on top ( bottom ) .",
    "the linewidths ( fwhm ) of the bare exciton and cavity modes are respectively 0.15 mev and 0.24 mev and the rabi splitting is @xmath14=2.8 mev . the sample is held in a cold - finger cryostat at a temperature of 4k .",
    "the cavity has a slight wedge which allows to tune the cavity length by scanning the position of excitation on the sample .",
    "the light source is a single - mode tunable cw ti : sapphire laser with a linewidth of the order of 1 mhz .",
    "the laser beam is power - stabilized by means of an electro - optic modulator and spatially filtered by a 2 m - long single - mode fiber .",
    "the spot diameter is 50 @xmath97 m . in all experiments",
    "the lower polariton branch was excited near resonance at normal incidence with a @xmath98 polarized beam .",
    "the image of the excitation spot on the sample surface is made on a ccd camera .",
    "indeed spatial effects are important in our system . on the one hand , due to the slight angle between",
    "the cavity mirrors the polariton energy depends linearly on the position ; on the other hand the nonlinearity gives rise to spatial patterns due to the gaussian intensity distribution in the laser spot .",
    "transverse effects are thus critical for the understanding of the optical response of the sample and we will present their experimental study first .        we first studied the near field of the reflected beam . at sufficiently low excitation intensity , the spot shows a dark vertical line corresponding to absorption occurring on the polariton resonance .",
    "the variation of absorption with the position is due to the slight angle between the cavity mirrors , and the dark line is a line of equal thickness of the microcavity . at higher laser intensities , even well below the bistability threshold",
    ", one observes a strong distortion of the resonance line as shown in fig .",
    "[ imageexp ] .",
    "when scanning the spot position on the sample ( which amounts to scanning the polariton energy ) one can see a change from a crescent shape to a ring shape , and then to a dot shape .",
    "+   +      in order to understand these results we have computed the reflectivity of the microcavity in the transverse plane , taking both the gaussian intensity distribution of the excitation spot and the wedged shape of the cavity into account .",
    "the excitation spot is discretized into small spots with different local excitation densities and local cavity thicknesses .",
    "the pixels are assumed to be uncorrelated to each other .",
    "for each spot we compute the reflectivity from ( [ evolpolariton ] ) .",
    "this is the simplest possible treatment , which includes neither the transverse mode structure of the microcavity @xcite ( since it is based on a plane - wave approximation ) , nor the effect of diffraction .",
    "however it gives a good qualitative understanding of the shape of the absorption region .    at low intensity",
    ", the resonance region is found to be a straight line , as observed in the experiments .",
    "the results at higher intensity with the experimental parameters of fig .",
    "[ imageexp ] can be seen in fig .",
    "[ imagetheo ] for two different positions of the excitation spot .",
    "the main resonant region can be seen near the center of the spot ; depending on the position of the spot , its shape is that of a crescent , a ring or a dot , in good agreement with the experimental results .",
    "the shape of the resonance region can be understood as resulting from exact compensation between the nonlinear energy shift due to the intensity variations , and the linear energy shift due to the cavity thickness variations .",
    "the results of fig .",
    "[ imagetheo ] are in good agreement with the first two pictures of fig .",
    "[ imageexp ] that correspond to the same parameters .",
    "the blinking of the dark absorption dot as a whole in the bistable region can not be reproduced by our model , because it is linked to the spatial coherence over the size of the dot ( i.e. the size of the polariton mode ) , while in our model there are no spatial correlations between the pixels used in the calculation .      in view of these transverse effects",
    ", the interpretation of the reflectivity spectrum will be much simpler if we select a small zone on the sample in order to avoid averaging the optical response on the spot surface .",
    "one solution would be to have an excitation spot with a uniform distribution in intensity , sufficiently small so that the cavity wedge would be negligible .",
    "spatial selection can be also easily achieved by spatial filtering of the reflected beam .",
    "we used a spatial filter for the reflected light in order to select only a small fraction of the excitation spot .",
    "the filter has the size of the dark absorption dot of fig .",
    "[ imageexp ] , i.e. about 10 @xmath97 m in diameter .",
    "two photodiodes allow to measure the reflected and transmitted intensities .",
    "each spectrum is obtained at fixed excitation energy and intensity , by scanning the spot position over the sample surface .",
    "this is equivalent to a scan of the cavity length . as a result ,",
    "the precision of the measurements is limited by the surface defects of the sample .",
    "[ reflecexp ] shows a series of spectra for several values of the excitation intensity .    we observed a shift of the resonance position , which is proportional to the excitation intensity ( see fig .",
    "[ shift ] ) .",
    "the resonance position shifts towards negative detunings , corresponding to a blueshift of the resonance energy .",
    "this is in agreement with the model , where the blueshift is given by the effective hamiltonian ( [ nonlineaire ] ) .",
    "the shift has been removed in fig .",
    "[ reflecexp ] , so that all the curves appear to be peaked around the same position .    above a threshold intensity",
    ", one can observe as expected an hysteresis cycle by scanning the sample position in the two directions ( fig .",
    "[ reflecexp ] ) . the bistability threshold can be determined with a good precision by observing the spontaneous `` blinking '' between the two stable values , due to the intensity fluctuations or mechanical vibrations of optic elements on the set - up . in the case of fig .",
    "[ reflecexp ] @xmath99 = 2.8 mw .",
    "the variations of the bistability threshold with the cavity - exciton detuning are shown in fig .",
    "[ seuilexp ] .",
    "we did nt use any spatial filter here .    in the context of our previous assumption of small independent pixels , a precise calculation of the bistability threshold",
    "is not possible ; the model predicts that each pixel of the excitation spot has its own bistability threshold .",
    "however , we can make a crude estimate by assuming that bistability occurs as soon as the local density of excitation in the center of the spot exceeds the bistability threshold calculated in ( [ threshold ] ) . as a result",
    ", we have to divide the threshold ( [ threshold ] ) by the ratio of the local density at the center of the spot by the mean density of excitation , which is found to be @xmath100 .",
    "the value of the nonlinear coefficient @xmath61 is calculated using expression ( [ alphapol ] ) with the measured spot diameter of @xmath101 = 38 @xmath1024 @xmath97 m .",
    "the polariton linewidth @xmath57 is estimated from a reflectivity measurement at @xmath48 = 1.5 mev , which must be taken at threshold because the linewidth increases with the excitation density due to collision broadening .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we have neglected the variations of @xmath57 in the considered range of cavity - exciton detunings ( inferior to ten percent ) . the solid line in fig .",
    "[ seuilexp ] is the result of the model .",
    "it is in fair agreement with the experimental curve . as an illustration , error bars",
    "have been added for the point on the theoretical curve at @xmath48 = 1.5 mev corresponding to the uncertainties in measuring the parameters of the fit @xmath103 and @xmath57 .",
    "the general shape of the curve corresponds to the expected behavior , except when the detuning goes down to zero where the threshold intensity goes up very quickly ( for example it is superior to 25 mw for @xmath48=0.3 mev ) .",
    "a more elaborate model including the transverse mode structure of the microcavity and diffraction is needed in order to understand this effect .",
    "the minimal threshold is obtained at slightly positive detuning , near the theoretical value .",
    "we have reported the first observation of polaritonic bistability in semiconductor microcavities .",
    "it is obtained in the context of parametric polariton interaction in the degenerate case , where only the pumped mode at @xmath104 is involved . a simple model treating the non - linearity as a kerr type one gives a relatively good agreement with the experimental results .",
    "the originality of the bistable behavior reported here , is that it occurs in the strong coupling regime : the effective refraction index depends on the polariton number instead of the photons number .",
    "moreover , it is well - known that kerr media can be used for the production of squeezed states of light . in the same way , this non - linear mechanism can be used to produce squeezed states of the mixed light - matter polariton field @xcite .",
