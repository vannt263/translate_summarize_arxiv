    "the astra cassegrain spectrophotometer and its automated 0.5-m telescope at fairborn observatory in arizona will produce a large quantity of high - precision stellar flux distributions .",
    "a separate paper , @xcite , presented a review the design criteria for the system and an overview of its operation . in this paper",
    "we discuss the techniques used in the data reduction to final flux calibrations .",
    "astra will produce a vast quantity of high quality data .",
    "the reduction procedures will be automated as far as possible , using software sentinels to watch for unusual events .",
    "the spectrophotometric observations taken by astra comprise ccd frames containing two spectral orders .",
    "the orders are sufficiently separated that there is no order overlap and each order contains both the target spectrum as well as sky background .",
    "spectral extraction is performed using a highly automated version of the ccdspec reduction package developed by @xcite .",
    "spectral extraction follows the procedures common to normal spectra , starting with correction for ccd properties , including dead rows , hot pixels .",
    "next , bias corrections and flat fielding is performed using master calibration frames obtained from the addition of many bias and flat field frames .",
    "order tracing is performed and psf fitting using optimal extraction , followed by scattered light removal and the removal of cosmic rays .",
    "details can be found in @xcite .    as part of the commissioning process",
    "we will characterise the extent of ccd fringing , determine shutter timing corrections , and assess the nature of any flexure of spectrograph .    unlike normal spectroscopy",
    ", spectrophotometry can be regarded as precise relative photometry at many wavelengths .",
    "hence , the spectral extraction procedure must recover exactly the same relative proportion of observed flux at every wavelength from all observed spectra .",
    "since the spectral width depends on atmospheric seeing and the amount of telescope trailing , the extraction aperture must be varied to ensure the same fractional spectral energy is covered .",
    "the @xcite optimal extraction algorithm maintains spectrophotometric calibration validity .",
    "it is also important to preserve the observed count level and not re - bin onto a linear wavelength scale , since this will affect the atmospheric extinction determination .",
    "the output from this stage of the reduction procedure is instrumental wavelengths and counts / s per wavelength bin , plus an estimate of the uncertainty in the counts .",
    "figure  [ smalley - fig1 ] shows an example of a simulated extracted spectra for a 10th - magnitude a0v star .",
    "it shows that the 1-hour integration has produced a signal - to - noise ( s / n ) in excess of 200:1 in most of the range from @xmath037009300 .",
    "the earth s atmosphere has a considerable effect on the stellar flux as measured from the surface .",
    "the principal sources of extinction , rayleigh and aerosol scattering , ozone and telluric line absorption , will be discussed , along with methods used to determine their effects on the observed spectra .",
    "rayleigh scattering due to molecules in the atmosphere is proportional to @xmath1 , with detailed formulae given by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "vertical extinction is proportional to local atmospheric pressure .",
    "aerosol scattering is due to dust particles , salt particles , water droplets , man - made pollutants in the earth s atmosphere @xcite .",
    "we can model aerosol absorption using angstrm s simple empirical approximation formula @xmath2 .",
    "aerosol extinction is quite variable , with @xmath3 showing diurnal and seasonal variations to a factor of two or more , and @xmath4 .",
    "the huggins band provides the ultraviolet cut - off and the chappuis band is present in the green part of the optical spectrum , with two strong diffuse peaks around 5730  and 6020 .",
    "high - resolution absorption coefficients are available @xcite .",
    "ozone is concentrated at altitudes between 10 and 35 km , and can vary significantly in a few hours @xcite .",
    "typically , chappuis can contribute around 0.01  mag .",
    "of absorption per airmass .",
    "several bands of discrete absorption lines , especially in the red and near - ir : oxygen ( o@xmath5 ) around 7590  and 6870 , and water vapour ( h@xmath5o ) bands near 7100 , 8090 , 8920 , and 9277 .",
    "water vapour is highly variable with irregular night - to - night and seasonal variations .",
    "the h@xmath5o bands do not follow the normal exponential absorption ( bouguer ) law , but show a curve - of - growth effect @xcite .",
    "extinction by the earth s atmosphere is given by bouguer s law , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is observed stellar magnitude at wavelength ( @xmath8 ) ; @xmath9 is stellar magnitude above earth s atmosphere ; @xmath10 is extinction coefficient ( mag./airmass ) ; and @xmath11 is the airmass relative to that at the zenith .",
    "the total extinction coefficient at each wavelength is the sum of the various individual contributions : rayleigh , aerosol , ozone , oxygen and water ( see fig .  [ smalley - fig2 ] ) .      in the classical text",
    ", @xcite gives a polynomial formula for calculating airmass ( @xmath11 ) from zenith distance ( @xmath12 ) . in his review , @xcite discussed airmass calculations and advocated the use of a simpler formula , @xmath13,\\ ] ] which is valid up to @xmath14 and good to better than 1% .",
    "@xcite also warns that airmasses greater than 4 should be avoided because of large random and systematic errors .",
    "airmass can change significantly during a long exposure .",
    "in such cases we can use effective airmass @xcite , @xmath15.\\ ] ] this is valid provided that extinction is not varying significantly as during the exposure . an alternative is to take multiple shorter exposures .      in slit - less spectroscopy resolution",
    "depends on seeing .",
    "we can characterise the spectral resolution as follows , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the size of the stellar seeing disk and @xmath18 is the fixed instrumental resolution for an idealised point - size stellar image .",
    "seeing is naturally highly variable , with not only temporal variations ( @xmath19 ) , but also variations with airmass ( @xmath20 ) and wavelength ( @xmath21 ) @xcite .",
    "the variation with wavelength can be regarded as fixed , but this resolution is different from the instrumental value as determined by arc spectra .      since the resolution of the spectra is variable , we must allow for this during the extinction determination .",
    "this is most important where spectrum is varying most rapidly , e.g. balmer lines .",
    "table  [ smalley - table ] gives the results that are obtained when simple bouguer law is used to fit to various points within the h@xmath22 balmer line during a simulated night of relatively poor seeing .",
    "the fit for the balmer core is significantly different from the true value , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ smalley - fig3 ] which shows that the depth of the core varies noticeably with airmass .",
    "ccc @xmath8 & @xmath23(fit ) & @xmath23(true ) + 4867 & 0.157 & 0.184 + 4894 & 0.178 & 0.180 + 4940 & 0.174 & 0.176 +    the effects of varying resolution become important on nights of poor seeing and when seeing is variable .",
    "scintillation noise is due to motion in the earth s atmosphere during an exposure and sets a limit on photometric accuracy .",
    "this can be estimated using the @xcite formula , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the scintillation noise in magnitudes , @xmath26 is the diameter of the telescope ( cm ) , @xmath27 altitude of the telescope ( m ) , @xmath28 scale height of the atmosphere ( @xmath298000 m ) and @xmath30 is the exposure time in seconds .",
    "the normal minimum exposure time for astra is 10 seconds in order to minimise scintillation noise .",
    "a 10-second exposure gives @xmath25 = 0.001 mag . at the zenith and 0.007 mag .",
    "for x = 3 .",
    "longer exposures give lower levels of scintillation noise .",
    "extinction determination will be performed without the use of any assumed stellar true fluxes .",
    "the extinction stars are tested to be constant , with any variability @xmath31 0.01 mag .",
    "any extinction stars found to be significantly variable will be removed from the list of standard stars and extinction re - determined .",
    "extinction determination is performed for a single night of observations and its reliability assessed .",
    "we will investigate the use of multi - night reductions .",
    "the brightest stars have to be observed through a neutral density filter .",
    "we will determine and monitor the throughput .",
    "the filter transmission function enters the extinction determination as an extra term in the fitting procedure @xcite .",
    "atmospheric extinction is variable .",
    "this usually appears as a gradual decrease during the night , due to a slow fallout of aerosols @xcite . for a few hours",
    ", the extinction change can be represented by a linear function with time .",
    "observationally , we must observe enough extinction stars to maintain a nearly continuous check on the extinction coefficients .",
    "short exposures are required to avoid significant changes in airmass and extinction .",
    "@xcite weighted each observation by @xmath32 so that residuals have units of mag./airmass .",
    "thus residuals against time allows deviations from mean extinction to be spotted .    initially we assume a perfect night and use a time - independent multi - star bouguer law fitting procedure as described in @xcite using least - squares techniques ( *",
    "the residuals from the fits are assessed using a variety of techniques to look for variations and correlations with time and/or airmass .",
    "checks are also made to ensure that none of the extinction stars is variable .",
    "as well as examining the @xmath33 , we will use r - statistics as defined by @xcite , @xmath34 where @xmath35 .",
    "these measure the degree of correlation of the residuals for adjacent values , which must be strictly monotonic .",
    "in addition , a 2-d grey - scale image plot of residuals against wavelength and time is a very useful diagnostic .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ smalley - fig4 ] shows a simulation of a night with highly variable extinction , including changes in ozone and water , and a spell of grey absorption due to a passing cloud band .",
    "if variable , we can use @xmath36 as a low - order polynomial in time , adding extra terms and using an f - test for the significance of improvement ( * ? ? ?",
    "10 ) . if necessary",
    ", we can split the night into smaller blocks , in order to avoid parts with poor conditions .",
    "non - linear extinction violates bouguer s law .",
    "several methods have been used in the literature , but we will use synthetic telluric spectra .",
    "non - linear least - squares fitting is used to determine oxygen and water columns and their temporal variability .",
    "theoretical transmission functions can be calculated using the hitran molecular line lists @xcite and a simplified 6-layer model of the earth s atmosphere @xcite .",
    "these are calculated with varying water and oxygen columns and tabulated at high resolution ( 0.5steps ) for rapid interpolation .    at the resolution of the astra instrument",
    "the individual telluric lines are not resolved .",
    "thus , flux through each resolution element will depend on the nature of the intrinsic telluric lines and any stellar features within that region .",
    "strong absorption ( or emission ) features may be hidden by the lines or ` visible ' between them .",
    "we can not _ a priori _ know which case is occurring in each band ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we also have to beware of stellar lines ( dis)appearing in and out of telluric lines due to radial velocity variations .",
    "the earth s orbital velocity ( 30 km s@xmath37 ) gives a 0.5  shift at 5000 .",
    "we will assess the level of this uncertainty using synthetic stellar spectra .",
    "spectrophotometric observations must be placed on an absolute flux scale by reference to stars with known values of true flux at top of earth s atmosphere .",
    "standard stars have been calibrated against terrestrial sources of known properties .",
    "unfortunately , very few stars have been calibrated directly .",
    "the primary standard is @xmath38 lyr ( vega ) .",
    "the standard references for absolute fluxes are @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of these and other calibrations was assessed by @xcite .",
    "most calibrations are at relatively low resolution ( typically 50100 ) .",
    "corrections for bandpass effects need to be considered , which may require the use of high - resolution spectra .",
    "@xcite presented a calibration for vega , for use with hst data , which used kurucz atlas9 fluxes to generate a higher - resolution .",
    "a more - recent absolute calibration based stis observations was determined by @xcite .",
    "a discussion of hst standards is given by @xcite .    the astra spectrophotometry will be placed on the vega absolute flux scale .",
    "this will require the use of a neutral density filter , whose throughput will be measured and periodically checked .",
    "whenever , we use the neutral density filter we will observe a suitable star with and without the filter to determine the throughput .",
    "our quality control procedures will assess stellar ( micro ) variability and the long term variability of extinction stars to ensure they are constant .",
    "in addition , we will monitor the instrumental and telescope throughput for variations .",
    "these tests will ensure flux consistency within secondary standards and of the fluxes of all target stars .",
    "re - calibration of whole data set be will performed as necessary . for standards we will use only the best observations at the highest resolution . for other observations",
    ", we will ensure spectral resolution effects are allowed for .",
    "flux calibrated spectra for all observations will be produced .",
    "the individual observations of non - standard stars will be co - added , if non - varying , in order to increase the signal to noise .",
    "variable stars will not be co - added , except if the variations are insignificant between observations .",
    "the reduction procedures will store intermediate results , such as extracted spectra in counts , instrumental counts / second above earth s atmosphere , details of the nightly extinction models , and individual flux calibrated spectra .",
    "the final fluxes will be made available as fits files including headers and processing history .",
    "for each spectral point , we will give wavelength , bin size , instrumental ( counts / s ) , flux relative to vega , absolute fluxes ( photons / s / nm ) , internal errors , external errors , and quality flags .",
    "the reduction of astra spectrophotometry requires careful extraction and calibration in order to achieve stellar flux measurements with internal ( star - to - star ) precision better than 1% for stars brighter than @xmath2910th magnitude . in the regions heavily affected by telluric lines we will not necessarily reach the 1% precision level . for all observations , including faint spectrophotometric standards , we will use full error propagation to include both internal and external errors .",
    "the available absolute calibrations are accurate to typically 12% .",
    "ultimately this uncertainty will limit the accuracy of the final fluxes of other stars .",
    "however , the internal precision will be significantly higher , and should more - accurate absolute calibrations become available the fluxes can be re - calibrated to higher accuracy ."
