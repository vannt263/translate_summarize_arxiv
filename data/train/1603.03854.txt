    "the first physics - based proposal concerning khovanov homology of knots was made by gukov , vafa , and schwarz @xcite , who suggested that vector spaces associated to knots that had been introduced a few years earlier by ooguri and vafa @xcite were related to what appears in khovanov homology .",
    "a number of years later , i re - expressed this type of construction in terms of gauge theory and the counting of solutions of pde s @xcite .",
    "that is the story i will describe today .",
    "several previous lectures are available @xcite ( the second of these may be a better starting point ) and i will take a different approach here .    in any event , the goal is to construct invariants of a knot embedded in @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ knot ] ) . in the simplest version",
    ", the invariants will be obtained by simply counting , with signs , the solutions of an equation .",
    "the solutions will have an integer - valued takes values in a @xmath1-torsor , rather than being canonically an integer .",

    "topological invariant @xmath2 , and if @xmath3 is the `` number '' ( counted algebraically ) of solutions with @xmath4 , then the jones polynomial is such that the jones polynomial of the empty link is 1 .",
    "( the jones polynomial is sometimes defined so that it equals 1 for an unknot rather than for the empty link . )",
    "we normalize the argument @xmath5 of the jones polynomial to be the instanton counting parameter , in a sense that will be explained later . with this choice , the jones polynomial of the unknot ( with standard framing ) is @xmath6 and in general , for a knot with zero framing , the exponents in eqn .",

    "] of the knot will be [ generating]j(q)=_n a_n q^n .    .",
    "[ knot],width=288 ]    to get khovanov homology , this situation is supposed to be `` categorified , '' that is , we want for each @xmath7 to define a complex of vector spaces whose euler characteristic is @xmath3 .",
    "the only general situation that i know of in which one can naturally categorify the counting of solutions of an equation is the case that the equation whose solutions we are counting describes the critical points of some morse function @xmath8",
    ". we will be in this framework .",
    "our equations will be partial differential equations or pde s , so @xmath8 will be a morse function on an infinite - dimensional space of functions , namely the functions that appear in the pde .",
    "the categorification will involve a middle - dimensional cohomology theory of the function space , analogous to floer theory .",
    "let us put this aside for a moment and assume we are just trying to describe the uncategorified theory , that is the jones polynomial .",
    "the equations whose solutions i claim should be counted to define the jones polynomial and ultimately khovanov homology might look ad hoc if written down without an explanation of where they come from .",
    "i could have started today s lecture by explaining the physical setup , but this might be unhelpful for some .",
    "i decided instead to try a different approach of motivating the equations by comparing to an established mathematical approach to khovanov homology , namely symplectic khovanov homology @xcite .",
    "going all the way back to the original work of vaughn jones @xcite , most approaches to the jones polynomial define an invariant in terms of some sort of presentation of a knot , for example a projection to a plane  such as the projection used in drawing fig .",
    "one defines something that is manifestly well - defined and explicitly computable once such a presentation is given .",
    "what one defines is not obviously independent of the knot presentation , but turns out to be .",
    "that step is where the magic is .",
    "and there is always some magic .",
    "an approach based on counting solutions of pde s has the opposite advantages and drawbacks .",
    "topological invariance is potentially manifest ( given certain generalities about elliptic pde s and assuming compactness is under control ) , but it may not be clear how to calculate . the ideal is to have manifest three- or ( in the categorified case ) four - dimensional symmetry together with a method of calculation .",
    "how might this be achieved ?",
    "i will suggest how to guess the right equations starting from a knowledge of symplectic khovanov homology .",
    "but in order to do this , we need to know something about a possible strategy to actually count the solutions of an equation .",
    "so i will begin by explaining what we would do if we knew which equations we want to analyze , and this will help us in guessing the equations .     and stretched in one direction .",
    "[ longknot],width=288 ]    there is a standard strategy , applicable to the present problem , for trying to count solutions of a pde under suitable conditions .",
    "the original version was the atiyah - floer conjecture concerning floer homology of a three - manifold @xcite .",
    "adapting their approach to the present problem , the idea is to stretch a knot in one direction , say the @xmath9 direction , as in fig .",
    "[ longknot ] .",
    "then one wants it to be the case that except near the ends , the solutions are independent of @xmath9 .",
    "this is not automatically the case and in @xcite , where this strategy was followed for the present problem , it was necessary to make a perturbation to a more generic system of equations to get to a situation in which this would be true",
    ".    given this , we define a moduli space @xmath10 of @xmath9-independent solutions .",
    "we can think of these as the solutions in the presence of infinite parallel strands that run in the @xmath9 direction , as in fig .",
    "[ longknotthree ] .    , with @xmath11 .",
    "[ longknotthree],width=288 ]    .",
    "[ longknottwo],width=288 ]    now as in fig .",
    "[ longknottwo ] consider solutions in the presence of semi - infinite strands that extend to @xmath12 or to @xmath13 but not both .",
    "let @xmath14 and @xmath15 be the moduli spaces of such solutions .",
    "thus a point in @xmath14 represents a solution in a semi - infinite situation in which the strands terminate on the left ( as drawn in fig .",
    "[ longknottwo ] ) .",
    "likewise @xmath15 parametrizes solutions in the presence of semi - infinite strands that terminate on the right .",
    "we assume that a solution in such a semi - infinite situation is independent of @xmath9 for @xmath16 or @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "if this is so , then @xmath14 and @xmath15 come with natural maps to @xmath10 .",
    "for simplicity in our terminology , we will assume that these maps are embeddings ; this amounts to assuming that each solution in the interior in fig .",
    "[ longknot ] can be extended over the left or over the right in at most one way .",
    "this assumption is not necessary but makes the explanation simpler .    the solutions for a global knot like the one in fig .",
    "[ longknot ] can be understood as solutions in the middle that extend over both ends .",
    "so the global solutions are intersection points of @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the integer @xmath3 that appears as a coefficient in the jones polynomial is supposed to be the algebraic intersection number of @xmath14 and @xmath15 : [ intno ] a_n = __r .",
    "( to be more exact , @xmath3 is this intersection number computed by counting only intersections with @xmath4 . )    in this language of intersections , categorification can happen if @xmath10 is in a natural way a symplectic manifold and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are lagrangian submanifolds .",
    "then floer cohomology",
    " i.e. the @xmath18-model or the fukaya category  of @xmath10 gives a framework for categorification .",
    "from the point of view of today s lecture , the reason that all this will happen is that , even before we stretched the knot to reduce to intersections in @xmath10 , the equations whose solutions we were counting are equations for critical points of some morse function(al ) @xmath8 .    in `` symplectic khovanov homology , ''",
    "a version of such a story is developed for khovanov homology ( at least in a singly - graded version ) with a very specific @xmath10 .",
    "a description of this @xmath10 that was proposed in @xcite ( and exploited in a mirror version in @xcite ) and which provided an important clue in my work is as follows .",
    "@xmath10 can be understood as a space of hecke modifications .",
    "let me explain this concept .",
    "let @xmath19 be a riemann surface and @xmath20 a holomorphic @xmath21 bundle over @xmath19 , where @xmath21 is some complex lie group .",

    "@xmath7 can be thought of as a weight of the langlands - gno dual group of @xmath30 , which is another copy of @xmath30 .",
    "the reason that i write @xmath21 , making explicit that this is the complex form of the group , is that when we do gauge theory , the gauge group will be the compact real form and i will call this simply @xmath31 . in general , for any @xmath31 , there is a corresponding langlands - gno dual group @xmath32 , with complexification @xmath33 , such that hecke modifications of a holomorphic @xmath21-bundle at a point @xmath23 occur in families classified by dominant weights ( or equivalently finite - dimensional representations ) of @xmath33 ( or equivalently @xmath32 ) .",
    "for example , if @xmath34 , we can think of a @xmath21-bundle @xmath20 as a rank 2 complex vector bundle @xmath20 .",
    "the langlanda - gno dual group @xmath33 is again @xmath35 , and a hecke modification dual to the 2-dimensional representation of @xmath33 is as follows .",
    "for some local decomposition @xmath36 in a neighborhood of @xmath23 , one has @xmath37 .",
    "the difference from the abelian case is that there is not just one hecke modification of this type at @xmath25 but a whole _",

    "[ points ] ) .",
    "the space of all such hecke modifications would be a copy of @xmath44 , with one copy of @xmath45 at each point .",

    "we want to reinterpret this in terms of gauge theory pde s .    in my work with kapustin on gauge theory and geometric langlands @xcite ,",
    "an important fact was that @xmath10 can be realized as a moduli space of solutions of a certain system of pde s .",
    "however , although @xmath10 is defined in terms of bundles on a 2-manifold @xmath55 , the pde s are in 3 dimensions  on @xmath0 . as a result of this ,",
    "everything in the rest of the lecture will be in a dimension one more than one might expect .",
    "to describe the jones polynomial  an invariant of knots in 3-space  we will count solutions of certain pde s in 4 dimensions , and the categorified version ",
    "khovanov homology  will involve pde s in 5 dimensions .    the 3-dimensional pde s that we need are known as the bogomolny equations .",

    "the bogomolny equations have many remarkable properties and we will focus on just one aspect .",

    "this construction can be used to account for a number of properties of spaces of hecke modifications , but for today we want to focus on the application to knot theory .",

    "a surface operator in six dimensions supported on @xmath282 reduces in the gauge theory description to an t hooft - like surface operator supported on @xmath296 , where @xmath297 projects to @xmath298 .",
    "a solution of the hw equations in the presence of this surface operator is supposed to have a singularity along @xmath296 .",
    "this codimension three singularity should be modeled on the standard codimension three singularity of the bogomolny equations , suitably embedded in the hw equations with gauge group @xmath31 .",
    "to categorify the quantum knot invariants associated to a representation @xmath105 of a simply - laced is not simply - laced , one requires a refinement described in section 5.5 of @xcite . ] compact lie group @xmath32 , one studies the hw equations with gauge group @xmath31 ( the langlands - gno dual of @xmath32 , which in particular has the same lie algebra as @xmath32 if @xmath31 is simply - laced ) , and with the appropriate singularity along @xmath296 .",
    "the appropriate singularity is obtained , as discussed in lecture one , by embedding a singular @xmath75 solution in @xmath31 using the homomorphism @xmath299 that is dual to @xmath105 .",
    "the hw equations on @xmath290 are compatible with the familiar codimension three singularity on a two - manifold @xmath300 if and only if @xmath136 is of the form @xmath296 with @xmath301 , @xmath298 .",
    "this statement is easily verified by inspection of the hw equations . the explanation that we have given here starting with the @xmath269 model serves to explain `` why '' it is true .",
    "the restriction to @xmath302 is completely essential for getting knot theory out of this construction , since the relevant topology would disappear if @xmath136 were free to move in five dimensions .",
    "for example , khovanov homology arises in the `` time''-independent case @xmath303 , where @xmath159 is a knot in @xmath0 and the first factor in @xmath304 is parametrized by the `` time . ''",
    "if @xmath136 were free to vary in @xmath290 , then @xmath159 would be free to vary in @xmath305 ( the product of the last two factors in @xmath306 ) , and could be trivially unknotted .",
    "much the same point was made in lecture one . a more general @xmath136 ( not of the time - independent form @xmath307 )",
    "is used to define the `` morphisms '' of khovanov homology .",
    "what we have described corresponds to the singly - graded version of khovanov homology ( with only the cohomological grading and no `` @xmath5''-grading ) .",
    "the single grading comes from the symmetry group @xmath308 that was maintained throughout the construction . to get doubly - graded khovanov homology",
    ", one takes @xmath19 to be not @xmath309 but @xmath48 .",
    "this is done by adding to @xmath30 a point @xmath310 `` at infinity . ''",
    "@xmath48 admits an @xmath293 action , leaving fixed the point @xmath310 . in the underlying @xmath269 model ,",
    "one considers a surface operator supported on @xmath311 .",
    "reduction of @xmath277 on the orbits of @xmath293 leads now to a description in terms of gauge theory on @xmath312 ( where @xmath152 , a half - line , is the quotient @xmath313 ) .",
    "the @xmath293 action leads to the desired second grading .",
    "this doubly - graded version of the construction was the main subject of @xcite , and the details will not be repeated here .",
