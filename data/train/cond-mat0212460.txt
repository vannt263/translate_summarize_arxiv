    "the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) in two dimensions ( 2d ) has been a subject of intensive research in recent years  [ 1 ] but the physics behind this phenomenon is still not understood .",
    "it has been established , however , that it occurs in the regime where both coulomb ( electron - electron ) interactions and disorder are strong .",
    "the competition between these two effects has been suggested [ 2 ] to lead to glassy dynamics ( electron or coulomb glass ) .",
    "therefore , it has been proposed that the 2d mit can be described alternatively as the melting of the wigner glass [ 3 ] , or the melting of the coulomb glass [ 4 ] .",
    "the existence of a large number of metastable states in a glass results in fluctuations of conductivity @xmath6 with time ( conductivity noise ) so that mesoscopic samples should be more suitable for studies of glassy properties .",
    "indeed , investigations of metallic spin glasses have shown [ 5 ] that mesoscopic measurements are necessary in order to provide detailed understanding of glassy ordering and dynamics . here",
    "we report the results of transport and noise studies in mesoscopic samples , which demonstrate for the first time the existence of a glassy phase in a 2d system in semiconductor heterostructures .",
    "the measurements were performed on a 1  @xmath7 m long , 90  @xmath7 m wide rectangular n - channel si metal - oxide - semiconductor field - effect transistor ( mosfet ) with the peak mobility of only @xmath8m@xmath9/vs at 4.2  k. other sample details have been given elsewhere [ 6 ] .",
    "the fluctuations of current @xmath10 ( _ i .",
    "e. _ @xmath6 ) as a function of time were measured using a low - noise current preamplifier and a standard two - probe lock - in technique at @xmath11  hz with the constant excitation voltage @xmath12 a few @xmath7v . by changing the gate voltage @xmath13",
    ", the electron density @xmath0 was varied between @xmath14@xmath15 and @xmath16@xmath15 , whereas temperature @xmath17 ranged between 0.13  k and 0.80  k. it was established that the current fluctuations were not correlated with ( _ i.  e. _ not due to ) the fluctuations of temperature or applied voltage . in addition",
    ", another sample from the same wafer was measured in a four - terminal configuration at 0.25  k , and it was determined that the contact resistances and the contact noise were negligible .",
    "1 ( left ) shows the time dependence of the relative fluctuations @xmath18 ( where @xmath19 denotes averaging over time ) for a fixed @xmath0 at different @xmath17 . at the lowest @xmath20  k ,",
    "fluctuations are as high as 250  @xmath21 , and drop rapidly with increasing @xmath17 .",
    "a similar decrease in fluctuations was observed with increasing @xmath0 , as discussed in more detail below .",
    "the time - averaged conductivity @xmath22 was calculated for time intervals of several hours , for all @xmath0 and @xmath17 .",
    "1 ( right ) depicts @xmath22 as a function of @xmath17 at selected @xmath0 .",
    "similar to the behavior of various high - mobility 2d systems  [ 1 ] , the temperature coefficient of conductivity @xmath23 changes sign when @xmath24 . even though the corresponding density @xmath25@xmath15 is much higher due to a large amount of disorder in our samples , the effective coulomb interaction is still comparable to that in other 2d systems ( @xmath26 , @xmath27  ratio of coulomb energy to fermi energy ) .",
    "the densities @xmath28 , where @xmath29 , have been usually  [ 1 ] identified with the critical density @xmath30 for the metal - insulator transition . however , a thorough analysis of @xmath31 at low @xmath0 shows  [ 6 ] that , in our case , @xmath32@xmath15 , which is more than a factor of two smaller than @xmath28 .",
    "the difference between @xmath30 and @xmath28 in our samples is attributed to a larger amount of disorder .",
    "the root - mean - square ( rms ) fluctuations @xmath33 ( calculated over the frequency bandwidth from ( 10 hours)@xmath34 to ( 6 seconds)@xmath34 ) increase with @xmath0 , ranging between @xmath35 at all @xmath17 .",
    "2 ( left ) shows the relative rms , @xmath36 , as a function of @xmath0 at three different @xmath17 .",
    "while fluctuations seem to be independent of density at high @xmath0 , a dramatic increase of @xmath36 is observed with decreasing @xmath0 below @xmath37@xmath15 . even though an increase in @xmath17 causes a substantial reduction of @xmath36",
    ", the onset of large fluctuations does not seem to depend on temperature .",
    "the noise was studied in more detail using normalized power spectra @xmath38 , most of which were obtained in the @xmath39  hz bandwidth .",
    "they were found to follow the well - known power - law frequency dependence @xmath40 ( hooge s law ) [ 7 ] . in all measurements",
    ", the device noise was extracted from the total measured noise by subtracting the background noise present with no current flowing , _ i.  e. _ by setting @xmath41 .",
    "the power spectrum of the background noise was always several orders of magnitude smaller than sample noise and had no @xmath42-dependence ( white noise ) .",
    "2 ( center ) shows @xmath43 as a function of @xmath0 at @xmath44  hz and @xmath45 . at high @xmath0 ,",
    "@xmath43 does not depend on @xmath0 within the scatter of data . for @xmath46 , however , an exponential rise of @xmath43 by six orders of magnitude is observed with decreasing @xmath0 .",
    "this striking increase of the slow dynamic contribution to @xmath6 is consistent with the behavior of @xmath36 ( fig .",
    "2 , left ) .",
    "in fact , since @xmath47 , it is clear that the observed enormous increase of the relative rms as @xmath0 is reduced below @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "2 , left ) reflects a dramatic slowing down of the electron dynamics .",
    "this is attributed to the freezing of the electron glass .",
    "2 ( right ) shows another striking feature of our data .",
    "the exponent @xmath3 , which describes the frequency dependence of the noise power @xmath40 , exhibits a sudden jump at @xmath48 . while @xmath49 for @xmath50 , @xmath51 for @xmath46 ; similar large exponents @xmath3 have been observed in metallic spin glasses [ 8 ] .",
    "in general , it is possible to obtain such high values of @xmath3 if telegraph noise is superimposed on flicker ( @xmath52 ) noise  [ 9 ] .",
    "however , our data exhibit many abrupt jumps rather than two - level switching ( see fig . 1 , left ) .    for @xmath46 , a rapid _ decrease _ of @xmath43",
    "is also observed with increasing @xmath17 ( inset to fig .",
    "2 , center ) , consistent with other studies on si mosfets  [ 10 ] at higher @xmath17 ( @xmath53  k ) .",
    "the observed @xmath17-dependence of noise disagrees with the models of thermally activated charge trapping - detrapping fluctuations  [ 9,11,12 ] , noise generated by temperature fluctuations  [ 13 ] , and in the vicinity of the anderson transition  [ 14 ] , all of which predict an _ increase _ of noise with increasing @xmath17 .",
    "models of noise in the hopping regime  [ 15 ] predict either a @xmath17-independent noise or a power - law decrease of noise with @xmath17 . in our experiment",
    ", however , @xmath43 follows an exponential rather than power - law @xmath17-dependence . on the other hand ,",
    "the observed @xmath54 does agree with the behavior found in mesoscopic spin glasses  [ 16,8,17 ] .",
    "measurements of the time dependence of @xmath6 in low - mobility si mosfets have shown that , with decreasing @xmath0 , a sudden , enormous increase in the low - frequency conductivity noise and a sudden shift of the spectral weight towards lower frequencies occur at a well - defined density @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , a dramatic increase of noise with decreasing @xmath17 have been observed for @xmath46 .",
    "similar behavior in metallic spin glasses was attributed to spin glass freezing [ 16,8,17 ] . for @xmath55 ,",
    "we have also observed long relaxation times and history dependent behavior characteristic of a glassy phase , but these effects will be described in detail elsewhere .",
    "these observations are interpreted as signatures of the freezing of the electron glass at @xmath56 .",
    "the metal - insulator transition occurs at the density @xmath57 indicating the existence of a metallic electron glass , as predicted in  [ 18 ] .",
