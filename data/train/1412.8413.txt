    "the proton is one of the very few stable hadrons .",
    "it has a complicated extended structure , being a bound state of three valence quarks , a quark - antiquark sea , and glue .",
    "since the valence quarks constitute just a few percent of the proton s mass it is evident that the bulk of the proton s structure and properties are dominated by strong interactions and , correspondingly , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "the goal is then to calculate the proton s properties .    to do this we observe that the proton , and in general all baryons , appear as poles in the full six - quark green function , distinguishable by their quantum numbers .",
    "since the generation of a pole precludes perturbation theory , we are left with just a few non - perturbative tools .",
    "one possibility is lattice qcd , which provides for a numerical simulation of the problem on discrete euclidean spacetime .",
    "another method is that of functional methods , in particular the dyson  schwinger , bethe ",
    "salpeter and faddeev approach considered here . in the following",
    "we discuss a selection of results for nucleon and @xmath0 electromagnetic form factors as well as @xmath1 transition form factors .",
    "the relativistic description of bound states requires as input the propagators of the constituents , in this case the quarks .",
    "the full quark propagator @xmath2 is obtained by solving its dyson  schwinger equation ( dse ) @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the ( renormalized ) bare propagator @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are renormalisation constants , and @xmath8 is the bare quark mass provided as a parameter .",
    "its solution requires the full quark - gluon vertex @xmath9 and the gluon propagator @xmath10 .",
    "we make use of the rainbow - ladder ( rl ) approximation where the quark - gluon vertex is replaced by its bare form @xmath11 .",
    "the corresponding chiral - symmetry preserving quark - quark kernel takes the form @xmath12 d_{\\mu\\nu}(k)\\ , . \\ ] ]        employing a compact matrix notation that implies an integration over continuous variables , the faddeev equation is the permuted sum of two - body quark - quark kernels @xmath13 and an irreducible three - body kernel  @xcite : @xmath14 \\,g_0\\,\\psi + \\sum_{a=1}^3         \\big[k^{\\mathrm{2-body}}\\big]_{(a)}\\,g_0\\,\\psi\\ , . \\ ] ] here , @xmath15 is an index that labels the spectator quark and @xmath16 is the disconnected product of three full quark propagators @xmath17 .",
    "the three - body kernel does not survive the rl truncation , and so we refer to @xmath13 as @xmath18 .",
    "the conserved current that describes the interaction of a three - quark system with a single photon is given by @xmath19 where the incoming and outgoing baryon is described by the covariant faddeev amplitudes @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "@xmath22 is a shorthand notation for the impulse - approximation diagrams @xmath23 with @xmath24 the nonperturbative quark - photon vertex .",
    "@xmath25 represents the interaction of the photon with the faddeev kernel ; the only diagrams that survive in rl are those where the two - body kernel is a spectator : @xmath26 the quark - photon vertex is obtained by solving its vertex bse  @xcite .",
    "the faddeev amplitudes including their full dirac  flavor structure are , in turn , calculated from the three - body faddeev equation with the interaction kernel @xmath18 .     and",
    "@xmath27 for the proton ( left panels ) and neutron ( right panels ) compared to experimental data ; see  @xcite for references.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]     electromagnetic form factors compared to lattice results ; see  @xcite for references.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]     transition form factors compared to experimental data ; see  @xcite for references . the upper left panel shows @xmath28 and the lower panels the ratios @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the upper right panel is the result of an @xmath31wave only calculation for @xmath29 .",
    "the dashed lines refer to the central value of the quark - gluon interaction model . ]",
    "the electromagnetic currents that we discuss here are parametrized through dimensionless , lorentz - invariant form factors ( ffs ) .",
    "the nucleon s electromagnetic current depends on the two sachs ffs @xmath32 and @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath0 electromagnetic ffs are @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 : electric monopole , magnetic dipole , electric quadrupole and magnetic octupole .",
    "the @xmath1 transition ffs are usually discussed in terms of the magnetic dipole @xmath37 and the electric and coulomb quadrupole ratios @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "our results for the @xmath38 and @xmath0 electromagnetic ffs are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : nucleon - ffs ] and  [ fig : delta - ffs ] .",
    "details about the calculations can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite ; see also  @xcite for results on axial ffs . in fig .",
    "[ fig : nucleon - delta - ffs ] we present first results for the @xmath1 transition ffs in the three - body faddeev approach .",
    "the comparison with experimental data and lattice results performs rather well in all cases .",
    "this is quite remarkable given that the only model input in all calculations is the quark - gluon interaction in eq .  , with the model dependence indicated by the bands in figs .",
    "[ fig : nucleon - ffs ] and  [ fig : nucleon - delta - ffs ] . to some extent",
    "this can be attributed to the global symmetries of qcd , including its pattern of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , which are respected in every step of these calculations .",
    "for example , charge conservation at @xmath39 is not imposed by hand but rather a consequence of the underlying ward - takahashi identities .    on the other hand ,",
    "the absence of structure is visible at low @xmath40 , in particular for the magnetic form factors .",
    "these are symptoms of missing meson - cloud effects , which would enhance magnetic moments and charge radii close to the chiral limit and produce cusp effects in @xmath0 form factors due to the @xmath41 decay .",
    "a rl truncation does not support this ; it produces stable bound states that are stripped from their pion cloud and do not decay . the comparison in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta - ffs ] is illuminating in this regard : the @xmath0 calculated in lattice qcd is a bound state at unphysical pion masses , below @xmath42 threshold . when plotted as a function of @xmath43 , the lattice results for different pion masses fall into relatively narrow bands that agree well with the faddeev calculation .",
    "the importance of pion - cloud effects has also been stressed in the context of the @xmath1 transition , because the ratio @xmath29 is sensitive to orbital angular momentum in the @xmath38 and @xmath0 wave functions  @xcite .",
    "the covariant faddeev amplitude @xmath44 of the @xmath0 obtained from eq .   has a rich structure in terms of 128 dirac tensors .",
    "only four of them are @xmath45 waves in the @xmath0 rest frame and resemble the ` orbital ground - state ' wave functions in the quark model .",
    "the remaining ones are relativistic @xmath46 waves and provide orbital angular momentum , together with further @xmath47 and @xmath48 waves whose effect is much smaller  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the nucleon s faddeev amplitude has 64 dirac structures that can be arranged in @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 waves  @xcite .",
    "these higher tensor structures in the @xmath0 are presumably also the culprit for the noisy behavior in @xmath29 that is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : nucleon - delta - ffs ] . in any case , if only the @xmath31wave components are retained ( upper right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : nucleon - delta - ffs ] ) , the ratio @xmath29 rises sharply towards the asymptotic prediction @xmath49 . that this behavior is not seen in the experimental data ( which remain negative up to the highest data point at 6 gev@xmath50  @xcite ) is perhaps not too surprising since analogous arguments predict @xmath51 for the proton , whereas experiments show a clear falloff with a possible zero crossing  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath52wave admixture in a realistic faddeev amplitude generated by the rl truncation produces a similar falloff in @xmath53  @xcite , together with the negative value for @xmath29 in fig .",
    "[ fig : nucleon - delta - ffs ] .",
    "finally , we note that similar results for these ffs have been obtained in the quark - diquark approach of refs .",
    "@xcite , and to some degree also in simpler quark - diquark models  @xcite .",
    "although the three - body faddeev equation in eq .   carries no trace of diquarks by itself , this adds support to the quark - diquark interpretation for these lowest - lying baryons",
    ". it will be interesting to see whether the picture changes appreciably beyond the rainbow - ladder approximation  @xcite .",
