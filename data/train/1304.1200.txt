    "low collisionality of the solar wind ( sw ) and persistent activity of waves and turbulence make kinetic wave - particle interactions unavoidable in the sw modeling . the need for such kinetics has been emphasized in view of numerous non - thermal features observed in velocity distribution functions ( vdfs ) of the solar wind particles ( see and references therein ) . in particular , nonthermal tails , beams , and temperature anisotropies are routinely observed in situ by satellites .",
    "recent in - situ measurements have revealed that the sw turbulence at proton kinetic scales is dominated by alfvnic waves ( aws ) rather than the fast mode or whistler waves ( , @xcite ; ) .",
    "furthermore , among alfvn waves , the most power , about 80% , was found in oblique quasi - perpendicular aws , and the rest 20% in the quasi - parallel ion - cyclotron alfvn waves ( icaw ) @xcite .",
    "properties of quasi - parallel icaws are understood much better than that of the oblique aws at proton kinetic scales .",
    "icaws experience strong ion - cyclotron resonances and are considered as a main source for the perpendicular heating of the protons and heavier ions in the solar corona and solar wind ( see reviews by , and references therein ) .",
    "properties of the dominant quasi - perpendicular aw fraction and its influence on particles vdfs are still unclear . depending on the wavevector anisotropy @xmath3 ( perpendicular / parallel with respect to the mean magnetic field @xmath4 ) , less oblique aws at proton kinetic scales are similar to icaws , while more oblique aws are kinetic alfvn waves ( kaws ) . at intermediate @xmath5 ,",
    "aws possess mixed properties of both icaws and kaws and can be named ion - cyclotron kaws - ickaws @xcite .",
    "since ickaws experience both the ion - cyclotron resonance ( typical for icaws ) and the cherenkov resonance ( typical for kaws ) , they have more dissipation and generation channels and can play an important role in the energy exchange between parallel and perpendicular degrees of freedom in the solar wind .    the wavevector anisotropy at proton kinetic scales has been measured by . for perpendicular wave numbers up to @xmath6",
    ", the wave / proton - cyclotron frequency ratio appeared to be still low , @xmath7 , whereas the anisotropy is high , about @xmath8 , which is typical for classic kaws .",
    "the dominant role of kaws in the oblique aw fraction has been supported further by two independent tests performed by , who measured simultaneously two polarization ratios : compressional magnetic / total magnetic and total electric / total magnetic field perturbations .",
    "the interest in kaws and related issues has risen recently in the context of turbulence dissipation in the solar wind and consequent heating of plasma species (; ; and references therein ) . suggested that the mhd aw turbulence cascades along a critical balance path , which result in preferential generation of high perpendicular wavenumbers , and hence kaws @xcite .",
    "an indirect confirmation of the critical balance was received recently by , who proved that the critical balance leads to generation of the residual energy observed in the solar wind turbulence .",
    "a solar wind model elaborating landau damping of kaws has predicted the electron and proton heating rates @xcite , which agree well with empirical estimations by at @xmath9 au . at smaller radial distances",
    "the proton heating by landau damping appeared to be insufficient and howes ( 2011 ) suggested the proton cyclotron heating operating there .",
    "because of the shorter inertial range , the mhd turbulence at shorter radial distances ends up with less anisotropic fluctuations at proton kinetic scales , which can produce the required proton heating via cyclotron resonant interaction .",
    "a widely used assumption of the maxwellian landau damping can be violated in the solar wind by local deformations of vdfs of particles in resonant velocity ranges .",
    "have demonstrated that the electron landau damping is still strong ( although not maxwellian any more ) because the relatively high collisionality of the electron is capable of keeping their vdfs not far from maxwellian . on the contrary , the less collisional protons",
    "experience much stronger departures from maxwellian vdfs , which can significantly modify the proton landau damping , or even cancel it .",
    "proposed another promising heating mechanism for the protons , stochastic acceleration by kaws across @xmath4 .",
    "this mechanism is not related to the kinetic wave - particle resonances , and is therefore not so sensitive to the local deformations of the proton vdfs .",
    "if the turbulence at proton kinetic scales consists of the ion - cyclotron and kaw fractions , as is suggested by recent observations , both these fractions should produce their own observed signatures - specific features in the proton vdfs .",
    "the most typical observed features of the proton vdfs are @xcite : ( i ) nonthermal tails or even secondary peaks along the magnetic field direction in all solar wind types ( fast , slow , and intermediate ) , and ( ii ) total temperature anisotropies @xmath10  in the fast solar wind ( with anisotropic proton cores ) , and @xmath11  in the slow ( with isotropic cores ) and intermediate ( with both isotropic and anisotropic cores ) solar winds . the parallel proton tails and beams are important contributors to the energy balance between parallel and perpendicular degrees of freedom . in the fast solar wind",
    "they reduce the total temperature anisotropy to @xmath12  ( and at times even reverse to @xmath13 ) despite the strongly  anisotropic cores of the proton vdfs , @xmath14  @xmath15 ( see figure 8.4 by marsch , 1991 ) . in the intermediate and slow solar wind",
    "they dominate the energy balance making @xmath16 . among them",
    ", the nonthermal tails prevail @xcite .",
    "the secondary peaks ( bumps - on - tails ) are less frequent and develop on the tail background mainly in the fast solar wind .",
    "therefore the bump - on - tail seems to be a later evolution stage of the proton vdf as compared to the tail . at the same time , persistent nonthermal tails without bumps are observed at all distances , which suggest that the bumps are not necessary developing on the tails within the solar wind expansion time - scale ; their development is therefore somehow constrained or require more time .",
    "the anisotropic cores of the proton vdfs with @xmath17  have been associated with the ion - cyclotron heating by ion - cyclotron resonant waves , and icaws interaction with solar wind protons and heavier ions have been studied extensively (; ; and references therein ) .",
    "it was in particular shown that the ion - cyclotron pitch - angle diffusion can be responsible for the shaping and perpendicular heating of the core proton vdfs @xcite , for the cross - field heating of heavier ions @xcite , and also for the pitch - angle scattering of the nonthermal proton tails @xcite .",
    "wave mechanisms producing nonthermal proton tails and bumps - on - tails ( beams ) in the solar wind received much less attention .",
    "the first one , proposed by , relied upon the proton cyclotron - resonant diffusion driven by a specific ion - cyclotron mode supported by helium ions .",
    "another mechanism , nonlinear proton trapping in the parallel kaw potentials , has been suggested by .",
    "later on , analytical @xcite and numerical @xcite studies have confirmed that a kaw with reasonable amplitude can produce observed proton beams in the solar wind conditions .",
    "proton trapping and beam generation can also be produced by electrostatic waves carrying parallel electric fields .",
    "recent simulations of the nonlinear decay of circularly polarized alfvn waves have demonstrated that the product electrostatic waves can trap and accelerate protons along @xmath4 , thereby creating a beam @xcite .",
    "ion - acoustic waves @xcite and `` ion - bulk '' waves @xcite have been discussed as mediators transferring energy from aws to plasma particles . alternatively , used a quasilinear approach to study the proton diffusion driven by a strongly dispersive kaw spectrum .",
    "this process can produce a quasilinear plateau in the form of nonthermal tail in the proton vdf .",
    "earlier kinetic models of the sw electrons , accounting for the influence of external macroscopic forces and coulomb collisions @xcite , have been recently improved by the inclusion of terms due to whistler turbulence @xcite . it was concluded that the whistler turbulence , if exists in the solar wind , could lead to the velocity - space diffusion of electrons and form nonthermal tails in the electron vdf .",
    "another source for the velocity - space electron diffusion has been studied by , who assumed a spectrum of kinetic alfvn waves ( kaws ) instead of whistlers .",
    "moreover , argued that the nonlinear kaw scattering off electrons is more efficient than the nonlinear wave - wave interaction in the short - wavelength kaw range .    in the present paper",
    "we study the influence of the observed kinetic - scale turbulence on the evolution of the proton vdf .",
    "first we derive the fokker - planck diffusion terms for protons under the action of alfvnic turbulence .",
    "we are interested here in the influence of the kaw component , which is dominant in the kinetic - scale sw turbulence , on the evolution of the proton vdf .",
    "the fokker - planck diffusion coefficients are presented in terms of quantities measured in - situ in the solar wind . in particular",

    "such tails one needs to solve a nonlocal problem incorporating radial dependencies of the solar wind plasma and turbulence characteristics ( this work is in progress ) . again , even for such long tails as @xmath241 , the problem can be made local with slightly increased turbulence amplitudes and/or spectral break wavenumbers , say to @xmath244 and @xmath245 .",

    "in addition , as we will see below , the decrease of the spectral slope @xmath168 ( with fixed amplitude @xmath246 ) has the same effect .",
    "since the plateau formation time given by equation ( [ tv ] ) is quite complex function of plasma and turbulence parameters , its radial dependence require further investigations using particular plasma and turbulence models .",

    "it is nevertheless interesting to estimate a nonthermal proton tail that could result from a turbulence measured by cluster .    in a particular case of cluster measurements 10",

    ".    the dependence @xmath256 for this case is given by the bottom line in figure 4 .",
    "one can observe that the turbulence should generate a nonthermal proton tail with @xmath288 at 1 au .",
    "the proton vdf could not be measured by cluster , but the average parallel energy of the protons was found to be larger than the perpendicular one , producing the effective temperature anisotropy @xmath289 .",
    "this anisotropy can not be produced by the quasilinear evolution of the initially isotropic maxwellian vdf in the velocity range from @xmath0 to @xmath290 .",
    "to obtain such anisotropy , one needs either more protons in the tail , or longer tail ( @xmath291 ) , or both .",
    "the additional protons can be delivered to the tail by the nonlinear broadening of the cherenkov resonance at @xmath203 , as is given by equation ( [ vmin ] ) , and/or by the enhanced collisional diffusion at the steep velocity - space gradients at @xmath292 , where vdf undergoes a sharp transition from the maxwellial vdf to the plateau - like .",
    "most probably , both these processes have non - negligible effects on the tail density , and act synergetically .",
    "again , we would like to stress that the tail length is not much affected by these processes .",
    "the longer tail could only be generated at shorter radial distances to the sun , in more favorable conditions .",
    "we studied a fokker - planck proton diffusion in the solar wind induced by alfvnic turbulence observed recently at proton kinetic scales (;",
    ", @xcite ; ; ) .",
    "observations indicate that the turbulence is anisotropic and dominated by large perpendicular wavevectors , which is typical for kaws possessing parallel electric fields and hence experiencing cherenkov resonances . in the presence of a wide kaw spectrum with overlapping harmonics ,",
    "the protons undergo numerous cherenkov kicks resulting in a fokker - planck proton diffusion in the velocity space along the mean magnetic field .",
    "we derived a quasilinear diffusion equation with the diffusion coefficient expressed in terms of measured turbulence parameters : spectral break wavenumber @xmath171 , turbulence amplitude @xmath148 at the spectral break , and spectral slopes @xmath168 below the break . at small and large @xmath35 ,",
    "the asymptotic values for the spectral index are @xmath293 and @xmath294 , respectively ( _ e.g. _ ) .",
    "there is however an intermediate spectral range , @xmath295 , where the spectrum slope is variable and often steepens to @xmath296 or even higher values @xcite .",
    "the turbulence power at these scales is mostly in form of weakly / mildy dispersive kaws that are cherenkov - resonant with protons in the velocity range covered by observed nonthermal tails , @xmath297 .",
    "enhanced nonlinear interaction among kaws can explain such steep spectra in this range ( voitenko and de keyser , 2011 ) , but resonant generation of nonthermal tails can contribute to the steepening as well .",
    "on the other hand , an additional source for the kaw replenishing in the dissipation range can be provided by the non - local nonlinear coupling among kaws and large - scale mhd aws @xcite .    applied an asymptotic analysis to study the quasilinear proton diffusion in the strongly dispersive kaw turbulence with @xmath136 , which implies relatively high - energy resonant protons with @xmath298 .",
    "however , such asymptotical analysis is inapplicable to typical tails with proton velocities @xmath196 .",
    "the reason is that the kaw phase velocity ( equation ( [ disbeta ] ) ) can not be approximated by a simple power - law dependence in the resonant wavenumber range @xmath299 .",
    "we focused on this tail - resonant range , where most of kinetic - scale power is residing and where the full kaw dispersion ( equatiion ( [ disbeta ] ) ) has to be used .",
    "consequently , the resulting diffusion equation is more complex and does not have an immediate analytical solution similar to that found by . to proceed further analytically , we took into account a fast decrease of the diffusion coefficient with growing @xmath161 ( see figure 2 ) , which allowed us to formulate a simple yet plausible model for the quasilinear plateau , equations ( [ npl ] ) and ( [ npl ] ) , with the time - dependent front velocity @xmath190 and height @xmath221 . by the use of this model in the diffusion equation ( equations ( [ deq ] ) and ( [ d3 ] ) )",
    ", we found an analytical solution ( equation ( [ tv ] ) ) for the plateau formation time as function of the plateau front velocity @xmath190 .",
    "several numerical tests ( one of them is shown in figure 3 ) have confirmed the applicability of this model in the solar wind conditions .",
    "in general , our analysis and numerical estimations have revealed that the quasilinear proton diffusion driven by the observed solar wind turbulence provides a robust generation mechanism for nonthermal proton tails , which can explain their routine observations in the solar wind . by implementing the measured characteristics of the turbulence at proton kinetic scales @xmath300 @xmath148 , and @xmath168 in our model , we estimated the time scale of the quasilinear plateau formation in the velocity space . for typical nonthermal tails with @xmath301",
    "the estimated formation time is @xmath302 h , which is much less than the solar wind expansion time at 1 au .",
    "this indicates that the local generation of such tails observed in the solar wind is a natural consequence of the observed kinetic - scale alfvn turbulence .",
    "some longer tails may require more time to develop , in which case a non - local radially - dependent problem has to be solved numerically using suitable solar wind models . in principle , with sufficient kaw power at @xmath303 ,",
    "the quasilinear plateau can extend well above @xmath191 , where an asymptotic @xmath136 analysis by is applicable .",
    "however , the turbulence level is usually insufficient to form the tails with @xmath304 within required time scales , which is reflected in the fast growth of the formation time beyond @xmath236 .",
    "this constrain is compatible with rare observations of such long tails .",
    "the most favorable conditions for the tail generation in terms of @xmath267 occur in the range @xmath305 for spectral slopes ranging from @xmath2542.5 to 4 , correspondingly .",
    "the optimal @xmath306 is not much varying with the spectral slopes in the range of interest , and we can say that in general @xmath307 .",
    "such conditions are often met at 1 au . as is seen from figure 5 , the range of @xmath267 allowing for the tail generation",
    "has two bounds , upper @xmath308 and lower @xmath309 .",
    "the upper bound @xmath308 is relatively large , its values for different spectral slopes are very scattered , and it is not very restrictive for the tail generation . on the contrary ,",
    "the lower bound @xmath309 is more restrictive .",
    "it has more collimated values that are not much different from each other and are not so small , which is seen from figure 5 .",
    "say , for @xmath310 tails @xmath311 and such tails can not be generated locally if @xmath312 . the range of favorable @xmath267 can not be extended towards smaller values .",
    "it seems that only short tails with @xmath313 can be generated at @xmath314 .",
    "relatively long tails are expected with steep spectral slopes @xmath168 that are positively correlated with turbulence levels .",
    "we also analyzed a particular case reported by .",
    "we found that the measured turbulence can generate a nonthermal tail extending to @xmath288 , but the proton number density in the tail is insufficient to explain the measured temperature anisotropy of the protons .",
    "we suggest that the nonlinear resonance broadening and enhanced collisional diffusion at @xmath166 are important mechanisms significantly increasing the proton number density in the tail .",
    "yet another possibility is that the longer tail producing larger measured anisotropy was generated at shorter radial distances .",
    "the related effects require further investigation .    behind the amplitude - related constrains mentioned above",
    ", the tail length and shape can also be constrained by plasma instabilities .",
    "several instabilities can develop on the plateau - like proton tail , including the fast magnetosonic , parallel alfvn - cyclotron @xcite , and oblique alfvn @xcite instabilities .",
    "although and studied instability driven by the bump - on - tail , its generation mechanism is related to the anomalous doppler ( proton - cyclotron ) resonance rather than the inverse landau damping , and hence is not restricted to the bump - on - tail but can also be efficient with plateau - like distributions .",
    "the cyclotron diffusion of tail protons , driven by these instabilities , can constrain tail lengths and produce proton - cyclotron quasilinear plateau reported by and , or even produce the bump - on - tail features . in turn , the nonthermal proton tails and beams can re - emit kaws @xcite and significantly modify the nonlinear evolution of the high - amplitude circularly - polarised alfvn waves ( , @xcite ) . a complex interplay of these processes",
    "requires further investigations",
    ".    obtained analytical expressions for the proton diffusion coefficient can be incorporated in more sophisticated solar wind models accounting for external forces ( electric and gravity ) , and both the particle - particle ( coulomb ) and the wave - particle ( cherenkov ) interaction terms in the right - hand side of equation ( [ vlasov ] ) . because of their complexity , such models need to be solved numerically .",
    "our preliminary simulation results demonstrate that the kinetic - scale alfvnic turbulence can create such nonthermal tails in the proton vdfs at the radial distances @xmath315 solar radii ( see detailed descriptions of these simulations in our accompanying paper @xcite ) .",
    "we did not concern here the bump - on - tail features ( proton beams ) often observed in the solar wind .",
    "such distributions have not been reproduced by the uniform quasilinear diffusion we studied . however , with variable level of the turbulence launched through the solar wind base , the irregularity of the generated tail length can easily produce the bump - on - tail features by the time - of - flight effect .",
    "namely , in a region of enhanced turbulence the high - velocity end of a dense nonthermal tail propagates faster than the bulk protons . as a consequence , at larger radial distances",
    "this proton population penetrates a more quiet region with a weaker tail and appears there as a bump on tail .",
    "this mechanism is compatible with helios observations of time - variable bumps on virtually persistent tails @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , appearance of nonthermal proton tails and beams in the solar wind is unavoidable in the presence of kinetic - scale alfvnic turbulence with sufficient amplitude .",
    "there are several other generation mechanisms for proton beams and tails ( see introduction ) , which can compete with each other or replace in varying solar wind conditions .",
    "more detailed statistical correlation studies are needed to discriminate among them and to find what mechanism is dominant in the solar wind .",
    "it would be particularly interesting to have a look at correlations between the tail lengths and/or densities and the turbulence levels at kinetic scales .",
    "this research was supported by the belgian federal science policy office ( via iap programme , project p7/08 charm ) and by the european commission s fp7 program ( projects 263340 swiff , and 313038 storm ) .",
