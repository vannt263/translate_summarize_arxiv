    "the generated left electron asymmetry results in change of the primordial right electron asymmetry @xmath247 and influences the bau evolution .    for large scales of hypermagnetic field ( for a smaller value @xmath183 ) , sphaleron transitions are more efficient to erase bau since the amplitude of a competitive mean hypercharge field decreases [ when amplitude @xmath141 goes down ] , and therefore due to abelian anomalies ,",
    "an enhancement of the lepton number ceases .",
    "of course , the bigger the seed hypermagnetic field @xmath248 , the bigger the lepton asymmetries and the baryon one .    while our choice of cs wave",
    "as the simplest hypermagnetic field configuration significantly simplifies the analysis of the lepton ( baryon ) asymmetry evolution , we should comment on some disadvantages that are appropriate to such hypercharge field .",
    "first , a scale of hypermagnetic field for the chosen cs configuration is rather small . in order to get the bau close to the observable value @xmath249 we fit the cs wave number of the order of @xmath250 , where @xmath251 corresponds to the maximum wave number for the hypermagnetic field surviving ohmic losses at ewpt time .",
    "the macroscopic long - range hypercharge field has the scale @xmath207 , which is much bigger than the mean distance between particles in plasma @xmath252 , and , on the other hand , is much less than the horizon size @xmath253 . here",
    "the horizon size , e.g. , at the ewpt time @xmath254 , is much bigger than the scales @xmath255 and @xmath256 applied in our plots . because of the arbitrariness of the @xmath257-axis direction chosen for the cs wave , such macroscopic fields are rather small - scale ( random ) fields and there is no anisotropy of medium .",
    "thus , in order to get a necessary scale on the onset of galactic magnetic fields we should rely on an inverse cascade evolving after the ewpt for the maxwellian fields  @xcite that originated from the hypercharge ones in our causal scenario . note that such inverse cascade needs a significant amount of magnetic helicity in order to operate efficiently . for the cs wave",

    "in other words , the lower @xmath183 , the further away the cs wave configuration is from the maximum helical field obeying the relation @xmath260 .",
    "this circumstance should be taken into account for a more realistic continuous hypercharge field spectrum when the conservation of the global helicity governs a spread of helicities over different scales .",
    "in addition , our choice of cs wave does not appear to be not realistic for transition of hypercharge field to the maxwellian one during ewpt .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that being provided by the helicity conservation only a helical field such as that given by the 3d configuration of @xmath4 can penetrate the boundary wall separating symmetric and broken phases during the ewpt time @xmath261 .",
