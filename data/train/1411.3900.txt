    "the recent detection of unusual radio pulses @xcite , known as fast radio bursts ( frbs ) , has generated strong interest in identifying their origin and nature .",
    "the bursts exhibit a frequency - dependent time delay , which obeys a quadratic form so strictly , that the only explanation remains - signal dispersion in cold cosmic plasma during propagation .",
    "the magnitude of this delay , proportional to the electron column density along the line of sight , and called dispersion measure , is so large that the cosmological distances are inferred for the sources .",
    "thornton _ et al _",
    "@xcite deduce redshifts for four different frbs observed at parkes radio telescope to be in the range from 0.45 to 0.96 .",
    "recently detected frb at arecibo observatory @xcite ( which has larger size antenna and therefore excludes atmospheric artefacts as possibility for frb ) has derived redshift of @xmath1 .",
    "all observers agree on a high rate of frbs , @xmath2 events / day for the whole sky .",
    "frbs are also characterized by extremely high flux densities ( @xmath3 jy ) over very short time scales ( milliseconds ) .",
    "short time scales imply that the size of emitting region is small , less then @xmath4 km .",
    "observed fluxes imply that the total energy radiated in the band of observation was in the range @xmath5 ergs @xcite , assuming isotropy and quoted redshifts .",
    "derived redshifts , and therefore the radiated energy , can be smaller if significant part of dispersion measure accumulates in the host galaxies .",
    "with this parameters , and assuming frbs are at gpc distances , their brightness temperature would be @xmath6 , leading to the conclusion that radiation from frb sources should be coherent @xcite .",
    "the source of the frb signals is hotly debated in the literature , with suggested progenitors ranging from terrestrial interference to neutron star - neutron star mergers .",
    "wide range of models was thoroughly discussed in kulkarni _",
    "@xcite , and refs . therein .",
    "while all models have problems , the verdict was that several arguments @xcite , which relate giant flares of young magnetars with frbs , may offer plausible physical scenario @xcite based on assumption that frbs could be attributed to synchrotron maser emission from relativistic , magnetized shocks .",
    "frbs are so mysterious that a new physics models were also suggested and discussed in literature @xcite-@xcite .",
    "e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite even discussed , _ en route _ , the possibility that frbs are signals beamed at earth by advanced civilizations .    in this paper",
    "i consider possible relation of frbs and axions  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was suggested that axion field may form gravitationally bound compact astrophysical objects , where under some conditions parametric instability occurs , resulting in a powerful coherent burst of maser radiation .",
    "such instability has been also studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "i reconsider this scenario and discuss several mechanisms where axion miniclusters @xcite are responsible for fast radio bursts , see also  @xcite .",
    "i d like to note , that a general case of axion like particles ( alp , where particle mass , self coupling , and coupling to electromagnetic field are not tightly related to each other ) , opens a lot of possibilities which are ruled out otherwise .",
    "i do not consider general case of alp , staying instead with the standard qcd invisible axion model .",
    "generalization to alp is straightforward .",
    "the invisible axion is among the best motivated candidates for cosmic dark matter  @xcite .",
    "the axion is the pseudo - nambu ",
    "goldstone boson resulting from the spontaneous breaking of a @xmath7 global symmetry known as the peccei ",
    "quinn , or pq , symmetry introduced to explain the apparent smallness of strong cp - violation in qcd @xcite .",
    "there are stringent astrophysical , cosmological , and laboratory constraints on the properties of the axion  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the combination of cosmological and astrophysical considerations restricts the axion mass @xmath8 to be in the window @xmath9",
    ". corresponding value of the axion decay constant @xmath10 can be found using relation @xmath11 , where @xmath12 referes to pion .",
    "the contribution to the mean density of the universe from axions in this window is guaranteed to be cosmologically significant .",
    "thus , if axions exist , they will be dynamically important in the present evolution of the universe .",
    "for what follows , it is important for pq - symmetry to be restored after inflationary stage of the universe evolution",
    ". this happens if reheating temperature is larger than the corresponding pq - scale , but this may also happen  @xcite already during reheating , in a transient highly non - equilibrium state , even if resulting temperature is small .",
    "in this situation the axion field takes different values in different casually disconnected regions at temperatures well above the qcd confinement , when the axion is effectively massless . at the confinement temperature and below",
    ", qcd effects produce a potential for the axion of the form @xmath13 $ ] , where the axion field was parametrized as a dimensionless angular variable @xmath14 .",
    "axion oscillations commence and field variations are transformed into density contrasts , @xmath15 , which later lead to tiny gravitationally bound `` miniclusters '' .",
    "since density variations in this circumstances are large from the very beginning , we do not refer to them as `` perturbations '' , and let us call corresponding regions as `` clumps '' .",
    "it is easy to understand that today those clumps , or miniclusters , will be very dense objects .",
    "let us specify the density of a dark - matter clump prior to matter - radiation equality as @xmath16 . in situation when @xmath17 ( which would arise for non - interacting field @xmath18 with random initial conditions ) , these clumps separate from cosmological expansion and form gravitationally bound objects already at @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the temperature of equal matter and radiation energy densities .",
    "density of such clump today will correspond to a matter density back then , i.e. will be @xmath21 times larger than the local galactic halo dark matter density",
    ".    however , at the time when axion oscillations commence , in many regions @xmath22 , and self - interaction is important .",
    "numerical investigation of the dynamics of the axion field around the qcd epoch @xcite had shown that the non - linear effects result in regions with @xmath23 much larger than unity , possibly as large as several hundred , leading to enormous minicluster densities .",
    "in such situation a clump separates from cosmological expansion at @xmath24 which leads to a final minicluster density today given by @xcite @xmath25 even a relatively small increase in @xmath23 is important because the final density depends upon @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "the scale of minicluster masses is set by the total mass in axions within the hubble radius at a temperature around @xmath28 gev when axion oscillations commence , which is about @xmath29 .",
    "masses of miniclusters are relatively insensitive to the particular value of @xmath23 associated with the minicluster",
    ". corresponding minicluster radius as a function of @xmath30 and @xmath23 : @xmath31 since large-@xmath23 miniclusters are very dense , form early , and are well separated from each other , they should escape tidal disruption and merging .    according to ref .",
    "@xcite , more than 13% of all axionic dark matter are in miniclusters with @xmath32 , more than about 20% are in miniclusters with @xmath33 and 70% are in miniclusters @xmath34 .",
    "since roughly half of all axions reside in miniclusters , the total number of miniclusters in the galaxy is large , @xmath35 .    at this point , an important relation @xmath36 and",
    "the fact that gigahertz frequency radiation is within allowed axion mass range , @xmath37 ghz , should tell us that if a fraction of axion minicluster mass is rapidly transformed into radiation , this will lead to something similar to observed frb .",
    "interestingly , in my notes dating back to 1997 i have found the following phrase : `` even if the tiny fraction @xmath38 of the minicluster mass @xmath29 will go into radiation on this frequency , it can be detected from anywhere in the galaxy halo ( l. rosenberg , private communication ) '' .",
    "back then this ( and several uncertainness which i will describe below ) actually had prevented me from submitting already prepared paper .",
    "let us discuss farther evolution of axion miniclusters and possible mechanisms of their mass transfer into radiation .",
    "miniclusters with @xmath39 undergo the bose - condensation later on and consequently became even denser and more compact @xcite .",
    "usually , in the related literature , an existence of a bose - star is just postulated , without questioning of how it can be formed , for a review of bose - stars see , e.g.  @xcite . however , in the case of invisible axion all couplings are so small , that mere possibility of condensate formation has to be studied @xcite .",
    "simple estimates has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite , while bose - condensation in the frameworks of boltzmann equation was studied numerically in ref .  @xcite . in boltzmann approach bose - condensate",
    "does not form actually , one can see only an establishment of the kolmogorov inverse cascade towards zero momenta ( but this approach does allow to estimate formation time ) .",
    "the problem was solved in  @xcite by studying numerically the evolution of initially random classical fields , both for positive and negative self - couplings ( the later corresponds to the axion case ) .",
    "it is remarkable that in spite of the apparent smallness of axion quartic self - coupling , @xmath40 , the subsequent relaxation in an axion minicluster due to @xmath41 scattering can be significant as a consequence of the huge mean phase - space density of axions .",
    "then , instead of the classical expression , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the corresponding cross section and @xmath44 typical velocity in the gravitational well , one gets  @xcite for the relaxation time @xmath45    the relaxation time ( [ rl ] ) is smaller then the present age of the universe for miniclusters with @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "i will call resulting objects bose - clusters , not bose - stars , since their total mass is not in a stellar mass range .",
    "characteristic sizes and limiting masses of resulting objects can be estimated  @xcite analyzing simple equation of `` hydrostatic equilibrium '' in non - relativistic limit @xmath46 the pressure @xmath47 and density @xmath48 has to be understood here as quantities averaged over the period of field oscillation .    _",
    "1 . non - interacting field .",
    "_ positive contribution to the pressure comes from the field gradients , and can be approximated as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the averaged size of the configuration , and subscript `` 0 '' in what follows will mean amplitude of field oscillations .",
    "this gives @xmath51 which , depending upon axion parameters and mass of the cluster can be comparable or less then frb s emitting region .",
    "the maximum possible mass of a stable bose - cluster corresponds to @xmath52 which gives @xmath53 . for non - interacting axions",
    "this would be in the range of @xmath54 .",
    "_ 2 . positive self - coupling .",
    "_ the self - coupling may be tiny , but its contribution to the pressure , @xmath55 , can not be neglected in a certain parameter range . using this expression in eq .",
    "( [ he ] ) one finds  @xcite @xmath56 . with the positive self - coupling ( which corresponds to a repulsive interaction ) the maximum mass of a stable bose - cluster",
    "can be significantly bigger than for non - interacting particles .",
    "_ 2 . negative self - coupling . _",
    "the self - coupling of axions is negative and their interaction is attractive .",
    "consequently , there will be no - stable configuration when @xmath57 .",
    "we find that the instability develops when @xmath58 or at @xmath59 . for axions",
    "@xmath60 and this condition reduces to @xmath61 . instability condition can be also re - written as @xmath62 .    during bose - relaxation",
    "the mass of the bose - condensed core in the clump grows , while its radius shrinks .",
    "when the mass exceeds @xmath63 , the core collapses . at this moment",
    "its radius is equal to @xmath64 regardless of @xmath8 .",
    "note that the maximum mass for a stable axion bose - cluster at @xmath65 is of the order of the typical mass of the axion minicluster .",

    "there are several mechanisms by which considerable fraction of axion minicluster can be transferred into electromagnetic radiation , either for isolated cluster , or for cluster in magnetic field .",

    "maximum amplification is achieved for @xmath75 with @xmath76 ( which corresponds to axion decay @xmath68 ) , and radiation is amplified in the band @xmath77 .",
    "when incident radiation pass through the cluster , it will be amplified along the photon path .",
    "it is important that the position of the resonance , @xmath75 , does not depend upon the field amplitude , and only the @xmath78 does .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the amplification coefficient for the whole cluster , @xmath79 .",
    "if at some moment of time the condition @xmath80 is reached , the cluster will explode  @xcite .",
    "we find @xmath81 for the equilibrium bose - cluster , @xmath82 . in the axion case the cluster is in `` hydrostatic '' equilibrium",
    "when @xmath83 , therefore @xmath84 .",
    "while clusters with @xmath85 do not explode , axion decay width with respect to stimulated emission is much larger there as compared to free axions .",
    "their decay may make an excess radio background .",
    "it is intriguing to note in this respect that the extragalactic radio background measured by arcade  2  @xcite is a factor of @xmath86 brighter than the estimated contribution of resolved point sources . this excess was not explained .",
    "axionic bose - cluster can explode only after it has lost equilibrium and is collapsing .",
    "what happens next is a difficult problem , requiring numerical modeling .",
    "i can only note that during collapse the condition @xmath87 can be reached .",
    "in this regime the system is not in a `` narrow '' resonance regime anymore ( though not in a `` wide '' regime either , where explosive decay can happen regardless of time - evolving background  @xcite ) . also , quasi - stable configuration resembling `` breezers '' or `` oscillons '' may form  @xcite during collapce , which may help resonance to develop . finally , in this regime",
    "the axion field does not evolve independently , but mixes with the pion field , @xmath88 .",
    "indeed , physical pion and axion are mass eigenstates of small oscillations around the minima of the common potential ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath89 \\ , , \\label{ax - pion}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 and @xmath91 . with @xmath22",
    ", the pion field will develop too . which particle species and with what spectra will be created , and what would be the rate of corresponding explosions are interesting problems to study .",

    "we have shown that observed properties of frb s ( total energy release , duration , high brightness temperature , event rate ) can be matched in a model which assumes explosive decay of axion miniclusters .",
