    "there are lots of gravitational evidences suggesting the dominance of dark matter ( dm ) over baryonic visible matter in our universe , though little is known about its non - gravitational interaction . if dm can annihilate or decay into the standard model ( sm ) particles , gamma rays will be generated either directly or by the final state radiation , inverse compton scattering and bremsstrahlung of the final charged particles .",
    "as these gamma rays depend on the dm density as @xmath0 for annihilations and @xmath1 for decays , they might be detectable at locations with very high density of dark matter , such as the galactic center ( gc ) .",
    "recently hooper and goodenough @xcite investigated the gamma rays from the gc using the first two years of data from the fermi gamma ray space telescope .",
    "they modeled the backgrounds and found that the morphology and spectrum of the gamma rays between @xmath2 and @xmath3 from the gc can be well understood .",
    "however excess emission of gamma rays seems to be present within @xmath2 degree of the gc .",
    "this may well indicate that we have to improve our understanding on the astrophysical background .",
    "nevertheless , this additional component could also be interpreted by the dm annihilation into tau leptons , with a mass around @xmath4 gev and the annihilation cross section @xmath5s .",
    "there are also anomalous microwave emission from the inner galaxy in the wmap data @xcite which is known as the `` wmap haze '' .",
    "it was further observed by hooper and linden @xcite that , if the dm annihilates equally into @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , the wmap haze can be simultaneously accounted for by the synchrotron radiation emitted from the annihilation final state of electrons and positrons .",
    "notice that wmap haze could also be explained by astrophysical processes @xcite .",
    "coincidentally , the annual modulation effect measured by the dama / libra collaboration @xcite together with the recent results about excesses of events ( over the backgrounds ) reported by cdms - ii @xcite and cogent @xcite , if interpreted as elastically scattering dm , favor the dm mass about 5 - 10 gev @xcite .",
    "the null results from xenon100 @xcite and cdms - ii @xcite are in tension with the previous data .",
    "nevertheless , concerning the uncertainties of the dm velocity distribution @xcite and of the relative scintillation efficiency of the liquid xenon at low recoil energy @xcite , it is still possible to interpret the cogent and dama / libra observations as light dm with mass around @xmath9 gev @xcite , and at the same time , consistent with the null results of xenon100 and cdms - ii .    such a light dm is beyond the conventional paradigm of weakly - interacting massive particle ( wimp ) with the mass around @xmath10 gev to several tev , though it is certainly possible to realize this scenario in susy models , e.g. in an effective minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model @xcite .",
    "interestingly , in the wimpless models @xcite the dm particle naturally has the correct thermal relic density with a wide range of mass varying from tev down to subgev @xcite .",
    "the key observation in @xcite is that , the thermal relic density of a stable particle is proportional to @xmath11 , with @xmath12 and @xmath13 the typical mass and coupling entering the annihilation cross section .",
    "the correct thermal relic density can be easily realized for the dm particle x in the hidden sector if @xmath14 with the weak scale @xmath15 gev and @xmath16 .",
    "such relation can be satisfied for example in the gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking models if there is only one supersymmetry(susy ) breaking sector , so that the susy - breaking soft scales in both the visible sector and the hidden sector are generated by the gauge interactions with the same susy - breaking sector .    in the following",
    ", we will then study the possible implications of the above experimental results for the wimpless models .",
    "notice that we shall not attempt to explore the full parameter space of the wimpless models .",
    "instead , as illustration only benchmark models are examined in this paper .",
    "for example , following ref .",
    "@xcite , we only consider the wimpless dm annihilating democratically into @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 to interpret the wmap haze .",
    "but it is definitely possible to explain the wmap haze with other choices of parameters provided the dm can significantly annihilate into @xmath6 .",
    "nevertheless , our main conclusions should remain qualitatively unchanged for general wimpless models .",
    "phenomenologically , the wimpless dm has been used to explain the dama signal @xcite .",
    "the indirect detection of fermion wimpless dm at the neutrino telescopes icecube and deepcore has been discussed in @xcite . the low energy constraints on wimpless dm can be found in @xcite .",
    "it is also worth noting that the particle physics implications for the gamma ray excess from the gc together with cogent and dama / libra has been studied in @xcite , though in a model independent way and without the inclusion of the wmap haze .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we adopt scalar and vector wimpless models to discuss the excess gamma rays from the gc , the wmap haze and the cogent and dama results .",
    "we also investigate the low energy constraints from the anomalous magnetic moment of leptons and from some lepton flavor violating decays .",
    "we then extend the discussions to fermion wimpless models in the third section .",
    "finally we conclude with a summary in section iv .",
    "in wimpless models , to couple the dm particle x to the visible sector , yukawa like interactions including a connector sector can be introduced . to be concrete ,",
    "let s first consider the case of scalar dm which was exploited in @xcite to investigate the dama annual modulation signals .",
    "the interactions can be written as @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 denote the left - handed and right - handed standard model ( sm ) fermions , @xmath20 are the connector fields which have both hidden and sm charges . notice that @xmath20 behave just like exotic fourth generation quarks and leptons ( or squarks and sleptons ) .",
    "the direct searches at tevatron constrain the masses of the exotic fourth generation quarks to be @xmath21 gev @xcite , while the searches at lep constrain the sleptons to be heavier than @xmath22 gev @xcite . therefore the connector fields y must be much heavier than the dm particle x which is about @xmath4 gev , and in the following calculations we will take the limit of large @xmath23 . @xmath24",
    "can also be a vector field , correspondingly the interactions is @xmath25    with the above lagrangians , the dm particles can annihilate into the sm fermions as shown in fig .",
    "then @xmath26 it is shown in @xcite that the excess gamma rays from the gc can be explained by the dm annihilation primarily into tau lepton pairs , with the annihilation cross section @xmath27 in the range of @xmath28s to @xmath29s .",
    "taking @xmath30 gev , this requires @xmath31 it was also pointed out in @xcite that the dm x may annihilate into @xmath32 or @xmath33 final states up to @xmath34% of the time without spoiling the dm interpretation of the excess gamma rays from the gc .",
    "this means @xmath35     the feynman diagrams for ( a ) , ( b ) : the scalar dm annihilation process @xmath36 and ( c),(d ) : the scalar dm - bottom quark scattering . for the case of vector dm ,",
    "the diagrams are the same except for the external scalar bosons to be replaced by the vector bosons ]    the interaction terms in eqs.([eq : yukawa],[eq : yukawa - vector ] ) can also induce spin - independent x - nucleon scattering as shown in fig .",
    "1c , d . to escape flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) constraints",
    ", we will assume following @xcite that only @xmath37 and @xmath38 are significant for x - y - quark couplings .",
    "the corresponding direct detection cross section @xcite is the same for both scalar x and vector @xmath39 , as @xmath40 where @xmath41 @xcite with the uncertainties coming mainly from @xmath42 .",
    "the cogent and dama / libra results , if interpreted as dm elastic scattering , require @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "this implies the following constraint @xmath44 which completely contradicts eq.([eq : gcconstraint ] ) .",
    "therefore it seems to be difficult , if not impossible , for the scalar or vector wimpless dm to account for the gamma ray excess from the gc together with the direct detection results of cogent and dama .",
    "furthermore , even if we forget about the direct detection signals , there are stringent constraints , if considering the wmap haze , from anomalous magnetic moment of leptons and some lepton flavor violating decays . as analyzed in @xcite , the wmap haze could be accounted for by the dm annihilation democratically into @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , which means @xmath45 but as shown in fig 2(a ) , the @xmath46 couplings also contribute to the anomalous magnetic moment of leptons .",
    "for the scalar case , it is found to be should be @xmath47 . ]",
    "@xmath48 while for the vector case , it is @xmath49    there is well known @xmath50 deviation for the muon anomalous magnetic moment between the sm expectation and experimental measurement as @xcite @xmath51 for the scalar case , this limits @xmath52 which strongly violates eq.([eq : hazeconstraint ] ) .",
    "for the vector case , assuming @xmath53 , the second term of eq.([vector - amu ] ) is about one order smaller than the first term , and we obtain @xmath54 which again severely violates eq.([eq : hazeconstraint ] ) .    for the electron ,",
    "the experimental data gives @xmath55 @xcite which agrees well with the sm calculation @xmath56@xcite .",
    "we will assume @xmath57 which is slightly larger than the theoretical error , to get a restriction on the corresponding @xmath58 couplings @xmath59 which also strongly violates eq.([eq : hazeconstraint ] ) .",
    "if one connector field @xmath60 can couple to different generations of leptons , namely @xmath61 , the @xmath46 interactions could also induce the lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 decays , as shown in fig .",
    "as the anomalous magnetic moment of leptons already exclude the possibility for scalar or vector wimpless dm to explain the wmap haze together with the excess gamma rays from the gc , we will not investigate further these lfv decays .",
    "but in the next section these lfv decays will turn out to be important in the case of fermion wimpless dm .",
    "the @xmath46 interactions contribute to ( a ) the anomalous magnetic moment of leptons and ( b ) the lepton flavor violating @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 decays with scalar x. for the case of vector @xmath39 , the diagrams are the same except for the internal scalar line to be replaced by the vector line . ]    therefore in scalar or vector wimpless models , neither the wmap haze nor the cogent and dama observations could be explained simultaneously with the excess gamma rays from the gc .",
    "if the dm particle @xmath24 is a fermion , the connector fields @xmath65 should be either scalar or vector fields .",
    "for the scalar @xmath65 case , the interactions can be written as @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are different scalar fields carrying different sm charges .",
    "for the vector @xmath65 case , the corresponding interactions are @xmath69 here @xmath67 and @xmath68 are different vector fields .    with the above lagrangians",
    ", the dm particles can annihilate into the sm fermions as shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) with the cross section @xmath70 assuming for simplicity @xmath71 and taking @xmath30 gev , the excess gamma rays from the gc restricts @xmath72 which corresponds to the dm annihilation into @xmath8 with the cross section @xmath73s .",
    "equivalently this means @xmath74 gev for scalar y and @xmath75 gev for vector @xmath76 . as @xmath77 behaves just like slepton ,",
    "this does not contradict , if @xmath78 is not much smaller than one , with the direct searches at lep which constrain the sleptons to be heavier than @xmath22 gev @xcite .    considering direct detection experiments , the dm - nucleon scattering , as shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) , should be evaluated . in the large @xmath23 limit and after a fierz transformation , the dm - quark scattering can be written as effective operators @xmath79 notice that the spin - independent and velocity - independent contribution to dm - nucleon scattering comes only from the vector - vector interaction .",
    "assuming @xmath80 , the dm - nucleon scattering cross section is @xmath81 to obtain @xmath43 suggested by the cogent and dama results , one finds @xmath82 equivalently this means @xmath83 gev for scalar y and @xmath84 gev for vector @xmath76 .",
    "as @xmath85 behaves just like exotic fourth generation quark , the scalar y case seems to be in disagreement , if @xmath86 is smaller than one , with the tevatron direct searches which limit the exotic fourth generation quark to be heavier than @xmath87 gev @xcite . while for the vector @xmath76 case",
    ", it is only marginally consistent with the tevatron limit .     the feynman diagrams for ( a ) the dm annihilation process @xmath36 , ( b ) the dm - quark scattering , ( c ) the anomalous magnetic moment of leptons and ( d ) the lepton flavor violating @xmath88 decay with the scalar connector fields .",
    "for the vector @xmath76 case , the diagrams are the same except for all internal scalar lines to be replaced by the vector lines . ]    to explain the wmap haze in the same framework , the dm candidate x should annihilate democratically into @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , which means @xmath89 the anomalous magnetic moment of leptons , as shown in fig .",
    "3(c ) , can be evaluated as @xmath90 for the case of scalar connector fields .",
    "similarly the contribution of vector connector fields to lepton s anomalous magnetic moment is @xmath91 notice that in both cases , the above contributions to lepton s anomalous magnetic moment are negative , which is opposite in sign to the @xmath50 deviation of the muon s anomalous magnetic moment @xmath92 .",
    "therefore it is impossible for the fermion wimpless models to account for the @xmath50 deviation of @xmath93 .",
    "instead the wimpless contribution should be small enough , say @xmath94 , so that the situation does not become significantly worse .",
    "then one can obtain the following limits for the scalar y case @xmath95 which are consistent with eq.([eq : fermion - haze ] ) .",
    "however for the vector connector fields , the limits are @xmath96 where unfortunately the muon s @xmath97 leads to a constraint too stringent to be satisfied by eq.([eq : fermion - haze ] ) .",
    "furthermore , if one connector field @xmath60 can couple to any charged leptons , namely @xmath98 , it could also induce the lepton flavor violating @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 decays , as shown in fig .",
    "notice that the photon can also be attached to external lepton lines , but those diagrams are gauge - dependent and should be canceled by the gauge - dependent part of fig .",
    "3(d ) . then taking the final state lepton to be massless and assuming for simplicity @xmath99",
    ", the decay width is found to be @xmath100 experimentally @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 @xcite lead to the constraints @xmath104 for the case of scalar ( vector ) connector fields .",
    "unfortunately all the above limits are in clear contradiction with the requirement of the wmap haze of eq.([eq : fermion - haze ] ) .",
    "in this paper we discuss in wimpless models the possibility to interpret the excess gamma rays from the galactic center , the wmap haze and the cogent and dama results . at the same time some low energy constraints must be satisfied , such as the anomalous magnetic moment of leptons and lepton flavor violating @xmath105 decays .",
    "notice that a connector sector y is introduced to couple the dm candidate x to the sm particles via yukawa - like interactions .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the excess gamma rays from the gc implies that the dm particles should annihilate dominantly into lepton pairs with @xmath32 or @xmath33 final states less than @xmath34% of the time . for scalar or vector wimpless dm",
    ", this limits the coupling strength of @xmath106 to be too small to account for the cogent and dama observations . to interpret the wmap haze , the @xmath107 coupling is required to be roughly universal for @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 leptons , which will lead to too large contribution to anomalous magnetic moment of electron and muon .    as to fermion wimpless dm with scalar or vector connector sector , @xmath111",
    "a few @xmath112 could accommodate the excess gamma rays from the gc and the cogent and dama results .",
    "this corresponds to a scalar connector particle @xmath85 less than @xmath113 gev or a vector @xmath85 less than about @xmath114 gev . as @xmath85 couples to quarks",
    ", it behaves like an exotic fourth generation quark , which has been restricted by the tevatron to be heavier than @xmath87 gev @xcite .",
    "therefore the scalar y case seems to be disfavored , while the vector @xmath76 case is only marginally consistent with the tevatron limit . instead , to interpret the wmap haze in the same framework ,",
    "the constraints of anomalous magnetic moment of leptons can only be satisfied for the scalar connector fields .",
    "furthermore , if there is only one connector field for charged leptons , the lepton flavor violating @xmath88 decays could happen in both cases with too large branching ratios severely violating the experimental bounds .",
    "therefore it is difficult , if not impossible , for the scalar or vector wimpless dm to interpret the excess gamma rays from the gc together with either the wmap haze or the direct detection experiments cogent and dama .",
    "while for fermion wimpless dm , it may be possible to accommodate the excess gamma rays from the gc and the cogent and dama results with vector connector fields , though it is just marginally consistent with the tevatron limit . on the contrary , only scalar connector fields could explain the wmap haze under the constraints of anomalous magnetic moment of the leptons .",
    "in addition , if one connector field can couple to any charged leptons , the lepton flavor violating @xmath88 decays could happen with the branching ratios surpassing the current experimental bounds by ( at most ) even several orders of magnitude .",
    "quantitatively , the above conclusions are only valid in the wimpless models . but going beyond this specific model , one may at least learn that the excess gamma rays from the galactic center , if interpreted as dm annihilation , could impose strong constraint on the dm couplings to quarks .",
    "then one should check , under this constraint , the interpretation of the cogent and dama results in terms of elastic dm - nucleon scattering .",
    "it is also interesting to investigate the interplay between the direct and indirect dm searches and low energy precision observables , such as anomalous magnetic moment of leptons and the lepton flavor violating decays .",
