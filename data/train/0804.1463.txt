    "transport phenomena play a fundamental role in many physical systems . in this context , dissipative ratchet dynamics has attracted considerable interest over the past years . particles placed into periodic but sawtooth like potentials and driven by external forces or nonequilibrium noise create a directed flow even if the forces and noise vanishes in average .",
    "thus unbiased forces induce a directed motion , a concept which was successfully applied to many different biological or mesoscopic systems .",
    "we refer here to the various overviews on molecular and brownian motors @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this physical concept was subsequently generalized to potential landscapes possessing reflection symmetry which in addition are subjected to asymmetrical driving @xcite-@xcite and , as well , to hamiltonian transport in absence of dissipation and enduring agitating fluctuations @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the starting point for our investigation is a system obeying reflection symmetry , both in space and time .",
    "being interested in the particle transport features in a nonintegrable situation we study the following equation of motion @xmath0 we consider spatially periodic forces @xmath1 such as e.g. the one provided by a completely symmetric potential @xmath2 . the time - varying ac - force in ( [ eq : triv1 ] ) , @xmath3 , periodically modulates the inclination of the space - periodic potential @xmath4 .",
    "this set - up destroys the integrability of the system dynamics .",
    "in particular , around the corresponding separatrix in phase space a chaotic layer develops . like in multistable potentials",
    "the motion becomes irregular and trajectories jump erratically from one potential well to another , being not always the adjacent one . hence particles are scattered by the nonlinear forces and , obviously , the property of a directed current will typically be lost .",
    "remarkably , as pointed out in prior literature @xcite,@xcite , in the system ( [ eq : triv1 ] ) there results an ( unexpected ) asymmetry of the flux of particles , emanating from one potential well , and flowing to the left and right potential wells which indicates the existence of directed transport without breaking the reflection symmetry in space and time in this system .",
    "one reason for the occurrence of phase - dependent directed transport is the lowering of the symmetry of the flow in phase space by the ac - field where this asymmetry vanishes only for specific values of the initial phase @xmath5 @xcite .    also of interest in this",
    "context is ref .",
    "therein the authors report further on this exceptional situation and show that directed transport is sustained on fairly long time scales despite the presence of chaos . in particular it has been demonstrated that for sufficiently small forcing frequencies , @xmath6 , the width of the arising chaotic layer diverges leading to a strong enhancement of the chaotic transport @xcite .    here",
    "we complement and extend those prior studies @xcite , @xcite to the problem of escape and successively maintaining _ exclusive directed motion_. more precisely , particles from a large ensemble that are initially contained in a well of the potential have to surmount the corresponding barrier .",
    "we show that adiabatically slow modulations of the potential lead to that all of the escaping particles not only leave the potential well in the same direction but subsequently enter the regime of long - lasting transients for which the transport proceeds _ unidirectional _ in a ballistic fashion .",
    "the direction of this arising flow over giant distances depends on the initial phase @xmath5 about which we do not average .    that trajectories contained initially in the interior of the separatrix",
    "can escape to neighboring wells of the potential is related with sweeping across the chaotic layer and crossing the separatrix .",
    "precisely for this situation the authors in @xcite deomstrated ( applying ac - forces with frequencies @xmath7 ) that the mean time - averaged velocity of a particle ensemble decays inversely proportional with time and thus tending to zero asymptotically .",
    "in contrast , we demonstrate here that for driving with a sufficiently slow ac - field the mean time - averaged velocity attains a finite value , virtually not altering on long time scales . as we shall show this is due to the fact that there occurs only a single event of separatrix crossing , namely the one guiding a particle from the inner to the outer region .",
    "despite that afterwards the particles closely re - approach the separatrix periodically in time further crossings are avoided .",
    "we further provide reasonings for the occurrence of the flow on the basis of the underlying phase space structure .",
    "the only assumption we have to make is that particles which are initially trapped in the interior of the separatrix are included in the arising chaotic layer around the separatrix in phase space",
    ". we will find and discuss the situation that large ensembles of particles do not only escape from the separatrix but also move in the same direction .",
    "this in turn yields a giant current .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we introduce the model of the particle motion in a symmetric , periodic potential , associated with the force .",
    "the inclination of this potential is being time - periodically modulated .",
    "the structure of the phase space is elucidated . in section [ sec : layers ] we investigate the influence of the modulation frequency on the formation of stochastic layers in phase space .",
    "in particular , we determine the range in which the momentum variable can vary .",
    "the analysis in section [ sec : growth ] concerns the chaos - induced escape of individual trajectories from the interior of the separatrix .",
    "in the subsequent section [ sec : ratchet ] an explanation for the effect of an enormous enhancement occurring in the adiabatically driven system is given in terms of the underlying phase space dynamics .",
    "the dynamics of ensembles of particles contained initially in the interior of the separatrix and their contributions to a directed flow are addressed in section [ sec : current ] .",
    "we close with a summary of our obtained results .",

    "for fairly fast varying modulations with @xmath47 a chaotic layer of small width develops around the separatrix , whereas the motion remains trapped and regular within the large island of stability with its center at the origin of the phase plane .",
    "the deformed horizontal lines above and below the large island of stability correspond to kam tori which act as barriers for transport impeding larger upwards and downwards excursions of the momentum variable .",

    "most strikingly , independent of the sign of the inclination of the potential the density of the points in the stroboscopic plots is much higher in the region of positive momentum than in the region of negative ones .",
    "thus , the momentum variable is allowed to raise to fairly large positive values . due to symmetry for an initial phase value @xmath49 of the external field ,",
    "i.e. when during the first half - period @xmath50 the inclination becomes positive , an equivalent behavior is observed except that the cloud of points now penetrates more into the range of negative @xmath9 .    in the following we focus our interest on the generation of a directed flow for a large ensemble of particles where _ all of them _ perform _ exclusively ballistic _ motion in the same direction .",
    "note that this represents a far stronger condition than merely observing directed , diffusive transport of particles as illustrated in @xcite .",
    "our set up is the following : if the potential assumes , let us say , a negative inclination due to a static force @xmath51 we suppose that the dynamics of the particles is bounded in one well and the corresponding potential barrier is insurmountable , i.e. for all particles it holds that @xmath52 .",
    "accordingly , the initial conditions for our simulations are distributed in the interior of the corresponding separatrix loop ( see also below in fig .",

    "the particles remain trapped in the potential well .",
    "however , this scenario drastically changes when the time - dependent perturbations destroy the integrability . in particular homoclinic chaos",
    "is present in the driven dynamics .",
    "in fact , those trajectories seized by the arising chaotic layer may manage to escape from the interior region of the broken separatrix .",
    "we emphasize that this trapping - detrapping transition can only be triggered by the chaotic dynamics within the chaotic layer .",
    "when applying the time - periodic modulation of the inclination with initial phase set at @xmath34 our starting point is a non - inclined potential .",
    "motion is then supposed to proceed towards the right . since in the initial stage @xmath50 ,",
    "the inclination passes from zero value to its maximal negative value it contributes to a continually growing positive force which promotes the desired motion towards the right .",
    "the question then is : what determines an efficient escape of trapped particles starting out from distributed initial conditions ? is the direction of the motion of the escaped particles determined completely by the choice of the phase of the modulation term ?",
    "if so , for which parameter values do the escaped particles keep moving ( on average ) in the preferred right direction on longer time scales ?",

    "the main objective is to demonstrate that for imposed slow modulations a preferred direction of motion emerges although on average the potential landscape remains unbiased .",

    "the escape set comprising those initial conditions that lead to escape out from the solid separatrix loop is given by the hatched area ( in green online ) . ]",
    "first , we identified the escape set , comprising of all those initial conditions that are contained in the interior of the static separatrix loop that lead to chaos - induced escape . to this end",
    ", the separatrix loop has been populated densely with points corresponding to initial conditions for the dynamics of the periodically driven system .",

    "the remaining parameter values are @xmath33 and @xmath34 . ]",
    "we recall that escape , i.e. the detrapping , requires a separatrix crossing .",
    "apparently , the moment of the first separatrix crossing , i.e. the trapping - detrapping transition , governs the efficiency of the enhancement process , as discussed in section [ sec : growth ] . of great importance for the speed - up of an escaped particle",
    "is that the first separatrix crossing occurs at instants of time @xmath126 , which determines the boundary for enhancement .",
    "more specifically , according to eq.([equation : pmax ] ) , the length of the enhancement period determines the growth in momentum and thus the value of the resulting current .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : esctimer ] we deduce the corresponding time scale for escape beyond the separatrix .",
    "while for the largest angular driving frequency @xmath127 the escape takes place at times far beyond the boundary , marked as @xmath122 in fig .",
    "[ fig : esctimer ] , we note that for an intermediate angular frequency at @xmath40 almost all escape events occur before the corresponding enhancement boundary @xmath128 , marked as @xmath123 . for slow driving at @xmath80 ,",
    "however , the scales of @xmath108 stretch over a wide range , but practically all escape events do occur at @xmath129 , marked as @xmath124 .",
    "moreover , due to the irregular nature of the underlying dynamics , for an ensemble of escaping particles with distributed initial conditions the moments of their corresponding first separatrix crossing depend sensitively on the initial conditions .",
    "trajectories starting out very close to the hyperbolic point are the first to escape , whereas for those initial conditions which are located away from the separatrix considerable time passes until escape takes place . from fig .",
    "[ fig : tesc ] , depicting the mean escape time versus the angular driving frequency @xmath54 , we infer that for low angular frequencies @xmath130 the escape times are sufficiently smaller than @xmath128 . in contrast , for @xmath131 at least the upper error bars of the escape times are of the order of , or higher , than @xmath128 .",
    "this hampers a pronounced enhancement and in turn tends to suppress the directed flow .     and @xmath125 , respectively . the number of particles emanating from the escape set shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : escapeset ] is taken as @xmath132 .",
    "the remaining parameter values are @xmath33 and @xmath34 . ]    connecting the lower error bars of the mean escape time by a line we find that the latter is very well fitted by the expression @xmath133 . since this line is parallel to the one of the mean escape time the latter obeys the @xmath134-dependence as well .      with regard to directed flow",
    "we note that for @xmath135 we find that for the entire escape set the associated trajectories move in the _ same _ direction over an extended period of time .",
    "thus , the generation of a huge , uni - directional current becomes possible .",
    "we define the directed current as the time average of the ensemble averaged momentum , i.e. , @xmath136 with the ensemble average given by @xmath137 here , @xmath138 denotes the number of particles constituting the ensemble . in fig .",
    "[ fig : current ] we depict the time evolution of the directed current @xmath139 for moderate , intermediate and very slow modulations .    ) for three different angular driving frequencies of the inclination - modulation force as labeled correspondingly on the graphs .",
    "the amplitude and the initial phase of the external force are set at @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "the number of particles is @xmath132 . ]",
    "the time is scaled according to @xmath140 ; thus assuring that for a given simulation time @xmath141 the number of oscillation periods of the external force is the same regardless of the value of the used angular frequency @xmath54 . at a moderate driving frequency of @xmath47 the average flow ( numerically ) practically vanishes asymptotically on the displayed time scale , whereas for @xmath40 the decay towards zero proceeds slower .",
    "this is in compliance with the findings in @xcite .",
    "in distinct contrast , however , for extreme slow driving at @xmath41 , the mean momentum assumes a quasi - stationary regime of considerable large size .",
    "we note that our observed averaged directed current persists over a long time interval that agrees well with the explicit estimate for the duration , @xmath142 of unidirectional motion given in @xcite , which adopted to our system notation reads @xmath143}\\,,\\ ] ] yielding for @xmath144 and @xmath33 a figure of the order of @xmath145 .",
    "plotting the directed current as as a function of the angular driving frequency @xmath54 one notices a strong decay of the current with increasing angular driving frequency ( not shown here ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath134 dependence of the current corroborates with the expression for the momentum gain given in eq.([equation : pmax ] ) ; see also in ref .",
    "@xcite,@xcite , providing intuitive arguments that support the strong enhancement of the chaotic transport in space .",
    "in this work we have investigated the dissipation - less , time - dependent driven hamiltonian dynamics of particles evolving in a symmetric , spatially periodic potential whose inclination is temporally varied periodically by an external ac - force .",
    "we have focused interest on the generation of a directed flow of ensembles particles which are trapped in the interior of a potential well .",
    "the choice of the initial starting values is subjected to the condition that for a static inclination the trapped particles can not escape from a potential well .",
    "then , the only possibility left for escape from the potential well is due to the chaotic dynamics which arises in the system dynamics due to the time - dependent forcing term .",
    "in fact , upon applying the time - periodic modulation of the inclination , trajectories that become embraced by the developing chaotic layer around the broken separatrix may cross the latter .",
    "however , for fast and intermediate modulation frequency there results no substantial directed flow .",
    "this is so , because the trajectories frequently cross and re - cross the separatrix corresponding to leaving and re - entering the adjacent wells of the potential wherein the particles dwell .",
    "for adiabatic inclination modulations we have demonstrated that for all initial conditions contained in the escape set , motion takes place in a unique direction that is controlled by the phase of the modulation term .",
    "it has been shown that the slower the modulation the larger is the gain in momentum of the escaped particles and thus the emerging asymptotic current that obeys a @xmath134 dependence .    concerning an explanation of this phenomenon",
    "it seems that the cantori , partitioning the nonuniform chaotic layer , are the less leaky the smaller the modulation frequency @xmath54 .",
    "research regarding the modulation frequency dependence of the sticking times to the boundary of regular islands is in progress @xcite .",
    "the cantori form almost impenetrable barriers that confine trajectories for a very long but _ transient _ period .",
    "one should remark that eventually this transient period of directed motion terminates because the trajectory escapes through one of the holes in the cantori and accesses other regions of the chaotic layer .",
    "therefore the motion does not necessarily proceed unidirectionally : unless the trajectory gets captured by ballistic channels it itinerates within the chaotic layer going along with changes of the direction of motion .",
    "suitable physical systems that come to mind to experimentally test our findings are periodically driven cold atom optical lattices , as recently fabricated in studying dissipative , classical ratchet dynamics @xcite . in order to verify our multi - facetted findings of",
    "directed , dissipation - less transport the use of off - resonant , far detuned laser beams is required ; thus minimizing the dissipation in these cold atom set - ups : a scenario proposed in different context also for hamiltonian quantum ratchets in refs .",
    "moreover , the particle trapping - detrapping transitions induced by time - dependent modulations of the potential as described in this manuscript can also be applied in fluid dynamics to design particle traps in incompressible open flows as discussed in @xcite . as an interesting extension of the present work we currently engage in studying this dissipation - less enhancement effect for coupled nonlinear systems which are composed of a chain of interacting particles @xcite .",
