    "in fact , in the regime of charge commensuration and strong interactions , electron states are almost localized , and the charge degree of freedom is frozen in the low energy limit .",
    "but , due to correlations , electron spin and angular momentum excitations can still propagate into the system , and therefore non trivial collective behaviors can emerge",
    ".    however , unlike spin , orbital angular momentum in correlated materials turns out to be very subtle .",
    "while examples of magnetic order are known since millennia ( magnetite ) , correlated orbital states have attracted attention only recently  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a direct probe of orbital degrees of freedom seems to be challenging . due to its quenching in almost all relevant @xmath0 transition metal oxides  @xcite , orbital angular momentum does not contribute to magnetic moment .",

    "for the same reason , orbital angular momentum is hardly detectable even on a microscopic scale .",
    "neutron scattering , for instance , is almost blind to orbital degrees of freedom , since neutrons can interact only via magnetic coupling  @xcite .",
    "having in mind these general considerations , the relevance of the resonant inelastic x - ray spectroscopy ( rixs )  @xcite in studying orbital degrees of freedom in transition metal oxides can be better understood . in fact , due to the electromagnetic coupling , photons interact strongly with local orbital angular momenta and , moreover , the inelastic nature of this technique allows one to measure directly orbital excited states , e.g. , @xmath1 excitations  @xcite .",
    "direct observations of orbital excitations however are often controversial because typically such @xmath1 excitations couple strongly to the lattice , so that their energy dispersion can not be unequivocally identified .",
    "however , rixs spectroscopy allows one also to probe _ indirectly _ orbital degrees of freedom , by looking at magnetic excitations . at a transition metal ion @xmath2 or @xmath3 edge ,",
    "the core hole in the intermediate state lies deep in the @xmath4 shell , where the spin orbit coupling is strong enough to allow spin flip transitions in the final state .",
    "since orbital angular momentum and spin are strongly coupled , spin flip transitions cross sections depend strongly on the local orbital state . in this way , by measuring the magnetic excitations one can shed light on the orbital nature of the ground state of a strongly correlated system . more precisely , the polarization dependence of rixs intensities of spin flip transitions allows one to determine the symmetries of the occupied orbital states .",

    "in general , the intermediate state hamiltonian can be very complicated , even considering only local interactions , since electrons in the valence states are interacting with themselves and with the potential created by the core hole via coulomb repulsion , and the independent electron approximation is no longer realistic .     for pure spin flip transitions for a single cu@xmath26 ion at @xmath3 edge , with spin in the @xmath27 plane , and for several orbital ground state symmetries .",

    "if one neglects long range interactions between the core hole and the surrounding ions , the only relevant interaction in the intermediate state is the spin orbit one .",
    "the energy levels of the core hole intermediate state are therefore split into two subsets , with total angular momentum @xmath32 and @xmath33 , that corresponds to the resonant edges @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "following  @xcite , the core hole propagator can be written in terms of these core hole states . for large spin orbit coupling , only core hole states which are resonantly excited contribute to the propagator , while the others become negligible , so that @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the core hole state with energy @xmath36 .",
