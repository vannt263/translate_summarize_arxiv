    "model systems play a prominent role in kohn - sham ( ks ) @xcite density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite , due to their utility in understanding and guiding the development of physically sound and accurate exchange - correlation ( xc ) functionals , which shall include quantum effects of the many - electron interaction .",
    "thus , over the years , a wide number of model systems has been considered within dft @xcite .",
    "the first , and probably most important , model system of dft has been the uniform electron gas @xcite that is a paradigm for solid - state physics and most non - empirical xc functionals @xcite .",
    "the uniform electron gas model leads straightforwardly to relatively simple explicit expressions for both the exchange and the correlation energy of a many electron system , within the so called local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite .",
    "this approximation , despite its simplicity , provides a remarkably good qualitative description of inhomogeneous electronic systems , however , it fails severely to yield accurate quantitative results .    for this reason",
    "many improvements over the lda level of theory have been proposed @xcite . in particular , by using the gradient of the density as an additional input ingredient , useful generalized gradient approximation @xcite ( gga ) functionals have been developed , which provide a good compromise between simplicity , computational efficiency , and numerical accuracy @xcite .",
    "alternatively , for the correlation energy , rey and savin @xcite proposed to consider a model system ( jellium with gap ) obtained by adding a non - local one - body operator to the true hamiltonian of the uniform electron gas , in order to force an arbitrary gap @xmath0 between occupied and virtual orbitals . in this way , in fact , the strong overestimation of the lda correlation can be largely corrected .",
    "moreover , for the jellium with gap model system the correlation energy can be computed with high accuracy for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "then , an analytic representation of the lda with gap correlation functional is readily available @xcite .    this formula can be easily extended to be used for inhomogeneous systems after providing , in analogy with the usual lda approach , an appropriate local description of the gap ( i.e. a function @xmath1({\\mathbf{r}})$ ] ) .",
    "this idea was used as a seed to construct the kcis @xcite and kcisk @xcite correlation functionals which showed , with their good performance , the advantages of the jellium with gap model system . however , in the construction of the kcis / kcisk functional only a limited focus was posed on the local gap functional and a rather simple ansatz was used for the gap @xmath0 . in contrast , several important constraints of the exact correlation energy , were satisfied using the conventional approach of gga and meta - gga functionals .",
    "in particular , the lda for the uniform electron gas at @xmath2 was substituted by a gga expression to assure the recovery of the second - order gradient expansion for the correlation energy ( only at @xmath2 ) @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we want to resume the work on the jellium with gap correlation and explore the possibility to construct appropriate local gap models in order to achieve an accurate description of inhomogeneous electronic systems . in this sense ,",
    "our work differs from the one performed for the kcis / kcisk functionals @xcite , because of the stronger attention we put on the construction of the local gap function .",
    "we show in fact that it is possible , in general , to recover many exact properties of the correlation energy by building a suitable local gap function @xmath0 , being a functional of the density and its gradient .",
    "the focus of our work will be on the gga level of theory because , being this the most simple beyond lda , it is also the most powerful for showing the significance of various exact conditions and for exploring and explaining the physics related to a particular model system .",
    "thus , by developing two , conceptually different , local gap models , we aim at showing the power of this approach . at the same time",
    ", our functionals may be also considered the basis for more sophisticated developments , even beyond the gga level .",
    "nevertheless , in this paper we address only the gga level and thus all our results are compared with the gga state - of - the - art ones .",
    "within the jellium with gap model @xcite the correlation energy is defined as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the electron density , @xmath5 is the local seitz radius , @xmath6 is the relative spin polarization , @xmath0 is the gap , and @xmath7\\ .\\ ] ] in eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) the spin mixing factor is @xmath8 while the fully - spin - polarized ( @xmath9 ) and the spin - unpolarized ( @xmath10 ) correlation energies per particle have the form ( the spin index is omitted hereafter for notational simplicity ) @xmath11 with @xmath12 being the conventional local density approximation for the correlation energy and @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 some density - dependent coefficients @xcite .",
    "full details about the construction of the model as well as its asymptotic properties are discussed in the appendix .",
    "the main goal of this work is finding appropriate local gap functions @xmath16 ( with @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) , such that exact contraints of the correlation energy can be imposed to the jellium with gap model .",
    "the idea behind this approach is that the lda model with a gap can accurately describe , at each point in space , the correlation energy per particle of an inhomogeneous electron distribution if a proper gap is applied at each point , depending on the local / semilocal properties of the electron densities at that point .    to this end",
    ", we consider in the appendix a detailed analysis of several known exact constraints for the correlation energy and their relation with local gap function . in particular we consider the uniform electron gas limit ( @xmath19 ) , the slowly - varying density limit ( @xmath20 ) , the rapidly - varying density limit ( @xmath21 ) , the uniform scaling to the high - density limit @xcite , and the thomas - fermi scaling @xcite",
    ". using this information we can propose two local gap functions able to enforce a set of exact constraints on the jellium with gap correlation .    with the aim of imposing the second - order gradient expansion behavior we consider the general formula of eq .",
    "( [ e25 ] ) and set @xmath22 with @xmath23t^2}{a + t^2}\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the @xmath25-dependent second - order correlation coefficient of hu and langreth @xcite ( we use the parametrization of ref . ) and @xmath26 is a parameter fixed by minimizing the variance of the correlation energy error for the noble gas atoms he , ne , and ar .",
    "the resulting functional is labeled gapc and satisfies all the exact constraints mentioned before ( i.e. the uniform electron gas and the slowly - varying limits , the rapidly - varying density limit , the uniform scaling towards the high - density limit , and the thomas - fermi scaling behavior ; see the appendix for details ) .",
    "thus , it formally fulfills the same exact conditions as the pbe correlation functional @xcite .",
    "however , the gapc functional recovers the true second - order gradient expansion at any @xmath25 , whereas pbe does it only in the high - density limit .",
    "moreover , in the tail of an atomic density @xmath27 , with @xmath28 , ( note that @xmath29 ) , therefore the gapc functional has the tail decay @xmath30 , closer to the behavior described in ref .",
    "( note that @xmath31 ) .",
    "a second useful local gap function can be obtained by dropping the requirement that the second - order gradient expansion behavior is satisfied .",
    "this condition was shown in fact to be not very important for many cases @xcite . in this way",
    "the choice of the local gap function is no more bound to eq .",
    "( [ e25 ] ) and a more flexible ansatz can be employed .",
    "our choice , which defines the gaploc functional is @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 note that @xmath36 ( @xmath37 being the von weizsker kinetic energy density @xcite ) is the local gap function used in the kcis / kcisk functionals @xcite .",
    "the two parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 were fixed by fitting to the exact correlation energy per particle of the he atom ( i.e. the function @xmath40 reported in ref . ) .",
    "we recall that fitting to the energy density of model systems is a common practice in dft , used for instance in the construction of the am05 @xcite and arpa+ @xcite gga functionals , which may help to reduce the error cancellation effects in contrast to fitting to integrated energies .",
    "the gaploc functional satisfies the following exact constraints :    \\(1 ) lda limit ; in fact for @xmath41 we have @xmath42 .",
    "note however that for @xmath43 the functional behaves as @xmath44 thus , as anticipated , the gaploc functional does not recover the second - order gradient expansion behavior but approaches the lda limit much faster .",
    "\\(2 ) rapidly - varying density limit ; for @xmath45 and @xmath25 finite , @xmath46 and the correlation correctly vanishes .",
    "\\(3 ) uniform scaling to the high density - limit ; in this limit @xmath47 .",
    "thus , according to eq .",
    "( [ e26 ] ) @xmath48 and the logarithmic divergence of lda is canceled .",
    "\\(4 ) thomas - fermi scaling ; in fact in this limit we have @xmath49 and @xmath50 for any positive @xmath51 .",
    "the tail behavior of the gaploc functional can be also easily inspected noting that in the tail of an atomic density @xmath52 , with @xmath53 ( see appendix ) .",
    "thus , the local gap function behaves as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is weakly dependent on @xmath56 .",
    "equation ( [ e42 ] ) indicates that as @xmath57 then @xmath58 therefore the gaploc functional ( a.i .",
    "@xmath59 ) decays as @xmath60 .",
    "however , because the actual value of the @xmath61 parameter is rather large this asymptotic behavior is set only quite far in the tail , whereas at smaller distances the local gap function is quite bigger . as a consequence the gaploc correlation energy per particle will decrease rather fast in the outer valence region and then attains a @xmath60 decay behavior in the far tail .    the different features of the gapc and gaploc functionals that we discussed above are summarized in figure [ fig1 ] where we report a plot of the correlation energy densities for several values of @xmath51 and @xmath25 and compare them with the the pbe functional .",
    "similar plots are obtained for the kcis / kcisk correlation energy densities .",
    "correlation energy density of different functionals as a function of the reduced gradient @xmath51 for several values of @xmath25 ( spin - unpolarized case ; @xmath62 ) . ]",
    "the figure highlights in particular the similarity of the gapc and pbe functionals for small @xmath51 and small @xmath25 , because both functionals recover the same second - order gradient expansion in this high - density limit .",
    "the similarity is much less for larger values of the @xmath25 seitz parameter , because in this case the pbe functional fails to recover the correct value of @xmath24 .",
    "another important feature that emerges from the plot is the peculiar shape of the gaploc functional .",
    "in fact , as discussed above , this functional recovers the lda limit for a much broader interval of small @xmath51 values but then shows a sudden reduction of the correlation energy density at @xmath63 before starting a slow decay .",
    "this behavior corresponds , despite the slow asymptotic decay behavior , to a localization of the correlation energy density near the atomic nuclei .",
    "this is an important feature of this functional that will be discussed in more details later .",
    "@xmath64 versus the radial distance @xmath65 for the he atom .",
    "the exact curve is from ref . .",
    "]    finally , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig1b ] , the opposite of the radial correlation energy density ( @xmath64 ) versus the radial distance @xmath65 for the he atom . by construction",
    ", gaploc is very close to the exact curve .",
    "note instead that a functional that recovers the second - order gradient expansion in general can not be accurate near the nucleus , giving a too small ( in absolute value ) correlation energy density at small @xmath65 . then , assuming that this functional is accurate for the total correlation energy ( @xmath66 ) , it must give a too large ( in absolute value ) correlation energy density at larger @xmath65 .",
    "hence , such a correlation energy density is quite different from the exact behavior , being modified up to a gauge transformation @xcite .",
    "such a gauge had been the subject of intense research , at the hyper - gga level of theory @xcite .",
    "both pbe and gapc show this semilocal - gauge behavior , while pbeloc @xcite is definitely better due to the localization concept which incorporates @xcite .",
    "note also that gapc is slightly worse than pbe ( and very similar to revtpss instead ) , because it recovers the full ( correct ) second - order gradient expansion and its total correlation energy ( @xmath66 ) is slightly worse ( see table [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "to test the correlation functionals we performed several calculations on different test sets that are summarized below .",
    "we remark that the selection of tests for the assessment of the gapc functional in conjunction with the revpbe exchange @xcite was restricted to those properties and systems where the revpbe exchange may be expected to yield reasonable results @xcite ( e.g. atomization energies of organic molecules , atomic properties ) .",
    "we did not consider instead tests where the revpbe exchange is completely inadequate ( e.g. structural properties , metallic systems , solids ) , because in these cases it would be impossible to extract any useful information on the performance of the correlation , which is the target of the present study , due to the dominating exchange error .",
    "the following sets of properties were considered    * * atomic and ionic correlation energies*. the correlation energies of a set of 24 atoms and ions were used as benchmark @xcite .",
    "in addition , we considered the second - order mller - plesset estimates of ref . as well as the results of virial - constrained effective hamiltonian method of ref . .",
    "* * jellium surface correlation energies*. we compared the surface correlation energies of semi - infinite jellium surfaces with bulk parameter @xmath67 , 3 , 4 , and 6 .",
    "reference data were taken from diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) calculations @xcite . * * atomization energies*. we assessed the atomization energies of organic molecules from the ae6 @xcite and the w4 @xcite test sets ; in addition , for transition metal complexes we considered the tm10ae set @xcite . *",
    "* organic reactions*. reaction energies and barrier heights from the bh6 @xcite , k9 @xcite , and dc9 @xcite test sets have been calculated . * * other properties * we considered the g21p set of ionization potentials of atoms and molecules @xcite , the ea13 test of electron affinities of atoms and molecules @xcite , the pa13 set comprising proton affinities of organic molecules @xcite , and the ae17 test set of atomic non - relativistic exchange - correlation energies @xcite .",
    "in addition , we tested the hb6 set of hydrogen - bond complexes @xcite .",
    "molecular calculations were carried out self - consistently with the turbomole program package @xcite using the def2-tzvpp basis set @xcite .",
    "atomic calculations for table [ tab2 ] were performed using a cc - pv5z basis set @xcite .",
    "atomic calculations for fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] were carried out with the engel code @xcite , using accurate exact exchange orbitals and densities .",
    "jellium calculations were performed with numerical kohn - sham lda orbitals and densities .",
    "fortran90 routines implementing both functionals are freely available on the web @xcite .",
    "in this section we report the results of some numerical calculations that we performed to assess the performance of the correlation functionals and study their properties in different contexts .",
    "table [ tab2 ] reports the correlation energy per electron of several atoms and ions as computed with different correlation functionals .",
    "[ cols=\"<,>,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the data in the table confirm that the gaploc functional is the most accurate for the description of the coulomb hole , with a mae of 0.04 bohr and a mare of 5% .",
    "note that this is a remarkable performance , even outperforming meta - gga functionals @xcite .",
    "good results are found also with the pbeloc correlation functional which yields a mae of 0.06 bohr , similar to the bloc meta - gga correlation functional @xcite .",
    "note that the pbe functional displays also a good performance , greatly improving over the lda , but still shows a systematic overestimation of the coulomb hole radius .",
    "in this paper we have studied the jellium with gap model in the context of the ground - state density functional theory .",
    "first , we have proposed a reparametrization of the spin - dependence of the jellium with gap correlation energy ( in the spirit of the perdew - wang lda correlation parametrization , see table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "next , we derived exact constraints for the local gap function , starting from known exact properties of the correlation energy .",
    "this analysis allowed us to construct two semilocal correlation functionals , namely gapc and gaploc , that keep the original jellium with gap functional form and are characterized solely by the modelling of the local gap function @xmath68 $ ] .",
    "the gapc functional recovers the correct second - order gradient expansion at any density , satisfies various density - scaling properties , and has a slower decay in the tail of the density than the pbe functional ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "it is well compatible with the revpbe exchange functional , which is considered one of the most accurate semilocal exchange , improving the total mae of various properties and test sets with about 15% ( see table [ tab4 ] ) .",
    "it competes with state - of - the - art gga functionals for the correlation energies of atoms and ions ( see table [ tab2 ] ) , while outperforms them for the jellium surface correlation energies ( see table [ table3 ] ) , suggesting that it can be a useful tool for solid - state physics if combined with a proper semilocal exchange .",
    "the gaploc functional satisfies various density - scaling properties , and recovers the lda functional over a wide range of slowly - varying regimes .",
    "this later feature is a direct consequence of the fitting to the exact correlation energy density of he atom .",
    "it is very accurate for total correlation energies of atoms and ions ( see table [ tab2 ] ) , performs reasonably well for jellium surface correlation energies ( see table [ table3 ] ) , and is one of the most compatible gga correlation functionals with the exact exchange ( see table [ tab5 ] ) .",
    "moreover , by constructing its underlying correlation hole , we have shown that it gives the most realistic real - space analysis of the atomic correlation energy ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , and coulomb hole radii ( see table [ tab6 ] ) .",
    "these results suggest that gaploc can be also used in construction of more sophisticated functionals ( e.g. hybrids and hyper - ggas ) .    finally , we mention that this work provides indications that the second - order gradient expansion of the correlation energy introduces a gauge in the correlation energy density which is not compatible with the exact exchange , but it is with semilocal exchange .",
    "thus , it is responsable for an important part of the exchange - correlation error compensation .",
    "the main equation defining the lda with gap model is eq .",

    "<S> functional , named gaploc , is satisfying the same exact conditions , except that the second - order gradient expansion is sacrificed for a better behavior under the thomas - fermi scaling and a more realistic correlation energy density of the hellium atom . </S>",
    "<S> the gaploc functional displays a high accuracy for atomic correlation energies , still preserving a reasonable behavior for jellium surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it shows a higher compatibility with the hartree - fock exchange than other semilocal correlation functionals . </S>",
