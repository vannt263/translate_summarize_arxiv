    "different phases of matter are separated in space and time by dividing layers called domain walls .",
    "the dynamics of the domain walls is the determining mechanism governing phase transitions in an intermediate range between very slow , quasi - static and very rapid , dynamical processes . in this intermediate range",
    "the phase transition speed and the speed of external constraints are comparable to each other .",
    "the dynamics of phase transitions is an involved subject even in macroscopic systems .",
    "first of all , phase transitions can be different .",
    "they may include slow burning or deflagration , detonation , condensation , evaporation , and many other forms of transition .",
    "nevertheless , the basic conditions of all these transitions have some similarities .",
    "these arise from the basic conservation laws and from the requirement of local , or at least approximately local , equilibrium .    in a dynamical situation",
    "the approach using the equation of state with a first order phase transition is identical both in compression and in expansion .",
    "if the compression is supersonic , shock or detonation waves are formed where the final new phase is immediately created .",
    "the phase transition speed influences only the width of the shock front . on the other hand , for slow dynamics and rapid phase transition the shock front width",
    "is primarily determined by the transport coefficients , viscosity and heat conductivity , and not by the phase transition speed .    at high energies",
    "a relativistic treatment is frequently necessary .",
    "it is important to mention that a system is also relativistic if the matter is radiation dominated , meaning that the rest mass of the constituent particles is zero or negligible compared to the fourth root of the energy density .",
    "these types of systems must be treated as relativistic even if the collective velocities are small .",
    "this was one of the important new features recognized in ref .",
    "if conserved charges do not exist the application of the conventional theory of phase transition dynamics @xcite is not possible , and this leads to essential differences in the phase transition dynamics .",
    "most importantly the flow is tied to the energy flow ; thus energy or heat current and the fluid flow are identical and heat conduction ( with respect to the flow ) may not occur . therefore the coefficient of heat conductivity does not exist , and can not govern the phase transition speed .",
    "the spatial configuration of phase transition instabilities varies in large homogeneous systems .",
    "when the conditions for the occurrence of a new phase are established the most common form of the appearance of the new phase happens via the formation of small critical size bubbles or droplets .",
    "( sub - critical size bubbles or droplets will shrink and vanish but supra - critical size ones will grow . )",
    "this configuration is called homogeneous nucleation .    as the level of supercooling increases and the amount of the new phase increases other geometries become energetically more favorable , such as elongated cylindrical objects ( spagetti ) or layers ( lasagna ) .",
    "the phase transition dynamics is then referred to as spinodal decomposition , indicating that systems which supercool ( or superheat ) and reach the adiabatic or isothermal spinodals on the phase diagram start the formation of the new phase in these configurations immediately .    finally , when the two phases are about equally abundant and/or the transition is extremely rapid the two phases form a somewhat random occupation of the configuration space called percolation .",
    "most frequently explicit dynamical calculations are performed for the homogeneous nucleation geometry as this is usually the initial and the slowest of all .",
    "nevertheless , the domain walls and their dynamical properties play an important role in all of the above mentioned configurations .",
    "one important feature of the nucleation studies that is not always recognized is that within the dynamical domain wall or droplet wall we do not have thermal equilibrium . here , quantities like energy , entropy or particle density make sense , while other quantities that rely on thermal equilibrium , such as the equation of state , may not .",
    "if the fluid is perfect and consists of a single phase of matter in full phase equilibrium , the flow is adiabatic @xcite .",
    "nevertheless entropy production is still possible if the system is out of phase equilibrium @xcite , or out of thermal equilibrium .",
    "thus , in domain walls entropy may be produced even in perfect fluids as here we do not have an equation of state which would satisfy the requirements of equilibrium thermodynamics .    in this paper",
    "we would like to discuss connections between the two most frequently encountered approaches to phase transitions using effective field theoretical models and phenomenological thermal and fluid dynamical methods . in section 2 we first demonstrate with a simple effective field theoretical model how one can obtain a landau - model type of phenomenological description of critical dynamics . in section 3",
    "we elaborate on the assumptions and error of different approaches used recently in the literature .",
    "we present a summary and conclusion in section 4 .",
    "a common approach to dealing with a phase transition in relativistic quantum field theory is to assume a uniform condensate @xmath0 for some scalar field and then to compute quantum and thermal fluctuations about that condensate @xcite .",
    "this is especially so for systems exhibiting spontaneous symmetry breaking where the condensate field serves as an order parameter to distinquish the two phases .",
    "examples include the higgs field in electroweak theory and the sigma field or scalar quark condensate in strong interaction physics . the resulting free energy density @xmath1 is obtained from the partition function @xmath2 in the usual way . @xmath3",
    "here @xmath4 is the volume . since the high temperature symmetric phase usually corresponds to @xmath5 , it is customary to define the effective potential as the deviation of the free energy from its value in the symmetric phase .",
    "@xmath6 the point @xmath5 is either a global minimum or only a local minimum depending on whether @xmath7 is greater than or less than the critical temperature @xmath8 , respectively . therefore the results of computations are often found to be , or parametrized as , a fourth order polynomial in @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath9 occasionally one will find additional terms of order @xmath10 or higher powers of @xmath0 , but these are not common and will not change our analysis qualitatively .    to give a specific example we will use the parametrization of ref .",
    "@xcite . @xmath11",
    "the @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are temperature independent constants , to be specified shortly . in an equilibrium state",
    "the free energy density is the negative of the pressure , @xmath16 .",
    "normalizing to the high temperature symmetric phase , and denoting the equilibrium pressure of that phase by @xmath17 , we have @xmath18 it is not enough to specify the effective potential ; the equilibrium pressure as a function of temperature must be specified too .    if one knows the free energy as a function of @xmath7 then the energy density @xmath19 can be calculated from the basic thermodynamic identities .",
    "in particular , if we want to know the energy density for a specific value of the condensate field , including out of equilibrium configurations also , then we must hold it fixed during the temperature differentiation .",
    "@xmath20 the first line above is the general thermodynamic identity ; the second line applies to the specific parametrization under discussion .",
    "if one is at a local minimum of the effective potential , either @xmath21 or @xmath22 corresponding to the high and low temperature phases , respectively , then it does nt matter whether the order parameter is held fixed during the differentiation or not because @xmath23 at those points .",
    "these two points correspond to thermodynamical equilibrium .",
    "if the system undergoes a first order phase transition at a critical temperature @xmath8 then at that temperature @xmath1 will have two degenerate minima . for",
    "a finite range of temperature above @xmath8 there will persist a higher , local minimum at @xmath22 .",
    "for a finite range of temperature below @xmath8 there will persist a higher , local minimum at @xmath21 .",
    "the most important physical quantities are the latent heat @xmath24 , the correlation lengths @xmath25 , which are equal for the fourth order effective potential at @xmath8 , and the surface energy @xmath26 . at the critical temperature the planar interfacial profile has a nice analytical solution on account of the fact that the effective potential becomes symmetric . in the usual way",
    "one finds that the profile field @xmath27 is @xmath28 \\ , .\\ ] ] this interpolates through intermediate non - equilibrium states from @xmath29 for @xmath30 to @xmath31 for @xmath32 .",
    "the surface energy can then be expressed as @xmath33 the parameters in the effective potential can be expressed in terms of these physical parameters as follows .",
    "@xmath34 for purposes of illustration , and with the qcd phase transition in mind , we choose the following numerical values .",
    "@xmath35 for the pressure in the high temperature phase we take 37 effective massless bosonic degrees of freedom corresponding to gluons and two flavors of quark , plus a bag constant @xmath36 to simulate confinement .",
    "@xmath37 the numerical value for the latent heat @xmath38 corresponds to a transition from the 37 degrees of freedom mentioned above to 3 degrees of freedom for massless pions .",
    "it is convenient to make everything dimensionless by measuring energies in units of @xmath8 and lengths in units of @xmath39 , which practice we adhere to in the rest of this section .",
    "the effective potential ( 4 ) as a function of @xmath0 is plotted in figure 1 for three different temperatures : the critical one and 1% above and below it .",
    "this displays the traditional behavior of a strong first order phase transition .",
    "the plot includes negative values of @xmath0 which may or may not be allowable , depending on the origin of @xmath0 and its physical interpretation .    the free energy density ( 5 ) as a function of @xmath0 is plotted in figure 2 for the same temperatures .",
    "the only difference between this and figure 1 is the addition of the pressure as evaluated in the high temperature symmetric phase .",
    "the energy density ( 6 ) as a function of @xmath0 is plotted in figure 3 .",
    "it has a maximum at @xmath5 .",
    "this follows directly from the expression for @xmath19 given earlier : for small values of @xmath0 the deviation from @xmath40 is quadratic in @xmath0 with negative curvature .",
    "note that the energy density goes negative when @xmath0 is greater than about 2.0 .    rather than using the field",
    "@xmath0 as the order parameter one might consider other choices more appropriate for the problem at hand .",
    "for example , one could take as the order parameter the deviation of the energy density from its equilibrium value and expand the free energy in a power series in this difference .",
    "this is the landau approach to the description of fluctuations and to departures from equilibrium states @xcite .",
    "such an approach to the nuclear liquid - gas phase transition was implemented by goodman _",
    "it is also this same function that was used in working out the nucleation of relativistic first order phase transitions by two of us @xcite . with these motivations we plot the free energy versus the energy in figure 4 by using @xmath0 as a parameter .",
    "there are a number of points to be made concerning this figure .",
    "first , there are two minima at each of the chosen temperatures",
    ". the minima occur at the energy densities @xmath41 and @xmath40 .",
    "the lower of these two represents the equilibrium state while the other represents a metastable state except at @xmath8 when they are degenerate .",
    "the value of @xmath1 at a minimum is equal to the negative of the pressure in that particular phase : @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "second , the value of @xmath44 !",
    "this is an indication of the inadequacy of the specific parametrization of the effective potential at this temperature , and probably at lower temperatures too .",
    "this is an important point to always be aware of when writing down any formula for an effective potential .",
    "third , the free energy has a cusp at the location of the high density symmetric phase .",
    "this is an unavoidable consequence of the inference of the free energy from the effective potential . from figure 3 or from the corresponding formula",
    "it is clear that the energy density is a maximum at @xmath5 .",
    "this means that the plot of the free energy ends at the equilibrium density @xmath40 of the symmetric phase with a cusp .",
    "physically this must be a restriction of fluctuations to those associated with @xmath0 and only @xmath0 .",
    "this is too restrictive by far ; there are certainly other physical processes not taken into account . for example",
    ", placing particles in a box in contact with a heat reservoir allows for the exchange of energy between the particles and the reservoir , resulting in fluctuations in energy and pressure .",
    "these processes are always present in systems at fixed temperature and are not accounted for , or associated with , fluctuations in an order parameter .",
    "now let us follow the landau construction of the free energy away from equilibrium states using the energy density as the order parameter with no reference to @xmath0 whatsoever .",
    "this is the construction made in @xcite in the context of constructing spherical surfaces separating two phases at noncritical temperatures .",
    "the total free energy of interaction is the sum of a gradient energy and a free energy density integrated over space . @xmath45\\ ] ] the @xmath1 is most economically written as a fourth order polynomial in @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath46 the coefficients are functions of temperature .",
    "they are determined by several requirements .",
    "the first is that @xmath1 has minima located at @xmath41 and @xmath40 , such that @xmath1 at those points be equal to the negative of the corresponding equilibrium pressure .",
    "@xmath47 this results in four equations involving the five @xmath48 .",
    "two more equations result from fixing the correlation length ( which is the same in the two phases only at @xmath8 ) and the surface energy @xmath26 ( which , strictly speaking , is only well defined at @xmath8 ) .",
    "this set of six equations is not inconsistent because the coefficient of the gradient energy , @xmath49 , must also be determined .",
    "@xmath50 we insist upon the same equilibrium energy densities and pressures as used in the effective potential approach , and use the same correlation length and surface energy at @xmath8 too . @xmath51",
    "\\\\ \\sigma & = & k \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty } dx \\ ,   \\left ( \\frac{d\\overline{e}}{dx } \\right)^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then the landau expansion of the free energy as a function of the energy density is obtained and is plotted in figure 5 .",
    "the @xmath52 is now a smooth and well - behaved function .",
    "its only failing is that the equilibrium energy density at @xmath53 is negative , but that is a consequence of insisting that it be the same as for the effective potential , which was negative .",
    "( actually , fluctuations into states with negative energy can be avoided if one uses the laurent expansion instead of the fourth order polynomial approximation @xcite , but only if the lower minimum is at positive energy density . ) in fact , with the landau approach we have a closer connection between the physical observables and the free energy .",
    "for example , we can easily specify the equilibrium energy density and pressure in each phase , making it simple to avoid such unwelcome behavior as a negative energy density in equilibrium .",
    "of course the direct connection with the condensate field @xmath0 is lost .",
    "the main difference between the two approaches is that the field theoretical approach parametrizes the out - of - equilibrium configurations in terms of an effective potential as a function of @xmath0 that shows smooth , quadratic minima around the two equilibrium states , whereas the landau type of thermodynamical approach does the same in terms of the free energy as a function of the energy density @xmath19 .",
    "these two approaches are not fully equivalent : the highly nonlinear @xmath54 dependence obtained from this particular field theoretical model does not yield a smooth quadratic minimum in terms of @xmath19 at @xmath55 ( where @xmath56 ) .",
    "this leads to unphysical estimates for energy density fluctuations , in our opinion .",
    "which approach one takes depends on the physical situation being addressed .",
    "a phase transition occurs because of some change in the global properties of the system .",
    "examples of such changes are : an expansion chamber or a sudden quench in temperature in the laboratory , the expansion of hot matter in a high - energy heavy ion collision , and the expansion of the early universe .",
    "generally we need to compare the phase transition rate to the rate of expansion or quench . the speed at which the phase transition proceeds comes into play when the speed at which the external variables , such as the volume , becomes comparable to or exceeds that of phase conversion .",
    "if the rate of change of an external variable is slow there is sufficient time to maintain phase equilibrium on a coarse - grained time scale .",
    "this also means that all other equilibration processes are completed as these invariably require less time and less interaction than the conversion of one phase of matter to another .",
    "thus , in the case of slow external dynamics and rapid phase equilibration the matter is in complete equilibrium , including phase equilibrium , and the equation of state of the matter undergoing a first order phase transition is given by the maxwell construction .",
    "then we have a fully developed mixed phase , and the phase abundances are typically given by the conservation of energy and entropy .",
    "no information on dynamical processes is needed .",
    "this type of transition is adiabatic . even in",
    "moderately fast dynamical expansions there are only small deviations from the ideal and complete phase equilibrium ( maxwell construction )",
    ". this deviation results in some delay in the creation of the new phase , leading to supercooling or superheating and extra entropy production .",
    "@xcite    for heavy ion reactions the first attempt to explicitly evaluate the phase transition speed of homogeneous nucleation was described in @xcite .",
    "the homogeneous nucleation mechanism correctly describes the initial stage of the phase transition when the abundance of the newly created phase is still small and when the rate of phase conversion is the slowest process .    here",
    "a couple of remarks are necessary .",
    "there are several requirements to form critical - sized bubbles or droplets of the new phase .",
    "both pressure balance and temperature equality should be established between the phases ; this requires the transfer of energy and momentum across the phase boundary .",
    "if local equilibrium is assumed both before and after the formation of the new phase then we can not relax the requirement of pressure and temperature equilibrium .",
    "langer s modern theory of nucleation yields the following formula for the rate : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the change in the free energy of the system due to the formation of the critical droplet .",
    "@xmath59 is a statistical prefactor which measures the available phase space volume .",
    "@xmath60 is a dynamical prefactor which determines the exponential growth rate of critical droplets which are perturbed from their quasi - equilibrium radius r@xmath61 .",
    "@xmath62\\ ] ] the dynamical prefactor has been calculated by langer and turski @xcite and by kawasaki @xcite for a liquid - gas phase transition near the critical point , where the gas is not dilute , to be @xmath63 this involves the thermal conductivity @xmath15 , the surface free energy @xmath26 , the latent heat per molecule @xmath64 and the density of molecules in the liquid phase @xmath65 . the interesting physics in this expression is the appearance of the thermal conductivity . in order for the droplet to grow beyond the critical size , latent heat must be conducted away from the surface into the gas . for a relativistic system of particles or quantum fields",
    "which has no net conserved charge , such as baryon number , the thermal conductivity vanishes .",
    "the reason is that there is no rest frame defined by the baryon density to refer to heat transport .",
    "hence this formula obviously can not be applied to such systems .",
    "the dynamical prefactor for such systems was first evaluated a la langer by two of us @xcite to be @xmath66\\ , .\\ ] ] here @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the shear and bulk viscosities , respectively , and @xmath69 is the enthalpy density difference between the two phases ( equal to the latent heat since the pressures are equal at the critical temperature ) .",
    "this fully relativistic expression was subsequently generalized by venugopalan and vischer @xcite to include a conserved baryon number .",
    "@xmath70\\ ] ] in the non - relativistic limit and when the viscosities are small compared to the heat conductivity this reduces to langer s expression . in the relativistic limit with no net baryon number , where effectively @xmath71 , this reduces to equation ( 21 ) .",
    "unfortunately there are several erroneous expressions for @xmath60 which subsequently appeared in the literature . in @xcite",
    "one finds that in the relativistic limit with no net baryon number @xmath72 this was `` derived '' under the assumption of vanishing shear viscosities .",
    "an expression for @xmath60 in the nonrelativistic limit with non - zero baryon number was found which differed from langer s result too . by including the viscosities",
    "another paper @xcite finds that @xmath73\\ , .\\ ] ] here @xmath74 is the speed of sound in the low density phase . in the limit",
    "that the viscosities vanish this reduces to the result of @xcite , and in the limit that they are large this reduces to the result of @xcite albeit with a factor of @xmath75 rather than 4 .",
    "the results found by @xcite and @xcite are suspicious because they predict a dynamical growth factor even in the absence of viscous forces .",
    "these results are wrong because of a misinterpretation of a derivative .",
    "both papers follow the approach of @xcite relatively closely except for one crucial point . at some point in the analysis one",
    "encounters the derivative @xmath76 evaluated at the radial profile @xmath77 of the energy density for a spherical bubble or droplet connecting the two phase .",
    "thus @xmath78 varies between @xmath79 and @xmath55 .",
    "the free energy density varies accordingly . as explained carefully and in some detail in @xcite , this derivative",
    "is taken at fixed temperature . at the equilibrium",
    "points it is zero : see the discussion in section 2 above . however , both @xcite and @xcite equate @xmath1 with @xmath80 irrespective of whether we are at one of the minima or not .",
    "they then assume an equation of state @xmath81 to finally obtain @xmath82 .",
    "from that point on the analysis diverges , and the erroneous results for @xmath60 inevitably follow .",
    "it is also possible to argue that the erroneous results for @xmath60 are not only mathematically incorrect but physically incorrect too .",
    "what is relevant is the slowest required process , not the fastest .",
    "furthermore it is incorrect to add up the rates of all processes to obtain the highest possible phase transition speed .",
    "if not all required processes are completed the phase transition is not complete either .",
    "for example to establish pressure ( momentum ) equilibrium @xcite is not sufficient , because then a subsequent step of establishing thermal equilibrium is required , and only when both processes are over has the phase transition been completed .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the slowest process , heat transfer via viscosity , was evaluated . in some cases , when we have non - negligible net baryon charge in our system",
    ", the heat conductivity may also contribute to the heat transfer to the new phase , thus speeding up somewhat this slowest of all processes @xcite .",
    "if the transport coefficients are all vanishing so that thermal balance can not be achieved , we will never reach both phase and thermal equilibrium , so the rate tends to zero as stated in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in case other degrees of freedom exist which permit energy transport between the phases leading to a common temperature @xcite , these processes can be combined with other transport processes like viscosity and/or heat conduction leading to faster temperature balance and a higher rate .",
    "however , sound waves do not lead to dissipation as perfect fluid dynamics is adiabatic ( in the absence of shock waves ) .",
    "thus , the sound wave as the sole mechanism can not characterize dissipative transport processes , as was mistakenly claimed in @xcite and @xcite .    a final remark : if the external dynamical evolution is much faster than the processes involved in the phase and kinetic equilibration then the matter involved in the phase transition loses both phase and thermal equilibrium , and we have to abandon the thermal and fluid dynamical approaches altogether .",
    "an example in the context of high energy heavy ion collisions is presented in @xcite where an effective field theoretical approach is used .",
    "generally this will be the case for small , rapidly developing systems only .",
    "in this paper we have examined two subtle issues in the dynamics of domain walls .",
    "one of them is the difference between the effective potential as a function of a scalar field and the free energy as a function of energy density , both evaluated near the critical temperature .",
    "the other involves a misconception in the literature about the derivation of the dynamical prefactor , or growth rate , in homogeneous nucleation theory .",
    "it is important to understand these subtleties because of their importance in such physical environments as cosmology , astrophysics and high energy nuclear collisions .",
    "this work was supported by the us department of energy under grant de - fg02 - 87er40328 and by the research council of norway ."
