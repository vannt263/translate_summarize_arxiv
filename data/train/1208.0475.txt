    "the numerical analysis and computation of stochastic partial differential equations ( spdes ) have become a subject of active research over the recent past .",
    "the interest has been triggered partly by applications in areas as diverse as geophysics @xcite and mathematical finance @xcite , and has led to questions regarding the complexity theory of their approximation @xcite .    in a prominent class of spdes ,",
    "the stochasticity enters via a random driver of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a linear elliptic operator , e.g.  the laplace operator , @xmath2 a martingale driver , often standard brownian motion , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 non - linear functions , e.g.  with lipschitz regularity .",
    "this leads to special cases with additive or multiplicative noise terms .",
    "we will consider here a variant of equation ( [ stdspde ] ) .",
    "typical solutions are by lattice methods , e.g.@xcite , finite differences , e.g.  @xcite , or by finite elements , see e.g.  @xcite , with extensions to higher order taylor schemes @xcite , as well as multilevel schemes @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "let @xmath5 a probability space , @xmath2 a one - dimensional standard brownian motion adapted to @xmath6 .",
    "we study specifically the equation @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are real - valued parameters .",
    "it is a classical result from @xcite that for a class of parabolic spdes including ( [ spde ] ) , with initial data in @xmath10 , there is a unique weak solution @xmath11 .",
    "in fact , for the special form ( [ spde ] ) on @xmath12 , i.e.  without boundaries , it is easy to see that a solution is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the solution to the heat equation @xmath15 with the same initial data as ( [ spde ] ) .",
    "we will use this semi - analytical solution to measure the errors of numerical approximations .",
    "we list two applications of this equation .",
    "@xcite show that ( [ spde ] ) describes the limit empirical measure of a large particle system , where each individual particle is governed by @xmath16 where @xmath17 are standard brownian motions , which are independent mutually and of the brownian motion @xmath2 .",
    "the parameter @xmath18 describes the correlation between each pair of @xmath19 , which explains the motivation for choosing @xmath9 in ( [ spde ] ) .",
    "we will see later that @xmath20 is a boundary case in the stability analysis .",
    "it is also clear how equations with non - normalised constant coefficients can be rescaled to ( [ spde ] )",
    ".    equation ( [ spde ] ) also arises as the zakai equation in a stochastic filtering problem ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) , where the solution is the distribution of a signal @xmath21 , based on noisy observation of @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite introduce a milstein finite difference approximation of ( [ spde ] ) and study the complexity of multi - level monte carlo simulation . in this article",
    ", we extend the discretisation and its analysis to an implicit method on the basis of the @xmath22-@xmath23 time - stepping scheme proposed and analysed by @xcite for sdes , where the drift and the deterministic part of the double stochastic integral are taken ( partly ) implicit . by combining fourier methods in @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we obtain a stability condition on the ratio @xmath24 , under which the approximations to the initial - value problem of ( [ spde ] ) converge in mean - square sense in the spatial @xmath25- and @xmath26-norms , of first order in the time - step @xmath27 and second order in the spatial mesh size @xmath28 .",
    "a peculiarity of equation ( [ spde ] ) is that the stability region of the chosen scheme is larger for explicit treatment of the milstein correction than for partly implicit treatment as explained above , and that an ` anti'-implicit version with negative weight of the implicit term gives unconditional stability .",
    "we find , both from an asymptotic expansion of the error and numerical experiments , that the numerical error is dominated by the stochastic terms of the equation and therefore implicit or even crank - nicolson - type versions of the scheme have little effect on the achieved accuracy .",
    "the ratio of @xmath24 , which gives , empirically , optimal accuracy for constant mesh sizes , is close to the stability limit of the explicit scheme .",
    "the improved stability can , however , be useful for locally refined schemes .",
    "the rest of the article is organised as follows . in section [ sec : finite - difference ] , we define the implicit milstein finite difference schemes and analyse their stability and accuracy by fourier techniques . section [ sec : firsttests ] presents numerical tests which confirm and illustrate these findings .",
    "section [ sec : results ] gives an application to the pricing of basket credit derivatives , where the presence of an absorbing boundary leads to local loss of regularity , and we show how mesh grading in conjunction with unconditionally stable implicit schemes can be used to improve the accuracy .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] gives conclusions and outlines directions for future research .",

    "note that all terms that can be taken implicit , consistent with the it integral , are taken implicit .",
    "implicitness of terms involving @xmath2 changes the character of the integral , e.g.  in the stratonovic sense for a trapezium rule approximation .",
    "we now analyse accuracy and stability of the above schemes .",
    "the analysis is done on the real line ( infinite grid ) , for analytical tractability , although in practical applications truncation to a finite domain and approximation on a finite grid will be necessary .",
    "we outline this at the start of section [ sec : firsttests ] and discuss the boundary behaviour in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "we assume for simplicity @xmath50 in the following , but the results are unaltered in the case @xmath51 , as we will discuss briefly in remark [ remark2 ] .    as per classical finite difference analysis ,",
    "e.g.  @xcite , we study simple fourier mode solutions of the form @xmath52 we use superposition of these solutions for different @xmath53 to construct the leading order error terms in the next section , and for now focus on the stability of individual modes .",

    "[ remark1 ] these results are similar but not identical to those obtained for scalar complex - valued test equations in @xcite , because the discretisation ( [ discreteimpl ] ) differs from the standard milstein scheme for systems of sdes , as per remark [ remark - mol ] .",

    "this arises from the fact that the implict discretisation of the it term on the second line of ( [ discreteimpl ] ) , containing @xmath75 , has the opposite sign of the implicit @xmath75 term on the first line , which arises from the discretisation of the @xmath76 term in the spde ( [ spde ] ) .",
    "the latter determines the parabolic nature of the problem .",
    "hence , increasing @xmath22 reduces this component in the implicit term while it increases it in the explicit term , making the scheme less contractive in the mean - square sense for all non - zero wave numbers , as is eventually seen from ( [ meansq ] ) .",

    "<S> in this article , we extend a milstein finite difference scheme introduced in @xcite for a certain linear stochastic partial differential equation ( spde ) , to semi- and fully implicit timestepping as introduced by @xcite for sdes . </S>",
    "<S> we combine standard finite difference fourier analysis for pdes with the linear stability analysis in @xcite for sdes , to analyse the stability and accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> the results show that crank - nicolson time - stepping for the principal part of the drift with a partially implicit but negatively weighted double it integral gives unconditional stability over all parameter values , and converges with the expected order in the mean - square sense . </S>",
    "<S> this opens up the possibility of local mesh refinement in the spatial domain , and we show experimentally that this can be beneficial in the presence of reduced regularity at boundaries .    : stochastic partial differential equations , finite differences , implicit timestepping schemes , fourier analysis , local mesh refinement </S>"
