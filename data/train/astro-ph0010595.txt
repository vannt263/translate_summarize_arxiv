    "the co molecular lines are useful to derive accurate rotation curves in the central regions of spiral galaxies , because of the high concentration in the center as well as for negligible extinction ( sofue 1996 , sofue et al 1997 , 1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "recent high - dynamic - range ccd spectroscopy in optical lines also make it possible to obtain high accuracy rotation curves in the central regions ( rubin et al 1997 ; bertola et al 1998 ) .",
    "however , in general , optical lines suffer from significant extinction by the central dusty disks , which is particularly signficant for highly - inclined and edge - on galaxies .",
    "hence , the co lines will be the most appropriate tool to investigate the central kinematics of spiral galaxies , if the angular resolution is sufficiently high . in this paper , we present recent high - resolution interferometer observations of co lines , and discuss the general properties of central rotation kinematics based on the high - accuracy rotation curves .",
    "position - velocity diagram along the major axis of ngc 3079 in co j=1 - 0 line at resolutions of @xmath0 ( top ) and @xmath1 ( bottom ) .",
    "note that the rotation velocity does not decline to zero at the nucleus , but remains always at finite value .",
    "uhc stands for ultra - high - density molecular core , and nmd for nuclear molecular disk .",
    "@xmath2 corresponds to 75 pc .",
    "in order to see if the central steep rise , or more likely non - zero start of the velocity , is indeed the case at higher resolutions than the current observations , we have performed interferometer observations at nobeyama in the co ( j=1 - 0 ) line of nearby co - rich galaxies . here , we present an example for the edge - on galaxy ngc 3079 , which exhibits a very dense central molecular core with various nuclear activities ( sofue et al 2000 )",
    ". the @xmath3co ( 1 - 0 ) observations of ngc3079 were made in january to april 2000 using the 7-element mm - wave interferometer at nobeyama , which consisted of the 6-element mm - wave array in a configuration linked with the 45-m telescope .",
    "we also obtained c and d - compact array observations , and all uv data were combined .",
    "1 shows the obtained pv ( position - velocity ) diagrams .",
    "the co line intensity distribution in ngc 3079 is summarized as follows : ( a ) an ultra - high - density compact and massive molecular core ( uhc ) of radius 125 pc and molecular mass of @xmath4 is detected at the nucleus .",
    "( b ) the core is embedded in a warped nuclear molecular disk ( nmd ) of radius 900 pc , and the disk has two spiral arms .",
    "( c ) an outer disk extending for more than 2 kpc along the major axis .",
    "2 ( left ) .",
    "rotation curve of ngc 3079 , compared with that of the milky way and ngc 6946 .",
    "3 ( right ) .",
    "smd ( surface mass density ) distribution in ngc 3079 .",
    "fig . 1 shows the obtained pv diagrams for the central regions of ngc 3079 , where the central uhc and nmd are resolved out both in the velocity and space .",
    "the uhc shows up as an intense pv ridge near the center .",
    "the rotation velocity of the molecular core increases toward the nucleus , and the velocity does not decline to zero at the center , indicating that the rotation curve starts from a finite value already at the center with at about 300  or greater .",
    "the warped nuclear disk shows up as an inclined ridge in the pv diagram , representing two - armed spiral arms .",
    "the radius of this disk component is @xmath5 , or the total radius is about @xmath6 pc .",
    "the main disk of the galaxy in the pv diagram shows up as two fainter ridges with smaller relative velocities , bifurcating from the main ridge of the nuclear disk .",
    "these bifurcated ridges show roughly rigid rotation , but at slower velocities , which represents foreground / background spiral arms .",
    "we also notice a velocity displacement between the two arm - like features , which may represent non - circular motion driven by the spiral density waves .    using the pv diagram",
    ", we derived a central rotation curve , and combined it with the existing data ( e.g. those from irwin and seaquest 1991 ) to obtain total rotation curve as shown in fig .",
    "2 . the rotation velocity starts from a finite value of about 300 , and declines to a first minimum of about 200  at 30@xmath7 ( 2.5 kpc ) radius .",
    "it is then followed by a broad disk maximum of @xmath8 at 5 to 10 kpc , and then by a declining outermost rotation .    using the rotation curve",
    ", we can derive a differential surface mass density as a function of radius by applying the method developed by takamiya and sofue ( 1999 ) .",
    "the surface mass densitu ( smd ) increases steeply toward the center , indicating high density cores with @xmath9 pc@xmath10 .",
    "since ngc 3079 is an sc galaxy with a poor central bulge , the high mass density could infer a concentration of invisible ( dark ) mass in the central region .",
    "high - accuracy rotation curves of sb , sc , sbb and sbc galaxies .",
    "4 we reproduce well - sampled rotation curves obtained by combining co , ccd h@xmath11 , and hi observations from our current study ( sofue et al 1999 ) . from figs . 2 , 3 and 4 , particularly from the case for the highest - quality rotation curves for ngc 3079 , we may summarize the universal properties of rotation curves as follows .",
    "( 1)massive galaxies generally show very steep rise of rotation in the central region .",
    "mostly likely , the rotation velocity starts from a finite value at the center , indicating a massive core at the nucleus .",
    "( 2 ) small - mass galaxies with slowe rotation velocities , however , tend to show more gentle rise .",
    "( 3 ) the central rotation is followed by a central peak and/or shoulder corresponding to the bulge . ( 3 ) rc is then followed by a road maximum in the disk .",
    "( 4 ) the outer rc is flat , and sometimes declining toward the edge ."
