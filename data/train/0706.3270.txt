    "fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) state was predicted more than fourty years ago@xcite and has been intensively studied.@xcite fflo state is characterized by the formation of cooper pairing in a magnetic field with nonzero center of mass momentum @xmath0 : @xmath5 . up to now , various properties of the fflo state have been predicted.@xcite recently , a strong candidate of the fflo state , cecoin@xmath6 , has been discovered.@xcite this material meets necessary conditions for the existence of fflo state , namely being in the clean limit,@xcite two dimensional electric nature,@xcite paramagnetically limited upper critical field,@xcite and @xmath7-wave superconductivity@xcite , and is also known as a strongly correlated system .",
    "however , all previous studies of fflo state did not take into account the electron - electron repulsion beyond fermi liquid corrections .",
    "@xcite moreover , most of the studies of pairing symmetry of fflo state are based on the variational method .",
    "another aspect of the fflo state which has not been so emphasized is that since magnetic field breaks time reversal symmetry , singlet and triplet pairings should be mixed in the fflo state according to the pauli s principle , as in a ferromagnet attached to a singlet superconductor ( fflo - like state is expected to appear in the ferromagnet in ferromagnet / superconductor junctions).@xcite actually , it is predicted that fflo state becomes more stable by mixing @xmath8-wave pairing.@xcite    recently , it has been found that fflo - like state can also appear in surface superconductivity or noncentrosymmetric superconductors.@xcite starting from the discovery of heavy fermion superconductor @xmath9 , @xcite the study of noncentrosymmetric superconductors has recenlty become a hot topic in condensed matter physics .",
    "@xcite due to the broken inversion symmetry , rashba type spin - orbit coupling ( rsoc ) is induced in the noncentrosymmetric superconductors,@xcite and therefore spin - singlet pairing and spin - triplet pairing can be mixed in superconducting state .",
    "@xcite however , the study of fflo state in noncentrosymmetric superconductors is insufficient , especially from the viewpoint of strongly correlated systems .    in this paper",
    ", we study fflo state of superconductors with and without inversion symmetry based on the hubbard model on the square lattice near half - filling , using the random phase approximation ( rpa ) . by solving the linearized @xmath10liashberg s equations directly",
    ", we can elude the difficulty of variational method .",
    "we show that center of mass momentum @xmath0 tends to be parallel to @xmath1- or @xmath2-axis in the presence of inversion symmetry , while the @xmath0 vector tends to be perpendicular to the magnetic field in the absence of inversion symmetry .",
    "we also clarify that @xmath3-wave pairing is favored and the hetero spin triplet @xmath4-wave state is present in the fflo state in constrast to the superconductors only with rsoc .",
    "the triplet @xmath4-wave state is enhanced by magnetic field and the rsoc which stems from the reduction of the spin susceptibilities by the magnetic field and the rsoc .",
    "the organization of the present paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we explain our model and introduce @xmath10liashberg s equations with the rpa . in section iii , we present calculated results of the eigenvalue of @xmath10liashberg s equations and the gap functions . in section iv , a summary of the results in the present paper is given .",
    "we consider the square lattice without inversion center in a magnetic field oriented to the @xmath1-axis .",
    "the hubbard model can be written as @xmath11 here , @xmath12 represents two dimensional vector .",
    "we set lattice constant to be unity .",
    "the first term is the dispersion relation and the second term consists of the zeeman term with the energy @xmath13 and the rsoc with coupling constant @xmath14 .",
    "the third term represents on - site electron - electron repulsion .",
    "then , the bare green s functions have the following form in the 2@xmath152 spin space :    @xmath16    with matsubara frequency @xmath17 .",
    "the linearized @xmath10liashberg s equations with rpa in the weak coupling approximation are described as ( see also fig .",
    "[ f1 ] )    @xmath18    with @xmath19 , center of mass momentum @xmath0 , and inverse temperature @xmath20 . here ,",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 are spin and charge susceptibilities at @xmath23 , respectively , which are obtained by @xmath24 and @xmath25 . note that @xmath26 and @xmath27 are satisfied . @xmath28 and @xmath29",
    "are given by @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 and @xmath33 are defined as @xmath34 @xmath35 .",
    "notice that @xmath36 and @xmath37 are satisfied .    in the rpa",
    ", we take into account the contributions from bubble and ladder types of diagrams . @xcite in the above , @xmath28 and @xmath29 stem from the bubble type of diagrams , while @xmath38 and @xmath39 originate from the ladder type of diagrams ( see fig .",
    "[ f15 ] ) . within the rpa ,",
    "self - energy corrections and the frequency dependence of effective interaction are ignored .",
    "however , we can grasp the essence of the physics by the rpa .",
    "@xcite    by solving the @xmath10liashberg s equations , we can obtain the gap functions .",
    "we define singlet component of the pair potential and triplet one with @xmath40 for a later convenience as @xmath41",
    "in the following , we set @xmath42 and parameters as @xmath43 and , @xmath44 . here , @xmath45 and @xmath46 denote the temperature , k - point meshes and the band filling , respectively .",
    "for example , the magnitude of @xmath14 in cept@xmath47si is @xmath48.@xcite      let us first discuss the center of mass momentum @xmath49 in unit of @xmath50 in order to study the stability of the fflo state .",
    "the superconducting transition temperature is determined by the condition @xmath51 . since @xmath52 is a decreasing function of temperature , the state with larger @xmath52 is favored .",
    "thus , we study @xmath52 as a function of @xmath0 to obtain optimal @xmath0",
    ".    figure [ f2 ] shows the eigenvalue @xmath52 as a function of the center of mass momentum at @xmath53 . for small magnitude of the magnetic field , @xmath54 ,",
    "the state with negligibly small @xmath0 is favorable as shown in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ( a ) . for a large magnitude of the magnetic field ,",
    "@xmath55 , the finite momentum state with @xmath56 and @xmath57 is favorable as shown in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ( b ) .",
    "therefore , the vector @xmath0 tends to be directed to @xmath1-axis .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath0 is given by @xmath58 . in order to study the validity of this relation , we show magnitude of the @xmath0 vector as a function of @xmath13 in fig .",
    "the approximate relation @xmath58 holds for wide range of @xmath13 . note that the same result can be obtained by exchanging @xmath59 by @xmath60 , @xmath59 by @xmath61 , or @xmath60 by @xmath62 due to the four fold symmetry of the square lattice .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the @xmath0 vector is likely to be parallel to @xmath1- or @xmath2-axis .",
    "@xcite    a similar plot in the presence of the rsoc is shown in fig . [ f3 ] , where we choose @xmath55 and @xmath63 . in this case",
    ", the vector @xmath0 tends to have a finite value ( @xmath64 ) and be parallel to @xmath2-axis .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath0 is roughly given by @xmath58 . note that finete momentum state is unfavorable in the presence of the rsoc but the absence of the magnetic field as shown in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] , where we choose @xmath65 and @xmath63 .",
    "the state with @xmath0 and that with @xmath66 are not degenerate due to the inversion asymmetry as shown in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] , where @xmath52 is plotted for all @xmath60 .",
    "the direction of the vector @xmath0 can be understood by the structure of split fermi surfaces .",
    "figure [ f6 ] depicts fermi surfaces at @xmath55 , with ( a ) @xmath53 and ( b ) @xmath63 .",
    "it is mentioned in refs.@xcite that the good nesting vector is important for the fflo state as can be seen from the term @xmath67 in the linearized @xmath10liashberg s equations .",
    "the summation over @xmath68 in @xmath67 leads to the term @xmath69 with @xmath70 .",
    "when this term has a large value , @xmath71 should be satisfied ( otherwise the numerator of this term becomes negligible ) .",
    "therefore , the nesting vector @xmath0 should connect nearest fermi surfaces and can not be @xmath72 .",
    "thus , we see that @xmath0 vector tends to be parallel to @xmath1- or @xmath2-axis for @xmath53 and to @xmath2-axis for nonzero @xmath14 as described by arrows in fig .",
    "we can also understand the result for nonzero @xmath14 as follows .",
    "since larger fermi surface moves to the van hove singularity @xmath73 and the smaller one moves to the opposite direction with the increase of the rsoc as shown in fig .",
    "[ f6](b ) , the formation of cooper pairing on the larger fermi surface , which has a finite momentum parallel to @xmath2-axis , contributes dominantly to the superconductivity .",
    "thus , @xmath0 vector is oriented to @xmath2-axis for nonzero @xmath14 . with a similar analysis",
    ", we can expect that @xmath0 vector tends to be perpendicular to the magnetic field in the presence of the rsoc for arbitrary direction of magnetic field .",
    "for magnetic field , @xmath74 , the dispersion relations become @xmath75 then , @xmath76 is satisfied when split fermi surfaces intersect with each other .",
    "this indicates that split fermi surfaces move to the opposite directions which are perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "hence , we see that @xmath0 vector tends to be perpendicular to the magnetic field in the presence of the rsoc , as predicted in other works.@xcite    it should be remarked that @xmath52 is reduced as @xmath13 or @xmath14 increase . hence , the superconducting transition temperature is reduced with the increase of them .",
    "this can be also predicted by the reduction of spin susceptibilities ( see fig .",
    "[ f10 ] and fig .",
    "[ f13 ] ) .      here ,",
    "we study gap functions which are normalized by the maximum value of @xmath77 as a function of wave vector @xmath12 .",
    "note that @xmath78 and @xmath79 are satisfied due to the weak coupling approximation .",
    "it is well known that singlet @xmath7-wave pairing is dominant over other pairings in the absence of magnetic field and rsoc.@xcite    figure [ f7 ] displays real and imaginary parts of the gap function @xmath80 at @xmath55 .",
    "we take @xmath53 with @xmath56 and @xmath57 in the upper figure and @xmath63 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 in the lower figures , where @xmath52 takes its maximum value ( see fig .",
    "[ f2 ] and fig .",
    "as shown in this figure , it has a @xmath4-wave symmetry .",
    "note that the imaginary part of @xmath80 is absent for @xmath53 .",
    "we see that the magnitude of @xmath80 is enhanced by magnetic field and rsoc .",
    "we show the real part of triplet gap function @xmath83 in fig .",
    "we also take @xmath53 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 in the upper figure and @xmath63 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 in the lower figure .",
    "as can be seen from this figure , it has a @xmath4-wave like symmetry .",
    "note that in the absence of magnetic field but the presence of the rsoc , @xmath83 vanishes .",
    "@xcite we show the real part of singlet gap function @xmath84 in fig .",
    ". we can find that it has a @xmath7-wave symmetry .",
    "we can understand the appearance of @xmath4-wave symmetry in triplet components by the structures of the spin and charge susceptibilities ( @xmath85 and @xmath86 ) .",
    "they have peaks near @xmath87 as shown in fig .",
    "[ f10 ] . according to eq.([gammauu ] ) , the gap functions tend to have the same sign during the scattering process .",
    "similar discussion is also applicable to @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( see figs .",
    "[ f11 ] and [ f12 ] ) , and also eq.([gamma ] ) . therefore",
    ", @xmath4-wave symmetry is favored .",
    "we show typical scattering processes toward @xmath88 by yellow arrows in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] and fig .",
    "[ f8 ] .",
    "let us explain the origin of the enhancement of the triplet pairing .",
    "we study @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , which are plotted in figs .",
    "[ f10]- [ f12 ] . @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ f10 ] , @xmath85 is reduced by magnetic field and rsoc while @xmath86 is almost independent of them .",
    "this can be intuitively interpreted as follows .",
    "magnetic field and spin - orbit coupling cause spin flip process and hence break magnetic fluctuation . on the other hand , spin flip scattering does not affect charge fluctuation .",
    "therefore , @xmath85 depends on magnetic field and the rsoc while @xmath86 is almost independent of them . since the positions of the peaks in @xmath85 and @xmath86 are almost the same",
    ", they compete with each other ( see eq.([gamma ] ) ) .",
    "the decrease of @xmath85 leads to the reduction of singlet @xmath7-wave pairing and hence triplet pairings could dominate.@xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ f11 ] , @xmath38 , which contributes to the effective interaction for the heterospin pairings , is also reduced by magnetic field and the rsoc by the same reason , while the real part of @xmath39 , which contributes to the effective interaction for the equal spin triplet pairings , is enhanced by magnetic field and the rsoc .",
    "this results in the enhancement of the triplet components .",
    "note that the imaginary part of @xmath39 emerges at @xmath55 and @xmath63 , although it is negligibly small except for the case in the presence of both of magnetic field and the rsoc .",
    "next , we discuss the spin susceptibility for the @xmath1-direction , @xmath89 , and that for the @xmath2-direction , @xmath90 . the susceptibility for the @xmath91-direction @xmath92",
    "is defined as @xmath93 .",
    "we see that magnetic field strongly suppresses @xmath94 , while the rsoc strongly suppresses @xmath95 and @xmath92 : @xmath96 at @xmath55 and @xmath53 , and @xmath97 at @xmath55 and @xmath63 , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ f10 ] and fig . [ f13 ] .",
    "since the spin susceptibilities have peaks near @xmath87 , the fflo state coexists with antiferromagnetic fluctuation .",
    ".pairing symmetry and center of mass momentum . here ,",
