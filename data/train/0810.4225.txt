    "_ ( approximate ) nonnegative matrix factorization _",
    "( nmf ) is the problem of approximating a given nonnegative matrix by the product of two low - rank nonnegative matrices : given a matrix @xmath0 , one has to compute two low - rank matrices @xmath1 such that @xmath2 this problem was first introduced in 1994 by paatero and tapper @xcite , and more recently received a considerable interest after the publication of two papers by lee and seung @xcite .",
    "it is now well established that nmf is useful in the framework of compression and interpretation of nonnegative data ; it has for example been applied in analysis of image databases , text mining , interpretation of spectra , computational biology and many other applications ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) . +",
    "how can one interpret the outcome of a nmf ?",
    "assume each column @xmath3 of matrix @xmath4 represents an element of a data set : expression ( [ approx ] ) can be equivalently written as @xmath5 where each element @xmath3 is decomposed into a nonnegative linear combination ( with weights @xmath6 ) of nonnegative basis elements ( @xmath7 , the columns of @xmath8 ) .",
    "nonnegativity of @xmath8 allows interpretation of the basis elements in the same way as the original nonnegative elements in @xmath4 , which is crucial in applications where the nonnegativity property is a requirement ( e.g. where elements are images described by pixel intensities or texts represented by vectors of word counts )",
    ". moreover , nonnegativity of the weight matrix @xmath9 corresponds to an essentially additive reconstruction which leads to a _ part - based representation _ : basis elements will represent similar parts of the columns of @xmath4 .",
    "sparsity is another important consideration : finding sparse factors improves compression and leads to a better part - based representation of the data @xcite .",
    "we start this paper with a brief introduction to the nmf problem : section  [ nmf ] recalls existing complexity results , introduces two well - known classes of methods : multiplicative updates @xcite and hierarchical alternating least squares @xcite and proposes a simple modification to guarantee their convergence .",
    "the central problem studied in this paper , nonnegative factorization ( nf ) , is a generalization of nmf where the matrix to be approximated with the product of two low - rank nonnegative matrices is not necessarily nonnegative .",
    "nf is introduced in section  [ secnf ] , where it is shown to be np - hard for any given factorization rank , using a reduction to the problem of finding a maximum edge biclique .",
    "stationary points of the nf problem used in that reduction are also studied .",
    "this section ends with a generalization of the nmf multiplicative updates rules to the nf problem and a proof of their convergence .",
    "this allows us to shed new light on the standard multiplicative updates for nmf : a new interpretation is given in section  [ intermu ] , which explains the relatively poor performance of these methods and hints at possible improvements .",
    "finally , section  [ mbfa ] introduces a new type of biclique finding algorithm that relies on the application of multiplicative updates to the equivalent nf problem considered earlier .",
    "this algorithm only requires a number of operations proportional to the number of edges of the graph per iteration , and is shown to perform well when compared to existing methods .",
    "given a matrix @xmath10 and an integer @xmath11 , the _ nmf optimization problem _ using the frobenius norm is defined as @xmath12 @xmath13 denotes the set of real matrices of dimension @xmath14 ; @xmath15 the set of nonnegative matrices i.e. @xmath13 with every entry nonnegative , and @xmath16 the zero matrix of appropriate dimensions . + a wide range of algorithms have been proposed to find approximate solutions for this problem ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "most of them use the fact that although problem   is not convex , its objective function is convex separately in each of the two factors @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( which implies that finding the optimal factor @xmath8 corresponding to a fixed factor @xmath9 reduces to a convex optimization problem , and vice - versa ) , and try to find good approximate solutions by using alternating minimization schemes .",
    "for instance , nonnegative least squares ( nnls ) algorithms can be used to minimize ( exactly ) the cost function alternatively over factors @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "actually , there exist other partitions of the variables that preserve convexity of the alternating minimization subproblems : since the cost function can be rewritten as @xmath17 , it is clearly convex as long as variables do not include simultaneously an element of a column of @xmath8 and an element of the corresponding row of @xmath9 ( i.e. @xmath18 and @xmath19 for the same index @xmath20 ) .",
    "therefore , given a subset of indexes @xmath21 , is clearly convex for both the following subsets of variables @xmath22 and its complement @xmath23    however , the convexity is lost as soon as one column of @xmath8 ( @xmath24 ) and the corresponding row of @xmath9 ( @xmath25 ) are optimized simultaneously , so that the corresponding minimization subproblem can no longer be efficiently solved up to global optimality .",
    "vavasis studies in @xcite the algorithmic complexity of the nmf optimization problem ; more specifically , he proves that the following problem , called _ _ exact nonnegative matrix factorization _ _ , which is the minimum value of @xmath26 for which there exists @xmath27 and @xmath28 such that @xmath29 ( see @xcite ) .",

    "the np - hardness proof for exact nmf relies on its equivalence with a np - hard problem in polyhedral combinatorics , and requires both the dimensions of matrix @xmath4 and its rank @xmath30 to increase to obtain np - hardness . in contrast , in the special cases when rank @xmath30 is equal to @xmath33 or @xmath34 , the exact nmf problem can always be answered in the affirmative :    1 .   when @xmath35 , it is obvious that for any nonnegative rank - one matrix @xmath0 there is nonnegative factors @xmath36 and @xmath37 such that @xmath38 . moreover ,",
    "the nmf optimization problem with @xmath39 can be solved in polynomial time : the perron - frobenius theorem implies that the dominant left and right singular vectors of a nonnegative matrix @xmath4 are nonnegative , while the eckart - young theorem states that the outer product of these dominant singular vectors is the best rank - one approximation of @xmath4 ; these vectors can be computed in polynomial - time using for example the singular value decomposition @xcite .",
    "when nonnegative matrix @xmath4 has rank @xmath34 , thomas has shown @xcite that exact nmf is also always possible ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "the fact that any rank - two nonnegative matrix can be exactly factorized as the product of two rank - two nonnegative matrices can be explained geometrically as follows : viewing columns of @xmath4 as points in @xmath40 , the fact that @xmath4 has rank @xmath34 implies that the set of its columns belongs to a two - dimensional subspace .",
    "furthermore , because these columns are nonnegative , they belong to a two - dimensional pointed cone , see figure  [ rank2 ] .",
    "since such a cone is always spanned by two extremes vectors , this implies that all columns of @xmath4 can be represented exactly as nonnegative linear combinations of two nonnegative vectors , and therefore the exact nmf is always possible is that a @xmath30-dimensional cone is not necessarily spanned by a set of @xmath30 vectors when @xmath41 . ] .",

    "hence , when the optimal rank - two approximation of matrix @xmath4 is nonnegative , the nmf optimization problem with @xmath44 can be solved in polynomial time . however , this optimal rank - two approximation is not always nonnegative , so that the complexity of the nmf optimization in the case @xmath44 is not known .",
    "furthermore , to the best of our knowledge , the complexity of the exact nmf problem and the nmf optimization problem are still unknown for any fixed rank @xmath26 or @xmath30 greater than  @xmath45 .      in their seminal paper @xcite , lee and seung",
    "propose multiplicative update rules that aim at minimizing the frobenius norm between @xmath4 and @xmath46 . to understand the origin of these rules , consider the karush - kuhn - tucker first - order optimality conditions for @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the hadamard ( component - wise ) product between two matrices , and @xmath49 injecting ( [ gradf ] ) in ( [ mix ] ) , we obtain @xmath50 from these equalities , lee and seung derive the following simple multiplicative update rules ( where @xmath51}{[.]}$ ] is hadamard ( component - wise ) division ) @xmath52}{[v w w^t ] } , \\qquad   w \\leftarrow w \\circ \\frac{[v^t m]}{[v^t v w]}\\ , \\label{lsupdate}\\ ] ] for which they are able to prove a monotonicity property :    the frobenius norm @xmath53 is nonincreasing under the multiplicative update rules  .    the algorithm based on the alternated application of these rules is not guaranteed to converge to a first - order stationary point ( see e.g.  @xcite , and references therein ) , but a slight modification proposed in  @xcite achieves this property ( roughly speaking , mu is recast as a variable metric steepest descent method and the step length is modified accordingly ) .",
    "we propose another possibility to overcome this problem by replacing the above updates by the following :    [ epsmu ] for every constant @xmath54 , @xmath53 is nonincreasing under @xmath55}{[v w w^t]}\\big ) , \\qquad w \\leftarrow \\max\\big(\\epsilon , w \\circ \\frac{[v^t m]}{[v^t v w ] } \\big)\\ , \\label{lsupdateeps}\\ ] ] for any @xmath56 .",
    "moreover , every limit point of this algorithm is a stationary point of the following optimization problem @xmath57    see section  [ munf ] of this paper , where the more general theorem  [ nfmulteps ] is proved .",
    "cichoki et al .",
    "@xcite and independently several other authors @xcite have proposed to solve the problem of nonnegative matrix factorization by considering successively each rank - one factor @xmath58 while keeping the rest of the variables fixed , which can be expressed as @xmath59 where matrix @xmath60 is called the @xmath61 residual matrix .",
    "ideally , one would like to find an optimal rank - one factor @xmath58 according to the frobenius norm , i.e. solve the following problem @xmath62 but , instead of solving this problem directly , these authors propose to optimize column @xmath63 and row @xmath64 separately in an alternating scheme , because the optimal solution to these two ( convex ) subproblems can be easily computed in closed form , see e.g.  @xcite : @xmath65 this scheme , which amounts to a block coordinate descent method ( for which any cyclic order on the columns of @xmath8 and the rows of @xmath9 is admissible ) , is called _ hierarchical alternating least squares _ ( hals ) and it has been observed to work remarkably well in practice : it outperforms , in most cases , the other algorithms for nmf @xcite .",
    "indeed , it combines a low computational cost per iteration ( the same as the multiplicative updates ) with a relatively fast convergence ( significantly faster than the multiplicative updates ) , see figure  [ cbcl ] for an example .",
    "we will explain later in section  [ intermu ] why this algorithm performs much better than the one of lee and seung .",
    "a potential issue with this method is that , in the course of the optimization process , one of the vectors @xmath63 ( or @xmath64 ) and the corresponding rank - one factor @xmath66 may become equal to zero ( this happens for example if one of the residuals @xmath60 is nonpositive ) .",
    "this then leads to numerical instabilities ( the next update is not well - defined ) and a rank - deficient approximation ( with a rank lower than @xmath26 ) . a possible way to overcome this problem is to replace the zero lower bounds on @xmath63 and @xmath64 in and by a small positive constant , say @xmath67 ( as for the mu ) , and consider the following subproblems @xmath68 which lead to the modified closed - form update rules : @xmath69 this idea was already suggested in @xcite in order to avoid numerical instabilities .",
    "in fact , this variant of the algorithm is now well - defined in all situations because guarantees @xmath70 and @xmath71 at each iteration .",
    "furthermore , one can now easily prove that it converges to a stationary point .",
    "[ cdth ] for every constant @xmath54 , the limit points of the block coordinate descent algorithm initialized with positive matrices and applied to the optimization problem are stationary points .",
    "we use the following result of powell @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) : the limit points of the iterates of a block coordinate descent algorithm are stationary points provided that the following two conditions hold :    * each block of variables is required to belong to a closed convex set , * the minimum computed at each iteration for a given block of variables is uniquely attained .    the first condition is clearly satisfied here , since @xmath63 and @xmath64 belong respectively to @xmath72 and @xmath73 , which are closed convex sets .",
    "the second condition holds because subproblems   can be shown to be strictly convex , so that their optimal value is uniquely attained by the solutions provided by rules  .",
    "strict convexity is due to the fact that the objective function of these problems are sums of quadratic terms , each involving a single variable and having a strictly positive coefficient .",
    "looking back at subproblem  , i.e. approximating the residual @xmath60 with a rank - one term @xmath66 , we have seen that the optimal solution separately for both @xmath63 and @xmath64 can be written in a closed form . in the previous section , subproblem",
    "was then solved by a block coordinate descent algorithm .",
    "a question arises : is it possible to do better ?",
    "i.e. _ is it possible to efficiently solve the problem for both vectors simultaneously ? _ in order to answer this question , we introduce the problem of nonnegative factorization which is exactly the same as nonnegative matrix factorization except that the matrix to factorize can be _ any real matrix _ , i.e. is not necessarily nonnegative . given @xmath74 and @xmath11 , the nonnegative factorization optimization problem using the frobenius norm is : @xmath75 of course , this problem is a generalization of and is np - hard as well .",

    "we first show how the optimization version of the maximum edge biclique problem can be formulated as a rank - one nonnegative factorization problem .",
