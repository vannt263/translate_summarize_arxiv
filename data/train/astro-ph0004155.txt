    "dividing our line sample into subsamples of high ( @xmath173 ) and low ( @xmath174 ) redshift lines , we find marginal evidence for evolution in the intensity of the background , namely that the maximum likelihood background intensity is lower by a factor of about 1.9@xmath175 at lower redshift .",
    "the bdo results corroborate this , but with larger uncertainties .",
    "the factor by which @xmath9 is found to be lower at lower redshifts is 2.5@xmath176 .",
    "gravitational lensing could mimic a trend with redshift with about the same order of magnitude , if the high redshift subsample contains a significant number of unknown lenses .",
    "however , figure  [ fig : zlum ] suggests little if any trend for high luminosity objects to exist at high redshifts in our sample ; and the results of section  [ sec - npr ] indicate that the high luminosity objects do show a somewhat stronger proximity effect despite the fact that the measured background at high redshift appears to be _ higher_. no other studies have found this evidence of redshift evolution in the background , so we regard it as tentative ; and note that it will be interesting to see in future work if this trend can be shown to be real and if it extends smoothly to the low values of @xmath9 found at redshifts less than 1.5 .",

    "table  [ table - jnu ] lists the results obtained for the high and low luminosity subsamples of our data set .",
    "the values obtained for these subsamples are equal within the uncertainties .",

    "using equation  [ eq : gamint ] and @xmath139 , and assuming global qso spectral indicies of 0 , 1.5 , and 2 , the ionization rate found from our data corresponds to log[@xmath9]= -21.34 , -21.17 , and -21.12 , respectively .",

    "thus , we conclude that a significant contribution to the ionizing background from stellar uv emission is not required at this redshift .      on the basis of a curve - of - growth argument , one might expect that weak lines would show a more prominent proximity effect than strong lines .",

    "we expect that for lines with @xmath179 0.32 @xmath3 , the effects of blending are reduced somewhat , while the curve - of - growth effects will remain a factor .",

    "the cloudy simulations discussed above indicate that allowing for an absorber metal abundance of 10@xmath167 solar has little effect on the value of @xmath9 found from the data .",
    "dust in intervening absorption systems may have affected our result . though we were unable to quantify this effect with high confidence , it could be on the order of a factor of 2 .",

    "recent models of the ionizing background include not only the integrated emission from qsos but also a variety of other physical processes such as star formation in young , high redshift galaxies and attenuation of uv photons by ly@xmath4 absorbers and lyman limit systems ( miralda - escud & ostriker 1990 , madau 1991 , 1992 , meiksin & madau 1993 , haardt & madau 1996,fardal et al .",

    "this work has demonstrated that the space density of radio - loud qsos decreases rapidly with redshift beyond z@xmath23 . since these surveys are unaffected by any presence of dust in the intervening igm ; and since they confirm the behavior seen in optically selected surveys , they indicate that the qso population is truly declining at high redshift .",
    "nevertheless , the discovery of qsos with redshifts greater than 4 has brought better agreement between the values of @xmath9 found via the proximity effect and the values predicted by the models with qsos primarily contributing to the background ( madau 1992 , meiksin & madau 1993 , haardt & madau 1996 ) .",
    "madau ( 1992 ) and meiksin & madau ( 1993 ) estimate the qso uv background by integrating the qso luminosity function ( boyle 1991 ) and including the effects of attenuation by hydrogen in the igm .",

    "their estimated qso contribution to @xmath9 is 3 orders of magnitude greater than that expected from galaxies .",
    "our measurement of @xmath9 is consistent with the uv background being qso dominated in the models of both these authors and haardt & madau ( 1996 ) .    in the models of madau",
    "et al . ( 1999 ) , the scenario changes at z @xmath195 3.5 . at this redshift , the qso contribution of ionizing photons falls below the critical limit needed to photoionize the igm ; and by z=5 , it will fall short of the critical value by a factor of @xmath24 .",
    "this implies that at high redshift , the contribution from young stars may become the dominant contributor to the background , with the caveat that the space density of star - forming galaxies would have to be maintained at the level observed at z @xmath0 3 , and that most of their uv photons would have to be free to escape into the igm .",

    "the discrepancies between this model at low and high redshifts ( kulkarni & fall 1993 , williger et al . 1994 ) indicate that the contribution to the background from galaxies may be of larger relative importance .",
    "we plan to undertake an analysis of the proximity effect at low redshifts from a large sample of qso spectra taken with the faint object spectrograph on the hubble space telescope to place better constraints on the background at 0.5 @xmath182 z @xmath182 2 .",

    "<S> the significance does depend on qso luminosity , in accordance with the theory that this effect is caused by enhanced ionization of hydrogen in the vicinity of the qso from uv photons from the qso itself . </S>",
    "<S> the photoionization model of bajtlik , duncan , & ostriker permits an estimate of the mean intensity of the extragalactic background radiation at the lyman limit . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the results of this standard analysis with those obtained using a maximum likelihood technique . if the spectrum of the background is assumed to be identical to that of each individual qso , and if this background is assumed to be constant over the redshift range @xmath8 , then the best fit value for @xmath9 is found to be 1.4@xmath10 @xmath11 10@xmath12 ergs s@xmath13 @xmath14 hz@xmath13 sr@xmath13 , using qso redshifts based on the ly@xmath4 emission line . </S>",
    "<S> systemic qso redshifts based on the [ oiii ] @xmath155007 emission line for 19 objects in our sample show an average redshift of @xmath2400 km s@xmath13 with respect to ly@xmath4 emission . </S>",
    "<S> using redshifts based on [ oiii ] or mg ii for the 35 objects for which they are measured and adding 400 km s@xmath13 to the remaining qso ly@xmath4 redshifts gives a lower value of @xmath9 , 7.0@xmath16 @xmath11 10@xmath17 ergs s@xmath13 @xmath14 hz@xmath13 sr@xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> this value is in reasonable agreement with the predictions of various models of the ionizing background based on the integrated qso luminosity function . allowing for the fact that individual qsos have different spectral indicies which may also be different from that of the background , we use the standard methods to solve for the hi photoionization rate , @xmath18 , and the parameters describing its evolution with redshift . </S>",
    "<S> the best fit value for the hi ionization rate we derive is 1.9@xmath19 @xmath11 10@xmath20 s@xmath13 , in good agreement with models of the background which incorporate qsos only . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we use simulated lyman @xmath4 forest spectra including the proximity effect to investigate curve - of - growth effects in the photoionization model used in the analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the presence of lines on the saturated part of the curve - of - growth could cause our estimates of the background intensity to be overestimated by a factor of two to three . </S>",
    "<S> this large absorption line sample and these techniques for measuring the background and understanding the systematics involved allow us to place what we believe are the firmest limits on the background at these redshifts . </S>"
