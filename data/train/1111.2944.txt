    "liquid crystals ( lcs ) are fluids composed of anisotropic ( usually rod - shaped ) molecules that exhibit long range order . in the simplest phase , known as the nematic",
    ", the molecules tend to align in a common direction , called the director _",
    "n_. in this paper we use a cholesteric phase , in which the lc contains at least one component which is chiral so that the director adopts a helical structure through the lc . in a display , a thin layer of lc is enclosed between transparent substrates which contain electrodes to enable the application of a voltage .",
    "lcs behave as elastic media and will adopt the director configuration that minimises the elastic energy of the system .",
    "in addition the molecules have anisotropic dielectric properties so that applying an electric field will tend to cause them to rotate . the configuration adopted by the lc director",
    "will therefore be determined by the combination of the boundary conditions imposed by the inside surfaces of the substrates , as well as the interaction between the electric field and the lc molecules . in the devices considered in this paper the inside surfaces of the substrates",
    "are designed to induce homeotropic alignment , that is with the director orthogonal to the substrates .",
    "the thickness of the lc layer is chosen to be close to the natural pitch of the cholesteric lc , which is the distance over which the director undergoes a full rotation . under these conditions",
    "the natural tendency of the lc to twist is suppressed and the lc adopts a uniform untwisted configuration with the director orthogonal to the substrates .",
    "however , small perturbations to the system can upset this equilibrium and can cause the director to collapse into complex localised structures known as cholesteric fingers .",
    "these fingers consist of extended domains of twisted lc and a rich variety of structures and phases has been reported  @xcite .    in our system",
    "we perturb the equilibrium by applying a voltage .",
    "the lc that we use has a negative dielectric anisotropy , that is the dielectric constant is greatest for electric fields directed orthogonal to the long axes of the rod shaped molecules .",
    "the field , which is applied across the layer , tends to rotate the director away from the initial vertical state ( fig .",
    "[ lc ] ) , and as the director becomes more planar the natural chirality of the lc dominates resulting in the formation of cholesteric fingers .",
    "the anisotropic optical properties of the lc means that these fingers are clearly visible under an optical microscope . in this paper",
    "we enhance the contrast by adding dichroic dyes  @xcite .",
    "the fingers nucleate at defects or particles  @xcite in the lc and grow as the applied voltage exceeds a threshold and retract as it reduces below the threshold . for larger voltages the fingers start to branch , and",
    "as they fill the space the fingers start to repel each other .",
    "fingers have also been reported in other lc phases  @xcite and there have also been studies of isolated fingers which can propagate as a result of electroconvection in nematic lcs  @xcite .",
    "these propagating localisations in liquid crystal first attracted the attention of the unconventional computation community in early 2000s in the frame of collision - based computing .",
    "it was demonstrated in cellular automata models that worms in liquid crystals can implement basic logical gates when they collide with each other and either annihilate or deflect as a result of the collision  @xcite however no extended results were obtained at that time .",
    "recent work in hp labs has focussed on the interaction between lc materials and engineered microstructures  @xcite and some of these systems have shown the potential for engineering the nucleation and propagation of cholesteric fingers .",
    "these results inspired us to reconsider the concept of collision - based computing in liquid crystals and to expand a range of problems solved by the propagating and interacting fingers .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sect .",
    "[ experiment ] we describe how we make our samples and measurements and in sect .  [ model ] we show how to imitate space - time dynamics of lc finger propagation using mobile automata on lattices",
    ". the classical problem of the planar voronoi diagram is tackled by lc fingers in sect .",

    "[ concave ] .",
    "we describe a design of a one - bit half - adder implemented via collision between fingers and obstacles , and between pairs of fingers , in sect .",
    "[ adder ] .",
    "final thoughts of future lc finger computing devices are outlined in sect .",
    "[ discussion ] .",
    "devices were constructed using glass substrates coated with a transparent conductor layer made from ito . in order to control the nucleation of the cholesteric fingers we patterned polymer structures onto one surface .",
    "fingers tend to nucleate at the sharpest points on any structures .",
    "[ experimental ] shows a typical set of features : 40@xmath2 m diameter rings with 4 protrusions to seed the nucleation of fingers .",
    "the structures are 5@xmath2 m high and cover the ito on one substrate .",
    "they are made from su8 ( microchem corp . ) using photolithography .",
    "the surfaces of the two substrates are then coated with a thin polymer layer to align the lc homeotropically .",
    "to assemble the cell , the substrates are gently placed in contact so that the su8 structures set the cell spacing , and the substrates are sealed on two edges with uv curing glue ( noa73 from norland products inc . ) .",
    "the cell is then capillary filled with the lc mixture , with the cell heated to above the isotropic / nematic phase transition temperature to avoid the flow artifacts that can occur when filling with the lc in the nematic phase .",
    "the lc used was mlc2037 ( merck kgaa ) which was chosen as it has a negative dielectric anisotropy , and the filling was carried out at @xmath3c .",
    "it was doped with an additive ( 1.29% by weight of zli811 , merck ) to impart a chiral pitch to the mixture .",
    "the concentration of the chiral dopant was chosen so that the pitch was very close to the cell spacing , so that the homeotropic state was just stable .",
    "the mixture was then doped with a blend of dichroic dyes ( 1% by weight g232 , g241 and g472 from hayashibara biochemical laboratories , inc . ) .",
    "these enhance the contrast and make the fingers visible , without the need to use polarisers  @xcite .",
    "dichroic dyes are rod - shaped molecules that only absorb light polarised along their long axis .",
    "they align with the lc , so that in the quiescent state the lc and dyes are both aligned vertically .",
    "thus the dyes absorb very little light . when the fingers form , the lc and dyes at least partially align at a more planar angle , so that the dyes absorb more light and the fingers appear black .",
    "applying a voltage across the lc layer causes the fingers to nucleate from the sharp points of the structures .",
    "these then slowly extend while the voltage is maintained ( fig .",
    "[ experimental ] ) , and then retract when the voltage is removed .",
    "we use a 1khz sinusoidal voltage with an amplitude of around 1.5v . in the next section",
    "we describe a model that captures some of the behaviour of the cholesteric fingers .",
    "a mobile automaton is a tuple @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is an euclidean coordinate of the automaton , @xmath6 ; function @xmath7 transforms coordinates as @xmath8 and @xmath9 ; in models presented here @xmath10 .",
    "the automaton moves on a lattice @xmath11 .",
    "all nodes of @xmath11 are in state empty ( 0 ) initially . at each step @xmath12 of evolution time",
    "the nodes are updated as follows : for every @xmath13 : @xmath14 if there is an automaton @xmath15 with coordinates @xmath16 .",
    "the occupied state is absorbing .",
    "obstacles are also defined as domains of occupied states 1.        fig .",
    "[ experimental ] shows a sequence of microscope photos of fingers propagating away from a dense array of nucleation sites .",
    "as fingers approach each other they deviate from a straight path to avoid contact .",
    "we find that the fingers always tend to turn in the same direction , left in the case of figure 1 .",
    "we believe this is due to the natural chirality of the lc mixture . the model is based on these observations .",
    "an automaton @xmath15 chooses where to move as follows .",
    "if node @xmath17 empty ( 0 ) then @xmath15 moves into this node ; otherwise it rotates left : @xmath18 and its state @xmath19 is incremented .",
    "the exact angle of scattering is not known and may depend on many factors beyond our present knowledge .",
    "thus we adopted increment @xmath20 which @xmath21 is increased with until a free site for the next position is found .",
    "the automaton stops when @xmath19 exceeds a certain threshold of attempts .",
    "the mobile automata model is phenomenological .",
    "a mobile automaton moving in a two - dimensional discrete space very roughly imitates the tip of a lc finger propagating in a quasi - two - dimensional space being squashed between two electrodes .",
    "our model in no way competes with existing numerical models of lc fingers , see e.g. @xcite , but must rather be considered as a fast - prototyping tool in the design of lc finger computing algorithms .",
    "we qualitatively verified our model using experimental observations .",
    "for example if we consider fig .",
    "[ experimental ] .",
    "discs with four singularities / protrusions are arranged in a regular grid so that the protusions are aligned between neighbouring discs ( the protusions of four neighbouring discs describe a square array ) ( fig .",
    "[ experimental]a ) .",
    "when a voltage of 1.5v is applied , lc fingers nucleate near the protrusions ( fig .",
    "[ experimental]b ) .",
    "the fingers propagate along the original axis determined by the protrusions .",
    "when two fingers come into a head - on collision , each of them turns left ( fig .",
    "[ experimental]c  f ) . to imitate this experimental finding",
    "we regularly and uniformly distributed clusters of mobile automata in a two - dimensional space ( fig .  [ simulated ] ) .",
    "initially the four automata of each cluster have their velocity vectors angles @xmath21 oriented north , south , west and east ( fig .  [ simulated]a ) . when finger @xmath22 moving north collides with finger @xmath23 moving south the finger @xmath22 turns south - east , and finger @xmath23 north - west ( fig .",
    "[ simulated]b - d ) .",
    "similarly , the finger initially travelling west deviates south - west and the finger travelling east turns north - east .",
    "further changes of the fingers trajectories are attributed to subsequent collisions ( fig .",
    "[ simulated]ef ) .",
    "if the distance between the initiation sites of the fingers is large enough to allow for prolonged movement of the fingers the four neighbouring fingers form spirals ( fig .",
    "[ crosseslargerdistance ] ) .",
    "let @xmath24 be a non - empty finite set of planar points .",
    "a planar voronoi diagram of the set @xmath24 is a partition of the plane into such regions that , for any element of @xmath24 , a region corresponding to a unique point @xmath25 contains all those points of the plane which are closer to @xmath25 than to any other node of @xmath24 .",
    "a unique region @xmath26 assigned to the point @xmath25 is called a voronoi cell of the point @xmath25 .",
    "the boundary of the voronoi cell of the point @xmath25 is built up of segments of bisectors separating pairs of geographically closest points of the given planar set @xmath24 .",
    "a union of all boundaries of the voronoi cells determines the planar voronoi diagram : @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "voronoi diagrams are applied in many fields of science and engineering .",
    "a few books and conference proceedings are available on the theory and applications of the voronoi diagram  @xcite .",
    "construction of a voronoi diagram is a classical problem of unconventional computing devices .",
    "this was the first ever problem solved in a reaction  diffusion chemical computer  @xcite .",
    "the basic concept of constructing voronoi diagrams with reaction  diffusion systems is based on an intuitive technique for detecting the bisector points separating two given points of the set @xmath24 .",
    "if we drop reagents at the two data points the diffusive waves , or phase waves if the computing substrate is active , travel outwards from the drops .",
    "the waves travel the same distance from the sites of origin before they meet one another .",
    "the points where the waves meet are the bisector points ; see the extensive bibliography in  @xcite and mechanisms of bisector formation in chemical media in  @xcite .",
    "the voronoi diagram is also approximated in crystallisation - based processors  @xcite and colonies of acellular slime mould _",
    "_ p__hysarum polycephalum  @xcite .",
    "thus it is intuitive to ascertain how voronoi diagrams could be approximated with lc fingers .",
    "the behaviour of the fingers is voltage - dependent .",
    "when the voltage exceeds a critical voltage ( in this case 1.7 v)the fingers grow much more quickly and start to branch ( fig .",
    "[ brachingexperimental ] ) .",
    "recursively branching fingers form fronts or a phase boundary between a free space and the domain filled by fingers .",
    "fronts originating from different sources compete for space .",
    "when two or more fronts meet , they stop propagating .",
    "thus to approximate a voronoi diagram we place the seeding structures of fingers in positions of space corresponding to planar points from @xmath24 and increase the voltage to cause finger branching.the loci of space not occupied by any fingers represents the edge of the voronoi diagram @xmath28 . from experimental observation",
    "it can be concluded that the accuracy of voronoi diagram construction is improved where fingers are highly branched ( approximate a continuous expanding front emanating from a defined site ) .",
    "this can be achieved by controlling the voltage or maximising the density of fingers initiated by altering the geometry and positioning of the seeding structures ( for example compare construction in figs .  [ brachingexperimental]a and  [ brachingexperimental]b ) .",
    "the approximation of the voronoi diagram of eleven planar sites in mobile automata model of lc fingers is shown in fig .",

    "a concave polygon is a shape comprised of straight lines with at least one indentation , or angle pointing inward .",
    "the problem is to subdivide the given concave shape into convex shapes .",
    "the problem is solved by lc fingers as follows .",
    "fingers are generated at the singular points of indentations and the fingers propagation vectors are co - aligned with medians of the corresponding inward angles . given a concave polygon",
    "every indentation initiates one propagating finger .",
    "a finger turns left , relative to its vector of propagation , when it collides with another finger or a segment of the polygon . given a polygon with @xmath29 indentations , @xmath29 fingers will be generated . by following their `` turn - left - if - there - is - no - place - to - go '' routine and also competing for the available space with each other the fingers fill @xmath30 convex domains",
    ". at least one convex domain will remain unfilled .    in the example shown in fig .",
    "[ convexsubdivision]a , there are three indentations .",
    "they initiate fingers propagating  approximately  south ( @xmath31 ) , west ( @xmath32 ) and north - north - east ( @xmath33 ) .",

    "each finger forms a spiral and gets stuck inside the spiral at some point of its growth .",
    "the computation of the convex subdivision of a concave polygon is completed when all fingers cease moving .",

    "a collision - based computer employs mobile compact finite patterns and travelling localisations to represent quanta of information in non - linear media .",
    "information values , e.g. truth values of logical variables , are given by either absence or presence of the localizations or other parameters of the localizations .",
    "the localizations travel in space and when collisions occur the result can be interpreted as computation .",

    "localizations can collide anywhere within the sample space , there are no fixed positions at which specific operations occur , nor location specified gates with fixed operations .",

    "the reflectors are stationary structures or defects .",
    "they are artificial in a sense that they do not belong to the liquid crystal medium but are externally and intentionally introduced to deflect propagating fingers .",
    "we assume the obstacles are rectangular . in real - world implementations corners of the rectangular reflectors",
    "would generate additional propagating fingers , thus obstacles must be smooth e.g. circular or oval .",
    "however , our model is coarse - grained and therefore any oval reflector would be composed of small rectangles and perceived as a group of rectangles by the fingers .",
