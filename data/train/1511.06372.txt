    "the tidal disruption of stars was first proposed by theorists as an inevitable dynamical consequence of a supermassive black hole in the nucleus in a galaxy @xcite . while the first tidal disruption event ( tde ) candidates were discovered in archival studies of x - ray surveys ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the detection of tde candidates in high - cadence optical surveys such as cfht snls @xcite , sdss stripe 82 @xcite , pan - starrs1 @xcite , ptf @xcite , and asassn @xcite , have yielded light curves with excellent temporal sampling , such that predictions for the time - dependent radiation produced from the accretion flow in a tde are being confronted in detail for the first time .    while it is encouraging that the optical tde candidates have roughly the right luminosities , rates , and timescales predicted by basic tde theory , there are some major disagreements between the theory and observations that remain to be resolved",
    "i ) predictions for the evolution of the hot , thermal continuum in a newly - formed debris disk in a tde @xcite appear to be in conflict with the constant , relatively cooler ( @xmath5 k ) temperatures observed in the optical tde candidates .",
    "ii ) the optical light curve shapes seem to agree well with the rise time and canonical @xmath6 power - law decay expected from the fallback of debris from a tidally disrupted star , however , this is surprising considering the potentially long circularization timescales , especially in low - mass black holes @xcite , and the expected band effects in the optical from cooling of the emission with time @xcite .",
    "iii ) the total energies emitted are much smaller than expected for the tidal disruption and accretion of a star , and may suggest that either partial disruptions are common @xcite , or the fraction of debris that is available for accretion on to the black hole is much smaller than the fraction of initially bound debris @xcite    solutions for these discrepancies have been proposed in the literature , including temperature regulation via winds @xcite , invoking a reprocessing layer @xcite , a radiation - dominated nebula @xcite , or attributing the continuum emission directly to the circularization process @xcite .    here",
    "we present late - time observations of the tde candidate ps1 - 10jh ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter g12 ) .",
    "this tde candidate is of particular importance for two reasons .",
    "first , it has by far the best sampled uv / optical light curve of a tde candidate to date .",
    "second , its optical spectrum at peak was dominated by broad he ii emission lines , strongly suggesting that the photoionized gas did not originate from the quiescent interstellar medium in the vicinity of the smbh , or in a pre - existing accretion disk , but rather from the tidal debris of the disrupted star itself .",
    "our aim in this study was to measure the uv flux of the event at late times , in order to localize the transient relative to its host galaxy nucleus with the high spatial resolution of hst , and compare its continued decay with models for the evolution of the accretion flow over time .",
    "in addition , we obtained a deeper late - time spectrum of the host galaxy , in order to construct a more reliable host - subtracted spectrum of the nuclear transient .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present our hst observations in  [ sec : hst ] , and in  [ sec : analysis ] we use the late - time uv emission measured by hst to pinpoint its origin to the nucleus of the host galaxy and its central smbh , and probe the evolution of its light curve over a baseline of over 3 years after its peak . in  [ sec : spec ] we use late - time optical spectroscopy to perform a clean subtraction of the host galaxy contribution , and isolate the non - stellar continuum and emission lines powered by ps1 - 10jh . in  [ sec : disc ] we discuss the implications of these observations with respect to the geometry of the accretion flow , the evolution of its effective temperature with time , and the chemical composition of the star disrupted .",
    "we obtained hst observations of ps1 - 10jh on ut 2014 june 13 with wfc3 uvis in the f225w and f625w filters for 3.791 ksec and 5.014 ksec , respectively , with the goal of localizing the transient with respect to its host galaxy nucleus , and measuring its late - time uv flux .",
    "the source is clearly detected as a point source in the f225w filter , with no evidence of extended host emission , consistent with its deep _ galex _ pre - event imaging upper limit of @xmath7 mag ( g12 ) .",
    "the optical image is dominated by the host galaxy , and we use it to determine the precise position of the host galaxy centroid .",
    "we register the uv ( f225w ) and optical ( f625w ) images to each other using 7 reference stars in the field of view .",
    "we use the iraf routines geomap and geotran to calculate and apply a geometrical transform of the uv image to the optical image . after this registration",
    ", we find that the source is coincident with the optical host galaxy centroid within @xmath8 = 0.57 pixels = @xmath9 ( see figure [ fig : centroid ] ) .",
    "the host galaxy is well resolved in the optical image , and is fitted with elliptical isophotes with a de vaucouleurs surface brightness profile , and an effective ( half - light ) radius , @xmath10 .",
    "we perform aperture photometry on the uv image using the idl routine aper , using a @xmath11 radius aperture , and correcting for a fraction of 0.777 of the total energy enclosed at the filter effective wavelength of 235.9 nm , and find @xmath12 mag in the ab system , and @xmath13 mag in the _ galex _ ab system , measured from comparison to the _ galex _ ab magnitudes measured with a 6 arcsec radius aperture for 4 isolated point sources measured from a 28 ksec coadd ( 5@xmath14 detection limit of @xmath15 mag ) constructed from observations taken during the _ galex _ time domain survey @xcite .",
    "we show the uv / optical light curve of ps1 - 10jh from _ galex _ and ps1 in figure [ fig : lc ] , with the late - time hst epoch in the nuv ( f225w ) filter at mjd 56821.434 ( ut 2016 june 13.497 ) , or 3.35 rest - frame years from the observed peak of the light curve .",
    "we have improved the ps1 image differencing photometry from g12 using the methods of @xcite . making the ( not necessarily correct ) assumption that the emerging flux is directly proportional to the fallback rate",
    ", we fit the uv / optical light curve to models for the fallback rate , with different values for the polytropic exponent ( @xmath16 ) of the disrupted star , and the impact parameter of its orbit defined as @xmath17 .",
    "we show a fit to a model for a star with @xmath18 and @xmath19 model from @xcite presented in g12 , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 model following the methodology of @xcite ( j. guillochon , private communication ) .",
    "the time delay between the time of disruption ( @xmath22 ) in the models , and the peak of the fallback rate ( @xmath23 ) , are @xmath24 and 84 rest - frame days , respectively .",
    "the corresponding black hole masses for each model are @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "independent of these models at late times , but adopting their values of @xmath22 ( which is tightly constrained from the rising portion of the light curve ) , the uv decline of ps1 - 10jh is fitted with a power - law index , @xmath29 , with @xmath30 , in nice agreement with the analytical @xmath6 power - law calculated for fallback of tidally disrupted debris @xcite .",
    "the different black hole masses from the model fits are due to the different assumption in @xmath16 as well as @xmath31 . note , that these are fits to the fallback rate @xmath32 , and do not include radiative transfer or band effects .",
    "for example , even if the bolometric luminosity is tracking @xmath32 , the flux in a given band will depend on the evolution of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) with time .",
    "however , given the stable uv / optical colors in ps1 - 10jh over a year after peak , there is little evidence of cooling or of a changing accretion efficiency with time .",
    "thus with a fixed sed shape , both @xmath33 and @xmath34 will follow the decline of @xmath32 .",
    "remarkably , the late - time uv flux measured by hst continues to follow the decline expected from the fallback rate predicted by both models .",
    "this persistent @xmath6 power - law decline in the uv at late times again is evidence for both the lack of cooling ( or heating ) of the emission . while for a fixed radius the temperature of thermal emission",
    "would be expected to cool with a declining luminosity , the temperature of the emission might actually increase at late times due to a shrinking photosphere from a radiatively - driven wind @xcite . a change in the sed temperature would cause the uv light curve to flatten or steepen , neither of which is observed .",
    "furthermore , we do nt see evidence for viscous evolution , which is expected to occur on the timescale of tens to hundreds of years , and would result in a flatter power - law @xcite .",
    "the fact that the uv / optical emission so closely follows the fallback rate is in contradiction with debris disk models @xcite , and requires a reprocessing layer or outflow with a regulated temperature @xcite , and may be the natural behavior of a radiation - dominated wind @xcite or expanding nebula @xcite , albeit with an unphysical receding photosphere . alternatively , the optical emission may arise from the circularization process itself , and not accretion @xcite .",
    "while the larger emission radius in this scenario would produce an effective temperature well matched to ps1 - 10jh , the shock dissipation mechanism powering the emission is not expected to dissipate energy as smoothly , and monotonically evolving as observed in ps1 - 10jh .",
    "we obtained two additional late - time epochs of spectroscopy with the 6.5 m mmt blue channel spectrograph @xcite on ut 2012 september 1617 ( @xmath35 sec each night ) and 2014 april 28 ( @xmath36 sec ) .",
    "we used a 1@xmath37 slit at the parallactic angle @xcite and the 300 lines / mm grating , for a spectral resolution of @xmath1 5.5  .",
    "this was the same instrumental setup used for the day @xmath38 and @xmath39 observations in g12 . when we subtract the 2012 and 2014 spectra from each other , we find no significant differences within the errors . at these epochs",
    "the optical emission from ps1 - 10jh has faded by factors @xmath40 , and thus is no longer detectable above the host galaxy continuum .",
    "thus we coadd these late - time spectra to create a host galaxy template .",
    "note that we measure a balmer h@xmath2 absorption equivalent - width ( ew ) in the host galaxy spectrum of 2.3 @xmath41  , which does not classify the galaxy as a rare post - starburst e+a galaxy @xcite , as claimed by @xcite .",
    "we subtract the host galaxy plus a hot blackbody ( @xmath42 k ) at @xmath43 from the earlier spectral epochs presented in g12 , in order to remove the continuum from ps1 - 10jh and its host , and isolate its emission line features . the resulting difference spectrum in figure [ fig : spec ]",
    "is very similar to that presented in g12 , in which we used a stellar - synthesis galaxy template subtraction , although there is some loss of s / n due to the noise in the true host spectrum .",
    "we detect broad he ii emission lines at @xmath3 , and @xmath44 , including a `` blue wing '' to he ii @xmath454686 .",
    "this feature was also present in the original analysis , although we did not discuss it , since there was the possibility that this was an artifact from a template mismatch .",
    "now that it has been confirmed to be real , it could result from an outflow or other velocity structure in the emission line , or the presence of additional lines , such as the ciii / niii `` wolf - rayet '' blends seen in some supernovae ( sne ) when the the temperature is high ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the second component can be modeled as a second gaussian with a centroid near 4470  , which is too blue for the wr blends at zero velocity .",
    "note that tde candidate asassn-14li",
    "@xcite also very clearly has velocity structure in its he ii 4686 line , although it is double - peaked at a different velocity , so it is not the same line blended in the two objects .",
    "the most striking aspect of the spectrum is still the lack of obvious hydrogen emission lines .",
    "figure [ fig : ha ] shows a zoom in of the spectrum at the rest - frame velocity of he ii @xmath3 and h@xmath46 .",
    "dashed lines show the 9,000 km s@xmath47 fwhm of the gaussian fit to the he ii @xmath3 line measured in g12 . if we integrate the flux in this velocity range for both lines , we measure a ratio of he ii @xmath3/h@xmath48 . in figure",
    "[ fig : ha ] we plot gaussians with a fwhm= 9,000 km s@xmath47 that have this flux ratio . note that h@xmath46 at this redshift is in the wing of the telluric a band , which corresponds to wavelengths in the rest - frame of ps1 - 10jh of @xmath49  .",
    "furthermore , he ii has a line at 6560 (the pickering series @xmath50 ) , in wavelength coincidence with h@xmath46 , but it is expected to be only @xmath51 times the strength of he ii 4686 for photoionized gas @xcite . despite some of these systematic uncertainties , we do not find any significant residual emission at h@xmath46 .",
    "@xcite reported residual emission at h@xmath46 corresponding to he ii @xmath3/h@xmath46 = 3.7 based on a smoothed version of the model galaxy template subtraction we performed in g12 .",
    "however , our late - time spectroscopy now enable us to perform a direct host galaxy subtraction that is more accurate , and is still consistent with the he ii @xmath3/h@xmath4 ratio reported in g12 .",
    "h@xmath31 is more difficult to measure an upper limit for , since it is located within the red wing of the much stronger broad he ii @xmath3 line .",
    "the nuclear position of ps1 - 10jh in its host galaxy further strengthens its association with the host galaxy s central smbh , and disfavors a sn origin , or a microlensing event by a star in an ( unseen ) foreground galaxy @xcite .",
    "similarly , the persistence of the uv emission on the timescale of years is inconsistent with any known sn behavior .",
    "the continued decline of the uv light - curve at the rate expected for the fallback accretion of the tidally disrupted debris is incompatible with simple accretion - flow geometries , and requires an extended photosphere that evolves in such a way to keep the effective temperature fixed with time .",
    "the strong detection of broad helium emission , and lack of hydrogen emission , is difficult to reproduce in standard conditions for photoionized gas . in g12",
    ", we argue that the lack of hydrogen emission is a signature of a low hydrogen fraction ( @xmath52 ) for the disrupted star . however , helium stars are extremely rare , and even tidally stripped evolved stars retain a large fraction of their h envelopes @xcite , and would require multiple orbital passages of the smbh to completely unbind their h envelope @xcite .",
    "subsequent arguments have been made that avoid the problem of tidally disrupting a helium - rich star , by suppressing the hydrogen emission from a truncated broad - line region formed from the tidal debris of a main - sequence star @xcite , in particular , at certain densities where thermalization becomes important @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite find that these conditions in solar - composition photoionized gas are only sufficient to suppress the h@xmath46 emission enough to yield he ii @xmath3/h@xmath53 , or in the presence of velocity gradients in the gas , only up to he ii @xmath3/h@xmath54 , well below the line ratio we measure for ps1 - 10jh of he ii @xmath3/h@xmath4 . while recent calculations by @xcite find that certain conditions in an _ optically - thick _ extended reprocessing envelope in a tde could reproduce a ratio of he ii @xmath3/h@xmath55 , or even higher .    while at least one other tde candidate has a similar spectrum to ps1 - 10jh @xcite",
    ", there are also tde candidates reported with both hydrogen and helium broad emission lines @xcite , as well as neither ( only absorption ) @xcite .",
    "clearly , hydrogen emission is not suppressed in all tde candidates .",
    "while this may be a signature of the diversity in the hydrogen envelopes of disrupted stars , analogous to the hydrogen - free spectra of stripped core - collapse sne , the radiative transfer effects in the complex photoionized debris stream or disk may also be a natural explanation , and must continue to be investigated in more detail before stronger conclusions can be made . detailed spectroscopic monitoring of future tdes is critical for testing these models , directly probing the structure of the stellar debris in a tde , and providing insights on the population of stars in the harsh environment in the vicinity of its central smbh .",
