    "phase retrieval problems arise in many aspects of applied science including optics and quantum mechanics .",

    "recently , this family of problems has attracted a lot of attention in the mathematical community ( _ see e.g. _ @xcite or the research blog @xcite ) .",
    "a typical such problem is the phase retrieval problem in optics where one wants to reconstruct a compactly supported function @xmath16 from the modulus of its fourier transform @xmath17|$ ] .",

    ", we focus on the ( non ) uniqueness aspects of a generalization of pauli s problem in which one has phase - less measurements of fractional fourier transform ( frft ) as has been previously studied by the second author @xcite . recall from @xcite that the frft is defined as follows : for @xmath20 a parameter that is interpreted as an angle , and @xmath21 , @xmath22(\\xi/\\sin\\alpha)\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is a normalization constant which ensures that @xmath0 extends to a unitary isomorphism of @xmath24 .",

    "the fractional fourier transforms are adapted to the mathematical expression of the fresnel diffraction , just as the standard fourier transform is adapted to fraunhofer diffraction .",

    "the vocabulary comes from quantum mechanics ( _ see e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) . for sake of self - containment , let us now recall some basic notions from quantum mechanics .",
    "the description of a physical system is based on a complex separable hilbert space @xmath36 . for our purpuses ,",
    "we will denote by @xmath38 and @xmath39 the bounded and trace class operators on @xmath40 .",

    "the states form a convex set whose extreme points , the _ pure states _ are the one dimensional projections .",

    "it follows that , for any state @xmath41 , @xmath53 $ ] is a probability measure on @xmath47 . the number @xmath54 is interpreted as the probability that the measurement of @xmath55 gives an outcome from the set @xmath56 when the system is initially prepared in the state @xmath41 .",

    "a. vogt mentioned a conjecture by wright that there exists a third observables such that this observable together with position and momentum forms an informationnaly complete with respect to pure states family .",

    "then they extend a construction of @xcite to show that @xmath81 is not icps when @xmath82 is finite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide a somewhat similar result for an other class of parameters which is based on an adaptation of an unnoticed counterexample to pauli s problem due to a.e.j.m .",
