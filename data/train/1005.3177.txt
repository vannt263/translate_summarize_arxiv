    "the aim of this note is to present a number of ideas and questions related to the construction of quantum processes . for technical convenience",
    "we restrict ourselves to systems with a finite configuration space in a classical context or with @xmath0 accessible levels in the quantum .",
    "a reversible dynamics of such an isolated system is rather boring : a finite classical configuration space only supports jumps in discrete time while the evolution of a finite level quantum systems is almost periodic in time @xmath1 here , the summation runs over the bohr frequencies of the system , i.e. , the spacings between the energy levels of the hamiltonian and the @xmath2 are the fourier coefficients of the observable @xmath3 .",
    "the evolution of systems weakly perturbed by an environment can be reasonably described by a stochastic dynamics , even by a stochastic map @xmath4 if we only observe the system at regular time intervals .",
    "such maps will typically turn pure states into mixed states , a clear signature of their randomizing character . in the classical context we deal with matrices of transition probabilities and in the quantum setting with completely positive trace preserving maps .",
    "repeated action of the map on the states yields a dynamics @xmath5 , markovian in time . a generic @xmath4 has a unique invariant state @xmath6 into which any initial state is driven @xmath7    several figures of merit",
    "can be defined for this kind of evolution .",
    "two well - known ones are the spectral gap @xmath8 of @xmath4 that controls the asymptotic rate of convergence towards the invariant state @xmath9 and the minimal output entropy @xmath10 here @xmath11 denotes either the shannon entropy of a probability vector or the von  neumann entropy of a density matrix .",
    "a stochastic process in discrete time is a different object : it specifies joint probabilities at different times .",
    "more precisely such a process is a state @xmath12 on a half - chain @xmath13 .",
    "at each site of this chain sits a copy of our classical configuration space or of the quantum @xmath0-level system .",
    "we assume , moreover , that the chain is stationary : the state @xmath12 is invariant under a right shift .    in the classical case the process models a source that is emitting every time unit a letter belonging to the alphabet @xmath14 .",
    "the state @xmath12 specifies the probability that the source emits a given word .",
    "let @xmath15 be a random letter string emitted by the source at times @xmath16 then @xmath17    in the quantum context , the restriction of @xmath12 to the first @xmath18 sites of the chain is a density matrix on @xmath19 .",
    "this density matrix encodes all the statistical information that can be obtained by applying repeated measurements on a sequence of @xmath18 particles emitted by the source .",
    "the amount of randomness in the process up to time @xmath18 is quantified by the entropy @xmath20 for stationary processes @xmath21 satisfies sub - additivity @xmath22 .",
    "this implies the existence of the average entropy @xmath23 the quantity @xmath24 is also known as the dynamical entropy of the shift on the half - chain , it takes values in @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "it is a relevant measure of the randomness of the source as , under suitable ergodicity conditions on @xmath12 , length-@xmath18 messages can be reliably encoded in a subspace of dimension @xmath26 instead of @xmath27 .    using strong sub - additivity , @xmath28 ,",
    "more can be proven : the local entropy @xmath29 is increasing , while the entropy increment @xmath30 is decreasing .",
    "both properties fail for general non shift - invariant quantum states . as a consequence",
    "@xmath31 this means that @xmath24 is not only the compression rate of long messages but also the asymptotic entropy production of the source .",
    "the importance of  ( [ ent : pro ] ) is that it can be used as a starting point for computing @xmath24 .",
    "this happens for some markov - like constructions where a simple transfer matrix - like construction generates the @xmath18-steps marginal of @xmath12 from the @xmath32-th .",
    "e.g. , blackwell  @xcite has described a procedure for computing the entropy of hidden markov processes and we shall show that an analogous procedure applies to free fermionic processes .",
    "there are several routes that lead to classical markov processes , like extending two - party states or generating the process in terms of a stochastic matrix .",
    "we remind here a number of problems and results that arise in this context with quantum processes .",
    "we also present a general scheme for generating quantum processes in terms of a quantum operation on a @xmath0-level system .",
    "several examples are considered , in particular a free fermionic version .",
    "the configuration space of a classical register with @xmath0 states is just a finite set @xmath33 .",
    "the states are length-@xmath0 probability vectors @xmath34 the state space is a simplex and the extreme points are the dirac measures that assign a probability 1 to a configuration .",
    "the shannon entropy @xmath35 quantifies the randomness in the state .",
    "it is easily seen that @xmath11 is a concave function on the state space : @xmath36    restricting a state @xmath37 on a composite system @xmath38 to the subsystem @xmath39 returns the first marginal of @xmath37 @xmath40 the shannon entropy behaves well with respect to restrictions :    * monotonicity : @xmath41 , * sub - additivity : @xmath42 , and * strong sub - additivity : @xmath43 .",
    "we can now consider the following state extension problem .",
    "suppose that we are given two probability vectors @xmath37 and @xmath44 that agree on the middle system : @xmath45 .",
    "can we find a joint extension for @xmath37 and @xmath44 ?",
    "more explicitly : can we find a state @xmath46 on @xmath47 that restricts to @xmath37 on @xmath48 and to @xmath44 on @xmath49 ?",
    "this is indeed possible and clearly the set of joint extensions @xmath46 is convex and compact .",
    "we can therefore refine the question and ask for a joint extension of maximal entropy . a straightforward computation yields the answer : @xmath50 actually",
    ", @xmath51 saturates the strong sub - additivity inequality : @xmath52 unsurprisingly , there is a direct connection with thermal equilibrium states .",
    "if we introduce hamiltonians @xmath53 then @xmath54    let us start with a two - party probability vector @xmath55 that is shift - invariant : @xmath56 we can repeatedly apply the markov extension procedure  ( [ mar : ext ] ) to get a stationary process @xmath57",
    "another procedure is to start with a @xmath58 stochastic matrix @xmath59 .",
    "the entry @xmath60 is the probability for jumping from state @xmath61 to @xmath62 , therefore @xmath63 the invariant state @xmath55 is a row vector determined by @xmath64 .",
    "the markov process is now obtained by putting @xmath65 both constructions  ( [ mar : pro ] ) and  ( [ mar : pro2 ] ) agree if we put @xmath66    the rows of a stochastic matrix @xmath59 are probability vectors .",
    "the minimal output entropy of @xmath59 is simply @xmath67 while the entropy of the process is a smooth version of this quantity @xmath68",
    "when turning to quantum state extension the situation gets more complicated .",
    "quantum states allow for more freedom , as they exhibit correlations that are not present in classical systems , but this imposes at the same time more stringent positivity conditions .",
    "states on a full matrix algebra @xmath69 can be identified with density matrices : non - negative matrices with trace one .",
    "the convex set of density matrices is very unlike a simplex .",
    "a density matrix that is not an extreme point of the state space , i.e. , that is not a one - dimensional projector , allows many decompositions in extreme states .",
    "in contrast with classical systems such a state can therefore not be seen as a well - defined ensemble op pure states .",
    "we need @xmath70 real parameters to describe the state space of @xmath69 while @xmath71 parameters suffice to label the pure states .",
    "this means that the boundary of the state space contains many flat subsets .",
    "nevertheless the pure states form a very nice smooth manifold .",
    "the case of a single qubit is exceptional : its state space is affinely isomorphic to the bloch ball by the standard parametrization @xmath72 in this case , every point of the boundary is also an extreme point . for higher",
    "@xmath0 , a smooth parametrization of the pure states does not define a boundary of a convex set .    for a composite system , restricting to a sub - system amounts to taking partial traces over remaining parties @xmath73 the entropy of a state with density matrix @xmath74",
    "is given by the von neumann entropy @xmath75 however , already the most basic property of the shannon entropy , monotonicity , does not carry over .",
    "consider for example the maximally entangled two - qubit state @xmath76 with @xmath77 .",
    "its entropy @xmath78 is zero as it is a pure state , while its restriction @xmath79 is the maximally mixed state , which has maximal entropy , so clearly @xmath80 .",
    "an important property that holds both for classical and quantum systems is that if the marginal @xmath79 of a bipartite state is pure then @xmath81 .",
    "this is an important ingredient of the theory : it namely allows to isolate a system from the rest of the universe . at the same time it is also a severe constraint on quantum systems because there are plenty of pure states of a composite system .",
    "in particular the restriction of an entangled pure state can never be pure and we can therefore not separate a party of an entangled system from the outside world , which is more or less what goes wrong with the locality assumption in the epr paradox .",
    "factorisation of extensions of pure states has also a bearing on joint extensions of states as considered in the previous section  @xcite . indeed , suppose that @xmath82 and @xmath83 are pure and agree on the middle system , which is easily feasible , then a joint extension @xmath84 can only exist for @xmath82 and @xmath83 pure product states .",
    "therefore a generic pure two - party state with inner shift - invariance as in  ( [ inv ] ) can not be extended .",
    "suppose that density matrices @xmath82 and @xmath85 agree on the middle system and can be jointly extended .",
    "the set of extensions is still convex and compact and so we can still look for the maximal entropy extension .",
    "finding this state is hard , however , because generally @xmath86 \\ne 0\\ ] ] or , equivalently , if @xmath82 and @xmath85 are equilibrium states corresponding to hamiltonians @xmath87 and @xmath88 @xmath89 moreover , the maximal entropy extension will not saturate the strong sub - additivity .",
    "actually , a nice characterisation of equality in strong sub - additivity for a state @xmath84 on a space @xmath90 in terms of decompositions of the middle space has been obtained in the paper by hayden et al .",
    "the necessary and sufficient condition is that the middle hilbert space @xmath91 decomposes as @xmath92 with @xmath93 convex weights .",
    "an example of the limitations imposed on quantum state extensions can be worked out for qubits with a su(2)-symmetry . in order to impose su(2)-symmetry on single qubit observables we use the adjoint representation of su(2 ) @xmath94 this is a reducible representation that decomposes into a spin 0 and a spin 1 irrep : @xmath95 the only su(2)-invariant state on @xmath96 is the uniform state @xmath97    for 2 qubits @xmath98 decomposes into 2 spin 0 , 3 spin 1 and 1 spin 2 irrep .",
    "there exists now a one - parameter family of su(2)-invariant states @xmath99 here @xmath100 is the projector on the singlet vector @xmath101 in @xmath102 .",
    "this projector commutes with every unitary of the form @xmath103 and every two - qubit observable that is su(2)-invariant is a linear combination of @xmath100 and @xmath104 .",
    "clearly , su(2)-invariant two - qubit states satisfy @xmath105 the two - qubit state @xmath74 is separable for @xmath106 and entangled for @xmath107 .",
    "hence the expectation value of this projector for a certain process tells us how much bipartite entanglement between two neighbouring spins is attainable .    for 3 qubits the su(2)-invariant states",
    "can still easily be determined but things become more complicated with increasing number of parties .",
    "let @xmath108 the algebra of three - qubit observables that are su(2)-invariant is not abelian .",
    "it can be decomposed into a direct sum of @xmath109 and @xmath96 where @xmath109 is identified with @xmath110 and @xmath96 with the algebra generated by @xmath111 and @xmath112 , not including @xmath104 .",
    "an su(2)-invariant three - qubit state is of the form @xmath113 with @xmath114 if we look for a su(2)-invariant three - party state with partial shift - invariance , then we find the following constraint on the expectation of @xmath100 @xmath115    su(2 ) and shift - invariant states on more parties will satisfy stronger upper bounds on the expectations of @xmath100 , see  ( [ p:3 ] ) . ultimately , if we look for a shift - invariant extension on the full half - chain then , using the bethe ansatz  @xcite , one can show that @xmath116    we may look for the largest expectation value of @xmath100 that can be obtained within classes of shift - invariant states that can easily be handled .",
    "consider as a first example point - wise limits of shift - invariant product states .",
    "such states are actually invariant under arbitrary finite permutations of sites on the half - chain and are usually called exchangeable . using the bloch parametrization  ( [ bloch ] ) and @xmath117 we have to maximize @xmath118\\ ] ] subject to the constraint @xmath119 .",
    "it is easily seen that the maximum is reached for @xmath120 for which value @xmath121 .",
    "hence @xmath122    the largest expectation for @xmath100 that can be reached within the class of product states is @xmath123 \\bigr)\\ ] ] subject to the constraint @xmath124 .",
    "the maximum @xmath125 is attained for @xmath126 where @xmath127 is an arbitrary vector of length 1 .",
    "therefore @xmath128 moreover , this maximum is attained for shift - invariant separable states that are equal weight mixtures of period-2 product states @xmath129 where @xmath130 is any orthonormal basis in @xmath131 .",
    "hence @xmath132 is an optimal upper bound .",
    "states of the form  ( [ neel ] ) are extreme shift - invariant states which allow a convex decomposition in clustering period-2 states .",
    "this is called nel order of period 2 . the value @xmath133 for shift - invariant separable states",
    "is still not close to the maximum value of @xmath134 .",
    "one can get closer by constructing more general quantum processes .",
    "we now turn to the construction of classical and quantum processes using as initial data a unity preserving cp map @xmath135 with invariant state @xmath74 . in the classical case",
    "this reduces to a stochastic matrix @xmath59 with invariant measure @xmath55 .",
    "the construction is based on finitely correlated states  @xcite , also called matrix product states",
    ". these are processes for which the correlations across any link can be modelled by a finite dimensional vector space .",
    "these states are more general than the ones we have considered until now and are easily constructible in the thermodynamic limit , unlike the bethe ansatz states .",
    "the finitely correlated states where e.g.  used in the lectures by j.  eisert under the form of tensor networks .",
    "actually pure states have been considered there as these lectures were focusing on ground states .",
    "we present here a different version that is adapted to mixed states .",
    "the starting point is a unity preserving completely positive ( upcp ) map @xmath136 that is compatible with the given @xmath4 in the following sense @xmath137 a process @xmath12 is now generated by repeatedly contracting the local observables on the half - chain . consider a sequence of upcp maps @xmath138 the expectation of a local observable @xmath139 is then computed as @xmath140    to define a stationary process , ( [ fcs ] ) must satisfy a number of requirements .",
    "the definition should be consistent in the first place , namely @xmath141 .",
    "this follows from the compatibility  ( [ comp ] ) and the invariance of @xmath74 : @xmath142 next , we need positivity .",
    "this follows immediately from the complete positivity of @xmath143 .",
    "the compatibility condition implies that @xmath143 maps the identity on @xmath144 to the identity on @xmath145 .",
    "this implies the normalization and stationarity of @xmath12 .",
    "it is important to observe that compatibility  ( [ comp ] ) imposes a severe restriction on @xmath4 .",
    "not every upcp transformation @xmath4 of @xmath69 admits a compatible extension .",
    "moreover , the compatible extensions of @xmath4 , whenever such extensions exist , form a compact and convex set and one may wonder about particular extensions .",
    "we now turn to some classes of examples .      a classical observable ,",
    "i.e. , a @xmath146-valued function @xmath147 on configuration space @xmath148 is naturally tabulated into a vector @xmath149 and identified with a diagonal matrix in @xmath69 through the map @xmath150 the relation between a ( completely ) positive transformation @xmath4 of @xmath69 and a stochastic @xmath58 matrix is then @xmath151 this allows to rewrite the compatibility equation  ( [ comp ] ) : a stochastic matrix @xmath152 is compatible with a stochastic matrix @xmath153 if @xmath154 let us introduce @xmath0 square matrices of dimension @xmath0 with non - negative entries @xmath155 the process generated by @xmath156 is then seen to be @xmath157 where @xmath158 has all its entries equal to one and @xmath55 is the invariant probability vector for @xmath59 .",
    "a stochastic matrix @xmath59 always allows the extension @xmath159 the corresponding process is the usual markov process  ( [ mar : pro2 ] ) .",
    "more general extensions @xmath12 are hidden markov processes : there exists a larger configuration space @xmath39 , a function @xmath160 and a markov process @xmath161 on @xmath39 such that @xmath162 the entropy of hidden markov processes can be computed using a method due to blackwell  @xcite .",
    "the starting point is the asymptotic entropy production formula  ( [ ent : pro ] ) .",
    "the construction of the process , adding one point at a time , see  ( [ fcs0 ] ) and ( [ fcs ] ) , defines a dynamical system on the length-@xmath0 probability vectors .",
    "the entropy of the process is then obtained as an average over entropies of probability vectors with respect to the invariant measure of the dynamical system .",
    "numerical evidence suggests that the markov extension has the smallest entropy amongst all .      in order to have manifest su(2)-invariance of the process we impose su(2)-covariance both on the cp transformation of @xmath96 and on its compatible extensions from @xmath163 to @xmath96 .",
    "let @xmath164 be a unitary representation of a group @xmath165 on a hilbert space @xmath166 .",
    "the adjoint representation lifts it to a representation of @xmath165 on the bounded linear transformations @xmath167 of @xmath166 : @xmath168 given two unitary representations @xmath169 and @xmath170 of @xmath165 on @xmath171 and @xmath91 a map @xmath172 is covariant if @xmath173    the choi - jamiokowski encoding of a linear map @xmath174 is very convenient for handling complete positivity @xmath175 @xmath4 is completely positive if and only if @xmath176 is positive semi - definite .",
    "the encoding depends on the chosen basis through the matrix units @xmath177 but only up to unitary equivalence as @xmath178 the covariance condition  ( [ cov ] ) for @xmath174 translates for its choi - jamiokowski encoding into @xmath179 = 0,\\enskip g \\in { \\mathcal{g}}.\\ ] ] here @xmath180 is the complex conjugate of the matrix @xmath3 . for su(2 ) there is an additional simplification because the conjugate of su(2 ) is unitarily equivalent to su(2 ) .",
    "it turns out that there is a one - parameter family of su(2)-covariant upcp transformations of @xmath96 @xmath181 the su(2)-covariant upcp maps @xmath182 compatible with @xmath4 are parametrized by three real parameters @xmath183 complete positivity imposes constraints on @xmath184 , @xmath185 , and @xmath186 @xmath187 these conditions can be obtained by imposing positivity on the choi matrix of @xmath143 .",
    "the allowed region is a piece of a cone in @xmath188 .",
    "we then compute the expectation of @xmath100 @xmath189 the maximum in the allowed parameter region is attained for @xmath190 and @xmath191 and is independent of @xmath186 .",
    "therefore @xmath192 for @xmath193 a stationary and su(2)-invariant process as in  ( [ fcs0 ] ) .",
    "this should be compared with  ( [ exc ] ) .    in passing from exchangeable to shift - invariant separable states",
    "we actually allowed product states of period 2 .",
    "this can also be applied to processes of the type  ( [ cp : qubit ] ) . considering @xmath194 as the contribution to the energy of two neighbouring spins , a minimal value of @xmath195 corresponds to a maximal value of @xmath196 and this",
    "is expected to happen for spins as anti - parallel as possible .",
    "therefore the second requirement in  ( [ cp : qubit ] ) is inappropriate and we should consider general su(2)-covariant maps @xmath182 .",
    "these are determined by four real parameters @xmath197 complete positivity imposes the constraints @xmath198 we now introduce two su(2)-covariant maps @xmath199 as in  ( [ cp2:qubit ] ) with defining parameters @xmath200 .",
    "the expectation of @xmath100 in the equal weight average of these period-2 processes is given by @xmath201 maximizing this in the allowed parameter region yields @xmath202 which is within 10% of the optimal bound and well within the entangled shift - invariant states .",
    "an interesting and physically relevant class of channels are the davies maps , they arise in the reduced dynamical description of a system with a discrete level structure weakly coupled to a thermal bath  @xcite .",
    "the level structure of the small system is preserved in the sense that such a map @xmath4 is parametrized by a stochastic map @xmath59 and a decoherence matrix @xmath203 .",
    "the matrix @xmath59 describes the stochastic evolution of the diagonal elements while @xmath203 gives the damping of the off - diagonal terms .",
    "assuming that the system hamiltonian is diagonal in the canonical basis @xmath204 here , @xmath205 .",
    "moreover , @xmath59 is detailed balance and @xmath203 is real symmetric .",
    "detailed balance means that @xmath59 is hermitian for the stationary measure @xmath55 that is interpreted as the gibbs state of the system @xmath206 this condition is equivalent with micro - reversibility : the occupation rate of level @xmath207 times the jump probability from @xmath207 to @xmath208 is equal to the occupation rate of @xmath208 times the jump probability from @xmath208 to @xmath207 .",
    "another equivalent condition is @xmath209    complete positivity additionally imposes that @xmath210 the action of @xmath4 is quite clear : decay of the off - diagonal elements and birth and death process for the diagonals .",
    "the relations between the different rates are encoded in the positivity condition  ( [ davies : cp ] ) .",
    "e.g. , one can readily check that the decay rate of the off - diagonals can not be less than half the rate of convergence to equilibrium for the diagonal process .    for davies maps one could expect the standard basis vectors to be minimizers of output entropy but",
    "this is not generally true .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that already for a single qubit a true superposition of ground and excited state is the minimizer in a regime where the map is close to the identity map and so truly quantum .",
    "high powers of a davies map converge to the projector on the equilibrium state which is entanglement breaking . in this regime",
    "the minimizer for output entropy is the state corresponding to the row of minimal entropy in @xmath59 .",
    "the construction of a process as in  ( [ fcs0 ] ) requires a davies map rather closer to the projector on the equilibrium state than to the identity . for a single qubit @xmath211 and with @xmath0 the damping factor of the off - diagonal element one checks that it generates a process if @xmath212      for both bosons and fermions there exists a notion of gaussian states and maps  @xcite that are considerably simpler to handle than general ones .",
    "the names free , quasi - free , quadratic , linear , and determinantal are also used .",
    "moreover , these states and maps are good approximations whenever the statistics dominates over the interactions .",
    "a considerable benefit is also the scaling behaviour : the dimension of the free objects grows linearly in the number of particles instead of exponentially .",
    "we shall here only describe the defining free objects without connecting them to the true observables , states , and maps of a many particle system .",
    "this yields a kind of meta - description .",
    "moreover , we restrict ourselves to fermions .    the observables of fermions with mode space @xmath166 are the trace - class operators @xmath213 on @xmath166 .",
    "apart from their linear structure commutators are also useful .",
    "the mode space @xmath214 of a bipartite system is just the direct sum of the mode spaces @xmath171 and @xmath91 of the corresponding subsystems and observables of system 1 are extended by putting @xmath215    the symbols play the role of states , they are operators @xmath216 on @xmath166 such that @xmath217 . the expectation of an observable @xmath3 is just @xmath218 .",
    "mixtures of symbols are constrained by the following requirement : let @xmath219 then the mixture of @xmath220 with weights @xmath221 and @xmath222 can be formed if and only if @xmath223 is of rank 1 and it yields the symbol @xmath224 .",
    "it then follows that a symbol is pure if and only if it is an orthogonal projector , possibly 0 .",
    "given a composite system @xmath225 and two symbols @xmath226 and @xmath227 , the product state has symbol @xmath228 . in this context",
    ", a separable state is just block diagonal in the mode space decomposition .",
    "we shall also need the von  neumann entropy of a symbol on a finite dimensional space @xmath229 .",

    "a trace - preserving completely positive map from @xmath231 is a couple @xmath232 of linear maps where @xmath233 the action on a symbol is given by @xmath234 observe that such maps are compatible with the notion of convex mixture of above because there is only a single kraus - like operator appearing in  ( [ qf : cp ] ) .",
    "composition of free cp maps is given by a semi - direct product @xmath235    we now mimic within the fermionic free context the construction of a process starting from a cp transformation @xmath232 of @xmath145 .",

    "explicitly @xmath244    the entropy",
    "can now be computed in two different ways , we can either compute the limiting average entropy as in  ( [ av : ent ] ) or the asymptotic entropy production as in  ( [ ent : pro ] ) .",
    "the first method relies on an extension of szeg s theorem to block toeplitz matrices . for the second we need either a much finer control on the spectra of principal sub - matrices of a block toeplitz matrix , which appears to be hard , or we have to exploit the smoothness of the entropy function .",
    "we follow this last approach .",
