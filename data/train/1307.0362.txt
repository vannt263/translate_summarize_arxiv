    "a basic quark model indicates that baryons consist of three quarks ( @xmath11 ) and mesons of a quark - antiquark pair ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the family of the baryons and mesons is called hadrons , and a few hundred hadrons have been found experimentally @xcite .",
    "however , an undoubted evidence has not been found for an exotic hadron , which has a different configuration from @xmath11 and @xmath12 , although the fundamental theory of strong interaction , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , does not prohibit the existence of such states like tetra - quark ( @xmath13 ) and penta - quark ( @xmath14 ) hadrons @xcite .",
    "it is , nevertheless , fortunate that the experimental situation changed in the last several years because there have been reports on exotic hadron candidates particularly from the belle and babar collaborations @xcite .",
    "exotic hadrons were suggested in experimental measurements so far by looking at masses , spins , and decay widths , namely global observables at low energies .",
    "for example , electromagnetic and strong decay widths could provide useful information on exotic hadrons @xcite .",
    "however , at low energies , effective degrees of freedom are hadrons and only integrated quantities are observed , so that it is not easy to judge whether or not a hadron has an exotic quark - gluon configuration . therefore , it is appropriate to look for high - energy processes , where quark - gluon degrees of freedom appear explicitly .",
    "keeping this idea in mind , we have been investigating possible high - energy processes for determining internal structure of exotic hadron candidates , for example , by fragmentation functions @xcite and hadron - production processes in the @xmath15 annihilation @xcite .    in this article , we propose that the constituent - counting rule of perturbative qcd could be used for finding the internal quark configuration of exotic - hadron candidates in exclusive production processes . in the exclusive process @xmath16 with large - momentum transfer",
    ", hard gluon exchange processes should occur to maintain the exclusive nature .",
    "namely , quarks should share large momenta so that they should stick together to become a hadron by exchanging hard gluons .",
    "then , considering hard quark and gluon propagators in the reaction , we obtain that the cross section of the @xmath16 exclusive reaction should scale like @xmath17 with @xmath18 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are mandelstam variables , @xmath19 is the scattering angle in the center - of - mass ( c.m . ) system , and @xmath20 is the number of constituents in the particle @xmath21 .",
    "this asymptotic scaling relation is known as the constituent - counting rule @xcite .",

    "one of remarkable properties for @xmath4 is its anomalously light mass .",
    "namely , in the ground states which possess spin - parity @xmath24 , @xmath2 is heavier than the nucleon , @xmath25 mev , due to the heavier strange quark in @xmath2 .",
    "however , in the @xmath26 states , the lowest excitation states of @xmath2 and nucleon are @xmath4 and @xmath27 , respectively , and the puzzling reversal of the mass relation takes place as @xmath28 mev , although @xmath4 should have the heavier strange quark .",
    "the mass of @xmath4 is found to be anomalously light also compared to the result of the su(6 ) quark model , in which both @xmath4 and @xmath27 should be considered to be baryons in the 70-dimensional representation with @xmath29-wave excitation of a quark @xcite but it is difficult to explain the lighter mass of @xmath4 than @xmath27 in the same representation .",
    "therefore , it has been thought as an exotic hadron , beyond the naive three - quark ( @xmath30 ) configuration .    instead of an @xmath30 three - quark system ,",
    "the @xmath4 has been considered as a @xmath31 molecule for a long time @xcite because it is slightly below the @xmath31 threshold and the @xmath32 interaction is strongly attractive in the isospin 0 channel .",

    "it is difficult to find a clear experimental evidence for the molecular or any other exotic configuration because global quantities such as masses and decay widths have been used . on the other hand ,",
    "the quark - gluon degrees of freedom appear in high - energy reactions .",
    "for example , scaling behavior of exclusive cross sections is known as the constituent - counting rule .",

    "fortunately , the high - momentum beamline of the j - parc will be built in a few years and unseparated hadron ( essentially pion ) beam with momentum up to 15 - 20 gev will be available . then , the exclusive reaction @xmath0 will become experimentally possible in principle .",

    "<S> we propose to use hard exclusive production of an exotic hadron for finding its internal quark - gluon configuration by the constituent - counting rule in perturbative qcd . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the cross section for the exclusive process @xmath0 is estimated at the scattering angle @xmath1 in the center - of - mass frame by using current experimental data . in comparison , the cross section for the ground - state @xmath2 production @xmath3 is also shown . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the internal quark configuration of @xmath4 should be determined by the asymptotic scaling behavior of the cross section . if it is an ordinary three - quark baryon , the scaling of the cross section is @xmath5constant , whereas it is @xmath6constant if @xmath4 is a five - quark hadron , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are mandelstam variables . </S>",
    "<S> such a measurement will be possible , for example , by using the high - momentum beamline at j - parc . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , another exclusive process @xmath9 could be investigated at leps and jlab for finding the nature of @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> we indicate that the constituent - counting rule could be used as a valuable quantity in determining internal structure of exotic hadrons by high - energy exclusive processes , where quark - gluon degrees of freedom explicitly appear . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it is interesting to investigate the transition from hadron degrees of freedom to quark - gluon ones for exclusive exotic - hadron production processes . </S>"
