    "the steady water - wave problem concerns two - dimensional water waves propagating with constant velocity and without change of shape .",
    "historically , the focus has mainly been on irrotational waves , which are waves where the vorticity @xmath0 of the velocity field @xmath1 is identically zero .",
    "one reason for this is kelvin s circulation theorem @xcite , which says that a flow which is initially irrotational will remain so for all time , as long as it is only affected by conservative body forces ( e.g. gravity ) .",
    "another reason is mathematical , as the velocity field can then be written as the gradient of a harmonic function ; the velocity potential .",
    "this enables the use of powerful tools from complex- and harmonic analysis , and the problem can be reduced to one on the boundary in a number of different ways @xcite .",
    "an important class of such waves are the stokes waves , which are periodic waves that rise and fall exactly once every minimal period .",
    "the stokes conjecture on the nature of the so - called stokes wave of greatest height fueled research on waves throughout the 20th century , and would not be fully resolved until 2004 ( see the survey @xcite and @xcite , which settled the convexity of this wave ) .",
    "more recently , however , there has been renewed interest in rotational waves .",
    "there are several situations where such waves are appropriate , as effects like wind , temperature or salinity gradients can all induce rotation @xcite .",
    "rotational waves can be markedly different from irrotational waves : for instance , in rotational waves it is possible to have internal stagnation points and critical layers of closed streamlines known as cat s eye vortices @xcite .",
    "the first result on rotational waves came surprisingly early , in the beginning of the 1800s with @xcite ( for a more modern exposition , see @xcite ) .",
    "there , gerstner gave the first , and still the only known , explicit ( nontrivial ) gravity - wave solution to the euler equations on infinite depth .",
    "although significant because it is an exact solution , it is viewed as more of a mathematical curiosity , even today ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  4.3 ) ) . much later , in @xcite , came the first existence result for small - amplitude waves with quite general vorticity distributions .",
    "a vorticity distribution is a function @xmath2 such that @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the relative stream function ( which , unlike the velocity potential , is still available for rotational waves , but is not harmonic ) .",
    "a sufficient , but not necessary , condition for such a vorticity distribution to exist is that the wave has no stagnation points .",
    "several improvements have been made to the existence result of dubreil - jacotin , but it was not until the pioneering article @xcite that large waves were constructed , using global bifurcation theory .",
    "this article sparked mathematical research into rotational waves .",
    "the use of a semi - hodograph transform in @xcite and @xcite , and the corresponding deep - water result in @xcite , means that the resulting waves can not exhibit critical layers .",
    "since then , small - amplitude waves with constant vorticity and a critical layer have been constructed in @xcite , and later in @xcite with a different approach that allows for waves with overhanging surface profiles ( there is numerical evidence for the existence of such waves , e.g. @xcite , but this is still an open problem ) .",
    "a reasonable next step is that of waves with an affine vorticity distribution , whose existence was shown in @xcite .",
    "spurred by the above results there has also been interest in studying the properties and dynamics of these waves below the surface @xcite .",
    "this had been done for linear waves in @xcite .",
    "several other avenues have also been considered : we mention heterogeneous waves both with @xcite and without @xcite surface tension , waves with discontinuous vorticity @xcite , a variational approach @xcite and hamiltonian formulation with center manifold reduction @xcite .",
    "existence of large amplitude waves with constant vorticity and a critical layer was established in @xcite , in the presence of capillary effects .",
    "there is also a forthcoming result for pure gravity waves @xcite , using an entirely different approach .",
    "common for all the previously mentioned works on rotational waves is the feature that the vorticity is supported on the entire fluid domain ( due to the assumption of the existence of a vorticity distribution ) .",
    "recently , gravity - capillary waves with compactly supported vorticity were constructed in @xcite , on infinite depth .",
    "this includes small- and large - amplitude periodic waves with a point vortex , and small - amplitude solitary waves with either a point vortex or vortex patch . by a point vortex",
    "we mean that the vorticity is given by a @xmath5-function , while we use vortex patch to mean that the vorticity is locally integrable and compactly supported .",
    "the waves with a point vortex are the simplest form of waves with compactly supported vorticity , and are in a sense `` almost irrotational '' .    in this paper , which is based on @xcite ,",
    "we extend the existence result for solitary small - amplitude waves with a point vortex to finite depth , and also give both qualitative and quantitative properties for these waves .",
    "the main approach to showing existence follows that of @xcite , but we also treat the natural generalization of waves with several point vortices along a vertical line , and show existence for all but exceptional configurations of vortices . finally , by finding an explicit expression for the rotational part of the stream function , we give some explicit expressions for the small - amplitude periodic waves with a point vortex on infinite depth that were constructed in @xcite .",
    "an outline of the paper is as follows : in we formulate the problem , and in we give the functional - analytic setting for this formulation .",
    "then , in we prove existence of small solutions , and give some properties for these . treats the extension to several point vortices .",
    "the final section , , contains the explicit expressions for periodic waves on infinite depth .",
    "under the assumption of inviscid ( absence of viscosity ) and incompressible ( constant fluid density ) flow , the governing equations of motion are the so - called incompressible euler equations . for describing water waves on the open sea ,",
    "these are realistic assumptions @xcite , and standard .",
    "we will further assume two - dimensional flow under the influence of gravity , where the cartesian coordinates @xmath6 describe the horizontal and vertical direction , respectively .",
    "then the equations read @xmath7 where @xmath1 is the velocity of the fluid , @xmath8 is the pressure distribution and @xmath9 is the constant gravitational acceleration is approximately @xmath10 , varying by less than @xmath11 on the earth s suface ( see @xcite ) . ] .    for convenience",
    "we place , at time @xmath12 , the flat bottom at @xmath13 and the surface at @xmath14 where @xmath15 describes the deviation of the free boundary .",
    "we assume that @xmath16 is bounded , continuous and strictly bounded below by @xmath17 .",
    "it should be emphasized that , due to the free boundary assumption , the function @xmath15 is a priori unknown ; determining it is part of the problem .",
    "in addition to , we require boundary conditions to match our domain . in order to model the bottom being impermeable",
    ", we will demand that @xmath18 where @xmath19 describes the surface tension and @xmath20 is the nonlinear differential operator @xmath21 yielding the curvature of the surface .",
    "the symbol @xmath22 denotes the japanese bracket defined through @xmath23 .",
    "is known to physicists as the young  laplace equation , and states that the pressure difference across a fluid interface ( in this case water / air ) is proportional to its curvature .",
    "note that in the lower limit @xmath24 , the dynamic boundary condition in corresponds to the assumption of constant pressure on the surface , but we will require that @xmath25 be strictly positive .",
    "the proof of , for example , relies upon the assumption that @xmath26 .      by taking the curl of",
    ", one obtains after some simple calculations that @xmath27 which states that the vorticity @xmath28 is transported by the vector field @xmath29 . due to this , it is natural to expect that if the vorticity consists of a point vortex at some time , then it will remain a point vortex at all future times , and be transported with the flow .",
    "it should be emphasized that , for now , this is not justified by ; the multiplication of @xmath28 with @xmath29 is not well defined , as @xmath29 will not be smooth at the point vortex .",
    "thus , we will have need of a weaker form of the equation .",
    "we remind the reader of the fundamental solution of the poisson equation .    [",
    "prop : delta_vorticity ] the distribution @xmath30 defined by @xmath31 satisfies @xmath32 and @xmath33    if @xmath28 is of the form @xmath34 then we deduce from that @xmath29 is of the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 satisfies @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and is therefore smooth in space ( see the discussion before ) . as the first term , which we may think of as",
    "the part of @xmath29 generated by the point vortex , is singular , divergence free and odd around @xmath39 , it is not unreasonable to think that the dynamics of the point vortex should depend only on @xmath36 . in other words , that the path @xmath40 along which the point vortex moves should satisfy @xmath41    this can indeed be made rigorous . in (",
    "* theorems 4.1 and 4.2 ) it is proved that if one considers initial data consisting of a vortex patch converging in the sense of distributions to a point vortex , then the weak solutions of the vorticity transport equation converge to a moving point vortex in an appropriate sense .",
    "moreover , the position of this point vortex satisfies .",
    "thus , we will allow for point vortices , as long as they are propagated in the fluid as in .",
    "we now assume that there are functions @xmath42 , depending only on space , and a constant velocity @xmath43 such that @xmath44 for all relevant @xmath45 and @xmath12 .",
    "positive and negative @xmath46 then correspond to waves moving in the positive and negative @xmath47-directions , respectively . in the new _ steady _ variables",
    "@xmath48 , after dropping the tildes , our equations read @xmath49 with boundary conditions @xmath50 on the now time - independent domain @xmath51 we call the problem of finding @xmath52 and @xmath15 such that these equations are satisfied the _ steady water - wave problem_. note also that the vorticity equation given in reduces to @xmath53 for a point vortex centered at @xmath54 .",
    "it turns out that it is possible to reduce the water - wave problem to an entirely one - dimensional one on the surface in a clever way .",
    "this is known as the zakharov ",
    "sulem formulation , and was first introduced by zakharov in @xcite , and then later put on a firmer mathematical basis in @xcite .",
    "the original formulation relies on the fluid being irrotational , but it is in fact sufficient that this holds near the surface .",
    "this is where the compact support of the vorticity comes in .",
    "suppose that we have solved the steady water wave problem for some @xmath55 .",
    "it is then convenient to split the velocity @xmath29 as @xmath56 where @xmath36 is irrotational , that is , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "we also assume that both @xmath36 and @xmath59 are divergence free . for us , @xmath59 will be known .",
    "although we will allow for @xmath28 to be a singular distribution , the vector field @xmath60 will be assumed to at least be in the sobolev space @xmath61 , and @xmath62 to be at least @xmath63 . by the assumption of @xmath64 , the differentials @xmath65 on @xmath66",
    "are closed .",
    "hence , as @xmath66 is simply connected , these differentials are exact by generalizations of the poincar lemma ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorems 2.1 and 3.1 ) .",
    "thus , there are stream functions @xmath67 ( by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 2.1 ) ) , determined uniquely modulo constants by @xmath36 and @xmath59 , such that @xmath68 moreover , by the assumed curl of these vector fields , the function @xmath69 is harmonic , and @xmath70 satisfies @xmath71 .",
    "in particular , @xmath69 is smooth , and so is @xmath59 outside the support of @xmath28 .    by the above",
    ", we thus have that @xmath72 holds for the velocity field @xmath29 .",
    "suppose now that @xmath59 and @xmath70 are chosen such that @xmath73 at the bottom .",
    "then the boundary condition in translates to @xmath69 being constant along the bottom .",
    "since @xmath69 is unique modulo constants , we may as well take this condition to be @xmath74 instead .",
    "we will now apply the assumption that @xmath75 is compact .",
    "this means that a velocity potential for @xmath29 exists on any simply connected domain not containing @xmath76 .",
    "can then in turn be used to show that @xmath77 holds on any such domain .",
    "hence , in particular , we obtain the surface bernoulli equation @xmath78 where @xmath79 is a real constant . here",
    "we have inserted the boundary condition for the pressure at the surface , .",
