    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) are one of the most luminous explosive events of stars .",
    "recently , sne ia have been used as good distance indicators that provide a promising tool for determining cosmological parameters @xcite because of their almost uniform maximum luminosities .",
    "these both groups derive the maximum luminosities , @xmath18 , of sne ia completely empirically from the light curve shape ( lcs ) of nearby sne ia , and assume that the same @xmath18-lcs relation holds in high red - shift ( @xmath19 ) sne ia . in order that this method works , the nature of sne ia and their progenitors should be the same between high-@xmath19 and low-@xmath19 sne ia .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to identify the progenitor binary systems , thus confirming whether or not sne ia `` evolve '' from high red - shift to low red - shift galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is widely accepted that the exploding star itself is an accreting white dwarf ( wd ) in a binary ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the companion star ( and thus the observed binary system ) is not known .",
    "several types of objects have ever been considered , which include merging double white dwarfs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , recurrent novae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , symbiotic stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) etc .",
    "one of the candidates , the recurrent nova u scorpii underwent sixth recorded outburst in february 25 , 1999 @xcite . for the first time , a complete light curve of the outburst has been obtained from the rising phase to the final decline phase through the mid - plateau phase including eclipses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by analyzing these new data on a basis of the theoretical light - curve model of outbursts",
    ", @xcite have elucidated the outburst nature of u sco much more accurately than the previous estimates ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we summarize some critically important values they have obtained .",
    "( 1 ) the white dwarf mass in u sco is @xmath20 .",
    "( 2 ) the companion is a slightly evolved main - sequence star of 1.41.6 @xmath21 that expands to fill the roche lobe after a large part of the central hydrogen has been consumed and is now transferring mass to the white dwarf in a thermally unstable manner .",
    "( 3 ) the white dwarf is now growing in mass at an average rate of @xmath22 yr@xmath10 .",
    "therefore , the white dwarf will reach the critical mass ( @xmath23 , in w7 model of @xcite ) for the sn ia explosion in the quite near future .",
    "they concluded that u sco is a very strong candidate for the immediate progenitor of sne ia .",
    "other recurrent novae are also expected to be a strong candidate for sne ia .",
    "thus , we have started our light curve analysis of recurrent novae in which the mass and the growth rate of white dwarfs are determined as accurately as possible and examine the possibility of an sn ia explosion in the quite near future . in this series of papers , details of our results on recurrent novae",
    "are presented , although a part of our results has already been published in several short papers ( @xcite for t crb ; @xcite for u sco ; @xcite for rs oph ; @xcite for v394 cra ) .    here , in the first paper of this series",
    ", we have examined four recurrent novae which have a red giant companion , t crb , rs oph , v745 sco , v3890 sgr .",
    "two of them ( t crb and rs oph ) are reexamined with new observational knowledge .",
    "we first summarize the nature of recurrent novae and explain the physical reason why they become so massive as near the chandrasekhar mass limit in  2 .",
    "then , we show details of our numerical methods for calculating evolution of bloated white dwarf envelopes in  3 and for obtaining theoretical light curves in  4 , because details of our numerical method have not been fully described yet .",
    "new numerical results on determination of white dwarf masses for four recurrent novae are shown and discussed in  5 for t crb , in  6 for rs oph , in  7 for v745 sco , and in  8 for v3890 sgr .",
    "conclusions follow in  9 .",
    "recurrent novae are characterized by nova eruptions with its recurrence time scale from a decade to a century , its brightness amplitude larger than 6 magnitudes , and its expansion velocity faster than 300 km s@xmath10 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "they are considered to be binary systems in which the secondary companion star overflows the inner critical roche lobe and transfers matter onto the primary white dwarf ( wd ) component . when the hydrogen - rich envelope on the wd reaches a critical mass , hydrogen ignites to trigger a nova eruption ( hydrogen shell - flash ) .",
    "we call this a _ thermonuclear runaway ( tnr ) event_.    recurrent novae are morphologically divided into three groups depending on its companion star : dwarf companions , only one member , t pyxidis with @xmath24 days , @xcite ; slightly evolved main - sequence ( ms ) companions , u scorpii with @xmath25 days @xcite , v394 coronae austrinae with @xmath26 days @xcite , large magellanic cloud nova 1990 no.2 , hereafter lmc rn , with @xmath27unknown but @xmath28 days was suggested @xcite , ci aquilae with @xmath29 days @xcite , and red giant ( rg ) companions , t coronae borealis with @xmath30 days @xcite , rs ophiuchi with @xmath31 days , @xcite , recently revised to be @xmath32 days @xcite , v745 scorpii with @xmath27unknown , v3890 sagittarii with @xmath27unknown , where @xmath33 is the orbital period of the binary in units of day .",
    "these are sometimes called t pyx subclass , u sco subclass , and t crb ( or rs oph ) subclass , respectively ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we have summarized these features in table [ recurrent_novae ] .",
    "classical novae , sharing many aspects with the recurrent novae , are also binary systems consisting of a white dwarf and a less massive main - sequence star that fills the roche lobe and transfers its mass to the white dwarf .",
    "the white dwarf accumulates hydrogen - rich matter and ignites hydrogen atop the white dwarf when the hydrogen - rich envelope on the white dwarf reaches a critical mass .",
    "a part of the hydrogen diffuses into the white dwarf before the ignition so that a very surface layer of the white dwarf is dredged up into the hydrogen - rich envelope and blown off in the outburst wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as a result , nova ejecta contain white dwarf matter , i.e. , carbon and oxygen for carbon - oxygen white dwarfs or oxygen , neon , and magnesium for o - ne - mg white dwarfs ( see , e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "thus , the white dwarf is eroded gradually after many cycles of nova outbursts , recurrence periods of which are usually longer than thousands of years .",
    "recurrent novae show some characteristic differences : ( 1 ) heavy elements such as carbon , oxygen and neon are not enriched in ejecta but similar to the solar values ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for summary ) , indicating that the white dwarf is not eroded ; ( 2 ) very short recurrence periods from a decade to a century theoretically require very massive white dwarfs close to the chandrasekhar mass limit ( e.g. , fig",
    ". 9 of * ? ? ?",
    "these two arguments indicate that the mass of the white dwarfs in recurrent novae increases toward the chandrasekhar mass limit ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we expect that , if the white dwarf is made of carbon and oxygen , the white dwarf ignites carbon at the center and explodes as a type ia supernova when it reaches the critical mass of @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "however , the evolutionary path to recurrent novae has not long been elucidated as well as the reason why so massive white dwarfs can exist in recurrent novae .      in this subsection ,",
    "we briefly explain how white dwarfs in recurrent novae have grown its mass toward the chandrasekhar mass limit .",
    "the reason why the standard binary evolution theory ( will be cited below ) has failed to explain the evolutionary path to recurrent novae is mainly in the theoretical prediction of a common envelope formation and the ensuing spiral - in process , because these processes inhibit the growth of white dwarfs in binary systems .",
    "as discussed in many previous papers on binary evolutions , it had been widely accepted that hydrogen - rich envelopes on mass - accreting white dwarfs expand to a red giant size when its mass accretion rate , @xmath35 , exceeds a critical limit , @xmath36 , i.e. , @xmath37 yr@xmath10 ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "9 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and easily forms a common envelope ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "once a common envelope is formed , two stars begin to spiral - in each other due to viscous drag ; thus , producing a double degenerate system ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , @xcite found that white dwarfs begin to blow strong winds ( @xmath38 km s@xmath10 and @xmath39 yr@xmath10 ) when the mass accretion rate exceeds the critical rate , i.e. , @xmath40 , as illustrated in figure [ accwind ] ; thus , preventing the binary from collapsing .",
    "the binary does not spiral - in but keeps its separation .",
    "hydrogen burns steadily and therefore the helium layer of the white dwarf can grow at a rate of @xmath41 .",
    "the other transferred matter is blown in the wind ( @xmath42 ) , where @xmath43 is the wind mass loss rate .",
    "we call this _ accretion wind _ because it begins to blow when the accretion rate exceeds the critical rate",
    ".    therefore , as shown in figure [ accmap_z02 ] , we have to revise figure 9 of @xcite , which has been widely used in binary evolution scenarios as basic processes of mass - accreting white dwarfs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the most important difference of figure [ accmap_z02 ] from old nomoto s ( 1982 ) is that white dwarfs grow its mass in a much wider parameter region . in our new diagram ,",
    "the status of a mass - accreting white dwarf is specified by the following three phases : ( 1 ) accretion wind phase ( @xmath40 ) ; ( 2 ) steady shell - burning phase ( @xmath44 ) ; and ( 3 ) intermittent shell - flash phase ( @xmath45 ) , where @xmath46 means the lowest limit of mass accretion rate for steady hydrogen shell burning .",
    "the new growing region of white dwarfs , @xmath47 , is much wider than old nomoto s ( 1982 ) narrow strip , @xmath44 .",
    "based on the new mechanism of figures [ accwind ] and [ accmap_z02 ] , @xcite have found two paths to sne ia ( see also , * ? ? ?",
    "in these two paths , white dwarfs can accrete mass continuously from the companion and grow at a rate of @xmath48 yr@xmath10 .",
    "therefore , candidates of sn ia progenitors are systems at the final stages on these paths ; i.e. , one is a supersoft x - ray source ( sss ) consisting of a white dwarf and a lobe - filling more massive main - sequence star ( wd+ms system , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and the other is a symbiotic star consisting of a white dwarf and a mass - losing red giant ( wd+rg system , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "both the systems contribute to main parts of the sn ia birth rate @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent review ) .",
    "@xcite have followed many evolutionary paths and obtained the initial parameter regions of binaries that finally produce an sn ia .",
    "figure [ zregevl10 ] shows such two regions of the wd+ms systems ( sss channel ) and the wd+rg systems ( symbiotic channel ) .",
    "we have added in this figure the final parameter regions just before an sn ia explosion occurs .",
    "starting from the initial region encircled by the thin solid lines , binary systems evolve and can explode as an sn ia in the regions enclosed by the thick solid lines .",
    "@xcite showed that some recurrent novae lie on the boarder of their parameter region that can produce an sn ia . among six recurrent novae with known orbital periods , five fall in the final regions of sn ia progenitors just before the explosion .",
    "only t pyx is far out of the regions of sne ia .",
    "in the thermonuclear runaway ( tnr ) model of nova explosions , wd envelopes expand greatly as large as @xmath49 or more and then the photospheric radius gradually shrinks to the original size of the white dwarfs ( e.g. , @xmath50 for @xmath51 ) . here , we call this _ decay phase _ , i.e. , the phase after the maximum expansion of the photosphere . in the decay phase of novae , the photospheric temperature increases from @xmath52 k to @xmath53 k with the bolometric luminosity being almost constant ( near the eddington limit ) . therefore , the main emitting region moves from optical to soft x - ray through uv .",
    "correspondingly , the optical luminosity reaches its maximum at the maximum expansion of the photosphere and then decays toward the level in quiescent phase . since the wd envelope reaches a steady - state in the decay phase of novae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we are able to approximate the development of the envelope structure with a unique sequence of steady - state wind solutions having a different envelope mass ( @xmath54 ) as shown by kato & hachisu ( 1994 ) .",
    "optically thick winds , blowing from wds in the decay phase of novae , play a key role in determining the nova duration , because the winds eject a large part of the envelope mass and drastically reduce the fuel .",
    "the winds blow when the wd photosphere is larger than @xmath55 , i.e. , when the photospheric temperature is lower than @xmath56 , because the wind is driven by a strong peak at @xmath57 in opal opacity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and @xmath58 corresponds to the shoulder of the peak on the high temperature side .",
    "this opacity peak strongly blocks photons and , as a reaction , matter is effectively accelerated to blow a wind deep inside the photosphere ( see , e.g. , figs . 2 , 3 , and 4 in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "assuming the solar abundance of heavy elements ( @xmath2 ) , we have calculated the steady - state envelope solutions and obtained sequences for wds with various masses of @xmath59 , 0.7 , 0.8 , 0.9 , 1.0 , 1.1 , 1.2 , 1.3 , 1.34 , 1.35 , 1.36 , 1.37 , and @xmath60 . here , we have adopted the updated opal opacity @xcite with lower hydrogen contents of @xmath61 , 0.50 , 0.35 , 0.15 , 0.10 , 0.08 , 0.07 , 0.06 , 0.05 , and 0.04 .",
    "the numerical methods and various assumptions are essentially the same as those in kato & hachisu ( 1994 ) except the opacities .",
    "some of them are plotted in figure [ dmdtallsol ] .    for rs oph and lmc rn ,",
    "we have also obtained the envelope solutions for lower metallicities , i.e. , @xmath62 , 0.002 , 0.004 , and 0.01 with @xmath61 , 0.50 , 0.35 , 0.15 , 0.10 , 0.08 , 0.07 , 0.06 , 0.05 , and 0.04 .",
    "some of them are also shown in figure [ dmdtall_low_m ] .",
    "hydrogen shell - flashes occur when the mass transfer rate is below the lowest limit for the steady hydrogen shell - burning , i.e. , @xmath45 . in this subsection",
    ", we describe such a rapid development of white dwarf envelopes .",
    "as already mentioned above , optically thick winds blow in the decay phase of hydrogen shell - flashes .",
    "since each wind solution is a unique function of the envelope mass @xmath54 for a given wd mass , we can follow the development of the envelope structure by calculating the envelope mass , which is decreasing due to the wind mass loss at a rate of @xmath63 and hydrogen shell burning at a rate of @xmath64 , i.e. , @xmath65 where @xmath35 is the mass accretion rate of the wd . directly integrating equation ( [ dmdt_envelope_mass ] )",
    ", we obtain the time - development of the envelope , @xmath54 , and then the evolutionary changes of physical quantities such as the photospheric temperature @xmath66 , photospheric radius @xmath67 , photospheric velocity @xmath68 , wind mass loss rate @xmath63 , and nuclear burning rate @xmath64 , all of which are a unique function of the envelope mass , @xmath54 .",
    "we have shown , in figures [ dmdtallsol ] and [ dmdtall_low_m ] , the envelope mass @xmath54 , the photospheric radius @xmath69 , the photospheric temperature @xmath70 , and the photospheric velocity @xmath71 against the mass decreasing rate of the envelope , @xmath72 .",
    "the wind mass loss rate becomes as large as @xmath73@xmath74 yr@xmath10 at the maximum expansion of the photosphere @xmath75 , and then decreases down to @xmath76 yr@xmath10 just before the wind stops , i.e. , when @xmath77 .",
    "the photospheric temperature increases from @xmath78 k to @xmath79 k. the photospheric velocity remains as high as @xmath80 km s@xmath10 during the wind phase .",
    "when the envelope mass decreases to below the critical mass , the wind stops and the photosphere rapidly shrinks towards its original size before the outburst , for example , from @xmath81 to @xmath82 within a week for @xmath51 .",
    "shortly after the wind stops , steady - state shell burning on the wd ends but hydrogen burning itself is still continuing and supplying a part of the luminosity . in this phase",
    ", the envelope mass is decreased only by nuclear burning .",
    "the rest of the luminosity comes from the thermal energy of the hydrogen envelope and the hot ash ( helium ) below the hydrogen layer .",
    "the thermal energy amounts to several times @xmath83 ergs for the case of @xmath51 , @xmath84 , and @xmath2 ( for the 1999 outburst of u sco ) .",
    "it can supply a bolometric luminosity of @xmath85 ergs s@xmath10 for about ten days or so .",
    "the mass lost by the wind , @xmath86 , and the mass added to the helium layer of the wd , @xmath87 , are calculated from @xmath88 and @xmath89 respectively .",
    "the efficiency of hydrogen shell - flashes ( nova outbursts ) is defined by @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the envelope mass at the optical maximum .    assuming a high constant rate of @xmath92 yr@xmath10 in equation ( [ dmdt_envelope_mass ] ) , we start the calculation . the envelope mass is quickly increased and the optical luminosity soon reaches the observational maximum in a day or so .",
    "then , we drop the rate to @xmath93 yr@xmath10 or zero and further follow the decay phase of nova .",
    "therefore , our rising phase is not a realistic one but just a rough sketch .",
    "once the envelope has reached the optical maximum , our theoretical light curve in the decay phase represents a realistic one because the flow in the envelope is approximately in a steady - state as already mentioned above .",
    "if the mass accretion rate ( @xmath35 ) does not vary , the envelope solution is obtained from @xmath94 in equation ( [ dmdt_envelope_mass ] ) .",
    "the mass accretion rate is in a balance with the mass decreasing rate of the envelope , @xmath95 if the steady mass - accretion rate is given , we can directly ( without integration ) obtain the corresponding state of the envelope from figures [ dmdtallsol ] and [ dmdtall_low_m ] .",
    "the critical envelope - mass decreasing rate , i.e. , at the cease point of wind , exactly coincides with the critical mass - accretion rate , i.e. , at the beginning point of wind , @xmath96 , which can be approximately expressed by @xmath97 for various wd masses ( @xmath98 ) and hydrogen contents ( @xmath99 ) with solar metallicity ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "this relation is reduced from our wind solutions for @xmath61 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 ( @xmath2 ) and has accuracy within to 35% .    in the same steady mass - accretion",
    "mentioned above , we also obtain the lower limit of the mass accretion rate for steady hydrogen shell - burning as @xmath104 for solar metallicity ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "this relation is reduced from our steady - state solutions for @xmath61 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 ( @xmath2 ) and has accuracy better than 10% .",
    "one of our binary models is graphically shown in figure [ m1370_tcrb_fig ] . a circular orbit is assumed .",
    "our light curves include the contributions of three components : photosphere of wd , red giant ( rg ) companion , and accretion disk ( acdk or dk ) .",
    "we assume a black - body photosphere of the wd envelope and calculate the @xmath105-magnitude with a window function given by allen ( 1973 ) .",
    "the photospheric surface is divided into 32 pieces in the latitudinal angle ( @xmath106 ) and into 64 pieces in the longitudinal angle ( @xmath107 ) as illustrated in figure [ m1370_tcrb_fig ] .",
    "the contributions to the @xmath105 light are summed up from each piece .",
    "we do not consider the limb - darkening effect because it is as small as @xmath108 mag .",
    "we have assumed the luminosity of the wd given by @xmath109 where the first term is the intrinsic luminosity of the wd calculated by our wind and steady hydrogen shell burning solutions and the second term is the accretion luminosity ( e.g. , starrfield , sparks , & shaviv 1988 ) ; @xmath110 is the radius of the wd ( e.g. , @xmath111 for @xmath112 wd ) .",
    "the accretion luminosity is as large as 700 @xmath113 for a mass accretion rate of @xmath93 yr@xmath10 onto a @xmath112 wd .",

    "such a radiation - induced , tilting instability of an accretion disk has been suggested by @xcite when a central star is as luminous as the eddington limit .",

    "thus , we need a more massive wd to generate a faster decline . therefore , we have determined the wd mass of @xmath256 in t crb , giving a much better fit with the observational points even in the day 010 .",
    "@xcite suggested from the observations of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite that the color index of t crb was about zero february 12 ( 4 days after maximum ) .",

    "this irradiation effect can be well seen both 1040 days after the optical maximum and 120260 days after the optical maximum .",
    "the irradiation effect was once examined and discarded by @xcite as a main mechanism of the secondary maximum , mainly because its maximum largely deviates from the observational secondary maximum as seen in the figure .",
    "the solid curve includes further the irradiated accretion disk . here",
    ", we have started the calculation by assuming the disk size of @xmath285 in equation ( [ accretion - disk - size ] ) , i.e. , @xmath286 .",
    "the photospheric radius expands to @xmath287 in order to fit the peak luminosity of the @xmath105 light .",
    "we have derived the distance modulus of @xmath288 .",
    "the light curve during the first 10 days of the 1946 outburst can be well reproduced only with the fast - developing wd photosphere of @xmath51 as already shown by @xcite .",
    "the envelope mass of the wd at the optical maximum is @xmath289 from our wind solutions .",
    "then , the mass accretion rate was estimated to be @xmath290 yr@xmath10 during the quiescent phase between 1866 and 1946 .",
    "this value is roughly consistent with the estimation of @xmath291 yr@xmath10 by @xcite .",
    "after the wd photosphere shrinks to smaller than @xmath292 , the accretion disk reappears but its contribution to the @xmath105 light is small as shown in figure [ vmag1370va1_tcrb1946 ] , because radiation emits mainly in uv .",
    "we assume a flaring - up rim of the accretion disk , i.e. , @xmath293 in equation ( [ flaring - up - disk ] ) , during the strong wind phase for the 1946 outburst of t crb , since @xcite suggested that the rim of the accretion disk is flaring - up during the 1999 outburst of u sco , then , the @xmath105 light is reduced 2030 days after maximum because the disk rim makes shadow on the red giant component .",
    "the warping of the accretion disk does not occur yet , because the strong wind suppresses the warping .",
    "the spherically symmetric wind momentum is much larger than the radiation momentum as shown by @xcite .",
    "warping ( or wobbling ) instability of the accretion disk begins to grow after the strong wind stops @xmath294 days after maximum ( on hjd 2,431,920 ) and , as a result , the @xmath105 light attains another peak .",
    "we expect that the radiation induced warping of the accretion disk grows in a time scale of a few tens of days as derived in equation ( [ precession_time_t_crb ] ) and further that the mass transfer from the red giant to the wd increases because the red giant surface is strongly irradiated and the roche lobe overflow is enhanced .",
    "such enhancement of the mass transfer certainly increases the radius of the optically thick region of the accretion disk up to @xmath295@xmath296 as suggested by @xcite .",
    "thus , we conclude that the radius of the optically thick accretion disk increased from @xmath285 ( @xmath292 ) to @xmath297 ( @xmath298 ) during the day @xmath14460150 , by fitting with the observational points as shown in figure [ vmag1370va1_tcrb1946 ] .",
    "the second peaks of the 1866 and 1946 outbursts are very similar .",
    "this is explained as follows : ( 1 ) the first peak ends up when the wind stops about 60 days after maximum .",
    "this period ( @xmath294 days ) , between the optical peak and the termination of the strong wind , is almost uniquely determined by the wd mass .",
    "( 2 ) the second peak begins to rise when the warping of the accretion disk grows , which is about 120 days after maximum .",
    "the growth time is estimated to be about a few times 30 days as in equation ( [ precession_time_t_crb ] ) .",
    "this growth time depends on the mass ( @xmath299 ) and the optically thick radius ( @xmath243 ) of disk , which are determined mainly by the mass transfer rate from the red giant companion .",
    "we can naturally expect the similar time scales between the 1866 and 1946 outbursts , because the irradiation of the red giant by the wd photosphere is almost the same .",
    "( 3 ) thus , we are able to obtain quite similar light curves if the orbital phases of the 1866 and 1946 outbursts happen to be the same ( see the light curves of the 1866 and 1946 outbursts , * ? ? ?",
    "accidentally , the two orbital phases were almost similar to each other .",
    "the precessing period of the warping disk is similar to the growth time of warping ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "about 60% faster precessing angular velocity than the orbital motion is required from the phase relation between the rising shoulder of the second peak near hjd 2,431,960 , a small dip near hjd 2,432,090 , and then a small bump near hjd 2,432,120 as shown in figure [ vmag1370va1_tcrb1946 ] .",
    "these dips are caused by a large shadow on the companion cast by the accretion disk .",
    "in other words , the accretion disk blocks the light from the wd photosphere and makes its shadow on the companion surface .",
    "finally , we have determined @xmath300 days by fitting .",
    "this period is similar to the 164 days precessing period of ss 433 .",
    "@xcite summarized the observational development of the 1946 outburst , showing the color index at the second peak of @xmath301 after correcting the reddening of @xmath302 .",
    "they further pointed out that the reflection by the m - giant is about @xmath303 , therefore , rejected the possibility of reflection by the m - giant .",
    "instead , they suggested that the much bluer color index of @xmath304 is typical of the accretion disks seen in outbursting accretion - powered symbiotic stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . in our warping - disk model ,",
    "the color index is ranging from @xmath305 ( on hjd 2,432,000 ) to @xmath306 ( on hjd 2,432,050 ) , which is reasonably consistent with the observational color at the second peak because the reflection effect by the warping disk dominates during the second peak rather than the irradiated m - giant .",
    "ever since the emission lines of , , , [ ] , [ ] , and [ ] first appeared , they have been always present until two years after the outburst , except in early june , at the most , from may 15 to july 17 , 1946 ( @xmath307135 days after maximum , * ? ? ?",

    "their main results are summarized as : ( 1 ) the first 4 days light curve of the outbursts can be well reproduced with a tnr model based on a @xmath335 and an apparent distance modulus of @xmath336 . ( 2 ) to reproduce the @xmath105 and uv light curves in the late stage ( @xmath337100 days after the optical maximum ) , the contributions of the irradiated m - giant and the irradiated accretion disk must be introduced .",
    "( 3 ) the distance to rs oph is estimated to be 0.6 kpc both from the @xmath105 and uv light curve fittings with the absorption of @xmath338 .",
    "( 4 ) about 90% envelope mass of the wd has been blown off in the wind but the residual 10% has been left on the wd .",
    "thus , @xcite has concluded that rs oph will explode as an sn ia in the near future if the hot component is a carbon - oxygen white dwarf .    in hachisu & kato s ( 2000a ) calculations",
    ", they assumed the solar metallicity ( @xmath2 ) of the m - giant envelope .",
    "however , it has recently been suggested that the cool component of rs oph is a metal - poor giant .",
    "@xcite obtained the carbon abundance of [ c / h]@xmath339 for rs oph 143 days after the 1985 outburst and of [ c / h]@xmath340 in 1992 .",
    "similar depletions of carbon , oxygen , neon , sulphur , and iron with respect to solar values are suggested by @xcite .",
    "they obtained one or two tenths of the solar values for c , o , ne , s , and fe , in order to reproduce the line ratios based on their shock models of nova shells . @xcite",
    "estimated metal abundance of ag dra as [ fe / h]@xmath341 and suggested that all yellow symbiotic stars including rs oph are metal - poor .",
    "they attributed k6 i  ii to the cool component of rs oph .    if the envelope of the white dwarf is also metal - poor , the mass determination of the white dwarf from the light curve fitting may not be correct because the optically thick wind is driven by iron lines and the decay timescale is much longer in low metallicity envelopes .",
    "therefore , we must reexamine the light curves of the 1985 outburst by introducing lower metallicities and study the possible range of the metallicity and the wd mass .      assuming an extremely massive white dwarf of @xmath342 just prior to the sn ia explosion",
    ", we have calculated light curves for various metallicities of @xmath343 , 0.004 , 0.01 , and 0.02 as shown in figure [ metal_mix_rsoph1985 ] .",

    "the case of @xmath62 is too slow to be compatible with the observations .",
    "thus , we may conclude that the metallicity is @xmath344 .",

    "for the set of @xmath342 and @xmath4 , we have obtained the envelope mass at the optical maximum , @xmath345 , which indicates a mass accretion rate of @xmath11 yr@xmath10 during the quiescent phase between the 1968 and the 1985 outbursts .",

    "@xcite obtained the radial velocities of the m - type feature and the a - type feature but concluded that the a - type absorption feature does not associate with any of the components .",

    "the late - phase @xmath105 light curve ( @xmath383100 days after maximum ) indicates strong irradiation of the acdk .",
    "we have examined the case of a lobe - filling rg companion ( @xmath370 ) , but the irradiation of the rg is too luminous to be compatible with the observational light curves . on the other hand , a smaller size of the rg such as @xmath378 ( @xmath384 ) gives a reasonable fit with the observations as shown in figures [ vmag1377va1_rsoph1985fixdisk ] and [ vmag1377va1_rsoph1985vardisk ] .    to fit the late - phase light curve ,",

    "moreover , the strong irradiation increases the mass transfer rate from the red giant component ; thus increasing the radius of the optically thick region of the accretion disk .",
    "the unstable warping grows shortly after the hot wind stops because the mass transfer rate satisfies the warping condition ( [ radiation_condition_t_crb ] ) .    on the other hand",
    ", the rs oph system can not maintain the mass transfer because the cool red giant wind has once been evacuated by the outburst ( hot ) wind / ejecta from the white dwarf . during the day 080 ( hot wind phase ) , the growth of warping was suppressed by the hot wind because the hot wind ( matter ) momentum is much larger than the photon momentum as shown by @xcite . during the day 80120 ( steady burning phase ) , the warping instability may grow to some extent .",
    "however , the disk can not contribute much to the @xmath105 light , since the optically thick region of the accretion disk has become as small as or smaller than @xmath524 .",
    "the mass transfer to the white dwarf resumes @xmath525 days after the optical maximum , that is , after the hot wind stops ( @xmath526 days ) and then the cool red giant wind fills again the binary system ( @xmath527 km s@xmath10 = 300 days ) as already discussed earlier . at that time , the luminosity of the white dwarf has once decreased as low as @xmath528@xmath529 and too low ( two orders of magnitude lower ) to excite the warping instability as easily understood from the condition for rs oph @xcite , i.e. , @xmath530 in the cool wind accretion phase , our estimated accretion rate of the wd in rs oph is @xmath531 yr@xmath10 ( therefore , @xmath532 ergs s@xmath10 for the accretion luminosity ) , which also does not meet the above condition even if @xmath533 , so that the radiation - induced instability does not occur in rs oph .",
    "this is the reason why rs oph does not show a second peak .    the other two , v745 sco and v3890 sgr , are similar systems to rs oph , so that a secondary maximum was not observed , as will be shown in the following sections .",

    "in other words , the early visual light curve can be well reproduced only by a bloated white dwarf photosphere of @xmath535 for a low metallicity of @xmath4 . on the other hand , @xmath536 is obtained for the solar metallicity of @xmath2 .",
    "+ ( 2 ) the ensuing phase ( @xmath53780 days ) visual light curve can not be reproduced only by a white dwarf photosphere .",

    "+ ( 3 ) the uv light curve can also be well reproduced with the same model as that of the visual luminosity .",
    "the early phase uv flux mainly comes from the bloated white dwarf photosphere while the late phase uv flux comes from the irradiated disk surface because the main emitting region of the white dwarf photosphere has shift from uv to soft x - ray in the late stage .",
    "+ ( 4 ) the optically thick wind stops on the day @xmath14480 .",
    "the wd photosphere quickly shrinks . the sharp drop in the uv flux around the day 80",

    "thus , we have obtained the best fit model for the wd mass of @xmath636 as shown in figures [ vmag1350va1_fixdk_v3890sgr ] and [ vmag1350va1_comp_v3890sgr ] .",
    "the envelope mass at the maximum @xmath105 light is estimated to be @xmath637 , indicating a mass transfer rate of @xmath638 yr@xmath10 between the 1962 and 1990 outbursts .",
    "the efficiency of the acdk irradiation has been examined for other two cases of @xmath639 ( dot - dashed line ) and 0.25 ( dotted line ) only for @xmath61 and @xmath640 as shown in figure [ vmag1350va1_comp_v3890sgr ] .",
    "we have examined the dependency of the @xmath105 light curve on the orbital inclination angle .",
    "the luminosity of the acdk depends largely on the the orbital inclination angle mainly because a larger area of the acdk can be seen from the earth for a smaller inclination angle .",
    "therefore , the inclination angle should be as low as @xmath641 to reproduce the @xmath105 light curve during @xmath38320 days after maximum .",
    "we have also calculated @xmath105-light curves for other four cases of the companion mass , i.e. , @xmath6420.6 , 0.7 , 0.8 , and @xmath643 , but obtained similar light curves to @xmath271 .",
    "we have checked the other case of @xmath590 k , but found no significant differences in the light curves .",
    "the power of @xmath132 is fixed to be @xmath133 , but we can not find any significant differences in the light curves even if we adopt @xmath134 . finally , we have study the effect of hydrogen content . either the early- or late - phase @xmath105 light curve depends hardly on the hydrogen content @xmath99 as shown in figure [ vmag1350va1_comp_v3890sgr ] .",
    "the optically thick , outburst wind stops 56 , 68 , and 80 days after maximum , and the steady hydrogen shell burning ends 68 , 89 , and 122 days after maximum , for @xmath580 , 0.50 , and 0.70 , respectively .",
    "@xcite obtained optical spectra 1820 days after maximum .",
    "they pointed out that these line features closely resembles the spectrum of rs oph 60 days after maximum .",
    "anupama & sethi derived the zanstra temperature @xmath644 k of the ionizing central source from the helium and hydrogen line ( h@xmath131 and 4686  ) ratios and its radius @xmath645 from h@xmath131 line flux .",
    "for rs oph , our model gives us @xmath646 k and @xmath647 about 70 days after maximum ( see the previous section ) , being roughly consistent with the zanstra temperature derived by anupama & sethi .",
    "for v3890 sgr , however , our model suggests @xmath648 k and @xmath649 on the day 18 , being not consistent .",
    "this may indicate the importance of the contribution from the shocked layer photons .",
    "@xcite obtained optical spectrum on may 14 ( 17 days after maximum ) . comparing them with the earlier spectra observed by @xcite and @xcite , mukai et al .",
    "pointed out that v3890 sgr had progressed to a higher ionization state on that day . in our modeling of the light curve",
    ", the accretion disk plays a key role in these days .",
    "it is very likely that the conspicuous change in the spectrum @xmath650 days after maximum is caused by the evaporation of the accretion disk .",
    "as seen in figure [ vmag1350va1_fixdk_v3890sgr ] , the disk size decreases to @xmath651 on the day @xmath650 .",
    "then , the mean temperature of the disk surface increases to @xmath652 k. the same thing happens in rs oph around the day @xmath1446070 .",
    "we thus suggest a very small size of the optically thick acdk or no disk , that is , @xmath653 , in the late phase ( after hjd 2,448,036 , indicated by `` disk vanishes '' in figure [ vmag1350va1_fixdk_v3890sgr ] ) .",
    "therefore , no secondary maximum of the light curve is expected as well as in rs oph and v745 sco .",
    "fitting indicates an apparent distance modulus of @xmath654 .",
    "thus , the distance to v3890 sgr is derived to be @xmath655 kpc if we adopt the absorption of @xmath656 , where @xmath657 @xcite , because the distance modulus is @xmath658 .",
    "this is roughly consistent with harrison et al.s ( 1993 ) estimation of @xmath659 kpc .",
    "harrison et al . determined the infrared spectral type of the cool companion as m5 iii . assuming @xmath660 ( m5 iii )",
    ", they obtained the distance modulus of @xmath661 by using @xcite relation of @xmath318 .",
    "it should be noted here that there are a large divergence in the observed color excesses : @xcite determined @xmath662 from uv lines ; @xcite obtained @xmath663 from h i and he ii line ratios ; @xcite obtained @xmath550 from the line ratios , and @xmath664 from the h@xmath665h@xmath131 ratio .",
    "finally , we examine the possibility of type ia supernova explosion .",
    "the envelope mass at the maximum @xmath105 light is estimated to be @xmath637 from our solutions , indicating a mass transfer rate of @xmath638 yr@xmath10 between the 1962 and 1990 outbursts . moreover , about 90% of the envelope mass has been blown off in the outburst wind and the residual 10% ( @xmath666 ) has been left and added to the helium layer of the wd .",
    "therefore , we obtain the net mass increasing rate of @xmath667 yr@xmath10 .",
    "this meets condition ( [ low_accretion_condition_for_snia ] ) of sn ia explosion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , if the wd consists of carbon and oxygen .",
    "thus , we may conclude that v3890 sgr is an immediate progenitor of type ia supernova if the hot component is a carbon - oxygen white dwarf .",
    "the white dwarf can grow to @xmath668 even if mild helium shell flashes repeatedly occur after the helium layer grows to the critical mass at which helium ignites ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we have developed a numerical method for calculating light curves of recurrent nova outbursts .",
    "our basic model consists of a white dwarf with an accretion disk and a red giant companion .",
    "the calculated light curves includes contributions from the white dwarf photosphere , the irradiated accretion disk , and the irradiated red giant .",
    "we summarize our main results on the light curve analysis of the four recurrent novae with a red giant companion , t crb , rs oph , v745 sco , and v3890 sgr .",
    "the mass of white dwarf ( wd ) has been estimated , from the decline of early - phase light curve , to be @xmath0 for t crb , @xmath1 with solar metallicity ( @xmath2 ) or @xmath3 with low metallicity ( @xmath4 ) for rs oph , @xmath1 for v745 sco , and @xmath1 for v3890 sgr .",
    "the apparent distance moduli are obtained , with the light curve fitting , to be @xmath669 for t crb , @xmath670 for rs oph , @xmath671 for v745 sco , and @xmath672 for v3890 sgr .",
    "therefore , the distances are estimated to be @xmath308 kpc with @xmath673 for t crb , @xmath397 kpc with @xmath338 for rs oph , @xmath610 kpc with @xmath674 for v745 sco , and @xmath675 kpc with @xmath676 for v3890 sgr .",
    "* each envelope mass at the optical maximum is also calculated to be @xmath5 ( t crb ) , @xmath6 ( rs oph ) , @xmath7 ( v745 sco ) , @xmath8 ( v3890 sgr ) , which indicates an average mass accretion rate of @xmath9 yr@xmath10 ( 80 yrs , t crb ) , @xmath11 yr@xmath10 ( 18 yrs , rs oph ) , @xmath12 yr@xmath10 ( 52 yrs , v745 sco ) , @xmath13 yr@xmath10 ( 28 yrs , v3890 sgr ) during quiescent phase .",
    "although a large part of the envelope mass is blown in the wind , each white dwarf can retain a substantial part of the envelope mass after hydrogen burning .",
    "thus , we have obtained net mass - increasing rates of the wds , @xmath677 yr@xmath10 ( t crb ) , @xmath15 yr@xmath10 ( rs oph ) , @xmath16 yr@xmath10 ( v745 sco ) , @xmath17 yr@xmath10 ( v3890 sgr ) .",
    "these results strongly indicate that the white dwarfs in recurrent novae have now grown up to near the chandrasekhar mass limit and will soon explode as a type ia supernova if the white dwarf consists of carbon and oxygen .",
    "* among the four recurrent novae with a red giant companion , only t crb shows a secondary maximum 120190 days after the optical maximum .",
    "this secondary maximum can be well reproduced if an irradiated accretion disk of @xmath298 around the white dwarf tilts due to a radiation - induced warping instability .",
    "if we neglect the accretion disk , we can not fully reproduce the secondary peak by an irradiated m - giant model .",
    "the difference between t crb and the others is in the companion : it fills its inner critical roche lobe only in t crb but in the others does not .",
    "therefore , in t crb the mass transfer is mainly driven by the roche lobe overflow while in the other systems matter is fed by cool red giant winds . in t crb , the mass transfer continues even in the outburst wind phase , which maintains an optically thick accretion disk large enough to show a secondary maximum after a tilting instability grows up .",
    "the other three systems , rs oph , v745 sco , and v3890 sgr , can not maintain the mass transfer during the outburst because the cool red giant wind has once been evacuated by the ejecta of the outburst .",
    "the light curves of rs oph and v3890 sgr require a relatively large size accretion disk of @xmath418 in the mid - phase but a small size of @xmath249 in the late - phase .",
    "the late - phase uv data of rs oph can be well reproduced with a small accretion disk of @xmath678 .",
    "no or a very small accretion disk is also derived in v745 sco .",
    "these accretion disks are quickly dissipating to become as small as @xmath249 , at least , in the late phase of the outbursts , because no mass is fed .",
    "such a small disk can not contribute much to the @xmath105 light .",
    "even if the tilting instability begins to grow after the wind stops , it is therefore very unlikely that secondary maxima like in t crb are observed in these three systems .",
    "the post - outburst minima of rs oph outbursts , which is 1 mag ( in @xmath105 ) below the quiescent level and continues for @xmath679 days from 100 to 400 days after the optical maximum , is understood from the evacuation of the cool red giant wind by the ejecta of nova .",
    "after the hot wd wind stops 80 days after the optical maximum , the cool red giant wind expands to recover again in @xmath679 days .",
    "then , @xmath525 days after maximum , mass accretion from the red giant wind to the white dwarf resumes .",
    "supersoft x - rays from the white dwarf , which were observed about 250 days after maximum , are very consistent with the end of hot wd wind and the evacuation of the cool red giant wind .",

    "<S> theoretical light curves of four recurrent novae in outburst are modeled to obtain various physical parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the four objects studied here are those with a red giant companion , i.e. , t coronae borealis , rs ophiuchi , v745 scorpii , and v3890 sagittarii . </S>",
    "<S> our model consists of a very massive white dwarf ( wd ) with an accretion disk and a red giant companion . </S>",
    "<S> light curve calculation includes reflection effects of the companion star and the accretion disk together with a shadowing effect on the companion by the accretion disk . </S>",
    "<S> we also include a radiation - induced warping instability of the accretion disk to reproduce the second peak of t crb outbursts . </S>",
    "<S> the early visual light curves are well reproduced with a thermonuclear runaway model on a very massive white dwarf close to the chandrasekhar mass limit , i.e. , @xmath0 for t crb , @xmath1 for rs oph with solar metallicity ( @xmath2 ) but @xmath3 for rs oph with low metallicity ( @xmath4 ) , @xmath1 for v745 sco , and @xmath1 for v3890 sgr . </S>",
    "<S> optically thick winds , which blow from the wds during the outbursts , play a key role in determining the nova duration and the speed of decline because the wind quickly reduces the envelope mass on the wd . </S>",
    "<S> each envelope mass at the optical maximum is also estimated to be @xmath5 ( t crb ) , @xmath6 ( rs oph ) , @xmath7 ( v745 sco ) , @xmath8 ( v3890 sgr ) , indicating an average mass accretion rate @xmath9 yr@xmath10 ( 80 yrs , t crb ) , @xmath11 yr@xmath10 ( 18 yrs , rs oph ) , @xmath12 yr@xmath10 ( 52 yrs , v745 sco ) , @xmath13 yr@xmath10 ( 28 yrs , v3890 sgr ) during the quiescent phase before the last outburst . </S>",
    "<S> although a large part of the envelope mass is blown in the wind , each wd can retain a substantial part of the envelope mass after hydrogen burning ends . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we have obtained net mass - increasing rates of the wds as @xmath14 yr@xmath10 ( t crb ) , @xmath15 yr@xmath10 ( rs oph ) , @xmath16 yr@xmath10 ( v745 sco ) , @xmath17 yr@xmath10 ( v3890 sgr ) . </S>",
    "<S> these results strongly indicate that the wds in the recurrent novae have now grown up to near the chandrasekhar mass limit and will soon explode as a type ia supernova if the wds consist of carbon and oxygen . </S>",
    "<S> we have also clarified the reason why only t crb shows a secondary maximum but the other three systems do not . </S>"
