    "in order to describe the meson gas formed after a relativistic heavy ion collision ( rhic ) for temperatures below chiral symmetry restoration , chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) is the most general theoretical scheme @xcite and its predictions are based only on chiral symmetry . when applied to the low-@xmath1 meson gas",
    ", one can analyze static quantities such as the pressure @xcite , quark condensate @xcite and pion decay constants @xcite .",
    "all these quantities point towards chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "in addition , the analysis of the pion dispersion relation @xmath2 shows that to leading order @xmath3 , @xmath4 is real and depends only on temperature but not on momenta @xcite while corrections to the pion width start to @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "recently , we have shown that chpt is equally useful to describe dynamical quantities such as scattering amplitudes @xcite or form factors @xcite . furthermore , combining chiral symmetry breaking and unitarity provides a fruitful approach to describe the thermal behaviour of resonances @xcite such as the @xmath0 , whose medium properties are crucial to explain the excess observed in the dilepton spectrum data @xcite , which has motivated a huge amount of theoretical work devoted to explain in - medium resonances @xcite .",
    "the main contribution to the dilepton rate comes from the pion annihilation channel via a virtual photon exchange @xmath6 .",
    "the dilepton rate is then proportional to the pion electromagnetic form factor @xcite which for @xmath7 has the following general form :    @xmath8    with @xmath9 the electromagnetic current , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 even functions in @xmath15 by charge conjugation invariance .",
    "these functions are related by the gauge invariance ward identity @xmath16 .",
    "= 2.8 in    we have calculated the one - loop chpt form factors , whose detailed results can be found in @xcite .",
    "this allows for model - independent predictions .",
    "for instance , defining the pion electromagnetic charge and radius as : @xmath17 which takes into account lorentz covariance breaking at @xmath7 , one finds the result shown in figure [ fig : rad ] .",
    "the radius remains almost constant for low @xmath1 , which is consistent with the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) idea that @xmath18 @xcite , provided @xmath19 changes little at low temperatures . on the other hand ,",
    "the radius increases significantly for higher temperatures , dominated by a @xmath20 reduction ( charge screening ) . estimating the critical temperature of deconfinement by requiring that the electromagnetic pion volume @xmath21 equals the inverse pion density gives @xmath22 mev , very close to the prediction of chpt for chiral symmetry restoration @xcite .",
    "this gives support to the idea that both transitions take place nearly at the same point .",
    "our results for the pion charge radius confirm those in @xcite based on qcd sum rules .",
    "in the center of mass frame ( @xmath23 , corresponding to back to back dilepton pairs ) the chpt pion form factor satisfies the following perturbative unitarity relation for energies above the two - pion threshold @xmath24 :    @xmath25^*\\label{pertunit}\\ ] ]    with : @xmath26\\ ] ]    the superscripts @xmath27 and @xmath28 indicate the lo and nlo chpt contributions respectively and @xmath29 denote pion scattering partial waves with definite isospin @xmath30 and angular momentum @xmath31 .",
    "note that @xmath32 but we have displayed it in the above equation for consistency with what follows . here , @xmath33 is the thermal two - particle phase space , which can be understood by writing it as @xmath34 $ ] where @xmath35^{-1}$ ] is the bose - einstein distribution function for each pion .",
    "hence , the phase space is enhanced at finite temperature due to the difference between induced emission and absorption processes in the thermal bath @xcite .",
    "this effect contributes to the resonance thermal width enhancement @xcite .",
    "the partial waves @xmath29 also satisfy a thermal perturbative unitarity relation @xcite which is the @xmath36 one with @xmath37 replaced by @xmath33 , as in ( [ pertunit ] ) .",
    "thermal perturbative unitarity is the key point to describe resonances within chpt .",
    "in fact , inspired by the success of the so called inverse amplitude method ( iam ) at @xmath36 @xcite we have constructed unitarized partial waves and form factors demanding _ exact _ thermal unitarity .",
    "for instance , @xmath38^*$ ] .",
    "the remaining freedom is fixed by matching the chpt series at low energies .",
    "this approximation is valid for small pion densities @xmath39 , which is very reasonable for the temperatures and energies we are interested in .",
    "the iam generates the @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) and @xmath0 ( @xmath42 ) poles in the energy complex plane and their thermal behaviour is the expected one . in figure",
    "[ fig : poles ] we have plotted the results for the poles and for the unitarized form factor .",
    "the @xmath0 widens in the thermal bath , effect also visible in the form factor , peaked at the @xmath0 mass .",
    "such widening is in perfect agreement with the expectations from dilepton experiments and previous analysis @xcite .",
    "our resulting @xmath19 remains almost constant for @xmath43 100 mev ( consistently with vmd ) and decreases slightly for higher @xmath1 .",
    "this result points in the same direction as recent measurements by the star collaboration @xcite but we have ignored other medium effects such as baryon density . the in - medium @xmath0 mass remains certainly an open issue @xcite . as for the @xmath40 pole ,",
    "the results in figure [ fig : poles ] show a behaviour compatible with chiral symmetry restoration : @xmath44 decreases sharply , hence approaching @xmath45 which increases softly with @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath40 width increases at first by phase space enhancement but as @xmath46 the decay @xmath47 is reduced and so does the width .",
    "a similar behaviour has been found in @xcite .",
    "= 2.9 in    summarizing , chpt and its unitarization programme can be extended successfully to finite temperature and provide a promising framework for future applications in the context of relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
