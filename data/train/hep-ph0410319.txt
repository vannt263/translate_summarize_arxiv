    "the discovery of neutrino masses and mixing makes the see - saw mechanism @xcite highly attractive .",
    "the existence of heavy singlet neutrinos with majorana masses @xmath2 and yukawa couplings @xmath3 to the active neutrinos becomes very likely .",
    "this framework can also dynamically generate the baryon asymmetry of the universe by leptogenesis @xcite .",
    "the supersymmetric extension of this model ( ssm+n ) is well motivated because it protects the higgs mass from large radiative corrections involving the heavy neutrino .",
    "supersymmetry must be broken , hence the ssm+n includes soft supersymmetry breaking terms for the ssm fields and for the singlet sneutrino field @xmath4 .",
    "the singlet sneutrino soft terms , in turn , can affect leptogenesis and even give the dominant contribution for low enough masses ( @xmath5 gev ) and small yukawa couplings ( @xmath6 ) @xcite .    in general , only the lightest singlet ( s)neutrino contributes to leptogenesis , since its interactions wash out any lepton asymmetry created by the heavier singlet sneutrinos . however , this lightest singlet ( s)neutrino , even with @xmath7 , is practically impossible to discover at colliders , since the yukawa couplings need to be small enough in order for the decay to be out of equilibrium .",
    "singlet ( s)neutrinos contribute , however , to electric dipole moments ( edm ) of leptons , @xmath8 , and to lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) interactions @xcite .",
    "these measurements already constrain various ssm soft breaking terms @xcite , especially their phases which should be @xmath9 to be consistent with the non observation of edms @xcite ( however , this limit is significantly weakened if @xmath10 @xcite ) .",
    "much work has been devoted to the possible connection between leptogenesis and edm and lfv measurements @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we briefly describe the ssm+n model in section [ notessec ] .",
    "then we estimate the contribution of soft breaking terms that can induce leptogenesis to @xmath11 in section [ edmsec ] , and to the lfv interactions @xmath12 and @xmath13 , in section [ lfvsec ] .",
    "we conclude in section [ concsec ] .",
    "our main result is that soft leptogenesis gives small low - energy phenomenological effects , so that present and near future experiments of edm and lfv do not constrain it .    in our previous works @xcite , we considered for simplicity a one generation model .",
    "since soft leptogenesis constrains only the couplings of the lightest sneutrino , @xmath14 , we only consider its contribution to the edm and to lfv interactions and not all @xmath15 contributions .",
    "the relevant superpotential terms of the ssm+n are @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the supermultiplet containing the left handed lepton , @xmath18 are the su(2)-singlet superfields of the neutrino and charged lepton respectively , and @xmath19 are the higgs superfields .",

    "we investigated the contributions of @xmath30 and @xmath31 to leptogenesis .",

    "[ edm fig ] . in the sneutrino mass matrix , we neglect terms of order @xmath42 , assume the hierarchy @xmath43 .",

    "the result is then @xmath68 we use here @xmath69 , @xmath70 tev , @xmath71 , and the bound from leptogenesis for out of equilibrium decay : @xmath72 the contribution of @xmath73 is significant only if @xmath74 gev , when @xmath73 can assume its natural value , @xmath75 , since only then it has no restriction from soft leptogenesis @xcite .",
    "note that for large @xmath2 , @xmath76 gev , there is a two loop contribution of the same order , where @xmath73 generates an @xmath77 term through 1-loop diagrams @xcite .",

    "we conclude that the upper limit ( [ edmslg ] ) on the contributions to the edm of the electron related to @xmath63 and @xmath73 is well below the sensitivities of current ( [ edm exp ] ) and future ( [ edm future ] ) experiments .    assuming that @xmath14 has comparable mixing with all three flavors of @xmath35",

    "flavor changing couplings come only from @xmath3 and @xmath63 . in a general ssm , there are arbitrary flavor changing mass - squared terms for sleptons already at high scale , and their contributions can not be separated from the contribution of @xmath3 and @xmath63 .",
    "thus only in models of universality , there is a correlation between lfv observables and leptogenesis parameters .",
    "we use here renormalization group equation ( rge ) to find the low scale values of the soft breaking terms .",
    "the leading contribution to the branching ratio comes from gaugino interactions , and is denoted here by @xmath90 .",
    "it depends on the off - diagonal elements of the doublet slepton mass - squared matrix as follows : @xmath91 ^ 2      \\sim \\frac { \\alpha^3}{g_f^2 } \\frac{|m^2_{\\tilde l ij}|^2 }      { \\tilde m^8 } \\tan^2 \\beta\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the last expression is the known approximation @xcite and @xmath92 we take the off - diagonal elements of the slepton mass matrix @xmath93 to vanish at the planck scale , and use rge to evolve it to low energy .",
    "the relevant one - loop rge is @xcite @xmath94 assuming that @xmath95 , one gets @xmath96 for @xmath97 . from soft leptogenesis",
    "we can estimate : @xmath98 this gives @xmath99 with @xmath97 , and consequently @xmath100 where we used @xmath101 gev to maximize the possible effects .",
    "note that this contribution does not involve cp violation . comparing this result to ( [ branch exp ] , [ branch future ] ) ,",
    "we conclude that this contribution is unobservably small .",
    "the main reason is that @xmath102 , and soft leptogenesis requires a very small yukawa coupling @xmath3 ( see ( [ y limit ] ) ) .",

    "we learn that both contributions are much smaller than present limits and future sensitivity .    in the ssm+n ,",
    "the gaugino contribution to @xmath114 is almost always dominant in the @xmath115 conversion , and hence there is a relation between the predicted @xmath116 and @xmath13 : @xmath117 where @xmath118 ( g.s",

    "the current limit @xcite and near future expected sensitivity @xcite are @xmath119 we learn from ( [ br gg estimate ] ) that our estimate , @xmath120 is below the near future expected sensitivity .",

    "therefore , the lighter is @xmath2 , the less suppressed is the singlet sneutrino contribution .",
    "one may think therefore that soft leptogenesis , which requires @xmath2 to be lighter than standard leptogenesis , can have more significant phenomenological consequences . however , both the electron edm and the branching ratio of @xmath122 strongly depend on @xmath3 : @xmath123 since the yukawa couplings of @xmath14 must be small , @xmath6 , for out of equilibrium decay ( [ lg bound ] ) , these contributions are strongly suppressed .",
    "we learn that the contribution of soft supersymmetry breaking terms that induce soft leptogenesis to low energy observables is much smaller than other contributions in the ssm .",
    "the analysis here is model independent , in the sense that we do not use any flavor model for the structure of the yukawa matrix .",
    "we considered only @xmath14 contributions , and the constraints from successful soft leptogenesis on @xmath124 , @xmath125 and soft breaking terms of @xmath14 .",
    "the contributions to edms and lfv processes from the heavier singlet sneutrinos are not directly constrained by leptogenesis , and therefore can be larger . and @xmath2 for the heavier singlet neutrinos .",
    "then soft leptogenesis as the dominant source of the baryon asymmetry and @xmath126 within the sensitivity of future experiments can be simultaneously obtained .",
    "however , the dominant contribution to the lfv interactions there comes from heavier sneutrinos and not from @xmath14 . ]",
