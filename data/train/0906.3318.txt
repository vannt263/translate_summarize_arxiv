    "the dominant formation mechanism of early - type galaxies remains one of the long - standing debates of modern astrophysics . the classical monolithic model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggests that early - type galaxies form in highly efficient starbursts at high redshifts and evolve without much residual star formation from that point onward . on the other hand ,",
    "the popular lambda cold dark matter ( @xmath9cdm ) paradigm strongly suggests a hierarchical merger scenario for massive early - type galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . in this model ,",
    "early - type galaxies form as the result of successive mergers and are thought to have continued or episodic star formation events .",
    "numerous tests discriminate between these scenarios .",
    "for example , the optical colour - magnitude relations ( cmrs ) of early - type galaxies consistently reveal a small scatter around the mean relation ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , apparently supporting the monolithic scenario .",
    "deep imaging surveys have however shown that many early - types possess shells , tidal features ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and signatures of ongoing or recent star formation ( rsf ; e.g. ngc  2865 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "integral - field spectroscopy now also allows to obtain spatially resolved maps of various galaxy properties .",
    "for example , we have previously highlighted the importance of central stellar discs and kinematically - decoupled cores in the sauron sample ( e.g. , @xcite , hereafter @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , the _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( _ galex _ ) satellite opened up the ultraviolet ( uv ) window , allowing to probe the recent star formation history of galaxies with much greater accuracy than was previously possible with only optical information .",
    "the rest - frame uv is one order of magnitude more sensitive than the optical to the presence of hot stars , easily revealing populations younger than @xmath10  gyr .",
    "@xcite used _ galex _ medium imaging survey data to construct the first near ultraviolet ( nuv ) cmr of early - type galaxies classified by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "they found a remarkably large scatter towards blue colours and interpreted it as evidence of recent star formation . @xcite and",
    "@xcite subsequently found that the fraction of early - type galaxies that experienced recent star formation in the last billion years can be greater than @xmath11  per cent .",
    "@xcite further concluded that the star formation rates of nearby early - type galaxies derived from mid - infrared imaging are in good agreement with the uv results .",
    "there is thus clear evidence for residual star formation in the local early - type galaxy population and for its influence on global scaling relations , at least colour - magnitude relations .",
    "the fundamental plane ( fp ) is another key scaling relation of early - type galaxies , a two - dimensional plane in the three - dimensional manifold of their global structural parameters ( effective radius , surface brightness and stellar velocity dispersion ; e.g.@xcite ) , and may also be affected by rsf . under the assumption of structural homology ( i.e.  that all early - type galaxies have the same mass distribution and kinematics ) , the virial theorem implies that the fp parameters should scale in a specific manner , but observations reveal a _ tilt _ of the fp away from the virial prediction .",
    "numerous studies have investigated this , and the observed tilt has been attributed to a variation of the mass - to - light ratio across the sequence of early - type galaxies and/or to the breaking of the homology assumption ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , much debate still exists on the origin of the tilt and the scatter about the mean relation ( e.g.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "spatially - resolved galaxy data provide valuable information on the details of the stellar population distributions , especially when combined with uv data .",
    "hence , we aim here to obtain a uv database matching the sauron integral - field data , and present spatially - resolved uv and optical imaging of most early - type galaxies in the sauron survey .",
    "numerous investigations can be performed with such a database , but we will focus here on revisiting the effects of star formation on the scaling relations of early - types , particularly colour - magnitude relations and the fundamental plane .",
    "longstanding enigmas such as the uv - upturn phenomenon ( see @xcite and references therein ) are closely related .    in this paper , we thus present and discuss our uv imaging of sauron early - type galaxies obtained with _ galex _ , along with ground - based optical imaging from the mdm observatory . in   [ sec : obs ] , we present a brief summary of the sauron survey and our optical observations , and then describe at length the _ galex _ observations and surface photometry . in   [ sec : discussion ] , we discuss the uv colour - magnitude relations , the first uv fundamental planes , and make an attempt at interpreting radial uv@xmath3optical colour profiles .",
    "we summarize our findings in   [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the sauron observations are aimed at determining the two - dimensional stellar kinematics ( @xcite , hereafter @xcite ) , stellar linestrengths ( @xcite , hereafter @xcite ) and ionised gas kinematics ( @xcite , hereafter @xcite ) of @xmath1 nearby early - type galaxies and @xmath12 spiral bulges in the field and clusters ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the observations and data reduction are described in the relevant papers .",
    "detailed dynamical modeling is also available ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter @xcite ) .",

    ". the field - of - view of the mdm images is @xmath14 with @xmath15 pixels , allowing for accurate sky subtraction and proper sampling of the seeing .",

    "we obtained both fuv ( @xmath17@xmath18   ) and nuv ( @xmath18@xmath19   ) images of @xmath0 e / s0 galaxies using the medium - depth imaging mode of _ galex _ , as part of an ongoing uv imaging survey of the sauron sample ( _ galex _ guest investigator programmes gi1109 and gi3041 ) and the _ galex _ nearby galaxy survey ( ngs ; * ? ? ?",
    "of the @xmath1 early - type galaxies in the sauron sample , @xmath20 are too close to uv - bright stars to be observed with _ galex _ and @xmath21 from our programmes have not been observed yet , similarly for @xmath22 galaxies from other guest investigator programmes , explaining the current sample of @xmath0 .",
    "the typical exposure time per field was one orbit ( @xmath23  s ) but occasionally more .",
    "details of the _ galex _ instruments , pipeline and calibration are described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we note in particular a possible systematic error in the fuv and nuv zero - points of up to @xmath24  mag .",
    "this is not included in the uncertainties quoted in the current paper as we are mostly interested in the relative colours of our objects .",

    "[ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , < \" , ]     for the first time , we present in figures  [ fig : fuvfp ] and [ fig : nuvfp ] the fundamental planes in the fuv and nuv bands , using again the same symbols as in figure  [ fig : cmrs ] .",
    "table  [ tab : fpresults ] lists the fp coefficients and scatter at both fuv and nuv , obtained from a least - square fit by minimizing the variations to the planes .",
    "fits including and excluding rsf galaxies are listed . as mentioned above ,",
    "rsf galaxies tend to have lower velocity dispersions and smaller effective radii and thus smaller masses than the bulk of the sample galaxies .",
    "crucially , rsf galaxies systematically deviate from the best - fit planes so as to create shallower slopes , and they significantly increase the scatters .",
    "this is clearly shown by both figures  [ fig : fuvfp ] and [ fig : nuvfp ] and the fp parameters listed in table  [ tab : fpresults ] .",
    "although our sample is limited , this indicates that lower mass galaxies , forming a larger amount of young stars , more greatly ( and systematically ) deviate from the plane defined by the quiescent galaxies .",
    "the long - wavelength @xmath28-band slope is less sensitive to contamination from young stellar populations than optical bands ( @xmath29 ; see @xcite ) .",
    "considering our nuv fundamental plane fit for the entire sample , our slope is significantly different from both the virial expectation and the @xmath28-band value .",
    "however , comparing our nuv - derived slope of @xmath30 for quiescent galaxies only , we recover all of the @xmath28-band slope and almost all of the tilt away from the virial expectation .",
    "we thus conclude that a significant fraction of the fp tilt and scatter is due to low - mass early - type galaxies with stellar populations significantly younger that those of high - mass galaxies , thus reducing their mass - to - light ratios .",
    "the fuv fundamental plane is more complicated to interpret because of the additional presence of old but hot stars ( uv upturn phenomenon ) , but a similar if weaker trend is observed .",
    "the tilt of the fundamental plane was also considered in @xcite using @xmath13-band photometry and sophisticated dynamical modeling .",
    "the main result to emerge was a clear , continuous and monotonic increase of the total dynamical mass - to - light ratio with velocity dispersion , consistent with the fp tilt .",
    "as can be seen here in figure  [ fig : cmrs2 ] , the nuv blue galaxies affecting the tilt of the uv fundamental planes also have some of the smallest velocity dispersions and lowest virial masses . furthermore ,",
    "although there is non - negligible scatter , clear ( nuv@xmath8)-@xmath31 and ( fuv@xmath3nuv)-@xmath31 ( or ( nuv@xmath8)-@xmath32 and ( fuv@xmath3nuv)-@xmath32 ) relations are observed . the current results thus seem entirely consistent with that of @xcite .",
    "we are simply picking up the galaxies with the largest and/or most recent star formation events here with our integrated nuv@xmath33 criterion .",
    "many studies have also exploited the projection of the fundamental plane onto the plane defined by @xmath34 and @xmath35 , i.e.  the kormendy relation @xcite . a clear advantage of this relation is that it is based on photometric parameters only , which are easily accessible even at high redshifts .",
    "all of our sample galaxies follow the kormendy relation , and we note that our uv kormendy relation slopes ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 at fuv and nuv , respectively , see figures  [ fig : fuvfp ] and [ fig : nuvfp ] ) are in rough agreement with the optical one ( @xmath38 in @xcite )",
    ". it may however be significant that , compared to the mean trends , rsf galaxies tend to be slightly offset toward smaller and/or fainter objects .",
    "we use the radial colour profiles to discuss the stellar populations of the sample galaxies .",
    "we discuss our criteria to classify them in groups exhibiting similar properties below , and then discuss in more detail galaxies with signs of recent star formation .",
    "first , our main tool are the nuv@xmath8 radial colour profiles . as for integrated magnitudes ,",
    "we classify a galaxy as having had recent star formation if its nuv@xmath8 profile is below @xmath39 for all or a significant portion of the radii probed .",
    "galaxies included in this category are ngc  474 , ngc  1023 , ngc  2974 , ngc  3032 , ngc  4150 , ngc  4459 , ngc  4526 , ngc  4550 and ngc  7457 .",
    "having said that , nuv@xmath3optical colours normally show negative slopes ( the central regions being redder ) due to variations in the properties of the underlying stellar populations , mainly age and metallicity .",
    "it is well - known that there is a significant age - metallicity degeneracy ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whereby it is difficult to distinguish the effects of a small change in age from those of a small change in metallicity .",
    "therefore , and even though we recognise the qualitative aspect of such a criterion , if only a small part  usually outside the effective radius  of the uv@xmath3optical colour profiles goes smoothly and only a little below the nuv@xmath40 cut , we consider it as having been caused by a simple metallicity gradient rather than residual star formation . in other words ,",
    "localised regions with nuv@xmath33 are only classified as recently star - forming if the changes in colour are abrupt .",
    "the galaxies exhibiting this behavior include ngc  821 , ngc  2699 , ngc  4546 , ngc  4570 , ngc  5308 , ngc  5813 , ngc  5831 and ngc  5845 .",
    "their integrated colours are all redder than the nuv@xmath40 colour threshold .",
    "second , we consider the fuv@xmath3nuv profiles . if a galaxy without evidence of recent star formation has a central region with fuv@xmath3nuv@xmath41 , we identify it as a uv - upturn galaxy .",
    "these galaxies include ngc  4374 , ngc  4486 , ngc  4552 , ngc4621 and ngc  5846 . as expected , these galaxies are among the most luminous and most massive in our sample .",
    "all except ngc  4621 are slow - rotators ( see @xcite ) .",
    "significantly , some uv - upturn galaxies have extreme fuv@xmath3nuv and fuv@xmath8 colours at small radii , bluer than the integrated aperture colours of classic uv - upturn galaxies dating from the _ international ultraviolet explorer _ ( _ iue _ ) era .",
    "as these galaxies provided important constraints on stellar evolutionary models of the uv - upturn , it will be interesting to revisit the models with the current data .",
    "it is also probably worthwhile to point out that a number of galaxies exhibit evidence for both a uv - upturn ( fuv@xmath3nuv@xmath41 in the centre ) and a substantial age or metallicity gradient ( nuv@xmath33 in the outer parts ) .",
    "these galaxies are ngc  2695 , ngc  4278 , ngc  4564 , ngc  5198 and ngc  5982 .",
    "they probably harbour milder forms of the uv - upturn phenomenon , where neither the uv - upturn nor large - scale stellar population gradients dominates .",
    "finally , we note that some galaxies exhibit no evidence for recent star formation or a uv - upturn , and no substantial large - scale age and/or metallicity gradient .",
    "these galaxies are ngc  524 , ngc  2768 , ngc  4387 , ngc  4458 , ngc  4473 , ngc  4477 and ngc  5838 .",
    "of the nine galaxies with convincing evidence for recent star formation , five ( ngc  474 , ngc  1023 , ngc  2974 , ngc  4459 and ngc  4526 ) show blue uv@xmath3optical colours in some regions only ( as opposed to all radii ) .",
    "interestingly , this appears connected to kinematic ( sub-)structures detected in sauron and other studies .",
    "the case of ngc  474 , known for its shells ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and strong misalignment between the kinematic and photometric major axes ( see @xcite ) , shows blue uv@xmath3optical colours and enhanced h@xmath5 line strength at large radii .",
    "ngc  1023 , with a prominent twist in the centre of the velocity map ( @xcite ) , reveals a uv blob on the eastern side of the galaxy and blue uv@xmath3optical colours in the same region , probably related to an interacting gas - rich dwarf galaxy ( see @xcite for hi observations ) .",
    "the presence of a uv - prominent outer ring related to a bar in ngc  2974 was discussed by @xcite .",
    "blue uv@xmath3optical colours in this galaxy are observed in the central and outer regions . in the case of ngc  4459 ,",
    "blue uv@xmath3optical colours are observed only in the centre .",
    "@xcite shows that this galaxy has strong h@xmath5 absorption within a central dust ring associated with a decoupled stellar and ionised gas disc ( @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "ngc  4526 is a similar object appearing more edge - on .",
    "both ngc  4459 and ngc  4526 also harbor central molecular gas discs @xcite .    on the other hand , of the nine galaxies with recent star formation , ngc  3032 , ngc  4150 , ngc  4550 and ngc  7457 show _ overall _ blue uv@xmath3optical colours .",
    "ngc  3032 shows the bluest uv@xmath3optical colour in our sample and has a prominent peak in the h@xmath5 map suggesting recent and ongoing star formation .",
    "@xcite identified two types of kinematically - decoupled components ( kdcs ) among the sauron sample : compact kdcs , which are often young and occur in fast - rotating galaxies , and kiloparsec - scale kdcs , with homogeneously old populations in slow - rotating galaxies ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "ngc  3032 , ngc  4150 and ngc  7457 all have small - scale kdcs ( @xcite ) and are considered fast rotators ( @xcite ) .",
    "ngc  3032 and ngc  4150 further have substantial molecular gas discs @xcite . in the case of ngc  4550 , with two counter - rotating stellar discs ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the h@xmath5 line strength is elevated in the central region along the major axis ( @xcite ) . its molecular gas content and detailed star formation history",
    "are discussed in @xcite .",
    "ngc  7457 has a controversial co detection discussed previously ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we have presented _ galex _ fuv and nuv imaging along with ground - based f555w imaging from the mdm observatory for @xmath0 early - type galaxies from the sauron survey sample .",
    "nine of them show extended blue uv@xmath3optical colours , hinting at recent star formation .",
    "five of these are also classified as rsf early - types by our integrated colour - magnitude relation criterion . supporting the findings from the uv colour - magnitude relation technique ,",
    "four out of the five candidate rsf galaxies also show enhanced h@xmath5 absorption line strengths , a widely - used post - starburst signature .",
    "the only exception ( ngc  474 ) is noted for its outer shells .",
    "roughly @xmath42  per cent of the early - type galaxies in our sample are therefore classified as rsf early types . considering that the uv flux from a starburst is only detectable for roughly @xmath10  gyr",
    ", this implies that residual star formation has been common in early - type galaxies even up to the present day .",
    "this star formation interpretation is also consistent with the results of molecular gas surveys , as the co detection rate is roughly @xmath43  per cent in rsf early - type galaxies , much higher than in quiescent systems .",
    "the velocity dispersions of these galaxies with evidence of recent star formation are among the lowest in the sample , and none has @xmath44  km  s@xmath7 , consistent with the independent work of @xcite .",
    "recent star formation early types also tend to have smaller effective radii and thus smaller ( virial ) masses . despite the limited number statistics ,",
    "a key result from the present study is that rsf early types change the slopes of scaling relations ( colour - magnitude relations and fundamental planes ) and dominate the scatters in them .",
    "most notably , much of the fp tilt and scatter can now be explained by the fact that the properties of a substantial fraction of early - type galaxies are influenced by rsf , systematically biasing their mass - to - light ratios , especially at low masses .",
    "the uv fundamental planes become significantly closer to the virial expectation ( and tighter ) when only quiescent early - type galaxies are considered .",
    "the same must be true at optical wavelengths , although the effect will be smaller .",
    "our result appears consistent with the m / l-@xmath31 relation derived in @xcite , although the current colour threshold only picks up the most extreme objects .",
    "the radial uv@xmath3optical colour profiles not only reveal recent star formation galaxies , but also a number of galaxies with smooth large - scale age and/or metallicity gradients .",
    "similarly , a number of galaxies exhibiting the uv - upturn phenomenon are identified .",
    "some have bluer fuv@xmath3nuv and fuv@xmath8 colours at small radii than the integrated aperture colours of classic uv - upturn galaxies .",
    "a number of galaxies show both a central uv - upturn and large - scale gradients .",
    "this diversity of behaviours will , in due time , need to be explained and reproduced by stellar population models .",
    "early - type galaxies are no longer thought to be simple .",
    "many of them have kinematic anomalies and sub - structures that are non - trivial to interpret .",
    "we have shown here that they are also composed of multiple generations of stars widely separated in age .",
    "this is consistently found by other short - wavelength as well as far - infrared studies , mainly aided by space experiments .",
    "the presence of young stars in seemingly old populations is no longer debatable , yet it is still unclear what causes and regulates this residual star formation .",
    "we believe that our database , spatially resolving nearby early - type galaxies , will be key to answering some of those questions .",

    "we discovered a strong nuv blob , constituting strong evidence for recent / ongoing star formation , just outside the galaxy .",

    "<S> we present _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( _ galex _ ) far ( fuv ) and near ( nuv ) ultraviolet imaging of @xmath0 nearby early - type galaxies from the sauron representative sample of @xmath1 e / s0 galaxies , all of which have ground - based optical imaging from the mdm observatory . </S>",
    "<S> the surface brightness profiles of nine galaxies ( @xmath2  per cent ) show regions with blue uv@xmath3optical colours suggesting recent star formation . </S>",
    "<S> five of these ( @xmath4  per cent ) show blue integrated uv@xmath3optical colours that set them aside in the nuv integrated colour - magnitude relation . </S>",
    "<S> these are objects with either exceptionally intense and localised nuv fluxes or blue uv@xmath3optical colours throughout . </S>",
    "<S> they also have other properties confirming they have had recent star formation , in particular h@xmath5 absorption higher than expected for a quiescent population and a higher co detection rate . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that residual star formation is more common in early - type galaxies than we are used to believe . </S>",
    "<S> nuv - blue galaxies are generally drawn from the lower stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath6  km  s@xmath7 ) and thus lower dynamical mass part of the sample . </S>",
    "<S> we have also constructed the first uv fundamental planes and show that nuv blue galaxies bias the slopes and increase the scatters . </S>",
    "<S> if they are eliminated the fits get closer to expectations from the virial theorem . </S>",
    "<S> although our analysis is based on a limited sample , it seems that a dominant fraction of the tilt and scatter of the uv fundamental planes is due to the presence of young stars in preferentially low - mass early - type galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the uv@xmath3optical radial colour profiles reveal a variety of behaviours , with many galaxies showing signs of recent star formation , a central uv - upturn phenomenon , smooth but large - scale age and metallicity gradients , and in many cases a combination of these . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , fuv@xmath3nuv and fuv@xmath8 colours even bluer than those normally associated with uv - upturn galaxies are observed at the centre of some quiescent galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> four out of the five uv - upturn galaxies are slow rotators . </S>",
    "<S> these objects should thus pose interesting challenges to stellar evolutionary models of the uv - upturn .    </S>",
