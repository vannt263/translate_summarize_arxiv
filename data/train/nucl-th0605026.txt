    "self - consistent mean - field models using effective interactions ( skyrme , gogny , etc ) have been applied to description of ground - state properties of nuclei with great success for a wide mass region@xcite .",
    "in addition , the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) is often utilized to take into account configuration mixing .",
    "however , the gcm requires us to choose generator coordinates with physical intuition and the coordinate is restricted to one dimension in most cases .",
    "thus , it is difficult to describe many kinds of low - lying excitations simultaneously . to overcome these difficulties",
    ", we attempt a new approach to select many slater determinants .",
    "we briefly discuss how to select slater determinants @xmath2 .",
    "we use the imaginary - time method which is a standard procedure for solving self - consistent hartree - fock equations .",
    "the energy expectation value of a slater determinant is lowered as the imaginary time evolves and finally converges to the energy minimum state .",
    "if the configuration approaches to a local minimum or a nearly stable quasi - minimum ( shoulder state ) , the state stays unchanged for a long period of time ( fig.[fig : itm ] ) .",
    "we would like to select slater determinants corresponding to these local minima and soft modes near the ground state .",
    "for this purpose , we start imaginary - time calculations from many initial slater determinants which are randomly generated , then pick up a state every 250 iterations of the imaginary - time step .",
    "since the state stays near local minima and the ground state for a long time , this prescription leads to a large probability of selecting states we want . repeating the same calculation with many initial states",
    ", we may select large number of slater determinants without assuming generator coordinates .",
    "we project each state on parity and angular momentum @xcite , then perform the configuration mixing calculation by solving the hill - wheeler - type equation @xcite .",

    "let us demonstrate that our method produces identical results for different initial sets of configurations generated by independent random numbers . in fig.[fig : energy ] , energy of @xmath3 states in @xmath4 are shown as increasing number of slater determinants .",
    "solid and dotted lines are independent calculations starting from different initial states .",
    "we see that the calculated energies of lowest four levels are almost identical in these two calculations .",
