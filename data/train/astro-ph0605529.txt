    "since the launch of the chandra x - ray observatory , it has become evident that x - ray emission is a common feature of jets in radio galaxies and quasars ( see , e.g. , @xcite for low - power radio galaxies , @xcite and @xcite for x - ray surveys of powerful radio galaxies and quasars , the overview articles by @xcite and @xcite for emission mechanisms , and the xjet home page for an up - to - date list of x - ray emission associated with extragalactic jets ) .",
    "typically , the x - ray emission from low - power jets ( @xcite [ fr ] class i ) fits on a single synchrotron spectrum with their radio and optical emission and is thus satisfactorily explained as synchrotron emission ( with the interesting problem of having to accelerate x - ray emitting synchrotron electrons _ in situ _ ) .",
    "however , the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of high - power ( fr ii ) jets usually shows the so - called `` bow - tie '' problem , i.e. , their x - ray spectrum does not fit on an extrapolation of the observed radio / optical synchrotron spectrum .",
    "a representative case in point is the first new x - ray jet detection by chandra , pks  0637 - 752 @xcite , with an observed cutoff to the synchrotron emission in the optical range , but a fairly hard x - ray spectrum . ]",
    "( @xmath0 ) and an x - ray flux per frequency decade ( i.e. , @xmath1 ) exceeding the optical one . as the predicted x - ray intensity from synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) emission",
    "is usually orders of magnitude below the observed one , it has been suggested that these jets are still highly relativistic at kiloparsec scales , with bulk lorentz factors in the range 530 and beyond , and that the x - rays are inverse - compton ( ic ) scattered cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons ( the beamed ic - cmb process ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the high lorentz factors are necessary in order for the energy density of the cmb photon field to be boosted sufficiently in the jet rest frame ( by a factor @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the _ bulk _ lorentz factor of the jet fluid ) to account for the observed x - ray : radio flux ratios .",
    "the beamed ic - cmb process is generally invoked to account for the x - ray emission from jets in which a single synchrotron component can not account for the emission in all wavebands .",
    "if correct , the inferred values of @xmath3 would constitute the first firm measurement of the velocity of high - power jets ( for the velocities of low - power jets , see the modeling by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with profound implications for the analysis of jet energetics and composition .",
    "since the increase of the cmb energy density with redshift would cancel the surface brightness dimming with redshift , beamed ic - cmb x - ray jets at high redshift could be cosmic beacons that outshine their quasars @xcite .",
    "moreover , there _ are _ jets in fr  ii radio galaxies and quasars whose x - ray emission is either well explained as synchrotron emission on an extrapolation of the radio - optical spectrum ( e.g. , in some of the jets in the survey by @xcite , and that in 3c403 [ @xcite ] ) , or because the necessary doppler factors can not be achieved from geometrical considerations , such as in pictor  a @xcite where there is x - ray emission from the counter - jet as well as the approaching jet . a detailed check of the beamed ic - cmb model is therefore warranted .",
    "there are two basic testable predictions of the beamed ic - cmb model which arise from the fact that those electrons responsible for the upscattering of cmb photons into the x - ray band have low lorentz factors ( @xmath4 ) and hence emit synchrotron radiation at wavelengths of a few tens or hundreds of megahertz , below the typical gigahertz - range observing frequencies allowing high - resolution studies of radio jets .",
    "essentially , a similar part of the electron energy distribution can be observed in two different wavebands ( the electrons producing ic emission in the chandra band emit synchrotron radiation in the range 40hz1mhz ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , leading us to expect a close correspondence both of morphology and of spectral index between a beamed ic - cmb jet s x - ray and radio emission .    we have chosen the jet in 3c273 for a detailed test of the beamed ic - cmb model with the chandra x - ray observatory .",
    "this jet has a unique combination of properties that make it worthy of detailed study : it has a large angular size ( bright radio , optical and x - ray emission being observed from 11  out to 22  from the core ) , it is one of the closest high - power jets ( @xmath5 ) so that smaller physical scales and @xmath6 , leading to a scale of @xmath7 per second of arc at 3c273 s redshift of 0.158 .",
    "] can be resolved than in most similar jets , and high - resolution vla and hst data are available ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) that allow the construction of detailed seds and the study of the relation between the jet s x - rays and the radio - optical synchrotron emission .",
    "3c273 s jet is among those from which x - ray emission had been detected already with the _ einstein _ satellite @xcite .",
    "based on a comparison of rosat hri observations with radio and optical data , @xcite concluded that the x - ray emission could only be due to the same synchrotron component as the jet s radio - optical emission in the first bright feature of the jet ( `` knot  a '' ) , but not in the remainder of the jet , where there is a cutoff to the synchrotron component in the near - infrared / optical range ; later , @xcite and @xcite showed that at 03 resolution , already the radio - optical seds of most of the jet , including knot  a , require a two - component model to account for the emission .",
    "hence , the x - ray emission there can not be due to a single radio ",
    "optical  x - ray synchrotron component , either ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "* who suggests that an additional contribution of synchrotron emission from particles moving in fields that are tangled on small scales may explain the observed flattening , at least in parts of the jet ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that the second optical component may be the same component as the jet s x - ray emission , but could not constrain the emission mechanism for the high - energy component further .",
    "regarding the x - ray emission mechanism , @xcite ruled out ssc as well as thermal bremsstrahlung .",
    "the first chandra observations of this jet were presented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented the first x - ray image of this jet with both high resolution and high signal - to - noise ratio . regarding the seds , they came to similar conclusions as @xcite .",
    "@xcite had analyzed a smaller set of the early chandra data and favored a beamed ic - cmb model for the emission from all parts of the jet .",
    "@xcite compared the optical and x - ray morphology at the chandra resolution of 078 and found that the x - ray and optical emission come from the same parts of the jet and show very similar features . however , there are offsets between the x - ray and optical peaks in one or both of the first two bright knots . in the remainder of the jet ,",
    "the relative variations in x - ray brightness are smaller than those in the radio and optical . such size and",
    "brightness differences require some parameter fine - tuning in the ic - cmb model .",
    "thus , previous observations had left the nature of the x - ray emission mechanism of 3c273 unclear .",
    "here , we present a spectral analysis of our new chandra observations , which we combine with archival data and our vla + hst dataset from @xcite .",
    "observations and data reduction are described in  [ s : obs ] , our spectral analysis and its results are presented in  [ s : analysis ] , and we discuss in  [ s : discussion ] the implications of our results for the beamed ic - cmb model and other emission mechanisms .",
    "we summarize our findings in  [ s : conc ] .",
    "we have obtained four observations of 3c273 and its jet in chandra observing cycle 5 , totaling just under 160  ksec observing time .",
    "the observations were split into four exposures of equal length in order to search for variability within the observing cycle .",
    "the quasar and jet were placed on the acis - s3 chip in each of these .",
    "we also use calibration observations of 3c273 from the chandra archive : two acis - s3 data sets from cycle  1 , with 30  ksec exposure time each , and seven acis+hetg calibration observations , totaling just under 200  ksec .",
    "the gratings only transmit about 10% of the soft x - ray photons ( @xmath8kev ) , but about 75% of the hard x - ray photons ( @xmath9kev ) .",
    "hence , we use the grating data to perform consistency checks on the spectral shape of the jet at the high - energy end of the chandra bandpass .",
    "we will not use them for morphological analysis .",
    "this decision is based purely on the fact that their inclusion would have required substantial additional effort without a commensurate gain in the total number of detected photons ; as the calibration data were used by the calibration team to check the effective area , not the pileup or contamination correction , they could be used without causing any circular reasoning .",

    "* section 6.14 ) even with a frame time of 0.4s ( chosen in our new observations ) or with the hetg in place .",

    "we average the individual measurements to get a final quasar position in `` physical '' acis coordinates .",
    "we then update the world coordinate system ( wcs ) of the individual event files and maps to assign 3c273 s right ascension and declination as determined from radio observations to the quasar s fitted physical coordinates .",
    "for the hetg zeroth - order images , which are used for consistency checks , we fit a gaussian to the wings of the quasar image to fix the astrometry relative to the quasar core .",
    "we perform a separate spectral analysis in each of nine regions , which we have defined considering both the radio / optical and x - ray morphology .",

    "* their table 4 ) ; later , @xcite and thence @xcite used different subdivisions .",
    "there are no gaps between the extraction regions , and each is about 1 - 2  in size .",
    "while the jet shows similar morphology at all wavelengths , there are differences in some places , which create some ambiguity as to where the boundaries between different jet regions ( or knots ) should be placed .",
    "the differences in morphology at different wavelengths imply spatial variations in the spectral shape .",
    "hence , some of our measurement regions mix emission from jet features with different spectral shapes .",
    "given that the chandra resolution of 078 ( full - width at half - maximum intensity of a gaussian fitted to the readout streak ) is comparable to the typical diameter of the jet features , such mixing of spectral shapes can not be avoided entirely .",
    "however , the morphology differences are mostly minor , the sole exception being region b1 , in which the x - ray and optical emission clearly arch to the north , while the radio emission has an arc to the south ( compare * ? ? ?",
    "this difference may in fact contain a crucial hint to the nature of the emission and particle acceleration mechanism acting in the jet ; however , the two arcs are not fully resolved by chandra , so that we include both in a single region .",
    "still , the need to consider the emission from the arcs in b1 separately should be borne in mind when analyzing the spectral shape there .",
    "for the estimation of the background count rate , we define annuli of similar radial extent as the corresponding jet region that are centered on the quasar , as large - angle scattered photons from the quasar core are the dominant contribution to the background .",
    "the background regions exclude the jet regions themselves as well as the readout streak .    considering the locations of those events classified",
    "as `` afterglow events '' by the ciao pipeline suggests that obsids 1711 and 1712 include some piled - up events at the brightness peak of region a. the other acis - s3 observations used a 1/8th subarray , shortening the frame time correspondingly , and therefore do not suffer from pileup .",
    "the hetg observations have lower count rates in the jet and pileup is much less than 1% there .    to determine the flux and x - ray spectral index , we extract spectra and response files for each source region using the ` psextract ` ciao script .",
    "we searched for variability in the count rates of each of the regions over all six acis - s3 data sets and found no variations in excess of the expected poisson fluctuations for a constant count rate .",

    "compared to positing that the x - rays from jets in fr  ii sources are due to synchrotron emission , the single - zone beamed ic - cmb model seemed to be more conforming to occam s razor , since it only needed the assumption that the bulk lorentz factors inferred for parsec - scale jets from vlbi observations of blazars persist on the kiloparsec scale . by comparison",

    "based on high - resolution observations and a physical model of the jet flow , the presense of velocity shear has been established in a number of low - power jets : those in the radio galaxies 3c31 @xcite , b2  0326 + 39 and b2  1553 + 24 @xcite and ngc 315 @xcite .",
    "a `` spine - sheath '' shear structure has also been implied for low - power jets based on beaming statistics of fr  i and bl  lacs in the b2 survey @xcite , as well as from polarimetric observations of the jet in m87 @xcite .",
    "however , both theoretical considerations @xcite and the analogy between accretion in agn and black hole x - ray binaries @xcite may lead us to expect that the velocity structure of high - power jets is different from that of low - power jets ( see the discussion in  7 of * ? ? ?",
    "while the polarization properties of some jets in fr  iis show a spine - sheath structure @xcite that may suggest a similar velocity structure as in fr  is , @xcite have pointed out that the polarization structure may be caused by the magnetic field structure rather than a velocity gradient .",
    "thus , even though such a structure has not yet been firmly established , it would not be implausible for fr  ii jets to have a spine - sheath structure , warranting its consideration here .    in a two - zone beamed ic - cmb model for 3c273 , the highly relativistic part of the flow ( the `` spine '' ) would account for the bulk of the x - ray emission , while the slower part of the flow ( the `` sheath '' ) would dominate the synchrotron emission ( fig .",
    "[ f : twozone ] a ) .",
    "thus , the observed radio spectral index of the jet is that of the sheath , with @xmath29 . to match the observed x - ray spectral index ,",
    "the fast spine would need to have a synchrotron spectrum with @xmath30 . to keep the observed radio spectral index unchanged",
    ", the spine would also need to have a much lower radio luminosity .",

    "instead , the spine has to have a much lower radio brightness than the sheath .",
    "if the spine has an ( observer - frame ) flux density at 1.6ghz of 10% of that of the sheath , its steeper - spectrum contribution would not change the total spectral index between 1.6ghz and 330mhz by more than 0.05 , i.e. , within the spectral index errors .",
    "hence , we consider a 10% contribution at 1.6ghz the maximum plausible flux density of the spine that would keep it undetectable as a separate steep - spectrum component .

    "the x - ray emission has to be produced in the spine via upscattering of cmb photons by an electron distribution that would contribute only about 1% of the jet s total synchrotron luminosity ( where the latter is inferred from the radio flux ) . we just estimated that the spine could contribute at most 10% of the radio flux density at 1.6ghz ; by extrapolating the x - ray flux density to 1.6ghz using the observed spectral index , we obtain that the x - ray : radio ratio for the spine ( @xmath31 in the notation of * ? ? ?",

    "if this was the case , the boosted cmb would need to contribute only half of the seed - photon energy density .",
    "as the boosted cmb energy density scales like @xmath2 , the required bulk lorentz factor would be reduced only by about @xmath46 . at the same time",
    ", the sheath electrons will upscatter seed photons from the spine , creating an additional ic component . in the case of 3c273",
    ", the dominant contribution to the synchrotron luminosity would arise in the sheath (  layer  in the terminology of * ? ? ? * ) rather than the spine as assumed for the blazars considered by @xcite .",
    "this additional `` mutual - compton '' ( mc ) scattering will produce detailed seds that are quite different from those arising in a one - zone synchrotron + beamed ic - cmb model .",
    "as noted by @xcite , the mc scattering could cause a deceleration of the spine ( an `` inverse compton - rocket '' effect ) .",
    "this might provide a more natural explanation for the deceleration that is necessary to account for the changing x - ray : radio ratios along some extragalactic jets , including 3c273 s ( see @xcite and in particular @xcite for the deceleration of this jet implied by a one - zone beamed - ic model ) .",
    "the fr  i flow modeling by @xcite shows that these jets decollimate as they decelerate , presumably by entrainment , while no sign of decollimation is observed in 3c273 and other high - power jets .",
    "however , as noted by @xcite , the large number of free parameters of this kind of two - zone model makes it very difficult to obtain definite predictions for the expected shape of the sed .",
    "the most stringent observational constraints will be imposed by verifying whether or not the radio spectrum shows any signs of the steeper - spectrum component assumed to arise in the spine at lower frequencies than observed so far , e.g. , in the frequency range around 100mhz that will soon be accessible with the low - frequency array ( lofar ) . in any case",
    ", the two - zone ic - cmb model requires that the `` spine - sheath '' jet should develop very different low - energy electron populations in the different parts of the flow .",
    "this may seem somewhat artificial if the velocity structure arises from simple velocity shear , unless the shape of the electron energy distribution in jets is governed entirely by a distributed acceleration mechanism , rather than by shock acceleration in the innermost part of the jet ( compare the discussion of  shock - like  versus  jet - like  acceleration in * ? ? ?",
    "the different energy distributions might arise more naturally if the two - zone flow existed from the outset ( e.g. , as in the model by * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a detailed parameter study is necessary to explore the range of plausible total seds ( including synchrotron emission , beamed ic - cmb , and mc scattering ) ; this is beyond the scope of this paper .

    "however , the limit to the width of the brightness peaks in knots  a and b2 is smaller than the measured sizes in the optical and radio bands @xcite , where they are clearly resolved @xcite .",
    "this is incompatible with the beamed ic - cmb model  even in a decelerating one - zone flow such as that considered by @xcite , the optical emission should be the most concentrated because the `` optical synchrotron '' electrons have the shortest synchrotron loss scales . thus , even though the sed of knot  a admits a one - zone ic - cmb model , its morphology does not .",
    "in general , the presence of unresolved knot emission superimposed on resolved more diffuse jet emission compels us to consider two - zone models ( although not necessarily only spine - sheath models ) .    in summary ,",
    "if fr  ii jets have a spine - sheath structure , and the spine is highly relativistic , there will naturally be two zones in the jet with different ic - cmb emission .",
    "the `` mutual - compton '' scattering of the radiation from the one zone by electrons in the other might provide a natural explanation for the apparent deceleration of 3c273 implied by the changing x - ray : radio ratio @xcite .",
    "however , a two - zone ic - cmb model appears to require unrealistically large bulk lorentz factors for the spine of the jet , of order 50100 .",
    "moreover , the two - zone ic - cmb model does not intuitively explain why the emission in the x - ray band has a softer spectrum than that in the radio band .",
    "as pointed out above , a one - zone synchrotron model is already excluded by the spectral hardening in the near - infrared / optical / uv region .",
    "hence , we only discuss a two - zone synchrotron model here .",
    "the evidence in favor of a spine - sheath structure in fr  ii jets summarized in ",
    "[ s : disc.ic.twozone ] is of course equally relevant to the discussion of a two - zone synchrotron model .    in a two - zone synchrotron model",
    ", there would be the same need to account for these different electron energy distributions , but the difference would now be between the _ low_-energy electron distribution of one zone ( emitting at radio wavelengths ) and the _ high_-energy electron distribution of the other one ( producing x - rays ) .",
    "it is already known that many low - power jets emit synchrotron x - rays @xcite , and possibly _ all _ such jets do @xcite .",
    "the extremely short synchrotron loss timescales of 10s of years for the x - ray emitting electrons require an _ in - situ _ acceleration process to generate these electrons .",
    "it would then be an obvious assumption that high - power jets are also able to accelerate such electrons .",
    "indeed , some high - power jets show evidence for synchrotron x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite have all argued that efficient particle acceleration is possible in regions of velocity shear .",
    "* thus , particle acceleration in a sheared region of the flow might provide a direct physical link between a two - zone velocity structure and a two - component synchrotron spectrum , since an additional acceleration mechanism would be available in the sheared part of the flow .",
    "* we stress that the presence of shear acceleration does not preclude the possibility that there is another distributed acceleration mechanism acting in the other , or both , fluid zones , e.g. , one related to the dissipation of magnetic fields @xcite    in the context of such a model , the soft x - ray spectrum in 3c273 with @xmath47 for regions  b2 and beyond could be caused either by a soft energy spectrum being generated by the distributed acceleration process , or because it arises from a loss - dominated part of the energy distribution .",
    "the difference in x - ray spectral index between the first bright knot  a and the faint bridge b1 on the one hand , and the second bright knot b2 and beyond on the other hand , would require at least some difference of the physical parameters ( either by producing a different electron energy distribution , or by producing stronger cooling ) , and perhaps even a different acceleration mechanism acting there .",
    "this physical difference might have been expected given that a is the first bright region of the optical and x - ray jet , after a gap of 12  with only very faint optical @xcite and x - ray @xcite emission .",
    "the difference between a and b2 may well be related to the reason for the jet lighting up at a. we will revisit the emission from the inner part of the jet in a forthcoming paper on the x - ray morphology .    in figure",
    "[ f : colorjet ] , we give a summary of the energetically dominant wavebands and the associated spatial component and emission mechanism , both for the two - zone inverse - compton and the synchrotron model .",
    "we have presented new deep chandra acis - s3 observations of the jet in 3c273 and analyzed them in conjunction with archival data , concentrating on the shape of the radio / optical / x - ray sed in this paper .",
    "fitting power laws to the radio and x - ray spectra , we find that a single - zone beamed ic - cmb model for the x - ray emission is viable only in regions  a and b1 ; in the remainder of the jet , the x - ray spectra are softer than the radio spectra .",
    "this is in contrast with the similarly well - studied x - ray jets of pks0637@xmath13752 , 1136@xmath13135 , and 1150@xmath48497 , where the radio and x - ray slopes are compatible with each other in all parts of the jet where both have been measured @xcite .",
    "thus , most of the x - ray emission from the jet in 3c273 must be due to a different emission process than compton scattering of cmb photons by the same electrons producing the bulk of the synchrotron radio emission .",
    "a single - zone synchrotron model extending from radio to x - rays had already been ruled out for all parts of the jet based on previous observations @xcite . a two - zone beamed ic - cmb model does not seem capable of accounting for the x - ray emission from 3c273 s jet with any fewer assumptions than a two - zone synchrotron model .",
    "a two - zone ic - cmb model may still be viable , but would require extreme bulk lorentz factors to produce the observed x - ray emission from much fewer electrons than inferred from the jet s total radio synchrotron emission .",
    "in addition , there is no intuitive explanation for obtaining different electron energy distributions in the spine and the sheath .",
    "by contrast , a two - zone synchrotron model , in which a distributed particle acceleration mechanism related to velocity shear is producing the x - ray emitting particles , provides a causal relationship between the difference in fluid velocities and the different spectral properties .",
    "there would still be velocity and hence beaming differences between the two zones , but they would not have to be as extreme as in the two - zone ic - cmb models , and therefore one might hope to obtain better - constrained parameters for the two zones , and hence falsifiable predictions of this model .",
    "an x - ray polarimeter would enable significant progress to be made in this question ; also , the mid - infrared wavelength region that has now been made accessible by the spitzer space telescope will be of great importance , as shown by the analysis of this jet s mid - infrared emission by @xcite",
    ".    it would clearly be desirable to test the consistency of the radio and x - ray spectral indices with the one - zone beamed ic - cmb model for more jets in the future .",

    "this will allow more tests of both emission models for the x - rays .",
