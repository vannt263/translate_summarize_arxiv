    "it reduces to conventional bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory @xcite in the thermodynamic ( td ) limit .",
    "the model has a pseudo - spin representation with @xmath16 ( see methods ) with @xmath17 spins .",
    "central to our approach is the fact that this hamiltonian can be diagonalized using the bethe ansatz @xcite .",
    "the hilbert space separates into sectors of fixed number of down spins @xmath18 .",
    "the eigenstates of the model are given by bethe wavefunctions , each individually characterized by a set of @xmath18 rapidities @xmath19 obeying a set of algebraic equations known as the richardson equations 1g=_=1^n1w_j - _",

    "[ richwf ] the @xmath22 different solutions to ( [ richeq ] ) then allow to construct a full set of orthogonal eigenstates , providing us with a proper basis of the hilbert space .    in bethe ansatz solvable models ,",
    "slavnov s formula @xcite , gives the overlap of an eigenstate @xmath23 with a general bethe state @xmath24 ( see methods ) .",
    "the main difference with other models solvable by algebraic bethe ansatz ( like the one - dimensional bose gas or the xxz chain ) is that in the definition of the eigenstates ( [ richwf ] ) , the coupling constant @xmath4 enters only implicitly through the solutions of the richardson equation for @xmath25 .",
    "consequently , for this model , slavnov s formula is enough to calculate the overlaps between two generic states at any coupling . for other models , where @xmath20 depends explicitely on @xmath4",
    ", it can only be used between states defined by the same operators @xmath20 and therefore the same @xmath4 , and a more general expression for the overlaps remains to be found .",
    "we can then exploit the accessibility to the quench matrix for the richardson model to show how useful integrability can be when studying quenches .",
    "however , before entering in the details of the quantum dynamics , it is important to remember that in the td limit @xmath26 at fixed filling , the dynamics becomes classical @xcite because of suppression of quantum fluctuations . in this limit , the dynamics of the canonical order parameter can be obtained analytically by exploiting classical integrability @xcite .",
    "the framework we propose in this letter works in the mesoscopic regime ( finite @xmath17 ) , allowing to study the effects of quantum fluctuations . with this tool at hand",
    ", we can characterize in an exact manner the crossover taking place between microscopic and macroscopic physics , a task impossible to achieve with thermodynamical approaches .",
    "we will argue in the following that , similarly to what is observed for equilibrium correlation functions , only a relatively small set of states contributes significantly to the decomposition of the initial state in the new eigenbasis .",
    "the natural approach is then to truncate in an optimal way the hilbert space , so that a faithful representation of the initial state is obtained .",
    "the induced truncation error is easily evaluated looking at how close @xmath27 is to the desired value of @xmath28 . using the truncated hilbert space we can then calculate any observable or correlation function by brute force summing the relevant contributions .",
    "compared to other numerical truncation methods , this approach has the great advantage that time enters only as a parameter .",
    "the explicit expression ( [ psi_of_t ] ) for the wavefunction means that at any time , expectation values can be computed without knowing the previous history of the system ( apart from the initial state ) and there is therefore no accumulation of errors as time passes . on the other hand , compared to numerical exact diagonalization , matrix elements can be expressed using slavnov s formula as matrix determinants whose computational complexity is algebraic and not exponential in the system size and/or number of excitations , thereby allowing to reach large system sizes .",

    "ground state , the top inset shows the overlaps with all the states at three different finite couplings .",
    "this allows to understand some general features : having access to the complete quench matrix , one realizes that only a few of the eigenstates at coupling @xmath4 have a large contribution to @xmath36 . therefore ,",
    "getting a nearly exact description of the dynamics requires only a small subset of the states .",
    "the final state having the largest overlap with the initial ground state is always one of the states that at @xmath29 is built by flipping from up ( down ) to down ( up ) the @xmath37 spins right below ( above ) the fermi level .",

    "the total contribution of single block states is non - monotonic in @xmath4 showing ( after decline at small interaction ) a rise as @xmath4 gets sufficiently large .",
    "the ` band - like ' structure of the overlaps in fig . [ quenchmat ] makes it reasonable to assume that additional large contributions can be found for states built by slightly deforming the single block ones , e.g. by adding a single particle - hole excitation either above or below the fermi level .",
    "the remaining most relevant states will then be those with two additional excitations . following this assumption inductively , we add to the truncated hilbert space multiple block states obtained by slightly deforming single block ones .",
    "this allows us to describe larger systems while retaining a tractable number of states .",
    "this procedure works extremely well , e.g. at @xmath40 , for all the quenches from @xmath41 to @xmath42 $ ] , we were always able to find at minimum @xmath43 of the weight of the initial state by using only 7000 states , i.e. only @xmath44 of the full hilbert space .",
    "moreover , for a given final value of @xmath4 , less than a 1000 of these states gives an actual important contribution .",
    "in the center of fig . [ quenchmat ] , we report the overlaps obtained by quenching from different initial values of @xmath2 to the same final @xmath32 .",
    "we see that the same band - like structure is present as when starting from a non - interacting state , leading to no qualitative change of the dynamics .",
    "vice - versa , the structure of the quench matrix for a reversed quench , i.e. from large to small @xmath4 , reported in the bottom of fig .",
    "[ quenchmat ] is different : the weight of the state goes down exponentially with the energy of the states ( almost straight lines in the figure ) , and for large quenches the decay rate in energy is slow .",
    "an adequate representation of the initial state therefore requires that lots of states be taken into account . in this case , the optimal truncation procedure is still easily defined by simply keeping a sufficient number of low energy states .    .",

    "we show @xmath50 at different @xmath17 keeping @xmath45 fixed .",

    "[ quenchmat ] , for finite large couplings , the low energy bands are already clearly formed , progressively collapsing into a single energy @xmath60 .",

    "<S> understanding the non - equilibrium dynamics of extended quantum systems after the trigger of a sudden , global perturbation ( quench ) represents a daunting challenge , especially in the presence of interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the main difficulties stem from both the vanishing time scale of the quench event , which can thus create arbitrarily high energy modes , and its non - local nature , which curtails the utility of local excitation bases . </S>",
    "<S> we here show that nonperturbative methods based on integrability can prove sufficiently powerful to completely characterize quantum quenches : we illustrate this using a model of fermions with pairing interactions ( richardson s model ) . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of simple ( and multiple ) quenches on the dynamics of various important observables are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> many of the features we find are expected to be universal to all kinds of quench situations in atomic physics and condensed matter .    </S>",
    "<S> the experimental realization @xcite of cold atomic systems with a high degree of tunability of hamiltonian parameters , and the ability to evolve in time with negligible dissipation , has reignited the study of many - body quantum systems away from equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> how gibbs or any other relaxed states can ultimately result from unitary dynamics is a question that has received a lot of attention recently @xcite , but which still lacks a general understanding .    </S>",
    "<S> suppose an extended quantum system is prepared in one eigenstate @xmath0 of some hamiltonian @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a tunable , global parameter ( interaction strength , external field , ... ) . </S>",
    "<S> at a given time , say @xmath3 , this parameter is suddenly changed to a different value @xmath4 , and the system thus starts evolving _ unitarily _ according to the dynamics governed by a different hamiltonian @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this is what is referred to as a quantum quench . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting time evolution is simply given by the solution of the schrdinger equation @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath7 is _ not _ an eigenstate of @xmath5 , this can be extremely difficult to quantify . the most straightforward way to tackle </S>",
    "<S> the problem is therefore to write the initial state @xmath0 as a sum over the complete set of eigenstates @xmath8 ( having energy @xmath9 ) of hamiltonian @xmath5 , leading to the time - dependent post - quench state |(t)= _ e^-i_g^t _ g^|_g_0^|_g^. [ psi_of_t ] the complexity of the problem is encoded first in the distribution of energies @xmath10 , but most importantly in the matrix of overlaps of eigenstates pertaining to the two different hamiltonians , q_g g_0^ , [ quenchmatrix ] which we call the _ </S>",
    "<S> quench matrix_. this matrix is of dimension equal to that of the hilbert space , , and is well - defined provided we adopt a proper measure for the scalar product . ] </S>",
    "<S> but in practice we mainly need a single column expressing the initial eigenstate of @xmath1 in terms of the eigenstates of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> however , even in the very few cases when all eigenstates of a many - body hamiltonian can be classified and written down , the calculation of the quench matrix coefficients is a severe challenge , whose computational complexity generally grows factorially with system size . </S>",
    "<S> shortcuts can be found for systems having a representation in terms of free particles ( like the 1d ising chains @xcite ) where wick s theorem suffices to calculate all the overlaps , but for truly interacting systems this remains a very ambitious programme . </S>",
    "<S> most of the theoretical work on quantum quenches has up to now concentrated on the calculation of correlation functions in specific regimes @xcite , with little reference to the post - quench state of the system .    besides describing the state resulting from a quench of state @xmath11 , it is also important to be able to characterize the time dependence of physical observables @xmath12 after the quench . formally , we can write & & ( t ) | o | ( t ) + & = & _ , e^i ( _ g^-_g^ ) t q_g_0 g^ q_g g_0^ < ^_g |o| ^_g > , [ quencho ] where calculating the matrix elements @xmath13 represents an additional hurdle for interesting observables in nontrivially interacting models . even if we are able to obtain these matrix elements , the leftover double sum over the full hilbert space is enormous , and one can wonder whether this way of proceeding is of any practical use . </S>",
    "<S> new nonperturbative methods are clearly needed to obtain a proper description of the physics involved .    </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of the present paper is to introduce a new line of attack on quantum quench problems , sufficiently powerful to yield not only the quench matrix of specific interacting problems ( and thus the ensuing nonequilibrium state ) , but also able to provide matrix elements of physical observables , and thus their time dependence after the quench . </S>",
    "<S> this approach is based on the exact solvability of certain many - body quantum problems known as integrable or bethe ansatz @xcite solvable theories . </S>",
    "<S> integrability came into prominence as a means of obtaining exact results for the equilibrium thermodynamics of one - dimensional systems ( see @xcite and references therein ) . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , a description of correlation functions at equilibrium has been achieved by exploiting results from the algebraic bethe ansatz ( aba ) , which provides economical expressions for matrix elements of local operators in the basis of exact bethe eigenstates . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of these expressions stems from two results : slavnov s formula @xcite for the overlap of a bethe state with a generic state , and the solution of the so - called quantum inverse problem @xcite , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ the mapping of physical operators to aba operators . </S>",
    "<S> these matrix elements are of great utility in the computation of equilibrium correlation functions . </S>",
    "<S> one very important feature is that bethe states typically offer a very optimized basis in which only a very small minority of eigenstates carry substantial correlation weight , allowing the summation over intermediate states to be drastically truncated without significantly affecting the results . </S>",
    "<S> this novel approach has been successfully applied to equilibrium correlations of quantum spin chains @xcite and atomic bose gases @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we here further extend the reach of integrability into the domain of non - equilibrium quench dynamics . </S>"
