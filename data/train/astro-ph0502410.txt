    "the multiple outburst episode of v838 mon in early 2002 has been well documented @xcite .",
    "the object was first detected in outburst on 2002 january 6 ( @xmath1 ) @xcite , and subsequent outbursts developed in 2002 february ( @xmath2 ) and 2002 march ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "optical spectroscopy showed a cool , reddened object , whose continuum shape and absorption spectrum were broadly consistent with those of a k supergiant .",
    "however , many of the spectral lines displayed p cygni profiles , indicating outflow speeds of @xmath4200 , and exhibited strong variability .",
    "the post - eruption phase was characterised by a dramatic increase in @xmath5 , accompanied by a rapid trend towards later spectral types . as of 2002",
    "may the visual magnitude had faded by @xmath6 mag since the 2002 march peak , and the effective temperature was 2400  k @xcite . by 2002 september",
    "further bolometric fading had revealed the presence of a possible b3  v companion @xcite . at this time",
    "the near - infrared spectrum of v838 mon displayed very deep h@xmath7o , co , tio , vo and alo bands , and superficially resembled l - type brown dwarfs , indicating a very cool giant / supergiant @xcite .",
    "v838 mon may not be a unique object .",
    "the similarities with v4332 sgr and m31  rv are broad - based @xcite , and a further analogue may be found in the `` peculiar variable in crux '' @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite presented a near - infrared spectrum of v4332 sgr , which also displayed strong alo bands , but in emission .",
    "accretion models involving stellar mergers @xcite and planets @xcite have been proposed to collectively explain this group of unusual objects .    here",
    "we present some of our latest observations of the near - infrared monitoring program of v838 mon , emphasizing the discovery of sio overtone emission and inverse p - cygni profiles on some atomic lines .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     low and high resolution infrared spectroscopy of v838 mon were obtained on numerous occasions between late 2002 and end 2003 , using the facility instrument cgs4 @xcite on the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) .",
    "an observing log for the specific observations presented here from that time interval is provided in table  [ log ] ; additional spectra obtained during that period will be reported later .",
    "the observations employed the cgs4 40  l / mm and echelle gratings at resolving powers of @xmath41400 and 20,000 respectively . flux calibration and removal of telluric absorption features were achieved by dividing the target spectra by spectra of nearby calibration stars . to avoid spurious emission lines in the ratioed spectra due to hydrogen absorption lines in the calibration stars ,",
    "the pa@xmath0 , pf@xmath8 and br@xmath9 lines were removed from the calibration stars by interpolation prior to ratioing .",
    "the low resolution ratioed spectra were then multiplied by a blackbody corresponding to the effective temperature and broadband photometric magnitudes of the standard star to give the final flux - calibrated spectra .",
    "the high resolution spectra were scaled to make the continuum equal to unity after division . at low resolution ,",
    "wavelength calibration was carried out by obtaining argon lamp spectra immediately before the target and is accurate to better than 0.001  @xmath10 m .",
    "argon lines also were used to calibrate the echelle spectrum at 1.28  @xmath10 m , but telluric n@xmath7o absorption lines in the spectrum of the calibration star were used to calibrate the 4  @xmath10 m echelle spectra , in both cases to an accuracy of @xmath113 .",
    "the spectral evolution of v838 mon ( 2002 december@xmath122003 october ) in the range 2.94.1  @xmath10 m is shown in figure  [ lband ] .",
    "the bulk of the detail in the 2.93.5  @xmath10 m region is due to a combination of the @xmath13 and @xmath14 stretching bands of h@xmath7o .",
    "we have observed strong water bands in v838 mon previously in @xmath15 spectroscopy , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the oh fundamental ( @xmath16 ) @xmath17 branch lines straddle this wavelength range in late - type , o - rich stars .",
    "the line positions of the @xmath18 band , obtained from @xcite are indicated in the figure .",
    "the line strengths are usually slowly varying across the band , as the excitation energy varies slowly as a function of @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath20 lines are the only oh lines present in the spectra and their intensities clearly fade over the period of our observations .",
    "the lack of higher excitation oh emission lines can be ascribed to temperature , but it is difficult to account for features at lower @xmath19 unless oh absorption , increasing towards lower @xmath19 , is also present .",
    "higher resolution observations might reveal such absorption .",
    "oh transitions involving higher vibrational states do not appear to contribute significantly in this wavelength range .",
    "the sio first overtone ( @xmath21 ) is conspicuous in the @xmath22 m region in emission , as was reported by @xcite . in all of our spectra",
    "the @xmath23 band is clearly visible , but there is little or no evidence for the @xmath24 bandhead .",
    "therefore only the lowest vibrational states @xmath25 are significantly populated .    to produce a significant population in the @xmath26 level by collisional excitation from @xmath27",
    "the density must be @xmath28a@xmath29/c@xmath30 , where a@xmath29 is the einstein coefficient for spontaneous decay from @xmath27 to @xmath31 .",
    "for sio - h@xmath32 collisions we can estimate the rate constant c@xmath30 for collisional excitation from the @xmath27 to the @xmath26 level using the vibrational relaxation time formula given in @xcite . assuming , as is usual @xcite , the de - excitation cross sections scale like the radiative matrix elements , and using detailed balance , we obtain c@xmath33  @xmath34 .",
    "the required density is then @xmath35  @xmath34 at the excitation temperature of the sio ( see below ) .",
    "this will be an overestimate if there is a significant fractional amount of atomic hydrogen ( @xmath36 ) , since laboratory experiments with co show that the rate coefficents for collisions with h are @xmath37 times larger than those involving h@xmath32 ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "( 12.0,8 ) ( -0.3,-4.0 )    ( -0.3,-4.0 )    figure  [ highressio ] shows a later spectrum at high resolution in the spectral range 3.984.05  @xmath10 m .",
    "this covers portions of the @xmath38 band of the main isotopomers @xmath39si@xmath40o and @xmath41si@xmath40o . the fine structure is now resolved and emission in the individual rotational - vibrational lines is clearly apparent ; all of the sio lines in this range are @xmath42 branch transitions .",
    "the @xmath39sio line positions used in figure  [ highressio ] were obtained from @xcite ; these include the positions of the @xmath42 banch lines extending from @xmath42(19 ) at 4.0452  @xmath10 m to the bandhead at @xmath42(68 ) ( 4.0043  @xmath10 m ) .",
    "the locations of lines from higher @xmath19 values are not shown ; the wavelengths of these overlap those of the ascending @xmath42 branch but the lines are undoubtably much weaker .",
    "the radial velocity of the low @xmath19 lines is @xmath43(heliocentric ) .    in figure  [ highressio ]",
    "we present a preliminary attempt to model the sio emission , using a simple , optically thin and isothermal slab with a boltzmann population .",
    "the transition probabilities of the @xmath39sio lines used in the model were calculated using the dipole matrix elements given in @xcite .",
    "the less - abundant @xmath41sio isotopic species is not included in the model .",
    "however , there is no clear evidence for its detection in this complex spectrum .",
    "the @xmath41sio bandhead occurs at 4.029  @xmath10 m , and the terrestrial abundance ratio @xmath44 is @xmath45 .",
    "the lack of isolated lines in the spectrum makes it difficult to yield a definitive isotopic ratio , and it is only reasonable to conclude @xmath46 from the present data .",
    "we find that a model with sio excitation temperatures of @xmath47  k is the best representation of the observed spectrum ( a more detailed analysis will be presented elsewhere ) .",
    "this is consistent with the low temperatures seen elsewhere in the infrared spectrum @xcite , and suggests the sio must be located close to the stellar photosphere , rather than further out in the extended atmosphere .",
    "however , a lower sio excitation temperature of 790k was found by @xcite from their earlier spectra ( 2003 january and february ) .",
    "our low resolution data clearly show the sio emission varying over the twelve months to 2003 december ( see figure  [ highressio ] ) , with the strongest emission in the 2003 april spectrum , and it is just as pronounced in the lynch et al .",
    "spectra , albeit at a lower resolution ( see their figure8 ) .",
    "a comparison of their results with our 2002 december 17 spectrum , suggests that the flux in the @xmath48 band had increased by @xmath49 times during the following three weeks .",
    "we note that our model spectrum does not match the observed spectrum at a number of wavelengths in the sio band .",
    "this is almost certainly due to the presence of other , as yet unidentified , lines .",
    "five strong unidentified emission lines can be seen in the region shortward of the sio band head ; their observed wavelengths are 3.9907 , 3.9926 , 4.0003 , 4.0026 and 4.0048  @xmath10 m .",
    "it is probable that other such lines overlap the sio band .",
    "figure  [ highresti ] shows the high resolution spectrum obtained in the wavelength interval 1.2781.286  @xmath10 m .",
    "clearly visible are a sequence of three spectral lines bearing well - defined inverse p cygni profiles with their absorptions centered at 1.2829 , 1.2838 and 1.2854  @xmath10 m .",
    "the only spectral features which can possibly account for these lines are the permitted transitions of ti at 1.282512 , 1.283495 and 1.285054  @xmath10 m .",
    "these resolved ti lines are all remarkably narrow , with an average deconvolved fwhm of @xmath50",
    ". the cores of the absorptions occur at a heliocentric radial velocity of @xmath51 ; the peaks of the emission components are located at @xmath52 .",
    "all of these ti lines originate from the b3z3fo excited states @xcite .",
    "the excitation energies of the b3 lower levels lie between 1.43 and 1.46  ev above the ground state , and thus could be collisionally excited in a low temperature gas .",
    "there is a further ti line ( 1.28115  @xmath10 m ) present in this spectral region at an observed wavelength of 1.28185  @xmath10 m , but the lower level of this a3d ",
    "y3fo transition is further above the ground state ( 2.16 ev ) .",
    "this line is in absorption , but may also possess a weak emission component .",
    "it is difficult to identify the continuum level in this spectral region .",
    "a notable feature of several low resolution @xmath19 band spectra of v838 mon that we have obtained has been the presence of an emission feature near 1.28  @xmath10 m @xcite .",
    "this feature is present in the high resolution spectrum shown in figure  [ highresti ] .",
    "the most logical identification for it is pa@xmath0 ( 1.282159  @xmath10 m ) .",
    "this identification has not been confirmed by detection of other lines .",
    "pa@xmath9 ( 1.875613  @xmath10 m ) occurs in a region of heavy h@xmath7o blanketing in the star and strong attenuation by telluric h@xmath32o .",
    "pa@xmath8 was also not seen in the low resolution data and was not expected given the weakness of the pa@xmath0 emission .",
    "br@xmath9 , another expectedly weaker hydrogen line , is not apparent in the low resolution data presented here in figure  [ lband ] .    the pa@xmath0 line peaks at a heliocentric radial velocity of @xmath53 .",
    "the red wing of the emission is almost absent .",
    "this is a signature of an accelerating / decelerating flow @xcite , but the superposition of other spectral features could also account for the asymmetric profile .",
    "pa@xmath0 absorption , redshifted by @xmath54 ( heliocentric ) , is a possible explanation .",
    "we have presented infrared observations of v838 mon which show sio overtone emission , pa@xmath0 emission and ti lines with inverse p cygni profiles .",
    "there have not been many reported occurrences of sio overtone emission in astronomical objects .",
    "of the few known instances , the phenomenon has been observed in sn 1987a @xcite , the mira variable , @xmath55 ceti @xcite , the rv tauri star , r sct @xcite , and is suspected in the latest m giant stars .",
    "the observed sio bandheads and band structure of the m giant stars sw vir and rx boo have been shown to be too weak as compared with the predictions by model atmospheres with appropriate effective temperatures @xcite .",
    "similar results were noted by @xcite and @xcite , who suggest that sio emission occurs in the outer atmospheres of the coolest o - rich giants , and fills in the strong photospheric sio absorption lines .",
    "the presence of inverse p cygni profiles in the post - eruption spectra of v838 mon is clear evidence that some of the expelled material is now falling toward the star .",
    "the presence of sio and pa@xmath0 emission can be understood if this infall is being compressed and shock - heated by material close to the star , where there are the high densities necessary to collisionally excite the sio ( see @xmath563 ) .",
    "this is similar to the phenomenon seen in pulsating variables where rising and falling layers lead to repetitive shock and line emission very close to the photosphere @xcite .",
    "the sio emission is redshifted by the same velocity as the ti absorption and , if present , the pa@xmath0 absorption .",
    "we therefore conclude that these atomic features must ( like the sio ) arise very close to the star .",
    "the velocity shifts displayed by the ti and pa@xmath0 emissions are similar .",
    "the simplest explanation is that ti and pa@xmath0 trace the same material , with a spherically symmetric distribution , but the difference in excitation suggests that pa@xmath0 arises in a deeper layer . our present observations do not allow us to determine whether additional velocity components are present in the sio emission .",
    "knowledge of the stellar velocity is required in order to convert our measured velocities to the rest frame of the star .",
    "this parameter is uncertain due to the presence of spectral lines with p cygni profiles in the outburst spectra , and the non - detection of molecular rotational emission @xcite .",
    "nonetheless @xcite suggested that the systemic velocity could be @xmath57 on the basis of two such velocity components in the p cygni emissions in the outburst spectra . _",
    "if _ this is the stellar velocity then the infall velocity is @xmath58 , but again we emphasize the uncertainty in the systemic velocity .",
    "the many different outflow velocities and components displayed by the spectral features in the outburst spectra demonstrated the compexities of the gas motions in v838 mon at that time .",
    "titanium is the only atomic species with transitions involving low - lying states in the high resolution spectral range presented here .",
    "follow - up observations are necessary to search for infall signatures in other regions of the spectrum , and to monitor the effect of this infall on the future behaviour of v838 mon .",
