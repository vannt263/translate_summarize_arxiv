    "ultracold atoms combined with optical lattices @xcite can give rise to a clean and controllable platform for simulating and studying quantum many - body physics @xcite , capably demonstrating various quantum phases and even the dynamics of phase transitions .",
    "recently , an efficient optical - lattice trap for rydberg atoms has been realized in the experiment @xcite , extending quantum simulation researches to the realm of rydberg atom physics .",
    "different from the common - used ground - state atoms , the giant dipole moment induced by the highly excited atomic states results in an interaction of unprecedented magnitude and range between two rydberg atoms , that is , the rydberg - rydberg interactions ( rris ) @xcite , which could further lead to the rydberg blockade effect @xcite .",
    "this character of rydberg atoms is conducive to simulate the strong - correlated quantum many - body system @xcite and to realize non - equilibrium quantum phase transitions @xcite .",
    "so far , few attention is paid to the heterospecies rydberg lattice gas , most researches focus on the dynamical phases of single - species rydberg lattice gases when both strong rris and spontaneous emission effects are present @xcite . for a single - species rydberg lattice gas , intrinsically , only the strong rris in the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) sites should be considered @xcite , since the long - range rris due to next - nearest neighbor ( nnn ) interactions are already orders of magnitude smaller @xcite .",
    "however , things will be quite different for the heterospecies case . here",
    "the heterospecies case could be two rydberg atoms of different atomic species or two same species atoms occupied in different rydberg hyperfine states @xcite .",
    "the different excitation frequencies would disrupt the rydberg blockade mechanism as well as those phases existing in the single - species case .",
    "moreover , the rris between heterospecies rydberg atoms can vary by orders of magnitude @xcite which means the nnn interaction between two rydberg atoms of same species could be comparable to the nn interaction between heterospecies atoms , and vice versa .",
    "so the effect of nnn interaction deserves to be discussed in the lattice model of heterospecies rydberg atoms . especially , the importance of nnn interactions has been demonstrated by a recent experiment that the excitation dynamics could be significantly different from the common cases @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we explore the dynamical phase diagram of a one - dimensional ( 1d ) chain of heterospecies rydberg atoms under an open environment .",
    "the rydberg atoms of two different species are alternatively arranged in the 1d optical lattice with internal states being subjected to the laser pumping and spontaneous decay . by the mean - field approximation",
    ", we predict the presence of a rich variety of dynamical phases , involving three stable phases which are the antiferromagnetic phase , the bistable antiferromagnetic phase , and the tristable antiferromagnetic phase , and unstable phases whose dynamics can change from ordinary oscillation to chaos under strong rri case .",
    "no uniform phase that presents in the single - species case is found due to the heterospecies atomic excitations .",
    "we investigate the impacts of repulsive and attractive nnn interactions on those phases and find the stable phases prefer the repulsive ones .",
    "especially , the chaotic phase has been shown high sensitivity to the nnn interactions , which verifies the necessity of including them in our model of heterospecies rydberg atom chain .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we present a scheme for presenting the exciting dynamics of a heterospecies rydberg atom chain and derive basic master equations , from which the stationary state solutions can be solved . in sections",
    "iii and iv , we investigate the change of phase diagrams without and with the effect of nnn rris , respectively . in section",
    "v , we compare the different influences of repulsive and attractive nnn rris on the chaotic phase .",
    "finally , a brief conclusion is given in section vi .",
    "as shown in fig . [ model ] , the system we propose consists of a chain formed by two - species rydberg atoms , trapped in a regular 1d lattice .",
    "an efficient trapping of single rubidium atoms in a 1d optical lattice was initially realized in @xcite , and the loading of different atoms can be using a species - selective optical lattice @xcite . here",
    "we assume the atoms of species @xmath0 and @xmath1 are alternatively arranged in the lattice sites with a filling factor of one atom per site and the hopping of an atom into an adjacent filled site is forbidden by the deep depth of the lattice .",
    "each atom @xmath2 is modeled as a two - level configuration , composed of a ground state @xmath3 and a rydberg state @xmath4 , whose transition is performed by an off - resonant laser beam with the rabi frequency @xmath5 and the one - photon detuning @xmath6 . for the lattice structure here , if we replace the site index by the atom species inside , i.e. , @xmath7 , we will have @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "it is also worth noting that the assumption of two - species atoms can be equivalent to a scheme of same ground - state atoms excited to two different rydberg hyperfine states @xcite .     and",
    "@xmath1 ) trapped in a 1d optical lattice .",
    "atoms are excited from the ground state @xmath10 to the rydberg state @xmath11 by different laser rabi frequencies @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "simultaneously , they are suffering from non - ignorable spontaneous decay @xmath14 .",
    "the nn and nnn rris strength are , respectively , labeled by @xmath15 and @xmath16 , representing the interspecies short - distance and intraspecies long - distance interactions .",
    "the one - photon detunings between the laser frequency and the atomic transition frequency are denoted by @xmath17 and @xmath18 , differently.,width=330,height=134 ]    in the absence of external fields , two atoms prepared in the @xmath19-rydberg states generally interact via a non - resonant van der waals ( vdws ) rri , described by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 represents the position of atom @xmath22 in the lattice and @xmath23 the coefficient for dispersion . to our knowledge , @xmath23 is well - defined @xcite and measured @xcite in the case of same species of atoms , such as rb - rb , na - na , k - k , li - li , cs - cs . however , as for different atomic species or different hyperfine states , @xmath23 changes significantly @xcite . in the present",
    ", we focus on two vdws - type interactions : i ) the interspecies interaction between the nn sites of different atomic species , denoted by @xmath24 ; ii ) the intraspecies interaction between the nnn sites of same atomic species , denoted by @xmath25 or @xmath26 .    here",
    "we consider both the nn and nnn interactions , since the long - range nnn rris between same species of atoms are no longer negligible once the intraspecies interactions are much stronger than the interspecies ones .",
    "other longer - range interactions , such as the next - next - nearest neighbor interaction , is at least by a factor @xmath27 smaller than the nnn interactions , and therefore are negligible here .",
    "then in the frame rotating with the laser frequency , the hamiltonian of the system reads @xmath28 where @xmath29 accounting for the single atom - laser coupling and @xmath30 for the nn rris with @xmath31 ; and @xmath32 or @xmath26 for the nnn rris with @xmath33 .",
    "the system dynamics is described by the master equation of the density matrix operator @xmath34 @xcite : @xmath35 + \\mathcal{l}\\left [ \\rho   \\right ] ,      \\label{master}\\ ] ] where the effect of the spontaneous decay from the unstable state @xmath36 with the rate @xmath14 is included by the lindblad operator @xmath37 = \\gamma \\sum\\limits_j { \\left ( { - \\frac{1}{2}\\left\\ { { \\left| { { r_j } } \\right\\rangle \\left\\langle { { r_j } } \\right|,\\rho } \\right\\ } + \\left| { { g_j } } \\right\\rangle \\left\\langle { { r_j } } \\right|\\rho \\left| { { r_j } } \\right\\rangle \\left\\langle { { g_j } } \\right| } \\right ) } .\\ ] ]    due to the enormous hilbert space , it is hard to perform an exact numerical simulation on the above chain model of large atom number , so we apply the mean - field approximation ( mfa ) here .",
    "compared with the method of monte carlo simulations @xcite , as the interatomic quantum correlation and its fluctuations ignored , the mfa may be failed to predict the phase transition under the same system parameters , or to obtain the exact boundary in the phase diagram . however , the mfa is still regarded as a reliable and adequate tool to qualitatively describe the phase diagram and at least to predict the existence of kinds of steady - state phases @xcite . by the mfa we can neglect the intersite quantum correlation and",
    "factorize the density matrix into each site @xmath38 @xcite . for atom @xmath2 , the second term in eq .",
    "( [ hamtot ] ) should be replaced by @xmath39 , where @xmath40 represent the density matrix elements for the two - level atom in site @xmath41 .",
    "furthermore , we consider two sublattices filled with atoms @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , as shown in fig .",
    "[ model ] .",
    "the excitation probabilities of their rydberg states are different .",
    "that is why the uniform phase can not be found here .",
    "we assume , the nnn interactions between same - species atoms are also relatively weak so its induced blockade effect is ignored .    with all the approximations and the assumptions above",
    ", the motional equations of the density matrix can be derived as @xmath42 where all the frequencies are scaled by decay rate @xmath14 , and the effective detunings are defined as @xmath43 from which we can find the bare detunings are shifted by two nonlinear terms being proportionial to the nn and nnn interactions , respectively .    in principle , via an adjustment of bare detunings @xmath17 and @xmath18 , one can compensate the density - dependent frequency shifts caused by rris so that the effective detunings may vanish .",
    "that is the internal working of the anti - blockade effect in the rydberg chain of single - species atoms @xcite .",
    "however , both the intraspecies and interspecies rris work here , which induce a complicated nonlinear coupling , making that compensation effect become elusive .",
    "we begin our discussions about the dynamical phase diagram of such an open system by studying the feature of the steady - state solutions of eqs.([arr])-([bgr ] ) .",
    "while we set @xmath44 those equations can be simplified into a pair of coupled stationary equations : @xmath45 where the superscript @xmath46 denotes the steady - state solutions .",
    "@xmath47 is defined as in ( [ deltaa ] ) and ( [ deltab ] ) by replacing @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",
    "we find eqs .",
    "( [ daf ] ) and ( [ dbf ] ) can give out nine pairs of roots ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) , in which only the real ones with values belonging to @xmath52 $ ] are physical , since for single two - level atom the excitation probability saturates to 0.5 @xcite .",
    "the stability of these roots can be tested by adding small perturbations and see whether the system can be eventually settled on these solutions .",
    "a detailed description of studying the stability criterion is presented elsewhere , e.g. the supplement of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we classify all the dynamical phases according to the number of the steady - state solutions as well as their dynamical features .",
    "as summarized in table [ summ ] , the total number of physical roots ( prn ) is displayed in the second row , and the number of stable ( srn ) and unstable roots ( usrn ) are in the third row and the fourth row , respectively . if srn@xmath53usrn the dynamical phase is a stable phase ; oppositely , it is an unstable phase . by given parameters ,",
    "in the current scheme we find totally three stable as well as five unstable phases .",
    "stable phases include the antiferromagnetic phase ( labeled by 1af ) with srn=1 and usrn=0 ; the bistable antiferromagnetic phase ( labeled by 2af ) with srn=2 and usrn=1 ; the tristable antiferromagnetic phase ( labeled by 3af ) with srn=3 and usrn=2 .",
    "other five unstable phases are , respectively , labeled by ch1 , ch2 , ch3 , ch4 and ch5 whose srn and usrn can be checked in table [ summ ] .in the following discussions , we will show that the dynamics of these stable phases always settles on one of the stable roots for all cases .",
    "however , as for the unstable phases it is quite different . in the weak - interaction case where the rris are comparable or smaller than the optical coupling strength , the unstable phases tend to show simply oscillatory dynamics ;",
    "while in the strong - interaction case in which the rris play the dominant roles , that is , @xmath54 , the system dynamics easily tends to be chaotic .",
    "the significant difference from the chaotic dynamics to the ordinary oscillatory dynamics is its continuous frequency spectrum without any characteristic frequency as shown in the inserts of fig .",
    "[ phase1 ] below .",
    "besides , we note that although it is demanding to implement , for the phases ch3 ,",
    "ch4 , ch5 , if the system is initially prepared properly , very closing to their stable roots , the dynamics may also be stable and without oscillation .",

    "we use the decay rate @xmath14 as the frequency unit and assume the condition @xmath56 with @xmath57 for strong optical coupling cases and @xmath58 for weak coupling cases .",

    "the system dynamics can be characterized by the single - frequency oscillations due to the presence of weak rydberg interactions , as displayed by the inset of ( a ) .",
    "this finding shows similar results to the single - species atom case in which the dynamics of the system will be periodically oscillating if its corresponding steady - state solutions become unstable ( see fig .",

    "we then pay more attention to the center region where @xmath82 is satisfied .",

    "when the optical coupling increases to be comparable with the interaction strength , as in case ( d ) with @xmath86 , the regions of ch1 expand , but 1af is still the dominant phase .",
    "we stress that due to the small ratio of interaction @xmath15 and @xmath87 , in both cases ( b ) and ( d ) the dynamics of unstable phase ch1 is only normal oscillation rather than chaos .",
    "when we turn to case with a very strong interaction strength and a weak optical coupling , such as case ( a ) with @xmath74 and @xmath73 , besides the phases 1af and ch1 , the phase diagram shows a large number of unique phases , including the bistable phase 2af and unstable phases ch2 , ch3 , and ch4 .",
    "moreover , we find the dynamics of these unstable phases are no longer regular oscillations , but chaotic oscillations without any characteristic frequencies , which is similar to the case shown in the inset of fig.[phase1](b ) . in case ( c )",
    "we keep @xmath74 and increase @xmath87 to @xmath88 . due to narrowing the gap between the interaction strength and the optical coupling , the phase diagram degenerates and",
    "resembles the ones for cases ( b ) and ( d ) .",
    "ch1 becomes the only survival unstable phase and 2af shrinks into narrow areas where the detunings of atoms a and b are almost equal .",

    "we represent a rich variety of dynamical phases of a chain of two - species rydberg atoms held in a 1d optical lattice , where the optical transition between the atomic ground state and the high - lying rydberg state is performed by one - photon excitation .",
    "in particular , except for the nn rydberg interaction between atoms of different species , the long - range nnn interactions between atoms of same species are also considered .",
    "we show that the phase diagrams change a lot when the long - range interaction is included .",
    "especially , the repulsive or attractive long - range interactions can give rise to a clear diffusing or converging effect on the original phase diagrams without them .",
    "for instance , a repulsive nnn rri can help to stabilize the system against chaotic dynamics .",
    "in addition , we also study the real final state of the chaotic phase in the strong - interaction limit and display its sensitivity to the initial atomic preparations on the rydberg state .",
    "most of these results and phenomena are novel , but it is worthwhile to stress when @xmath113 and the nnn rri vanishes , our results will trend to be consistent with the previous findings from the rydberg system of single - species atoms @xcite ."
