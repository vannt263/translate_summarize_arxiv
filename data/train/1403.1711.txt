    "the apparent dearth of very thin disc galaxies in cosmological simulation has put up a challenge against the standard theory of cdm cosmology .",
    "superthin galaxies ( hereafter sgs ) are the extreme case of these flat edge - on galaxies with their axial ratios ( defined as the ratio of scale height to the scale length ) generally below @xmath1 . due to the lack of strong morphological features sgs belong to the late - type in the hubble classification scheme . in few cases , the thin discs of sgs",
    "are seen to be warped e.g. , ugc 7170 , ugc 3697 ( in which case , the axial ratios are @xmath2 ) @xcite which could be considered as the limiting case of a superthin galaxy .",
    "sgs do have other unique properties of the late - type galaxies e.g. , low surface brightness ( lsb ) , high atomic hydrogen gas fractions , low metallicities @xcite .",
    "the extreme thinness of the stellar discs suggest that sgs somehow prevent strong heating in the vertical direction .",
    "it is puzzling how sgs maintain their superthinness over several billion years since they are formed .",
    "observations point out that sgs , like many lsb galaxies , lack environmental influences @xcite which could give rise to tidal heating , heating due to satellite infall or mergers .",
    "the discs of superthin galaxies e.g. , ugc 7321 , ic2233 appear to be featureless , smooth with no visible signs of interactions such as tidal streams or other irregularities @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the resulting stellar discs of cdm simulations are often smaller and thicker @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the heating of stellar discs of sgs are unlikely due to satellite infall , merger or due to massive subhalos ( as it is in the cdm simulations ) .",
    "since external mechanisms appear to be unimportant in heating stars of sgs , one must rely upon various internal sources . indeed , as a galaxy evolves , internal heating of stars in the disc is unavoidable . in the case of our milky way ,",
    "it is evident from the hipparcos data @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown by @xcite that a strong bar could efficiently heat stars in the vertical direction through physical processes like chaotic diffusion suggested by @xcite .",
    "in fact , the possibility that superthin galaxies might be harbouring thin bars e.g. , in ugc 7321 @xcite could not be ruled out unambiguously .",
    "bars are ubiquitous in disc galaxies @xcite suggesting that they are formed spontaneously and perhaps survive through the cosmic evolution ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent review ) .",
    "however , depending on the initial physical condition of a stellar disc and the distribution of dark matter , bars could grow to be stronger over a few rotation time scales or remain weak over several billion years @xcite .",
    "the analysis of @xcite further indicates that weak bars are not efficient in vertical heating of stars  implying that if an initially superthin galaxy were to prevent strong vertical heating , it could possibly do so by growing a weak bar at the most during the course of secular evolution .",
    "the main focus of the current paper is to follow the evolution of such superthin galaxies embedded in various dark matter halo configuration and find out how many of these initial superthin galaxies are able to maintain their thinness such that they are still classified as superthin .",
    "we use collisionless n - body simulations to study the evolution of @xmath3 initially superthin galaxies in isolation .",
    "our study suggest that weak bars are perhaps the maximal non - axisymmetric features that a self - consistent superthin galaxy might be able to support in order to maintain their thinness over several gyr .",

    "section  [ sec : model ] describes the models of superthin galaxies and n - body simulation .",
    "section  [ sec : heating ] summarizes plausible sources of heating relevant for superthin galaxies .",
    "the detailed evolution of superthin galaxies is presented in section  [ sec : evolution ] .",
    "section  [ sec : discuss ] contains the discussion and primary conclusions from this work .",
    "the properties of stellar discs of superthin galaxies resemble many of the key properties of the late - type galaxies , especially that of the low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies @xcite . like lsb galaxies , the dynamics in superthin galaxies",
    "are thought to be primarily governed by their surrounding dark matter halos .",
    "the dark matter dominance in lsb galaxies is evident from the decomposition of rotation curves @xcite and in the case of superthin galaxy ugc  7321 @xcite from the combined modelling of the rotation curves and hi scale  height @xcite .",
    "the sgs are known to have poor star formation activities despite having higher neutral hydrogen gas fraction as in high surface brightness galaxies @xcite .",
    "the very low star formation rates and the apparent absence of strong two - armed spirals and/or strong bars suggest that the stellar discs in superthin galaxies are probably dynamically hot  indicative of a high value of toomre s stability parameter ( q ) ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "we utilize these general properties as guidelines to construct initial n - body models of extremely thin galaxies some of which are presumably progenitors of present day superthin galaxies .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : paratab ]    we present here a sample of @xmath3 very thin ( with the ratio of scale height to scale length @xmath5 being less than @xmath6 or close to it ) equilibrium models of disc galaxies composed of a stellar disc , bulge and dark matter halo constructed using the method of @xcite .",
    "each component in the galaxy model is live and interact with each other via gravitational forces .",
    "the models are scaled so that the unit of scale length ( @xmath7 ) is @xmath8  kpc and the circular velocity at about @xmath9 is @xmath10  kms@xmath11 . for relevant details on model construction ,",
    "the readers are referred to @xcite .",
    "the mass of the stellar disc and other physical parameters of each galaxy model are presented in table  [ tab : paratab ] .",
    "we primarily focus on two fiducial models namely , rhg116 and rhg102 , and analyze their evolution in detail as a comparative study .",
    "[ fig : vc116 ] depicts the initial circular velocity curves for rhg116 and rhg102 .",
    "both the stellar discs of the two models have same initial thickness but the dark matter in the model rhg102 is dominating over the disc right from the center whereas dark matter contribution dominates in rhg116 only beyond about @xmath12 .",
    "each of the galaxy models was evolved in isolation to understand how an initially superthin galaxy would be restructured as result of internal evolution alone .",
    "the simulations were performed using the gadget code @xcite which uses a variant of the leapfrog method for the time integration .",
    "the gravitational forces between the particles are calculated using the bh tree algorithm with a tolerance parameter @xmath13 .",
    "the integration time step used was @xmath14 myr and the models were evolved for about @xmath15  gyrs .",
    "the number of particles used for the halo and disk are @xmath16 each , the bulge contains @xmath17 particles with a total of @xmath18 particles for each model which is in accordance with the suggestion by @xcite .",
    "the softening lengths for the various components were used so that the maximum force on each particle is nearly the same @xcite . the total energy is conserved well within 0.2% till the end of the simulation .",
    "in the absence of environmental influences such as tidal interaction , mergers or satellite infall , the evolution of superthin galaxies would strongly depend on the internal processes .",
    "in particular , vertical heating of stars could change the thickness of stellar discs and perhaps transform a superthin disc into a typical thin or even thick disc .",
    "hence , it is important to identify and understand various internal sources that might be operative in heating the stars in superthin galaxies .    amongst the internal sources of vertical heating the ones that could have been important for superthin galaxies are scattering due to giant molecular clouds @xcite , substructures or clumpiness in the dark matter halo @xcite , bars and transient spirals and/or bending waves @xcite .",
    "however , the low star formation rates suggest that the presence of many giant molecular clouds are unlikely in superthin galaxies .",
    "heating due to substructures in the dark halo are shown to be not efficient because the masses of the substructures are unlikely to be more than @xmath19 and the orbits of the substructures rarely passes close to the disc mid - plane @xcite .",
    "damping of bending waves could , in principle , lead to vertical heating of stars in galaxies .",
    "a detailed study by @xcite showed that a bare stellar slab can become prone to strong bending instability ( or firehose instability ) if @xmath20 . some of the stellar discs in our simulation , indeed , have @xmath21 but we have not noticed any strong bending mode .",
    "possible reason could be that these discs have finite thickness and are embedded in spheroidal dark matter halo  both of which provide restoring force ( proportional to the square of the total vertical frequency , in this context ) to stabilize the bending modes @xcite . in real galactic stellar discs , warps , although common , have small amplitudes @xcite and are thought to rotate with a slow pattern speed ( though not measured ) , see @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "an warp has a little energy ( nearly equal to the kinetic energy of a single globular cluster ) stored in it @xcite to contribute to the vertical heating .    in n - body simulation ,",
    "two - body relaxation due to discreteness noise is a source of heating but the process is known to be suppressed with increasing the number of particles and a convergent behaviour is reached once a simulation contains a few million particles as suggested by @xcite and this has been explicitly tested in a previous paper by @xcite .",
    "note each model galaxy in our sample is composed of @xmath22 particles ( also mentioned in the previous section ) in compliance with suggestion by @xcite .",
    "galaxies are thought to evolve from late - type to early - type along the hubble sequence either through secular evolution or by external influences or a combination of the two , in general .",
    "it is important to understand the rate at which galaxies evolve along such a sequence .",
    "the rate at which any late - type galaxies would evolve towards early - type would certainly depend on various factors such as star formation rate , the efficiency of redistributing energy and angular momentum amongst the stars in the host galaxies . as mentioned in section  [ sec : intro ] , superthin galaxies somehow lack environmental influences . as a consequence ,",
    "the evolution in superthin galaxies are mostly driven by internal mechanisms of which bars could be the most likely candidate .",
    "it is because galaxies do form bars under diverse physical conditions as learned from the studies of n - body simulations as well as inferred from the ample abundance of barred galaxies in the local universe .",
    "since thickness is one of the striking feature which primarily distinguishes superthin galaxies from the rest , we evolve models of initially axisymmetric extremely thin galaxies and follow how their thickness changes .      during the initial phase of evolution when",
    "the disc is still axisymmetric to a good approximation , the vertical structure of the disc can be determined assuming vertical equilibrium under the total potential . under the isothermal approximation along the vertical direction , the scale height of a stellar disc",
    "can then be estimated using the relation @xcite    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the vertical velocity dispersion and @xmath25 is the mid - plane mass density of stars at a location @xmath26 .",
    "the initial density distribution of stars along the vertical direction is well approximated using a @xmath27 law as @xmath28 in our model galaxies . however , as a galaxy evolves , it forms bars , spiral arms or undergoes bending instability , the stars are basically subject to a time - dependent potential .",
    "hence , the above relation for determining the scale height of a stellar disc might not hold true any more .",
    "we determine the scale height of a stellar disc at any epoch during the evolution using the second moment of the volume density distribution as follows @xcite    @xmath29    in the above equation , @xmath30 is the azimuthally averaged density of stars at a location ( @xmath31 ) in the meridional plane .",
    "the scale height of the disc is obtained as @xmath32 .",
    "note that for a @xmath27 density distribution , the method of second moment gives a value of the scale height which is @xmath33 .",
    "the radial variation of @xmath34 would give the flaring information about the stellar disc .",
    "initially , the radial variation of scale height of a stellar disc is flat ( by construction ) and during the subsequent evolution , the stellar discs show mildly flaring .",
    "in fact , previous work by @xcite argue that the scale height of stars in observed galaxies ( such as ngc 891 and ngc 4565 ) are likely to be moderately flaring when one takes into account the gas self - gravity in the hydrostatic balance .",
    "moderate flaring of stars are also required in order to explain the onset of warps in a number of nearby edge - on galaxies @xcite . in the current work ,",
    "we ignore mild flaring of stars and compute the stellar scale height averaged over @xmath35 disc scale lengths which is well outside the radial extent of the bar that forms in most of our stellar discs and use that value of scale height for subsequent analysis . throughout the text",
    ", we use thickness and/or scale height to indicate the same quantity defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : hz ] .",
    "below we discuss detailed evolution of two initially superthin galaxies having same initial thickness that follows two entirely different evolutionary path .",
    "more than @xmath36 of the observed disc galaxies host strong bars in their central regions implying bars are common in disc galaxies @xcite . however , the theoretical understanding of the formation and growth of bars in real galaxies is not yet clear @xcite .",
    "n - body simulations , especially the work of @xcite has shown that a bar can grow stronger in the presence of a live dark matter halo and recent n - body simulations by a number of authors such as @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , reveal further insights on the role of dark matter halo mass distribution in the context of bar growth ; while @xcite showed the importance of halo spin on the bar formation .",
    "once formed , a strong bar is shown to be an efficient source of vertical heating of the disc stars @xcite .",
    "the stellar disc of rhg116 is relatively cold with a toomre @xmath37 ( at @xmath38 ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : tq ] for the radial variation .",
    "the disc forms a strong bar within a billion year ; the evolutionary sequence is depicted through a set of grey - scale images ( fig .",
    "[ fig : den116 ] ) .",
    "subsequently , the bar grows in size and undergoes the well - known buckling instability leading to the formation of a prominent boxy / peanut bulge @xcite at about @xmath39  gyr in this model . a corresponding drop in the value of @xmath40 ( here",
    ", @xmath41 denotes the @xmath42 order fourier component of the surface density distribution ) can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : a2a0 ] . after the buckling phase",
    ", the disc progressively thickens as it is evident from the edge - on images taken at different epochs during the evolution ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : den116 ] ) . during this growing phase of the bar ,",
    "the stars are subject to chaotic diffusion as shown by @xcite . in order to find out the impact of this process , we follow the vertical density distribution of stars at several different locations in the disc and at several epochs during the evolution .",
    "it is important to notice that the disc contains apparently no spiral arms nor any bending modes beyond about @xmath39  gyr and mostly dominated by a bar which as mentioned above , is capable of stirring up the stars globally .",
    "although the impact of a bar on the stars are more visible within the corotation radius , it is equally important to understand how the vertical distribution of stars changes outside this radii as a result of bar driven chaotic diffusion which is not limited to corotation region .",
    "[ fig : rhoz116 ] shows the initial ( t=0 ) and final ( t=5.5  gyr ) vertical density distribution of stars computed at @xmath43 .",
    "this clearly demonstrates how bar alone can fatten the distribution of stars along the vertical direction and this primarily happens through the broadening of the velocity distribution function which was previously shown by @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : thicktime ] , we show the evolution of the stellar scale height computed in a way explained in section  [ sec : thickness ] .",
    "our results show that the disc becomes thicker nearly by a factor of @xmath44 in about @xmath45  gyr . in terms of kpc scale ,",
    "the scale height of stars increases from @xmath46 pc to @xmath47  pc over this time period and the stellar disc leaves the superthin regime . notice that the disc does not have any apparent spiral arms associated with the bar nor any strong bending oscillations in the outskirts of the disc ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : den116 ] ) which becomes hot enough for any of these features to survive over such a longer period of time .",
    "we have carried out this analysis for the rest of the models which formed strong bars , see fig .",
    "[ fig : dentgs ] .",
    "all of these model galaxies were initially superthin and transformed to thin ones over about @xmath4  gyr .",
    "the bar strengths for each model are given in table  [ tab : paratab ] .",
    "an important message is that superthin galaxies are unlikely to host strong bars along their evolutionary path .",
    "looking at the weak bars ( e.g. , type sab ) , it is not clear whether they are formed via partial dissolution of strong bars or due to some other mechanisms @xcite . understanding the properties of weak bars , its formation and growth in real galaxies requires further investigation both in observation and numerical studies .",
    "@xcite report the formation of many weak bars which grow very slowly , typically on a secular evolution time scale . from our present study",
    ", it appears that weak bars are weak from their birth and such weak bars are formed preferentially in galaxies having a higher value of toomre q ( i.e. , radially hot ) combined with a higher dark matter fraction over the stellar counterpart ( quantified as @xmath48 ) , see table  [ tab : paratab ] .",
    "details about one of the weak bar model rhg057 are also presented in @xcite .",
    "the stellar disc of rhg102 is hot with @xmath49 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : tq ] for the radial profile ) and dark matter dominated .",
    "[ fig : den102 ] shows the surface density maps at different epochs and the time evolution of the bar amplitude can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : a2a0 ] .",
    "what we learn from these figures is that the growth of the bar in this model is very slow and remains weak till @xmath50  gyr which is nearly half the hubble time .",
    "some of these models were run for even longer time e.g. , rhg057 which did not grow any stronger bar ( see , * ? ? ?",
    ". the edge - on view of the stellar disc in rhg102 shows no obvious sign of buckling instability because the bar is not self - gravitating enough and the disc lacks vertical inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) @xcite .",
    "from the face - on view of this model galaxy , it is clear that this model also has not formed any strong two - armed spiral and the edge - on view reveals no obvious bending oscillations either ; altogether the stellar disc is able to maintain a smooth , featureless structure over a significant fraction of the hubble time .",
    "this holds true for the rest of the model galaxies in our sample ( see , fig .",
    "[ fig : densgs ] ) which grow nothing but weak bars over a longer period of time .",
    "the time evolution of the stellar disc thickness in model rhg102 can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : thicktime ] .",
    "the thickness increases roughly by a factor of @xmath39 in @xmath51  gyr and remained nearly unchanged till about @xmath52  gyr - indicating a very slow heating process . in terms of kpc scale , the final scale height of stars at @xmath45  gyr is @xmath53 pc indicating that the stellar disc can be considered as one of superthin category .",
    "note that the stellar disc of our milky way has a scale - height of about @xmath54  pc .",
    "the vertical density distribution of stars at @xmath45  gyr resembles quite well the initial @xmath27 profile ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rhoz102 ] ) .",
    "in other words , the vertical density near the mid - plane changes quantitatively by a very small amount .",
    "it turns out that a plausible evolutionary scenario for the superthin galaxies is that they grow weak bars in the central region and are evolving on a very slow secular evolution time scale .",
    "one could , in principle , argue that the observed superthin galaxies might not be forming even weak bars ; but the point we are making here is that it is hard for a galaxy to remain completely axisymmetric over a hubble time as demonstrated for a range of models in fig .",

    ", we investigate how these galaxies are distributed in the parameter space spanned by the thickness of stars and bar strength .",
    "we carry out this exercise at different epochs over a period of @xmath55  gyr .",
    "the initial and final disc thickness are computed using the method described in section  [ sec : thickness ] .",
    "we calculate the initial bar strength ( considered as the peak of @xmath40 ) when the disc has been evolved by an orbital time ( which is @xmath56  myr ) . here orbital time is measured at the disc half - mass radius .",

    "galaxies that formed strong bars leave the superthin regime in @xmath15  gyr time scale transforming into typical thin discs .",
    "in contrast , galaxies that host weak bars remained superthin even after @xmath15  gyr of evolution",
    ". there seems to be a continuous well defined trend ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : a2vshz ] ) in which the thickness of a galaxy s stellar disc varies with the strength of a bar . in no cases , we found galaxies hosting strong bars maintaining its superthinness over a long period of time neither found a case where a galaxy hosting a weak bar and having very fat / thick disc in our sample of galaxies studied here .",
    "this has clearly demonstrated that the galaxies undergoing strong bar instability can not remain superthin over several billion years . in other words , if at all , superthin galaxies that we see today would be hosting only weak bars .",
    "the strength and long - term evolution of a bar are intricately related to the dark matter distribution in the host galaxy , especially in the central region @xcite . in this subsection",
    ", we examine whether the growth and final strength of a bar ( which eventually thicken the stellar disc ) depends explicitly on the core radius ( @xmath58 ) of the surrounding dark matter halo . in fig .",

    "what we find is that the dark matter haloes of superthin galaxies can have a wide range of halo core radius ; the same applies to galaxies that are classified as thin ones in their final state .",

    "this is in accordance with what we have found i.e. , all of our final superthin galaxies have @xmath64 except one with @xmath65 .",
    "what is intriguing is that even thin / thicker galaxies could be surrounded by such compact haloes .",
    "it is worth mentioning that ugc 7321 is an well - studied case of superthin galaxies @xcite .",
    "their study suggests that the superthin galaxy ugc 7321 is an underevolved system both in dynamical and star forming sense . from the disc colors and color gradients ,",
    "they also indicate that ugc 7321 is not a young galaxy .",
    "there is a population of old disc stars above the disc midplane indicating some ongoing dynamical heating in the galaxy .",
    "our study suggests that weak bars could be responsible for a slow heating of the stars in the galaxy .",
    "in fact , the position velocity diagram in hi line @xcite and the deviation of the light profiles in the inner region , the shape of the isophotes in r - band @xcite all together indicate that there might be a thin bar hidden in the galaxy , ugc 7321 . based on our present analysis",
    ", we can comment that such a thin bar ( if present in ugc 7321 ) must be weak ; otherwise it would have gone through a bar buckling instability transforming the superthin disc to a thin one .",
    "the very presence of smooth , featureless superthin galaxies in our local universe suggest that they are not subject to strong minor mergers or significant accretion events , as otherwise they would either be destroyed or converted to thicker disc galaxies @xcite . and if they are isolated as observation indicates , they should be subject to disc heating arising due to the internal sources mentioned in section  [ sec : heating ] . obviously , if we could switch off some of these heating sources , the issue of maintainance of superthinness could be resolved .",
    "our simulations suggest that this is unlikely as stellar discs , with diverse initial condition , form either strong or weak bars both of which heat stars but of course , with varying efficiency . on the other hand ,",
    "the apparently smooth , flat stellar discs also indicate that sgs are unlikely to host strong bars as otherwise such discs eventually would have to face a buckling instability ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for coherent review ) .",
    "the other possibility , which can not be ruled out unambiguously , is that sgs do form weak bars over a longer time scale ( as shown by our simulations ) .",
    "the question arises on the validity of the initial condition that we assume . were progenitors of present day superthin galaxies really radially hot ?",
    "if yes , how those progenitors achieved such a radially hot discs ? the answer , of course , remains unknown as it depends on how these galaxies were actually formed .",
    "we speculate that during the early phase of galaxy formation , an extremely thin disc would have gone through strong spiral instabilities and the amount of preferential radial heating produced by it , would have self - destroyed the spiral arms leaving a red - hot dead disc .",
    "the low star formation rates as suggested by @xcite , indicates that the present day superthin galaxies are radially hot preventing them from forming further strong non - axisymmetric instabilities .",
