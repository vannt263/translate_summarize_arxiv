    "the basic utility of mirror symmetry is its power in the computation of gromov - witten invariants . in terms of classical , compact mirror symmetry ,",
    "these invariants are computed from the coefficients of a generating function , known as the prepotential .",
    "what one does in practice is solve for the period integrals of the mirror manifold , and then identify the prepotential and mirror map as certain linear combinations of ratios of these period integrals .    in the context of local mirror symmetry ,",
    "in which one considers mirror symmetry for noncompact calabi - yau manifolds , such an approach has not appeared to date .",
    "in fact , current technology does not provide us with a means of defining the prepotential in these cases .",
    "this problem emerges because the local mirror manifold does not have ` enough ' period integrals to determine the prepotential . while we can often turn to localization formulas to determine gromov - witten invariants , this is generally more cumbersome than the corresponding @xmath5 model calculation .",
    "the above problem becomes manifest in the case of the mirror computation of @xmath6 , using the double log solution of the usual picard - fuchs system .",
    "as is well known , the hirzebruch surface @xmath7 has one calabi - yau direction in the two dimensional khler cone .",
    "therefore , local gromov - witten invariants associated with curves that have positive degree only in this direction can not be computed from the double log solution , as was suggested in @xcite . in @xcite , we proposed the idea of an extended picard - fuchs system for local mirror symmetry , obtained by modifying the usual picard - fuchs system of local mirror symmetry .",
    "the extended picard - fuchs system has a larger solution space than the usual one , and moreover it has a triple log solution .",
    "therefore , we can compute the full prepotential of a local calabi - yau threefold . in particular ,",
    "in the case of @xmath6 , the triple log solution includes the information of local gromov - witten invariants that can not be detected by the double log solution !",
    "however , a basic problem with the constructions of @xcite is that the instanton expansion of the prepotential was used to derive the extended system . in the case of @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a compact toric surface , this instanton data fixes the triple intersection numbers , which are crucial in the construction of the extended picard - fuchs system . for @xmath3 a local calabi - yau 3-fold with @xmath8",
    ", we had to make direct use of the instanton part of the @xmath9-model prepotential to derive an extended picard - fuchs system .",
    "the aim of this paper is to overcome these weak points in the construction of the extended picard - fuchs system . in the case of @xmath0",
    ", we derive a natural definition of the classical triple intersection numbers of @xmath0 , by generalizing the definition of local gromov - witten invariants given in @xcite .",
    "this definition matches the results in @xcite and explains the moduli parameter of the classical triple intersection numbers found in @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can construct an extended picard - fuchs system of @xmath0 without using the instanton part of the prepotential of @xmath0 .    on the other hand , we may also take advantage of our formula for intersection theory in order to provide an alternate derivation of the prepotential of local mirror symmetry . in the event that @xmath10",
    ", the procedure goes as follows .",
    "first , we construct a compact 3-fold by taking the projective closure of @xmath3 : @xmath11 .",
    "we then consider the local calabi - yau 4-fold @xmath12 and construct an extended picard - fuchs system of @xmath12 by generalizing the results for @xmath0 . with this extended picard - fuchs system",
    ", we can compute the 4-point yukawa couplings of @xmath12 .",
    "finally , we can see the instanton part of the three point functions of @xmath3 by taking the large fiber limit of the fourpoint functions .",
    "this provides a simple algorithm by which we can extract the exact form of the prepotential for @xmath4 ( up to polynomial terms of degree 2 ) .    a problem with this approach appears if the dimension of the compactification fiber gets too large .",
    "in particular , we run into this difficulty for any noncompact threefold @xmath3 such that @xmath13 , @xmath14 . for such examples ,",
    "we provide a method by which one may reduce the problem to a @xmath4 case .",
    "then , in the appropriate limits , we are again able to give a definition for the prepotential .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we first propose a conjecture on a geometrical interpretation of the 3 point functions of local mirror symmetry for @xmath0 , which is a straightforward generalization of the definition given in @xcite , and use this to derive a formula for classical triple intersection numbers for @xmath0 .",
    "then we compute explicitly these numbers for the examples used in @xcite from the localization formula . in section 3 ,",
    "we extend the results of the previous section to the local fourfold @xmath12 and construct the extended picard fuchs system of @xmath12 in the case of @xmath15 .",
    "next , we clarify the relation between the large fiber limit of the 4 point functions of @xmath12 and the 3 point functions of @xmath3 .",
    "we also justify the process of the computation of the b - model 4-point functions by using the extended picard - fuchs system .",
    "section 4 gives the toric construction of the projective closure @xmath16 when @xmath3 is a vector bundle .",
    "section 5 contains applications of the fourfold construction to @xmath4 and the total space of @xmath17 with normal bundle @xmath18 or @xmath19 .",
    "section 6 details methods of dealing with more exotic cases . finally , the extended picard - fuchs system ( in the sense of @xcite ) for the trivalent curve is given in the appendix .",

    "we denote the generators of @xmath23 by @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 is the compactified moduli space of holomorphic maps of degree @xmath26 from @xmath27 to @xmath1 .",
    "the notation @xmath28_{vir.}$ ] means that we always insert the top chern class of the obstruction bundle in the same way as in the usual theory of gromov - witten invariants .",
    "we note that this moduli space does not correspond to the topological sigma model coupled to topological gravity .",
    "therefore , we do nt take the equivalence class of @xmath29 , the automorphism group of @xmath30 , and we also do nt consider the degrees of freedom from moving marked points . instead , we introduce three fixed marked points @xmath31 and define the evaluation maps @xmath32 by @xmath33 .",
    "we also define the map @xmath34 by @xmath35 and the map @xmath36 as the projection map onto the second factor .    in the case of a local 3-fold @xmath0",
    ", we have a birational map between @xmath25 and the usual moduli space of stable maps @xmath37 , because @xmath38 is isomorphic to the position of the three distinguished marked points in @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , this definition coincides with the usual definition of 3-point local gromov - witten invariants of @xmath0 , at least in the case when @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "as is well known , the extension of this conjecture to higher dimensional local calabi - yau manifolds is slightly different from the usual theory of local gromov - witten invariants .    in our previous paper @xcite , a crucial point of the construction of the extended picard - fuchs system of @xmath0 is the determination of the classical part of the yukawa couplings .",
    "therefore , we carefully look at the @xmath40 part of the above conjecture . in this case",
    ", @xmath41 is just the constant map from @xmath27 to @xmath1 , and it is obvious that @xmath42 . hence @xmath43 turns out to be the identity map of @xmath1 .",
    "the map @xmath44 becomes a projection map of the second factor of @xmath45 , and @xmath46 and @xmath47 turn out to be @xmath48 and @xmath0 respectively . with these considerations , the classical triple intersection number @xmath49 ( @xmath50 is the poincare dual of @xmath24 )",
    "is given by the formula :    @xmath51    at first glance , this formula seems to be ill - defined , because division by @xmath52 is not defined in @xmath53 . yet @xmath0 is written in terms of a linear combination of @xmath24 s , and we can therefore expect the following constraints between classical triple intersection numbers by the formal reduction @xmath54 :    @xmath55    where we denote the poincare dual of @xmath52 by @xmath56 . in the case of @xmath57 ,",
    "@xmath58 is generated by the hyperplane class @xmath59 , and the above corollary gives us @xmath60 which coincides with the result in @xcite . in the next subsection , we try to compute the r. h. s. of ( [ cor ] ) with the aid of the localization formula , and we also show that the constraint ( [ const ] ) holds in the results obtained in our previous paper @xcite .    as another application of the above conjecture , we compute the three point function of @xmath6 that corresponds to the non - rigid curve in the fiber direction .",
    "this computation has already been mentioned in @xcite , but it is important in our fourfold construction that will be introduced in the next section .",
    "let us first introduce the toric construction of @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath7 is obtained from dividing @xmath61 by the two @xmath62 actions , @xmath63 the classical cohomology of @xmath7 is generated by the two khler forms @xmath64 and @xmath65 that correspond to the @xmath66 and @xmath67 actions respectively .",
    "these khler forms satisfy the following relations : @xmath68 then we consider two holomorphic maps with degrees @xmath69 and @xmath70 , as follows : @xmath71 note that the fourth entry of @xmath72 should be @xmath48 because of the @xmath73 action . by considering the two @xmath62 actions , we can see that moduli space of @xmath74 and @xmath72 can be compactified into @xmath75 and @xmath76 respectively .",
    "therefore , the image curve of @xmath74 is not rigid in @xmath7 , but the image curve of @xmath72 is rigid in @xmath7 .",
    "next , we extend this construction to @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath6 is constructed by adding a fifth variable @xmath77 and extending the two @xmath62 actions as follows : @xmath78 then the two holomorphic maps in ( [ hol ] ) can be extended to @xmath79 we note here that the fifth entry of @xmath80 should be @xmath48 by the @xmath81 action .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the image curve of @xmath80 is rigid along the non - compact fiber direction , as in the usual situation in local mirror symmetry . but @xmath82 has one additional moduli parameter @xmath83 , which corresponds to a non - compact fiber direction .",
    "this situation is exceptional , and so we compute the three point function @xmath84 for the degree @xmath85 map @xmath82 by the following . if we look back at our conjecture , the appearance of the additional moduli parameter @xmath83 results in the non - trivially of @xmath86 , and this turns out to be @xmath87 in this case . on the other hand",

    "therefore , @xmath93 is identified with @xmath94 and we have @xmath95 .",

    "but we can detect this invariant by the extended picard - fuchs system of @xmath6 constructed in @xcite , since this system has a triple log solution .",
    "this fact is one of the non - trivial advantages of the extended picard - fuchs system .      in this part , we will review the application of the atiyah - bott fixed point formula to torically described surfaces @xmath1 , where the number of independent curve classes @xmath98 is allowed to be arbitrary .",
    "the hirzebruch surface @xmath99 will be used as an example throughout this discussion .",

    ", we can compute the intersection numbers between the 2-cycles on @xmath99 via the fixed point theorem .",
    "then we find e.g. @xmath165 the correct intersection number .",

    "these are exactly the four triple intersection numbers from @xcite@xcite .",
    "indeed has one moduli parameter which agrees with the above results , but it was not mentioned in @xcite . ]",
    "next , consider @xmath99 . here",
    "we will find that we must make a nontrivial choice of torus weights in order to reproduce the expected triple intersection numbers @xcite .",
    "the origin of this complication lies in the fact that the canonical bundle over @xmath99 does not involve a cohomology class from the base curve . in @xcite ,",

    "first , we restate the notation of the previous paper @xcite for the classical cohomology ring of @xmath191 .",
    "it is generated by three khler forms @xmath192 and obeys the 5 relations : @xmath193 as in the previous examples , the @xmath134 are chosen such that if @xmath194 is a basis of @xmath195 , then @xmath196 with this notation , @xmath197 is given by @xmath198 , and the triple intersection numbers are given by the formula : @xmath199 of course , the above expression is formal , but we can read off from this equation the relations between triple intersection numbers : @xmath200 notice that the r.h.s is just the well - defined classical intersection number of @xmath191 .",

    "the extended picard - fuchs system found from the instanton part of the prepotential has the same number of moduli parameters which can not be fixed by the constraints ( [ const ] ) , but the extended picard - fuchs system of @xmath6 has no moduli .",
    "as we have mentioned , this fact seems to be related to the existence of a @xmath85 curve in @xmath6 which is not rigid along the fiber direction .",

    "however , using this compactification , we actually find the result that the @xmath347 curves are overcounted by a factor of 2 .",
    "the reason for this is as follows .",
    "for any toric graph containing figure [ cptification ] as a subgraph , the instanton number of the relevant curve comes out to be @xmath347 .",

    "we begin this section by offering some motivation on the utility of local calabi - yau fourfolds .",
    "we will demonstrate that local fourfolds are one of the more natural objects one might consider in cases where ordinary local mirror symmetry for threefolds breaks down . to this end , consider the space @xmath349 .",

    "the usual constructions of local mirror symmetry @xcite fail for this case , because the picard - fuchs operator is only of order 2 , and its solutions are spanned by @xmath355 where @xmath356 is the mirror map .",
    "this constitutes a failure of mirror symmetry exactly because there is one holomorphic curve in @xmath3 , and this curve is not counted , as we would like .",
    "recently , one remedy for this was offered in @xcite , where an extended picard - fuchs operator was constructed . here , we will take a different approach .",
    "one of the reasons for the problem of the uncounted curve is that @xmath357 has a noncompact deformation space @xmath358 .",
    "hence , we should be able to recover the curve information by compactifying this deformation space ; the simplest choice for such an operation is the projective closure @xmath16 , which is the compact toric manifold given by the vectors @xmath359 we have @xmath360 . notice that this is a @xmath361 fibration over @xmath3 .",
    "unfortunately , this new space is not calabi - yau , but there is a natural local cy fourfold associated to it : @xmath362 this is , of course , just the local cy given by @xmath363 and is the canonical bundle over @xmath16 .",
    "now , recall @xcite@xcite that local mirror symmetry on a space @xmath3 is incomplete ( i.e. , the prepotential can not be reconstructed from solutions of the pf operators ) exactly when @xmath364 . in the case of @xmath365 , there are no four cycles at all , which translates into a lack of predictive power of the instanton expansion via mirror symmetry .",
    "the new space @xmath12 has two four cycles , and moreover the deformation space of the base curve has been compactified , which indicates that this geometry should have the instanton numbers that were lacking on @xmath3 .    on any space @xmath10 , the canonical bundle over a surface @xmath1",

    "note that the assumption of the existence of @xmath426 made above implies a relationship between four point and five point functions : @xmath438 then one could use this formula , together with a degree 5 relation ( for example , @xmath439 ) in order to write down partial differential equations for @xmath1 . if we solve these partial differential equations in our present case , the result is @xmath440 .",

    "we mention , however , that the process of taking the projective completion adds _ more information than in example 1 .",

    "these , and the other two so - computed couplings , have exactly the instanton expansion expected , up to the scaling @xmath472 , which was derived in section 3 .",
    "this means that we should define a prepotential @xmath206 for this space by the equations @xmath473    next , we outline the construction for @xmath474 , the canonical bundle over the second hirzebruch surface .",

    ".    then the prepotential @xmath485 is found by @xmath486    next , we briefly present the same computational procedure carried out on @xmath456 . recall that this is defined by the vectors @xmath487",
    "@xmath456 is the canonical bundle over the blowup of @xmath361 at two points .",
    "then we can immediately write the corresponding vectors for the 4fold over @xmath456 , namely @xmath488 : @xmath489 let @xmath389 be the mirror to this fourfold .",

    "we write here the first two such couplings : @xmath496    these are as expected , up to the overall @xmath472 , which we predicted in section 3 .",
    "this means that we recover the right instanton expansion via the normalization @xmath497",
    "from the above , we have seen that while we can recover much additional information by using the projective closure plus canonical bundle technique , this seems to be unsuitable of there are too many noncompact divisors in the uncompactified geometry .",
    "the reason for this is as follows .",
    "if we attempt a straightforward projective closure procedure on a space with three or more noncompact divisors , the poincare polynomial is badly behaved , and we are thus unable to use the technology introduced above in the computation of fourpoint functions . in particular , any local calabi - yau satisfying @xmath499 , @xmath14 has at least three noncompact divisors , so we need new methods of analysis for such spaces .    with these difficulties in mind",
    ", we will develop tools tailor made to address this problem .",
    "in fact , we are able to show that for a large class of examples , by performing a partial compactification followed by a flop , we can reduce the problem to a @xmath4 type case",
    ". then we have only to refer back to the methods introduced in the preceding sections on @xmath4 , flop the resulting yukawas back and take the appropriate limits to recover the yukawa couplings on the geometry of interest .",
    "we will work through several examples to get a feel for the computational techniques .",
    "we begin with the conifold , @xmath500 .",
    "while the yukawa coupling for the conifold has been derived above through simpler means , we present this example as a template for the types of methods we will use in the sequel .    first , we reemphasize that the basic reason that local mirror symmetry ( that is , local mirror symmetry via picard - fuchs systems ) breaks down for the conifold is that there is no 4 cycle on this space . hence , the pf system on the mirror can not have a double log solution , and therefore we can not recover an instanton expansion .    with this as motivation , we will consider a simple noncompact threefold which contains the conifold geometry , as well as a new four cycle .",
    "the candidate ` compactification ' , which we call @xmath501 , is depicted in figure [ p1completion2 ] , and is defined by the toric charge vectors @xmath502    now , we want to connect this to our previous constructions , i.e. the canonical bundle over a surface case . but this is easy , because @xmath501 admits a flop to @xmath503 : @xmath504 that is , @xmath505 .",
    "now we use the machinery of previous sections .",
    "let @xmath506 be the noncompact fourfold associated to @xmath503 , defined by charge vectors @xmath507 we denote the mirror of @xmath508 by @xmath389 .",
    "this procedure is summarized by the following sequence of operations : @xmath509 & \\tilde{x_1}\\ar[r ] & \\tilde{x}_1^{flop}\\cong k_{f_1}\\ar[r ] & k_{\\bar k_{f_1 } } } \\ ] ] then exactly as in the @xmath348 case , we can compute @xmath5 model fourpoint functions @xmath510 on @xmath389 by using the picard - fuchs system . here",
    "@xmath511 are the local variables on the complex structure moduli space of @xmath389 .",
    "the next step is to carry the @xmath5 model fourpoint functions across the flop on the @xmath5 model , defined by the change of variables @xmath512 we let @xmath513 be the manifold we get by using the flop transformation on @xmath389 . here",
    ", we have to remember that the @xmath510 transform as rank 4 tensors .",
    "then , we have fourpoint functions @xmath514 on @xmath513 , which is also the mirror of the fourfold over @xmath515 .",
    "let @xmath463 be the logarithmic solutions of the picard - fuchs system on @xmath513 .",
    "next , use the inverse mirror map @xmath516 to convert the @xmath514 into @xmath9 model fourpoint functions @xmath517 on the fourfold over @xmath518 , again taking the tensor property into account . and then finally , we can recover the expected yukawa threepoint function @xmath519 on @xmath520 in the limit as @xmath521 .",
    "since this whole procedure has been rather complicated , we summarize the various steps in the following diagram . @xmath522 & \\tilde{y}^{mnp}_{(4 ) } \\ar[r ] & \\tilde{c}^{mnp}_{(4 ) } \\ar[r ] & c_{x_1 }   \\\\        y \\ar[r ] &    \\tilde y \\ar[r ]     &   k_{\\bar{k}_{\\tilde{x}_1 } } \\ar[r ]   &   x_1   } \\ ] ] the functions along the top line are the fourpoint functions of the corresponding spaces on the bottom line . on the bottom line , the first arrow is given by the flop , the second by the mirror map , and the third by taking the double limit @xmath523 .",
    "these two limits are to be understood as first taking the size of the @xmath524 to infinity , and then taking the limit of the large compactification fiber ( that is , the limit in which the noncompact fourfold becomes a noncompact threefold ) .",
    "the result of this is @xmath525 here , an extra factor @xmath302 appear because we have used a @xmath27 compactification .",
    "[ zerominustwo ] for our next example , we revisit @xmath526 . once again , though we have already worked out the yukawa coupling for this case through the fourfold , we now want to take a look at another way of deriving this fourpoint function .",
    "the reason is that this new viewpoint is the one that will prove to be naturally applicable to the general case .    as in the previous example , we want to add a four cycle at some convenient location in the geometry in order to recover the instanton expansion .",
    "in contrast with the previous example , we also have to simultaneously compactify the one parameter noncompact deformation space of this @xmath17 . the only choice that satisfies both of these criteria is @xmath348 : @xmath527 this is depicted in figure [ p1completionsecond ] .",
    "now , we have already done the fourfold calculation on @xmath348 , so we only have to refer to the yukawa couplings above , eqn.([f0fourpoint ] ) .",
    "let @xmath528 be that taken from eqn.([f0fourpoint ] ) , and let @xmath422 be the sizes of the two @xmath17s in @xmath174 .",
    "then we find , in the relevant limit , @xmath529    so , even after taking into account the extra factor @xmath472 from the fourfold compactification , we still see that the instanton expansion is twice what we expect it should be .",
    "the reason for this is , however , easy to see . in the @xmath348 geometry ,",
    "if we perform a direct localization calculation , then we find that there are two curves in each of the two homology classes , which is obvious from the toric diagram .",
    "thus , in order to recover the correct expansion , we have to remove by hand the excess state . after doing this we indeed get what we were expecting , complete with the overall negative sign @xcite .",
    "we now present our computational scheme in its general form .",
    "the basic idea is to complete all curves with normal bundle @xmath19 by using the @xmath174-type compactification given in example [ zerominustwo ] .",
    "this kind of example was first considered in @xcite . after doing this",
    ", we find that we can recover all yukawa couplings using the same trick as above , i.e. by flopping to a canonical bundle case and then taking the noncompact fourfold over the canonical bundle .",
    "this method works well for a reasonably broad class of geometries .",
    "we will carefully go through the details of two more examples .",
    "[ example7 ] we take @xmath3 to be a local threefold with @xmath530 defined by the charge vectors @xmath531 there are two curves @xmath532,@xmath533 corresponding to the vectors @xmath534 respectively . from the vectors we can read off that @xmath535,@xmath536 .",
    "there is one more curve @xmath537 which also has a normal bundle of @xmath538 .",
    "then , from the examples of the previous section it is clear that we only need to compactify the @xmath532 curve in order to derive a complete set of yukawa couplings using the fourfold construction .",
    "let the space we get by compactifying the @xmath532 family be denoted by @xmath539 .",
    "then @xmath539 is given by the charge vectors @xmath540 in order to convert this to a canonical bundle case , we can flop to @xmath456 : @xmath541 this is depicted in figure [ dpfour ] .",
    "now that we have a canonical bundle case , we can proceed as usual with the fourfold calculation .",
    "let @xmath542 be the khler parameter corresponding to @xmath543 .",
    "since we have already worked out all the fourpoint functions for the del pezzo , we can just use these and flop them back to find the appropriate yukawa couplings for the present case . after doing this",
    ", we find the threepoint yukawa couplings on the original geometry in the large fiber limit : @xmath544 we again see the same phenomena from the earlier examples .",
    "first , the overall @xmath472 comes from @xmath27 compactification associated to @xmath456 .",
    "secondly , we have to remove by hand the overcounted state which is represented by @xmath545 after this , we find complete agreement with the expected instanton information on this space @xcite .",
    "in other words , we may define a prepotential for this example by @xmath546 up to the overcounted @xmath547 curve .",
    "finally , we want to consider a rather complicated example , which will help to illustrate the general procedure .",
    "the space we have in mind was considered in @xcite , and is specified by charge vectors @xmath548 we denote this by @xmath3 .",
    "note that @xmath549 , and the three curves in @xmath3 have a single point of intersection .",
    "the toric graph of this space , complete with triangulation , is shown in figure [ trivalent1 ] .",
    "now , from the previous examples of this type , the general idea we have followed is to ` compactify ' the curves with normal bundle @xmath550 via the scheme we originally used for the one parameter space @xmath551 . in our present situation ,",
    "such curves are not evident , but we can make them manifest by performing a flop transition .",
    "we call the resulting space @xmath552 , and its charge vectors are @xmath553 then , we see that the second and third curves have normal bundle @xmath550 .    in order to keep the calculation from getting too unwieldy , we will only compactify one of the @xmath547 curves , and proceed with the calculation on the resulting space . upon doing this ,",
    "we get a new space @xmath554 specified by charge vectors @xmath555 from the charge vectors alone , it is a bit hard to see what is going on , so we have given a diagrammatic representation of this procedure in figure [ trivalent2 ] .    before diving into the details ,",
    "let us briefly consider what exactly it is that we are expecting to learn through the study of this space @xmath556 .",
    "the only real difference between @xmath557 and @xmath556 is that on the latter , a single @xmath547 curve family has been compactified .",
    "if we look back at the original geometry @xmath3 , this corresponds to ` filling in ' the curve information corresponding to the @xmath558 curve on @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the predicted result is that the instanton expansion we find will enumerate curve data corresponding to the curves @xmath559 , and @xmath558 .",
    "that is , we will obtain all information corresponding to curves with normal bundle @xmath18 , plus the curve @xmath558 ( which has normal bundle @xmath19 ) that we have completed by using our compactification .",
    "finally , this last curve should be counted with an overall @xmath347 in the instanton sum , as a result of the type of compactification we are using .    with that being said ,",
    "let s proceed with the computation .",
    "the first thing we have to do is associate a noncompact fourfold to the above geometry @xmath556 . in the previous examples",
    ", we have done this by first reducing to a canonical bundle case and then compactifying the canonical bundle .",
    "while this can indeed be done here , we claim in the present case that it suffices to compactify the variable corresponding to the compact divisor in the geometry . from figure [ trivalent2 ]",
    ", it is clear that there is exactly one compact divisor , namely @xmath177 , and moreover this corresponds to the fifth column of the matrix of charge vectors defining @xmath556 .",
    "one can see this by recalling the charge vectors for @xmath560 : @xmath561 here , the divisor corresponding to the first column represents the @xmath177 , and we note that the fifth column of the charge vectors for @xmath556 also contains two @xmath347 entries .    then",
    ", it is straightforward to write down the charge matrix of the fourfold over @xmath556 : @xmath562 we denote the above space by @xmath210 .",
    "let us consider a bit further why it is that we expect this fourfold to reproduce the instanton information we are looking for .",
    "previously , most of our successful calculations have been done on a canonical bundle example .",
    "notice first of all that we can perform two flops on @xmath556 to reach a canonical bundle case : @xmath563 this is done by first flopping the second vector of @xmath556 , and then flopping the fourth vector of the resulting space . on this matrix",
    ", it is clear that the fifth column corresponds to the single compact divisor , and furthermore all entries of the fifth column are less than or equal to 0 , so that this is a @xmath4 case .",
    "this can also be seen by constructing the vertices for this manifold . now , since the compactification variable is fixed across the flop , it should be sufficient to just work directly on the space @xmath210 above . and indeed , this will turn out to be the case .",
    "let @xmath209 be the mirror manifold to @xmath210 .",
    "we omit the details , but merely note that there are 10 order two picard - fuchs operators @xmath564 whose solution space describes the period integrals of @xmath209 .",
    "let @xmath565 be the logarithmic solutions of this system .",
    "as in all previous cases , we use the extended set of differential operators @xmath566 in order to solve for the fourpoint functions of @xmath209 .",
    "let @xmath567 be the fourpoint functions so obtained .",
    "then we first use the inverse of the mirror map @xmath565 to transform these fourpoint functions on @xmath209 into fourpoint functions @xmath568 on @xmath210 .",
    "next , we recover the threepoint functions @xmath569 on @xmath552 in the double scaling limit : @xmath570 and lastly , we can compute the threepoint functions we are looking for , @xmath571 on @xmath3 , by reversing the flop transition on @xmath572 ( this function transforms as a rank 3 tensor ) .",
    "after all is said and done , we arrive at the threepoint functions for @xmath3 . for brevity , we list only a representative subset of the results here : @xmath573 from these functions , we can see many of the previously advertised features of the compactification scheme we have chosen .",
    "as expected , the @xmath574 curve appears with an overall @xmath347 factor , from the @xmath177 type compactification . besides this , the expansion is missing both of the other double curve classes @xmath575 and @xmath576 . in other words , for example , we would expect to find the term @xmath577 in the expansion for @xmath578 , since the @xmath576 curve has normal bundle @xmath550 .",
    "this can be seen from the topological vertex calculation @xcite .    nonetheless , since the original space @xmath3 is pairwise symmetric under the exchange of any two of the curves with normal bundle @xmath18 , it is clear that we could have compactified either of the other two @xmath547 curves and picked up the missing terms ala eqn.([wasuremono ] ) .",
    "therefore , up to the overall fraction @xmath579 , we have arrived at the expected instanton expansion .",
    "the extra factor @xmath472 appears in the same way as in all previous examples .    finally , to close this example , note that there is in fact more we can do with the space @xmath556 . that is , instead of taking the limit @xmath580 , we can also consider the limit @xmath468 .",
    "the result of this is shown in figure [ otherlimit ] .",
    "this is a different calabi - yau , which we denote by @xmath210 , and we can use the same results above in this new limit in order to compute the threepoint functions on @xmath210 . without going into any detail , we merely list two of the threepoint functions obtained this way : @xmath581 in other words , the curve information corresponding to the term @xmath582 is missing .",
    "this is expected , because we did not compactify this curve family .      in the two preceding examples , the type of compactification we used",
    "was chosen according to topological vertex calculations @xcite . in the following , we present an argument that in some sense , the sign choice coming from the vertex computation is artificial ( that is",
    ", it is extrinsic to the geometry ) .",
    "consider again example [ example7 ] .",
    "the compactification used there , which was originally suggested in @xcite , was made so that we would find the following result for the instanton part of the prepotential : @xmath583 recall that @xmath584 was the complexified khler parameter for the curve with normal bundle @xmath19 , and the khler parameters @xmath575 and @xmath585 both correspond to curves with normal bundle @xmath18 . in other words ,",
    "we have associated a minus sign to @xmath586 curves , and a plus sign for @xmath587 curves .",
    "however , we claim that from the geometry of example [ example7 ] alone , this sign choice is not unique . for example , were we to use instead the instanton part @xmath588 the answer would be equally ` acceptable ' , in the following sense .",
    "we recall from @xcite,@xcite the conjecture that the @xmath5 model yukawa couplings should be simple rational functions , such that the denominator consists of the components of the discriminant locus .",
    "then , if we use either @xmath589 or @xmath590 ( together with the triple intersection numbers conjectured in @xcite ) , we find rational @xmath5 model yukawa couplings of exactly the same level of complexity . moreover , the resulting extended picard - fuchs system @xcite is also of roughly the same form",
    ".    we will add further evidence to this claim in the appendix , where we construct the extended picard - fuchs system for the mirror of the trivalent curve for both choices of sign convention .",
    "indeed , it turns out that in both cases , we find a system of nearly identical complexity .",
    "the main features of this paper are summarized as follows .    first , in @xcite",
    ", we made use of the instanton expansion for @xmath4 cases in order to compute the allowed values for the classical triple intersection numbers ; in the present work , through the use of the canonical bundle formula , we have carried out the computation of these numbers in a way that is more intrinsic to the geometry .",
    "secondly , we have seen , besides the construction of the prepotential , the resolution of another problem encountered in @xcite . in @xcite , in order to construct the extended picard - fuchs system for @xmath3 such that @xmath591 , we took for granted the known instanton expansion from the topological vertex .",
    "above , we have overcome this through the use of a special compactification scheme @xcite which is known to agree with the vertex result ; the advantage of this is that , in principle , it applies to any @xmath3 with @xmath591 .",
    "we briefly mention some directions for future study .",
    "we are currently working to extend our results to non - nef toric varieties and their canonical bundles , e.g. @xmath592 for @xmath593 and @xmath594 for @xmath595 . in both cases , we will need to take advantage of the machinery of generalized mirror symmetry ( ala jinzenji , iritani , coates - givental ) in order to complete the calculation .",
    "we hope to report on these matters in future work .",
    "since this model is symmetric under the permutation of the three khler parameters , we present a minimal set of formulas for brevity .",
    "first , we start from the a - model yukawa couplings obtained from the body of this paper with the constant term predicted in @xcite : @xmath596 we can also read off the mirror maps from the ordinary picard - fuchs system of trivalent toric graph as follows : @xmath597 then , we can obtain 3-fold version of the a - model gauss - manin system for this toric - graph , as was defined in @xcite . after transforming this gauss - manin system into the b - model by the above mirror maps ,",
    "we can obtain the extended picard - fuchs system @xmath598 as relations of the b - model gauss - manin system . here , we present @xmath599 as follows .",
    "@xmath600 are obtained from the cyclic permutation of the subscripts @xmath601 of @xmath599 : @xmath602 this operator is rational but really complicated .",
    "of course , this system is one example of the extended picard - fuchs system for this space , and there may well be a more concise extended picard - fuchs system .",

    "finally , we present the b - model yukawa couplings obtained from the above extended picard - fuchs system . these yukawa couplings are indeed transformed into the a - model yukawa couplings ( [ a ] ) by the mirror transformation ( [ m ] ) ."

    "<S> we then extend this formalism to local fourfolds @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a complex 3-fold . as a result , we are able to fix the prepotential of local calabi - yau threefolds @xmath4 up to polynomial terms of degree 2 . </S>",
