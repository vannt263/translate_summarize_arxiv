    "the statistical properties of radiation introduces a new degree of freedom that plays a decisive role in optics @xcite : like e.g. in scattering processes @xcite , or speckle processing @xcite , of relevance for the mechanical action of radiation beyond coherent light approaches @xcite .    in this work",
    "we emphasize schell model sources whose spectral degree of coherence and radiant intensity distribution are both gaussian @xcite ( gsms ) .",
    "they constitute an extraordinary instance of partially coherent source that can be implemented in the laboratory without an excessive difficulty @xcite .",
    "recently , the theory and consequences of the optical force generated by beams from this type of sources at far distances , or for general abcd systems , where evanescent waves can be neglected , were reported @xcite .",
    "by contrast , in this work we address these forces in the near - field of the source .    for this purpose",
    ", we put forward a theory of forces based on the concept of coherent mode representation ( cmr ) of partially coherent fields , due to e. wolf , ( see refs .",
    "this approach establishes that the cross spectral density of a system of any state of coherence may be expressed as the sum of contributions from spatially completely coherent elementary sources , and so are its consequences for the electromagnetic force .",
    "we shall use this cmr of optical forces not only on single particles , but also for studying radiation - induced forces between objects , usually referred to as optical binding @xcite . specifically",
    ", we shall address the forces due to gsms light , acting between two cylinders .",
    "we will exploit the morphology dependent resonances ( mdr ) of these objects to form different types of bonds between them .",
    "it will also be shown how the spatial coherence of the source affects the attraction or repulsion of these bodies .",
    "although dielectric , the particles here addressed are also magnetic , namely they respond to the incident wave magnetic vector via induced magnetic dipoles and multipoles .",
    "they recently have provoked much interest because their potential as exotic scatterers capable of introducing configurations with artificial magnetism @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we briefly outline in section [ of_gsms ] the theory of optical forces with partially coherent light emerging from a gsms , with emphasis in the near - field .",
    "then in sections [ cmr ] and [ one_dimansional_gsms ] we develop the concept of stochastic forces from the point of view of the cmr .",
    "later , in the subsequent subsections , this method is analyzed and implemented through calculations of increasingly complex configurations . in sections [ sec : num_setup ] and [ sec : 2particles ] we apply this theory to the specific case of the mechanical action on a pair of magnetodielectric cylinders .",
    "an appendix is added to show the confirmation of our discussion .",
    "we shall consider mie dipolar particles , namely those whose scattering properties can be expressed in terms of the first electric and magnetic mie coefficients @xcite .",
