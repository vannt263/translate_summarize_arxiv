    "the physical significance of the phase of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) has raised a number of interesting foundamental quantum - mechanical questions.@xcite interference is observed even when two condensates are prepared _",

    "the most credited explanation of the observation of interference in two - mode bose systems relies on the beautiful idea that the relative phase of the condensates is established by measurement .",
    "the phase offset of each single interference pattern changes from run to run , so that no interference persists if many interference patterns are superimposed : there is thus no contradiction with the standard quantum - mechanical interpretation of first - order interference .",
    "this  measurement - induced interference \" was first proposed in ref .   and then corroborated by a number of studies.@xcite the interpretation of the experimental results has also been formalized in terms of positive operator valued measures.@xcite .",
    "these ideas bear consequences on our understanding of symmetry breaking phenomena.@xcite    we showed in ref .",
    "that interference is robust with respect to the state preparation . each time",
    "two condensates are experimentally prepared ( e.g.  out of a single condensate , by inserting a `` wall '' between them@xcite ) , their wave function is sampled out of a portion of the total hilbert space that depends on experimental procedures and details ( state preparation ) .",
    "since we have no access to this information , we have to look at the _ typical _ features of such a wave function , namely those features that characterize its behavior and properties in the overwhelming majority of cases .",
    "we find that the very presence of an interference pattern emerges as a typical feature of the wave function.@xcite    in the present article we will build on this observation and focus on phase randomization effects due to self - interaction within the condensate , to clarify how the phase randomization process can take place .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section [ sec - typicality ]",
    "we introduce the ensemble of initial states and review its properties .",
    "in particular , we define and analyze the averages and variances of the physical observables .",
    "section [ sec - observables ] is devoted to the study of the general properties of the observable which are directly related to interference , in a second - quantization framework . in section  [ sec - gauss ]",
    "we review the main results on the typicality of interference between two expanding gaussian modes , which constitute a realistic model of a bec interferometry experiment . in section  [ sec - self ]",
    "we consider the role of the interaction among particles and write down a simple hamiltonian model , and in section  [ sec - typs ] we show how an initial coherent state evolves under this hamiltonian .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec - pseudo ] , we show how this simple physical mechanism yields a dynamical randomization of the phases in the two - mode fock basis .",
    "we consider a typical experimental setup of bec interferometry : a condensate is distributed among two orthogonal modes , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which are usually spatially separated at some initial time .",
    "then the atomic clouds are let to expand , overlap , and ( possibly ) interfere .",
    "let us assume that the total number of bosons @xmath2 is fixed .",
    "a useful basis for such a system is given by two - mode fock states @xmath3 with @xmath4 , in which the two modes @xmath0 and @xmath1 are orthonormal , and have well - defined occupation numbers .",
    "we assume that @xmath2 is even for simplicity .",

    "the number operators @xmath12 and @xmath13 count the numbers of particles in the two modes .",
    "the crucial assumption@xcite is that the initial state of the two - mode system is randomly picked from the subspace spanned by the fock states with @xmath14 , @xmath15 with @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is odd for simplicity , and the microcanonical density matrix reads @xmath18 the case @xmath19 was studied by a number of authors,@xcite while we are more interested in the large-@xmath17 case .",

    "the coefficients @xmath29 for @xmath30 are randomly sampled from the surface of the @xmath31-dimensional unit sphere @xmath32 .",
    "the assumption of _ uniform _ sampling is a simplifying one : the number of states that are actually involved in the description and their amplitude will depend on the experimental procedure and the way the two bec clouds are created.@xcite due to this assumption , the quadratic _ statistical _ average over all experimental runs  ( [ eq : ensemble ] ) reads @xmath33 while the average of the coefficients themselves , as well as all the quantities that depend on the phases of the coefficients , will vanish .    in a given run , with state @xmath24",

    "the statistical average of its expectation value in state @xmath24 reads @xmath40 computations of ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) both involve the quartic average@xcite @xmath41 .",
    "notice , however , that their sum involves only quadratic averages , and is in fact given by the quantum mechanical variance of @xmath34 in the microcanonical state @xmath42 in  ( [ eq : microcanonical ] ) : @xmath43    a few comments are in order .",
    "if the initial state is sampled from the degenerate distribution with @xmath19 ( which is in fact deterministic and concentrated on the single balanced fock state ) , the average quantum variance @xmath44 coincides with the quantum variance of @xmath45 , while , obviously , @xmath46 .",
    "in such a case , the same state is prepared in every run ( which requires a very careful preparation procedure and is a somewhat unrealistic assumption for the experiments performed so far ) .",
    "on the other hand , if the ensemble is made up of eigenstates of the observable @xmath34 , then the quantum fluctuations vanish , @xmath47 , and the only contribution to ( [ totfluc ] ) comes from the statistical fluctuations @xmath48 , that differentiate individual runs .",
    "an observable is _ typical _ if @xmath49 , and is _ stable _ at each run if @xmath50 .    in general ,",
    "different fluctuations are present in a given experiment .",
    "we analyzed the interference of a two - mode bose - einstein system according to these ideas and showed that some features of the interference pattern ( such as its period and its fringe contrast ) are _ robust _ against both the afore - mentioned fluctuations,@xcite and thus @xmath51 .",
    "we shall summarize the main results in the following sections and shall comment on the role of @xmath52 for an interesting observable , the power spectrum of particle density.@xcite",
    "since we are interested in the quantities that are related to interference , we will focus on those observables associated with the spatial distribution of particles.@xcite in this section we will review the relevant averages in the general case , postponing quantitative considerations to the following section . in the second - quantization formalism , the spatial density is represented by the operator @xmath53 whose fourier transform reads @xmath54(\\bm{k } ) = \\int d\\bm{r } \\ , e^{-i \\bm{k } \\cdot \\bm{r } } \\hat{\\rho}(\\bm{r}).\\ ] ] expanding the field operators and taking the expectation value ( [ expgen ] ) , one finds that the average density @xmath55 is merely the sum of the particle densities in the two modes , with no interference between them .",
    "clearly , this property holds also for the fourier transform .",
    "this result apparently contrasts with experimental observation , as interference is present even if no phase coherence between the particles in the two modes exists .",
    "however , the average ( [ exprho ] ) can not give sufficient information on the result of a _ single _ experimental run , since its fluctuations are very large .",
    "on the other hand , the outcome of a single run can be inferred , within a controlled degree of approximation , from the study of the _ density power spectrum _ , i.e.  the square modulus of its fourier transform:@xcite @xmath56 observe that all states @xmath24 in ( [ psin ] ) are eigenstates of the total number operator @xmath57 belonging to the eigenvalue @xmath2 , that is fixed , which makes the role of the last addendum in ( [ rho2k ] ) immaterial .",
    "notice also that the power spectrum @xmath58 is the fourier transform of the density autocorrelation function @xmath59 under specific assumptions on the values of @xmath2 and @xmath17 in ( [ 6 ] ) , we will show that fluctuations around the average value @xmath60 are negligible .",

    "the final result reads @xmath64 in which the fourier transforms of @xmath65 , directly related to interference , appear .",
    "[ remember that we always assume @xmath21 . ]",
    "we now estimate the fluctuations of @xmath66 according to the philosophy outlined in the previous section . in order to estimate the fluctuations of @xmath58 around its average and",

    ", we will analyze an experimentally relevant case in which the distribution of @xmath69 displays sharp peaks that provide information on the interference pattern in each experimental run , with fluctuations being negligible in proper ranges of @xmath2 and @xmath17 .",
    "in the light of the general results on the density power spectrum @xmath58 and its fluctuations , we will review in this section the properties of a realistic model , describing a physical situation that is close to experimental implementation .",
    "the cold atoms are initially trapped in two gaussian clouds by an external double - well potential .",
    "the distance between the peaks of the distributions is significantly larger than their widths , so that the initial wave packets do not overlap .",
    "the trap is then released and the clouds expand freely until they overlap and interfere .",
    "we will explicitly consider the time evolution of the system in one spatial dimension , for simplicity : if scattering between the particles in the condensates is neglected , the time dependence can be evaluated by observing that the correlation functions at time @xmath70 are obtained by replacing the initial modes @xmath71 with their time - evolved counterparts @xmath72 with @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the width of the gaussians and @xmath75 is the half distance between their maxima , chosen large enough in order to ensure that @xmath76 are approximately orthogonal .    a straightforward calculation yields@xcite @xmath77 where the coefficients @xmath78 depend on the structure of the modes , but neither on the number of particles @xmath2 , nor on the dimension @xmath17 of the sampled hilbert subspace .",
    "equation ( [ deltargauss ] ) shows that fluctuations are at most @xmath79 when @xmath21 .",
    "this implies that if @xmath21 ( i.e.  @xmath80 for @xmath81 ) fluctuations around the average @xmath82 in in different experimental runs are negligible , and the distribution of its values is peaked around its most probable value .",
    "these results prove that interference is typical , and occurs for the overwhelming majority of wave functions of the condensate when @xmath21 .",
    "we observe that similar conclusions are obtained when one deals with plane waves rather than gaussian modes,@xcite the only difference being in the explicit expression of the coefficients @xmath78 in eq .",
    "( [ deltargauss ] ) . presumably , the dependence on @xmath2 and @xmath17 will not change for a wide range of mode functions . in this sense ,",
    "our conclusions are of general validity .",
    "the results reviewed in the previous sections were obtained by averaging over an ensemble of states .",
    "it is not immediate to relate these results to an experiment , since one should introduce a mechanism to sample the random states according to the desired distribution .",
    "we will show in the following that the randomization of the _ phases _ in the fock basis emerges in a natural and straightforward way , once interparticle scattering is considered .    in a classical double - slit experiment",
    ", first - order interference is observable if the relative phase @xmath83 between the incident waves at each slit does not vary over time .",
    "the corresponding case for a condensate is that of a two - mode _ coherent _ state [ see eq .",
    "( [ coherent ] ) in the following ] , in which all the @xmath2 particles are in the same superposition of mode wave functions .",
    "a first - order interference pattern can be observed in a coherent state , with the same offset @xmath83 at each experimental run .",
    "it is not obvious that a coherent state is created when two ( independent ) bose - einstein condensates are prepared .",
    "nevertheless , we shall now scrutinize the evolution of a coherent state when the bose gas is self - interacting .",
    "in such a case , the phases in the fock basis expansion become ( pseudo)random after an initial transient , which vanishes in the @xmath81 limit .",
    "we will show that this behavior is closely related to a loss of coherence between the two modes , which leads to the disappearence of the first - order pattern after the initial transient .",
    "this is also related to the general theory of the josephson effect@xcite and spin squeezing.@xcite our previous results ensure , on the other hand , that an interference pattern can be observed also in this case , despite its offset fluctuates over time and experimental runs .",
    "let us consider a bose system with particles distributed in two _ spatially separated _ orthonormal modes @xmath84 and @xmath85 , whose supports @xmath86 and @xmath87 do not overlap .",
    "assume that the energies of a single particle in each mode be equal , so that we can set them equal to zero for convenience , and that the tunneling between the two modes is negligible .",

    "even if all the coefficients of the states  in the fock basis are nonvanishing , the presence of the binomial coefficient implies that for large @xmath2 the states can be very well approximated by truncating the sum at @xmath104 : the approximate states thus belong to @xmath105 [ see eq .",
