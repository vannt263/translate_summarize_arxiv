    "driven all fiber cavities constitute a basic configuration in nonlinear fiber optics . more specifically , experimental studies have demonstrated that when these cavities are pumped by a continuous wave , they exhibit spontaneously self - organized temporal structures in the form of trains of short pulses with well defined repetition rate @xcite . the theoretical prediction of this phenomenon was carried out in the seminal paper by lugiato and lefever ( ll model , @xcite ) .",
    "the breakup of continuous wave into trains of pulses is attributed to the competition between the following phenomena ( i ) a nonlinear mechanism which is originated from the intensity - dependent refractive index ( kerr effect ) that tends to amplify locally the field intensity , ( ii ) a chromatic dispersion which on the contrary tends to restore uniformity , and ( iii ) dissipation .    besides a train pulses distribution , temporal localized structures ( tls ) are found in a well - defined region of parameters called a pinning zone . in this regime , the system exhibits a coexistence between two states : the uniform background and the train of pulses of light that emerges from subcritical modulational instability @xcite . in the same way as in the temporal regime where the breakup of continuous wave into trains of pulses results from the interplay between nonlinearity and group velocity dispersion , in spatial cavities , the competition between nonlinearity and diffraction induces the formation of two - dimensional localized structures @xcite .",
    "when the dispersion and diffraction have a comparable influence , their competition with nonlinearity could produce varieties of three - dimensional periodic and localized `` light bullet patterns '' @xcite .",
    "these structures consist of regular 3d lattices of bright light bullet traveling at the group velocity of light in the material .",
    "temporal localized structures are often called dissipative solitons or cavity solitons . experimental observations of tls in all fiber nonlinear cavity has stimulated further the interest in this field @xcite .",
    "nowadays , temporal localized structures in standard silica optical fibers is an active field due to the maturity of the fiber technology and the possible applications as an ideal support for bits in an optical buffer that could be used for all - optical storage , all - optical reshaping and wavelength conversion @xcite .",
    "recently , experimental study reveals that the interaction between two temporal localized structures is ultra - weak @xcite . for large intensity regime ,",
    "temporal cavity solitons could exhibit a self - pulsation or chaotic behavior @xcite .",
    "front propagation and switching waves between the two stable homogeneous steady states has been investigated experimentally and theoretically in nonlinear all fiber cavities subject to injection @xcite .",
    "more recently , the study of front propagation into an unstable state reveals that during time evolution , the velocity of propagating front evolves according to the universal power law @xcite .    in all above mentioned studies , the dispersion is limited to fiber cavities with group - velocity dispersion restricted to the second order .",
    "however , when an optical cavity is operating close to the zero dispersion wavelength , high - order chromatic dispersion effects could play an important role in the dynamics of photonic crystal fiber ( pcf ) @xcite .",
    "photonic crystal fiber permit a high control of the dispersion curve and allow exploring previously inaccessible parameter regimes @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of the fourth order dispersion in the description of all fiber cavities , permits the modulational instability to have a finite domain of existence delimited by two pump power values @xcite and allows for the stabilization of dark temporal localized structures @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown that the combined influence of the third- and the fourth - order dispersion induced a motion of dark localized structures in large intensity regime @xcite .",
    "these moving solutions involved an asymmetric odd or even number of dips which coexist for finite values of the input field intensity .",
    "when the spatio - temporal dynamics of pcfs cavities is ruled by ultrashort pulses , mutlistability as well as a spontaneous breaking in pulse - shape symmetry has been observed @xcite .",
    "more recently , the role of the third order dispersion in the dynamics of the bright temporal localized structures in micro - ring resonators pumped in a proximity of the zero of the group velocity dispersion has been reported @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", it is our aim to analyze analytically the influence of high order dispersion on the nonlinear dynamical properties of bright temporal localized structures in all photonic crystal fiber cavity .",
    "we derive a normal form in the vicinity of the first modulational instability threshold by taking into account of the second , the third and the fourth order dispersion .",
    "the weakly nonlinear analysis allows us to determine the threshold associated with the emergence of tls .",
    "in addition , we show that the third order dispersion corrects the linear velocity and pushes tls to move with a constant velocity .",
    "this regular drift is induced by a broken reflection symmetry mediated by a third - order dispersion .",
