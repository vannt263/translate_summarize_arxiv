    "as summarized elsewhere in these proceedings our recent work has demonstrated that at the low accretion rates appropriate for dwarf novae ( dn ) , the core temperature , @xmath0 , of the wd is _ set _ by the long - time average accretion rate , @xmath1 , of the binary @xcite . with @xmath0 set",
    ", we determine the wd luminosity , which depends on @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and the mass of the freshly accreted layer .",
    "this luminosity is directly observable for dn when the disk is in quiescence and the surface of the wd has cooled after outburst .",
    "in the quiescent state , the broadband colors are just that of a hot wd plus a low mass main sequence star or brown dwarf companion . figure [ fig : m4 ] shows the color and magnitude we predict for quiescent cv binaries using standard cv evolution to relate the companion mass to @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the data shown for comparison are members of the globular cluster m4 as determined by proper motion studies with _ hst _ @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5 wd primary spends approximately 1 gyr in the zz ceti instability strip .",

    "<S> our recent theoretical work ( townsley and bildsten 2002 ) on the thermal state of white dwarfs ( wds ) in low mass transfer rate binaries allows us to predict the broadband colors of the binary from those of the wd and companion when the disk is dim . </S>",
    "<S> the results based on standard cv evolution are presented here . </S>",
    "<S> these will aid the discovery of such objects in field surveys and proper - motion selected globular cluster surveys with _ hst _ ; especially for the largely unexplored post period minimum cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) with the lowest accretion rates and degenerate companions . </S>",
    "<S> we have also calculated the fraction of time that the wd resides in the zz ceti instability strip thus clarifying that we expect many accreting wds to exhibit non - radial oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> the study of these will provide new insights into the rotational and thermal structure of an actively accreting wd . </S>"
