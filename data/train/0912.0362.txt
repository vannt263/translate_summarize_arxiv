    "metamaterials are artificial structures having negative refractive indices for some wavelengths  @xcite .",
    "while natural materials having such properties are not known , it was the initial paper @xcite that sought to realize artificial metamaterials which triggered the rapidly increasing interest in this topic . over the past decade ,",
    "the physical properties of these structures , and their possible applications in modern optics and microelectronics , have received considerable attention ( see e.g. refs @xcite ) .",
    "the reasons for such interest are their unique physical properties , their ability to overcome the diffraction limit  @xcite , and their potential role in cloaking  @xcite , the suppression of spontaneous emission rate @xcite , and the enhancement of quantum interference @xcite , etc .    until recently ,",
    "most studies considered only ideal systems and did not address the possible effects of disorder . however , real metamaterials are always disordered , at least , in part , due to fabrication errors .",
    "accordingly , the study of disordered metamaterials is not just an academic question but is also relevant to their application . the first step in this direction",
    "was made in ref .",
    "@xcite where it was shown that the presence of a single defect led to the appearance of a localized mode .",
    "a metamaterial with many point - like defects was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite where it was demonstrated that even weak microscopic disorder might lead to a substantial suppression of wave propagation through a metamaterial over a wide frequency range .",
    "the next steps in this direction focused on the study of localization in metamaterials .",
    "anderson localization is one of the most fundamental and fascinating phenomenon of the physics of disorder",
    ". predicted in the seminal paper  @xcite for spin excitations , it was extended to the case of electrons and other one - particle excitations in solids , as well as to electromagnetic waves ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , becoming a paradigm of modern physics .",
    "anderson localization results from the interference of multiply scattered waves , manifesting itself in a most pronounced way in one - dimensional systems  @xcite , in which all states become localized  @xcite so that the envelope of each state decays exponentially away from a randomly located localization center @xcite .",
    "the rate of this decay is non - random and is called the lyapunov exponent , @xmath0 , the reciprocal of which determines the size of the area of localization .    in a finite , but sufficiently long , disordered sample , the localization manifests itself in the fact that the frequency dependent transmission amplitude is ( typically ) an exponentially decreasing function of the sample size .",
    "the average of this decrement is a size - dependent quantity , whose inverse ( _ i.e. _ , reciprocal ) is termed the _ transmission length , _ @xmath1 . in the limit",
    "as the sample becomes of infinite length , the decrement tends to a constant non - random value .",
    "the reciprocal of this value determines another characteristic spatial scale of the localized regime , which is the _ localization length , _",
    "it is commonly accepted in both the solid state physics and optical communities , that the inverse of the lyapunov exponent , @xmath3 and the localization length , @xmath2 are always equal . while this is true for media with a continuous spatial distribution of the random dielectric constant , in the case of randomly layered samples , the situation , as we show in this paper ,",
    "is more complicated . in particular , the inverse of the lyapunov exponent by itself , calculated , for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite , does not provide comprehensive information about the transport properties of disordered media .",
    "furthermore , it is unlikely that it can be measured directly , at least in the optical regime .",
    "the first study of localization in metamaterials was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite where wave transmission through an alternating sequence of air layers and metamaterial layers of random thicknesses was studied .",
    "localized modes within the gap were observed and delocalized modes were revealed despite the one - dimensional nature of the model . a more general model of alternating sequences of right- and",
    "left - handed layers with random parameters was studied in ref .",
    "there , it has been shown that in mixed stacks ( m - stacks ) with fluctuating refractive indices , localization of low - frequency radiation was dramatically suppressed so that the localization length exceeded that for homogeneous stacks ( h - stacks ) , composed solely of right- or left - handed slabs , by many orders of magnitude and scaling as @xmath4 or even higher powers of wavelength ( in what follows we refer to this result as the @xmath5 anomaly ) , in contrast to the well - known dependence @xmath6 observed in h - stacks  baluni . as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , a possible physical explanation of this is the suppression of phase accumulation in m - stacks , related to the opposite signs of the phase and group velocities in left- and right - handed layers . scaling laws of the transmission through a similar mixed multilayered structure",
    "were studied in ref .",
    "there , it was shown that the spectrally averaged transmission in a frequency range around the fully transparent resonant mode decayed with the number of layers much more rapidly than in a homogeneous random slab .",
    "localization in a disordered multilayered structure comprising alternating random layers of two different left - handed materials was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that within the propagation gap , the localization length was shorter than the decay length in the underlying periodic structure , and the opposite of that observed in the corresponding random structure of right - handed layers .    in this paper , we study the wave transmission through disordered m- and h - stacks of a finite size composed of a weakly scattering right- and left - handed layers . in the framework of the weak scattering approximation ( wsa ) , we have developed a unified theoretical description of the transmission and localization lengths over a wide wavelength range , allowing us to explain the pronounced difference in the transmission properties of m- and h - stacks at long wavelengths .",
    "when both refractive index and layer thickness of the mixed stack are random , the transmission length in the long wavelength part of the localized regime exhibits a quadratic power law dependence on wavelength with different constants of proportionality for mixed and homogeneous stacks .",
    "moreover , in the localized regime , the transmission length of a mixed stack differs from the reciprocal of the lyapunov exponent of the corresponding infinite stack ( to the best of our knowledge , in all one - dimensional disordered systems studied till now these two quantities always coincide ) .    both m- and h - stacks",
    "demonstrate a rather narrow crossover from the localized to the ballistic regime . the h - stack in the near ballistic region , and the m - stack in the ballistic region are weakly scattering disordered stacks , while in the far ballistic region , the h - stack transmits radiation as an effectively uniform medium .",
    "we also consider the effects of loss and show that absorption dominates the effects of disorder at very short and very long wavelengths .",
    "the crossover region is particularly sensitive to losses , so that even small absorption suppresses oscillations in the transmission length as a function of frequency .",
    "all of the theoretical results mentioned above are confirmed by , and are shown to be in excellent agreement with , the results of extensive numerical simulation .    in m -",
    "stacks with only refractive index disorder , anderson localization and transmission resonances are effectively suppressed and the crossover region between the localized and ballistic regimes is orders of magnitude greater .",
    "a more detailed study of the @xmath5-anomaly shows that the genuine wavelength dependence of the transmission length is not described by any power law and rather is non - analytic in nature .    in what follows , sec .",
    "[ sec : mod ] presents a detailed description of our model .",
    "section [ sec : anal ] is devoted to the analytical studies of the problem , while the results of numerical simulations and a discussion of these are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : num ] .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional alternating m - stack , as shown in fig .",
    "it comprises disordered mixed left- ( @xmath7 ) and right- ( @xmath8 ) handed layers , which alternate over its length of @xmath9 layers , where @xmath9 is an even number .",
    "the thicknesses of each layer are independent random values with the same mean value @xmath10 . in what follows ,",
    "all quantities with the dimension of length are measured in units of @xmath10 . in these units , for the thicknesses of a layer we can write    @xmath11    where the fluctuations of the thickness , @xmath12 @xmath13 are zero - mean independent random numbers .",
    "we take the magnetic permeability for right - handed media to be @xmath14 and for metamaterials to be @xmath15 , while the dielectric permittivity is    @xmath16    where the upper and lower signs respectively correspond to normal ( right - handed ) and metamaterial ( left - handed ) layers .",
    "the refractive index of each layer is then    @xmath17    where all @xmath18 and absorption coefficients of the slabs , @xmath19 , are independent random variables . with this , the impedance of each layer relative to the background ( free space ) is    @xmath20    with the same choice of the sign .",
    "we begin with the general case when both types of disorder ( in refractive index and in thickness ) are present .",
    "two particular cases , each with only one type of disorder , are rather different . in the absence of absorption , the m - stack with only thickness disorder is completely transparent , a consequence of @xmath21 .",
    "however , the case of only refractive - index disorder is intriguing because , as is shown below , such mixed stacks manifest a dramatic suppression of anderson localization in the long wave region @xcite .",
    "although localization in disordered h - stacks with right - handed layers has been studied by many authors @xcite , here we consider this problem in its most general form and show that the transmission properties of disordered h - stacks are qualitatively the same for stacks comprised of either solely left- or right - handed layers .",
    "we introduce the transmission length @xmath1 of a finite random configuration as    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the random transmission coefficient of a sample of the length @xmath24 as a consequence of the self - averaging of @xmath25 ,    @xmath26    this means that for a sufficiently long stack ( in the localized regime ) the transmission coefficient is exponentially small @xmath27 .    in what follows ,",
    "we consider stacks composed of layers with low dielectric contrasts , _ i.e _",
    ", @xmath28 so that the fresnel reflection coefficients of each interface , and of each layer , are much smaller than @xmath29 here , a thin stack comprising a small number of layers is almost transparent . in this , the ballistic regime , the transmission length takes the form    @xmath30    involving the average reflection coefficient @xcite , which is valid in the case of lossless structures .",
    "this follows directly from eq .",
    "( [ ll-0 ] ) by virtue of the conservation relationship , @xmath31 .",
    "thus , in the ballistic regime ,    @xmath32    where the length @xmath33 in this equation is termed the _ ballistic length_.    accordingly , in studies of the transport of the classical waves in one - dimensional random systems , the following spatial scales arise in a natural way :    * @xmath1  the transmission length of a finite sample ( [ ll-0 ] ) , * @xmath2  the localization length ( [ ll-3 ] ) , and * @xmath33  ballistic length ( [ ll-31 ] ) .",
    "note that in the case of absorbing stacks ( @xmath34 ) , the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ ll-0 ] ) defines the attenuation length , @xmath35 , which incorporates the effects of both disorder and absorption .    in what follows ,",
    "we show that contrary to commonly accepted belief , the quantities @xmath36 , @xmath2 , and @xmath33 are not necessarily equal , and , under certain situations , can differ noticeably from each other .    in this paper",
    ", we study mainly the transmission length defined above by eq .",
    "this quantity is very sensitive to the size of the system and therefore is best suited to the description of the transmission properties in both the localized and ballistic regimes .",
    "more precisely , the transmission length coincides either with the localization length or with the ballistic length , respectively in the cases of comparatively thick ( localized regime ) or comparatively thin ( ballistic regime ) stacks .",
    "that is ,    @xmath37    another argument supporting our choice of the transmission length as the subject of investigation is that it can be found directly by standard transmission experiments , while measurements of the lyapunov exponent call for a much more sophisticated arrangement .",
    "the theoretical analysis involves the calculation of the transmission coefficient using a recursive procedure . consider a stack which is a sequence of @xmath9 layers enumerated by index @xmath38 from @xmath39 at the rear of the stack through to @xmath40 at the front .",
    "the total transmission ( @xmath41 and reflection ( @xmath42 ) amplitude coefficients of the stack satisfy the recurrence relations @xmath43 for @xmath44 , in which both the input and output media are free space . in eqs",
    "( [ rec1 ] ) and ( [ rec2 ] ) , the amplitude transmission ( @xmath45 ) and the reflection ( @xmath46 ) coefficients of a single layer are given by    @xmath47    here , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 denotes the dimensionless free space wavelength .",
    "while the sign of the phase shift across each slab @xmath51 varies according to the handedness of the material , the fresnel interface coefficient @xmath52 given by    @xmath53    depends only on the relative impedance of the layer @xmath54 , a quantity whose real part is positive , irrespective of the handedness of the material",
    ".    equations ( [ rec1])-([ro ] ) are general and provide an _ exact _ description of the system and will be used later for direct numerical simulations of its transmission properties .",
    "it was mentioned previously that we consider the special case of weak scattering for which the reflection from a single layer is small .",
    "_ i.e. _ , @xmath55 .",
    "this occurs either for weak disorder , or for strong disorder provided that the wavelength is sufficiently long .",
    "the transmission length then follows from    @xmath56    and requires the following first order approximations derived from eqs .",
    "( [ rec1 ] ) and ( [ rec2 ] ) :    @xmath57    in deriving eq .",
    "( [ rec4 ] ) , we omit the first - order term @xmath58 since it contributes only to the second order of @xmath59 already after the first iteration .",
    "then , by summing up logarithmic terms ( [ rec3 ] ) , we obtain    @xmath60    this equation enables us to derive a general expression for the transmission length @xmath61 which is valid in all regimes ( see the next section ) .",
    "however , the ballistic length @xmath33 , according to eq .",

    "where both refractive index and thickness of each layer is random , we have developed an effective analytical approach , which has enabled us to calculate the transmission length over a wide range of input parameters and to describe transmission through m- and h - stacks in a unified way .",
    "all theoretical predictions are in excellent agreement with the results of direct numerical simulations .",
    "there are remarkable distinctions between the transmission and localization properties of the two types of stacks .",
    "when both types of disorder ( refractive index and layer thickness ) are present , the transmission length of a h - stack in the localized regime coincides with the reciprocal of the lyapunov exponent , while for m - stacks these two quantities differ by a numerical prefactor .",
    "this is quite surprising and , to the best of our knowledge , it is the first time that a system where such a difference exists has been discovered .",
    "it is shown that the stacks of m- and h - type manifest quite different behaviour of the transmission length as a function of wavelength .",
    "this difference is most pronounced in the long wavelength region . in the localized regime ,",
    "stacks of both types are strongly disordered and reflect the incident wave almost entirely . in the ballistic regime , where stacks are almost transparent , the transport properties of h - stacks and m - stacks are markedly different .",
    "h - stacks , over the moderately long wavelength ballistic region , and m - stacks , over the entire long wavelength region , are weakly scattering disordered structures . in the extremely long wavelength ballistic region ,",
    "the h - stack becomes effectively uniform  a regime which is absent for m - stacks because of the intrinsic non - uniformity caused by the alternating nature of the structure .",
    "the crossover regions between different regimes are comparatively narrow .",
    "the transmission length for a single realization is non - random in the localized regime for both types of stacks .",
    "it fluctuates strongly over the entire ballistic region for m - stacks and in the near ballistic regime for h - stacks . in the far long wave region for h - stacks ,",
    "the fluctuations apparent in the transmission length are moderate and decrease with increasing stack length . in the case of m - stacks , the transition from the localized to the ballistic regime is accompanied by a change in the wavelength dependence of the transmission length . in contrast , for h - stacks , the corresponding change occurs in the vicinity of the transition from the near to the far ballistic regime .",
    "again , the crossover regions between the different regimes are comparatively narrow .    in m",
    "- stacks with only refractive - index disorder , anderson localization is substantially suppressed , and the localization length grows with increasing wavelength much faster than the classical square law dependence .",
    "the crossover region becomes significantly wider , and transmission resonances occur in much longer stacks than in the corresponding h - stacks .",
    "the effects of absorption on the one - dimensional transport and localization have also been studied , both analytically and numerically . in particular , it has been shown that the crossover region is particularly sensitive to losses , so that even small absorption noticeably suppresses the oscillations of the transmission length in the frequency domain .",
