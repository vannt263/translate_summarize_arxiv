    "the random - cluster representations of various models have played an important role in the study of physical systems and phase transitions .",
    "they provide a different viewpoint for physical models and many problems in the ising and potts models can indeed be solved by using their random - cluster representations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    for @xmath13 and an integer @xmath14 , a spin configuration in the @xmath5-state potts model at inverse temperature @xmath15",
    "can be obtained as follows .",

    "if the spin is chosen from a set @xmath7 with an integer @xmath18 and the probability of spin @xmath8 is @xmath19 with positive integers @xmath20 such that @xmath21 , then we get the so - called fuzzy potts model @xcite .",
    "recent papers ( see @xcite ) have shown that generalizations of the above constructions with different values of @xmath5 and @xmath22 , as well as more general rules of spin assignment , are also of interest . from a mathematical viewpoint ,",
    "such models are natural examples of a dependent site percolation model with a simple definition but nontrivial behavior .",
    "the study of such models may also lead to a better understanding of models of primary physical importance , as was the case in @xcite , where an informative , new perspective on the high temperature ising model on the triangular lattice was given .    the model treated here",
    "is defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath23 be a ( finite or infinite ) locally finite graph .",
    "fix parameters @xmath0 $ ] , @xmath1 in such a way that there exists exactly one random - cluster measure for @xmath24 with parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we denote this measure by @xmath25 .",
    "also , fix an integer @xmath26 and @xmath27 such that @xmath28 , and define the _ single - spin space _ @xmath29 and the _ state space _",

    "let @xmath33 be a random bond configuration taking values in @xmath34 with distribution @xmath35 .",
    "given @xmath36 for some @xmath37 , we construct a random @xmath38-valued spin configuration @xmath39 by assigning spin @xmath40 with probability @xmath9 to each connected component in @xmath41 ( i.e. , the same spin @xmath8 to each vertex in the component ) , independently for different components .",
    "we write @xmath42 for the joint distribution of @xmath43 on @xmath44 and @xmath45 for the marginal of @xmath46 on @xmath38 .",
    "this definition is a slight generalization of the fractional fuzzy potts model defined in @xcite , page  1156 ( see also @xcite , section 1.2 ) .",
    "however , we shall call this model the _ @xmath5-divide and color _ [ @xmath6 _ model _ to emphasize that we look at it as a generalization of the model introduced in @xcite by hggstrm [ which is the dac(1 ) model in the present terminology ] , rather than of the fuzzy potts model of @xcite .",
    "let us now consider the ( hypercubic ) lattice with vertex set @xmath47 and edge set @xmath48 with edges between vertices at euclidean distance @xmath49 . with an abuse of notation , we shall denote this graph by @xmath3 and the sets @xmath50 and @xmath51 by @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively .",

    "is known about random - cluster measures with @xmath60 than with @xmath61 .",
    "we shall prove that , except in the special case of @xmath62 and @xmath63 [ when the @xmath12 model coincides with the @xmath5-state potts model on @xmath3 at inverse temperature @xmath64 , the @xmath12 model is not @xmath54-markovian for any  @xmath54 .",
    "for large values of @xmath4 , @xmath65 is not even quasilocal and is therefore not a gibbs measure , again with the exception of the potts case .",
    "this shows that the gibbsianness of the potts model at low temperatures is very sensitive with respect to perturbations in the assignment of the spin probabilities ; even the smallest change makes the model nonquasilocal . by demonstrating the special role of the @xmath5-state potts gibbs measure among @xmath12 models ,",
    "our result supports the view expressed in @xcite that , especially at low temperatures , gibbsianness of measures is the exception rather than the rule . for a related general result , see @xcite , where israel proved that in the set of all translation invariant measures , gibbsianness is exceptional in a topological sense .",
    "however , if @xmath4 is small enough , then gibbsianness does hold .",
    "the proof of this fact uses the idea that at small values of @xmath4 [ which correspond to high temperatures in the ( fuzzy ) potts model ] , the @xmath12 model is close in spirit to independent site percolation on @xmath3 .",
    "these results are in line with those in @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) concerning the fuzzy potts model and , in some cases , essentially the same proofs work in the current , more general situation .",
    "therefore , in some instances , only a sketch of the proof is given and the reader is referred to @xcite for the details .",
    "note , however , that such similarities are not immediate from the definitions of the models .",
    "more importantly , in the @xmath12 model , a distinction must be made between the case when @xmath66 for all @xmath8 and when there exists some @xmath67 with @xmath68 . in the former (",
    "of which the fuzzy potts model is a special case ) , a rather complete picture can be given , whereas in the latter , there is an interval in @xmath4 where we do not know whether @xmath69 is a gibbs measure .",
    "finally , we give a sufficient ( but not necessary ) condition for the almost sure quasilocality of @xmath65 and , as an application , we obtain this weak form of gibbsianness in the two - dimensional case for a large range of parameters .",
    "some intuition underlying our main results will be described after remark [ pottsmarkovian ] .",
    "in this section , we recall the definition of fortuin  kasteleyn ( fk ) random - cluster measures and those properties of these measures that will be important throughout the rest of the paper . for the proofs and much more on random - cluster measures , see , for example , @xcite .",
