    "the radiation observed from blazars is dominated by the emission from relativistic jets ( blandford & rees 1978 ) which transport energy and momentum to large scales . as the energy content on such scales already implies in some sources jet powers comparable with that which can be produced by the central engine ( e.g. rawlings & saunders 1991 )",
    ", only a relatively small fraction of it can be radiatively dissipated on the ` blazar ' ( inner ) scales .",
    "however we still do not know the actual power budget in jets and in which form such energy is transported , namely whether it is mostly ordered kinetic energy of the plasma and/or poynting flux .",
    "in addition , the predominance of one or the other form can change during their propagation .",
    "these of course are crucial pieces of information for the understanding on how jets are formed and for quantifying the energy deposition on large scales .    in principle",
    "the observed radiation can  via the modelling of the radiative dissipation mechanism  set constraints on the minimum jet power and can even lead to estimates of the relative contribution of particles ( and the corresponding bulk kinetic power ) , radiation and magnetic fields .",
    "the modelling depends of course on the available spectral information and conditions on the various jet scales ( i.e. distances from the central power  house ) .",
    "attempts in this direction include the work by rawlings & saunders ( 1991 ) , who considered the energy contained in the extended radio lobes of radio  galaxies and radio  loud quasars . by estimating their life ",
    "times they could calculate the average power needed to sustain the emission from the lobe themselves ( burbidge 1959 ) .    at the scale of hundreds of kpc the _ chandra _ satellite observations , if interpreted as inverse compton scattering on the cosmic microwave background ( tavecchio et al .",
    "2000 ; celotti , ghisellini & chiaberge 2001 ) , indicate that jets of powerful blazars are still relativistic . this allowed ghisellini & celotti ( 2001 ) to estimate a minimum power at these distances for pks 0637752 , the first source whose large scale x ",

    "chandra_. several other blazars were studied by tavecchio et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , sambruna et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and tavecchio et al .",
    "( 2007 ) who found that the estimated powers at large scales were comparable ( within factors of order unity ) with those inferred at much smaller blazar scales .",
    "celotti & fabian ( 1993 ) considered the core of jets , as observed by vlbi techniques , to derive a size of the emitting volume and the number of emitting electrons needed to account for the observed radio luminosity .",
    "the bulk lorentz factor , which affects the quantitative modelling , was estimated from the relativistic beaming factor required not to overproduce , by synchrotron self ",
    "compton emission , the observed x  ray flux ( e.g. celotti 1997 ) .",
    "a great advance in our understanding of blazars came however with the discovery that they are powerful @xmath0ray emitters ( hartman et al .",
    "their @xmath0ray luminosity often dominates ( in the powerful flat spectrum radio  loud quasars , fsrqs ) the radiative power , and its variability implies a compact emitting region .",
    "the better determined overall spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and total observed luminosity of blazars constrain  via pair opacity arguments ( ghisellini & madau 1996 )  the location in the jet where most of the dissipation occurs . for a given radiation mechanism",
    "the modelling of the sed also allows to estimate the power requirements and the physical conditions of this emitting region .",
    "currently the models proposed to interpret the emission in blazars fall into two broad classes .",
    "the so - called ` hadronic ' models invoke the presence of highly relativistic protons , directly emitting via synchrotron or inducing electron  positron ( e@xmath1 ) pair cascades following proton - proton or proton  photon interactions ( e.g. , mannheim 1993 , aharonian 2000 , mcke et al .",
    "2003 , atoyan & dermer 2003 ) .",
    "the alternative class of models assumes the direct emission from relativistic electrons or e@xmath1 pairs , radiating via the synchrotron and inverse compton mechanism .",
    "different scenarios are mainly characterised by the different nature of the bulk of the seed photons which are compton scattered .",
    "these photons can be produced both locally via the synchrotron process ( ssc models , maraschi , ghisellini & celotti 2002 ) , and outside the jet ( external compton models , ec ) by e.g. the gas clouds within the broad line region ( blr ; sikora , begelman & rees 1994 , sikora et al .",
    "1997 ) reprocessing @xmath210 per cent of the disk luminosity .",
    "other contributions may comprise synchrotron radiation scattered back by free electrons in the blr and/or around the walls of the jet ( mirror models , ghisellini & madau 1996 ) , and radiation directly from the accretion disk ( dermer & schlickeiser 1993 ; celotti , ghisellini & fabian , 2007 ) .",
    "some problems suffered by hadronic scenarios ( such as pair reprocessing , ghisellini 2004 ) make us favour the latter class of models . by reproducing the broad band properties of a sample of @xmath0ray emitting blazars via the ssc and ec mechanisms , fossati et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and ghisellini et al .",
    "( 1998 ; hereafter g98 ) constrained the physical parameters of a ( homogeneous ) emitting source .",
    "a few interesting clues emerged .",
    "the luminosity and sed of the sources appear to be connected , and a spectral sequence in which the energy of the two spectral components and the relative intensity decrease with source power seems to characterise blazars , from low power bl lacs to powerful fsrqs ( opposite claims have been put forward by giommi et al . 2007 ;",
    "see also padovani 2006 ) .",
    "this sed sequence translates into an ( inverse ) correlation between the energy of particles emitting at the spectral peaks and the energy density in magnetic and radiation fields ( ghisellini , celotti & costamante 2002 ; hereafter g02 ) .",
    "an interpretation of such findings is possible within the internal shock scenario ( ghisellini 1999 ; spada et al .",
    "2001 ; guetta et al 2004 ) , which could account for the radiative efficiency , location of the dissipative region and spectral trend if the particle acceleration process is balanced by the radiative cooling .",
    "in such a scenario the energetics on scales of 10@xmath3 schwarzschild radii is dominated by the power associated to the bulk motion of plasma .",
    "this is in contrast with an electromagnetically dominated flow ( blandford 2002 ; lyutikov & blandford 2003 ) .    within the frame of the same ssc and ec emission model , in this work we consider the implications on the jet energetics , the form in which the energy is transported and possibly the plasma composition .",
    "in particular we estimate the ( minimum ) power which is carried by the emitting plasma in electromagnetic and kinetic form in a significant sample of blazars at the scale where the @xmath0ray emission  and hence most of the luminosity  is produced .",
    "such scale corresponds to a distance from the black hole of the order of @xmath4 cm ( ghisellini & madau 1996 ) , a factor 10100 smaller than the vlbi one .",
    "the found energetics are lower limits as they only consider the particles required to produce the observed radiation , and neglect ( cold ) electrons not contributing to the emission .    in section 2 the sample of sources",
    "is presented . in section 3",
    "we describe how the power in particles and field have been estimated , and the main assumptions of the radiative model adopted .",
    "the results are reported in section 4 and discussed in section 5 .",
    "preliminary and partial results concerning the power of blazar jets were presented in conference proceedings ( see e.g. ghisellini 1999 , celotti 2001 , ghisellini 2004 ) .",

    "the observational data were good enough to determine the location of the high energy peak , a crucial information to constrain the model input parameters .",
    "the total number of sources is 74 : 46 fsrqs and 28 bl lac objects , 14 of which are tev detected sources .",
    "the objects are listed in table 1 together with the input parameters of the model fit .",
    "as already mentioned and widely assumed , the infrared to @xmath0ray sed of these sources was interpreted in terms of a one  zone homogeneous model in which a single relativistic lepton population produces the low energy spectral component via the synchrotron process and the high energy one via the inverse compton mechanism .",
    "target photons for the inverse compton scattering comprise both synchrotron photons produced internally to the emitting region itself and photons produced by an external source , whose spectrum is represented by a diluted blackbody peaking at a ( comoving ) frequency @xmath11 hz .",
    "we refer to g02 for further details about the model .",
    "the emitting plasma is moving with velocity @xmath12 and bulk lorentz factor @xmath13 , at an angle @xmath14 with respect to the line of sight .",
    "the observed radiation is postulated to originate in a zone of the jet , described as a cylinder , with thickness @xmath15 as seen in the comoving frame , and volume @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 is the cross section radius of the jet .",
    "the emitting region contains the relativistic emitting leptons and ( possibly ) protons of comoving density @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively , embedded in a magnetic field of component @xmath20 perpendicular to the direction of motion , homogeneous and tangled throughout the region .",
    "the model fitting allows to infer the physical parameters of the emitting region , namely its size and beaming factor , and of the emitting plasma , i.e. @xmath18 and @xmath20 .",
    "these quantities translate into jet kinetic powers and poynting flux .    assuming one proton per relativistic emitting electron and protons ` cold ' in the comoving frame , the proton kinetic power corresponds to @xmath21 while relativistic leptons contribute to the kinetic power as : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the average random lorentz factor of the leptons , measured in the comoving frame , and @xmath24 , @xmath25 are the proton and electron rest masses , respectively .",
    "the power carried as poynting flux is given by @xmath26 the observed synchrotron and self  compton luminosities @xmath27 are related to the comoving luminosities @xmath28 ( assumed to be isotropic in this frame ) by @xmath29 , where the relativistic doppler factor @xmath30^{-1}$ ] .",
    "the ec luminosity , instead , has a different dependence on @xmath14 , being anisotropic in the comoving frame , with a boosting factor @xmath31 ( dermer 1995 ) .",
    "the latter coincides to that of the synchrotron and self  compton radiation for @xmath32 i.e. when the viewing angle is @xmath33 . for simplicity",
    ", we adopt a @xmath34 boosting for all emission components .",
    "besides the jet powers corresponding to protons , leptons and magnetic field flowing in the jet , there is also an analogous component associated to radiation , corresponding to : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the radiation energy density measured in the comoving frame .",
    "we refer to g02 for a detailed discussion on the general robustness and uniqueness of the values which are inferred from the modelling . here",
    "we only briefly recall the main assumptions of this approach .",
    "the relativistic particles are assumed to be injected throughout the emitting volume for a finite time @xmath37 .",
    "since blazars are variable ( flaring ) sources , a reasonably good representation of the observed spectrum can be obtained by considering the particle distribution at the end of the injection , at @xmath38 , when the emitted luminosity is maximised . in this respect",
    "therefore the powers estimated refer to _ flaring states _ of the considered blazars and do not necessarily represent average values .    as the injection lasts for a finite timescale",
    ", only the higher energy particles have time to cool ( i.e. @xmath39 ) .",
    "the particle distribution @xmath40 can be described as a broken power ",
    "law with the injection slope below @xmath41 and steeper above it .",
    "we adopt a particle distribution @xmath40 that corresponds to injecting a broken power ",
    "law with slopes @xmath42 and @xmath43 below and above the break at @xmath44 .",
    "thus the resulting shape of @xmath40 depends on 1 ) the injected distribution and 2 ) the cooling time with respect to @xmath45 .    the limiting cases in relation to 2 )",
    "can be identified with powerful fsrqs and low power bl lacs .",
    "for fsrqs the cooling time is shorter than @xmath45 for all particle energies ( fast cooling regime ) and therefore the resulting @xmath40 is a broken power ",
    "law with a break at @xmath44 , the energy of the leptons emitting most of the observed radiation , i.e. @xmath46 for low power bl lacs only the highest energy leptons can cool in @xmath45 ( slow cooling regime ) , and if the cooling energy ( in @xmath45 ) is @xmath47 ( @xmath48 is the highest energy of the injected leptons ) , we have : @xmath49 for intermediate cases the detailed @xmath40 is fully described in g02 .",
    "we examine here the influence of the most crucial assumptions on the estimated powers .    *",
    "* low energy cutoff  * a well known crucial parameter for the estimates of powers in particles , which is poorly fixed by the modelling , is the low energy distribution of the emitting leptons , parametrised via a minimum @xmath50 ( i.e. for say @xmath51 )",
    ". indeed particles of such low energies ( if present ) would not contribute to the observed synchrotron spectrum , since they emit self  absorbed radiation .",
    "they would instead contribute to the low energy part of the inverse compton spectrum , but : i ) in the case of ssc emission , their contribution is dominated by the synchrotron luminosity of higher energy leptons ; ii ) in the case of ec emission their radiation could be masked by the ssc ( again produced by higher energy leptons ) or by contributions from other parts of the jet .",
    "+ however in very powerful sources there are indications that the ec emission dominates in the x  ray range and thus the observations provide an upper limit to @xmath50 . in such sources",
    "there is direct spectral evidence that @xmath50 is close to unity .",
    "[ 1127 ] illustrates this point .",
    "it can be seen how the model changes by assuming different @xmath50 : only when @xmath521 a good fit of the soft x ",
    "ray spectrum can be obtained .",
    "for such powerful blazars , the cooling time is short for leptons of all energies , ensuring that @xmath40 extends down at least to @xmath53 a few .",
    "the extrapolation of the distribution down to @xmath54 with a slope @xmath55 therefore implies that the possible associated error in calculating the number of leptons is @xmath56 .",
    "+ for low power bl lacs the value of @xmath50 is much more uncertain . in the majority of cases @xmath57 , and our extrapolation assuming again",
    "a @xmath55 slope translates in an uncertainty in the lepton number @xmath58 .",

    "variability timescales imply that @xmath63@xmath65@xmath17 .",
    "although there is no obvious lower limit to @xmath63 which can be inferred from observational constraints , the choice of a smaller @xmath66 can lead to an incorrect estimate of the observed flux , unless the different travel paths of photons originating in different parts of the source are properly taken into account . as illustrative case",
    "consider a source with @xmath67 : the photons reaching the observer are those leaving the source at 90@xmath68 from the jet axis ( in the comoving frame ) .",
    "assume also that the source emits in this frame for a time interval @xmath69 .",
    "if @xmath70 , then a ( comoving ) observer at 90@xmath68 can detect photons only from a ` slice ' of the source at any given time .",
    "only when @xmath71 the entire source can be seen ( chiaberge & ghisellini 1999 ) .",
    "this is the reason to assume @xmath72 . * * filling factor  * our derivations are based on the assumption of a single homogeneous emitting region .",
    "however it is not implausible to imagine that the emitting volume is inhomogeneous , with filaments and/or smaller clumps occupying only a fraction of the volume . how would this alter our estimates ? as illustrative case",
    "let us compare the parameters inferred from the sed modelling from a region of size @xmath17 with one filled by @xmath73 emitting clouds of typical dimension @xmath74 and density @xmath75 . as the synchrotron and compton peak frequencies determine univocally the value of the magnetic field , in order to model the sed the same field have to permeate the clumps .",
    "this in turn fixes the same total number of synchrotron emitting leptons .",
    "if the high energy component is due to ec the same spectrum is then produced , independently of the filling factor . in the case of a dominant ssc emission , instead , it is necessary to also require that the ensemble of clouds radiate the same total ssc spectrum , i.e. that each cloud has the same scattering optical depth of the whole homogeneous region ( i.e. @xmath76 ) .",
    "+ in both cases ( ssc and ec ) the kinetic power derived by fitting the sed is the same , but in the clumped scenario the required poynting flux can be less ( since in this case the same magnetic field permeates only the emitting clouds ) .",
    "this thus strengthens our conclusions on the relative importance of @xmath77 and @xmath78 at least in the case of bl lacs .",
    "the model fitting allowed us to derive the intrinsic physical parameters of the sources as described in section 3 .",

    "this follows the fact that the @xmath0ray luminosity in the latter objects is of the same order ( or even larger ) than the synchrotron one and for almost all sources the relevant radiation mechanism is ssc , without a significant contribution from external radiation .",
    "if the self  compton process occurred in the thomson regime then @xmath112 , but often the synchrotron seed photons for the ssc process have high enough energies ( uv / x  rays ) that the scattering process is in the klein ",
    "nishina regime : this implies @xmath113 even for comparable compton and synchrotron luminosities .",
    "this result is rather robust indicating that also in bl lacs the inferred poynting luminosity can not account for the radiated power on the scales where most of it is produced .",
    "since @xmath114 , relativistic leptons can not be the primary energy carriers as they have to be accelerated in the radiating zone  since they would otherwise efficiently cool in the more compact inner jet region  at the expenses of another form of energy .",
    "as before , two the possibilities for the energy reservoir : a cold leptonic component or hadrons .",
    "the required cold e@xmath1 density is again 10@xmath115@xmath116 times that in the relativistic population .",
    "compared to fsrqs , bl lacs have smaller jet powers and external photon densities .",
    "cold e@xmath1 could actually survive annihilation and not suffer significantly of compton drag , if the accretion disk is radiatively inefficient .",
    "for the same reason , these cold pairs would not produce much bulk compton radiation ( expected in the x  ray band or even at higher energies if the accretion disk luminosity peaks in the x  rays ) .",
    "still the issue of producing these cold pairs in the first place constitutes a problem .",
    "photon processes are not efficient in rarefied plasmas , while photon ",
    "photon interactions require a large compactness at @xmath2mev energies , where the sed of bl lacs appears to have a minimum ( although observations in this band do not have high sensitivity ) .",
    "alternatively , also in bl lacs the bulk energy of hadrons might constitute the energy reservoir .",
    "even so , one proton per relativistic lepton provides sometimes barely enough power , since the average random lorentz factor of emitting leptons in tev sources is close to @xmath94 ( see fig .",
    "[ lr_vs_all ] ) .",
    "this implies either that only a fraction of leptons are accelerated to relativistic energies ( corresponding to @xmath60 larger than what estimated above ) , or that tev sources radiatively dissipate most of the jet power .",
    "if so , their jets have to decelerate .",
    "such option receives support from vlbi observations showing , in tev bl lacs , sub  luminal proper motion ( e.g. edwards & piner 2002 ; piner & edwards 2004 ) . and indeed models accounting for the deceleration via radiative dissipation have been proposed , by e.g. georganopoulos & kazanas ( 2003 ) and ghisellini , tavecchio & chiaberge ( 2005 ) .",
    "the latter authors postulate a spine / layer jet structure that can lead , by the compton rocket effect , to effective deceleration even assuming the presence of a proton per relativistic lepton . while these models are more complex than what assumed here it should be stressed that the physical parameters inferred in their frameworks do not alter the scenario illustrated here ( in these models the derived magnetic field can be larger , but the corresponding poynting flux does not dominate the energetics ) .",
    "the simplest option is thus that also for low luminosity blazars the jet power is dominated by the contribution due to the bulk motion of protons , with the possibility that in these sources a significant fraction of it is efficiently transferred to leptons and radiated away .",
    "-0.5true cm -2.5 true cm -0.7 true cm      the dependence of the radiative regime on the source power can be highlighted by directly considering the random lorentz factor @xmath117 of leptons responsible for both peaks of the emission ( synchrotron and inverse compton components ) as a function of the comoving energy density @xmath118 ( top panel of fig .",
    "@xmath119 corresponds to the fraction of the total radiation energy density available for compton scattering in the thomson regime . in powerful blazars",
    "this coincides with the energy density of synchrotron and broad line photons , while in tev bl lacs it is a fraction of the synchrotron radiation .",
    "the figure illustrates one of the key features of the blazar sequence , offering an explanation of the phenomenological trend between the observed bolometric luminosity and the sed of blazars , as presented in fossati et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and discussed in g98 and g02 .",
    "the inclusion here of tev bl lacs confirms and extends the @xmath117@xmath120 relation towards high @xmath117 ( low @xmath120 ) .",
    "the sequence appears to comprise two branches : the high @xmath117 branch can be described as @xmath121 , while below @xmath122 the relation seems more scattered , with objects still following the above trend and others following a flatter one , @xmath123 .",
    "the steep branch can be interpreted in terms of radiative cooling : when @xmath124 , the particle distribution presents two breaks : below @xmath44 @xmath125 , between @xmath44 and @xmath41 @xmath126 ( which is the slope of the injected distribution @xmath127 ) , and above @xmath41 @xmath128 . consequently , for @xmath129 , the resulting synchrotron and inverse compton spectral peaks are radiated by leptons with @xmath130 given by : @xmath131 thus accounting for the steeper correlation .",
    "the scatter around the correlation is due to different values of @xmath63 and to sources requiring @xmath132 , for which @xmath133 ( see table 1 ) .    when @xmath134 , instead , all of the injected leptons cool in the time @xmath135 .",
    "if @xmath129 , @xmath117 coincides with @xmath44 , while it is still equal to @xmath41 when @xmath132 .",
    "this explains why part of the sources still follow the @xmath121 relation also for small values of @xmath117 .",
    "the physical interpretation of the @xmath123 branch is instead more complex , since in this case @xmath136 , which is a free parameter of the model .",
    "as discussed in g02 , one possibility is that @xmath44 corresponds to a pre  injection phase ( as envisaged for internal shocks in gamma  ray bursts ) . during such phase leptons",
    "would be heated up to energies at which heating and radiative cooling balance .",
    "if the acceleration mechanism is independent of @xmath120 and @xmath0 , the equilibrium is reached at lorentz factors @xmath137 , giving raise to the flatter branch .",
    "the trend of a stronger radiative cooling reducing the value of @xmath117 in more powerful jets is confirmed by considering the direct dependence of @xmath117 on the total jet power @xmath138 .",
    "this is reported in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "the correlation approximately follows the trend @xmath139 and has a scatter comparable to that of the @xmath117@xmath120 relation .",
    "the inferred jet powers and the above considerations supporting the dominant role of @xmath60 allow to estimate a mass outflow rate , @xmath140 , corresponding to flaring states of the sources , from @xmath141 a key physical parameter is given by the ratio between @xmath140 and the mass accretion rate , @xmath142 , that can be derived by the accretion disk luminosity : @xmath143 , where @xmath144 is the radiative efficiency : @xmath145 rawlings & saunders ( 1991 ) argued that the average jet power required to energise radio lobes is of the same order of the accretion disk luminosity as estimated from the narrow lines emitted following photoionization ( see also celotti , padovani , & ghisellini 1997 who considered broad lines to infer the disc emission ) . here",
    "jet powers in general larger than the accretion disk luminosity have been instead inferred : for powerful blazars with broad emission lines the estimated ratio @xmath146 is of order 10100 ( see table 2 ) . as in these systems",
    "typically @xmath147 and for accretion efficiencies @xmath148 , inflow and outflow mass rates appear to be comparable during flares .    a challenge for the @xmath0ray satellite glast will be to reveal whether low  quiescent states of activity correspond to episodes of lower radiative efficiency or reduced @xmath60 and in the latter case to distinguish if a lower @xmath60 is predominantly determined by a lower @xmath140 or @xmath13 .",
    "* the estimated jet powers often exceed the power radiated by accretion , which can be derived directly for the most powerful sources , whose synchrotron spectrum peaks in the far ir , and via the luminosity of the broad emission lines in less powerful fsrqs ( see e.g. celotti , padovani & ghisellini 1997 ; maraschi & tavecchio 2003 ) . * for powerful blazars ( i.e. fsrqs )",
    "the radiated luminosity is in some cases larger than the power carried in the relativistic leptons responsible for the emission . * also",
    "the values of the poynting flux are statistically lower than the radiated power .",
    "this directly follows from the dominance of the compton over the synchrotron emission . *",
    "if there is a proton for each emitting electron , the kinetic power associated to the bulk motion in fsrqs is a factor 1050 larger than the radiated one , i.e. corresponding to efficiencies of 210 per cent .",
    "this is consistent with a significant fraction being able to energise radio lobes .",
    "the proton component has to be energetically dominant ( only a few electron  positron pairs per proton are allowed ) unless the magnetic field present in the emitting region is only a fraction of the poynting flux associated to jets . * for low power bl lacs",
    "the power in relativistic leptons is comparable to the emitted one .",
    "nevertheless , an additional reservoir of energy is needed to accelerate them to high energies .",
    "this can not be the poynting flux , that again appears to be insufficient . *",
    "the contribution from kinetic energy of protons is an obvious candidate , but since the average random lorentz factors of leptons can be as high as @xmath149 in tev sources , one proton per emitting electrons yields @xmath150 . *",
    "this suggests that either only a fraction of leptons are accelerated to relativistic energies or that jets dissipate most of their bulk power into radiation . in the latter case",
    "they should decelerate . *",
    "the jet power ( inversely ) correlates with the energy of the leptons emitting at the peak frequencies of the blazar seds .",
    "this indicates that radiative cooling is most effective in more powerful jets .",
    "* the need for a dynamically dominant proton component in blazars allows to estimate the mass outflow rate @xmath140 .",
    "this reaches , during flares , values comparable to the mass accretion rate .",
    "the first important result emerging from this work is that the power of extragalactic jets is large in comparison to that emitted via accretion .",
    "this result is rather robust , since the uncertainties related to the particular model adopted are not crucial : the finding follows from a comparison with the emitted luminosity , which is a rather model  independent quantity , relying only on the estimate of the bulk lorentz factor .",
    "the findings about the kinetic and poynting powers instead depend on the specific modelling of the blazar seds as synchrotron and inverse compton emission from a one  zone homogeneous region .",
    "hadronic models may yield different results .",
    "furthermore , the estimated power associated to the proton bulk motion relies also on the amount of ` cold ' ( non emitting ) electron  positron pairs in the jet .",
    "we have argued that if pairs had to be dynamically relevant their density at the jet base would make annihilation unavoidable . however",
    "the presence of a few pairs per proton can not be excluded . if there were no electron ",
    "positron pairs , the inferred jet powers are 10100 times larger than the disk accretion luminosity , in agreement with earlier claims based on individual sources or smaller blazar samples ( ghisellini 1999 ; celotti 2001 ; maraschi & tavecchio 2003 ; sambruna et al .",
    "such large powers are needed in order to energise the emitting leptons at the ( @xmath0ray ) jet scale and the radio  lobes hundreds of kpc away .",
    "the finding that blazar jets are not magnetically dominated is also quite robust , but only in the context of the ( widely accepted ) framework of the synchrotron ",
    "inverse compton emission model . in this scenario",
    "the dominance of the high energy ( inverse compton ) component with respect to the synchrotron one limits the magnetic field .",
    "this is at odd with magnetically driven jet acceleration , though this appears to be the most viable possibility . in blazars",
    "thermally driven acceleration , as invoked in gamma ",
    "ray bursts , does not appear to be possible .",
    "in gamma - ray bursts the initial fireball is highly opaque to electron scattering and this allows the conversion of the trapped radiation energy into bulk motion ( see e.g. meszaros 2006 for a recent review ) . in blazars",
    "the scattering optical depths at the base of the jet are around unity at most , and even invoking the presence of electron  positron pairs to increase the opacity is limited by the fact that they quickly annihilate .",
    "thus , if magnetic fields play a crucial role our results would require that magnetic acceleration must be rapid , since at the scale of a few hundreds schwarzschild radii , where most of radiation is produced , the poynting flux is no longer energetically dominant ( confirming the results by sikora et al .",
    ". however models of magnetically accelerated flows indicate that the process is actually relatively slow ( e.g. li , chiueh & begelman 1992 , begelman & li 1994 ) .",
    "apparently the only possibility is that the jet structure is more complex than what assumed and a possibly large scale , stronger field does not pervade the dissipation region , as also postulated in pure electromagnetic scenarios ( see e.g. blandford 2002 , lyutikov & blandford 2003 ) .",
    "the third relevant results refers the difference between fsrqs and bl lacs .",
    "this concerns not only their jet powers but also the relative role of protons in their jets .",
    "bl lacs would be more dissipative and therefore their jets should decelerate .",
    "this inference depends on assuming one proton per emitting lepton also in these sources , and this is rather uncertain ( i.e. there could be more than one proton per relativistic , emitting electron ) . if true , it can provide an explanation to why vlbi knots of low power bl lacs are moving sub - luminally and in turn account for the different radio morphology of fr i and fr ii radio  galaxies , since low power bl lacs are associated to fr i sources .",
