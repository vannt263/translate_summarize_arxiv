    "spatial solitons are nonlinear localized states that keep their form during propagation due to the balance between diffraction and self - induced nonlinear potential @xcite .",

    ", it has been shown that a spatially nonlocal nonlinear response provides stabilization of various complex solitonic structures including vortices  @xcite .",
    "consequently , azimuthons and their dynamics have been studied almost exclusively in the context of spatially nonlocal nonlinear media  @xcite . in spite of the fact that there are various physical settings exhibiting nonlocality such as nematic liquid crystals @xcite , bose - einstein condensates @xcite , plasmas @xcite , thermo - optical materials @xcite etc .",
    ", experimental realization of such systems is always quite involved .",
    "moreover , from the theoretical point of view , nonlocal media are quite challenging for numerical modeling and analytical treatment .    in this paper",
    "we propose a much simpler and experimentally accessible optical system to study the propagation of azimuthons : a weakly nonlinear optical multi - mode waveguide . here , weakly nonlinear means that the nonlinear induced index change , which is proportional to the intensity of the optical beam , is small compared to the index profile ( or trapping potential ) of the waveguide .",
    "following @xcite , we can expect that weakly nonlinear azimuthons are stable in multi - mode waveguides .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "this damage threshold is @xmath30 times higher , but since we consider `` cw '' beams the lower value for nanosecond pulses is relevant .",
