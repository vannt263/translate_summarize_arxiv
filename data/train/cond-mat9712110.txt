    "the study of correlations and structure factors provides a sensitive probe into the characteristics of collective behavior in many - particle systems .",
    "for example , in a system with short range microscopic interactions , maintained in thermal equilibrium , spatial correlations will in general decay exponentially .",
    "long - range spatial correlations , characterized by power laws , are observed only if the system is at a critical point .",
    "in contrast , when such systems are driven into non - equilibrium steady states , long - range correlations are often present in large regions of the phase diagram @xcite .",
    "a model system in which such anomalous correlations are easily observed and studied is the _ driven _ ising lattice gas ( the `` standard model '' ) @xcite .",
    "the drive ( `` external field '' ) biases particle jumps along a specific lattice axis , thus forcing the system into a non - equilibrium steady state .",
    "one of the most intriguing and unexpected features of this system is the presence of long - range spatial correlations _ at all temperatures _ above criticality , due to the breakdown of the traditional fluctuation - dissipation relations @xcite in conjunction with a conservation law for the particle density . in momentum space ,",
    "the structure factor develops a discontinuity singularity at the origin @xcite .    in experiments ,",
    "correlations are typically studied by photon , electron or neutron beam scattering techniques .",
    "the scattering intensity is closely related to the structure factor .",
    "depending on the actual physical system , this quantity is the fourier transform of the `` density - density '' correlations , where , e.g. , in a ferromagnetic system `` density '' stands for the local magnetization . even in the stationary case , i.e. , when the averages are not expected to be time - dependent , the densities themselves are fluctuating quantities in both _ space and time_. thus , when data are taken , it is crucial to compare the time scale of these fluctuations to the duration of a typical `` snap - shot '' .",
    "if the former is much shorter than the sampling time interval , then even one measurement practically results in a temporal average . in this case , the scattering intensity is a direct measure of the _ average _ structure factor . in the opposite scenario each individual snap shot appears as a random pattern of speckles . the collection of many snap shots , however , represents the full distribution of the fluctuating density - density products .",
    "this phenomenon has long been known in laser scattering experiments and the statistical properties of the random speckles are well established @xcite .",
    "using monte carlo simulations , it is particularly easy to probe fluctuating quantities in terms of the their distributions : each measurement corresponds to one configuration at a certain instant of time so that there are no `` experimental '' difficulties in achieving fine sampling . since driven lattice gases exhibit generically singular density - density correlations ,",
    "a study of the associated distributions is expected to be particularly interesting .    in this paper , we will focus on a generalization of the standard model , similar in spirit to the one leading from the ising model to spin-1 @xcite or potts @xcite models . instead of just a single species of particles , we now consider two ( labelled as @xmath0 s and @xmath1 s ) which are driven in opposite directions , subject to periodic boundary conditions .",
    "empty lattice sites are referred to as holes .",
    "this generalization is motivated by a variety of physical systems , ranging from fast ionic conductors with several mobile ion species @xcite and water droplets in microemulsions with distinct charges @xcite to gel electrophoresis @xcite and traffic flow @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we neglect the usual ising nearest neighbor interaction and retain `` only '' the excluded volume constraint .",
    "the model thus corresponds to the high - temperature , large - drive limit of a more complicated interacting system .",
    "this multi - species model , in both one and two dimensions , has been studied in detail @xcite . in its simplest version ,",
    "particles are allowed to exchange with holes only .",
    "monte carlo simulations @xcite in two dimensions and mean - field studies @xcite show that there is a transition , controlled by particle density and drive , from a spatially homogeneous ( disordered ) phase to a charge segregated one , where the excluded volume constraint leads to the mutual blocking of particles . in this paper",
    "we extend our previous studies on structure factors@xcite and their distributions @xcite to the more general case where the particles are also allowed to exchange amongst themselves : we `` soften '' the excluded volume constraint by allowing exchanges of nearest neighbor , oppositely charged particles on a time scale @xmath2 which is distinct from that of the particle - hole exchange @xcite . here , the blocking transition still occurs , as part of a more complex phase diagram @xcite .",
    "a particularly interesting case emerges when the two time scales are chosen to be equal , i.e. , @xmath3 : here , _",
    "equal _ charges are completely uncorrelated ( up to trivial finite - size effects ) while `` hidden '' , non - trivial correlations survive between _ opposite _ charges .",
    "we add that this model in one dimension , at infinite drive and for arbitrary @xmath2 , has been solved exactly by godrche and sandow @xcite .",
    "we will focus on the disordered phase of the system , where we have a sound analytic understanding of the dynamics in terms of langevin equations .",
    "we will study not only the averages but also the full distributions of the steady - state structure factors , using monte carlo simulations and a continuum field theory .",
    "finding excellent agreement between our simulations and analytic results , we can trace the characteristics of the distributions back to the structure of the underlying langevin equations . given these relations ,",
    "measurements of structure factor distributions in real systems should provide considerable information about the associated dynamics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we define the microscopic model and give some details of the simulations . in section iii , we introduce the underlying langevin equations and calculate the average structure factors , the corresponding spatial correlations , and the theoretical distributions of the structure factors . in the final section ,",
    "we discuss our results and conclude with a brief summary .",
    "we consider a two dimensional fully periodic lattice with @xmath4 sites , each of which can be empty or occupied by a _",
    "single _ particle . to account for the presence of two species , we introduce two occupation numbers @xmath5 and @xmath6 , with @xmath7 being 0 or 1 , depending on whether a positive or negative particle is present at site @xmath8",
    ". the excluded volume constraint implies , for any @xmath8 . to model the system at zero total charge , we choose , i.e. , the average densities of positive and negative particles are the same : @xmath9 since the dynamics conserves both densities separately , @xmath10 is a constant . in the absence of the drive ,",
    "the two species of particles are distinguished only by their label : both types hop randomly to nearest - neighbor empty sites , with the same rate @xmath11 . in addition , nearest neighbor pairs of opposite charges exchange with a rate @xmath12 .",
    "the external drive is directed along a specific lattice axis , labelled as the @xmath13-direction .",
    "reminiscent of a uniform `` electric '' field @xmath14 , it exponentially suppresses jumps _ against _ the force .",
    "specifically , during one monte carlo step @xmath15 nearest - neighbor bonds are selected at random .",
    "if a particle - hole pair is encountered , an exchange takes place with probability @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the charge of the particle and @xmath18 is the change of the @xmath19 coordinate of the particle due to the jump .",
    "similarly , if the neighboring sites are occupied by opposite charges , a particle - particle exchange ( or charge transfer ) is attempted with probability @xmath20 where now @xmath21 is the change in the @xmath19 coordinate of the _ positive _ particle due to the jump .",
    "note that we do not introduce a factor of @xmath22 in the exponential here , as one might have expected for a real electric field .",
    "this choice leads to a simpler langevin equation without significantly affecting the phase diagram .",
    "needless to say , it is irrelevant whether exchange takes place or not , if both sites carry identical content .    for our simulations ,",
    "we set , so the control parameters are @xmath10 , @xmath14 and @xmath2 . on lattices with @xmath23 ranging from @xmath24 to @xmath25 ,",
    "the system is initialized with random configurations of various particle densities",
    ". runs last from @xmath26 to @xmath27 mcs .",
    "the first @xmath28 mcs are discarded to allow the system to settle into steady state .",
    "then , we measure the fourier transforms of @xmath29 every @xmath30 mcs , defining them in the usual way : @xmath31 in the following , we will investigate _ equal - time _ density - density operators in momentum space , considering both their full distributions as well as their ( ensemble or time ) averages . in the literature ,",
    "the term `` structure factor '' typically refers to the averages , i.e. , @xmath32 where @xmath33 ; @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the volume . occasionally , especially when discussing the full distributions , we will use the word `` structure factor '' for the fluctuating two - point operator itself . in the disordered phase ,",
    "@xmath36 is the fourier transform of the usual equal - time correlation function @xmath37 thus , if @xmath38 is even in @xmath8 , @xmath39 will be real , so that an imaginary part of @xmath39 signals a part of @xmath38 which is odd in @xmath8 . by charge symmetry",
    ", we expect @xmath40",
    ". clearly , both must be even in @xmath8 , so that the associated @xmath39 s are real .",
    "on other hand , we have @xmath41 in the presence of the drive so that @xmath42 may have an imaginary part ( which must be odd in @xmath14 ) .",
    "finally , @xmath43 follows from ( [ def ] ) by translation invariance . turning to the full distributions ,",
    "these can be constructed from the time series of @xmath44 , @xmath45}{v}$ ] and @xmath46}{v}$ ] in the steady state . exploiting symmetries again ,",
    "we note that @xmath47 and @xmath48 are distributed identically , so that we need to consider only the former .",
    "further , only @xmath49 and @xmath50 are necessarily real , while @xmath51 will generically be complex .    we simulate systems with @xmath2 ranging from @xmath52 to @xmath53 . for small @xmath54",
    "s we choose @xmath14 and the density @xmath10 in such a way that the system is in the homogeneous phase . for larger @xmath2 s ( @xmath55 ) the charge exchange mechanism suppresses the ordered phase entirely @xcite so we can pick arbitrarily large fields at any density .",
    "a particularly interesting case occurs for @xmath3 . here ,",
    "the rates for particle - hole and particle - particle exchanges become equal , i.e. , @xmath56 , so that a positive ( negative ) particle can no longer distinguish a negative ( positive ) one from a hole .",
    "thus , a positive ( negative ) particle experiences biased diffusion , slowed only by encounters with other positive ( negative ) particles , just as in the case of a single , non - interacting species , whose steady state probability distribution of configurations ( i.e. , the steady state solution of the associated master equation ) is exactly known to be uniform @xcite . for our case , this implies that the _ marginal _ distribution of the occupation numbers of one species is uniform , i.e. , @xmath57 = \\sum_{\\{n_{{\\bf x}}^{\\mp } \\}}p\\left [ \\{n_{{\\bf x}}^{+},n_{{\\bf x}% } ^{-}\\}\\right ] \\propto 1.$ ] thus , we expect questions regarding only one species of particles to have trivial answers , e.g. @xmath58 must vanish for @xmath59 in an infinite system or yield the finite - size fluctuations in a finite one . on the other hand , the two - point function between opposite charges can display interesting structures , e.g. long - range correlations , as a result of the full distribution @xmath60 $ ] not being uniform .",
    "we note briefly that a completely `` flat '' steady state , @xmath61 \\propto 1 $ ] , is obtained for @xmath62 , as in the one - dimensional version of our model @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we present the results for the three independent @xmath39 s found in the @xmath63 system at a small value of @xmath2 and note the discontinuity singularity of these objects at the origin . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we show the same quantities for @xmath3 and draw special attention to the fact that , while @xmath64 does not depend on @xmath65 at all , @xmath42 exhibits a highly nontrivial @xmath65-dependence .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] present the structure factor distributions for the smallest longitudinal and transverse wave vectors , respectively . before discussing the data in detail",
    ", we will first present the theoretical framework within which they can be understood .",
    "in particular , we will focus on two points , namely first , the emergence of discontinuity singularities in the structure factors at @xmath66 , and their consequences for long - range correlations in real space , and second , the origin of the asymmetric exponential form of the distributions .",
    "this will then be followed by a comparison between our theoretical predictions and the simulations .",
    "to extract the behavior at large distances ( or small @xmath67 in momentum space ) , a continuum field theory for the slow variables of the model is most appropriate . to find such a description",
    ", we must ( i ) identify the slow variables of the theory , and ( ii ) obtain a set of equations of motion for these quantities , corresponding to a coarse - grained version of the microscopic dynamics . for generality , we consider the @xmath68-dimensional case when @xmath69 is directed along the electric field and @xmath70 is in the ( @xmath71)-dimensional subspace , perpendicular to the field .",
    "time is denoted by @xmath72 .",
    "then , the slow variables are easily identified as the conserved densities , @xmath73 , of the two species .",
    "the most systematic way to arrive at their equations of motion is to perform an @xmath74-expansion @xcite : after partitioning the whole system into sufficiently large blocks of size @xmath74 , one splits the particle densities associated with the block centered at @xmath75 into a macroscopic part ( @xmath76 ) and a fluctuating one ( @xmath77 ) : @xmath78 this decomposition is inserted into the microscopic master equation , followed by a systematic expansion in @xmath74 . at leading order",

    "note that at the mean - field level we also obtain explicit expressions for the diffusion matrix and the bias @xcite : , and .",
    "of course , these may be modified by renormalization .",
    "the continuity equation ( [ meaf ] ) admits both homogeneous and inhomogeneous @xmath72-independent solutions , associated with the disordered and the blocked phases .",
    "the former is our focus here . to ease comparison with simulation data , we choose equal densities for both species : @xmath88 .",
    "this solution describes the steady state at the mean - field level .    at the next order in the @xmath74-expansion",
    ", we find a fokker - planck equation for the fluctuating part , @xmath89 .",
    "for our purposes , the equivalent langevin equation is more transparent . at this order ,",
    "its deterministic part is linear and the ( conserved ) noise is gaussian . after defining the `` reduced '' average density @xmath90 and @xmath91 , and focusing on the fluctuations about the homogeneous phase ,",

    "so far , we have focused entirely on the _ averages _ of density - density operators . in this final section",
    ", we will construct the full _ probability distributions _ for these fluctuating quantities , i.e. , @xmath202 , @xmath203}{v}$ ] and @xmath204}{v}$ ] , following the method of ref .",
    "@xcite . representing these operators by @xmath205 , @xmath206 and @xmath207",
    ", we seek their marginal distributions , for each @xmath65-vector separately : @xmath208}{v}-s_{r}^{+-}\\right ) \\right\\rangle   \\label{prob_dist } \\\\",
    "p_{i}^{+-}(s_{i}^{+-};{\\bf k } ) & = & \\left\\langle \\delta \\left ( \\frac{\\mbox{im}% [ \\chi ^{+}({\\bf k},t){\\chi ^{-}}^{*}({\\bf k},t)]}{v}-s_{i}^{+-}\\right ) \\right\\rangle",
    "\\;.   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , we have used @xmath209 , since the densities @xmath210 are real .",
    "also , we have normalized by @xmath211 in order to obtain a well - defined thermodynamic limit , noting that @xmath212 . in principle , these distributions can be computed explicitly , by inserting the solution @xmath213 of the langevin equation ( [ rsl ] ) into ( [ prob_dist ] ) and averaging over the noise , associated with ( [ noise ] ) .",
    "however , given that these distributions are universal @xcite , depending only on the linearity of the langevin equation and the gaussian nature of the noise , rather than on the specific forms of diffusion and noise matrices , ( [ det_matr ] ) and ( [ noisematr ] ) , a detailed calculation is not necessary .",
    "instead , we can refer to the distributions for a simpler case @xcite , namely the model without charge exchange , since their forms will be identical to the ones we are seeking here .",
    "however , some brief comments are in order , to put the results into perspective . for technical reasons",
    ", it is simpler to compute the characteristic functions ( i.e. , fourier transforms ) of ( [ prob_dist ] ) first . denoting these by @xmath214 , we find that @xmath215 has a single pole in the lower half @xmath74-plane , so that the inverse transform yields an exponential distribution for the non - negative variable @xmath205 : @xmath216 here",
    ", @xmath197 is just the _ average _ structure factor , and we will refer to @xmath217 as the `` decay factor '' of the exponential .",
    "in contrast , both @xmath218 and @xmath219 exhibit _ two _ poles , one ( @xmath220 ) being on the negative , and one ( @xmath221 ) on the positive imaginary axis , @xmath222\\mp   \\sqrt{\\delta + ( \\mbox{re}[s^{+-}({\\bf k})])^{2}}\\right ) \\text { \\ } \\label{param}\\ ] ] where @xmath223 .",
    "the inverse transforms also result in exponential distributions , characterized however by two distinct decay factors @xmath224 and @xmath225 : @xmath226 with @xmath227)^{2}}$ ] .",
    "the distribution of @xmath228}{v}$ ] , i.e. , @xmath229 , follows from @xmath230 by just interchanging @xmath231 $ ] and @xmath232 $ ] in eqs .",
    "( [ param],[pro+- ] ) .    to summarize , all three distributions are asymmetric exponentials , with @xmath233 representing the most extreme case .",
    "due to this structure , their standard deviations are always _ greater or equal _ than the averages , so that fluctuations will never be `` small '' , in the usual sense @xcite .",
    "finally , let us turn to comparisons with simulation results .",
    "typically , we find that power law tails are much more difficult to observe than in the single - species case @xcite .",
    "apparently , their amplitudes are rather small , so that the data are obscured by either critical singularities or finite size effects , depending on the points in the phase diagram which we choose to investigate .",
    "thus , we focus on the structure factors . using a standard least - square routine , we fitted our analytical results ( eqs .",
    "( [ scl_str ] ) and ( [ g1str ] ) before rescaling ) to our simulation data .",
    "the fit was done simultaneously for the three @xmath39 s using the smallest @xmath234 non - zero @xmath65 vectors .",
    "the agreement is quite good , especially considering that the theoretical results are based on a linearized langevin equation , but we note the following : for the @xmath235 case ( fig . [ fig1 ] ) , despite being in the homogeneous phase , the system was relatively close to the continuous transition @xcite , with corresponding to a correlation length in units of the lattice constant . in particular , `` longitudinal '' parameters , such as @xmath236 and the @xmath237 s , seem to suffer considerable renormalizations here . on the other hand , the `` transverse '' parameters ,",
    "@xmath238 and @xmath239 , appear to obey eqn .",
    "( [ fdt ] ) . in that sense",
    ", the fdt is satisfied _ within the transverse subspace_. to illustrate this feature , we combine ( [ fdt ] ) , written for the transverse parameters , with the explicit form of the structure factors ( [ exp_str ] ) for @xmath240 .",
    "this yields the exact `` finite size '' amplitudes , completely independent of @xmath241 : @xmath242 and @xmath243 , in perfect agreement with the simulations . in",
    "the _ full _",
    "@xmath68-dimensional space , however , the fdt is of course violated : as a result of the coarse - graining effect in the field direction , we generically found for the rescaled `` noise '' matrices .",
    "in particular we had , predicting the typical fdt - violating power law .    for @xmath244 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , @xmath197 is completely flat , as we expected , indicating that . moreover , the value of this constant is just @xmath245 , again consistent with ( [ fdt ] ) .",
    "in contrast , @xmath246 clearly exhibits the structure of eqs .",
    "( [ g1str ] ) . here",
    "the system is far from transitions ( @xmath247 ) , so that critical fluctuations are completely avoided .",
    "consequently , using with the mean - field parameters produces a `` mass '' closely matching the one obtained from the fit .",
    "now , we turn to a comparison of the analytical results for the structure factor distributions with the simulations , summarized in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] , for the two smallest wave vectors , respectively .",
    "the control parameters were the same as those of fig .",
    "again , the agreement between our gaussian theory and the data is quite impresssive .",
    "the ` @xmath194 ' histograms show simple exponential decay @xcite , while the ` @xmath248 ' histograms clearly represent asymmetric exponential distributions . to test the theoretical prediction , namely , that the slopes of the histograms are determined entirely by the structure factor averages , we simply measured the latter , i.e. , @xmath64 , @xmath249 and @xmath250 .",
    "we then inserted the _ measured _ averages into the _ theoretical _ relations for the decay factors .",
    "clearly , the ` @xmath194 ' case is particularly simple since the decay factor is just the inverse of @xmath64 itself . for the two @xmath248 distributions , the decay factors @xmath251 , given by ( [ param ] ) ,",
    "are considerably less trivial , but the agreement is nevertheless remarkable . here , renormalizations can obviously also occur , but can be absorbed into the effective parameters of the theory , leaving the _ form _ of the structure factor distributions invariant . moreover , they are automatically captured by the _ measured _ structure factors , so that they do not spoil the agreement between data and theory here",
    ". however , we must avoid critical fluctuations since these fall out of the scope of a linear theory .    in summary , using both simulations and analytic techniques , we have examined the structure factors in a simple model of biased diffusion of two species .",
    "we calculated the corresponding spatial correlations , finding not only the expected power law decay , @xmath177 , typical for non - equilibrium steady states of conserved systems in the presence of strong anisotropy , but also a _ novel _ power , @xmath179 , for correlations along the bias , characteristic for two - species models .",
    "we also investigated the full distribution functions for the structure factors , being universal asymmetric distributions .",
    "the general agreement between simulations and a gaussian field theory is surprisingly good , while we await a renormalization group analysis of the continuum theory of the model in order to make more detailed comparisons closer to the continuous transition .",
    "we thank r.k.p .",
    "zia , z. toroczkai and s. sandow for many stimulating discussions .",
    "this research is supported in part by grants from the national science foundation through the division of materials research .",
    "from eqn . ( [ scl_str ] ) we see that we need three basic type of integrals .",
    "although the first one is well known , we list it for completeness : @xmath252 then , if @xmath253 is diagonal and isotropic in the @xmath71 dimensional transverse subspace but not a multiple of the unit matrix , it is easy to compute @xmath254 next , we will outline a formal way to obtain the other two required momentum integrals . for a more rigorous treatment",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we define @xmath255 and @xmath256 as follows : @xmath257 it is then helpful to realize that the integrands , without the exponential factor , are simply the convolutions of two functions , i.e. : @xmath258 where @xmath259   \\label{ktr } \\\\",
    "s({\\bf k } ) & = & \\frac{(2\\pi ) ^{d}}{2}\\delta ( { \\bf k}_{\\perp } ) \\,\\left [ \\delta ( k_{\\parallel } + im)-\\delta ( k_{\\parallel } -im)\\right ] \\;.   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath198-functions with complex arguments should only be understood in an operational sense .",
    "the fourier inverse transforms of these functions are easily found : @xmath260 thus , using the convolution theorem , we trivially get @xmath261 note that @xmath262 is the solution of @xmath263 then using some algebra and ( [ basic ] ) , we can translate @xmath264 into differentiation with respect to @xmath19 : @xmath265 these forms are particularly useful when we calculate the corresponding long - distance behavior .",
    "to obtain the long - distance behavior for @xmath266 , we just have to omit the first term in ( [ de ] ) , which is a @xmath198-function : @xmath267 this is the typical `` fdt - violating '' power law , provided that @xmath195 is not a simple multiple of the unit matrix .",
    "otherwise , the amplitude of this term would be zero .    using the `` large @xmath268 '' asymptotic expansion of the modified besssel function @xcite @xmath269",
    "we can obtain the long - distance behavior for @xmath270 and @xmath271 as and . due to the strong anisotropies in these functions , we consider three different scenarios :    ( i. ) @xmath272 combining ( [ dfs ] ) and the asymptotic form of @xmath262 we find : @xmath273 while @xmath274 and @xmath275 are simply zero at @xmath276 , since they are odd functions of @xmath19 .",
    "thus , finally we have @xmath277    ( ii . ) @xmath278 in addition to using the asymptotic form of @xmath262 , we can now also write and . in the following",
    ", we will keep the second leading power in @xmath279 in order to simplify the discussion of case ( iii ) .",
    "we find @xmath280 thus , for @xmath281 we have in leading order : @xmath282    ( iii . ) @xmath283 note that ( [ f12xy ] ) was obtained exploiting only .",
    "setting has two important consequences : since now , the exponential decays cancel and , further , the amplitude of the @xmath284 term will vanish .",
    "invoking the next - to - leading terms in ( [ f12xy ] ) yields : @xmath285 which are the desired results .",
