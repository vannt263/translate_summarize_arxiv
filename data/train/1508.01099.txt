    "rich physics , such as the josephson effect@xcite , quantum coherence@xcite and quantum interference@xcite , arise when two coherent quantum systems are weakly coupled . some examples of systems that exhibit such physics are superconducting josephson junctions@xcite , the flow of superfluid @xmath4he through an array of nano - apertures@xcite , and the observation of the josephson effect in bose - einstein condensates@xcite .",
    "superconductors have traditionally held a special place as test - bench systems for these kinds of quantum phenomena due to the ease of scaling and integrating them into real quantum devices , offering a high degree of measurability and control of a macroscopic wave function .",
    "every experiment or application using a superconducting weak link is based on how the phase difference @xmath5 between the electrodes evolves in time and space@xcite .",
    "the large variety of barriers now available between the superconducting electrodes offer novel functionalities and efficient tuning of physical processes occurring at the nanoscale and at different interfaces@xcite .",
    "a recent example is the proposal to use the josephson effect for the detection of the majorana fermions@xcite .",
    "progress in material science in producing a larger variety of interfaces and in nanotechnologies applied to superconductivity , is promoting a rethinking of the phase dynamics of josephson junctions ( jjs ) . here",
    "we give evidence of a breakdown of a fundamental tenet of the josephson effect : the transition from the superconducting to the normal state does not follow the expected stochastic josephson phase dynamics , but has a more intriguing balance between local and global energy processes . the onset of non - equilibrium effects is the key to describe the local processes , which may radically change perspectives on how to interpret the physics and make predictions on the performances of a large variety of `` smart '' josephson devices .",
    "we measure switching current distributions ( scds ) which codify the very general process of the escape of a particle ( phase ) from a potential well in a jj@xcite , keeping track in our case of non - equilibrium effects . roughly speaking ,",
    "scds are obtained in jjs with hysteretic current - voltage ( i - v ) characteristics by counting the number of times the system switches from the superconducting to the resistive state within a small window of bias current , when ramping forth and back the bias current .",
    "thermally activated processes are well understood in jjs both in the underdamped@xcite and in the moderately damped@xcite regime .",
    "the transition to the macroscopic quantum tunneling regime has been theoretically@xcite and experimentally@xcite widely investigated .",
    "scd measurements focus on `` the very moment '' at which resistance originates in superconducting weak links .",
    "thus we use the power of encoding information of non - equilibrium local processes in fluctuations to characterize these dynamical processes .    in the resistively and",
    "capacitively shunted junction ( rcsj ) model@xcite , the damping parameter @xmath6 is proportional to the square root of @xmath7 via the plasma frequency @xmath8 at zero bias current , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the resistance and capacitance , respectively . in a more general approach",
    ", @xmath11 has a frequency dependence@xcite , which includes the effects of the external shunting impedance .",
    "a junction can not sustain an unlimited increase in the critical current @xmath7 and thus in the quality factor @xmath11 through larger critical current density @xmath0 while still preserving all the properties of the josephson effect and all the features of the underdamped regime in the i - v curves .",
    "the breakdown of the josephson dynamics is found at higher values of the critical current density .",
    "the classical josephson phase dynamics , which takes place in junctions characterized by lower critical current densities @xmath0 , are replaced at high @xmath0 values by a regime driven by non - equilibrium dynamics where phase information is lost .",
    "non - equilibrium effects produce hysteretic i - v characteristics and modify the influence of dissipation , thus becoming measurable through modeling of the scd in terms of heating modes .",
    "the heating modes follow a heat diffusion - type equation in analogy to phase slip events@xcite . in the present work , this transition from classical to non - equilibrium phase dynamics is found for high critical temperature superconductors ( hts ) grain boundary ( gb ) junctions , but should be expected for any kind of jjs@xcite .",
    "specific thresholds may depend on the type of junctions and materials , but the features of the transition are universal .",
    "hts gb junctions are the ideal system to identify this transition because of the possibility of varying the critical supercurrent density @xmath0 over a wide range of values@xcite .",
    "yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 ( ybco ) off axis biepitaxial gb junctions provide a large variety of transport regimes because of d - wave order parameter effects as well as the modulation of the barrier transparency through different relative orientation of the electrodes@xcite .",
    "details on the preparation and properties of the gb junctions used in this work are given in refs .",
    "we present here data from junctions ( jct ) with low ( jct a ) , intermediate ( jct b ) and high ( jct c ) values of @xmath0 . for each junction @xmath0",
    "has been determined as the ratio between the measured @xmath7 in the i - v curves and the geometrical area of the junction ( width @xmath12 thickness of the ybco film)@xcite . for jct",
    "c we have employed nanofabrication techniques to be in the appropriate range of @xmath7@xcite . to study their escape rates we have thermally anchored the samples to the mixing chamber of a he@xmath13/he@xmath4 oxford dilution refrigerator and performed measurements of scds .",
    "measurement procedures and filtering used in this experiment are described elsewhere@xcite .",
    "switching histograms of jcts a , b and c are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "the 3-d view gives an intuitive picture : scds cover distinct current ranges , and when @xmath0 increases , they become broader . in the right part of the figure ,",
    "each set of scds is displayed with appropriate scales for a better view of the details of their temperature dependence . in fig .",
    "[ figure1]e the escape rate @xmath14 out of the zero - voltage state as a function of the bias current @xmath15 has been plotted for jct c in the same temperature range .",
    "@xmath16 curves have been computed from the scds following fulton and dunkleberger @xcite .",
    "the standard deviation @xmath17 of the histograms is reported for all junctions in fig .",
    "[ figure2]a .",
    "the combined analysis of @xmath17 , of the skewness @xmath18 ( @xmath19 being the third central moment of the distribution ) , and of their temperature evolution characterize the phase dynamics .    the histograms from jcts a and b match well the predictions of the rcsj model for moderately damped jjs .",
    "low values of @xmath7@xcite , especially in hts d - wave junctions , where intrinsic sources contribute to dissipation@xcite , lead to the moderately damped ( md ) regime ( @xmath20 ) . in the md regime the scds become narrower with increasing temperature for temperatures above @xmath21 , which is defined as the temperature at which @xmath22 is largest ( in the case of jct b @xmath21 is about 1.0 k ) .",
    "this is often reported in the literature as the phase diffusion ( pd ) regime@xcite , indicating a phase diffusive dynamics due to multiple escape and retrapping events in the washboard potential ( sketched in fig .",
    "[ figure2]b ) , or equivalently described in terms of thermal activation above a dissipation barrier@xcite . below @xmath21 , scds obey the thermal activation ( ta ) regime . upon further lowering the temperature",
    "the junction can eventually enter the macroscopic quantum tunneling regime@xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ figure1]b , jct a ) .",
    "the md regime gives a very important reference for our discussion of sample c. in both cases the width of the scd decreases upon increasing the temperature , as shown in figs .",
    "[ figure1 ] and [ figure2 ] .",
    "only an exact fitting of the scds at different temperatures can reveal the very different physics occurring in the various junctions .",
    "jcts a and b of the present work have been chosen since they are fabricated on different substrates ( see ref . ) and both show the transition to the pd regime , in which the derivative @xmath23 is negative , but with a different detailed @xmath24 dependence@xcite .",
    "the choice of the substrate affects the effective capacitance of the circuit the junction is embedded into@xcite . as a consequence of this choice , for jct b we observed the transition from ta to the pd regime , while for jct a the ta regime is completely suppressed and we observed a direct transition from mqt to the pd regime@xcite .",
    "we show below that the `` anomalous '' thermal behavior of high @xmath0 jct c can not be explained in terms of frequency dependent damping or as a consequence of the shell circuit , and the numerical simulations of fig .",
    "[ figure2]c fully support this .    in jcts a and b the rate of decrease in @xmath17 above @xmath21 with increasing @xmath24",
    "is well described by the monte carlo fit of the phase dynamics@xcite ( blue and red solid lines in fig .",
    "[ figure2]a , respectively ) .",
    "the temperature dependence of the skewness @xmath25 gives additional distinctive criteria to confirm the intermediate dissipation regime@xcite .",
    "this is signaled by a transition for jct b for instance from @xmath25 @xmath26 -0.9 at low temperatures ( @xmath27 0.1 k ) in the ta to @xmath25 @xmath26 -0.1 above the transition temperature @xmath28 1.0 k in the pd , indicating a progressive symmetrization of the scds@xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the moderately damped regime gives the opportunity of comparing @xmath22 and @xmath29 dependencies of scd spectra at higher temperatures , which turn out as unambiguous distinctive criteria for the different switching modes .",
    "jct c is characterized by high values of @xmath0 close to those observed in nanowires@xcite .",
    "this device exhibits radically different phase dynamics above 3 k , which represents a transition temperature we indicate as @xmath30 .",
    "also in the case of jct c , @xmath30 is defined as the maximum of @xmath22 , but we prefer to use a different symbol to stress the distinct switching dynamics , as pointed out below .",
    "the rate of decrease of @xmath17 above @xmath30 turns to be a distinctive marker of the phase dynamics . in device",
    "c the slope of @xmath22 above @xmath30 is much smaller when compared to those of jcts a@xcite and b and of all moderately damped jjs .",
    "the smooth decrease of @xmath17 for @xmath31 can not be described in terms of the intermediate dissipation regime , as evident from the numerical simulations reported in fig .",
    "[ figure2]c . according to the rcsj model , keeping all the other junctions parameters fixed ,",
    "an increase of @xmath0 leads to an enhancement of @xmath7 and @xmath11 .",
    "the increase of @xmath11 moves @xmath21 to higher values , and the negative slope of @xmath22 above @xmath21 becomes steeper and steeper ( as shown by the numerical simulations for @xmath11 ranging between 1 and 10 reported in fig .",
    "[ figure2]c ) .     of the scds measured on jcts",
    "b ( red triangles ) and c ( black circles ) respectively . retrapping processes in the pd regime cause a progressive symmetrization of the scds of jct b , signaled by the thermal dependence of @xmath25 , which is almost 0 above the transition temperature @xmath21 .",
    "asymmetric scds , as the histogram measured at @xmath32 ( shown in the top left corner of the figure ) , become gaussian - like distributions above @xmath21 ( see the histogram measured at @xmath33 in the top right corner ) .",
    "the histograms of jct c are asymmetric over the whole temperature range , including for temperatures above @xmath30 ( as shown by the scd measured at @xmath34 k reported in the lower right corner of the figure ) .",
    "the black dashed line indicates the mean value of the skewness ( @xmath35 ) . ]    in addition , while moderately damped jjs show a progressive symmetrization of the switching histograms near to and above @xmath21 ( see jct b in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] ) , scds of jct c are asymmetric over the entire temperature range . in jct c ,",
    "the @xmath25 factor is temperature independent , consistent with what is observed in pure phase slip systems@xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] , the black dashed line indicates the mean value @xmath36 - 0.8 for jct c ) .",
    "these behaviors are quite distinct and do not fall in the framework of any regime of the rcsj model .",
    "we find that the numerical simulation of a transition driven by local heating events accounts well for devices in the @xmath0 interval ( 10@xmath4 a/@xmath37 - 10@xmath38 a/@xmath37 ) , as shown for jct c in fig .",
    "[ figure4]a .",
    "hysteresis in i - v curves@xcite does not necessarily indicate canonical josephson phase dynamics , even in the presence of a fraunhofer magnetic field pattern@xcite .",
    "it may rather arise as a result of local heating processes , possibly induced by intrinsic inhomogeneous composition unavoidable for high @xmath0 junctions .",
    "large values of joule power density deposited in the weak link can induce a self - heating process during the switch to the resistive branch@xcite .",
    "the absence of a set of self - consistent electrodynamics parameters to describe jct c is a strong indication of the failure of the standard josephson dynamics .",
    "this failure is of general relevance , applying both to conventional low @xmath39 jjs@xcite and to the emergent class of hybrid nanoscale junctions@xcite . for larger values of @xmath0 ,",
    "heating driven mechanisms become dominant with a transition to the normal state locally in the junction area .",
    "these events are the mirror of non - equilibrium processes and can be modeled as `` phase slips entities '' ( pses ) , as confirmed by the details of the simulations which are reported in refs .",
    ", in the sense that they are local processes , break the coherence of the phase information and are described by a heat diffusion - like equation . in particular , the probability for a single heating event can be still described in terms of the langer - ambegaokar - mccumber - halperin ( lamh ) theory@xcite and further extensions@xcite , and pses can still be approximately assumed to be far apart in time .",
    "the typical time scale of a pse is of the order of the ginzburg landau relaxation time @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 , with @xmath39 the superconducting critical temperature .",
    "the energy dissipated by a pse @xmath43 is rather high , as the modulus of the order parameter has to vanish over a length @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the zero temperature coherence length in the superconductor and @xmath46 is the flux quantum .",
    "following an approach proposed in ref . for low critical temperature superconducting ( lts ) wires ,",
    "our numerical simulation of the temperature jump induced by a pse obeys the phenomenological diffusive equation for the relaxation of the temperature gradient :    @xmath47    here @xmath48 is the deviation from the temperature of the bath @xmath49 .",

    "the temperature jump @xmath63 depends on temperature because the specific heat is strongly temperature dependent . at low temperatures",
    "the specific heat is quite low , thus with each pse there is a considerable increase in the temperature . in addition , the thermal conductivity and the thermal capacity are both quite low as the system is deeply into the superconducting phase . in a rough sense ,",
    "the system is rather isolated from the environment and the thermal shock due to a heating event is destructive for the superconducting state .",
    "for this reason a single heating event can induce a direct jump to the resistive state at low temperatures : it induces a large local heating that is difficult to dissipate .",
    "the system is not at equilibrium with its environment , and we can define an effective temperature @xmath61 for the system , which is higher than @xmath49 as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure4]c .    at high temperatures we are in the opposite regime of small @xmath64(t ) per heating event@xcite .",
    "in addition both the thermal conductivity @xmath51 and the thermal capacity @xmath52 increase with increasing temperature as well .",
    "thermal diffusion and contact with the environment is more effective and multiple pses are required for switching .",

    "[ figure4]c ) , which we interpret as the temperature at which the system is able to thermalize during the time interval between well separated heating events . in this temperature range ,",
    "the value chosen for the fitting parameter @xmath59 becomes important to quantify the number of successive pses , which are responsible for the transition . in fig .",
    "[ figure4]b the difference between a single and multiple heating events is shown . at 7 k for instance about 4 - 6 pses",
    "are needed to reproduce the experimental scd .",
    "experimental scds complemented by the numerical simulations follow the passage from single to multiple heating events .",
    "this is similar to what has been observed in lts nanowires@xcite .",
    "a consistent set of the junction parameters ( temperature jump @xmath64 , number of heating events ) can be extracted from these simulations , as discussed in ref . .",
    "the passage above a characteristic @xmath0 threshold to a state that does not sustain josephson phase - coherence should be universally expected in weak link systems .",
    "the threshold probably depends on the type of junction , responding to structurally different ways of enhancing barrier transparency and generating sources of local heating .",
    "the threshold of @xmath65 a/@xmath37 found for our junctions is consistent with the general empiric rule on hts gbs@xcite .",
    "in bicrystal junctions , an increase in the misorientation angle between the two electrodes determines a well - known decrease of the critical current density . for small misorientation angles devices",
    "are found in the flux - flow regime . for @xmath66 josephson phenomenology starts to appear for @xmath0 values of @xmath67 a/@xmath37 @xcite .",
    "several effects have also been observed in conventional trilayer nb / al - oxide / nb jjs above the same threshold of about @xmath68 a/@xmath37 that could be attributed to non - equilibrium dynamics@xcite .",
    "some analogies can be established with what is observed in @xmath4he superfluid@xcite . here",
    "the passage from weak to strong coupling manifests itself in a change in the current - phase relation [ @xmath69 . in the strong coupling regime , where the healing length of the superfluid is lower than the diameter of the constriction , deviations from the @xmath70 relation appear , while sinusoidal josephson oscillations have been measured in the opposite limit@xcite .",
    "an increase in @xmath0 and in the coupling between the electrodes leads to the presence of other harmonics in the @xmath71 , which might become multivalued@xcite .",
    "a heat diffusion - like model breaking phase - coherent information is consistent with our data on high @xmath0 jct c. here the switch to the normal state is accompanied by a local release of energy characteristic of a pse .",
    "when departing from the supercurrent branch , non - equilibrium processes produce an unexpected heating .",
    "this is surprisingly different from what commonly is accepted for hysteretic josephson junctions , where heating can only influence the retrapping phenomena , as a memory of the history of heating in the resistive state@xcite .    in the framework of the rcsj model the resistance arises from non - local properties well described by the ( frequency dependent ) quality factor @xmath11 of the circuit",
    "this reminds us of the landauer picture of quantum transport , in which quantum interference acts at the interface while the dissipation and memory loss occurs in the contacts . on the other hand , when the switch is driven by pses ,",
    "it is the local properties of the order parameter which are important : phase memory is lost when the modulus of the order parameter becomes zero .",
    "the model based on local heating events can be in principle further extended to extract the @xmath71 and to fully define the role of dissipation in high @xmath0 junctions .    to conclude ,",
    "standard phase dynamics of a hysteretic josephson junction collapses and can not be sustained above some threshold of the critical current density @xmath0 . in high @xmath0 devices information",
    "is lost in non - equilibrium dynamics , and can be partly codified in the local heating process .",
    "this is of great relevance for all the experiments using low - dimensional barriers , which should be concerned about possible heating effects , leading to distorted phase information .",
    "non - equilibrium effects would obviously invalidate a large number of key predictions for majorana fermions and nanoscale superconductivity in josephson junctions , since for instance they can give rise to zero bias anomalies in conductance measurements@xcite . the proof of quantifiable non - equilibrium processes already in the thermal regime poses severe constraints on the possible occurrence of macroscopic quantum phenomena at lower temperatures in high @xmath0 samples through standard scd measurements .",
