    "the other classes carry only partial or no entanglement , some exist just in the mixed - state scenario ( two - mode and three - mode biseparable states @xcite ) and one might be then tempted to doubt about their practical utility . however , the astonishing protocol for entanglement distribution by a separable system @xcite teaches us about the opposite .",
    "originally developed for qubits @xcite , later extended to gaussian states @xcite , and experimentally demonstrated in @xcite , it shows that also other , even mixed and just partially separable states may demonstrate new phenomena which are not encountered in the context of fully inseparable states .",

    "the protocol thus shows that direct transmission of entanglement is not necessary to entangle two separate parties but only communication of a separable quantum system , local operations and a priori shared suitable fully separable state of three quantum systems suffice to accomplish the task .    in this paper",

    "the protocol thus shares similarity with the quantum secret sharing protocol @xcite for entanglement @xcite in which a dealer splits one part of a bipartite entanglement among several players in such a way that some collections of players can recover the entanglement with the dealer whereas the other collections can not .",
    "if in the present case the modes @xmath0 and @xmath2 of the initial separable state are shared by two observers , called alice and bob , then entanglement created by splitting on alice s side of mode @xmath0 into two modes @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be turned into the entanglement between alice and bob only if bob has physically at his disposal also either of the split modes @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "remarkably , there is a certain interval of entanglement strengths for which bob can establish entanglement with alice by the coherent beam splitting operation on his mode and the received mode but he can not establish it by any gaussian measurement on his mode @xmath2 followed by displacement of modes @xmath0 and @xmath1 which challenges the question about the presence of bound entanglement in the considered state . like in the case of the entanglement distribution by a separable ancilla the protocol works only with mixed states and starts with a suitable fully separable three - mode gaussian state .",
    "in contrast with a two - mode biseparable state which is created in the second step of the entanglement distribution protocol a one - mode biseparable state is created in the intermediate step of the present entanglement sharing protocol .",

    "the performance of the proposed protocol is enabled by the remarkable separability properties of the state with cm ( [ gammaaaprb ] ) .",
    "let us investigate first the separability of the state with respect to the splitting of modes @xmath14 and @xmath2 into two groups ( @xmath45-mode separability ) .",

    "the state is , however , entangled with respect to the remaining @xmath15 and @xmath16 splittings as can be easily proven using the positive partial transposition criterion @xcite expressed in terms of symplectic invariants @xcite .",
    "specifically , separability of mode @xmath46 from a pair of modes @xmath47 in a generic gaussian state of three modes @xmath48 and @xmath49 with the cm @xmath50 can be determined from the symplectic invariants of the matrix @xmath51 associated with the partial transpose of the state with respect to mode @xmath46 . here , @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the pauli diagonal matrix .",

    "let us focus now on the separability of the two - mode reductions ( @xmath65-mode separability ) of the state with the cm ( [ gammaaaprb ] ) .",

    "the cm ( [ gammaaaprb ] ) any two modes are separable .",
    "note , that the aforementioned separability properties of the state with cm ( [ gammaaaprb ] ) can exist only in a mixed - state scenario .",
    "indeed , for a pure state separability of mode @xmath2 from modes @xmath69 implies the state to be a product state across the @xmath17 splitting .",
    "likewise , the separability of the mode @xmath0 from the mode @xmath1 implies that the reduced state of the modes @xmath0 and @xmath1 is also a product state .",
    "consequently , a pure three - mode state where the mode @xmath2 is separable from modes @xmath69 and mode @xmath0 is at the same time separable from mode @xmath1 is therefore a triple product state which is fully separable .",
    "such a state , however , can not possess entanglement across , e.g. , @xmath15 splitting as is the case of our state .    at the final stage of the protocol alice keeps mode @xmath0 and sends the separable mode @xmath1 to bob .",

    "we have already seen that for the state with the cm ( [ tildegammaaaprb ] ) [ ( [ tildetildegammaaaprb ] ) ] mode @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) is entangled with mode @xmath2 .",

    "but what about entanglement across the remaining @xmath16 @xmath86 $ ] splitting ? analyzing the entanglement using again the criterion ( [ sigmadef ] )",
    "one gets for the cms ( [ tildegammaaaprb ] ) and ( [ tildetildegammaaaprb ] ) the following expressions : @xmath87 where the quantity @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) characterizes separability of the mode @xmath1 ( @xmath0 ) in the state with the cm ( [ tildegammaaaprb ] ) [ ( [ tildetildegammaaaprb ] ) ] and @xmath90 is given in eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) .",
    "hence , for the considered squeezing @xmath62 the state in the last step of the present protocol is in both cases entangled across all three bipartite splittings and it therefore carries a genuine three - mode entanglement .",
    "the proposed sharing scheme thus also illustrates remarkable transformation properties of the three - mode fully separable state given by a product of a separable state of modes @xmath0 and @xmath2 with cm ( [ gammaab ] ) and a vacuum state of mode @xmath1 .",
    "namely , the beam splitting transformation ( [ uij ] ) on a two - mode subsystem formed by modes @xmath0 and @xmath1 transforms the state into the one - mode biseparable state which is separable with respect to @xmath17 splitting and entangled across @xmath15 and @xmath16 splittings . moreover",
    ", the second beam splitter on modes @xmath1 ( @xmath0 ) and @xmath2 preserves the latter entanglement and further creates entanglement also across @xmath17 splitting , i.e. , creates a genuine three - mode entanglement .",
    "it can seem for the first sight that bob may not need coherent beam splitting operation on his mode @xmath2 and the received mode @xmath1 ( @xmath0 ) to establish entanglement with alice s mode @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) .",

    "now we show , that if bob is restricted to gaussian measurements there is a region of squeezing parameters @xmath77 for which he is unable to establish any entanglement with alice by this measure - and - displace strategy .",
    "the task to be solved can be formulated as a task for finding maximum entanglement which can be localized between modes @xmath0 and @xmath1 of the state with cm ( [ gammaaaprb ] ) by optimal gaussian measurement on mode @xmath2 of the state .",
    "this problem , known as gaussian localizable entanglement , has already been solved in the literature @xcite .",
    "it can be conveniently analyzed using the concept of lower symplectic eigenvalue of the partially transposed state , which is for a generic cm @xmath91 of two modes @xmath0 and @xmath2 written in the @xmath26-block form with respect to @xmath92 splitting @xmath93 given by @xcite @xmath94 where @xmath95 .",
    "the state with cm @xmath91 contains entanglement if and only if @xmath96 .",
    "the symplectic eigenvalue @xmath97 also characterizes the amount of entanglement in the state which can be quantified by the logarithmic negativity @xmath98@xcite . as @xmath99 is a monotonically decreasing function of the symplectic eigenvalue it follows that the smaller the value of @xmath100 the larger the entanglement . for certain families of three - mode gaussian states one can find even analytically the symplectic eigenvalue ( [ mu ] ) for a two - mode state obtained by gaussian measurement on the third mode minimized over all gaussian measurements on the mode @xcite .",
    "the present state with cm ( [ gammaaaprb ] ) belongs to the class of the bisymmetric states for which the problem of the gaussian localizable entanglement can also be fully resolved using the analytical tools @xcite .",

    "we have constructed a two - mode separable gaussian state which can be transformed by splitting of one of its modes on a beam splitter to a state without any two - mode entanglement but with entanglement across two bipartite splittings .",
    "if the initial two - mode state is shared by distant alice and bob , the beam splitter on alice s side creates entanglement between one of its outputs and a non - local composite system composed of the other output of the beam splitter and the distant bob s mode .",

    "the entanglement can nevertheless be turned into entanglement between alice and bob by sending one output mode of alice s beam splitter ( which is separable from the other output mode ) to bob and mixing it with bob s mode on another beam splitter .",
    "the protocol just described thus can be interpreted as an entanglement sharing scheme in which entanglement created by alice s beam splitter can be transformed into entanglement with bob only if bob has at his disposal physically also one output mode of the beam splitter .",
    "besides , our analysis shows that for one copy of the key one - mode biseparable state of our protocol entanglement can not be distilled between any two modes with the help of the third party if bob is restricted to gaussian measurements which is a nontrivial property necessary for the presence of the bound entanglement in the state .",
    "the question of whether the same holds true also for more generic even non - gaussian operations on bob s mode and multiple copies is left for further research .",

    "<S> we propose an entanglement sharing protocol based on separable states . </S>",
    "<S> initially , two parties , alice and bob , share a two - mode separable gaussian state . </S>",
    "<S> alice then splits her mode into two separable modes and distributes them between two players . </S>",
    "<S> bob is separable from the players but he can create entanglement with either of the players if the other player moves to his location and collaborates with him . </S>",
    "<S> any two parties are separable and the creation of entanglement is thus mediated by transmission of a mode which is separable from individual modes on alice s and bob s side . for the state shared by the players and bob one can not establish entanglement between any two modes even with the help of operation on the third mode provided that bob is restricted to gaussian measurements and the state thus carries a nontrivial signature of bound entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> the present protocol also demonstrates switching between different separability classes of tripartite systems by coherent operations on its bipartite parts and complements studies on protocols utilizing mixed partially entangled multipartite states . </S>"
