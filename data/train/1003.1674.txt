    "the extragalactic tev sky catalogue ( @xmath1 gev ) , counts nowadays 35 objectsrwagner / sources/ ] .",
    "many of these sources have recently been detected also at gev energies by the _",
    "fermi _ satellite  ( abdo  et  al . 2009 ) , allowing for the first time a quasi - continuous coverage of the spectral shape of extragalactic vhe emitters over more than 4 decades of energy . except for two starburst galaxies and two radiogalaxies , all the others are blazars , radio - loud active galactic nuclei with a relativistic jet closely oriented toward the earth , as described in urry @xmath2 padovani  ( 1995 ) .",
    "the apparent luminosity of the non - thermal radiation emitted by the jet is then largely enhanced by relativistic beaming and dominates the observed high energy emission .",
    "typically , the spectral energy distribution ( seds ) emitted from these objects , extending from radio waves to gamma - ray frequencies , is composed of two broad humps . in the case of tev detected blazars",
    ", the first component usually peaks in the uv - x - ray band , and the second peak is located at gev - tev energies .",
    "the first component is identified as electron synchrotron radiation , whilst the second component is widely attributed to inverse compton scattering of ambient photons by the same synchrotron emitting electrons .",
    "relativistic electrons are accelerated within a region in bulk relativistic motion along the jet  ( e.g. tavecchio  et  al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "vhe photons emitted by cosmological sources are effectively absorbed , through the pair production process , @xmath3 , by the interaction with the so - called extragalactic background light ( ebl ) ( stecker , de jager @xmath2 salamon 1992 ) .",
    "ebl is composed of stellar light emitted and partially reprocessed by dust throughout the entire history of cosmic evolution .",
    "the expected ebl spectrum is composed by two bumps at near - infrared and far - infrared wavelengths  ( hauser  @xmath2  dwek  2001 ) .",
    "direct measurement of the ebl has proved to be a difficult task , primarily due to the zodiacal light that forms a bright foreground which is difficult to suppress . due to the lack of direct ebl knowledge , many models have been elaborated in the last years  ( stecker , malkan @xmath2 scully  2006 ; franceschini , rodighiero @xmath2 vaccari  2008 ; gilmore  et  al .  2009 ; kneiske @xmath2 dole  2010 ) . moreover , for some blazars the derivation of the intrinsic spectrum is also difficult due to the uncertainty or lack of a redshift measurement . in particular a direct spectroscopic measure of the redshift is often difficult in bl lac objects , which are characterized by extremely weak emission lines ( equivalent width @xmath4 5 @xmath5 ) .    [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     having derived this empirical relation we can try to use it to _ derive the redshift _ of sources with uncertain distance .",
    "this can be done under the assumption that the source of interest shares similar spectral properties with the sources used to derive the fit ( basically they have similar values of the spectral break measured by @xmath6 ) .    to demonstrate the feasibility of such a method , in the last column of table  [ table_values ] we report the values of the _ reconstructed _ redshift , @xmath7 $ ] , obtained by applying the inverse formula ( @xmath7=(z^*-a)/b$ ] ) to the @xmath8 estimated with the franceschini et al .",
    "ebl model .",
    "in order to avoid a bias , the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath9 are each time calculated excluding from the fit the source for which we estimate the redshift @xmath7 $ ] . the differences between the real and the reconstructed redshifts , @xmath10 is drawn in figure  [ dispersion_plot ] , filled area . despite the low statistic ,",
    "the distribution is quite well described by a gaussian centered in zero with a @xmath11 of @xmath12 .",
    "the separated shaded histogram represents the @xmath10 of the uncertain redshift sources .",
    "z plot ( z[true]-z[rec ] ) ( filled histogram ) and superimposed the two sources with uncertain redshift ( s5  0716 + 714 and 3c  66a ) , not used for the gaussian fit.,width=326 ]",
    "we presented a method that allows the estimation of the quantity @xmath8 , upper limit on the redshift of a tev emitting blazar with a gev counterpart observed by _",
    "fermi_/lat , obtained by deabsorbing the observed tev spectrum .",
    "in order to use the largest sample of spectra for this study , we made several assumptions : first of all we combined gev and tev data even if the observations in the different energy bands were not simultaneous .",
    "the impact of this choice , however , is probably moderated by fact that we do not use the flux but only the values of the slopes , less variable than the flux ( unless in extreme states ) .",
    "for example the spectral slope of the hbl 1es  1218 + 304 recently measured by the veritas collaboration ( acciari  et  al .",
    "2010b ) during a high flux level , matches within the errors the slope determined during its quiescient state .",
    "secondly , in this work we use tev spectra observed with various cherenkov experiments , characterized by different sensitivities .",
    "this difference , especially at high energies , could affect the result , leading to systematic effects in the distance limit determination .",
    "another possible cause of systematics could be the use of all the blazar sample , independently from the nature of the source : we did nt apply any distinction between hbl , lbl and fsrq , characterized by a different position of the ic peak .    despite all these approximations , the method presented in this paper applied to a sample of test sources gave satisfactory results .",
    "the @xmath8 values obtained by correcting the spectra from the ebl absorption , are , in fact , all above the real redshift values if we use a mean background photon level .",
    "this suggest the use of this method for constraining the distance of unknown redshift sources .",
    "we applied the @xmath8 estimate also to two sources with uncertain distance : in both cases the limit lies below the quoted values .",
    "this result could be due to some intrinsic properties of the sources ( specifically , a more moderate intrinsic spectral break between the gev and tev bands than that of the other sources ) , or to a wrong estimate of their distances . in the latter case , our method would constrain the redshift of s5  0716 + 714 below @xmath13 and that of 3c  66a below @xmath14 . it can be pointed out that in the case of s5  0716 + 714 , the redshift of 0.31 used in this work , recently reported by nilsson et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , is estimated by assuming the luminosity of its host galaxy .",
    "another estimate on the blazar distance , based on the spectrography of the three galaxies close to this source , gives the value of @xmath15 for its redshift , more in agreement with our derived limit .",
    "the same procedure was applied to our sample using two extreme ebl models .",
    "the low density one gives even safer upper limits on the sources distances , while the @xmath8 obtained with the high density model are closer to the real redshift values .",
    "even with this model , all the estimates are above or on the bisector , confirming our assumption that the deabsorbed tev slope can not be harder than the gev slope reported by _ fermi_/lat .    following previous works , we tested the possibility of a linear relation between our @xmath8 estimates and the real distances of the sources .",
    "we found that the linear fit describes quite well our results , independently on the ebl model considered , although the slope and intercept of the fits are different in the three cases ( table  [ params ] ) .",
    "the relation found suggests to use the @xmath8 estimate not only to set an upper limit on unknown distances of blazars , but also , via the inverse - formula , to try an evaluation of this distance . in order to investigate this opportunity , we tested it on our sample of sources using the mean ebl model , paying a special attention to avoid biases in the calculation .",
    "the distribution of the difference @xmath10 between the reconstructed and the real redshift is well described by a gaussian peaked in zero with a @xmath11 of @xmath12 . once again , the uncertain redshift sources are outside the expected interval .",
    "the value of the redshift of s5  0716 + 714 obtained with this method is @xmath16 , where the error quoted is the @xmath11 of the @xmath10 distribution . for 3c  66a",
    ", the same procedure leads to a redshift estimate of @xmath17 .",
    "as a final example of application , we use our procedure to pks  1424 + 240 , a blazar of unknown redshift recently observed in the vhe regime by veritas  ( acciari  et  al .",
    "the _ fermi_/lat spectrum slope measured between @xmath18 to @xmath19 gev is @xmath20 and the corresponding @xmath8 redshift at which the deabsorbed tev spectrum slope equals it is @xmath21 , using franceschini et al .",
    "ebl model .",
    "this result is in agreement with the value of @xmath22 , reported by acciari  et  al .",
    "( 2010a ) , calculated applying the same procedure but only simultaneous _ fermi _ data .",
    "our estimate on the most probable distance for pks  1424 + 240 , obtained by inverting the @xmath8 formula , is @xmath7=0.24\\pm0.05 $ ] , where the error , as before , is assumed as the @xmath11 of the gaussian fitting the @xmath10 of fig .",
