    "what are the boundary conditions for grand unification ?",
    "one typically assumes that the gauge couplings of the broken subgroups must become numerically equal at the unification scale @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "however , effects from physics above the unification scale can alter the gauge coupling unification condition . in an effective field theory approach",
    ", such effects can be caused by dimension-5 operators of the form @xmath0 , which shift the coefficients of the gauge kinetic terms in the low - energy theory after the higgs @xmath1 acquires a vacuum expectation value in grand unified symmetry breaking @xcite ; one obvious source of such operators is quantum gravitational effects .",
    "indeed , it would be _ unnatural _ ( or require some special explanation ) to assume that the wilson coefficients @xmath5 above be zero or especially small @xcite ; the default assumption should be that these coefficients are of order unity in grand unified models , with consequent unification conditions .    in conventional unification models",
    ", one might expect @xmath6 gev , plausibly leading to effects from quantum gravity of order a fraction of a percent , @xmath7 , on the gauge coupling unification condition .",
    "in @xcite we showed that these dimension-5 operators can be even more relevant than previously suspected since the planck mass @xmath8 tends to be smaller than naively assumed due to its renormalization group evolution @xcite under the influence of the large number of fields in supersymmetric grand unified theories .",
    "it was noted @xcite that these dimension-5 operators introduce in supersymmetric unification models an uncertainty that can be bigger than the two - loop effects which are considered to be necessary to obtain good numerical unification of the gauge couplings .",
    "the aim of this paper is different .",
    "we study whether the dimension-5 operators discussed above can lead to perfect gauge coupling unification _ without _ supersymmetry by their modifying of the gauge coupling unification condition .",
    "this unification scheme has been studied previously in the literature for models with and without supersymmetry , e.g.  in @xcite , but in less detail and generality and mostly only the effect from a single gravitational operator has been considered .    in particular , in this paper we examine , in a systematic way , the effects when two or more dimension-5 operators are present in a theory .",
    "unification under multiple dimension-5 operators has been studied before @xcite for the supersymmetric case @xcite , for which , however , viable gauge coupling unification is well known @xcite .",
    "the main result of the present paper is that the measurement of the gauge couplings at the @xmath9 mass @xcite is compatible with non - supersymmetric grand unification based on @xmath3 or bigger groups like @xmath4 .",
    "that is , grand unification does not require a supersymmetric extension of the standard model for a range of natural values of the wilson coefficients @xmath5 .",
    "as opposed to models with one dimension-5 operator , in unified models with two or more such operators , the unification scale @xmath2 can be varied in a continuous and controlled manner with the wilson coefficients @xmath5 and higgs vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) , and we examine this quantitatively in @xmath3 and @xmath4 theories , primarily for the non - supersymmetric case ( cf .",
    "@xcite for the supersymmetric case ) .",
    "we find that unification under this scheme can naturally raise the unification scale @xmath2 much above the conventional @xmath10 to @xmath11 , and even allows to obtain gauge coupling unification at or near the planck mass which is suggestive of unification of all gauge and gravitational forces at a common scale ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "any such unification is safe from the proton decay constraint .",
    "this , and the fact that exact gauge coupling unification in the first place can be accomplished , may be a useful tool for model building .",
    "note , due to the gravitational origin of these dimension-5 operators , the unification scheme considered here is distinct from the lavoura - wolfenstein result @xcite or similar effects @xcite , according to which non - supersymmetric unification can result from particle thresholds .",
    "in particular , as can be seen from the form of these effective operators , their effect increases as the unification scale gets closer to the planck scale , i.e. , as the higgs vevs get bigger , which in turn allows to self - consistently shift @xmath2 to values much larger than conventionally assumed .    realistic supersymmetric unification theories have issues linked to their large particle content .",
    "one is the presence of landau poles between the unification and the planck scale , another is possible lack of calculability in these theories due to potentially large running of the planck mass @xcite .",
    "both issues are avoided in their non - supersymmetric counterparts .",
    "on the other hand , if supersymmetry is abandoned , the unification scale needs to be stabilized with respect to the gravitational scale ( as , of course , does the weak scale ) .",
    "this `` little hierarchy problem '' can be avoided by one of the scenarios mentioned above where grand unification happens close to the planck mass , thereby reducing or eliminating the hierarchy between the two scales .    [",

    "we see that even the lowest unification scales @xmath2 , that are achievable in a natural way through our effect , are not in conflict with the current lower bounds on the proton lifetime , coming from the non - observation of proton decay so far .",
    "thus , the dimension-5 operators can facilitate exact gauge coupling unification without supersymmetry and also allow the proton decay limit to be evaded ( unlike in naive @xmath3 unification ) .",
    "we also investigate how further improvements in the proton lifetime bound constrain our models .    in section [ gaugegravitysection ] , we note that numerical gauge coupling unification is possible near or at the planck scale in a very natural way in models with two or more dimension-5 operators .",

    "we briefly look at the effect of the dimension-5 operators in models of supersymmetric unification @xcite , making contact to the literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) . we find that in supersymmetric models the unification scale can also be shifted around , although unification close to the expected @xmath12 seems most likely .",

    "in other words , at our energies the effective lagrangian of the world is a gauge theory with certain additional non - renormalizable operators of dimension 5 and higher , accounting for the gravitational interactions that have been integrated out .",

    "then , the unified coupling @xmath137 is determined by ( [ unificationconditionapp ] ) as well , and so is the overall scale @xmath98 of the vevs via ( [ assertmxwithratios ] ) . finally , with a choice ( [ suppressionscale ] ) of the planck scale @xmath8 , the required wilson coefficients @xmath132 can be computed from ( [ howtosolve ] ) .",
