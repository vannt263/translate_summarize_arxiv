    ", several schemes have been settled along the last years . for the production ,",
    "the most noticeable proposals rely on cooper pair emission from superconducting contacts , @xcite correlated electron - hole pair production in tunnel barriers , @xcite and integrated single - particle emitters .",
    "@xcite it is a widespread belief that these mechanisms are likely to produce highly entangled electron currents .",
    "unfortunately , serious difficulties arise for the detection and quantification of the entanglement produced by those means .",
    "ideal approaches are based on the violation of bell - like inequalities @xcite in terms of zero - frequency noise correlators , @xcite sometimes including postselection mechanisms . however , corresponding efforts have been unsuccessful so far , most probably due to technological limitations for the controlled manipulation of a relatively large amount of parameters ( only indirect signatures of entanglement as the two - particle aharonov - bohm effect @xcite have been found in the laboratories @xcite ) . in this situation , alternative approaches were developed with a more pragmatic viewpoint in the form of entanglement witnesses , namely , specific observables that can detect entangled states belonging to a certain subspace of interest by introducing a limited amount of controlled parameters .",
    "@xcite in particular , a series of works has addressed the possibility of bounding the entanglement of electronic currents via single observables by mapping the probe states into werner states @xcite ( a concept recently extended to isotropic states @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , giovannetti _ et al . _",
    "@xcite introduced a procedure allowing the discrimination of different types of entanglement , viz .",
    "the conventional mode entanglement ( focused on the internal degrees of freedom of given particles ) and the less appraised occupancy entanglement ( relying on fluctuating local particle numbers).@xcite         here , we propose an integer quantum - hall interferometer that integrates in a single circuit an electronic entangler with an entanglement - witness analyzer .",
    "the entangler is based on a previous scheme by frustaglia and cabello@xcite that employs the multi - rail encoding ( i.e. , spatially separated transmission channels or modes ) of electron - hole pairs produced at a tunnel barrier , originally designed for exploiting only spatial - mode qubit entanglement ( also referred to as path- or orbital - mode entanglement ) by postselection , i.e. , by filtering out any contribution to occupancy entanglement .",
    "the interferometer introduced in ref .  , sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig-1]a , is the electronic version of the optical interferometer proposed by cabello _ _ et al.__@xcite to solve a fundamental deficiency present in the original franson s bell - like proposal with energy - time entanglement @xcite due to the actual existence of a local hidden variable model reproducing the observed results.@xcite our detection strategy , instead , implements the results obtained in ref . for the discrimination of spatial - mode and occupancy entanglement .",
    "this relies on the inspection of current cross correlations at the output ports of an electronic beam splitter ( bs ) , provided that controllable , channel - dependent phase shifts are introduced in one of the input ports .",
    "notice the contrast with the approach originally adopted in ref .",
    "based on the violation of bell - clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequalities @xcite by noise cross correlations , @xcite which results inappropriate for the analysis of occupancy entanglement due to superselection rules ( ssrs ) induced by local particle - number conservation.@xcite",
    "let us start by reviewing the electronic interferometer introduced in ref .  ,",
    "schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig-1]a .",
    "a source emits an electron - hole pair , with the electron and hole travelling in opposite directions towards beam splitters bs-1 and bs-2 , respectively . after meeting the corresponding beam splitter , each member of the electron - hole pair splits independently into two paths @xmath0 ( electron ) and @xmath1 ( hole )",
    ". path @xmath2",
    "( @xmath3 ) takes the electron ( hole ) to the right ( r ) side of the interferometer for detection , while path @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) does likewise in the left ( l ) side .    after scattering at bs-1 and bs-2 ,",
    "the resulting electron - hole excitation consists of a multi - rail superposition containing different number of excitations in the l and r arms of the interferometer .",
    "more precisely , two contributions are found in which one excitation flies off to the right and the other one to the left , together with two contributions in which both particles fly off to the same side of the interferometer .",
    "@xcite when written in the _ left - right _ ( l - r ) _ bipartition basis _",
    ", this state displays hyper - entanglement , viz . ,",
    "standard spatial - mode entanglement and occupancy entanglement .",
    "the first one corresponds to the two - qubit entanglement between l and r propagating channels , with exactly one particle occupying one of the l and r channels , while the second one results form the coherent superposition of terms with different local particle number : two particles occupying both of the l propagating channels ( and no particles on the r channels ) or vice versa @xcite ( see also ref . ) .    ) before scattering at the corresponding beam splitter .",
    "these phases are controllable via voltage gates ( e.g. , top or side gates ) inserted along paths @xmath2 and @xmath3 . the entanglement witness is built from current cross correlations at output ports 3 ( terminals l1 and l2 ) and 4 ( terminals r1 and r2 ) .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig-3 ] for its quantum - hall implementation . ]    in ref .",
    ", postselected spatial - mode qubit entanglement is detected via the violation of a bell - chsh inequality , with bs - l and bs - r playing the role of controllable local operators acting on l and r propagating channels . to this end ,",
    "coincidence measurements used in the optical version of the interferometer @xcite are replaced by zero - frequency current - noise cross correlations between terminals placed at different sides of the electronic interferometer : one on the left ( terminals l1/l2 ) and the other one on the right ( terminals r1/r2 ) . by construction",
    ", this procedure postselects the components contributing to spatial - mode entanglement _ only _ , disregarding those contributions carrying more than one excitation to the l or r terminals .",
    "@xcite moreover , the use of bell - chsh inequalities to detect occupancy entanglement would require local mixing of quantum states with different number of fermions , which is forbidden by ssrs .",
    "for this reason , we reconfigure the interferometer depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig-1]a to implement the witness scheme introduced in ref .   in order to address _ both _ the spatial - mode and occupancy entaglement of two - particle probe states .",

    "it is most important to realize that the analyzer introduced in ref .",
    "consists in a _",

    "this is equivalent to introduce two spatially separated bss : one for electrons ( bs - e ) and one for holes ( bs - h ) , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] .",
    "this results in the design sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig-1]b .",
    "it is worth noting that the topology of this setup coincides with that of franson s interfereometer .",
    "@xcite however , the correlations considered by franson are essentially different from those needed here .",
    "franson s setup , as demanded by bell - chsh tests , would require the study of noise cross correlations between l1/r1 and l2/r2 terminals in fig .",
    "[ fig-1]b ( namely , between electron and hole excitations ) . here , instead , in order to discriminate mode from occupancy entanglement by following the protocol described in ref .",

    "the bs-0 is set to be low transmitting ( tunneling regime ) .",
    "thus , an electron traveling from primary source 1 can tunnel through bs-0 to the right side of the interferometer , leaving a hole in the fermi sea traveling towards the left side .",
    "after emission at bs-0 , each member of the electron - hole pair splits into a pair of paths at bs-1 and bs-2 , respectively , which results in a spatial - mode and occupancy entangled electron - hole excitation in the original l - r bipartition , as discussed above.@xcite the _ secondary _ source 2 is not directly involved in the production of entanglement itself .",
    "its role is to avoid contamination of the signal generated at bs-0 with the undesired current - noise correlations that would originate at bs-2 in the absence of this secondary source .",
