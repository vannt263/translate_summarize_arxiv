    "determining the distance modulus of a given sn involves several steps : 1 ) imaging it in multiple filters ; 2 ) transforming the photometry to observer rest frame apparent magnitudes ; 3 ) determining the apparent magnitude(s ) at maximum light ; 4 ) correcting the apparent magnitudes for dust extinction along the line of sight ; and 5 ) subtracting an estimate of the supernova s absolute magnitude at maximum for each filter . since the discovery of the brightness / decline rate relation by ( * ? ? ?",
