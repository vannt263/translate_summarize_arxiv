    "gradient and hessian recovery has been commonly used in mesh adaptation for the numerical solution of partial differential equations ( pdes ) ; e.g. ,  see  @xcite .",
    "the use typically involves the approximation of solution derivatives based on a computed solution defined on the current mesh ( recovery ) , the generation of a new mesh using the recovered derivatives , and the solution of the physical pde on the new mesh .",
    "these steps are often repeated several times until a suitable mesh and a numerical solution defined thereon are obtained .",
    "as the mesh is refined , a sequence of adaptive meshes , derivative approximations , and numerical solutions results .",
    "a theoretical and also practical question is whether this sequence of numerical solutions converges to the exact solution .",
    "naturally , this question is linked to the convergence of the recovered derivatives used to generate the meshes .",
    "it is known that recovered gradient through the least squares fitting  @xcite or polynomial preserving techniques  @xcite is convergent for uniform or quasi - uniform meshes  @xcite and superconvergent for mildly structured meshes  @xcite as well for a type of adaptive mesh  @xcite .    for the hessian",
    ", it has been observed that , unfortunately , a convergent recovery can not be obtained from linear finite element approximations for general nonuniform meshes  @xcite , although hessian recovery is known to converge when the numerical solution exhibits superconvergence or supercloseness for some special meshes  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , numerical experiments also show that the numerical solution obtained with an adaptive mesh generated using a nonconvergent recovered hessian is often not only convergent but also has an error comparable to that obtained with the exact analytical hessian . to demonstrate this",
    ", we consider a dirichlet boundary value problem ( bvp ) for the poisson equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are chosen such that the exact solution of the bvp is given by @xmath3 two hessian recovery methods , qls ( quadratic least squares fitting ) and wf ( weak formulation ) are used ( see  [ sect : recovery : methods ] for the description of these and other hessian recovery techniques )",
    ". shows the error in recovered hessian and the linear finite element solution with exact and recovered hessian .",
    "one can see that the finite element error is convergent and almost undistinguishable for the exact and approximate hessian ( [ fig : x2y2:25:solution ] ) whereas the error of the hessian recovery remains @xmath4 ( [ fig : x2y2:25:recovery ] ) .",
    "obviously , this indicates that a convergent recovered hessian is not necessary for the purpose of mesh adaptation .",
    "of course , a badly recovered hessian does not serve the purpose either .",
    "0.5 [ fig : x2y2:25:intro],title=\"fig : \" ]    0.5 [ fig : x2y2:25:intro],title=\"fig : \" ]    how accurate should a recovered hessian be for the purpose of mesh adaptation ?",

    "notice that [ eq : agliva99:2 ] does not require @xmath5 to converge to @xmath6 as the mesh is refined .",
    "instead , it requires the eigenvalues of @xmath15 to be around one ( cf .",
    "[ sect : analysis:1 ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , it is still too restrictive to be satisfied by most examples we tested ; see  [ sect : examples ] .",
    "thus , the work  @xcite does not give a full explanation why a nonconvergent recovered hessian works in mesh adaptation .",
    "the objective of the paper is to present a study on this issue . to be specific",
    ", we consider a bvp and its linear finite element solution with adaptive anisotropic meshes generated from a recovered hessian .",
    "we adopt the @xmath16-uniform mesh approach  @xcite to view any adaptive mesh as a uniform one in some metric depending on the computed solution .",
    "an advantage of the approach is that the relation between the recovered hessian and an adaptive anisotropic mesh generated using it can be fully characterized through the so - called alignment and equidistribution conditions ( see [ eq : equi , eq : ali ] in  [ sect : analysis:1 ] ) .",
    "this characterization plays a crucial role in the development of a bound for the @xmath17 semi - norm of the finite element error .",
    "the bound converges at a first order rate in terms of the average element diameter , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the number of elements and @xmath20 is the dimension of the physical domain .",
    "moreover , the bound is valid under a condition on the closeness of the recovered hessian to the exact one ; see [ eq : crs ] or [ eq : crplus : general , eq : crminus : general ] . this closeness condition is much weaker than [ eq : agliva99:2 ]",
    ". roughly speaking , [ eq : agliva99:2 ] requires the eigenvalues of @xmath15 to be around one whereas the new condition only requires them to be bounded below from zero and from above .",
    "numerical results in  [ sect : examples ] show that the new closeness condition is satisfied in all examples for four commonly used hessian recovery techniques considered in this paper whereas [ eq : agliva99:2 ] is satisfied only in some examples .",
    "furthermore , the error bound is linearly proportional to the ratio of the maximum ( over the physical domain ) of the largest eigenvalues of @xmath15 to the minimum of the smallest eigenvalues .",
    "since the ratio is a measure of the closeness of the recovered hessian to the exact one , the dependence indicates that the finite element error changes gradually with the closeness of the recovered hessian .",
    "hence , the error for the linear finite element approximation of the bvp is convergent for the considered hessian recovery techniques and insensitive to the closeness of the recovered hessian to the exact one .",
    "this provides an explanation how a nonconvergent recovered hessian works for mesh adaptation .",
    "an outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "convergence analysis of the linear finite element approximation is given in  [ sect : analysis:1,sect : general ] for the cases with positive definite and general hessian , respectively .",
    "a brief description of four common hessian recovery techniques is given in  [ sect : recovery : methods ] followed by numerical examples in  [ sect : examples ] .",
    "finally , [ sect : conclusion ] contains conclusions and further comments .",
    "we consider the bvp @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a polygonal or polyhedral domain of @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) , @xmath25 is an elliptic second - order differential operator , and @xmath1 and @xmath2 are given functions .",
    "we are concerned with the adaptive mesh solution of this bvp using the conventional linear finite element method .",
    "denote a family of simplicial meshes for @xmath22 by @xmath26 and the corresponding reference element by @xmath27 which is chosen to be unitary in volume .",
    "for each mesh @xmath28 , we denote the corresponding finite element solution by @xmath29 .",
    "ca s lemma implies that the finite element error is bounded by the interpolation error , i.e. , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a constant independent of @xmath32 and @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the nodal interpolation operator associated with the linear finite element space defined on @xmath33 .",
    "note that [ eq : cea-1 ] is valid for any mesh .",
    "in this paper we consider adaptive meshes generated based on a recovered hessian @xmath5 and use the @xmath16-uniform mesh approach with which any adaptive mesh is viewed as a uniform one in some metric @xmath16 ( defined in terms of @xmath5 in our current situation ) .",
    "it is known  @xcite that such an @xmath16-uniform mesh satisfies the equidistribution and alignment conditions , @xmath35 where @xmath19 is the number of mesh elements , @xmath36 is an average of @xmath16 over @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the affine mapping from the reference element @xmath27 to a mesh element @xmath37 , @xmath39 is the jacobian matrix of @xmath40 ( which is constant on @xmath37 ) , and @xmath41 and @xmath42 denote the determinant and trace of a matrix , respectively .    in practice , it is more realistic to generate less restrictive quasi-@xmath16-uniform meshes which satisfy @xmath43 where @xmath44 are some constants independent of @xmath37 , @xmath19 , and @xmath28 .",
    "numerical experiments in  @xcite and  [ sect : examples ] ( [ fig : flower : ceq , fig : flower : cali , fig : tanh : ceq , fig : tanh : cali ] ) show that quasi-@xmath16-uniform meshes with relatively small @xmath45 and @xmath46 can be generated in practice .",
    "for this reason , we use quasi-@xmath16-uniform meshes in our analysis and numerical experiments .",
    "we would like to point out that conditions [ eq : equi : approx , eq : ali : approx ] with @xmath47 imply [ eq : equi , eq : ali ] .",
    "indeed , the inequality [ eq : ali : approx ] with @xmath48 becomes the equality [ eq : ali ] because the left - hand side of it ( the arithmetic mean of the eigenvalues of @xmath49 ) can not be smaller than the right - hand side ( the geometric mean of the eigenvalues ) .",
    "further , if @xmath50 then [ eq : equi : approx ] becomes @xmath51 this implies @xmath52 and therefore @xmath53 which can only be valid if all values of @xmath54 are the same for all @xmath37 .",
    "in this section we consider a special case where the hessian of the solution is uniformly positive definite in @xmath22 ; i.e. , @xmath55 where the greater - than - or - equal sign means that the difference between the left - hand side and right - hand side terms is positive semidefinite .",
    "we also assume that the recovered hessian @xmath5 is uniformly positive definite in @xmath22 .",
    "this assumption is not essential and will be dropped for the general situation discussed in  [ sect : general ] .",

    "further , @xmath77 similarly , @xmath78 thus , [ eq : hr11:1 ] yields @xmath79 using this , [ eq : ali : approx ] , [ eq : ali : inverse ] , [ eq : crs ] , the fact that the trace of any @xmath80 symmetric and positive definite matrix @xmath81 is equivalent to its @xmath82 norm , viz . , @xmath83 , and absorbing powers of @xmath20 into the generic constant @xmath31 , we get @xmath84 applying [ eq : equi : approx ] to the above result and using [ cr+ ] gives @xmath85 further , assumption  [ eq : crs ] implies @xmath86 and @xmath87 thus , @xmath88 which , together with [ eq : cea-1 ] , gives [ eq : thm : h1 ] .      shows how a nonconvergent recovered hessian works in mesh adaptation .",
    "the error bound [ eq : thm : h1 ] is linearly proportional to the ratio @xmath89 , which is a measure for the closeness of @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",
    "thus , the finite element error changes gradually with the closeness of the recovered hessian . if @xmath5 is a good approximation to @xmath6 ( but not necessarily convergent ) , then @xmath90 and the solution - dependent factor in the error bound is @xmath91 on the other hand , if @xmath5 is not a good approximation to @xmath6 , solution - dependent factor in the error bound will be larger .",
    "for example , consider @xmath92 ( the identity matrix ) , which leads to the uniform mesh refinement . in this case",
    "the condition [ eq : crs ] is satisfied with @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 denote the maximum and minimum eigenvalues of @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "thus , for @xmath96 the solution - dependent factor in the bound [ eq : thm : h1 ] becomes @xmath97 which is obviously larger than [ eq : factor:1 ] .",
    "next , we study the relation between [ eq : crs ] and [ eq : agliva99:1][eq : agliva99:2 ] . in practical computation ,",
    "the hessian is typically recovered at mesh nodes ( see  [ sect : recovery : methods ] ) and a recovered hessian can be considered on the whole domain as a piecewise linear matrix - valued function . in this case , the average @xmath57 of @xmath5 over any given element @xmath37 can be expressed as a linear combination of the nodal values of @xmath5 .",
    "applying the triangle inequality to [ eq : agliva99:1,eq : agliva99:2 ] we get @xmath98 and , since @xmath57 is a linear combination of @xmath99 , @xmath100    since @xmath101 is symmetric , @xmath102 .",
    "thus , conditions [ eq : agliva99:1,eq : agliva99:2 ] imply @xmath103 and @xmath104 which in turn implies [ eq : crs ] with @xmath105 and @xmath106 , if @xmath107 .",
    "condition [ eq : r : h : i ] and therefore [ eq : agliva99:2 ] require the eigenvalues of @xmath108 to stay closely around one .",
    "on the other hand , condition [ eq : crs ] only requires the eigenvalues of @xmath108 to be bounded from above and below from zero , which is weaker than [ eq : agliva99:2 ] .",
    "if @xmath5 converges to @xmath64 , both [ eq : agliva99:2,eq : crs ] can be satisfied .",
    "however , if @xmath5 does not converge to @xmath64 , as is the case for most adaptive computation , the situation is different . as we shall see in  [ sect : examples ] , condition [ eq : crs ] is satisfied for all of the examples tested whereas condition [ eq : agliva99:2 ] is not satisfied by either of the examples .",
    "we would like to point out that it is unclear if the considered monitor function [ eq : m : h1 ] ( and the corresponding bound [ eq : thm : h1 ] ) is optimal , although it seems to be the best we can get . for example , if we choose the monitor function to be @xmath109 which is optimal for the @xmath110 norm  @xcite , the error bound becomes @xmath111 this bound has a larger solution - dependent factor than [ eq : thm : h1 ] since hlder s inequality yields @xmath112 it is worth mentioning that when the metric tensor [ eq : m : l ] is used , the @xmath110 norm of the piecewise linear interpolation error is bounded by @xmath113 which is optimal in terms of convergence order and solution - dependent factor , e.g. ,  see  @xcite .    note that [ thm : h1 ] holds for @xmath73 although the estimate [ eq : thm : h1 ] only requires @xmath114 since @xmath115 [ reg-1 ] can be satisfied when @xmath116 .",
    "thus , there is a gap between the sufficient requirement @xmath117 and the necessary requirement @xmath116 .",

    "thus , we can not use @xmath5 directly to define the metric tensor which is required to be positive definite .",
    "a commonly used strategy is to replace @xmath5 by @xmath132 since @xmath133 retains the eigensystem of @xmath5 .",

    "[ eq : crplus : general , eq : crminus : general ] can be satisfied with @xmath140 for any @xmath5 . at the same time , the metric tensor defined in [ eq : m : h1:2 ] has an asymptotic behavior @xmath141 and the corresponding @xmath16-uniform mesh is a uniform mesh . obviously , the right - hand side of [ eq : thm : h1:general ] is large for this case .",

    "a quadratic polynomial ( denoted by @xmath153 ) is found by least squares fitting to the values of @xmath29 at the selected nodes .",
    "the linear system associated with the least squares problem usually has full rank and a unique solution .",

    "mixed derivatives are averaged in order to obtain a symmetric recovered hessian .",
    "this method is similar to dlf except that the first - order derivatives at nodes are calculated in a different way . in this method ,",
    "the first - order derivatives are first calculated at element centers and then at nodes by linear least squares fitting to their values at element centers .",
