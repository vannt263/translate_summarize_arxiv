    "much of the complexity of strong interaction dynamics derives from the non - commutativity of the gauge fields , encoded in their matrix character .",
    "it leads to the gluonic self - interactions , which generate phenomena such as asymptotic freedom , and presumably also confinement due to the constriction of chromoelectric fields into flux tubes .",
    "matrix - valued degrees of freedom are notoriously difficult to handle , even in cases where one has managed to eliminate the space - time dependence of the matrices .",
    "one such example may be the large-@xmath0 limit of qcd ( @xmath0 denoting the number of colors ) @xcite @xcite .",
    "there one argues that gauge field path integrals should be dominated by a large-@xmath0 saddle point , and that there is a gauge where this saddle point , commonly referred to as the `` master field '' , is constant in space and time .",
    "this is plausible in view of the translational invariance in space - time of the underlying action and measure .    in the case of large-@xmath0 qcd ,",
    "it is not even known how to formulate a potential purely in terms of space - time independent matrices which will reproduce the master field ; however , also if one posits some potential of one s choice , such simplified matrix models generically become intractable as soon as more than one matrix degree of freedom is involved , i.e. as soon as non - commutativity is allowed to play a role .",
    "there are notable exceptions , such as the itzykson - zuber integral @xcite , which lies at the heart of the kazakov - migdal and penner models @xcite @xcite . in these models , due to the special type of potential involved",
    ", some selected observables can be calculated .",
    "recently , there has been some advance in the mathematical literature concerning a type of non - commuting variables called free random variables @xcite ; it has furthermore been shown ( loc.cit . )",
    "that in the large - n limit , independent hermitian matrix models describe variables of this type .",
    "these are models governed by a partition function of the form @xmath1 \\exp \\left ( -n \\sum_{i=1}^{d } \\mbox{tr } \\ , v(a_i ) \\right)\\ ] ] where the integration is to be carried out over the real and imaginary parts of the matrix elements of the @xmath2 , subject to the constraints of hermiticity .",
    "the potential , consisting of a sum of terms each only involving one of the matrices , thus only determines the eigenvalue distributions of the @xmath2 but there is no bias with respect to the relative `` orientations '' of the matrix degrees of freedom ; each orientation is equally probable .",
    "this restriction is quite strong ; most interesting matrix models , presumably including the one describing the master field of qcd , contain interactions between the different matrices .",
    "it should be noted , though , that the constructions used in the theory of free random variables may be extended to more general models and have recently led to some increased understanding of the functional analytic spaces on which the master field may be formally defined @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "however , even noninteracting matrix models constitute interesting laboratories for the study of phenomena associated with non - commutativity .",
    "initially , it is well known how to derive the eigenvalue distributions of the involved matrices from their respective potentials .",
    "the eigenvalue distribution is related by a hilbert transform to the derivative of the potential ; i.e. if the hermitian matrix @xmath3 is governed by a potential term tr@xmath4 , then the eigenvalue distribution ( normalized to unity ) is determined by @xmath5 then , however , as soon as one attempts to calculate eigenvalue distributions of objects composite in the different matrices contained in the model , one is faced with their non - commutative nature . here , the methods developed in @xcite exhibit their full power ; they enable one to convolute the distributions of different free random variables in a quite general and systematic manner , not restricted to a very special form of the objects considered .    in this paper , two not altogether trivial cases of problems which can be solved",
    "completely analytically with the techniques developed in @xcite are exhibited .",
    "these are the problems of nonrelativistic particles with an internal color degree of freedom , with or without spin , moving in a free gaussian random gauge background .",
    "the objective of this work is to develop some intuition regarding the phenomenological consequences of freeness in the context of large - n matrix degrees of freedom .",
    "this can be viewed as complementary to the recent more formal investigations mentioned above concerned with the formal definition of master fields and the spaces on which they operate . here",
    ", by contrast , the emphasis lies with the study of some exactly solvable model systems which may serve as paradigms for more complicated realistic cases .",
    "the examples treated here , while sufficiently simple to be of pedagogical value , nevertheless seem generic enough to be relevant for applications .",
    "some physics questions for which they may be of relevance will be mentioned at the end of the paper .",
    "it is to be expected that developing some insight into the phenomena resulting from freeness also is of some value from the point of view of the quest to understand interacting matrix models beyond the few existing solvable cases . with the advent of techniques allowing one to deal with free variables ,",
    "one controls the two limiting cases of vanishing and infinitely strong coupling between matrix degrees of freedom : a system of matrices whose orientations are completely aligned due to some strong coupling is as simple as a one - matrix model , since all matrices can be simultaneously diagonalised ; on the other hand , a system of matrices whose relative orientations are subject to no bias at all can now be treated as well . knowing both limits should provide valuable qualitative predictions for the behaviour of models even with nontrivial couplings .",
    "consider the hamiltonian @xmath6 this is the hamiltonian of a spinless nonrelativistic particle with color in @xmath7 dimensions , minimally coupled to a background vector field @xmath8 .",
    "each of the components of @xmath8 is taken to be an @xmath9 hermitian matrix ( where @xmath10 ) , constant in space and time .",
    "due to this last condition , the hamiltonian is diagonal in momentum space and the solutions can be classified according to the momentum components @xmath11 . for given @xmath12 and @xmath8 , there are @xmath13 different modes of propagation , i.e. color eigenvectors , for the particle .",
    "now , consider the vector field not as fixed , but to be averaged over an ensemble described by an independent matrix model . in other words ,",
    "any observable @xmath14 should be averaged as @xmath15 o(\\vec{a } ) \\exp \\left ( -n \\sum_{i=1}^{d } \\mbox{tr } \\ ,",
    "v(a_i ) \\right)\\ ] ] note that now the model is invariant under arbitrary unitary rotations of the variables @xmath2 .    in short ,",
    "the problem proposed is the following : given the eigenvalue distributions of the @xmath2 ( which can be easily found from the potential @xmath16 , as mentioned in the introduction ) , find the eigenvalue distribution of @xmath17 for arbitrary @xmath11 .",
    "since the model contains no bias with respect to the relative orientations of the @xmath2 , the @xmath2 constitute a family of free random variables , and the problem is a fairly straightforward application of the techniques developed in @xcite .",
    "this will serve as a warmup for the more involved case of the spinning particle , where one will have to deal with more exotic situations , such as the free random variables themselves appearing as components of matrices .    to treat a concrete model ,",
    "the potential @xmath18 must be specified . if one wishes to preserve invariance of the model under spatial rotations without destroying the freeness , one",
    "is forced to choose a gaussian potential , @xmath19 .",
    "the eigenvalue distribution for the matrices @xmath2 induced by this potential is the well - known semicircular distribution @xcite will be taken out of eigenvalue distributions , i.e. @xmath20 is normalized to unity .",
    "] , @xmath21 where @xmath22 .    as a first step in finding the eigenvalue distribution of the hamiltonian ,",
    "one easily finds the eigenvalue distribution of each of the summands @xmath23 of @xmath17 : if one has @xmath24 eigenvalues of @xmath2 in the interval @xmath25 $ ] , then the number of eigenvalues of @xmath26 to be found in the interval @xmath27 $ ] is @xmath28 . substituting @xmath29 ,",
    "one thus finds @xmath30 eigenvalues of @xmath23 in the interval @xmath31 $ ] , where @xmath32 of course now there are only positive eigenvalues , @xmath33 .",
    "it remains to convolute the eigenvalue distributions of the different summands @xmath23 .",
    "these are hermitian random variables , with eigenvalue distributions given by ( [ indd ] ) , and freely rotating with respect to one another , i.e. there is no bias in the relative orientations in color space of the variables when taking the ensemble average over the @xmath2 . to convolute these eigenvalue distributions , one must compute their so - called r - transform @xcite .",
    "the r - transform plays the same role for adding noncommuting free random variables as the logarithm of the fourier transform does for adding ordinary commuting random variables : convolution becomes ordinary addition , i.e. adding the r - transforms of the eigenvalue distributions of the summands gives the r - transform of the eigenvalue distribution of the sum .",
    "the r - transform is defined by the following algorithm : first , find the generating function of the moments of the distribution : @xmath34 which can be analytically continued to the entire upper complex half - plane by summing the geometric series : @xmath35 this continuation is important for the inverse problem of going from the generating function back to the distribution @xcite , @xmath36 next , find the function inverse to @xmath37 , i.e. @xmath38 such that @xmath39 .",
    "then , the r - transform is given by @xmath40 .",
    "it turns out that this program can still be carried out analytically for the program at hand ; one is led to algebraic equations of at most fourth order and thus just remains within the realm of solvability .",
    "the generating function corresponding to the distribution ( [ indd ] ) is easily calculated to be @xmath41 now , to find the inverse @xmath42 of @xmath43 , one must solve ( [ invgi ] ) for @xmath44 in terms of @xmath43 . by always bringing the terms containing no square roots to the left hand side and squaring the resulting equation ( this procedure must be applied twice ) ,",
    "one arrives at an equation with no square roots ; in this equation , quadratic in @xmath44 , the constant term vanishes , the trivial solution @xmath45 is spurious , and thus one arrives at @xmath46 the r - transform of the eigenvalue distribution of the hamiltonian is now simply the sum of the individual r - transforms corresponding to each spatial component : @xmath47 where @xmath48 , the squared euclidean length of the vector @xmath12 , has been introduced .",
    "note that the @xmath11 dependence of the individual r - transforms @xmath49 could have already been predicted from the additivity of the r - transform and the rotational invariance of the hamiltonian .",
    "from @xmath50 it already follows that @xmath51 must be of the form @xmath52 , as is manifest in ( [ indr ] ) .",
    "it remains to go from the r - transform @xmath53 back to the eigenvalue distribution of the hamiltonian .",
    "this is the more arduous task .",
    "inverting @xmath54 corresponds to solving the equation @xmath55 for @xmath56 in terms of @xmath44 .",
    "this is a fourth order equation for @xmath56 , which via the substitution @xmath57 can be brought to the normal form @xmath58 where the abbreviations @xmath59 have been introduced .",
    "the analysis of such an equation is quite involved , and for this reason is relegated to the appendix .",
    "the final result for the eigenvalue distribution of the hamiltonian ( [ hs0 ] ) , which according to ( [ stie ] ) is essentially the imaginary part of the solution of ( [ red4 ] ) , can be stated as follows : @xmath60 where @xmath61 the solution @xmath62 is plotted ( this representation avoids the trivial square root singularity at zero eigenvalue , especially further below in the case of the spinning particle ) for various values of the free parameters @xmath63 and @xmath7 in figures ( [ f1])-([f3 ] ) .",
    "note that when comparing different @xmath7 , there are two distinct sensible ways of choosing the units . on the one hand , one may take the width @xmath64 of the distributions of the vector fields as the unit of the square root of energy , as one does when comparing different @xmath65 ( cf . figures ( [ f1 ] ) and ( [ f2 ] ) ) .",
    "however , one may also rescale @xmath66 and use @xmath67 as the unit of the square root of energy .",
    "this corresponds to keeping the norm of the vector field , i.e. @xmath68 , constant as one varies @xmath7 ( just as one automatically does in the case of the momentum @xmath12 by only talking about its modulus ) , cf .",
    "figure ( [ f3 ] ) .    to characterize the behaviour of the solution more precisely , it is useful to evaluate various moments and limits .",
    "the first few moments of the distribution @xmath69 can be obtained without knowledge of the full solution ( [ fuls ] ) .",
    "it is sufficient to expand the r - transform ( [ rtra ] ) in a power series in @xmath56 and invert the corresponding series @xmath54 to the desired order , yielding the first few terms of @xmath70 expanded in powers of @xmath71 .",
    "the moments are then by definition the coefficients appearing in @xmath70 , yielding @xmath72 with the help of this information , one can obtain the behaviour of the distribution as @xmath73 or @xmath74 .    consider large @xmath7 , and use @xmath75 as the unit of energy .",
    "the distribution is centered around @xmath76 , with a width behaving as @xmath77 .",
    "substituting therefore @xmath78 in ( [ fuls ] ) , and keeping only leading pieces in @xmath79 , one obtains that @xmath80 always , and @xmath81 for @xmath82 $ ] . also , @xmath83 i.e. @xmath84 for @xmath85 $ ] .",
    "the condition on @xmath86 is more stringent than the one on @xmath87 and thus defines the support of the distribution .",
    "furthermore , one has @xmath88 in other words , for @xmath74 with fixed @xmath65 and @xmath64 one obtains a semicircular distribution centered at @xmath76 and with radius @xmath89 .    on the other hand ,",
    "if one chooses to use @xmath90 as the unit of energy , the limiting behaviour as @xmath74 can already be read off from the first two moments .",
    "the width of the distribution vanishes and one obtains a @xmath91-peak at @xmath92 .",
    "finally , taking the limit @xmath73 can be done in complete analogy to the limit @xmath74 above .",
    "however , it is not necessary to explicitely go through this : for @xmath73 , one can approximate the hamiltonian by @xmath93 .",
    "this means that one simply has to additively convolute the original semicircle distributions of the @xmath2 , with the radii scaled by a factor @xmath94 , respectively .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the semicircle distributions are closed under additive free convolution and that the radii add like components of an euclidean vector .",
    "therefore one immediately obtains the result that , for @xmath73 , the eigenvalue distribution of @xmath17 approaches a semicircle centered at @xmath48 and with radius @xmath95 .",
    "the physical interpretation of this result is clear : for @xmath96 , the quantum mechanical propagation of the particle is dominated by the semiclassical straight trajectories in the direction of @xmath12 .",
    "the particle does not see the transverse directions and behaves just as it would in a one - dimensional world ; correspondingly , the dimension @xmath7 does not enter the limiting semicircular eigenvalue distribution as @xmath73 .    on the other hand , when @xmath65 is finite , the particle does explore the dimensions available to it to some extent . for large @xmath7",
    ", the width behaves as @xmath97 ( and thus does not tend to a finite value when one scales the vector field to have constant norm as @xmath7 is varied ) .",
    "the semicircular nature of the distribution in the limit of large @xmath7 is understandable as a manifestation of the central limit theorem : for a large number of variables ( matrices ) , the sum of the random matrices ( after separating off the first moments ) behaves as if it was distributed according to a gaussian weight , i.e. as a semicircle @xcite .",
    "most interesting is the soft region around @xmath98 . for @xmath98 , the solution ( [ fuls ] ) simplifies considerably . in this case , one has @xmath99 and therefore only a nonvanishing eigenvalue distribution when @xmath100 . in this case",
    ", one has @xmath101 and therefore @xmath102 the edges of the distribution are determined by @xmath103 leading to @xmath104 , i.e. the support of the distribution is the interval @xmath105 $ ] .",
    "thus , in two or more dimensions , the eigenvalue distribution has a gap , even for @xmath106 , as already evidenced in figures ( [ f1])-([f3 ] ) .",
    "of course , for @xmath107 one just has for @xmath17 the distribution ( [ indd ] ) , which behaves proportionally to @xmath108 as @xmath109 . note also that the above result on the support of the distribution implies that , at @xmath98 , the spectrum of the square root of @xmath17 always has a support of length @xmath64 , for any dimension .",
    "formally , the emergence of an energy gap does not seem particularly surprising in view of the fact that the hamiltonian ( [ hs0 ] ) is a sum of squares .",
    "consider the more familiar case of ordinary ( commuting ) random variables , taking positive values , and with a finite probability density when one approaches zero .",
    "typically , the distribution of a sum of two such variables will vanish linearly at zero , because sampling the two variables , it is improbable to simultaneously find two very small values .",
    "there is actually a matrix realisation of this , namely two random matrices with the aforementioned type of distributions for the eigenvalues , but not freely rotating over the whole @xmath110 group with respect to one another ; instead , constrained to commute , i.e. only all permutations of the eigenvalues are allowed .",
    "presumably to realise this , one would have to introduce a strong interaction term between the two matrices , proportional to the square of their commutator .",
    "in the present case , by contrast , one is allowing a much larger class of relative orientations between the matrices , namely an arbitrary @xmath110 rotation .",
    "this larger invariance class evidently enhances the effect of making the occurrence of a small eigenvalue improbable in the sum of the matrices . for free random variables ,",
    "the effect is so strong that the resulting distribution not only vanishes as one approaches zero , but vanishes on a whole interval between zero and a finite value .",
    "the hamiltonian of a particle with spin in the same gauge background as was considered in the case of the spinless particle is the @xmath111 matrix @xmath112 where the @xmath113 denote the pauli matrices ; the number of space dimensions has now been specialized to @xmath114 . in the last term on the right hand side , one recognizes the coupling of the spin to the nonabelian magnetic field ; the latter contains no derivative term since the vector potential is taken to be spatially constant .    in practice , it is not helpful here to separate the hamiltonian into the spinless part and the spin - magnetic - field coupling .",
    "the crucial question when applying the free random variable techniques is whether one can cast the calculation into successive multiplications and additions of mutually free variables .",
    "e.g. , given two free random variables @xmath115 and @xmath116 , it is in general not straightforward to calculate the eigenvalue distribution of @xmath117 ; one may accomplish the multiplicative convolution in the second summand ( how this is done is explained below ) , but the two summands do not rotate independently of one another and therefore the free convolution techniques do not apply . on the other hand , the eigenvalue distribution e.g. of @xmath118 is straightforward to obtain once one writes @xmath119 .",
    "thus , in the case of the hamiltonian ( [ pham ] ) , having solved the spinless problem is of no assistance ; one must restart and consider the eigenvalue distribution of the object @xmath120 ( obtaining the distribution of @xmath121 at the end is trivial ) .    as in the case of the spinless particle , the eigenvalue distributions of the @xmath2",
    "are taken to be semicircular with radius @xmath64 ; the harmonic potential generating these distributions is invariant under spatial rotations . therefore , without loss of generality , one may take @xmath12 in the 3-direction , @xmath122 .",
    "being able to do this will be crucial for the developments to follow .",
    "one is faced here with a new situation : free random variables appearing as components of a matrix .",
    "considering for the moment matrices of finite rank , the eigenvalues @xmath123 of @xmath124 for a specific realisation of the gauge matrices @xmath2 are determined by the equation @xmath125 with the @xmath9 matrix @xmath126 note that @xmath127 has only half the rank of @xmath128 ; however , since @xmath127 is nonlinear in @xmath123 , it can have the same number of singular points in @xmath123 as @xmath128 , as required .",
    "the second equality in ( [ evdet ] ) is only valid as long as @xmath129 has no exact zero eigenvalues .",
    "however , this happens only on a set of @xmath123 of zero measure ; it suffices here to consider the generic case where the above equality is valid . also , the same consideration for @xmath130 shows that the ensemble averaged eigenvalue distribution of @xmath124 is symmetric about zero if the eigenvalue distributions of the @xmath2 are .",
    "therefore , it will be enough to consider positive @xmath123 .",
    "when one is faced with matrix equations nonlinear in a parameter such as @xmath123 in the present case , it is customary to go to an equation in larger matrices linear in the parameter @xcite .",
    "this is also familiar in the context of `` supersymmetry tricks '' . here",
    ", it is not helpful ; it just leads from @xmath127 back to the original matrix @xmath124 . instead , here",
    "the extended problem @xmath131 will be considered , and at the end specialized to @xmath132 . in the large-@xmath13 , ensemble averaged language , the eigenvalue distribution of @xmath127 , parametrically depending on @xmath123 , will be obtained using free convolution techniques .",
    "this yields a distribution @xmath133 which describes how many solutions of ( [ ext ] ) one finds at a point in the @xmath134 plane if one counts them as they occur on an increment @xmath135 in @xmath136-direction . in the end",
    ", this will have to be translated into how many solutions one finds if one counts them as they occur on an increment @xmath137 in @xmath123-direction ; then , one may set @xmath132 .",
    "one further issue must be settled before the free convolution techniques can be applied : in general , the two summands @xmath138 and @xmath139 appearing in @xmath140 , @xmath141 do not rotate independently of one another , since they both contain @xmath142 .",
    "this would thwart attempts to use free convolution .",
    "the special case considered here , however , can be rescued : the matrix @xmath143 , with @xmath144 and @xmath145 hermitian , represents a general complex matrix , which can be reparametrized using the polar decomposition @xcite @xmath146 where @xmath147 and @xmath148 are unitary and @xmath149 is diagonal and positive . integrating over all hermitian @xmath144 and @xmath145 corresponds to integrating over @xmath147 and @xmath148 with haar measure and over the eigenvalues @xmath150 contained in @xmath149 , @xmath151[da_2 ] = j(\\vec{\\eta } ) d^n \\eta \\ , [ du][dv]\\ ] ] where the jacobian is @xmath152 to be precise , the integration over @xmath148 is only over the quotient group @xmath153 ; this is no consequence , as will be explained below .",
    "also , note that in ( [ specd ] ) , the product @xmath154 is usually written as a single matrix ; however , since @xmath147 is being integrated over with haar measure , one can always pull out a factor @xmath148 .    in the new variables ,",
    "the potential governing @xmath144 and @xmath145 becomes @xmath155 and one has @xmath156 cast in this form , it becomes clear that the calculation of the @xmath127 eigenvalue distribution can be carried out using free convolution : the combination @xmath157 rotates independently of @xmath158 , and therefore the evaluation of the eigenvalue distribution of @xmath127 indeed becomes a sequence of free convolutions if one additionally uses that the eigenvalue distribution of @xmath139 is the same as the one of @xmath159 ( up to regions of zero measure in @xmath149 ) .",
    "it is also clear that the restricted integration domain of @xmath148 is of no consequence : for two variables to be free with respect to one another , it suffices to rotate one of the variables .",
    "the problem is in fact invariant under the additional rotations by @xmath148 and the @xmath148-integration gives only a normalization factor .",
    "finally , before applying multiplicative free convolution to obtain the eigenvalue distribution of @xmath160 , it remains to solve the saddle point equation for the eigenvalue distribution of @xmath161 , which is controlled by the jacobian ( [ poldj ] ) and the potential ( [ dpot ] ) .",
    "this standard procedure is carried out in the appendix , yielding @xmath162 note that @xmath149 itself is therefore distributed according to a quarter - circle of radius @xmath163 .    as explained in connection with the spinless particle , additive free convolution of eigenvalue distributions",
    "is accomplished by going to the corresponding r - transforms , which are additive ; similarly , for multiplicative free convolution one defines the s - transform @xcite , which behaves multiplicatively .",
    "the s - transform is defined as follows : find again the moment generating function @xmath164 as in ( [ ancong ] ) ; solve for the function inverse to @xmath165 , i.e. @xmath166 such that @xmath167 then the s - transform is given by @xmath168 with the help of these techniques , one can now carry out the necessary convolutions leading to the eigenvalue distribution of @xmath127 . starting with the eigenvalue distributions ( [ b2dist ] ) and ( cf . ( [ semic]),([indd ] ) )",
    "@xmath169 one obtains the corresponding generating functions @xmath170 in both cases , @xmath171 is determined by a quadratic equation after one has applied a procedure analogous to the one leading to eq .",
    "( [ indr ] ) . in the case of @xmath172 , the correct solution",
    "is easily picked out because there is a spurious zero solution ; in the case of @xmath173 , the correct solution can be picked out by considering the limiting behaviour as @xmath174 and using that the s - transform of the unit matrix multiplied by a constant @xmath175 is @xmath176 .",
    "thus one arrives at the s - transforms @xmath177 from this , one obtains that the function @xmath178 satisfies the equation @xmath179 and consequently , @xmath180 satisfies @xmath181 there is no need to solve for @xmath182 at this point ; the eigenvalue distribution of @xmath139 must still be additively convoluted with the one of @xmath138 .",
    "therefore , one can solve ( [ gq2eq ] ) directly for @xmath183 , @xmath184 where the relevant solution has been picked out by using , in the limit @xmath174 , that @xmath185 and therefore the r - transform @xmath186 . combining this with",
    "the r - transform corresponding to @xmath138 ( cf . ( [ q1def ] ) )",
    ", @xmath187 one finally obtains @xmath188 this determines @xmath189 and thus ultimately @xmath190 .",
    "however , before embarking on the arduous task of inverting ( [ gqlm1 ] ) , it is advantageous at this stage to consider how @xmath191 in the end determines the eigenvalue distribution @xmath192 of @xmath124 ( cf .",
    "( [ psqrh ] ) ) . considering for the moment finite matrices , the solutions of equation ( [ ext ] ) for a specific realization of the gauge matrices @xmath2 define continuous trajectories in the @xmath193 plane , cf .",
    "figure ( [ traj ] ) .",
    "asymptotically , there are trajectories in the vicinity of the lines defined by @xmath194 and @xmath195 , where `` vicinity '' means at a finite distance of roughly up to the semicircle radius @xmath64 .",
    "the quantity one is ultimately interested in is the number of trajectories one crosses if one marches from @xmath196 in along the @xmath123-axis to some point @xmath197 ; this is essentially the integral over @xmath198 . consider the conjecture that this is the same as the number of trajectories one crosses marching from @xmath199 in @xmath123-direction to @xmath200 , and then in @xmath136-direction to @xmath201 , cf .",
    "figure ( [ traj ] ) .",
    "there is one point which must be clarified before this statement can be accepted as true : in general , it might happen that a trajectory intersects the integration paths described above more than once , and then the two paths may count a different number of trajectory crossings , as displayed in figure ( [ traj ] ) in the right - hand graph .",
    "it will now be argued that this is not possible . to begin with ,",
    "note that @xmath202 this means that solving the extended problem ( [ ext ] ) with general @xmath136 is in fact equivalent to solving the original problem ( [ evdet ] ) with shifted @xmath65 and @xmath123 ( conversely , @xmath65 could be absorbed into @xmath123 and @xmath136 ) .",
    "now , the solutions @xmath123 of the original problem det@xmath203 are continuous in @xmath65 , which can be seen as follows : since the determinant of a hermitian matrix is real , the characteristic polynomial det@xmath204 is real - valued for real @xmath123 ; its coefficients are real polynomials in @xmath65 .",

    "however , at the point in @xmath65 where this discontinuity takes place , one would thus have more than @xmath205 zeros , which is impossible .",

    "there is an easier way to handle paths in the @xmath136-direction once one has treated the case of the @xmath123-direction : since one crosses each trajectory at most once when integrating in @xmath123-direction , it is necessary to cross all of them to saturate the normalisation condition in @xmath123-direction .",
    "then , however , one must also cross all of them if one marches in straight lines between the points @xmath209 . in other words , in this way one counts at least @xmath205 trajectories , and more if there are multiple intersections when marching in @xmath136-direction .",
    "however , one can easily check at the end using the large-@xmath13 , ensemble averaged result that the integral is exactly 2 ( remember that the factor @xmath13 has been scaled out everywhere in the eigenvalue distributions ) and therefore realisations of the @xmath2 which generate multiple intersections when marching in @xmath136-direction give vanishing contributions to the large-@xmath13 eigenvalue distributions .    in essence , the basic property which makes these arguments work is that the trajectories in the @xmath193 plane can be interpreted in two different ways . obviously , when considering the extended problem ( [ ext ] ) , one is considering the behaviour of the eigenvalues @xmath136 under changes of the parameter @xmath123 . on the other hand , due to the equivalence ( [ mleqv ] )",
    ", one can also interpret the trajectories as describing the behaviour of the eigenvalues @xmath123 under changes of the parameter @xmath136 ( up to the trivial additional linear shift in @xmath123 ) .",
    "these two interpretations taken together ensure the monotonicity of the trajectories , i.e. that they can cross each line of constant @xmath123 or @xmath136 only once .",
    "as a result of these observations one can now indeed relate @xmath191 to @xmath192 : @xmath210 which by differentiation with respect to @xmath197 gives @xmath211 .",
    "the second contribution on the right hand side arises as follows : for @xmath212 , there is a nonvanishing density of trajectories as @xmath213 due to the poles in @xmath127 ( cf . figure ( [ traj ] ) ) .",
    "these trajectories asymptotically become parallel to the @xmath136-axis , and therefore @xmath191 vanishes ( as it must due to normalisation ) as @xmath213 , since @xmath214 measures the number of trajectories encountered when marching in @xmath136-direction . on the other hand , marching in @xmath123-direction , one crosses these trajectories perpendicularly . for a concrete realization of the @xmath2 , they are determined as follows : in the complete problem det@xmath215",
    ", one can neglect @xmath138 for @xmath213 , i.e. one is looking for the infinite eigenvalues of @xmath139 ; these occur exactly when @xmath129 has zero eigenvalue , i.e. when @xmath216 is an eigenvalue of @xmath217 .",
    "therefore @xmath218 is just the ( shifted ) original semicircle distribution , @xmath219 one can therefore now specify @xmath198 : @xmath220 + \\rho_{a } ( k-\\lambda ) \\label{rpla}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( in this derivation it has been used several times that im@xmath221 never diverges , which will be verified below ) .",

    "for @xmath225 in ( [ gqlm1 ] ) , the left hand side vanishes and the square root can be eliminated by squaring the equation . eliminating the cubic term in the resulting quartic equation by the substitution @xmath226 one arrives at @xmath227 with @xmath228 given in terms of the dimensionless @xmath229 and @xmath230 .",

    "on the other hand , in the soft region around @xmath98 , the two cases differ qualitatively : there is no gap in the spectrum at @xmath98 for the particle with spin , since the discriminant ( [ disol ] ) is positive for @xmath235 , giving a nonzero result for ( [ posp ] ) . only at a certain nonzero value of @xmath65",
    "does the distribution detach from the origin .    in order to characterize this spin - induced effect more precisely , it is useful to evaluate the first two moments of the energy distribution . since in the present case ,",
    "the full generating function @xmath236 corresponding to the distribution @xmath237 is not explicitly available , one can not directly read off the moments .",
    "however , they are easily calculated using the axioms of freeness @xcite , which the random matrices @xmath2 obey .",
    "first , one trivially has that the first moments of the eigenvalue distributions of @xmath17 and @xmath238 are the same , @xmath239 since the additional spin - magnetic field coupling in @xmath238 obeys tr@xmath240 already in every fixed realization of the vector potential @xmath8 .",
    "then , one has @xmath241 ( again having used the tracelessness of the @xmath242-matrices ) .",
    "now , @xmath243 here , in the first equality it has been used that the matrices @xmath2 obey identical distributions ; in the second equality , the axioms of freeness for @xmath144 and @xmath145 have been utilized along with @xmath244 and @xmath245 .",
    "therefore , @xmath246 thus , the effect of the additional interaction of the spin with the magnetic field is merely to broaden , but not to shift , the eigenvalue distribution of the hamiltonian .",
    "it does this sufficiently strongly to make the energy gap arising in the case of a spinless particle disappear at small momenta @xmath65 .",
    "figure ( [ fc1 ] ) compares in order to compare two distributions normalised to unity . ]",
    "@xmath247 and @xmath248 for different @xmath65 .    evidently , it is possible for the particle to align its spin with the nonabelian magnetic field in ways which allow it to lower the energy associated with some of the modes of propagation to values near zero .",
    "there are sufficiently many such possibilities to make the gap in the energy distribution disappear for small momenta @xmath65 .",
    "a calculation of more specific spin - color magnetic field correlation functions , which would give a more detailed description of this effect , will be foregone here .",
    "in this work , the spectrum of a nonrelativistic particle with internal colour degree of freedom moving in a constant gaussian free random gauge background was discussed .",
    "both the case of a spinless particle and the case of a spin-1/2 particle were considered .",
    "the limit of large momenta @xmath65 is easily understood perturbatively ; the energy distribution becomes semicircular . also , in the spinless case for a large number of spatial dimensions , one obtains a semicircle as a consequence of the central limit theorem . on the other hand",
    ", the nonperturbative regime near @xmath98 displays very interesting features .",
    "the spectrum of the spinless particle exhibits a finite gap in two or more dimensions . evidently , for free random variables , the suppression of small eigenvalues in sums of squares ( such as the spinless hamiltonian ) is stronger than in the case of ordinary commuting random variables , for which only a linear vanishing of the distribution at zero occurs . by contrast , when the particle possesses a spin degree of freedom , the gap in the energy distribution disappears at small momenta .",
    "formally , this is understandable since the hamiltonian ceases to be a sum of squares ; physically , the particle can align its spin with the background color magnetic field such as to lower the energies of some of the modes .",
    "this effect is sufficiently strong to obliterate the gap in the energy spectrum occurring in the spinless case .    on a technical level ,",
    "the treatment depended crucially on the fact that the hamiltonians considered were block - diagonal in momentum space .",
    "thus , it would be very hard e.g. to combine a gauge background such as the one used here with a spatial harmonic oscillator potential for the particle . on the other hand",
    ", one can easily envision introducing such a gauge background into a bag model .",
    "in such a framework , the gauge background would provide a mechanism for generating masses for the constituent quarks",
    ". it would be interesting to pinpoint the differences between a bag model with a random gauge background and a conventional bag model with constituent quark masses introduced by hand .",
    "a related issue is the question of chiral symmetry breaking in a free random gauge background .",
    "the chiral condensate can be related via the casher - banks formula @xcite to the spectrum of the dirac operator @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "the methods developed here for the @xmath249 spin structure occurring in the pauli hamiltonian would seem to constitute a first step towards also evaluating the eigenvalue distribution of the @xmath250 dirac operator in a random gauge background .    finally , a different physical way to view the average over an ensemble of spatially constant gauge configurations is to identify the ensemble averaging with a domain or time averaging .",
    "if the gauge background through which the particle is propagating consists of domains of approximately constant color magnetic fields with random orientations , then the wave packet will feel different realisations of the gauge matrices as it evolves .",
    "averaging over such a background can be replaced by averaging over one domain with all possible background gauge configurations if one argues the effects of the domain walls to be small .",

    "note thus that ( [ sigc ] ) is fulfilled to leading order in @xmath71 with the conventional choice of the square roots .",

    "first , note that the constant term in the cubic resolvent equation ( [ cubr ] ) is negative . by vieta s theorem it thus follows that the product of its three solutions is always positive .",

    "further to this , one can show that , for @xmath274 , changes of sign of square roots according to condition ( [ sigc ] ) can only occur in regions of type 3 . ) in parameter space .",
    "the argument goes as follows : the right hand side of ( [ sigc ] ) being zero implies @xmath275 ( note that @xmath276 for @xmath274 ) . in these circumstances , the cubic resolvent eq .",

    "one is therefore indeed in a region of type 3 . ) in parameter space ; it is one of the two negative solutions which touches zero and whose square root therefore acquires a minus sign .",
    "below , slightly more than this will be needed , namely that when the solutions go from a region of type 2 . ) to a region of type 3 . ) and back to a region of type 2 . ) , either none or both the solutions which go from being complex conjugate to negative and back to complex conjugate must have acquired a minus sign for their square root .",
