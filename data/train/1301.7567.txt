    "moreover , under mild regularity conditions the process has transition densities @xmath7 relative to lebesgue measure . in this case",
    ", we can employ a bayes procedure for making inference about the drift function @xmath2 .",
    "this involves putting a prior distribution @xmath8 on the set of drift functions @xmath3 and computing the posterior @xmath9 .",
    "if the initial distribution is the invariant probability measure with density @xmath10 , the posterior measure of a measurable set @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 ( we assume of course the necessary measurability to ensure that this is well defined . )    this immediately reveals a practical complication , since the transition densities of a diffusion process can typically not be computed explicitly .",
    "several approaches have been proposed in the literature to circumvent this problem .",
    "these include for instance simulation - based methods for approximating the transition densities , or y. at - sahalia s closed - form expansions , cf .",
    "for example , jensen and poulsen @xcite for an overview .",
    "a method that has been proven to be particularly useful for dealing with bayes procedures is to view the continuous segments of the diffusion process between the observations as missing data and to employ a gibbs sampling scheme .",
    "practically this involves repeatedly simulating diffusion bridges to generate the missing data and drawing from the posterior distribution of @xmath2 given the augmented , continuous data @xmath13)$ ] .",
    "several schemes have been devised to simulate the diffusion bridges , see , for example , elerian _",

    "drawing from the continuous - data posterior can be done by more conventional methods , because contrary to the discrete - observations likelihood , the continuous - data likelihood has a known closed form expression given by girsanov s theorem .    for parametric models , where the drift function is known up to a euclidean parameter @xmath14 that has to be estimated , the outlined approach has been shown to provide an effective method for dealing with discretely observed diffusions .",
    "the approach is however not essentially limited to a parametric setup .",
    "the methodology has great potential to be developed into a practically feasible methodology in nonparametric settings as well .",
    "it is however very well known that in bayesian nonparametrics the choice of the prior distribution is crucial and posterior consistency is not automatically guaranteed ( e.g. , diaconis and freedman @xcite ) .",
    "this motivates the study of posterior consistency for discretely observed diffusions carried out in this paper .    in the i.i.d .- setting , sufficient conditions for posterior consistency were first obtained by schwartz @xcite .",

    "we consider discrete observations from a diffusion model ( [ eqsde ] ) , which constitute a markov chain .",
    "a number of recent papers have investigated the problem of posterior consistency or convergence rates for markov data , cf .",
    "for example , ghosal and van  der vaart @xcite , ghosal and tang @xcite , tang and ghosal @xcite .",
    "the results in these papers do however not immediately lead to practically useful results for our setting .",
    "the problem lies again in the fact that in our case , the transition densities of the model are typically not analytically tractable . since the conditions for consistency given",
    "for instance by tang and ghosal @xcite involve the transition densities , they can not be readily used to verify consistency for a given prior in our discretely observed diffusion model .",
    "the aim in this paper is to formulate conditions involving only the coefficients appearing in the stochastic differential equation ( [ eqsde ] ) .",
    "we achieve this by adapting the results of tang and ghosal @xcite to the present setting . basically , we need two assumptions .",
    "firstly , if @xmath15 denotes the true invariant probability measure of the process @xmath4 , we require that the prior puts positive mass on balls @xmath16 for each @xmath17 ( @xmath18 denotes a weighted @xmath19-norm and @xmath20 denotes the true drift ) .",
    "this is a natural condition , since if the prior excludes the true drift , consistency can never be obtained .",
    "secondly , we need an equicontinuity assumption ( definition  [ dflocunifequicont ] ) , which limits the size , or rather the complexity , of the set of drift functions . under these assumptions ,",
    "we obtain posterior consistency ( theorem [ theoremcon ] ) : the posterior measure of appropriately defined weak neighborhoods of the true drift function @xmath20 converges to @xmath21 almost surely , as the number of observations @xmath22 tends to infinity .",
    "this is the main result of the paper .",
    "ghosal and van  der vaart @xcite give conditions from which the posterior rate of convergence for markov chain data can be calculated .",
    "these conditions are a combination of a prior mass condition and a testing condition .",
    "this testing condition requires that one can test the true drift function against balls of alternatives with exponentially decaying error probabilities .",
    "such tests are not easily constructed in the present setup .",
    "appropriate tests for markov chains have been shown to exist under certain ( lower ) bounds on the transition probabilities ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in our setup",
    "such bounds do however not seem to be valid in general .",
    "an interesting line of future research would be to extend or adapt the available testing results for markov chains to the setting of discretely observed diffusions .",
    "this may not only give posterior consistency results in a stronger topology , but may pave the way for obtaining posterior rates of convergence as well . in the present paper ,",
    "we completely avoid the construction of tests .",
    "instead we employ martingale arguments in a similar fashion as tang and ghosal @xcite , who adapted the approach of walker  @xcite to the markov chain setting .",
