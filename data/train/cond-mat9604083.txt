    "bare perturbation theory strongly depends on this microscopic cutoff . to extract the universal content in the limit of long chains , it is necessary to eliminate this dependence by transformation to a renormalized theory . to this end",
    "several equivalent approaches exist . rather than performing direct renormalization @xcite of the polymer variables , we chose here to make use of language and formalism of local field theory , which is more apt to our intentions .",
    "for regularization and renormalization we use a dimensional scheme in the notation of @xcite . the mapping to field theoretic formalism is performed by a laplace transform in the gauian surfaces @xmath82 to conjugate chemical potentials , ` mass variables ' @xmath95 , @xmath96 to construct a local field theory , we transform from the functional integral over all configurations @xmath74 to an integral over a local field .",
