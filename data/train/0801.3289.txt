    "as a promising technique to increase spectral efficiency of overcrowded parts of the radio spectrum , the opportunistic spectrum access problem has been the focus of significant research activities  @xcite .",
    "the underlying idea is to allow unlicensed users ( i.e. , cognitive users ) to access the available spectrum when the licensed users ( i.e. , primary users ) are not active .",
    "the presence of high priority primary users and the requirement that the cognitive users should not interfere with them introduce new challenges for protocol design .",
    "the overarching goal of the current work is to develop a unified framework for the design of efficient , and low complexity , cognitive medium access protocols .",
    "the spectral opportunities available to cognitive users are by their nature time - varying . to avoid interfering with the primary network , cognitive users must first probe to determine whether there are primary activities before transmission . under the assumption that each cognitive user can not access all of the available channels simultaneously , the main task of the medium access protocol is to distributively choose which channels each cognitive user should attempt to use in different time slots , in order to fully ( or maximally ) utilize the spectral opportunities .",
    "this decision process can be enhanced by taking into account any available statistical information about the primary traffic .",
    "for example , with a single cognitive user capable of accessing ( sensing ) only one channel at a time , the problem becomes trivial if the probability that each channel is free is known _ a priori_. in this case ,",
    "the optimal rule is for the cognitive user to access the channel with the highest probability of being free in all time slots .",
    "however , such time - varying traffic information is typically not available to the cognitive users _ a priori_. the need to learn this information on - line creates a fundamental tradeoff between exploitation and exploration .",
    "exploitation refers to the short - term gain resulting from accessing the channel with the estimated highest probability of being free ( based on the results of previous sensing decisions ) whereas exploration is the process by which a cognitive user learns the statistical behavior of the primary traffic ( by choosing possibly different channels to probe across time slots ) . in the presence of multiple cognitive users ,",
    "the medium access algorithm must also account for the competition between different users over the same channel .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a unified framework for the design and analysis of cognitive medium access protocols in the presence of a single cognitive user who can access a single channel in each time slot .",
    "as argued in the sequel , this framework allows for the construction of strategies that strike an optimal balance between exploration and exploitation .",
    "we derive an optimal sensing rule that maximizes the expected throughput obtained by the cognitive user . compared with a genie - aided scheme ,",
    "in which the cognitive user knows _ a priori _ the primary network traffic information , there is a throughput loss suffered by any medium access strategy .",
    "we obtain a lower bound on this loss and further construct a linear complexity single index protocol that achieves this lower bound asymptotically ( when the primary traffic behavior changes slowly ) .",
    "similar approaches have been considered in  @xcite and  @xcite , but with different emphases .",
    "we have also extended our study to networks with multiple cognitive users and networks with more capable cognitive users , and have developed optimal strategies for these scenarios .",
    "however , due to space limitations , we do not discuss these results here .",
    "we also omit the proofs of results presented in this paper .",
    "interested readers can refer to  @xcite for details .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "our network model is detailed in section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "section  [ sec : full ] develops and analyzes an optimal strategy for the single cognitive user scenario .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : con ] summarizes our conclusions .",
    "figure  [ fig : model ] shows the channel model of interest . we consider a primary network consisting of @xmath0 non - overlapping channels , @xmath1 , each with bandwidth @xmath2 .",
    "the users in the primary network are operated in a synchronous time - slotted fashion .",
    "we assume that at each time slot , channel @xmath3 is free with probability @xmath4 . let @xmath5 be a random variable that equals @xmath6 if channel @xmath3 is free at time slot @xmath7 and equals @xmath8 otherwise .",
    "hence , given @xmath4 , @xmath5 is a bernoulli random variable with distribution @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a delta function .",
    "furthermore , for a given @xmath11 , the @xmath5 are independent for each @xmath3 and @xmath7 .",
    "we consider a block varying model in which the value of @xmath12 is fixed for a block of @xmath13 time slots and then randomly changes at the beginning of the next block according to a joint probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath14 .    in our model , the cognitive users attempt to exploit the availability of free channels in the primary network by sensing the activity at the beginning of each time slot .",
    "our work seeks to characterize efficient strategies for choosing which channels to sense ( access ) .",
    "the challenge here stems from the fact that the cognitive users are assumed to be unaware of @xmath12 _ a priori_. we consider two cases in which a cognitive user either has or does not have prior information about the pdf of @xmath12 , i.e. , @xmath14 . in the scenario presented in this paper , at time slot @xmath7 ,",
    "a single cognitive user selects one channel @xmath15 to access . if the sensing result shows that channel @xmath16 is free , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath17 , the cognitive user can send @xmath2 bits over this channel ; otherwise , the cognitive user will wait until the next time slot and pick a possibly different channel to access .",
    "therefore , the total number of bits that the cognitive user is able to send over one block ( of @xmath13 time slots ) is @xmath18 it is clear that @xmath19 is a random variable that depends on the traffic in the primary network and , more importantly for us , the medium access protocols employed by the cognitive user .",
    "therefore , the overarching goal of this paper is to construct low complexity medium access protocols that maximize @xmath20 .",
    "intuitively , the cognitive user would like to select the channel with the highest probability of being free in order to obtain more transmission opportunities .",
    "if @xmath12 is known then this problem is trivial : the cognitive user should choose the channel @xmath21 to sense .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath12 imposes a fundamental tradeoff between exploration , in order to learn @xmath12 , and exploitation , by accessing the channel with the highest estimated free probability based on current available information , as detailed in the following section .",
    "we start by developing the optimal solution under the idealized assumption that @xmath14 is known _ a priori _ by the cognitive user . as we will see",
    ", this optimal medium access algorithm suffers from a prohibitive computational complexity that grows exponentially with the block length @xmath13 .",
    "this motivates the design of low complexity asymptotically optimal approaches , which we also consider .",
    "our cognitive medium access problem belongs to the class of bandit problems . in this setting",
    ", the decision maker must sequentially choose one process to observe from @xmath22 stochastic processes .",
    "these processes usually have parameters that are unknown to the decision maker and , associated with each observation is a utility function .",
    "the objective of the decision maker is to maximize the sum or discounted sum of the utilities via a strategy that specifies which process to observe for every possible history of selections and observations .",
    "a comprehensive treatment covering different variants of bandit problems can be found in  @xcite .",
    "we are now ready to rigorously formulate our problem .",
    "the cognitive user employs a medium access strategy @xmath23 , which will select channel @xmath15 to sense at time slot @xmath7 for any possible causal information pattern obtained through the previous @xmath24 observations : @xmath25 _ i.e. _ @xmath26 .",
    "notice that @xmath27 is the sensing outcome of the @xmath28 time slot , in which @xmath29 is the channel being accessed . if @xmath30 , there is no accumulated information , and thus @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the utility that the cognitive user obtains by making decision @xmath16 at time slot @xmath7 is the number of bits it can transmit at time slot @xmath7 , which is @xmath33 .",
    "we denote the expected value of the payoff obtained by a cognitive user who uses strategy @xmath23 as @xmath34    we further denote @xmath35 , which is the largest throughput that the cognitive user could obtain when the spectral opportunities are governed by @xmath14 and the exact value of each realization of @xmath12 is not known _ a priori _ by the user .    each medium access decision made by the cognitive user",
    "has two effects .",
    "the first one is the short - term gain , i.e. , an immediate transmission opportunity if the chosen channel is found free .",
    "the second one is the long - term gain , i.e. , the updated statistical information about @xmath14 .",
    "this information will help the cognitive user in making better decisions in future stages .",
    "there is an interesting tradeoff between the short and long - term gains .",
    "if we only want to maximize the short - term gain , we can choose the channel with the highest availability probability to sense , based on the current information .",
    "this myopic strategy maximally exploits the existing information . on the other hand , by choosing other channels to sense , we gain statistical information about @xmath14 which can effectively guide future decisions .",
    "this process is typically referred to as exploration , as noted previously .",
    "more specifically , let @xmath36 be the updated pdf after making @xmath24 observations .",
    "we begin with @xmath37 . after observing @xmath27 , we update the pdf using the following bayesian formula .    1 .",
    "if @xmath38 , @xmath39 2 .",
    "if @xmath40 , @xmath41    the following result characterizes the optimal strategy that maximizes the average throughput the cognitive user obtains from the network .",
    "[ lem : optimal ] for any prior pdf @xmath42 , there exists an optimal strategy @xmath43 to the channel selection problem  , and @xmath44 is achievable .",
    "moreover , @xmath45 satisfies the following condition : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the conditional distribution updated using the bayesian rule described above , as if the cognitive user chooses @xmath48 and observes @xmath49 .",
    "also , @xmath50 is the value of a bandit problem with prior information @xmath47 and @xmath51 sequential observations .    in principle",
    ", lemma  [ lem : optimal ] provides the solution to problem  .",
    "effectively , it decouples the calculation at each stage , and hence , allows the use of dynamic programming to solve the problem .",
    "the idea is to solve the channel selection problem with a smaller dimension first and then use backward deduction to obtain the optimal solution for a problem with a larger dimension .",
    "starting with @xmath52 , the second term inside the expectation in   is 0 , since @xmath53 .",
    "hence , the optimal solution is to choose the channel @xmath3 having the largest @xmath54 , which can be calculated as @xmath55 and @xmath56 . with the solution for @xmath52 at hand , we can now solve the @xmath57 case using  . at first , for every possible choice of @xmath48 and possible observation @xmath58",
    ", we calculate the updated distribution @xmath59 using the bayesian formula .",
    "next , we calculate @xmath60 ( which is equivalent to the @xmath52 problem described above ) .",
    "finally , applying  , we have the following equation for the channel selection problems with @xmath57 : @xmath61f({\\hbox{\\boldmath$\\theta$}})d{\\hbox{\\boldmath$\\theta$}}.{\\nonumber}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , in the first step , the cognitive user should choose @xmath62 to sense .",
    "after observing @xmath63 , the cognitive user has @xmath64 , and it should choose @xmath65 .",
    "similarly , after solving the @xmath57 problem , one can proceed to solve the @xmath66 case . using this procedure recursively",
    ", we can solve the problem with @xmath51 observations .",
    "finally , our original problem with @xmath13 observations is solved as follows .",
    "@xmath67f({\\hbox{\\boldmath$\\theta$}})d{\\hbox{\\boldmath$\\theta$}}.{\\nonumber}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the optimal solution developed above suffers from a prohibitive computational complexity .",
    "in particular , the dimensionality of our search dimension grows exponentially with the block length @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , one can envision many practical scenarios in which it would be difficult for the cognitive user to obtain the prior information @xmath14 .",
    "this motivates our pursuit of low complexity non - parametric protocols which maintain certain optimality properties and do not depend on @xmath14 explicitly .",
    "hence , in the following , we aim to develop strategies that depend only on the information obtained through observations @xmath68 .    for a given strategy @xmath23 ,",
    "the expected number of bits the cognitive user is able to transmit through a block with given parameters @xmath12 is @xmath69    recall that @xmath70 means that , following strategy @xmath23 , the cognitive user should choose channel @xmath3 in time slot @xmath7 , based on the available information @xmath71 . here",
    "@xmath72 is the probability that the cognitive user will choose channel @xmath3 at time slot @xmath7 , following the strategy @xmath23 .",
    "compared with the idealistic case where the exact value of @xmath12 is known , in which the optimal strategy for the cognitive user is to always choose the channel with the largest availability probability , the loss incurred by @xmath23 is given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",
    "we say that a strategy @xmath23 is consistent if , for any @xmath75^n$ ] , there exists @xmath76 such that @xmath77 scales as @xmath78 . in the sequel ,",
    "we use the following notations 1 ) @xmath79 means that @xmath80 such that @xmath81 ; 2 ) @xmath82 means that @xmath83 and @xmath84 , such that @xmath85 @xmath86 .",
    "for example , consider a loyal scheme in which the cognitive user selects channel @xmath3 at the beginning of a block and sticks to it . if @xmath4 is the largest one among @xmath12 , @xmath87 . on the other hand , if @xmath4 is not the largest one , @xmath88 .",
    "hence , this loyal scheme is not consistent .",
    "the following lemma characterizes the fundamental limits of any consistent scheme .",
    "[ lem : lowerbound ] for any @xmath12 and any consistent strategy @xmath23 , we have @xmath89 where @xmath90 denotes the kullback - leibler divergence between the two bernoulli random variables with parameters @xmath4 and @xmath91 respectively : @xmath92    lemma  [ lem : lowerbound ] shows that the loss of any consistent strategy scales at least as @xmath93 .",
    "an intuitive explanation of this loss is that we need to spend at least @xmath94 time slots on sampling each of the channels with smaller @xmath4 , in order to get a reasonably accurate estimate of @xmath12 , and hence use it to determine the channel having the largest @xmath4 to sense .",
    "we say that a strategy @xmath23 is order optimal if @xmath95 .    before proceeding to the proposed low complexity order - optimal strategy",
    ", we first analyze the loss order of some heuristic strategies which may appear to be reasonable .",
    "the first simple rule is the random strategy @xmath96 where , at each time slot , the cognitive user randomly chooses a channel from the available @xmath0 channels .",
    "the fraction of time the cognitive user spends on each channel is therefore @xmath97 , leading to the loss @xmath98    the second one is the myopic rule @xmath99 in which the cognitive user keeps updating @xmath100 , and chooses the channel with the largest value of @xmath101 at each stage .",
    "since there are no convergence guarantees for the myopic rule , that is @xmath102 may never converge to @xmath12 due to the lack of sufficiently many samples for each channel  @xcite , the loss of this myopic strategy is @xmath103 .",
    "the third protocol we consider is _ staying with the winner and switching from the loser rule _",
    "@xmath104 where the cognitive user randomly chooses a channel in the first time slot . in the succeeding time - slots",
    "1 ) if the accessed channel was found to be free , it will choose the same channel to sense ; 2 ) otherwise , it will choose one of the remaining channels based on a certain switching rule .",
    "[ lem : sw ] no matter what the switching rule is , @xmath105 .",
    "there are several strategies that have loss of order @xmath94 .",
    "we adopt the following linear complexity strategy from  @xcite .",
    "( order optimal single index strategy )    the cognitive user maintains two vectors @xmath106 and @xmath107 , where each @xmath108 records the number of time slots in which the cognitive user has sensed channel @xmath3 to be free , and each @xmath109 records the number of time slots in which the cognitive user has chosen channel @xmath3 to sense .",
    "the strategy works as follows .    1 .",
    "initialization : at the beginning of each block , each channel is sensed once .",
    "2 .   after the initialization period",
    ", the cognitive user obtains an estimate @xmath102 at the beginning of time slot @xmath7 , given by @xmath110 and assigns an index @xmath111 to the @xmath112 channel .",
    "the cognitive user chooses the channel with the largest value of @xmath113 to sense at time slot @xmath7 .",
    "after each sensing , the cognitive user updates @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "the intuition behind this strategy is that as long as @xmath109 grows as fast as @xmath94 , @xmath114 converges to the true value of @xmath4 in probability , and the cognitive user will choose the channel with the largest @xmath4 eventually .",
    "the loss of @xmath115 comes from the time spent in sampling the inferior channels in order to learn the value of @xmath12 .",
    "this price , however , is inevitable as established in the lower bound of lemma  [ lem : lowerbound ] .",
    "finally , we observe that the difference between the myopic rule and the order optimal single index rule is the additional term @xmath116 added to the current estimate @xmath117 . roughly speaking , this additional term guarantees enough sampling time for each channel , since if we sample channel @xmath3 too sparsely",
    ", @xmath118 will be small , which will increase the probability that @xmath114 is the largest index .",
    "when @xmath118 scales as @xmath119 , @xmath117 will be the dominant term in the index @xmath114 , and hence the channel with the largest @xmath4 will be chosen much more frequently .",
