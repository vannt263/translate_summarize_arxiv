    "the evolution of the star formation density with redshift contains fundamental information from the perspectives both of galaxy evolution and of cosmology . at intermediate redshift , star formation rates ( sfrs )",
    "are estimated through a combination of uv , mid - ir , radio , and emission line techniques .",
    "lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) are used to estimate sfrs at high redshift .",
    "they are assumed to be related to fuv - selected samples selected via a color - color plane ( e.g. bouwens et al .",
    "2006 , reddy et al .",
    "a major issue in determining the star formation density is to cross calibrate the several tracers used to estimate the sfrs .",
    "this paper tests whether the star formation rate estimated from the far ultraviolet ( fuv ) continuum ( uv sfr or sfr@xmath15 ) of uv - selected galaxies is equivalent to that from the infrared luminosity from dust estimated by integrating over the wavelength range @xmath16 ( dust sfr or sfr@xmath17 , equivalently sfr@xmath18 ) .    even though we know that some dust is present in some lbgs ( e.g. chapman et al .",
    "2002 ) , it is difficult to get a direct estimate of how much in a statistically representative way because only a few lbgs at @xmath19 have been detected in the fir and in the sub millimeter ( submm ) ranges ( e.g. chapman et al . 2000 ) .",
    "even @xmath20 has not detected a large sample of @xmath19 lbgs in the regime where the dust emission is the main component of the spectrum ( e.g. huang et al . 2005 ) .",
    "adelberger & steidel ( 2000 ) concluded that the bulk of the submm background is produced by moderately obscured galaxies similar to the ones already detected in uv - selected surveys .",
    "most of the dust - to - fuv luminosity ratios ( @xmath12 ) for these galaxies are estimated from the observed optical and by using the uv slope vs. @xmath12 ( irx-@xmath21 ) relation defined by meurer , heckman & calzetti ( 1999 ) .",
    "however , the validity of this law is debated ( bell 2002 , buat et al .",
    "2005 , goldader et al .",
    "2002 ) . nevertheless , using this law , dust luminosities",
    "are often estimated without fir data ( e.g. adelberger & steidel .",
    "can we trust these results ?",
    "sawicki ( 2001 ) concluded that `` it is unlikely that a consensus about the amount of stellar light intercepted by dust will be reached on the basis of rest - frame uv and optical data alone '' .",
    "we therefore need rest - frame fir data to advance our knowledge of the dust content of uv - selected galaxies . in this paper",
    "we approach this goal by observing lbgs at @xmath7 where we can directly evaluate the dust luminosity from @xmath22 data .",
    "burgarella et al .",
    "( 2006b ) studied an initial sample of lbgs in the redshift range @xmath23 identified from @xmath0 data in the ultraviolet ; a portion of this sample was also detected with @xmath24 in the ir .",
    "the remainder are below the limiting mips flux density of @xmath25 .",
    "although this is a true lyman break sample at @xmath7 , the selection is different from lbgs at @xmath26 because the effect of the intergalactic medium is much lower at @xmath7 than at higher redshift .",
    "the same phenomenon applies , although at a lower level , for bm / bx galaxies selected at @xmath27 ( e.g. reddy et al .",
    "thus , although exact analogs of the high redshift lbgs can not be used , the main objective in the previous work was to define a rest - frame fuv - selected sample with a measured estimate of the dust luminosity from ir data .    in this paper ,",
    "we expand upon this approach .",
    "we describe the selection of the sample in section 2 .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the building and the analysis of the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of lbgs ( i.e. red lbgs ( rlbgs ) and blue lbgs ( blbgs ) ) and to their comparison to the seds of lbgs at @xmath28 .",
    "then , in section 4 , we will derive the luminosity function of the @xmath7 lbg sample and compare it to the luminosity function of an ultraviolet - selected sample . in section 5 , we will address the question of the total star formation density at @xmath7 and whether this total star formation density can be evaluated from an ultraviolet - selected sample , an infrared - selected sample or whether both of them are required . in section 6 , we will study the evolution of the @xmath12 ratio for uv - selected samples or , in other words , of the evolution of the dust attenuation with redshift .",
    "we will finish this paper in section 7 by estimating how we can detect lbgs in the infrared with facilities planned for the next decade .",
    "we assume a cosmology with @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 in this paper .",
    "our first paper ( burgarella et al .",
    "2006b ) on the lbg sample at @xmath7 used galex pipeline data . here , we use the deeper ( 76444 sec ) nuv image available in galex release 2 ( gr2 ) whose central coordinates are @xmath32 = 03h32m30.7s , and @xmath33 = -27deg5216.9  ( j2000.0 ) .",
    "an analysis of galex deep images shows that galaxies overlap , producing an apparent brightening of some of the detected objects in the tables available from the multi mission archive at stsci ( mast ) .",
    "this effect starts to apply to objects brighter than @xmath34 .    to deal with these effects systematically , we put all of our images at a common resolution and extracted photometry by means of point spread function fitting .",
    "the spatial resolution of the galex images was slightly degraded by applying a median 3x3 filtering to the fuv and nuv images .",
    "the galex `` beam '' is taken to be the solid angle of the 1@xmath35 radius circle of a gaussian point - spread function ( psf ) : @xmath36 as defined in hogg ( 2001 ) .",
    "note that for our galex analysis , @xmath37 arcsec which translates into @xmath38 arcsec .",
    "the final angular resolution in both bands therefore , matches the mips @xmath22 angular resolution .",
    "confusion noise is significant in these images ( see dole et al .",
    "2004 for 24@xmath39 m ) .",
    "the size of the filtered galex beam @xmath40 sr .",
    "since the total field of view of galex corresponds to @xmath41 sr , we obtain a confusion limit at @xmath42 :    @xmath43    or @xmath44 16 beams per source at the 80% completeness limit defined below for the nuv - selected sample .",
    "this is deeper than the criterion published by hogg ( 2001 ) of 20 beams per source but shallower than the @xmath44 12 beams per source estimated by dole et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and jeong et al .",
    "takeuchi & ishii ( 2004 ) have published a relation to estimate the confusion limit at @xmath45 .",
    "our number counts can be fitted by a power law with a slope @xmath46 . using @xmath47 and @xmath48",
    "as recommended by takeuchi & ishii ( 2004 ) , we can compute :    @xmath49    or 23 beams per source .",
    "accounting for the difference in detection level ( @xmath42 for the former and @xmath45 for the latter ) , the two values are consistent .",
    "we used daophot for photometry in these images with a psf built from 10 bright point sources in the fuv and nuv .",
    "daophot was developed for point sources .",
    "le floch et al .",
    "( 2005 ) show it is suitable to measure @xmath22 flux densities of spitzer / mips sources .",
    "our uv sources are restricted to the redshift range @xmath50 .",
    "de mello et al . ( 2006 ) showed that uv - selected galaxies in the redshift range @xmath51 have @xmath52 kpc i.e. fwhm @xmath53 kpc . at @xmath7",
    "this size corresponds to 0.7 arcsec .",
    "this is well below the angular resolution of our images , so we can safely use daophot for flux estimation in the targeted redshift range .",
    "we detect about @xmath54 objects in the nuv down to 3 @xmath35 with the daophot daofind task , which is in agreement with number counts by xu et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . using the daophot addstar task",
    ", we estimate the 80% completeness limit to be nuv=26.2 for the nuv - selected sample .",
    "the nuv - selected sample used hereafter corresponds to all objects with a nuv magnitude @xmath55 ; it contains 45366 objects in the galex field of view but only part of them have a combo 17 counterpart ( i.e. a redshift ) mainly because most galex objects lie outside the combo 17 field of view .",
    "this source density corresponds to @xmath44 16 beams per source , that is , just at the 3-@xmath35 confusion limit .    to check the validity of our approach",
    ", we also apply daophot phot aperture photometry ( integrated over 3 arcsec with an aperture correction estimated from the psf ) to a set of isolated objects ( i.e. no combo 17 counterparts within a 4-arcsec radius ) that we compare to daophot magnitudes for the same objects .",
    "the difference in magnitude ( daophot - phot ) amounts to @xmath56 which is about the uncertainty of a typical galex measurement ( morrissey et al .",
    "2005 ) given that we reach very faint magnitudes , confirming that daophot provides good estimates for the galex magnitudes .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "since the early works by steidel et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and madau et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , astronomers have tried to evaluate the cosmic star formation rate and its evolution with redshift from uv - selected galaxies .",
    "however , a correction for the dust attenuation must be applied to the uv measurements to obtain the total star formation density .",
    "the most widely used method is based on the meurer , heckman & calzetti ( 1999 ) @xmath8 relation , whose validity is still debated ( e.g. goldader et al .",
    "2002 , buat et al . 2005 ) .",
    "other methods have also been proposed ( e.g. kong et al .",
    "2004 , burgarella et al .",
    "burgarella et al.s ( 2006a ) two - colour method , estimated for a sample of normal and local galaxies , does not seem to provide good dust attenuation estimates , which might indicate different dust attenuation laws for these local galaxies than for higher redshift star - forming lbgs .",
    "burgarella et al .",
    "( 2006b ) presented a comparison of @xmath9 ( i.e. fuv + dust ) estimated from the fuv uncorrected for dust attenuation , the fuv corrected for dust attenuation using the @xmath8 method and from ir emission . in this paper , we update and complete this picture ( fig .",
    "the main result is that ir - based sfrs provide the best estimate for @xmath9 of rlbgs , which are the only lbgs for which we have a direct estimate of the total sfrs .",
    "this was expected since rlbgs are dominated by their ir emission .",
    "it will be interesting , though , to extend the diagram to lower sfrs to follow the evolution .",
    "iglesias - paramo et al .",
    "( 2006 ) performed a similar comparison at @xmath57 and found that @xmath58 and @xmath59 contribute about the same percentage to @xmath60 which is not inconsistent with an extrapolation from our present data . on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath8 method seems to provide , on average , a correct estimate of @xmath9 , even for ir - bright lbgs .",
    "however , the dispersion is much larger that for fir - based sfrs .",
    "buat et al . ( 2007b ) defined a sample of 190 lirgs at @xmath61 in the cdfs and compared it to a sample of 120 lirgs at @xmath57 extracted from buat et al .",
    "they found that the distribution of @xmath62 is different at the 95% level , as a result of different average fuv dust attenuations : @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "since the luminosity function of lbgs is statistically consistent with the luminosity function of a uv selection , we can compare @xmath62 for our objects to the uv - selected sample at @xmath13 of buat et al .",
    "( 2007a ) and the bm / bx fuv - selected sample at @xmath27 of reddy et al .",
    "unfortunately , buat et al.s sample does not extend far into the @xmath65 regime where galaxies lie at @xmath7 and @xmath27 , making a direct comparison impossible .",
    "however , buat et al.s fuv - selected and fir - selected samples do not show any difference up to @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , we adopt two values at @xmath13 for the sake of a redshift comparison of the ( @xmath67 ) ratio : first , we assume that we can extrapolate the fuv trend to higher @xmath68 through a linear regression and second we use the fir value . at @xmath69 ( i.e. a lirg ) ,",
    "the typical value of @xmath62 for the volume - corrected sample at @xmath13 is @xmath70 for the fir - selected galaxies and @xmath71 for the fuv - selected ones .",

    "we clearly observe a regular decrease of @xmath62 with redshift ( fig .",
    "what is the evolution beyond @xmath75 ?",
    "we need more data at all luminosities and , of course , a better coverage of the redshift scale .",
    "the evolution of this ratio will be a very powerful tool to bring us some constraint on the dust formation timescale and process in galaxies with , later on , some idea of where in the uv or fir we will have to look for high redshift star formation . ultimately , dust - free star formation might be observed at an unknown redshift depending on the time needed to form dust in star forming regions .",
    "we must stress , however , that this decrease is based on a uv - selected sample ( which is generally associated with lower stellar masses than ir - selected galaxies ) .",

    "will we be able to detect more uv - selected galaxies and lbgs at high redshift in the future ?",
    "the main limitation for deep observations in the fir are due to ( i ) thermal noise , ( ii ) cirrus and ( iii ) confusion limits ( helou & beichman 1990 , dole et al .",

    "the comparison is based on a 1h exposure time with a @xmath45 detection for all the instruments .",
    "the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) can detect rlbgs up to @xmath80 in 1h and can just detect blbgs at @xmath73 .",
    "a positive k - correction applies in the millimeter range but those objects are fainter even at low redshift and the k - correction does not help .",
    "a longer exposure time is necessary for detections at z @xmath81 1 .",
    "the herschel space telescope can detect the brightest rlbgs around @xmath82 but will not be able to detect fainter ones or higher redshift ones in 1h .",
    "deeper exposure times are also needed to broaden the spectral range . however , important information will be provided at the tip of the dust emission sed to further constrain the dust temperatures and tir luminosities .",
    "the european spica instrument ( esi ) on the japanese - led cryogenically - cooled telescope spica can take advantage of the low background to benefit from the low confusion - limit for a 4-m fir telescope .",
    "we assume , here , two kinds of detectors depending on which one will be available for esi in the mid-2010 frame : spitzer- or herschel - like photo - detectors ( goal ) or state - of - the - art photodetectors ( soap ) utilizing bolometers with transition edge superconductor temperature sensors ( tes ) ( swinyard et al .",

    "<S> ultraviolet ( uv ) galaxies have been selected from the @xmath0 deep imaging survey . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of a fuv - dropout in their spectral energy distributions proved to be a very complete ( 83.3 % ) but not very efficient ( 21.4 % ) tool for identifying lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath1 . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we explore the physical properties of these galaxies and how they contribute to the total star formation rate . </S>",
    "<S> we divide the lbg sample into two sub - classes : red lbgs ( rlbgs ) detected at @xmath2 which are mainly luminous ir galaxies ( lirgs ) and blue lbgs ( blbgs ) undetected at @xmath2 down to the mips / gto limiting flux density of 83 @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> two of the rlbgs are also detected at 70 @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the median sed of the rlbgs is similar ( above @xmath5 ) to that of a luminous dusty starburst at @xmath6 , hr10 . </S>",
    "<S> however , unlike local luminous and ultra luminous ir galaxies , rlbgs are uv bright objects . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that these objects contain a large amount of dust but that some bare stellar populations are also directly visible . </S>",
    "<S> the median sed of the blbgs is consistent with their containing the same stellar population as the rlbgs ( i.e. a 250 - 500 myrs old , exponentially decaying star formation history ) but with a lower dust content . </S>",
    "<S> the luminosity function of our lbg sample at @xmath7 is similar to the luminosity function of nuv - selected galaxies at the same redshift . </S>",
    "<S> the integrated luminosity densities of @xmath7 lbgs and nuv - selected galaxies are very consistent . making use of the rlbg sample , we show that star formation rates ( sfrs ) estimated from uv measurements and corrected using the @xmath8 method provide average total @xmath9 in agreement with the sum of the uv and infrared contributions : @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath8-based @xmath9 shows a large dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> summing up the detected uv ( @xmath11 rest - frame ) and ir - based star formation rates of the detected objects , we find that only one third of the total ( i.e. uv + dust ) lbg sfr resides in blbgs and two thirds in rlbgs , even though most lbgs at @xmath7 are blbgs . on the other hand , the total sfr of lbgs accounts for only 11% of the total sfr at @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we observe a regular decrease of the luminosity ratio @xmath12 from @xmath13 to @xmath14 for uv - selected samples .    </S>",
