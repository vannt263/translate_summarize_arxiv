    "technique of scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) enabled detailed study of metal layers with atomic resolution .",
    "an especially powerful tool for investigation of growth kinetics is the stm @xmath1-@xmath2 technique @xcite which allows direct monitoring of the layer as it grows .",

    "they are composed of metal dimers ( oriented parallel to the silicon dimers ) sitting in the `` trenches '' on the silicon surface @xcite .",
    "growth of the metal chains has been explained by a surface polymerization reaction @xcite .",
    "metal chain ends act as nucleation centers .",
    "since the sites adjacent to a chain are energetically unfavorable for adsorption ( no adsorption has been observed there ) the chains grow only in length .",
    "the chains are always separated by a distance of at least 2a ( a@xmath3 nm , surface unit cell spacing ) .",
    "thus , the surface is saturated by metal adatoms at a coverage of 0.5 ml ( 1  ml@xmath4 @xmath5 ) .",
    "some differences exist between various group iii metals .",
    "while al and ga chains are believed to be stable at room temperature @xcite , indium atoms are known to detach from chains and re - attach to other chains @xcite and tl chains were shown to be even more unstable @xcite . though a qualitative description of diffusion and growth processes for group iii metals exists , the corresponding values of microscopic parameters are not known .",
    "the heights of diffusion barriers on si(100 ) have not been yet determined for in and the values reported by albao @xmath6 @xcite for ga and by brocks @xmath6 @xcite for al are very different .",

    "recently kocn @xmath6 reported @xcite that detachment of indium atoms from chains is length dependent , so interactions other than nearest  neighbor ( nn ) might play a role .",
    "the role of surface defects present on the si(100)-2@xmath01 surface @xcite at the metal adsorption and nucleation was reported and discussed @xcite .",
    "experimental results showed that influence of a- and b - type defects ( one and two missing dimers , respectively ) can be neglected but c - type defects are important .",
    "the c - type defects , which appear on stm images as a small bright protrusion next to a dark spot in filled states and as a larger bright spot in empty states , are reported to be very reactive and act as nucleation centers @xcite .",
    "the c - defects were independently interpreted by hossain @xmath6@xcite and okano and oshiyama @xcite as dissociated h@xmath8o molecules , with the h and hydroxyl group bonded to neighboring silicon atoms of two adjacent surface dimers .",
    "the results both of experimental and theoretical study of in nucleation at the c - defects were reported in ref .  .",
    "after adsorption of an in adatom at a c - defect ( exclusively on the unoccupied side of the two adjacent si dimers ) the chain begins to grow in one direction only ( see fig .  1 in ref .  ) .",
    "the chain termination at the defect is stable , the opposite `` free '' end is active as an adsorption site for adatoms .",

    "an unconventional monotonously decreasing scaled island ( chain ) size distribution function obtained for low coverage was explained by an irreversible growth model and kinetic monte carlo ( kmc ) simulations .",
    "the simulations resulted in the monotonous size distribution only if highly anisotropic surface diffusion of ga adatoms was introduced otherwise a monomodal form of the distribution function was obtained .",
    "the presence of c - defects included later @xcite did not change the results significantly .",
    "similar growth characteristics at rt we reported for indium @xcite .",
    "the chain length distributions obtained for various coverages are monotonously decreasing and obey a scaling relation .",
    "most of in chains ( 6090 % ) in observed layers were on at least one end terminated by a c - type defect . in the @xmath1-@xmath2 experiments the percentage was higher , 90100 % ( due to low deposition rates of in during the @xmath1-@xmath2 measurements ) .",
    "density of indium chains and average chain length depend on c - defect concentration .",
    "another phenomenon ( observed at higher coverage ) is that indium atoms are able to migrate throughout sites adjacent to an indium chain even though no adsorption is observed ( such an effect seems to be negligible at low coverage ) .    in this paper",
    ", we use stm data and kmc simulations for detail studying indium growth on the reconstructed surface si(100)-2@xmath01 .",
