    "as part of the class radio survey @xcite reported the discovery of a new gravitational lens ( gl ) candidate , b1600 + 434 , with an image separation of @xmath4 and a flux ratio of @xmath5 at 8.4 ghz .",
    "traditionally , gravitationally lensed images are expected to have identical colours due to the achromatic nature of gravitational lensing . in this letter",
    "we report our findings from optical multicolour observations of this system obtained at three epochs which reveal a large colour difference between the two components .",
    "the observing log is given in table  [ tab : obslog ] .",
    "for the observations we used the ccd cameras brocam 1 ( epochs 1 and 2 ) and brocam 2 ( epoch 3 ) .",
    "brocam 1 is equipped with a thinned backside illuminated tek1024 ccd with a gain of @xmath6 , a readout noise of @xmath7 and a pixel scale of @xmath8 .",
    "brocam 2 applied a thinned loral 2048 ccd with @xmath9 , @xmath10 and a pixel scale of @xmath11 .",
    "a finding chart of the object and stars in the field is shown in figure  [ fig : findchart ] , including the three stars used as internal calibration and point - spread function ( psf ) stars . in what follows we label the northern image of b1600 + 434 as image a and the fainter southern image as image b ( cf .",

    ".dates and combined exposure times [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     the uncertainty in the b band magnitudes is approximately 45 times greater than those in the other filters .",
    "apart from this filter the remaining bands show a consistent variation .",
    "due to the uncertainties in the measurements it is difficult to identify whether the detected variation is due to an intrinsic flux variation of the qso or a micro - lensing event .",
    "@xcite indicated flux variability in their radio data and this is clearly supported by our optical data .",
    "@xcite introduced a radially symmetric galaxy model to give rough estimates for the mass and time - delay in the qso 0957 + 561 system .",
    "we apply their model to estimate the lensing mass and time - delay between image a and b in b1600 + 434 .",
    "the lensing galaxy is very close to the position of the b component and we found that the separation between image a or b and the lens along the vector connecting a and b is @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the cosmological correction factor , t , is found in @xcite for the lens and source redshifts and a flat friedmann universe model ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 is used throughout this letter ) .",
    "we assume there is no additional shear from a cluster or other galaxies ( @xmath16 ) and that the lens has an isothermal mass distribution ( @xmath17 ) . inserting the observational values into equation ( 15b ) of @xcite",
    "gives a time - delay of @xmath18 days .",
    "the enclosed mass inside the angular radius @xmath19 ( the einstein radius ) is found using their equation ( 11 ) and gives @xmath20 m@xmath21    as the lensing galaxy of this system is relatively bright it is straightforward to estimate the mass - to - light ratio .",
    "we measure the galaxy luminosity within a radius of @xmath19   from the galaxy center and compute the rest - frame absolute luminosity .",
    "the rest - frame luminosity of the galaxy is estimated using the method described in @xcite ; note that there is a sign error in their definition of the conversion constants @xmath22 . from the observed",
    "v , r and i colours ( given in table  [ tab : lensgal ] ) we find the rest - frame b and v magnitudes at @xmath23 to be @xmath24 and @xmath25 . assuming @xmath26 the corresponding absolute magnitudes are @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "this gives mass - to - light ratios of @xmath29 and @xmath30 in solar units for the rest - frame b and v bands , respectively .",
    "these relatively high m / l estimates are , however , affected by various effects . edge - on spiral galaxies commonly have dust lanes which significantly obscure the luminous matter in the galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the seeing smears out the light inside the restricted aperture used and the psf photometry unavoidably introduces errors with a tendency for oversubtraction .",
    "our mass - to - light ratios should consequently be taken as upper limits .",
    "infrared observations of b1600 + 434 with hst would offer an optimal measurement of the true lens galaxy m / l .",
    "we find that a @xmath31 nearly edge - on spiral galaxy acts as the lens in b1600 + 434 and causes a significant reddening of image b , due to dust obscuration .",
    "the reddening of image b is unusually strong and may in general have implications on lensing statistics , because most optically discovered gl candidates are chosen by their colour similarity ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "small deviations in the relative magnitude for a given filter is usually allowed , but a difference of the order of one magnitude or more will probably result in that object being discarded as a gl candidate . the failure to detect all gl candidates in a sample will introduce systematic effects which affect the results of the statistical analysis .",
    "@xcite discussed various bias effects in optical gravitational lens surveys and concluded that 1030 % of all gl systems are lost already in the process of identifying the qsos . however , this is a rough estimate which depends on the selection criteria of the qso sample . indeed , in view of the results presented here , the number of unidentified gl systems in optical qso / gl surveys is difficult to estimate .",
    "if most of the gl systems discovered so far are produced by early - type ellipticals this could be explained by the fact that optically thick spiral galaxies tend to redden one of the ( two ) lensed images , thereby causing many spiral lensed systems from being detected in optical surveys .",
    "radio selected samples are much less affected by such selection effects and may consequently reveal more spiral lenses .",
    "in fact b1600 + 434 is the second radio - selected spiral lens galaxy discovered at not by our group , the first being b0218 + 357 ( @xcite ) and both systems show signs of significant extinction .",
    "our variability analysis indicates a variation of about 0.25 mag year@xmath32 .",
    "the lens system b1600 + 434 may therefore be an interesting candidate for determining the time - delay and @xmath33 .",
    "we estimate the theoretically expected time - delay to be of the order of one month .",
    "it should be noted , though , that the shear effects of the se galaxy may affect the lensing and should probably be accounted for in a realistic model of the lens potential ."
