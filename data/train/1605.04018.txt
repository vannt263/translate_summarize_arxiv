    "let @xmath0 be the number of steps required by quicksort algorithm to sort the list of values @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a random permutation chosen with uniform probability from the set of all permutations @xmath3 of order @xmath4 .",
    "it has been proven by @xcite and @xcite that the appropriately scaled distribution of @xmath0 converges to some limit law @xmath5 as @xmath6 .",
    "let us denote as @xmath7 the characteristic function of the limiting distribution @xmath8 @xcite proved that the characteristic function @xmath7 has a density @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite using heuristic approach established a number of very precise estimates for the behavior of @xmath9 at infinity .",
    "later @xcite showed that the characteristic function @xmath7 of the limit quicksort distribution together with its all derivatives decrease faster than any polynomial at infinity .",
    "more precisely they showed that for all real @xmath10 there is such a constant @xmath11 that @xmath12 they also proved that @xmath13 hence @xmath14 the infimum in the above inequality can be evaluated as latexmath:[\\[|f(t)|\\leqslant \\inf_{p>0}\\frac{2^{p^2 + 6p}}{|t|^p}\\leqslant |t|^3 e^{-\\frac{\\log^2     the main result of this paper is the following theorem stating that the characteristic function @xmath7 of limiting quicksort distribution decreases exponentially at infinity .",
    "[ main_thm ] there is a constant @xmath16 such that @xmath17 as @xmath18 .",
    "[ cor ] quicksort distribution has a bounded density that can be extended analytically to the vicinity of the real line @xmath19 . where @xmath20 is the same positive number as in the formulation of theorem [ main_thm ] .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the characteristic function @xmath7 satisfies the functional equation @xmath21 which after a change of variables @xmath22 becomes @xmath23 it follows hence by taking laplace transform of the both sides that function @xmath24 satisfies an equation @xmath25 the laplace transform @xmath26 together with the above differential equation will be the main tool of proving the result stated in the introduction .",
    "it is well known that the quicksort distribution has finite moments of all orders . in the following analysis",
    "we will only need the fact that it has finite first moment , which implies that @xmath27 is bounded . thus integrating by parts we conclude that @xmath28 for all @xmath29 lying in the right half - plane @xmath30 and @xmath31 being some positive absolute constant .      the proof is done by applying mathematical induction on @xmath4 and using the fact that the differential equation for @xmath26 allows us to express the derivatives @xmath34 as a polynomial function of @xmath35 with @xmath36 .",
    "indeed , for @xmath37 the above inequality becomes an identity .",
    "suppose this identity holds for all @xmath4 not exceeding @xmath38 .",
    "let us consider now @xmath39 .",
    "replacing the first derivative of @xmath26 by @xmath40 we obtain @xmath41 thus applying the inductive hypothesis to the derivatives of @xmath42 we get @xmath43 the last inequality is the same as stated in the lemma with @xmath39 .",
    "this completes the proof of the lemma        our upper bound ( [ upper_bound_for_psi ] ) for @xmath26 implies that for @xmath30 and @xmath44 we have @xmath48 since imaginary part of @xmath29 is negative so @xmath49 . using this inequality to evaluate the right hand side of the inequality of lemma [ lem_ineq ] we complete the proof of the lemma .",
    "the function @xmath26 can be continued analytically to the whole complex plane .",
    "moreover , for all @xmath29 belonging to the lower half - plane @xmath50 and @xmath51 with any fixed @xmath52 holds the estimate @xmath53    for @xmath54 the estimate of the proposition already follows from ( [ upper_bound_for_psi ] ) . by this estimate of lemma [ lem_psi ]",
    "we have that the taylor series @xmath55 converges in the circle @xmath56 and moreover in this circle holds the estimate @xmath57 this means that @xmath26 can be analytically continued to the region of complex plane that consists of such @xmath29 that are contained in any of the circles of radius @xmath58 with center at @xmath59 with some @xmath60 .",
    "note that all complex number @xmath29 with negative imaginary part such that @xmath61 satisfy such condition .",

    "we have already proven that for @xmath66 we have @xmath67 when @xmath68 with an arbitrary fixed @xmath69 .",
    "let us now try to obtain a similar estimate for the values of @xmath29 lying in the upper half - plane .",
    "the proof of the lemma relies on a standard trick that is used to prove that if a modulus of a characteristic function of a random variable reaches @xmath72 at some point other than @xmath73 then the random variable has a lattice distribution .",
    "we have @xmath74 for @xmath70 .",
    "note that the estimate [ upper_bound_for_psi ] for fixed @xmath70 implies that @xmath75 as @xmath76 which means that the supremum of @xmath77 will be reached on some finite point @xmath78 .",
    "it remains to prove that this supremum can not be equal to @xmath79 .",
    "indeed if @xmath80 then recalling the definition of @xmath81 we can rewrite this identity as @xmath82 or equivalently @xmath83 for some real @xmath84 . since @xmath85 taking the real part of the above equation we have @xmath86 the above identity together with the fact that @xmath87 implies that @xmath88 and thus @xmath89 which means that @xmath90 however such function does not satisfy the equation @xmath91 .        applying the inequality of lemma [ bound_sup ] with @xmath97 we have @xmath98 for all @xmath99 and some fixed @xmath100 .",
    "hence inequality of lemma [ lem_ineq ] yields that @xmath101 uniformly for @xmath99 .",
    "this implies that @xmath26 is bounded in the vicinity of the imaginary line @xmath102 where @xmath103 .",
    "indeed by taylor expansion @xmath104 thus @xmath105 for @xmath106 .",
    "suppose @xmath107 then taking @xmath108 we get @xmath93 for all @xmath29 lying in the strip @xmath107 .",
    "putting @xmath97 in our non - uniform bound ( [ upper_bound_for_psi ] ) for @xmath26 we have @xmath113 for some fixed @xmath114 . again by induction for @xmath115 we have @xmath116 suppose @xmath117 .",
    "let us take @xmath108 . combining the above upper bound with our previous uniform estimate ( [ psi_derivatives_bound ] ) for the derivatives of @xmath118 we get @xmath119 for @xmath117 and @xmath120 .",
    "since @xmath121 we have @xmath122      the laplace transform of @xmath123 is @xmath124 so , by inversion formula we have @xmath125 and taking into account that @xmath126 in the region @xmath127 for some fixed @xmath128 we can shift the integration line to the left and obtain @xmath129    the density is given by formula @xmath130 the fact that @xmath7 is exponentially decreasing @xmath131 at infinity @xmath18 immediately implies that the integral @xmath132 is absolutely convergent in the vicinity of the real line @xmath133 where it defines an analytic function that coincides with the density of the quicksort distribution @xmath9 on the real line @xmath134 .",
    "since an analytic function that is not identically equal to zero can have only finite number of zeros in any closed circle @xmath135 for any @xmath136 , so the density @xmath9 can have only finite number of zeros in any finite interval @xmath137 $ ] with all @xmath136 .",
