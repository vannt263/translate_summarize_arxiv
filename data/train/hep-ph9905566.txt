    "recent results on the next - to - leading @xmath6 corrections  @xcite to the bfkl equation  @xcite and to the hard pomeron show subleading effects which are so large as to question the very meaning of the high - energy expansion and thus raise the compelling question of how to improve it .",
    "two facts suggest that an essential ingredient of any improvement of the bfkl approach should be the correct treatment of the collinear behavior , as predicted by the renormalization group ( rg ) : on the one hand the success of normal qcd evolution  @xcite in explaining the @xmath7 dependence of the small-@xmath0 behavior of structure functions at hera , and on the other hand the observation that the large next - to - leading corrections to the bfkl equation come mostly from collinearly - enhanced physical contributions .",
    "a first attempt at introducing collinear improvements was performed long ago , by the treatment of coherence effects  @xcite in the collinear region .",
    "this leads to the ccfm equation  @xcite , which differs from the bfkl equation by subleading effects to all orders , even if a full inclusion of the dglap splitting functions in a consistent ccfm framework has not yet been achieved .",
    "other modified bfkl approaches incorporating some dglap evolution are being tried too  @xcite .",
    "very recently , it has been suggested  @xcite that such all - order collinear effects can be incorporated as subleading kernels of a generalized equation , whose solution can be found by the method of the so called @xmath1-expansion , allowing in particular a resummation of the energy - scale - dependent terms of the kernel  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to insert such suggestions in a general scheme , which leads to the renormalization group improved small-@xmath0 equation , and to study its solutions .",
    "one of the outcomes will be to stabilize , in a nearly scheme - independent way , the estimate of the anomalous dimensions and of the @xmath7-dependent hard pomeron .",
    "a first point to clear up is which pomeron we are going to estimate .",
    "previous work on rg factorization  @xcite in the bfkl equation with running coupling  @xcite has shown that the _ pomeron _ @xmath4 defined as the @xmath7-independent leading singularity in the @xmath1-plane , is beyond the reach of a strictly perturbative approach .",
    "on the other hand , there appears to be a boundary of validity of the rg , the @xmath7-dependent _ hard pomeron _ @xmath8 , which is argued to be _ independent _ of the small-@xmath9 strong coupling region and is thus hopefully calculable in perturbative qcd .",
    "since @xmath8 signals a change of asymptotic regime , it is associated with an @xmath1-singularity of the anomalous dimensions , not necessarily of the full gluon distribution .",
    "thus @xmath8 may be related to a power - like behavior in an intermediate small-@xmath0 , moderate @xmath7 region , and not to the very small-@xmath0 asymptotic behavior of the structure functions .",
    "it also follows that @xmath8 is a rather difficult quantity to determine , because it is related to the position of an @xmath1-singularity , and is thus dependent on the full anomalous dimension perturbative series .",
    "possible definitions , leading to a precise estimate , are thoroughly discussed in sec .",
    "[ s : sxefgk ] and in sec .",
    "[ s : adhp ] , where our results are provided .",
    "a second point to realize is that , in order to incorporate the collinear behavior correctly , a whole string of subleading kernels , represented by a series in the running coupling @xmath10 , is to be taken into account .",
    "in fact , the leading @xmath6 calculations count one high - energy gluon exchange per power of @xmath11 , with any transverse momentum ratios . in the collinear limit , provided by the strong",
    "ordering in the transverse momenta , only the singular part @xmath12 of the dglap splitting function is obtained .",
    "the remaining part contributes to higher and higher order subleading kernels which carry fewer powers of @xmath6 , but leading powers of @xmath13 . from a quantitative point of view , such collinear contributions are very important , and in fact account for most of the exact nl kernel ( sec .",
    "let us stress that we are not aiming here at a full control of subleading @xmath6 contributions , but only of those that carry a leading collinear contribution from nnl level on .",
    "therefore , we remain in a context in which only @xmath14-channel iteration is important , without mixing with the @xmath15-channel one ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .    in this framework , we can define the @xmath16-dependent gluon distribution by the nl @xmath16-factorization formula introduced by one of us  @xcite in large @xmath16 dijet production in parton - parton scattering . in a general hard process involving probes @xmath17 and @xmath18 we can write  @xcite @xmath19 where the impact factors @xmath20 , @xmath21 may carry additional dependence on the hard scales of the probes and the gluon green s function is provided by @xmath22^{-1}|{{\\boldsymbol k}}_0\\rangle   \\ , , \\label{defg}\\ ] ] apart from the multiplicative kernels @xmath23 , @xmath24 which may be needed at subleading level  @xcite .",
    "we notice immediately that the scale of the energy @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ fatt ] ) has been chosen to be @xmath25 , i.e. , factorized and symmetrical in the `` upper '' ( @xmath26 ) scale @xmath27 and `` lower '' ( @xmath28 ) scale @xmath29 .",

    "( [ defg ] ) are both symmetrical operators . on the other hand , when @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) , the variable @xmath34 _ is not _ the correct scaling variable , which is rather @xmath35 ( @xmath36 )  i.e. the usual bjorken variable .    in order to switch to , say , the upper energy - scale @xmath37",

    "( [ fatt ] ) that one has to perform a similarity transformation @xmath38 , which in turn implies the relationship @xmath39 between the symmetrical kernel @xmath31 and the kernel @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) .",
