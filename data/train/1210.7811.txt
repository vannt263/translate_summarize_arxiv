    "observations in the gev range of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) by the fermi lat @xcite instrument have uncovered new peculiarities of these objects , which were unknown previously . among the minority of bursts which show significant emission above 100 mev @xcite",
    ", we concentrate here on a handful of bursts with substantial detected gev emission to construct models aimed at interpreting the radiation and the basic parameters of the bursts .",
    "the bursts with observed gev emission have rather diverse spectra .",
    "so far , because of relatively low number of such grbs , we restrict ourselves only to bursts which have a large enough data coverage to make detailed model fits meaningful . in general terms , the gev emission in some bursts can be described through an extrapolation of the lower energy spectrum , without strong evidence for departures from this , while in other bursts an extra power law component emerges at gev energies , in addition to the spectral component describing the mev radiation .",
    "an important new feature present in both short and long bursts is the presence of a delay between the mev and the gev radiation .",
    "furthermore , some bursts also exhibit strong spectral evolution .",
    "the origin of the gev component has been attributed to leptonic mechanisms in the external forward shock , e.g. in the radiative regime in a pair enriched interstellar medium @xcite or in the adiabatic regime @xcite , or alternatively to hadronic cascades ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , among others . in the external forward shock ,",
    "inverse compton scattering and klein - nishina effects were considered by @xcite , and it has been argued that at least the first few seconds of the early high energy emission can not be attributed to the forward shock @xcite .",
    "thus , it is important to consider both the prompt ( largely mev ) emission and the gev emission jointly , as they interact with each other .",
    "two recent developments which are relevant for the prompt emission are the increasing consideration of magnetically dominated models for the grb outflow , and of photospheric models for the formation of the prompt radiation spectrum ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "previously , we have shown that some of the brightest detected bursts can be modelled by a magnetic two component model @xcite .",
    "we showed that within this model , without going into detailed model fits , it is possible to incorporate the seemingly different behaviors of the high - energy spectrum ( which is either a single band function or a band function with an extra high energy component ) into a single framework .",
    "we also addressed the non - detection problem of bursts by lat , namely some of the grbs should have been detected by lat if the spectrum continues smoothly from the mev regime , or generally there is lack of lat detected bursts compared to initial estimates , based on the simple extrapolation of the mev emission .",
    "we have also presented a generalized formalism for the dynamics of grbs valid for a generic acceleration law @xmath2 with @xmath3 @xcite , where @xmath1 can be understood as a parameter accounting for the bulk lorentz factor @xmath4 averaged across the effective cross section of the jet at that radius .    here",
    "we present detailed numerical fits of the mev and gev data to specific physical models of grbs based a photospheric origin of the prompt emission in two dynamic regimes , i.e. the extreme magnetically dominated regime and the usual baryonically dominated regime , with inclusion of the inverse scattering effects ( both self and external ) incurred in the external forward and reverse shocks .",
    "this is one of the few instances of fitting grb spectra with physically detailed models ( for other examples see @xcite ) .",
    "we construct the models based on the generalized dynamics described above , and convolve them with the response function of the detectors , showing that they give a good statistical description of the data .    in this paper , we analyze four representative bursts , which capture the diversity observed in lat : grbs 080916c , 090510 , 090902b and 090926a .",
    "we model their spectrum with the two component magnetic ( @xmath5 ) model and demonstrate that it is a viable model to interpret the spectra from approximately 10 kev to 10 gev .",
    "we also show that the baryonic model ( @xmath6 ) gives similarly good fits to the data , as quantified by specific goodness of fit criteria .",
    "we present our basic model in  2 .",
    "the fermi observational data for the four grbs and the fitting method are described in  3 .",
    "the fitting results are presented in  4 .",
    "we summarize the results and compare the baryonic with the magnetic model , with a discussion on the physical implications , in  5 .",
    "our basic model consists of a dissipative photosphere , whose location depends on whether the dynamics there is kinetic energy dominated or magnetically dominated , and an external shock region , where reverse shocks may be present as well as a forward blast wave .",
    "the bulk of the prompt mev radiation arises from the neighborhood of the photosphere in the form of a nonthermal component , and depending on the model , a separate , subdominant thermal component can also be evident . at the deceleration radius , shock accelerated electrons upscatter the prompt photons to produce a component peaking in the gev range .    in the present paper",
    "we generalize the model presented in to cover a wider range of dynamic behavior stretching from the extreme kinetic energy dominated to the extreme magnetic dominated cases .",
    "the acceleration of the ejecta is described by the expression ( [ eq : accel ] ) for the bulk lorentz factor @xmath7 here the exponent @xmath1 is taken as @xmath5 when the dynamics is governed by dissipation of the energy stored in magnetic fields in the presence of a sub - dominant inertia of the baryonic component ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while if the baryonic component dominates , we have @xmath6 . intermediate values of @xmath1 can arise in magnetic outflows with certain symmetries , and the exact value of @xmath1 also depends on the magnetic field configuration ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 are the saturation ( coasting ) and the deceleration radii , and with this parametrization the radius where the ejecta reaches the coasting lorentz factor is @xmath10 . for simplicity",
    "we consider the transition from the acceleration phase to coasting as a broken power law function , although this transition occurs more gradually ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in what follows",
    "is it is useful to give the dependence of the physical parameters in terms of a general @xmath1 .",
    "the main difference between the models is whether the photosphere occurs below or above the saturation radius .",
    "this is governed by the relation of @xmath11 and a quantity @xmath12 given by eq.([eq : etat ] ) . here",
    "@xmath12 is a limiting value for the lorentz factor , which separates the two cases of @xmath13 ( photosphere below saturation ) and @xmath14 ( photosphere above saturation , where @xmath12 is a function of the dynamics , depending on @xmath1 .",
    "this limiting lorentz factor is obtained from setting @xmath15 for a general @xmath1 , generalizing the related value introduced in @xcite , @xmath16 the photosphere occurs in the acceleration phase if @xmath13 , typical for a magnetically dominated ( @xmath5 ) case , where @xmath17 .",
    "the photosphere is in the coasting phase for @xmath14 which it is typical for baryonic cases ( @xmath6 ) for which @xmath18 .",
    "the two radii are equal for @xmath19 if other nominal parameters are left unchanged .",
    "the photosphere will occur at @xmath20 noting that @xmath21 carries an @xmath22 dependence for @xmath13 .",
    "the lorentz factor at the photosphere is @xmath23 for @xmath13 and @xmath24 in other cases .",
    "the shell has initially a constant width , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the time during which the central engine is active . at a later stage",
    "the shell starts to spread radially when the when the relative width @xmath27 becomes of the same order as the initial shell width @xmath28 .",
    "depending on the regime , this can happen at @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "for most of the parameters used here the spreading occurs well beyond the saturation radius , @xmath31 , and it can be neglected close to the photosphere .",
    "the scaling of the baryon number density in the comoving frame is @xmath32 this results in a dependence : @xmath33 if @xmath34 or @xmath35 if @xmath36 .",
    "prompt spectrum : observationally the prompt emission spectrum is described by a band function @xcite , and a spectrum with broadly similar attributes is shown to arise in photospheres @xcite .",
    "the location of the peak of the spectrum may be due to effects related to electron heating by nuclear collisions , reconnection , or semirelativistic shocks , all of which give the peak energy at the right order of magnitude",
    ". a detailed radiative transfer would be model - dependent and too cumbersome for performing numerical fits to the data .",
    "for the purposes of this study we choose a simple prescription where the peak energy is determined by the synchrotron peak from mildly relativistic shocks around the photosphere .",
    "it should be noted however , that the above is just a simple heuristic prescription for the peak , the shape being taken to be the band shape .",
    "the band spectra and peaks deduced in the previously mentioned numerical simulations arise from distortions of the original black - body component formed around the launching radius through compton scattering and synchrotron radiation , which escapes at the photosphere . in these cases",
    "no additional black - body component is expected below the peak . in our model",
    "considered here the peak is ascribed to synchrotron radiation from electrons accelerated near the photosphere , which introduces a dependence on the magnetic field ; and the advected blackbody component is also released , but at energies typically below the peak , for magnetically dominated dynamics .",
    "there are possible shortfalls for a pure synchrotron interpretation , such as the low energy spectral slope observations which show inconsistencies with the synchrotron model when electrons are in the fast cooling regime ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "while recent analyses @xcite show that the fraction of bursts showing problems is smaller then previously thought , there is still a non - negligible fraction of bursts where other mechanisms may need to be invoked",
    ". this could be the compton upscattering mentioned above , or modifications of the simple synchrotron mechanism , e.g. such as discussed by @xcite .",
    "a first principles discussion of such cases for our fitting exercise undertaken here on individual bursts would be too extensive , and for this reason we have adopted the simple prescription mentioned above .    the peak of the prompt spectrum is then given by @xmath37 $ ] , where @xmath38 ( taking @xmath39 from eq .",
    "[ eq : nb ] ) and @xmath40 @xmath41 here we have assumed an efficiency of 0.5 @xcite .",
    "the two cases imply widely different values for the same set of parameters .",
    "this is mainly caused by the strong dependence on @xmath11 when the photosphere arises in the coasting phase ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "note furthermore , that the photosphere loses any memory of the acceleration in the same case and no @xmath1 dependence is present .",
    "also in this case , the peak energy is independent of the launching radius .",
    "we take the low and high energy photon number indices from observations ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) , and in the fitting sections we directly fit for these .",
    "thermal component : even though the main emission component is nonthermal , one expects a thermal component to arise from the photosphere",
    ". there are hints of this separate thermal component emerging below the band peak @xcite .",
    "the comoving temperature goes as @xmath44 if @xmath45 and @xmath46 if @xmath47 this results in a dependence of the observed temperature as : @xmath48    external shock - related components : the ejecta starts to decelerate when it has plowed up approximately @xmath49 times its own mass from the interstellar matter .",
    "this occurs at the deceleration radius @xmath50 . here",
    "@xmath51 is the fraction of the luminosity in radiation , which for simplicity is fixed to @xmath52 throughout the rest of this article . at the deceleration radius a forward shock develops ( and possibly a reverse shock as well ) .",
    "the prompt emission is up - scattered on the shock - accelerated electrons , giving rise , to a @xmath53 peaked radiation .",
    "this component dominates at sufficiently high energies , but radiation from synchrotron self compton ( ssc ) from the forward shock ( fs ) may also be relevant here .",
    "the deceleration radius is larger than the photospheric and the saturation radius for every realistic set of parameters .",
    "currently there are at least 40 lat - detected grbs at energies @xmath54 mev @xcite . out of these , there are only a handful of bursts with enough data at @xmath55 energies to derive meaningful constraints on the model parameters @xcite . in this paper",
    "we choose four of such bright lat grbs , namely , grb 080916c , 090510 , 090902b and 090926a as our sample .",
    "we processed the fermi gbm and lat data using the same method as presented in @xcite . for each burst , we choose the 1 - 2 brightest gbm spectra and 1 or 2 bgo spectra together with lat spectrum to compare with our model .",
    "we have fixed the bgo normalization factor , accounting for differences between detectors effective area , to the usual value of @xmath56 @xcite .    by varying the free parameters , we get the best models which can reproduce the observed count spectrum . for the total duration of the bursts we managed to fit grbs 080916c and 090510 with our model . for grbs 090926a and 090902b",
    ", our model did not give a satisfactory fit when considering the entire duration of the burst , but time resolved spectra were well fitted by our model .",
    "we put this on the account of the strong spectral evolution present in these two grbs as published in their initial discovery papers .",
    "we have taken the theoretical model described above with 9 free parameters .",
    "we fit the data using the simplex method implemented in the _ amoeba _ routine ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) modified , in some of the cases with simulated annealing ( erik rosolowsky , private communication ) .",
    "this addition makes the method less sensitive to local minima .",
    "the parameters describe the spectrum of a photospheric model ( either magnetic or baryonic ) .",
    "the procedure is to convolve the model with the detectors response functions and compare this result with the observed counts . for this purpose ,",
    "we have written our own idl codes to handle both the observed count spectrum , the instrumental response matrix ( drm ) and read in the multi - parameter theoretical model to carry out the fitting .    because the number of fitting parameters is large ,",
    "we introduce some additional constraints , in accordance with the model .",
    "we require the deceleration time to be of order of few seconds , which corresponds to the delay between the mev and gev components .",

    "090510 @xcite noted a correlation between the kev range radiation and the gev radiation ( but no correlation with the mev radiation ) .",
    "based on their spectrum , the additional power - law would be the responsible for explaining this correlation .",
    "in the framework of this generalized photospheric model , such a correlation can be explained if these two components have a common source : e.g. the kev emission is ascribed to the forward shock ( fs ) synchrotron and the gev to the forward shock synchrotron - self compton ( fs - ssc ) ; or if a reverse shock is present ( as proposed in this work ) , the kev radiation can be due to the reverse shock synchrotron - self compton ( rs - ssc ) and the gev is produced by the reverse shock external inverse compton ( rs - eic ) .    _",
    "conclusions.- _ in summary , we have shown that a simple dissipative photosphere model of the prompt emission of grb based on synchrotron radiation can fit well the joint fermi gbm and lat data for the four brightest bursts with sufficiently detailed information .",
    "we have introduced a general formalism for treating the jet acceleration dynamics ranging between an extreme magnetically dominated to a baryon dominated dynamics regime .",
    "both types of dynamics give acceptable fits to the data on these four bursts .",
    "additional considerations involving statistical trends over a much larger sample of bursts might favor slightly the magnetic models , but firm conclusions would require detailed fits over much larger samples than undertaken here .",
