    "simulations of the microwave sky play a crucial role in accurately extracting constraints on cosmology potentially measurable by current and upcoming microwave background observatories , such as the atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) , the south pole telescope ( spt ) , and the planck satellite .",
    "these surveys will have complex data processing pipelines and analysis strategies , and any artifacts caused by any one of the many analysis steps can best be controlled by simultaneously running simulations of the microwave sky , with known cosmological and astrophysical inputs , through the same analysis pipeline .",
    "these microwave background experiments , which will have finer resolution and higher sensitivity than achieved to date , can potentially constrain cosmological parameters via their measured microwave power spectrum , higher order correlation functions , sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) cluster detections , and cross - correlation studies of various microwave components . moreover , these microwave data sets can be combined with surveys at other wavelengths to yield additional constraints . as such , the accurate recovery of known cosmological inputs , through the variety of methods mentioned above , must be tested with simulations .",
    "this necessitates high - resolution , cosmological - scale , microwave simulations that include the most accurate astrophysical components as our current observations will allow .",
    "the microwave sky consists primarily of the following components : ( 1 ) the primordial microwave background , which is lensed by the intervening structure between the last scattering surface and observers today , ( 2 ) the thermal sz signal from the hot gas in galaxy clusters , groups , and the intergalactic medium , ( 3 ) the kinetic sz signal from the bulk motion of galaxy clusters , groups , and the intergalactic medium , ( 4 ) higher - order relativistic corrections to the thermal and kinetic sz signals , ( 5 ) a population of dusty star forming galaxies that emit strongly at infrared wavelengths but have significant microwave emission , ( 6 ) a population of galaxies that emit strongly at radio wavelengths , including active galactic nuclei , which also have significant emission at microwave frequencies , and ( 7 ) dust , synchrotron , and free - free emission from the galaxy .",
    "the simulations discussed here include the above components , mapped at six different frequencies : 30 , 90 , 148 , 219 , 277 , and 350 ghz .",
    "the frequencies 148 , 219 , and 277 are the central act observing frequencies , as these simulations are used by the act team to inform their data analysis pipeline .",
    "the additional frequencies have been added to widen the applicability of these simulations to other microwave background experiments .",
    "the only components listed above that have been excluded from the microwave maps are the galactic synchrotron and free - free emission .",
    "these two components are not expected to be significant at act frequencies , and we leave their inclusion to future work .",
    "the maps themselves are full - sky healpix  maps of resolution 0.4 arcminutes ( nside=8192 ) and consist of full - sky maps of each component separately as well as a combined sky map , at each frequency .",
    "these healpix  maps can be interpolated into flat sky maps using the bilinear interpolation subroutine included in the healpix distribution @xcite .",
    "in addition , catalogs of all the halos in this simulation and their various properties , as well as catalogs of the individual infrared and radio galaxies that populate the halos , are provided .",
    "these simulations are public and can be downloaded from http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/toolbox/tb_cmbsim_ov.cfm .",
    "there are of course many simulations of components of the microwave sky ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the simulations discussed here include the components mentioned above , in an internally consistent manner , matched to the most recent observations .",
    "these simulations have improved upon the previous simulations discussed in @xcite in the following ways : +    * radio and infrared galaxy populations are clustered and correlated with the galaxy cluster populations * the primordial microwave background has been lensed by the dark matter structure in the n - body simulation via a ray - tracing code * the contribution to the kinetic sz signal from the intergalactic medium has been included , in addition to that from galaxy clusters * the gas prescription to model the sz signals has been refined to match the most recent x - ray observations * maps have been created at a wider range of frequencies to increase the applicability to other microwave background experiments * standard healpix  format for the maps has been adopted    we give a brief summary of the key elements of these simulations below , which we expand upon in greater detail throughout  2 and  3 .",
    "the large - scale structure simulation was carried out using a tree - particle - mesh code @xcite , with a simulation volume of @xmath9 on a side containing @xmath10 particles .",
    "the cosmology adopted is ( @xmath11 ) = ( 0.044 , 0.264 , 0.736 , 0.71 , 0.96 , 0.80 ) , consistent with the wmap 5-year results @xcite .",
    "the mass distribution covering one octant of the full sky was saved , and halos with a friends - of - friends mass above @xmath12 and with a redshift below @xmath13 are identified .",
    "the octant is then replicated to create a full - sky simulation .",
    "thus the large - scale structure components in these simulations are unique for one octant , while the primary microwave background and galactic dust are modeled for the full sky .",
    "the primary microwave background has the same cosmology as the large - scale structure and matches the wmap 5-year internal linear combination map @xcite on large - scales ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the microwave background is then lensed by the large - scale structure in the simulation with a ray - tracing code @xcite .",
    "the sunyaev - zeldovich signal is derived by adding a gas prescription to the n - body halos which assumes a polytropic equation of state and hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "this model , which is described in more detail in @xcite , adjusts four free parameters which are calibrated against x - ray gas fractions as a function of temperature from the sample of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these four free parameters are the star formation rate ( which depends on the halo mass and redshift ) , non - thermal pressure support ( from cosmic rays or magnetic fields ) , dynamical energy transfer from dark matter to gas ( a depletion factor which lowers the average baryon fraction to less than the cosmic mean ) , and feedback from active galactic nuclei ( which is tied to the star formation rate ) .",
    "this model describes the gas prescription for halos with friends - of - friends mass @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "smaller halos down to @xmath12 and the intergalactic medium for @xmath16 are treated with a different method .",
    "the velocity dispersion of a given simulation particle is calculated using its neighbors , and this velocity dispersion is related to the pressure ( and thus the thermal sz signal ) via a proportionality constant derived from hydrodynamical simulations @xcite .",
    "the kinetic sz is calculated from the line - of - sight momentum of the particles . for the @xmath17 universe",
    ", the temperature is assumed to be isothermal at @xmath18 , and mass density and momentum shells at various redshift slices are used to construct the thermal and kinetic sz signals .",
    "the infrared source model has six parameters used to populate halos , and is partially based on @xcite .",
    "this model satisfies the following observational constraints : the cobe / firas background as in @xcite is an upper limit on the total infrared intensity , the effective spectral index for the spectral intensity is @xmath19 between 145 and 350 ghz @xcite , source counts are compatible with scuba counts at 353 ghz @xcite , source counts and clustering are compatible with blast measured counts and power spectrum @xcite , and the power of the infrared sources is below the point source upper limit derived by acbar at 150 ghz , fixing @xmath20 to the wmap 5-year measurement @xcite .    the model for the radio sources",
    "is made by creating a halo occupation distribution and luminosity distribution for radio sources at 151 mhz to match the 151 mhz radio luminosity function ( rlf ) at @xmath21 .",
    "151 mhz was chosen because at such low frequencies the rlf is dominated by the steep spectrum lobes of the radio sources ( as opposed to the flatter spectrum cores ) and is thus less sensitive to biases due to orientation effects .",
    "once the 151 mhz rlf is matched at low redshifts , the radio sources are divided into two populations , similar to the types i and ii of the @xcite classification .",
    "these are given differing number density evolutions with redshift , and the rlf at higher redshift is matched to observations .",
    "we use a relativistic beaming model to separate how much of a source s flux at 151 mhz is from the core as opposed to the lobes , and we adjust the shape of the radio core spectral energy distribution to match source counts at @xmath22 mhz , where the core dominates @xcite .",
    "the galactic dust emission maps are from the `` model 8 '' prediction from @xcite , which @xcite show to be a reasonable template for dust emission in the wmap maps .",
    "in  [ sec : sims ] , we discuss the construction of each component of these simulations and comparison to observations in more detail . in  [ sec : discuss ] , we discuss further properties of the simulated maps , and in  [ sec : concl ] , we summarize and conclude .",
    "we follow the method of @xcite , constructing a primary microwave background map with the observed large - scale structure and small scale structure consistent with theoretical expectations . for large scales",
    ", we use the wmap 5-year internal linear combination ( ilc ) map @xcite . for @xmath14 , we take the harmonic coefficients ( @xmath23 ) from the ilc map with no modification . at smaller scales , where the ilc map is smoothed significantly ,",
    "a gaussian random realization is added , so that the ensemble average power equals the theoretical power spectrum which maximizes the wmap 5-year likelihood .",
    "harmonic coefficients are computed to @xmath24 , and we synthesize a map with healpix parameter @xmath25 ( 0.859  pixels ) . then we convert to a map with healpix parameter @xmath26 ( 0.429  pixels ) using the ` alter_alm ` subroutine included in the healpix distribution @xcite . the lower resolution",
    "( @xmath25 ) map is used to generate the lensed microwave background map ( see   [ sec : lensing ] ) , as that is more efficient than working with the @xmath26 map directly and results in no significant loss of accuracy .",
    "the lensed map is then also converted to an @xmath26 map .",
    "a simulation of the large - scale structure of the universe is performed using the same methods as previously described in @xcite and @xcite , and we refer the reader to their papers for additional details . within a periodic box of comoving side length @xmath27 ,",

    "this simulation has been previously used by @xcite in developing a model for the intracluster medium .",
    "a putative observer at redshift zero is placed at one corner of the periodic box , and the mass distribution along a past light cone , covering one octant ( box coordinates @xmath31 ) of the sky , is saved as the simulation is running . to create full - sky maps this octant",

    "for @xmath16 all of these particles are saved to disk and for @xmath35 pixelized versions of the shells are saved , as described below .",
    "there are 579 such shells in all ; the range @xmath36 of each shell depends on the time step size set by the tpm code .",
    "it decreases from @xmath37 at @xmath38 to @xmath39 at @xmath40 , and to @xmath41 for @xmath8 . for comoving distances larger than the box size , @xmath42",
    ", there can be some duplication in structures as the periodic box is repeatedly tiled .",
    "this tiling is done without random rotations to preserve the periodicity and prevent discontinuities in the large - scale structure .",
    "however , any repetition is usually at a different redshift and evolutionary state . in cases where a halo or filament appears twice at similar redshifts",
    ", it is viewed at two different angles , making each projected image unique .",
    "for all the shells ( @xmath35 ) particles are subdivided by angular coordinates using the healpix scheme for pixelation of a sphere .",
    "the projected mass and momentum in each pixel of the shell are computed and saved to disk ( as described previously in * ? ? ?",
    "these pixelized shells are used to model the gravitational lensing (  [ sec : lensing ] ) and high - redshift sz distortion (  [ sec : sz ] ) of the microwave background .    for lower redshifts",
    "@xmath16 , the positions and velocities of all particles in the light cone are also saved to disk for postprocessing .",
    "the approximately 55 billion particles thus saved occupy 1.3 tb of disk space and are used to model the sz effect (  [ sec : sz ] ) in detail .",
    "a friends - of - friends ( fof ) halo finder , with a standard linking length @xmath43 equal to 1/5 of the mean interparticle spacing , is used to identify dark matter halos and tag the particles belonging to them .",
    "this halo catalog is used to model infrared (  [ sec : ir ] ) and radio (  [ sec : radio ] ) point sources .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dndz ] , the halo mass functions measured from particles in the light cone agree well with the semi - analytic fitting formula from @xcite for a linking length @xmath44 . the number of halos above a minimum mass per unit redshift per square degree is plotted for four minimum masses : @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "the first limit , the equivalent of 100 particles , is the lowest mass of halos that are populated with point sources .",
    "the second value corresponds to massive halos with enough resolution to model the intrahalo gas in greater detail . for any cluster survey ,",
    "the minimum detectable mass is likely to be a function of redshift , and the last two minimum mass values reflect the range expected for upcoming sz surveys .",

    "we present the salient aspects of a full - sky microwave background lensing simulation at arcminute resolution .",

    ", we generate a surface mass density plane ( expressed in mass per steradian ) by dividing the total mass in a pixel by the solid angle subtended by it .",
    "we then subtract the cosmological mean of the surface density to generate a surface overdensity on each shell .",
    "we then generate the effective convergence map ( @xmath50 ) up to the maximum redshift in the large - scale - structure simulation ( @xmath51 ) by combining the surface overdensities in the octant shells with proper geometrical weighting ( see , eqns .",

    "to accurately lens the microwave background , we need to include the contribution to the convergence from redshifts beyond the farthest simulated shell ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "we do this by adding in a gaussian random realization for this extra convergence based on a theoretical convergence power spectrum ( calculating the contribution to the convergence power from @xmath52 structure ) . at the end of this process",

    "there are two things worth noticing in the plot : the large scatter at the low multipole end of the power spectrum , and the excess power in the simulation beyond @xmath61 .",
    "the scatter is expected because we generated the full - sky convergence map by replicating an octant .",
    "the apparent high multipole excess is a consequence partly of the nonlinear corrections to the theory slightly underpredicting the nonlinear power , and partly of the shot noise due to the discrete nature of the particles .",

    "observations suggest we should expect some preference for radio and infrared galaxies to reside in galaxy clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) , and these sources could potentially fill in the sz decrement at frequencies below the null .",

    "if these sources reside preferentially in massive clusters , a significant portion of the sz signal could be masked out and a biased determination of @xmath20 would arise .",
    "here we investigate , via these simulations , the fraction of sz clusters that may be substantially contaminated by radio or infrared galaxy populations .",
    "we first add the flux of all galaxies of a given population residing in a given halo .",
    "then , using each galaxy cluster s integrated sz flux within @xmath278 ( in units of mjy ) , we calculate the fraction of halos whose combined flux from resident galaxies equals @xmath4 or more of the halo s sz flux decrement at 30 , 90 , and 148 ghz .",
    "such halos will be harder to detect by sz surveys , and their signal is more likely to be masked out in attempts to measure the sz power spectrum .",
    "we choose a @xmath4 contamination fraction as that is roughly where the uncertainty in the expected sz flux for a cluster of a given mass becomes dominated by point source contamination as opposed to the intrinsic scatter in the @xmath311 relation or projection effects .    for the contamination due to radio sources , we find that for halos with @xmath327 , roughly @xmath2 or less of clusters with @xmath328 have their sz flux decrement at 148 ghz filled in by more than @xmath4 ( see fig .
