    "the study of a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) exposed to a high - frequency electromagnetic field is one of the most excited areas in the modern physics of nanostructures .",
    "the permanent interest to this topic originates from rich fundamental and applied capabilities of two - dimensional electron systems ( see , e.g. , refs .  [ ] ) .",
    "particularly , the magnetoelectronic properties of 2deg subjected to a microwave irradiation are actively studied during last years @xcite .",
    "however , the most attention on the subject was paid before to the simplest case of weak electromagnetic field which does not change electron states .",
    "namely , the only effect of the weak field is the field - induced electron transitions between the unperturbed states . on the contrary",
    ", a strong electromagnetic field can substantially mix electron states . as a result of this mixing",
    ", the composite electron - field object `` electron dressed by field '' ( dressed electron ) appears @xcite .",
    "the light - induced renormalization of physical properties of dressed electrons has been studied in various atomic systems @xcite and condensed - matter structures , including bulk semiconductors @xcite , quantum wells @xcite , quantum rings @xcite , graphene @xcite , etc . in the present research",
    ", we develop the theory describing the magnetic properties of dressed 2deg and demonstrate that they can be substantially modified by the dressing field .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the second section ,",
    "we solve the schrdinger equation for a 2deg subjected to both a stationary magnetic field and a high - frequency dressing field . in the third section",
    ", the found solutions of the schrdinger problem are used to analyze various magnetoelectronic characteristics of dressed 2deg , including density of electron states and magnetotransport .",
    "the last sections contain conclusions and acknowledgments .",
    "let us consider a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) confined in the @xmath0 plane , which is subjected to both a stationary magnetic field , @xmath1 , directed along the @xmath2 axis and a linearly polarized electromagnetic wave ( dressing field ) propagating along the same axis @xmath2 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of 2deg reads as     ( color online ) sketch of the system under consideration : two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) subjected to both a linearly polarized electromagnetic wave ( em ) with the electric field amplitude , @xmath3 , and a stationary magnetic field , @xmath4 , directed perpendicularly to the 2deg plane . ]",

    "it should be noted that the field - induced terms in the wave functions ( [ psi])([phi ] ) do not depend on the landau level number , @xmath27 .",
    "this means that the dressing field does not change the structure of landau levels .",
    "however , the dressing field produces exponential phase shifts in the wave functions ( [ psi])([phi ] ) . in the absence of a magnetic field , similar phase shifts strongly effect on transport characteristics of dressed 2deg via the renormalization of electron scattering @xcite . since the phase shifts in eqs .",

    ", the field should be purely dressing ( nonabsorbable ) . in the considered electron system , there are the two mechanism of absorption of the field by electrons : ( i ) the resonant absorption of the field , which corresponds to electron transitions between different landau levels ; ( ii ) the collisional absorption of the field , which corresponds to electron transitions between different states within the broadened landau level . to exclude the first mechanism , the field frequency , @xmath10 , should be far from the resonant frequencies , @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) , corresponding to interlevel electron transitions . to exclude the second mechanism , the photon energy , @xmath53 ,",

    "it follows from the aforesaid that these terms can be neglected if the dressing field is both off - resonant and high - frequency .",

    "the only effect of the field is the suppression of electron scattering , which results in decreasing both the broadening of landau levels and the longitudinal conductivity ( see figs .  2 and 3 ) .",
    "thus , a high - frequency irradiation and a low - frequency one lead to different behavior of the magnetoelectronic properties of 2deg .",
    "it should be noted also that the magnetoelectronic effects induced by a dressing field strongly depends on the kind of electron dispersion . in dirac materials with linear electron dispersion ,",

    "this well - known methodology has been elaborated long ago and commonly used to observe various dressing effects  particularly , modifications of energy spectrum of dressed electrons arisen from the optical stark effect  in semiconductor structures ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) . within this approach , giant dressing fields ( up to gw/@xmath89 )",
    "can be applied to semiconductor structures .",
    "summarizing the aforesaid , we can conclude that a strong high - frequency electromagnetic field ( dressing field ) decreases the electron scattering between different cyclotron orbits within the same landau level . as a consequence ,",
    "the field decreases the scattering - induced broadening of landau levels in 2deg .",
    "this results in the field - induced modification of various magnetoelectronic properties depending on the density of electron states ( particularly , magnetotransport characteristics of 2deg ) .",
    "therefore , a dressing field can be considered as a perspective tool to manipulate the magnetoelectronic properties of various two - dimensional nanostructures .",
