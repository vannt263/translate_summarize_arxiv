    "ferrofluids are colloidal suspensions of single domain ferromagnetic grains dispersed in a solvent . the stabilization of such suspensions is usually obtained by coating the magnetic particles with polymer or surfactant layers or by using electric double layer formation . since each particle of a ferrofluid possesses a permanent magnetic dipole moment , upon integrating out the degress of freedom of the solvent , which gives rise to effective pair potentials , dispersions of ferrocolloids can be considered as paradigmatic realizations of dipolar liquids @xcite .",
    "the effective interactions of such magnetic particles are often modeled by dipolar hard - sphere ( dhs ) @xcite , dipolar yukawa @xcite , or stockmayer @xcite interaction potentials .",
    "the most frequently applied methods to describe ferrofluids encompass mean field theories @xcite , thermodynamical perturbation theory @xcite , integral equation theories @xcite , various dfts @xcite , as well as monte carlo @xcite and molecular dynamics @xcite simulations .    within the framework of dft and the mean spherical approximation ( msa ) ,",
    "previously we have proposed an analytical equation @xcite for the magnetic field dependence of the magnetization of _",
    "one_-component ferrofluids , which turned out to be reliable as compared with corresponding monte carlo ( mc ) simulation data . for this kind of system",
    "the effect of an external magnetic field has been taken into account by a dft method , which approximates the free energy functional of the anisotropic system with an external field by a second - order taylor series expansion around the corresponding isotropic reference system without an external field .",
    "the expansion coefficients are the direct correlation functions which for the studied isotropic dipolar hard - sphere ( dhs ) and dipolar yukawa reference systems can be obtained analytically from refs .",
    ".    however , in practice the magnetic colloidal suspensions are often multicomponent . in order to describe the magnetization of ferrofluidic _ mixtures",
    "_ we extend our one - component theory to multicomponent systems .",
    "this extension is based on the multicomponent msa solution obtained by adelman and deutch @xcite .",
    "they showed that the properties of equally sized hard spheres with different dipole moments can be expressed in terms of those of an effective single component system .",
    "because msa is a linear response theory adelman and deutch could predict only the initial slope ( or zero - field susceptibility ) of the magnetization curve . using their msa solutions as those of a reference system , in the following we present dft calculations of the _ full _ magnetization curves of equally sized , dipolar hard sphere mixtures .",
