    "<S> the thermodynamic quantities ( spin - spin correlation functions @xmath0 , correlation length @xmath1 , spin susceptibility @xmath2 , and specific heat @xmath3 ) of the frustrated one - dimensional @xmath4-@xmath5 heisenberg ferromagnet with arbitrary spin quantum number @xmath6 below the quantum critical point , i.e. for @xmath7 , are calculated using a rotation - invariant green - function formalism and full diagonalization as well as a finite - temperature lanczos technique for finite chains of up to @xmath8 sites . </S>",
    "<S> the low - temperature behavior of the susceptibility @xmath2 and the correlation length @xmath1 is well described by @xmath9 and @xmath10 with @xmath11 and @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the vanishing of the factors in front of the temperature at @xmath13 indicates a change of the critical behavior of @xmath2 and @xmath1 at @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the specific heat may exhibit an additional frustration - induced low - temperature maximum when approaching the quantum critical point . </S>",
    "<S> this maximum appears for @xmath15 and @xmath16 , but was not found for @xmath17 . </S>"
