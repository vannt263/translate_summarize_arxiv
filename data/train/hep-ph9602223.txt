    "however , the same approach , when applied to the @xmath0 or @xmath17 production at the tevatron , severely underestimates the productions rate @xcite . in order to reconcile the data and pqcd predictions , a new mechanism for heavy quarkonium productions has been suggested @xcite , the color - octet gluon fragmentation into @xmath0 .",

    "it is important to test this idea in other high energy processes with inclusive heavy quarkonium productions . up to now , the following processes have been considered : @xmath0 production at the tevatron and fixed target experiments @xcite @xcite @xcite , spin alignment of the color - octet produced @xmath0 @xcite , the polar angle distribution of the @xmath0 in the @xmath33 annihilations into @xmath34 @xcite , inclusive @xmath0 production in @xmath35 meson decays @xcite and the @xmath36 decays at lep @xcite .",
    "these processes also depend on the aforementioned three color - octet matrix elements in different combinations from ( 1.4 ) .",

    "@xcite is important , and/or ( ii ) the heavy quark spin symmetry for @xmath233 may not be a good approximation . although the heavy quark spin symmetry relation is used quite often in heavy quarkonium physics , it may be violated by a considerable amount @xcite .",
    "recently , fleming _",
    "_ performed the @xmath234 fit to the available fixed target experiments and the hera data independently , and found that @xmath235 using the mrsa@xmath236 , and cteq3 m structure functions with @xmath237 and @xmath238 gev .",
    "this determination is not compatible with the relation ( 1.4 ) , since the resulting @xmath239 is negative .",
    "this is another way to say that the determination of the color - octet matrix elements from the @xmath0 productions at the tevatron may not be that reliable .",
    "in fact , this is not very surprising , since the radiative corrections to the lowest - order color - singlet contributions to @xmath0 hadronic productions are not included yet .",
    "next , we consider @xmath0 photoproductions through @xmath43 parton - level subprocesses . as discussed at the end of sec .",
    "[ subsec:3a ] , the pqcd corrections to the lowest order @xmath240 is not under proper control for @xmath241 .",
    "therefore , we impose a cut @xmath242 at emc energy , @xmath243 gev , and at hera with @xmath244 gev , we impose cuts on @xmath7 and @xmath163 @xcite : @xmath245 in both cases , we set @xmath177 .    in figs .  7 ( a ) and ( b ) , we show the @xmath196 distributions of @xmath0 at emc ( nmc ) and hera along with the corresponding data . in both cases ,",
    "the color - octet @xmath246 contribution ( compton scattering type ) is negligible in most regions of @xmath7 , and thus can be safely neglected .",
    "the thick dashed and the thin dashed curves correspond to the cases where the relation ( 1.4 ) is saturated by @xmath247 and @xmath248 , respectively .",
    "the thick and the thin solid curves represent the sum of the color - singlet and the color - octet contributions , in case that the relation ( 1.4 ) is saturated by @xmath249 and @xmath250 , respectively . in either case , we observe that the color - octet @xmath251 and @xmath252 contributions begin to dominate the color - singlet contributions for @xmath253 , and become too large for high @xmath7 region considering we have not added the enhancements at high @xmath7 due to the relativistic corrections .",
    "thus , this behavior of rapid growing at high @xmath7 does not agree with the data points at emc and hera , if we adopt the determination ( 1.4 ) by cho and leibovich @xcite .    in figs .",
    "8 ( a ) and ( b ) , we show the @xmath163 distributions of @xmath0 at emc and hera , respectively . we find that the color - octet contributions through @xmath43 subprocesses become dominant over the color - singlet contributions for most @xmath163 region . also , the color - octet contributions from @xmath251 and @xmath252 are more important than the charm quark fragmentation considered by godbole _",
    ". however , this situation may be due to the overestimated color - octet matrix elements as alluded in the previous paragraph . in fig .",
    "9 , we show the inelastic @xmath0 photoproduction cross section as a function of @xmath9 with the cut , @xmath254 and @xmath174 .",
    "again , the color - octet @xmath246 contribution is too small , and thus not shown in the figure . here again , the color - octet @xmath251 and @xmath252 contributions via @xmath43 subprocesses ( fig .",
    "3 ) dominate the color - singlet contribution , if the relation ( 1.4 ) is imposed .",
    "although the total seems to be in reasonable agreement with the preliminary h1 data , direct comparison may be meaningful only if the cascade @xmath0 s from @xmath92 decays have been subtracted out .",
    "there are also considerable amount of uncertainties coming from @xmath255 and @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to say that the color - octet @xmath251 and @xmath252 state dominate the singlet contribution to @xmath0 photoproduction , if the relation ( 1.4 ) is imposed .      finding that the color - octet matrix elements determined from @xmath0 productions at the tevatron seem to be too large in case of @xmath0 photoproductions at fixed target experiments and hera , it is timely to consider the color - octet contributions to inclusive @xmath35 meson decays into @xmath257 again . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a new factorization formula is derived for @xmath53 : @xmath258 with @xmath259 two numbers @xmath260 and @xmath261 are the wilson coefficients of the @xmath262 effective weak hamiltonian . using the relation ( 1.4 ) , we estimate the above branching ratio to be ( for @xmath263 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath264 which is larger than the recent cleo data by an order of magnitude : ] although the discrepancy gets milder than the case ( 4.4 ) . ]",
    "@xmath265 the situation is the same for @xmath266 .",
    "this is problematic , unless this large color - octet contributions are canceled by the color - singlet contributions of higher order in @xmath154 which were not included in ref .  @xcite .",
    "if there are no such fortuitous cancelations among various color - octet and the color - singlet contributions , this disaster could be attributed to the relation ( 1.4 ) being too large compared to the naive velocity scaling rule in nrqcd , as noticed in ref .",
    "it seems to be crucial to include the higher order corrections of @xmath267 for the color - singlet @xmath0 productions at the tevatron , which is still lacking in the literature .",
    "in summary , we considered the color - octet contributions to ( i ) the subprocess @xmath268 through @xmath269 and the subsequent evolution of @xmath270 into a physical @xmath0 with @xmath41 and @xmath271 , ( ii ) the subprocesses @xmath272 .",
    "these are compared with ( i ) the measured @xmath0 photoproduction cross section in the forward direction , and ( ii ) the @xmath7 distributions of @xmath0 at emc and hera , and the preliminary result on the inelastic @xmath0 photoproduction total cross section at hera .",
    "one finds that the relation ( 1.4 ) color - octet lead to too large contributions of the color - octet @xmath251 and @xmath252 states to the above observables .",
    "especially , the first two observables contradict the observation .",
    "this is also against the naive expectation that the color - octet contribution may not be prominent as in the case of the @xmath0 hadroproductions , since they are suppressed by @xmath40 ( although enhanced by one power of @xmath24 ) relative to the color - singlet contribution .",
    "it is also pointed out that the same is true of the process @xmath273 , in which the relation ( 1.4 ) predicts its branching ratio to be too large by an order of magnitude compared with the data .",
    "therefore , one may conclude that the color - octet matrix elements involving @xmath274 might be overestimated by an order of magnitude .",
    "since the relation ( 1.4 ) has been extracted by fitting the @xmath0 production at the tevatron to the lowest order color - singlet and the color - octet contributions , it may be changed when one considers the radiative corrections to the lowest order color - singlet contributions .",
    "while we were finishing our work , there appeared two papers considering the same subject @xcite @xcite .",
    "our results agree with these two works where they overlap .",
    "this work was supported in part by kosef through ctp at seoul national university .",

    "in this appendix , we give explicit expressions for the invariant amplitude squared for the color - octet @xmath43 subprocesses shown in figs .  1 and 3 .",
