    "at the heart of the theory of general relativity is einstein s equivalence principle ( ep ) .",
    "the weak equivalence principle predicts the composition independence of the accelerations of test masses in a gravitational field .",
    "this has been probed at a present sensitivity of @xmath1 in innovative and difficult experiments @xcite .",
    "further tests of this principle remain important and relevant for new physics @xcite .",
    "we are fortunate that there are several initiatives to push the sensitivity several orders of magnitude further using new space - based experiments such as microscope @xcite , the galileo galilei project @xcite and step @xcite as well as new types of experiments using cold atoms @xcite and sub - orbital rockets @xcite .",
    "one possible source of ep violation is a very light scalar field with a coupling to matter that is weaker than gravitational strength .",
    "we will refer to these generically as ` dilatons ' , although they may have origins other than string theory or models involving dilation symmetry . as will become clear below",
    ", we will phenomenologically define a ` dilaton ' as a scalar field @xmath2 whose couplings to matter effectively introduce a @xmath2 dependence in the basic dimensionless constants of nature ( such as the fine - structure constant etc . ) .",
    "string theory may have such scalars in the low energy limit ( string dilaton , moduli ) , and these can naturally lead to ep violation at a sizeable level @xcite .",
    "likewise , theories of quintessence predict a light scalar , as do theories with continuously varying coupling constants as well as some theories of dark matter .",
    "while scalars lead to an attractive interaction , like usual gravity , they do not couple _ universally _ to all forms of energy in the same way as in general relativity .",
    "thus we expect differences in the forces for different elements .",
    "additionally , independently of any specific theoretical model one might argue ( along the ` anthropic ' approach to the issue of a possibly extremely vast ` multiverse ' of cosmological and/or string backgrounds ) that : ( i ) the ` equivalence principle ' is not a fundamental symmetry principle of nature ( e.g. it is ` violated ' in any theory containing very light scalars ) ; ( ii ) the level @xmath3 of ep violation can be expected to vary , quasi randomly , within some range _ of order unity _",
    ", over the full multiverse of possible ( cosmological and/or theoretical ) backgrounds ; ( iii ) as there is probably a maximal level of ep violation , say @xmath4 , which is compatible with the development of life ( and of physicists worrying about the ep ) , one should a priori expect to observe , in our local environment , an ep violation @xmath5 of order of @xmath6 .",
    "it is a challenge to give a precise estimate ( or at least upper bound ) of @xmath6 .",
    "we note , however , that this is a scientifically rather well - posed challenge .",
    "for instance , one of the necessary conditions for the existence of life is the existence of solar - like planetary systems stable over billions of years .",
    "a sufficiently large @xmath7 will jeopardize this stability , notably under the influence of external , passing stars .",
    "the current very small level of ep violation ensures that stars passing at a distance @xmath8 disturb the inner dynamics of the solar system only through tidal effects that decrease like @xmath9 .",
    "an ep violation @xmath5 would increase this disturbing effect to a level @xmath10 .",
    "it is also a well - posed question to determine the level @xmath5 which would destabilize the solar system through internal ep - violating gravitational effects .    independently of these various motivations",
    ", our work here will discuss the general type of composition - dependence of ep violation that is entailed by the existence of a light dilaton - like field .",
    "the theoretical challenge is to connect the basic couplings of the dilaton lagrangian to the properties of real atomic systems .",
    "our work starts in section 2 with a review of ep violations , and a general parameterization of possible dilaton couplings , eq .",
    "( [ lint ] ) .",
    "section 3 connects dilaton coupling parameters with the other couplings of the standard model , which is preparation for understanding the effects of the dilaton couplings .",
    "section 4 is our analysis of the effects in nuclear binding , while section 5 is a summary of the effects within individual nucleons , and section 6 describes electromagnetic effects . in section 7",
    ", we collect the results of the previous sections and give a complete treatment of the phenomenology of equivalence principle violations , including comparisons with existing experiments .",
    "section 8 provides a guide to experimental sensitivities for existing and future experiments .",
    "experimenters who are willing to forgo the theoretical development of section 3 - 6 can go directly to section 7 - 8 or can consult our shorter paper @xcite in which we have collected our most phenomenologically useful results . in particular , section 7.3 contains what is probably the most useful parameterization of our results and section 7.4 discusses the present experimental constraints .",
    "section 9 is a brief summary .",
    "let us start by recalling that a massless dilaton @xmath2 modifies the newtonian interaction between a mass @xmath11 and a mass @xmath12 , into the form ( see , e.g. @xcite ) @xmath13 if the dilaton mass is important the second term includes an extra exponential factor @xmath14 . in this interaction potential , the scalar coupling to matter",
    "is measured by the dimensionless factor @xmath15 } { \\partial \\phi } .\\ ] ] here , @xmath16 is the inverse of the planck mass . ] so that the product @xmath17 is dimensionless .",
    "this ensures that this definition of @xmath18 is valid in any choice of units , even if these units are such that @xmath19 depends on @xmath2 ( as in the so - called ` string frame ' ) . in the following",
    ", we shall generally assume that we work in the ` einstein frame ' where the ( bare ) newton constant @xmath20 is independent of @xmath2 .",
    "the above expression for the dimensionless scalar coupling @xmath18 has been written in terms of a canonically normalized scalar field , with kinetic term [ using the signature @xmath21 @xmath22 evidently , a small mass term for the dilaton can readily be added if desired .",
    "it can also be convenient to work with the _ dimensionless _ scalar field @xmath23 whose kinetic term is related to the einstein - hilbert action via @xmath24 when using @xmath25 the definition of the dimensionless scalar coupling reads @xmath26 } { \\partial \\varphi}.\\ ] ]    in terms of the @xmath27 s , the violation of the ( weak ) ep , i.e. the fractional difference between the accelerations of two bodies @xmath11 and @xmath12 falling in the gravitational field generated by an external body @xmath28 , reads @xmath29 in the last ( approximate ) equation we have assumed that the @xmath30 s are small , so that one can neglect the term @xmath31 in the denominator .",
    "our aim here is to provide a general analysis of the possible ep violations in experiments comparing the free fall accelerations of atoms ( and/or nuclei ) .",
    "most of the effort needed for such an analysis is now understood @xcite , and we will use it below . however , one aspect of this analysis has been far less well - studied and understood , namely the contribution to ep violation coming from the possible @xmath2-dependence of the _ nuclear binding energy_. the aim of this paper will mainly be to assess the form of this contribution , coming from the quark mass contribution to nuclear binding .",
    "actually , our conclusion will be that this contribution is , possibly in competition with coulomb - binding effects , likely to dominate the atom - dependence of the ep violation signal ( [ da / a ] ) .    to motivate our general analysis ,",
    "let us start by noting that the mass of an atom can be decomposed as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the rest - mass contribution to the mass of an atom ( @xmath34 denoting the atomic number and @xmath35 the number of neutrons ) , and where @xmath36 is the binding energy of the atom , which is dominated by the binding energy of the nucleus .",
    "@xmath37 is the sum of a strong interaction contribution , say @xmath38 , and of an electromagnetic one , say @xmath39 ( which is dominated by the electromagnetic effect within the nucleus ) .",
    "the indices @xmath40 and @xmath41 are used here as reminders of the gauge groups underlying the considered interactions : namely , @xmath42 and @xmath43 . note that the index @xmath11 in @xmath44 is used here ( like in the definition of the scalar coupling @xmath45 ) as a label for distinguishing several different atoms .",
    "it should not be confused with the mass number ( or nucleon number ) @xmath46 which we shall use below .",
    "the basic organizing principle that we shall use in our discussion is to keep track of the effect of all the possible @xmath2 modifications of the terms entering the effective action describing physics at the scale of nuclei in their ground states .",
    "we have in mind here an energy scale @xmath47 gev .",
    "at such a scale , one has integrated out not only the effect of weak interactions , but also the heavy quarks @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the issue of the possible @xmath2 sensitivity of effects linked to the strange quark @xmath50 is more delicate . in the appendix",
    "we argue that the possible ep violations linked to the @xmath2 couplings to @xmath50 are expected to be quite small . in the bulk of the text we shall therefore ignore @xmath50 ( assuming that its effect is taken into account by changing some of the quantities we discuss , notably the qcd energy scale @xmath51 ) .    in this approximation",
    ", we are therefore talking about an effective action containing , as real particles , the electron @xmath52 , the @xmath53 quark , and the @xmath54 quark , with interactions mediated by the electromagnetic ( @xmath55 ) and gluonic ( @xmath56 ) fields .",
    "[ here we shall use a rescaled @xmath43 gauge potential , which incorporates the electron charge @xmath52 , but an unrescaled gluonic field , which does not incorporate the @xmath42 gauge coupling @xmath57 . ] then each of the five terms in this effective action , say @xmath58 \\ ; , \\ ] ] ( where @xmath59 denotes the dirac operator coupled to the gauge field(s ) @xmath11 ) can couple to @xmath60 with a ( dimensionless ) coefficient .",
    "[ we assume that we work in the einstein frame , with the gravity and @xmath2 kinetic terms displayed above . ]",
    "this introduces _ five _ dimensionless dilaton coupling coefficients , say @xmath61 for the couplings to the electromagnetic and gluonic field terms , and @xmath62 for the couplings to the fermionic mass termsdependent coupling to the kinetic term of a fermion , @xmath63 , can be absorbed in a suitable @xmath64dependent rescaling of @xmath65 . ] .",
    "we shall normalize these five dimensionless dilaton coupling coefficients @xmath66 so that they correspond ( when considering the linear couplings to @xmath2 ) to the following interaction terms @xmath67\\ ] ] we shall explain below the notation and our choice of normalization for these interaction terms .",
    "there are two equivalent ways of thinking about the computation of the scalar - matter coupling @xmath45 , eq .",
    "( [ alphaphi ] ) .",
    "one way is to think that it is given by the matrix element ( in the quantum state of an atom ) of the operator in the quantum hamiltonian ( associated to the interaction lagrangian above ) which is linear in @xmath2 .",
    "a second way is to think that it is obtained by the chain rule as @xmath68 } { \\partial \\varphi } = \\sum_a \\frac{\\partial \\ln[\\kappa m_a(k_a ) ] } { \\partial k_a }   \\frac{\\partial k_a } { \\partial \\varphi } .\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is the expression of the dimensionless mass ratio @xmath70 as a function of the dimensionless coupling constants of nature , say @xmath71 , entering the standard model .",
    "actually , because of the limited number of terms entering the relevant low - energy action ( [ action ] ) , there are only five relevant dimensionless constants of nature @xmath72 corresponding to the five terms in ( [ action ] ) . as we shall see in detail below , the five terms in the interaction terms ( [ lint ] )",
    "precisely correspond to introducing a @xmath2 dependence in the five following dimensionless constants of nature , @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the fine - structure constant , @xmath51 the qcd energy scale , @xmath75 the electron ( pole ) mass , and where @xmath76 and @xmath77 denote some renormalization - group - invariant measures of the light quark masses ( say , the @xmath78-running masses taken at the multiple of @xmath51 which is equal to @xmath41 gev ) .    in the next section",
    "we shall relate our normalisation of the five dimensionless dilaton coupling parameters @xmath79 entering ( [ lint ] ) to the constants ( [ constants ] ) , and explain in more detail the dependence of the mass of an atom on the five constants ( [ constants ] ) , and thereby on the five dilaton parameters @xmath79 .",
    "by comparing the @xmath2-interaction lagrangian ( [ lint ] ) to the other terms in the effective action ( [ action ] ) , we see that the meaning of the dilaton coupling coefficients @xmath80 seems clear for four of them .",
    "[ actually , we shall see below that the meaning of the quark - mass couplings @xmath81 is more subtle , because of the renormalization group running of the quark masses , which is associated with the @xmath82 term in ( [ lint ] ) . ] first , the coupling @xmath83 to the electromagnetic field modifies the maxwell action according to @xmath84 where the last equality is valid at the linear level in @xmath85 ( which is the level at which we define the dilaton couplings here ) . as we work with a rescaled electromagnetic field ( @xmath86 ) ,",
    "the only location where the electric charge occurs in the lagrangian is the one explicitly shown above .",
    "this allows the dilaton field to be absorbed into the following @xmath2 dependence of the fine - structure constant @xmath87 second , comparing ( [ lint ] ) to the mass terms of the electron and the light quarks , we see that our normalization is such that @xmath62 introduce the following @xmath2 dependence of the @xmath88 and @xmath54 masses : @xmath89    on the other hand , the terms in ( [ lint ] ) that depend on our ` dilaton - gluon ' coupling @xmath90 call for a more subtle explanation .",
    "the choice of these coupling terms is such that the coefficient of @xmath90 is invariant under the renormalization - group ( rg ) .",
    "as the coefficient of @xmath81 ( i.e. the mass term @xmath91 ) is also , separately , rg - invariant , our choice of normalization of the coefficients in ( [ lint ] ) gives a rg - invariant meaning to both @xmath90 and the @xmath81 s .",
    ", and of the masses of fermions coupled to qcd . in view of the smallness of the electromagnetic coupling @xmath92 , we are neglecting the rg - running driven by electromagnetic effects .",
    "if one wanted to take it into account , one should add to ( [ lint ] ) additional terms linked to the qed trace anomaly . ]",
    "the phenomenological consequences ( for the scalar coupling to hadrons ) of the rg - invariant nature of the couplings in ( [ lint ] ) can be seen in two ( equivalent ) ways .",
    "one way ( which was used by @xcite and @xcite ) consists in remarking that the definition of the @xmath90-dependent terms in ( [ lint ] ) is such that they couple @xmath2 to the anomalous part of the trace of the gluon stress - energy tensor , namely @xmath93 where @xcite @xmath94_{\\mu}\\ ] ] here , @xmath95 denotes the @xmath96 function for the running of the qcd coupling @xmath57 with the ( wilsonian ) sliding energy scale @xmath78 , @xmath97 ( with a minus sign on the r.h.s . )",
    "is the ( universal ) anomalous dimension giving the energy - running of the masses of the qcd - coupled fermions , and the subscript @xmath78 at the end indicates that the operator on the r.h.s .",
    "must be renormalized at the running scale @xmath78 .",
    "we recall that , classically , the trace of the gluonic stress - energy tensor vanishes ( because of the conformal invariance of the yang - mills action ) , but that quantum effects linked to the necessity of regularizing the uv infinities in the product of gluon field strengths at the same spacetime point @xmath98 introduce the ( finite ) ` conformal anomaly ' ( [ tg ] ) @xcite .",
    "then , by using the quantum version of the virial theorem vanishes in an equilibrium bound state .",
    "] , one can see @xcite that the coupling ( [ lintg ] ) means that @xmath90 measures the coupling of @xmath2 to the part of the total mass - energy of the considered hadron which is due to the ( renormalized ) gluonic field energy , say @xmath99 ( where @xmath99 can be defined by subtracting from the total mass both the non - anomalous mass - term contributions @xmath100 , and the electromagnetic one ) .",
    "a second way of discussing the consequences ( for the scalar coupling to hadrons ) of our normalization of couplings in ( [ lint ] ) is phenomenologically illuminating .",
    "it consists in noting that our rg - invariant definitions are equivalent to very simple consequences for the @xmath2 dependences of both the qcd mass scale @xmath51 , and the values of the quark masses at the scale @xmath101 .",
    "[ note that both @xmath51 and @xmath102 are rg - invariantly defined quantities .",
    "] let us start by defining the qcd mass scale @xmath51 as being the mass scale at which the running qcd coupling @xmath103 reaches some fixed , reference dimensionless number of order unity , say @xmath104 .",
    "[ this numerical value , which corresponds to @xmath105 , is approximately reached when the running scale @xmath106 gev ( see , e.g. , the figure giving @xmath107 in the qcd review in @xcite ) . ]",
    "this definition of @xmath51 can be re - expressed in terms of the value @xmath108 of @xmath57 at some high - energy ` cut - off ' scale @xmath109 ( which could be the planck scale , or the string scale ) by integrating the @xmath96 equation giving the running of @xmath57 , @xmath110 , so that : @xmath111 the expression ( [ lambda3 ] ) defines @xmath51 as a function of @xmath109 and @xmath112 .",
    "if we assume for simplicity that the chosen cut - off @xmath109 does not depend ( in the einstein frame ) on @xmath2 , the result ( [ lambda3 ] ) shows that @xmath51 will inherit a @xmath2 dependence from any eventual @xmath2 dependence of @xmath112 according to ( denoting @xmath113 ) @xmath114 similarly , the integration of the rg equation for a running fermionic mass @xmath115 , namely @xmath116 yields the following expression for the value of @xmath115 at the qcd scale , @xmath117 : @xmath118 differentiating this result w.r.t .",

    "the @xmath2-dependent terms in ( [ lint ] ) to the basic action ( [ action ] ) ( both being considered at the cut - off scale @xmath109 ) , we see that the coefficients @xmath90 and @xmath81 have the effect of adding some @xmath2-dependence in the values of @xmath112 and @xmath122 of the form @xmath123 inserting these results in the @xmath25-derivatives of @xmath51 and @xmath102 derived above , finally leads ( thanks to the cancellation of the @xmath124-dependent contribution in the derivative of the masses ) to the simple results    @xmath125    summarizing : the physical meaning of the five dilaton - coupling coefficients @xmath80 is ( at the linear level in @xmath2 ) to introduce a @xmath2-dependence in the parameters entering the low - energy physics of the form @xmath126(\\varphi ) & =   & ( 1 + d_{m_i } \\varphi ) m_i(\\lambda_3 ) , \\ , i = u , d .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      note that a consequence of these equations is that the dimensionless ratios @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 depend on @xmath25 through the ratios @xmath130 . in other words ,",
    "the @xmath25 sensitivity of these dimensionless ratios is @xmath131}{\\partial \\varphi}= d_{m_i}- d_g \\ , .\\ ] ] note that this involves only the _ differences _ @xmath132 . in particular ,",
    "when the mass couplings @xmath81 are taken to be all equal to @xmath90 , the effect of the @xmath2 couplings is equivalent to introducing a @xmath2 dependence only in @xmath51 and @xmath30 .",
    "this fact can also be seen by means of the formulation ( [ lintg ] ) of the @xmath90 coupling . indeed , when @xmath133 the sum of ( [ lintg ] ) and of the mass - term couplings is equivalent to having a coupling between @xmath2 and the _ sum _ of the anomalous , @xmath134 , and of the non - anomalous , @xmath135 , parts of the trace of the total stress - energy tensor .",
    "therefore , modulo electromagnetic effects , this would imply that @xmath2 couples to the trace of the total stress - energy tensor , i.e. ( using the virial theorem ) that @xmath2 couples to the total mass of the hadron . in this particular case",
    ", the only violations of the ep would come from electromagnetic effects .",
    "however , in view of the fact that the physics which determines ( in the standard model ) the masses of the leptons and quarks involves the symmetry breaking of the electroweak sector , and , in particular , the vev of the higgs field , it does not seem a priori likely that a fundamental theory describing the high - energy couplings of the dilaton can ensure such a universal feature .",
    "from this point of view , one can consider our final results ( [ phidependence ] ) as useful general parametrizations of the low - energy dilaton couplings , independently of the complicated physics that might connect these parameters to an eventual high - energy description of the @xmath2 couplings to the fields entering the basic lagrangian .",
    "for example , heavy quarks do not enter the field couplings ( [ lint ] ) , but they enter in the relation between the qcd scale @xmath51 ( describing the physics at scales @xmath136 gev ) and the high - energy boundary conditions , @xmath137 .",
    "therefore , the parametrization of @xmath90 in ( [ phidependence ] ) implicitly takes into account the effect of heavy quarks .",
    "@xcite showed how to explicitly take into account the effect of heavy quarks , and it is easily checked that their results are in agreement with the first equation in ( [ phidependence ] ) . ]",

    "our proposal is intended as an update , or a specification , of previous similar proposals ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "actually , our proposal is two - headed .    on the one hand , if we make minimal assumptions , and essentially no approximations , we propose to parameterize ep violations by means of the matter coupling ( [ alpha5 ] ) , which involves five parameters . one of them , @xmath90 ( or more accurately @xmath462 ) measures the composition - independent part of the matter coupling , and can , in principle , be measured by composition - independent gravity tests .",

    "let us briefly indicate some consequences of our proposals .",
    "the first useful result in the simplified `` reference dilaton model '' is the expected ratio between composition - independent effects and composition - dependent ones .",
    "as explained above the former are essentially measured by the eddington parameter should more accurately be replaced by some average @xmath475 , with a coefficient @xmath476 depending of the average composition of the considered source bodies . ] @xmath477 while the latter are given , say , by eq .",
    "( [ epviolation ] ) .",
    "note that the numerical value @xmath478 in the latter equation comes from the @xmath479 charge difference between be and ti .",
    "we can use instead the maximal difference of @xmath480 corresponding to be and pt .",
    "this yields the approximate link @xmath481 note that , assuming @xmath482 , this differs by two orders of magnitude from the link @xmath483 estimated in @xcite from considering as dominant the em coupling @xmath83 instead of @xmath471 .",
    "this suggests that current ep tests correspond to post - newtonian tests at the level @xmath484 , i.e. six orders of magnitude below the current best post - newtonian test , namely the cassini limit eq .",
    "( [ cassini ] ) .",
    "[ using the results derived above from combining eotwash and llr data , one actually gets a constraint at the level @xmath485 , where the loss of a factor @xmath486 comes from the combination of effects explained above . ]      concerning the comparison among the sensitivities of different ep experiments , we already gave above an example of the use of our framework ( comparison between eotwash and llr ) .",
    "let us also mention another illustrative example .",
    "note that each ep comparison of a pair of materials , say @xmath487 , corresponds , within our simplified framework , to looking for a signal of the form @xmath488 , where @xmath489 is the two - dimensional vector of dilaton couplings @xmath490 , and @xmath491 a two - dimensional vector of dilaton - charge differences @xmath492 . for instance , the current best eotwash comparison concerned be and ti , i.e. ( using table 1 ) the ` charge ' vector @xmath493 .",
    "by contrast , the microscope experiment plans to use a pair ti , pt , which corresponds to the charge vector @xmath494 .",
    "we see that the two choices are nicely complementary in that the former ( using lighter elements ) gives more weight to the @xmath148 component of the ep violation , while the latter ( with heavier elements ) gives approximately equal weights to the @xmath148 and @xmath52 directions .",
    "special mention should be given to the sensitivity of ep experiments based on atomic - interferometer techniques .",
    "for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite mentions the possibility of comparing two isotopes of rubidium : ( @xmath495rb,@xmath496rb ) .",
    "in such a case , we wish to warn the reader that one should not blindly use the formulas that we have derived above , especially the approximate ones for @xmath497 .",
    "indeed , the approximations used to simplify the charges employed the average link ( [ z ] ) between @xmath34 and @xmath11 .",
    "this approximation is acceptable if one compares elements that are distant along the periodic table , but is definitely invalid for isotopes of the same @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , one should start from our original , non - approximated expressions for the charges .",
    "the use of our ( ` exact ' ) dilaton charges , suggests that an ep test comparing ( @xmath495rb,@xmath496rb ) would correspond , in the full four - dimensional space of @xmath498 , to a charge vector equal to @xmath499 .",
    "note that the components of this vector are significantly smaller than those of the charge vectors probed by the other experiments .",
    "the dominant direction is along @xmath52 .",
    "note also that the @xmath149 direction now plays a role as significant as the @xmath148 one , because , besides the binding energies , a crucial effect in comparing two isotopes is evidently a change in the number of neutrons .",
    "this also shows that such experiments are complementary to the usual ones , in that they probe new directions in theory space , though it comes at the cost of the overall sensitivity .",
    "the atomic interferometer proposal of @xcite suggests the comparison of @xmath500li and @xmath501cs atoms .",
    "in contrast to the rubidium experiment , these elements are well separated in @xmath502 , and our simplified charges can be used .",
    "we find that this comparison is quite sensitive to the dilaton couplings with dilaton charge vector @xmath503 .",
    "while the experimental comparison of dissimilar atoms may be more difficult than the use of related isotopes , the sensitivity to the dilaton couplings is much increased .",
    "let us also make some further comments relevant for comparing two isotopes which are very close in mass .",
    "our derivation assumed that the semi - empirical mass formula was an accurate representation of the binding energies .",
    "however , this mass formula is an average , which does not always accurately capture local fluctuations , and notably fluctuations linked to varying @xmath11 for a fixed @xmath34 .",
    "in addition , our derivation has neglected the pairing term @xmath504 , as being subdominant . however",

    "odd _ integer . indeed , in that case @xmath174 $ ] _ changes by one unit _ between the two isotopes , and therefore yields a full contribution @xmath189 to their mass difference , and thereby also to the dilaton sensitivity .",
    "actually , we would suggest to try to take advantage of this fact by using such odd - related isotopes which are likely to have an enhanced sensitivity to ep violations .",
    "[ we are aware , however , that this proposal poses both theoretical challenges ( determining the @xmath25 sensitivity of @xmath189 ) , and experimental ones ( as the two isotopes will have a different fermi / bose statistics , which might undermine the possibility of using accurate , bose - einstein - condensation - based , techniques ) . ]",
    "let us also mention that our framework can be straightforwardly applied to comparing ( weak ) equivalence principle tests to atomic - clock tests of the dependence of coupling constants on the gravitational potential .",
    "the link between these two types of tests has been discussed by several authors @xcite .",
    "let us indicate how it is formulated in our notation .",
    "the spacetime dependence of the dilaton field is approximately of the form : @xmath505 , where @xmath506 is the cosmological value of @xmath25 , and where @xmath507 gives the influence of the local matter distribution , in terms of the local gravitational potential @xmath508 ( @xmath509 ) . in the second expression , we have used the approximation @xmath510 . combining this result with our parametrization @xmath511 of the @xmath25 dependence of the various constants",
    "@xmath512 , we see that the local gravitational potential influences the values of the constants @xmath72 measured , say , on the earth , according to @xmath513 where the coefficients @xmath514 , i.e. @xmath515 are the _ same _ dilaton coefficients that entered our discussion above of the ep tests .",
    "then , to compute the effect of the seasonally varying @xmath508 on , say , the frequencies of atomic clocks , one needs to know the sensitivity of these frequencies to variations in the @xmath72 s ( see @xcite ) . in particular , the @xmath516 two - sigma bound derived above on @xmath517 , combined with the yearly variation @xmath518 linked with the earth s eccentricity , shows that ep tests constrain the yearly variation of the fine - structure constant on the earth to be smaller than @xmath519 ( two sigma ) .",
    "this is about @xmath427 times smaller than the current best atomic - clock experimental sensitivity to the variation of @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "note , however , that clock - comparison experiments are sensitive to different combinations of the parameters @xmath520 than ep tests @xcite",
    ". we shall not discuss here the cosmological aspects of the variation of constants , which are more model - dependent .",
    "for instance , in the context of the dilaton - runaway model , one can relate the present rate of variation of the ` constants ' to the ( square root of the ) ep violation level , see eq .",
    "( 3.25 ) of @xcite .",
    "let us finally remark that it would be interesting to use the recent progress ( reported in @xcite and here ) about the quark - mass dependence of nuclear binding to try to derive a well - justified estimate of the quark - mass dependence of the crucial very low - energy neutron capture resonance @xmath521 ev @xmath522 mev of @xmath523sm .",
    "indeed , the analysis of the oklo data @xcite shows that this resonance has not changed by more than about @xmath524 ev since the oklo natural fission reactor was in activity 2 billion years ago .",
    "a naive use of our results , based on our finding that the bulk binding energy per nucleon , @xmath185 , varies with @xmath525 as @xmath526 mev , suggests that oklo data constrain the fractional variation of @xmath527 over 2 billion years to the level @xmath528 .",
    "such a limit would be a very significant constraint on the possible cosmological evolution of the dilaton .",
    "however , it is not clear whether a detailed study of the specific ( unstable ) energy level corresponding to @xmath529 will confirm this sensitivity to @xmath527 .",
    "we have provided a parametrized framework for the study of the equivalence principle in models with light , dilaton - like scalar particles .",

    "the most novel aspect of our work was to provide an estimate of the effects of the dilaton coupling to nuclear binding energy .",
    "we have found that these couplings induce , as leading effect , equivalence principle violations varying with the mass number as @xmath0 .",
    "the level of these ep violations is expected to be at least comparable to ( and , for lighter elements , somewhat larger than ) that associated to the coulomb energy .",

    "for example , the much debated contribution of the strange quark to the mass of neutrons and protons @xcite would not lead to the violation of the equivalence principle .",

    "note that the large effects suggested for strange contributions to nucleon masses recently have been bounded by lattice computations to be consistent with zero @xcite . in nuclear binding , the leading @xmath11 dependent term does not violate the equivalence principle , and it is only the surface term that is relevant . therefore the key feature to be estimated is the strange quark contribution to the surface binding energy .    in discussing the binding energy",
    "it is easy to be led astray .",
    "for example early estimates used kaon loops in chiral perturbation theory to conclude that there was a very large effect @xcite .",

    "the coupling of the @xmath25 to nucleons is highly uncertain , and depends more on the assumptions made in a given calculation than in a unique piece of evidence in its favor .",
    "moreover it is highly constrained by recent experiments @xcite that show smaller than expected hidden strange couplings in nucleons .",
    "if we use a estimate which we find to be reasonable and which is within the constraints of present experiments @xcite , the @xmath25 effects are too small to be significant .",
    "however , @xmath534 intermediate states can contribute to the leading scalar interaction and may have a non - trivial effect .",
    "we expect from most models of the nuclear potential that most of the scalar strength comes from below 1 gev .",
    "the effect of @xmath536 intermediate states must decouple as the mass of the meson @xmath537 gets large .",
    "if we estimate generously that @xmath534 intermediate states contributes @xmath538 to the scalar strength , and we take a typical form factor to account for the high mass threshold of the form @xmath539 ( where @xmath540 is is some typical form factor scale ) , we would estimate the strange quark mass dependence @xmath541 using @xmath542 .",
