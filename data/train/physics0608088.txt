    "in recent years , the investigation of quantum gases in low  dimensional trapping geometries has significantly attracted the attention of the physics research community .",
    "this growing interest is motivated , partially , by the current possibilities that the extremely rapid progress in integrated atom optics has opened for the manipulation of bose ",

    "this development allows the study of crucial problems associated with the strong modifications that the fundamental properties of these quantum systems experience due to the reduced dimensionality .",

    "current ( dc ) magnetic trap , the phase defects of a bec were investigated in a quasi2d trap based on a 1d optical lattice  @xcite and , in atom chip experiments , dc current  carrying wires are usually employed to confine atoms in highly anisotropic traps  @xcite . although these trapping configurations have demonstrated their relevance for studying quantum gases in low dimensions , adiabatic potentials  @xcite , resulting from a combination of dc and radio  frequency ( rf ) magnetic fields , are also becoming a very attractive and promising tool  @xcite .",
    "the rf traps share the versatility and flexibility of the above mentioned trapping schemes and , moreover , they are relatively easy to implement and control . in the first implementation of these traps",

    "a rf adiabatic potential has also been used as a beam splitter , allowing the demonstration of matter  wave interference on an atom chip  @xcite .",

    "einstein condensed atoms , preserving the quantum degeneracy , can be a challenging task .",
    "in this situation , it is of relevance to consider the possibility of evaporative cooling of atoms _ directly _ in these low  dimensional rf traps .",
    "this is the subject that will be addressed in this paper , taking into account the interaction of the atoms with two radio  frequency fields .",
    "when dealing with more than one rf frequency , an analytical solution for the atomic spin dynamics can be found by treating the individual successive interactions of the rf fields with the atoms  @xcite or by considering the two fields simultaneously , provided one of the fields is rather weak  @xcite .",

    "[ sec : magnus ] ) and , secondly , by using the second rwa ( sec .",
    "[ sec:2rwa ] ) .",
    "they have also been interpreted with the vector picture in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] as rotations about @xmath134 .",
    "hence we can see that if at a given time instant @xmath54 the precession axis of @xmath50 has zero projection onto @xmath30 , then this state vector will be orthogonal to the initial dressed rf state and consequently , a transition has taken place .",
    "clearly , the second rf field can transfer hot atoms out of the initial trapped dressed state .",
    "the pulse has to be repeated several times during the trap oscillation period to ensure an efficient evaporation of all the atoms with sufficient energy to reach the resonances .",
    "the pulsed evaporative cooling scheme requires that we can discriminate between hot and cold atoms by affecting as little as possible the atoms in the region of the rf trap centre .",
    "this implies a careful choice of the pulse duration and amplitude as will be discussed below .",
    "we already noted that in some situations it may not be desirable to evaporate via the inner resonance ( sec .",
    "[ sec : genevap ] ) .",
    "one way we can avoid this resonance in the pulsed scheme is to carefully chose the time duration of the pulse .",
    "for example , we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](f ) that the depletion at the inner resonance ( ir ) takes place later compared to the outer resonance ( or ) .",
    "this happens because , independently of the orientation of the dc magnetic field , the coupling with the rabi frequency @xmath23 in ( [ eq : tah ] ) is spatially inhomogeneous since @xmath24 depends on @xmath69 . to investigate this inhomogeneity for different values of @xmath52 ,",
    "we have chosen in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] a particular value @xmath102 and explore the ratio of the probability of being in the untrapped states at the two resonances .",
    "this is shown in the figure as a function of the frequency difference @xmath52 .",
    "the second rwa can predict this relative effectiveness of the inner and outer resonances . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : tah ] ) this ratio can be determined analytically for @xmath90 and it is plotted in fig .  [ fig:8 ] with a solid line .",
    "the calculation of the numerical results in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] is done as follows . for a given value of @xmath52 a figure similar to fig .",
    "[ fig:5](d ) is plotted .",
    "then , the ratio of the inner peak height to the outer peak height is found .",
    "this is the coupling strength ratio we are interested in . since there is an excellent agreement between the exact solution and the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] , we can state that indeed the second rwa works well in the parameter range we have explored . notice that for @xmath135 we recover the expected result that only the resonant coupling at the frequency @xmath1 will occur between the bare states .",
    "for intermediate values of @xmath52 , we can clearly see that the particular choice @xmath102 for the pulse duration allows a good discrimination between the resonances ir and or . in the final evaporation stage , where @xmath136 , if we wish to limit the ir excitation it is necessary to adapt the pulse duration .",
    "as mentioned above we should avoid introducing transitions at the dressed rf trap centre . because of such transitions we can see in figs .",
    "[ fig:3](a ) , ( b ) , ( e ) and ( f ) that , even when the detuning for coupling adiabatic states is red or blue ( @xmath63 or @xmath64 ) , the population of the initial trapped dressed state @xmath99 is in fact modulated at the centre of the rf trap ( avoided level crossing ) .",
    "such a modulation can produce unwanted heating or losses and , to study this process , we introduce the modulation depth .",
    "this quantity is defined as the contrast of the oscillations presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:4](a ) as the black points ( numerical result ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] we plot the modulation depth as a function of the rabi frequency of the evaporation rf field , and for two different values of @xmath52 .",
    "as expected , the modulation depth increases with @xmath23 since larger rf power is available for coupling the adiabatic states .",
    "also not very surprising , this modulation is more pronounced when @xmath52 is such that @xmath1 couples adiabatic states close to the position of the avoided level crossing .",
    "taking into account the result presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] , we devised a strategy which affects as little as possible the coldest atoms , while doing the evaporation .",
    "the idea is to ramp @xmath23 and @xmath52 _ simultaneously _ to preserve a fixed modulation depth at the rf trap centre  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] such a ramp is presented , where we have allowed for a 3% modulation level of the coldest atoms population . note that the reduction of @xmath23 has to be taken into account for the optimization of the pulse duration .",
    "in fact , since @xmath23 and @xmath52 can be controlled independently , we can make individual ramps for each one of these parameters and manipulate independently the position and strength of the evaporation resonances .",
    "taking into account that there is a finite modulation of the atomic population at the rf trap centre , even for @xmath52 very different from @xmath27 , we propose to use a limited number of rf pulses to cool down the sample .",
    "for example , a pulsed evaporative cooling scheme has been developed demonstrating the achievement of the collisional regime in a beam of neutral atoms  @xcite .",
    "however , this pulsed scheme uses pulses longer than the trap oscillation period unlike the scheme proposed here .      our second scheme for the evaporative cooling of atoms in the dressed rf trap uses the second rf field in a continuous rather than pulsed mode .",
    "this situation is closer to the normal case of the evaporation of atoms in a dc magnetic trap by a single rf field . here",
    ", we simply use the _ second _ rf field as a tool to control the dressed rf trap depth .",
    "this trap depth corresponds to the energy required to reach the resonances ( with respect to the dressed rf trap bottom ) as considered in sec .",
    "[ sec : genevap ] .    in the usual case of continuous rf evaporation",
    "it is useful to look at the system using dressed states .",
    "in our situation , the equivalent relevant basis is given by doubly ",

    "this frequency determines the doubly  dressed potential @xmath139 which we would like the atoms to follow for the evaporation to proceed .",

    "( during the usual evaporation process the `` lips '' are subsequently lowered by ramping the rf frequency and the same procedure can be carried out here with the second rf field . )    for this picture to be valid , we must have an adiabatic following of the vector @xmath118 as the atoms move about the trap . a general condition for this",
    "can be expressed as @xmath145 where @xmath112 is given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : thetad ] ) and the right  hand member of the inequality ( [ eq : adiacond ] ) is seen to be just the energy separation between the doubly  dressed levels . in practice",
    "this condition is rather easily satisfied for a singly dressed rf trap ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which is relevant for the bottom of the doubly  dressed trap as illustrated in fig .  [ fig:11 ] . however , in order to also satisfy the adiabatic following condition ( [ eq : adiacond ] ) at the resonances , we will find a new constraint that @xmath23 should not be _ too _ small .",

    "( [ eq : adiacond ] ) implies that @xmath147 . to proceed",

    "adiabatic crossing to reach about @xmath154 for the outer resonance or .",
    "it is clear that if we switch from the outer resonance or ( at @xmath155 ) to the inner resonance ir ( at @xmath95 ) the adiabaticity condition ( [ eq : lz ] ) will be different .",
    "this is connected to both the spatially dependent coupling @xmath156/2 $ ] , and the effect of gravity , which as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:11 ] make the ir `` lip '' higher .",
    "the weaker coupling at the inner resonance also means that the dynamics is less adiabatic at this point .",
    "in fact for fairly `` hot '' atoms one can contrive that the resonance or is rather adiabatic whilst the resonance ir is rather diabatic .",
    "together with the effect of gravity , this would mean that atoms can be evaporated out of the or resonance whilst adiabatic coupling through the ir resonance is prevented .",
    "as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : genevap ] this can be useful to partially prevent the return of evaporated atoms to the resonance regions with subsequent collisions and heating .",
    "however , we note that if we want to reduce the final temperature by steadily reducing @xmath52 , the couplings at the two resonances become more equal ( as in the pulsed scheme ) and less discrimination between the two evaporation zones is possible .",
    "we have seen that we can employ a doubly  dressed basis  @xcite for the analysis of a dressed rf trap with two rf fields provided the second rf field is sufficiently weak . using this arrangement of fields",
    "we can create a scheme for the evaporative cooling of atoms in a singly dressed rf trap in a continuous mode .",
    "in contrast with the traditional continuous forced evaporation scheme the idea of evaporative cooling based on the application of rf pulses with properly chosen durations and frequencies is also developed for a dressed rf trap .",
    "the duration of such pulses is essentially determined by the power of the rf field used for the evaporation , although the optimal pulse length changes from one location to another in the adiabatic trapping potential . when the trapping and evaporative cooling radio  frequencies are comparable , we found the evaporation to happen _",
    "also _ via additional resonances",
    ". even if these resonances can enhance the evaporation process in both the pulsed and continuous schemes , we have to be careful that atoms evaporated through these resonances do not come back and heat the cold atomic cloud . in this respect ,",
    "the advantage of the pulsed scheme is to provide an additional control of the transition probability at the inner resonance via the pulse duration .",
    "however , the effect of gravity is to favour the evaporation via the outer resonance or which is then located at a position of lower energy . although the importance of this effect may depend on the particular trapping geometry ( pancake , ring traps ) , the evaporation schemes proposed in this paper are quite general and should allow an efficient cooling of atoms directly in the various rf traps which have been proposed or realized  @xcite .",
    "the main application of the work in this paper is to the evaporative cooling of atoms in a dressed trap .",
    "however , there are also applications concerning noise and stability of dressed rf traps where the carrier frequency @xmath0 is not perfectly monochromatic .",
    "this can be due , for instance , to contamination by stray fields .",
    "then it is clear that if the frequency components next to the carrier are in the range of , let s say , @xmath157 ",
    "@xmath158 , they will empty the rf trap if they have enough power to do so or , in the best case , they will raise the temperature of the atoms .",
