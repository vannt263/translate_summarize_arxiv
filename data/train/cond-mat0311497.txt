    "the first observation of coherent transport in a mesoscopic system@xcite opened up the field of electron interferometry in solids . following the development of the aharonov - bohm ( ab)-type interferometer , there appeared various types of electron interferometers including the fabry - prot type  @xcite and the mach - zehnder type  @xcite .",
    "such interferometry is of particular interest when the propagating electron experiences electronic states in a quantum dot ( qd ) , because the interference pattern provides information on the physical properties of the qd , for example , the electron correlation inside it .",
    "several interferometry experiments have been reported for a qd embedded in an ab ring  @xcite .    in these experiments",
    "one should remember that the unitarity of electron wave propagation inevitably affects the transport property of the system . in the case of two - terminal devices , for example , this results in the phase jump of ab oscillation at the resonance  @xcite .",
    "while the resonance has such a subtle aspect , it brings interesting effects on the transport when it is positively used .",
    "a representative is the fano effect  @xcite , which appears as a result of interference between the localized state and the continuum .",
    "although the fano effect has been established in spectroscopy  @xcite , its general importance in mesoscopic transport has been recognized only recently  @xcite .",
    "it has been predicted that the fano effect appears in a qd embedded in an ab ring as schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fanoschematic ]  ( a )  @xcite , and recently , we have reported on its first experimental observation  @xcite .",
    "the ab geometry has an advantage such that the interference pattern can be tuned by the magnetic flux piercing the ring , while its spatial size tends to be large . in order to maintain the quantum coherence and to observe clearer effects",
    ", a smaller scale interferometer would be desirable .",
    "a candidate is the quantum wire ( qw ) with a finite length .",
    "a qd plus a connecting qw with measurement leads can be realized in the system schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fanoschematic ]  ( b ) .",
    "here , the very short qw connecting the qd and the lead works as a resonator .",
    "we call this geometry a `` side - coupled '' qd or a `` t - coupled '' qd .",
    "the fano effect is expected to occur in the t - coupled qd in a way different from that in the qd - ab - ring system , because only reflected electrons at the qd are involved for its emergence . in the fano effect in the qd - ab - ring system reported previously  @xcite , the transmission through the qd played a central role as manifested in the amplitude of the ab oscillation that was in the same order of the coulomb peak height .",
    "thus , two types of fano effect can be defined as `` reflection mode '' and as `` transmission mode '' . in general , both modes coherently exist in the qd - ab - ring system ( a typical example will be discussed below in sec .",
    "[ subsec2 ] . ) . on the other hand ,",
    "only the reflection mode features in the t - coupled qd .",
    "while the fano effect in the reflection mode has been discussed theoretically  @xcite , the experimental realization has been lacking .",
    "furthermore , although the reflection amplitude itself conveys rich information on the qd , it has not fully been investigated since the pioneering experiment by buks _ et al _",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we report on the first experimental observation of the fano effect in a t - coupled qd . after describing the experimental setup in sec .",
    "[ secexp ] , evidence for the emergence of the fano state with decreasing temperature is given in sec .",
    "[ subsec1 ] .",
    "we discuss the temperature dependence of the coherence measured in this geometry in sec .",
    "[ sectdep ] . then in sec .",
    "[ subsec2 ] , we show that the fano effect in a t - coupled qd can be used to detect the phase shift in the scattering by the qd , which makes it a unique tool for investigating the phase and coherence of electrons in a qd .",
    "to realize a t - coupled qd , we fabricated the device shown in the scanning electron photomicrograph of fig .",
    "[ samplefig ] .",
    "it was fabricated from an algaas / gaas heterostructure by wetetching .",
    "the characteristics of the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) were as follows : mobility @xmath0  @xmath1vs , sheet carrier density @xmath2  @xmath3 , and electron mean free path @xmath4  @xmath5 m .",
    "this device is similar to what we had previously studied  @xcite .",
    "two sets of three fingers are au / ti metallic gates for controlling the local electrostatic potential .",
    "the three gates ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 ) on the lower arm are used for defining and controlling the parameters of the qd with a geometrical area of 0.2@xmath90.2  @xmath5m@xmath10 .",
    "the gate on the upper arm @xmath11 is used for tuning the conductance of this arm .    ,",
    "@xmath7 , and @xmath8 are applied as indicated in the figure ) on the lower arm are used for controlling the qd , and the gate voltage @xmath11 is used for tuning the conductance of the upper arm . when the gate @xmath6 is biased strongly , the system becomes a t - coupled qd , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fanoschematic ] ( b ) .",
    "the length of the qw , namely , the distance between the qd and the junction at the lead , is approximately @xmath12 m . ]    in the addition spectrum of the qd , the discrete energy levels inside the qd are separated by the level spacing due to the quantum confinement @xmath13 and the single - electron charging energy @xmath14",
    ". we can shift the spectrum using the center gate voltage @xmath7 to tune any one of them to the fermi level . in the present sample , by measuring the conductance through the qd , we found that @xmath13 and @xmath14 are typically @xmath15  @xmath5ev and @xmath16  mev , respectively .",
    "we can make the device a t - coupled qd by applying a large negative voltage on @xmath6 so that the electron transmission underneath @xmath6 is forbidden .",
    "this is topologically the same as the t - coupled qd shown in fig .",
    "[ fanoschematic ]  ( b ) .",
    "the distance between the qd and the junction at the lead is @xmath12 m .",
    "when required , we made this gate slightly transmissible in order to measure the ab signal through the system with the magnetic field ( @xmath17 ) applied perpendicular to the 2deg .",
    "measurements were performed in a mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator between 30  mk and 1  k by a standard lock - in technique in the two - terminal setup with an excitation voltage of 10  @xmath5v ( 80  hz , 5  fw ) between the source and the drain .",
    "noise filters were inserted into every lead below @xmath18  k as well as at room temperature .",
    "we set @xmath6 to @xmath19  v so as to forbid the electron transmission under it .",
    "@xmath8 was @xmath20  v , which made this gate slightly transmissible .",
    "@xmath11 was adjusted to make the conductance of the system around @xmath21 , which is a quasi - single channel condition .",
    "figure [ typicaldata ]  ( a ) shows typical results of the conductance through the system as a function of the gate voltage @xmath7 at several temperatures ( @xmath22 ) . since the connecting qw between the lead qw and the qd is narrow and long , the qd would not affect the conduction through the lead qw in the classical transport regime .",
    "correspondingly , at high temperatures above @xmath23  mk , hardly any characteristic structure appears in the signal .",
    "sharp dip structures , however , rapidly grow with decreasing temperature .",
    "they are antiresonance ( or reflection due to resonance ) dips due to coulomb oscillation in the qd .",
    "furthermore , the resonant features are very asymmetric and vary widely in their line shape . for example , at @xmath24  v and @xmath25  v , the line shape consists of a sharp dip and an adjacent peak , while only asymmetric sharp - dip structures appear between @xmath26  v and @xmath27  v.     at several temperatures",
    ". as the temperature was lowered , the fano feature appeared .",
    "the magnetic field was 0.80  t. the curves for @xmath28  mk are incrementally shifted upward for clarity .",
    "( b ) three fano features in the conductance at 30  mk are fitted to eq .  .",
    "the obtained @xmath29 s are shown .",
    "the vertical dashed lines indicate the obtained discrete level position @xmath30 s . ]",
    "these line shapes in the conductance are characteristic of the fano effect .",
    "in fact , the line shape at the lowest temperature can be fitted to  @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the noninterfering contribution of the lead and is a smooth function of @xmath7 that can be treated as a constant for each peak .",
    "the first term is the fano contribution with an real asymmetric parameter @xmath29 where the normalized energy @xmath33 the parameters @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 represent the amplitude , the position , and the width of the fano resonance , respectively .",
    "@xmath37 is the proportionality factor which relates @xmath7 to the electrochemical potential of the qd and is given by @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the capacitance between the qd and the gate @xmath7 , and @xmath40 is the total capacitance .",
    "note that the functional form of the fano part in eq .   can be applied to both resonance and antiresonance .",
    "the parameters of the qd can be obtained from an independent measurement of the transport through the qd under an appropriate condition of the gate voltages ( applying a large negative @xmath11 to cut the upper conduction path and opening the lower path by decreasing @xmath6 ) .",
    "we estimate @xmath41  @xmath5ev@xmath42mv for the present system .    figure  [ typicaldata ]  ( b ) shows typical results of the fitting for three dips .",
    "the satisfactory agreement assures that the fano state is formed in the t - coupled qd system .",
    "the obtained values of @xmath36 are @xmath43  @xmath5ev , which is much larger than the thermal broadening @xmath44  @xmath5ev at 30  mk ( here , @xmath45 is the boltzmann constant ) . in fig .",
    "[ typicaldata ]  ( b ) , the obtained @xmath29 s are also shown and the vertical dashed lines indicate the discrete level position ( @xmath30 ) . both the variation of @xmath29 and that of the level spacing indicate that the conductance through this system reflects the characteristic of each of the single levels in the qd .    the data in fig .",
    "[ typicaldata ]  ( a ) is obtained at @xmath46  t. the fano effect in this system has been observed at several magnetic fields , as was also the case in the fano effect in the qd - ab - ring system  @xcite . in the present case ,",
    "the role of the magnetic field can be understood because the qw between the qd and the junction is curved as shown in fig .",
    "[ samplefig ] , and the coupling is modified by the lorentz force . in the previous reports  @xcite , we have discussed that @xmath29 should be a complex number in a qd - ab - ring geometry under finite @xmath17 .",
    "this treatment is required to describe the @xmath7-@xmath17 dependence of the line shape to cover the wide range of @xmath17 , when the interfering phase is modulated by @xmath17 . for a fixed magnetic field , eq .   with a real @xmath29",
    "well describes the line shape .",
    "furthermore in the present case , since the effective area of the connecting qw is very small , the line shape is found to be much less sensitive to the magnetic field than the case of an ab ring .    in the t - coupled geometry",
    ", the resonance is detected through the nonlocal conductance and the electric field of the modulation gate @xmath7 works only locally , and therefore it is easy to distinguish the coherent part from the incoherent part in the conductance . in contrast , the transmission experiments such as in the qd - ab - ring system usually provide the transmission probability including both the coherent and incoherent processes  @xcite .",
    "for example , in the case of the fano resonance in the ab geometry , ordinary coulomb oscillation overlaps the coherent line shape . in the case of simple ab magnetoresistance",
    ", the magnetic field is applied all over the specimen , and the ab oscillation is superposed on the background conductance fluctuation .      with increasing temperature ,",
    "the dip structures are rapidly smeared out .",
    "the origins of such smearing due to finite temperature can be classified into thermal broadening and quantum decoherence .",
    "the former should be considered when @xmath47 becomes the same order of magnitude as @xmath48 at @xmath49  mk . henceforth , we focus on the thermal broadening and examine whether it alone can explain the observed diminishment of the resonance structure .",
    "the thermal broadening appears in the distribution in @xmath50 in the fano form in eq .  .",
    "as noted in the previous paper  @xcite , eq .",
    "is derived by assuming a point interaction between the localized states and the continuum . however in the present system , the length of the connecting qw is finite and dephasing during the traversal due to thermal broadening may be important .",
    "if such dephasing can be ignored , @xmath29 can be treated as a real number as noted above .",
    "conversely , the dephasing inside the connecting qw requires the use of complex @xmath29 s  @xcite .    in order to treat the thermal broadening quantitatively , we model a simple quantum circuit for the present system as shown in fig .",
    "[ fanotdepfitfig ] ( a ) .",
    "the qd is simply expressed as a tunable resonator consisting of a tunnel barrier and a perfect reflector .",
    "the phase shift of the reflector is approximated to be proportional to the gate voltage around the resonance .",
    "the connecting qw between the qd and the t - junction is simply a phase shifter of @xmath51 ( @xmath52 : wave vector ) .",
    "we put the s - matrix for the junction @xmath53 as @xmath54 to maintain the unitarity  @xcite . @xmath55 and @xmath56 are amplitudes of incoming and outgoing waves , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fanotdepfitfig ] ( a ) . here ,",
    "we take @xmath57 as a real number , which determines the direct reflection coefficient at the junction .",
    "the s - matrix for the qw ( phase shifter ) is expressed as @xmath58 the s - matrix for the tunnel barrier can then be written as @xmath59",
    "lastly , the reflector with a variable phase shift of @xmath60 is simply expressed as @xmath61     ( b ) .",
    "( b ) experimental data ( open circles ) and the fitted curves . the data for @xmath62  mk are incrementally shifted upwards for clarity .",
    "( c ) obtained @xmath34 value is shown in logarithmic scale as a function of temperature .",
    "the solid line shows the exponential decay @xmath63 with @xmath64  k@xmath65 . ]    by calculating the combined s - matrix , the complex transmission coefficient of the system is obtained as @xmath66 where @xmath67 since @xmath68 with @xmath69 ( @xmath70 : effective mass of electron ) . here , @xmath5 is the position of the chemical potential and @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath72 , @xmath73 , and the fermi velocity @xmath74 are estimated from the experimental conditions .",
    "the resonance of the qd occurs at @xmath75 , hence @xmath60 is taken as @xmath76 , where @xmath77 as in eq .  .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath78 numerically reproduces the first term of eq .   near the resonance .",
    "the conductance of the system at the low bias ( @xmath79 ) can be expressed by the landauer - bttiker formula as  @xcite @xmath80 we treat @xmath57 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath30 , and @xmath32 as fitting parameters . while @xmath30 and @xmath32 are slightly dependent on temperature due to the neighboring fano resonances , @xmath57 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 are treated as temperature - independent .",
    "@xmath34 is left temperature - dependent to absorb decoherence other than thermal broadening .",
    "we found that the fitting is insensitive to the value of @xmath57 as long as it is smaller than @xmath83 , which suggests that the specific form of @xmath53 in eq .",
    "does not affect the generality .",
    "figure  [ fanotdepfitfig ] ( b ) shows the results of the successful fitting for @xmath84 .",
    "note that the number of crucial fitting parameters is very small since most of the parameters can be uniquely determined at the lowest temperature and taken as temperature - independent .",
    "amplitude @xmath34 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fanotdepfitfig ] ( c ) as a function of temperature .",
    "at 600  mk , the amplitude @xmath34 still remains @xmath85  % of that at the lowest temperature .",
    "the observed strong temperature dependence , therefore , is mostly due to the thermal broadening in the qw . if we set @xmath72 to zero , the temperature dependence of eq .",
    "would be much weakened .",
    "interestingly , the behavior of @xmath34 is well fitted to @xmath63 with @xmath64  k@xmath65 between 30  mk and 500  mk .",
    "such temperature dependence of the coherence is reminiscent of that in an ab ring with the local and nonlocal configurations  @xcite , where the temperature dependence of the ab amplitude was found to be weaker in the nonlocal setup than in the local setup .",
    "theoretically it was pointed out that the difference in the impedance of the probes seen from the sample is important  @xcite . in the present case , since one end of the qd is cut and the nonlocal effect is observed , the impedance seen from the sample ( namely , the qd and the qw connecting it to the lead ) is very high and the situation is basically the nonlocal one they treated . hence , the discussion in ref .",
    "[ ] might be applicable here .",
    "in the present case , however , we do not have the data that corresponds to the `` local '' setup , which can be compared with the present ones .",
    "next , we discuss the application of the present geometry to the measurement of the phase evolution at the qd . while the qd - ab - ring geometry has been used for this purpose  @xcite , the t - coupled qd should also provide information on the phase shift by the qd . since in eq .",
    ", the dip structure is mainly due to the resonance and phase shift in the qd , we can , in principle , extract information on the phase shift .",
    "if we restrict ourselves around the resonance point , we can utilize the simple fano formula [ eq .",
    "] , instead of the complicated analysis by using the quantum circuit in the previous section . to observe this",
    ", we made the gate @xmath6 slightly open and allowed electrons to pass through the qd .",
    "the system is now a qd - ab - ring system rather than a t - coupled qd and the fano effect in both the reflection mode and the transmission mode is expected to occur .",
    "figure  [ tfanoab ]  ( a ) shows the conductance of the system as a function of @xmath7 , where two resonance dips showing fano line shape are plotted .",
    "the dashed lines indicate the positions of the discrete energy levels in the qd that are obtained by the aforementioned fitting procedure .",
    "the values of the asymmetric parameter @xmath29 are given in the figure .",
    "note that the direction of the asymmetric tail , namely , the sign of @xmath29 , is the same for both dips .     at 30  mk at @xmath86  t.",
    "the system now allows electrons to pass through the qd .",
    "the vertical lines indicate the positions of the discrete energy levels in the qd .",
    "note that the @xmath29 values are positive .",
    "( b ) gray - scale plots of the ab oscillation component of the system as a function of @xmath7 and @xmath17 . ( c ) phase of the ab oscillation obtained at each @xmath7 . ]",
    "because the conduction through the lower arm is maintained very low , these fano features change minimally with the slight variation of @xmath17 , although there exists a coherent component in the transmission through the qd , which appears as a small oscillation in conductance versus @xmath17 .",
    "this is the ab oscillation whose period is 2.0  mt as expected from the ring size .",
    "the ab oscillation was measured at each @xmath7 and the ab component was extracted by fast fourier transformation ( fft ) .",
    "figure  [ tfanoab ]  ( b ) shows the obtained ab component in the gray - scale plot as a function of @xmath7 and @xmath17 . the coherent component through",
    "the qd is only of the order of @xmath87 , in clear contrast with the net signal up to the order of @xmath88 [ fig .",
    "[ tfanoab ]  ( a ) ] .",
    "this ensures that the fano effect in the reflection mode still plays a central role due to the slight opening of the gate @xmath6 .",
    "contrastingly , in the previous experiment  @xcite both @xmath6 and @xmath8 were made appropriately transmissible , and the amplitude of the ab oscillation was in the same order of the net signal ( see fig .",
    "8 in ref .  ) , which is a sign of the fano effect in the transmission mode .",
    "now , we focus on the behavior of the phase of the ab oscillation .",
    "we traced the conductance maximum as a function of @xmath7 and plotted in fig .",
    "[ tfanoab ]  ( c ) in the unit of the ab period .",
    "the phase abruptly changes by @xmath89 just at the resonance points .",
    "such a phase jump that occurs in the energy scale much smaller than @xmath90 reflects the two - terminal nature of the present qd - ab - ring system .",
    "the ab oscillations at both dips are in - phase .",
    "this is consistent with the result of the previous report  @xcite .",
    "although the origin of the in - phase nature of the coulomb peak is still under debate despite of several theoretical studies  @xcite , it is clear that the sign of @xmath29 is the same for both dips reflecting the in - phase nature .",
    "this result , which is reproduced for other peaks in the present experiment , demonstrates that `` phase measurement '' can be performed simply by observing the sign of @xmath29 , without investigating the ab oscillation .",
    "interestingly , there also exists another slow @xmath89 phase shift away from the resonance point commonly for these peaks , leading to their in - phase nature .",
    "such behavior is consistent with that observed in the fano effect in the transmission mode  @xcite .",
    "we have realized the fano effect in a qw with a side - coupled qd .",
    "the temperature dependence of the resonance structure was analyzed by including the thermal broadening , which turned out to be mostly responsible for the rapid smearing of the resonances .",
    "we have shown that the phase measurement of electrons at a qd is also possible in this geometry and gives a result consistent with that by a qd - ab - ring system .",
    "while such a simple geometry as the t - coupled qd has never been investigated experimentally , its clear advantage lies in that only a coherent signal associated with the qd is obtained .",
    "this work proves that the fano effect in this interferometer can be a powerful tool for measuring the coherence and phase of electrons .",
