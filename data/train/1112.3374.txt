    "the lower solar atmosphere @xmath0 photosphere and chromosphere @xmath0 is usually treated using the approximation of magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) .",
    "different dynamical processes , like , e.g. , wave propagation , formation of magnetic structures , flux emergence , etc . , have been quite successfully described with this formalism . nevertheless ,",
    "because of the rather cool temperatures of the photosphere and low chromosphere , the degree of ionization there is very small , reaching values as low as @xmath1 in the temperature minimum , and remaining always well below unity even at larger heights ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this fact , together with the decrease of collisional coupling with height , leads to a break of the assumptions underlying mhd . in the upper photosphere and chromosphere",
    ", collisions are unable to couple completely the neutral and ionized components . due to that , several new effects appear , such as non - ideal hall effect and ambipolar diffusion .    in plasma physics , the term `` ambipolar diffusion '' refers to the diffusion of positive and negative particles at the same rate due to their coulomb interaction , which maintains the charge neutrality at scales larger than the debye length . in astrophysics",
    ", however , ambipolar diffusion usually refers to the decoupling of neutral and charged components .",
    "ambipolar diffusion causes the magnetic field to diffuse though neutral gas due to collisions between neutrals and charged particles , the latter being frozen - in into the magnetic field .",
    "the use of the same terminology applied to these two different phenomena may lead to confusion . in this paper",
    "we follow the astrophysical definition of the ambipolar diffusion . as for the hall effect",
    ", it appears as a result of the different drift velocities of electrons and ions , which are not equally affected by the presence of neutrals .",
    "the spatiotemporal scale over which the hall effect operates in a partially ionized plasma is very different from the case of a fully ionized plasma @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been an increasing number of works in the literature showing the importance of the deviations from mhd in different situations .",
    "the presence of neutral atoms in partially ionized plasmas significantly affects wave excitation and propagation @xcite .",
    "the relative motion between the neutral and charged species causes an increase of the collisional damping of mhd waves in the photosphere , chromosphere and prominence plasmas . this can be an important way to leak energy from alfvn and fast mode waves , causing the damping of coronal loop oscillations @xcite and prominence oscillations @xcite . under certain conditions , the leakage of alfvn wave energy can become the source of instabilities in the medium due to the non - ideal hall effect @xcite .",
    "the excitation rate of alfvn waves by foot - point motions of magnetic structures significantly decreases if the neutral component is taken into account @xcite .",
    "another effect is the possible appearance of cut - off frequencies for alfvn and kink waves , as mentioned by @xcite ( see , however , * ? ? ?",
    "the plasma partial ionization is also important for magnetic reconnection , for the same reason as for waves .",
    "@xcite has shown that the reconnection rate depends strongly on the collisional coupling between ionized and neutral species and @xcite concluded that , due to the action of ambipolar diffusion , oppositely oriented magnetic field lines can be brought sufficiently close to facilitate the reconnection . in a series of papers , @xcite ,",
    "@xcite , and @xcite applied a two - fluid approximation to study the reconnection between two current loops .",
    "the two - fluid approach allowed these authors to find different temperatures of the ionized and neutral species , and give rise to proton heating and jet - like phenomena that , possibly , can be the reason for footpoint heating of coronal loops , explosive events and jets in the transition region and sunspot penumbrae .",
    "all these non - ideal plasma effects can also modify the equilibrium balance of photospheric and chromospheric structures .",
    "an interesting mechanism to concentrate kilo - gauss magnetic flux tubes at photospheric level , due to the action of the hall current , was proposed by @xcite . at the chromosphere ,",
    "the order of magnitude stronger dissipation of currents perpendicular to the magnetic field , compared to that of longitudinal currents , was found to facilitate the creation of potential force - free field structures @xcite . in prominences , the frictional force generated due to collisions between neutrals and ions was found to play a role in supporting their structure against the gravitational force @xcite .",
    "another phenomenon affected by non - ideal plasma effects is magnetic flux emergence @xcite .",
    "these authors showed that the amount of emerged flux is greatly increased by the presence of a diffusive layer of partially ionized plasma .",
    "additionally , including neutrals removes the non - realistic lifting of low - temperature plasma into the lower corona and also avoids the subsequent rayleigh - taylor instability .",
    "all the examples given above indicate that incorporating non - ideal plasma effects is essential and can lead to new insights into the physics of many phenomena taking place in the solar photosphere and chromosphere . despite this increasing evidence ,",
    "we are far from a complete understanding of the influence of these effects .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to investigate the consequences of the joule dissipation of electric currents into the heating of the magnetized chromosphere . in the presence of neutrals , the ambipolar ( or neutral ) diffusion",
    "is expected to be orders of magnitude larger than the classical ohmic diffusion , leading to reynolds number around unity ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "diffusion by neutrals creates , in addition , anisotropy in the properties of the plasma since currents perpendicular to the magnetic field dissipate much quicker @xcite . due to that",
    ", one might expect important plasma heating .",
    "this work was inspired by the recent research by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , pointing in the direction that current dissipation , enhanced by the presence of neutrals in a plasma not entirely coupled by collisions , can play an important role in the energy balance of the chromosphere and above . in the rest of the paper",
    ", we will show analytical calculations and numerical simulations in different models ( from purely academic to more realistic ) of the amount of heating of chromospheric flux tubes due to the ambipolar diffusion effect .",
    "depending on the temporal and spatial scales under study , several approaches can be adopted to describe the multi - component solar plasma . without going into a kinetic description ( impossible to use in the photosphere and lower chromosphere because they are too dense ) , a detailed approach would consist in describing the three components @xmath0 neutrals , ions and electrons @xmath0 by a system of separate coupled equations ( three - fluid approximation ) .",
    "however , when the collisional coupling is large , a less detailed two - fluid ( adding up equations for electrons and ions ) or single - fluid ( adding up all three equations ) approximations can be used . here we adopt the latter approach .",
    "the derivation of the conservation equations for individual species in this case can be found in , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we consider a hydrogen plasma with three components : hydrogen ions ( @xmath2 ) , neutral hydrogen ( @xmath3 ) and electrons ( @xmath4 ) and assume elastic collisions and no chemical reactions in the system",
    ". a more complex composition of the plasma , to include other atoms , has no relevance for our study , since one can always define an average neutral or ionized atom .",

    "this form of the generalized ohm s law neglects the temporal variations of the relative ion - neutral velocity , the effects on the currents by the partial pressure gradients of the three species , and the gravity force acting on electrons .",
    "the diffusion coefficients are given by the formulae : @xmath38 the three terms on the right - hand side of the generalized ohm s law are , in order , the classical ohmic term , the hall term and the ambipolar or neutral term .",

    "thus , in this simple experiment we convert all the released magnetic energy into internal energy by means of joule dissipation of electric currents enhanced due to neutral diffusion ( the contribution of the ohmic diffusion is very small ) . as no energy dissipation mechanisms are considered in this toy simulation , the internal energy ( and temperature ) would be expected to ever increase with time . as was noted at the end of section 2",

    "in one possible scenario , once sufficiently high temperatures are reached , the plasma becomes totally ionized and the ambipolar diffusion coefficient becomes @xmath48 . in the second scenario",

    "the most important heating is reached at 1000 km height .",
    "the values given by the formula are in order - of - magnitude agreement with those obtained in the numerical experiment , suggesting that this formula can be used as an estimation .",
    "as the amount of heating depends on the initial magnetic field , less heating is reached at 1600 km , where we took the initial magnetic field to be only @xmath75 g.",
    "in this section , we describe the results of a similar simulation , but now in a gravitationally stratified isothermal model atmosphere . as initial magnetic field structure , we take the vertical flux tube with @xmath76 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : vtube ] ) .",
    "we made five simulations with the value of @xmath69 varying from 300 to 900 g. the atmosphere has initially a constant temperature of @xmath77 k and both pressure and density are stratified with a scale height of 157 km .",
    "note that now the atmosphere is not in horizontal force balance since @xmath78 is constant with height .",
    "the size of the simulation box is 1 mm by 1.65 mm with a resolution of 10 km .",
    "we take periodic boundary conditions in horizontal direction and closed boundary in both vertical directions .",

    "[ fig : etas ] , the ambipolar diffusion coefficient @xmath42 increases exponentially with height .",

    "thus , we expect the largest heating at the upper part of the simulation domain . to avoid any possible numerical artifact due to the conditions at the upper boundary we artificially decreased @xmath42 gradually to zero in the upper 15 grid points ( 150 km ) of the domain .",
    "to that aim , we used a third - order polynomial that matches the value of @xmath42 and its derivative in one end and reduces down to zero , and zero derivative , at a distance of 7 grid points ( 70 km ) .",
    "the rest of the points , up to 150 km , have @xmath42 equal to zero . this way",
    ", we make sure that the heating starts inside the physical domain , not influenced by the upper boundary .",
    "figure [ fig : b300evol ] shows the time evolution of the temperature and magnetic field strength in the simulation with initial @xmath79 g. the heating starts immediately at the central part of the tube in a few seconds time scale .",
    "the appearance of the temperature perturbation at the upper part of the simulation domain goes in agreement with the current distribution in the initial magnetic field configuration and also with the fact that the ambipolar diffusion coefficient reaches maximum values at 1.5 mm according to our simulation setup , and then reduced to zero at the topmost layers .",
    "it is evident from the figure that , in about 10-seconds time , the temperature increases about 2000 k from its initial value of @xmath77 k at heights around 1.5 mm , with a much lower variation in those layers where @xmath42 is artificially decreased .",
    "it must be noted that the perturbation introduced by @xmath80 also causes plasma motions . at the initial stage of the simulation ,",
    "these motions are upflows at the central part of the tube . due to the action of the advective term @xmath81 , the velocity motions transport hot material to the upper layers and heat them .",
    "this heating is thus a consequence of the transport of hot plasma and not the direct consequence of ambipolar diffusion .",
    "the amplitudes of the plasma motion do not exceed 100 m / sec and decrease with time as the tube evolves .",
    "the diffusion of the field causes its `` opening '' with height .",
    "the field becomes progressively more horizontal with time at heights above 0.8 mm , which is also a direct consequence of the increase of @xmath42 with height .",
    "the expansion of the field , together with the outward plasma motions , cause the temperature increase also in the surroundings of the flux tube , since the temperature perturbation is transported by the advective term of the energy equation .",
    "but the heating is the largest in the central part of the tube where the magnetic field is the strongest .",
    "also the time scales of heating inside and outside the flux tube are very different .",
    "while the central part of the tube is heated by several kk in a time interval of a few seconds , the surroundings take longer time to evolve and are heated by several hundred k in 5 - 10 minutes",
    ". however , the details of the behavior of the flux tube surroundings are not relevant for our study .    another visual impression from fig .",
    "[ fig : b300evol ] is that the heating at the central part of the tube stops after 100 sec of the evolution .",
    "it actually stops sooner , but this time moment is not shown in the figure .",

    "the material gets heated and the ionization fraction increases from @xmath83 to 0.5 .",

    "the above simulations have several concerns .",
    "firstly , the vertical flux tube is initially not in horizontal force equilibrium , which might cause an excess of the horizontal plasma motions and other side effects . in this respect ,",

    "[ eq : continuity ] , [ eq : momentum ] , [ eq : totalenergy ] , and [ eq : induction ] , the resulting differential equations for the evolution of the perturbations are solved .",
    "this means that , even if our flux tube is not initially in equilibrium , it can not evolve if no perturbation is applied to it . in our case",
    ", the ambipolar diffusion represents this perturbation , and without it no evolution is present .",
    "thus , the results of our calculation are determined by this parameter and not by the deviations from equilibrium .",
    "we can not disregard , though , that the exact evolution ( especially of the velocities ) may be influenced by the non - perturbed values .",
    "these can not , however , have any influence on the thermal evolution , which is fully determined by the ambipolar diffusion .",
    "the second concern may come from the adopted magnetic field strength , which is , possibly , too large as for a quiet chromospheric region .",
    "measuring magnetic fields in the quiet chromosphere may be challenging ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and actual measurements are lacking . in active regions , where the polarization signals are stronger ,",
    "non - lte inversions of the infrared  triplet and  lines have allowed @xcite to constrain the magnetic field strength to about 1.5 kg above sunspots and about 1 kg in a network region . as far as we are aware , the measurements for the quiet chromosphere are still missing .",
    "but , as a reasonable choice , one may assume values of about tens of gauss .    to address these two concerns ,",
    "in the next section we describe a simulation done in a more realistic flux tube model in equilibrium , with a lower field strength at chromospheric level , more representative a quiet area .",

    "different lines are separated 20 sec in time with progressively more red colors indicating larger times till 800 sec since the start of the simulation .",
    "note that the evolution gets slower with time .",
    "two horizontal blue lines mark the boundaries of the regions where @xmath42 is decreased to zero ( 1880 km ) and where @xmath48 ( 1940 km).,width=340 ]",
    "to simulate non - active chromospheric conditions , we used the 2nd - order thin magnetic flux tube as initial model atmosphere @xcite .",
    "previously , the same flux tube model was used for simulations of wave propagation from the photosphere to the chromosphere and it is described in the corresponding papers @xcite . the model represents a series of flux tubes that merge after some height in the chromosphere , preventing them from excessive opening with height .",
    "thus , the magnetic field configuration is non - potential and there are currents in the system .",
    "figure [ fig : ft2initial ] illustrates the initial distribution of some parameters of the flux tube model .",
    "the magnetic field strength ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ft2initial ] , upper left ) has both vertical and horizontal gradients .",
    "the colors of the figure are saturated at the bottom part of the structure to highlight the variations of the magnetic field in the chromosphere .",
    "the field is stronger at the central part of the tube , with about 37 g from 1 mm upwards .",
    "the ionization fraction defined as @xmath89 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ft2initial ] , upper right ) varies in agreement with the temperature distribution of the val - c model atmosphere .",
    "it has its lowest values in the photosphere , dropping down to @xmath1 and reaching about 0.7 in the upper part of the domain , at 1.5 mm . the ambipolar diffusion coefficient ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ft2initial ] , bottom left ) changes from @xmath90 in the photosphere up to @xmath91 in the chromosphere inside the flux tube ( note its artificial decrease in the upper 15 grid points , 120 km , done for the same reasons as in the simulation shown in the previous section ) .",
    "outside the flux tube , its value is very small , as the magnetic field strength outside the tube is negligible ( we set magnetic field outside the flux tube equal to some small value for reasons of numerical stability of the simulations ) .",
    "the most interesting quantity is the one shown at the bottom right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ft2initial ] .",
    "it gives a proxy of the diffusion term calculated as the square root of the current @xmath92 multiplied by the ambipolar diffusion coefficient ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : intenergy ] ) .",
    "as the variations of the magnetic field are stronger near the borders of each individual tube , the current is also stronger there .",
    "the absolute value of @xmath92 decreases according to the drop of the magnetic field strength with height , while @xmath42 exponentially increases .",
    "when multiplied one by the other , the quantity @xmath93 has largest values at the upper part of the domain above @xmath94 mm , near the borders of the tubes .",
    "this term is responsible for the heating , therefore we expect to observe the largest heating of the flux tube atmosphere at the locations where @xmath93 is important .",
    "figure [ fig : ft2evol ] gives several snapshots of the evolution of temperature in the flux tube after the diffusion terms were introduced as perturbation .",
    "same as before , the boundary conditions are taken periodic in the horizontal direction ( equivalent to an infinite series of flux tubes ) ; the domain is closed at the top and bottom boundaries ; and @xmath42 is decreased smoothly to zero at the upper 100 km of the simulation domain . except for velocity variations ( unimportant for the conclusions of the present study ) , closed boundary conditions do not affect the variations of any other quantity in our simulations .",
    "similar to the case of vertical flux tubes ( described in sect .",
    "[ sect : tuborecto ] ) , the heating starts at the upper part of the domain , close to the tube borders .",
    "this behavior is expected because the term responsible for the heating ( @xmath95 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ft2initial ] ) is orders of magnitude larger at these locations .",
    "the upper 120 km of the atmosphere , with artificially reduced @xmath42 , are not heated during the first few seconds , although the heat is transported there by the advective term in the energy equation from the material just heated below .",
    "the heating gradually extends beyond the tube borders and extends down into the atmosphere . the temperature at 1900 km reaches 8800 k after 800 sec of the simulation , which is about 2000 k above its initial value .",
    "the time scales of the heating are longer compared to the case of the vertical tubes with larger field strength .",
    "there is still no saturation after 800 sec of the simulation and the temperature is increasing slowly with time .",
    "the velocity field developed in this simulation is different from the case of vertical flux tubes ( sect .",
    "[ sect : tuborecto ] ) .",
    "the motion is mostly vertical and periodic in time , changing from upflows to downflows .",
    "such motion is a direct consequence of the closed upper and lower boundary conditions and the periodicity of our magnetic structure ( series of flux tubes in horizontal direction with mostly vertical field in the chromosphere ) .",
    "there is also no expansion of the field with height .",
    "the expansion is not possible as the tubes are located one next to the other .",
    "temporal variations of the ionization fraction , ambipolar diffusion coefficient and the parameter @xmath96 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ft2ionization ] .",
    "the values are taken at 1900 km close to the border of the tube at horizontal location @xmath97 mm .",
    "the initial ionization fraction at this height is already rather high . during the first 50 seconds of the simulation",
    ", it increases from 0.7 to about 0.9 .",
    "accordingly , the ambipolar diffusion coefficient drops by about an order of magnitude after the first 50 seconds .",
    "later , the evolution slows down and the further decrease of @xmath42 is more gradual .",
    "the change of the characteristic time scale is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ft2ionization ] . the time scale increases from 50 seconds ( initially ) up to 300400 seconds ( after 400 sec of the simulation )",
    "in the case of the vertical tubes ( sect .  [ sect : tuborecto ] ) , the variations of @xmath82 were stronger and the values of @xmath98 at the later stages of the evolution were much larger .",
    "the difference appears because , firstly , the initial magnetic field strength of the vertical tubes was much larger , causing a rapid heating and ionization within the first 20 seconds of the simulation .",
    "secondly , we considered lower heights up to 1500 km . the value of @xmath42 changes more than one order of magnitude between 1500 and 2000 km ( fig .",
    "[ fig : etas ] ) and so does the time scale .",
    "thus , while the evolution gets slower in time in the simulation with a 2nd order flux tube , it is not as slow as in the case of the vertical tubes .",
    "after the initial phase of the rapid evolution , the temperature in our 2nd order flux tube continues increasing on scales about 56 minutes .",
    "obviously , in a more realistic modeling , this constant energy input is expected to be balanced by some dissipation mechanism .",
    "otherwise , the simulation would eventually become unstable .",
    "however , here we are interested in understanding and evaluating the action of the heating ( not cooling ) term . for that reason",
    ", we considered a relatively simple situation that allows us to better constrain the physics .",
    "clearly , the final judgment about the heating efficiency of the proposed mechanism will require the inclusion of radiative energy exchange , a key mechanism for the chromospheric energy losses @xcite .",
    "finally , figure [ fig : ft2temp ] gives the temperature as a function of height at the horizontal location @xmath97 mm , close to the tube border , at different time moments .",
    "the atmosphere gets heated above 1100 km and the amount of temperature increase is larger at larger heights , except in the uppermost layers at the beginning of the evolution , where the ambipolar diffusion does not operate .",
    "the magnetic field strength has decreased on average by about 0.01 g at heights 11001900 km and @xmath97 .",
    "thus , we have dissipated only about 0.03% of the existing magnetic field .",
    "[ fig : ft2temp ] can be compared with fig .",
    "[ fig : dt ] , where we calculated the temperature increase @xmath54 assuming the same model atmosphere , but with 1% of the existing magnetic field at each height being dissipated .",
    "given that we have dissipated 30 time less magnetic field than it was assumed for the calculations of @xmath54 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dt ] , the results of our numerical simulations are in order of magnitude agreement with the simple estimation by eq .",
    "[ eq : formula ] .",
    "in this work , we have investigated the heating of the solar magnetized chromospheric plasma produced by current dissipation ( joule heating ) .",
    "the current dissipation is enhanced by orders of magnitude due to the presence of a significant amount of neutral atoms in the chromospheric plasma not entirely coupled by collisions . the net relative motion between the ionized and neutral plasma components results in an additional diffusion term ( ambipolar or neutral diffusion ) .",
    "the value of the ambipolar diffusion coefficient depends on the fraction of neutral atoms and on the magnetic field strength and can be as much as five orders of magnitude larger in the chromosphere than the classical ohmic diffusion coefficient .",
    "this implies evolution time scales of about 10100 seconds .",
    "thus , all the processes related to the ambipolar diffusion , including the plasma heating , happen very quickly .",
    "we have performed analytical estimates and numerical simulations in different models of the amount of plasma heating due to diffusion by neutral particles .",
    "the simulations covered a variety of scenarios , from a simple atmosphere without gravity to a more complex flux tube model , resembling a chromospheric quiet network area .",
    "all our calculations show that the lower chromosphere can be heated on temporal scales of @xmath90 seconds , giving rise to a temperature increase of several kk .",
    "the only requirements for the heating is the existence of a non force - free magnetic field .",
    "we obtain that the temperature increase is significant above a height of 1 mm , depending on the strength of the magnetic field .    from those results ,",
    "we conclude that current dissipation enhanced by the action of ambipolar diffusion is an important process that is able to provide a significant energy input into the chromosphere .",
    "we suggest that this mechanism should be included into the future models of chromospheric heating . here",
    "we would like to stress that , apart from possible dissipation mechanisms , the action of the ambipolar term in the energy equation would stop in two cases .",
    "firstly , this will take place if the temperature increase is so significant that all atoms become ionized leading to @xmath48 .",
    "obviously , this is not the case of the chromosphere which is observed to be , at least , partially neutral .",
    "note that our calculations indicate that the time scales of heating may become very long after a fast initial temperature increase ( see figures [ fig : ionization300 ] and [ fig : ft2ionization ] ) .",
    "this would mean that the actual complete ionization is never reached in a reasonable amount of time .",
    "secondly , the heating due to ambipolar diffusion will stop if the magnetic field configuration becomes force - free , meaning @xmath99 , i.e. @xmath74 .",
    "this might lead to different temperatures and ionization fractions for different starting magnetic field configurations and will need further detailed investigation . finally , the action of the ambipolar diffusion term has to be balanced by a dissipation mechanism .",
    "it is well known since the 60 s that the chromosphere is cooled by radiative losses @xcite . whether the proposed mechanism is able to balance these losses , and whether it is able to provide sufficient energy to support the chromospheric high temperature , has to be investigated in future realistic 3d mhd chromospheric simulations , including a detailed radiative transfer and all complex chromospheric physics .    here",
    ", we would just like to give hints that the temporal scales of the heating are defined by the magnetic field strength via the ambipolar diffusion coefficient @xmath42 ( eq .  [ eq : etaa ] ) . for the stronger fields considered by us ( @xmath100 g )",
    ", the heating happens very quickly , achieving a temperature increase of 23.5 kk in a 1 minute time . for the weaker field strengths ( 3040 g ) , expected in the quiet chromosphere ,",
    "the plasma is heated by 2 kk in a 10 minutes time .",
    "these time scales are comparable to the scales of radiative cooling of the plasma ( a simple newton formula gives characteristic cooling times at this height of the order of @xmath101 seconds , see * ? ? ?",
    "this argument may be used to suggest that one process might , in fact , balance the other .",
    "the radiative damping would tend to decrease the temperature in the chromosphere .",
    "this , in turn , would produce a decrease of the ionization fraction , a subsequent increase of @xmath42 and a decrease of the heating time scale ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : ionization300 ] and [ fig : ft2ionization ] ) .",
    "the neutral diffusion term would be put in action again , leading to a new temperature enhancement .",
    "the detailed temperature balance would depend on the details of non - lte chromospheric radiative transfer and on the scales of the non - lte ionization equilibrium .",
    "the present study has several limitations .",
    "the calculation of the ionization balance is done in lte conditions , assuming instantaneous ionization @xmath0 recombination .",
    "several recent studies have shown that the ionization - recombination of ( at least ) hydrogen and calcium in the solar chromosphere does not follow lte relations or instantaneous statistical equilibrium @xcite .",
    "in addition , we have discussed the energy losses by radiative damping , but have not included them in our simulations .",
    "thus , in the simulations shown in this paper , the temperature would ever increase until the chromosphere is ( unrealistically ) completely ionized or until the magnetic field configuration becomes force - free .",
    "this , however , was done on purpose since we wish here to investigate the action of a newly proposed mechanism in simple situations , to better understand its implications into the general picture . in our future studies",
    ", we plan to include the effects of radiative damping in our calculations .",
