    "was generally believed that the only fields which may extend outside the event horizon ( apart from external ones not related to the black hole itself ) are those associated with the conserved or topological charges carried by the hole .",
    "later a notable counter example to the naive no - hair conjecture was found in the framework of the einstein ",
    "yang  mills theory .",
    "although no classical glueballs may exist in the flat spacetime because of purely repulsive nature of the constituent vector fields , such particle - like objects become possible when gravitational attraction is taken into account ( bartnik  mckinnon ( bk ) solutions @xcite ) .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the lower mass bk particle topologically is similar to the sphaleron of the weinberg  salam theory , with a substantial difference , however , due to existence in the bk case of the gravitational negative mode .",
    "historically , just the gravitational instability of the bk solutions was discovered first @xcite and later invoked as an argument favoring the sphaleron interpretation of the bk solutions @xcite .",
    "more detailed analysis showed , however , that the _ gravitational _ ( even parity ) negative modes of the bk particles had nothing to do with an expected sphaleron picture .",
    "genuine sphaleronic features of bk solutions are manifest via the _ odd - parity _ negative modes along the vacuum - to - vacuum direction in the functional space @xcite .",
    "physically the lower mass bk solution may be seen as interpolating between the neighboring topologically distinct ym vacua in the eym theory .",
    "it carries neither electric nor magnetic charge , while the chern ",
    "simons number 1/2 is naturally associated with it @xcite .",
    "it was soon realized that the eym theory also admits the black hole counterparts to the bk solutions @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 eym black holes form a two - parameter family labeled by a continuously varying radius of the event horizon @xmath1 and the number @xmath2 of oscillations of the ym field in the strip @xmath3 $ ] bounded by the neighboring ym vacua values .",
    "since no asymptotic charges are present , these black holes apparently violate the no - hair principle .",
    "other solutions sharing the same property were found in the non - abelian gauge theories including scalar fields @xcite as well as in the gravity coupled skyrme model .",
    "meanwhile , a common feeling reasonably persisted that this kind of hair should be distinguished from the `` allowed '' hair associated with the global charges .",
    "it was suggested @xcite to interpret a non - abelian field structure outside the event horizon as a `` wig '' rather than a genuine hair .",
    "indeed , the eym black hole can lose its ym hair as a result of the gravitational instability leaving a bare schwarzschild black hole .",
    "as far as the black holes inside the magnetic monopoles are concerned , they were often thought of ( at least for the horizon radius much smaller than the monopole size ) as tiny schwarzschild black holes sitting inside the solitons @xcite .",
    "if so , the inside singularity should remain unaffected by the wig .",
    "however , little was known until recently about the realistic internal structure of non - abelian black holes ( apart from some qualitative discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "closer investigation @xcite has shown that the idea of a schwarzschild black hole sitting inside regular solitons is essentially incorrect .",
    "the interior structure and the character of the singularity inside the eym black hole with an arbitrary ( continuously varying ) radius of the horizon are strikingly different from those described by the schwarzschild geometry . both the schwarzschild and reissner  nordstrm type singularities ( predicted in @xcite )",
    "are encountered indeed , but only for some discrete values of the horizon radius .",
    "this `` second quantization '' in non - abelian black holes follows mathematically from the same kind of a non - linear boundary value problem ( now in the interior region ) as the `` first quantization '' of the bk particle mass . in this sense",
    "the picture of a schwarzschild black hole inside the bk particle covers only the set of solutions of zero measure in the parameter space .",
    "although it could be anticipated by continuity that the non - abelian hair should penetrate inside the event horizon , an essential role of hair in the formation of the singularity seems not to have been clearly realized before .",
    "a generic singularity in the spherically symmetric @xmath4-independent eym coupled system turns out to be spacelike and of the oscillatory nature as was often suggested in view of the bianchi ix analysis by belinskii , khalatnikov and lifshitz ( bkl ) @xcite . in the black hole context , however , the cosmological counterpart is given by the ( non - bianchi ) closed kantowski ",
    "sachs cosmology , and the nature of oscillations observed is rather different from that in the bkl case .",
    "our results @xcite concerning the eym generic black hole interior solutions were confirmed by breitenlohner et al .",
    "@xcite who also attempted to extend the analysis to monopole black holes in the eym - higgs ( eymh ) theory with the triplet higgs . in the latter case",
    "no oscillations were observed numerically , and the behavior of the mass function near the singularity was found to be monotonous .",
    "this behavior was interpreted in @xcite as exhibiting an exponential `` mass inflation '' . soon after we have found an analytical solution for the mass function @xcite in the @xmath0 eymh theories both with the ( real ) triplet and ( complex ) doublet higgs using a consistent truncation of the system of equations near the singularity .",
    "such a truncation is possible also in the eym ",
    "dilaton ( eymd ) theory @xcite , in both cases the behavior of the metric near the singularity is dominated by the kinetic ( gradient ) contribution of the scalar field . in terms of the radial dependence of the mass function one",
    "finds a _ power - law _ divergence towards the singularity .",
    "therefore no mass - inflation ( in the usual sense @xcite ) is detected inside the eymh black holes where the singularity is dominated by the scalar field .",
    "a similar scalar dominated asymptotic behavior was found earlier in the framework of the kantowski ",
    "sachs cosmology @xcite driven by a non - linear scalar field ( in the abelian model ) . in this latter case",
    "no black hole counterpart may exist because of the no - hair theorem for a non - linear one - component scalar field , but locally the solution is the same .",
    "our formula for the power - law mass function in the scalar - dominated regime was reproduced later in @xcite ( see this volume ) though without necessary restrictions on the power index following from the consistency of the truncation .",
    "it is worth noting that the domains of variation of the power index ( depending on the horizon radius of the black hole ) are different in the eymh and eymd cases , so in the kantowski ",
    "sachs interpretation the corresponding singularities look differently .",
    "the scalar - dominated singularity of the `` power - law mass - inflationary '' type inside spherical black holes in various field models including scalar fields seems to be a rather general phenomenon .",
    "this singularity is spacelike in conformity with the strong cosmic censorship .",
    "both oscillatory and the power - law singularities in hairy black holes therefore support this principle by the genericity argument .    the plan of the talk is as follows .",
    "first we discuss the local solutions near the singularity which may be seen as dressed schwarzschild and reissner ",
    "nordstrm singularities .",
    "then ( sec .",
    "3 ) we give an analytic description of the oscillatory approach to the singularity in the generic eym black holes . in sec .",
    "4 it is shown that no exponential mass inflation develops inside the eymh and eymd black holes where the typical power - law divergence of the mass function is met .",
    "we conclude with a brief discussion of a new role of the black hole hair which was revealed in the investigation of black hole interiors .",
    "we start with the pure @xmath0 eym system @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the @xmath0 field , assuming the metric to be invariant under the time translations and the @xmath7 spatial rotations : @xmath8 here the metric functions @xmath9 , @xmath10 depend only on @xmath11 .",
    "this parameterization of spacetime is suitable until a turning point of @xmath11 is reached .",
    "it happens that for asymptotically flat solutions there are no such points neither in exterior , nor in interior regions up to the curvature singularity at @xmath12 .",
    "such points exist , however , for asymptotically non - flat solutions , in which case another chart should be used @xcite . here",
    "we will not be dealing with _ a priori _ asymptotically non - flat solutions , so the coordinates ( [ eq2 ] ) are good both in the exterior and interior regions .",
    "of course one should keep in mind that in the region where @xmath13 the radial coordinate @xmath11 is timelike , while @xmath4 is spacelike , so that @xmath4-independence means spatial homogeneity of the spacetime rather than staticity .    as usual , we choose the @xmath4-independent spherically symmetric magnetic ansatz for the ym potential @xmath14 where @xmath15 are spherical projections of the @xmath0 generators .",
    "the value @xmath16 is a trivial ym vacuum , while @xmath17 corresponds to the vacuum of the next topological sector ( this state is related to the trivial vacuum by a `` large '' gauge transformation ) .",

    ", one has to explore first local solutions of the field equations near the singularity .",
    "two such local branches were found earlier @xcite .",

    ", one has @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 are ( the only ) free parameters .",
    "this local branch is non - generic already by counting free parameters ( a generic solution of the system ( [ eq4 ] , [ eq5 ] ) should have three free parameters ) .",
    "the second is the reissner ",
    "nordstrm type branch which can be found assuming the leading term of @xmath9 to be a positive constant ( related to the charge parameter @xmath35 ) .",
    "this requires @xmath36 and gives @xcite @xmath37 what corresponds to the rn metric of the mass @xmath33 and the ( magnetic ) charge @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",

    "these two local solutions may be regarded as describing `` hairy '' schwarzschild and reissner  nordstrm singularities . their essential distinction from the usual schwarzschild and reissner ",
    "nordstrm singularities consists in presence of the additional free parameters ( @xmath34 in the first case and @xmath41 in the second ) responsible for hair degrees of freedom .",
    "we have also found the third local power series solution @xcite assuming a _ negative _ value for @xmath42 ( i.e. , _ imaginary _",
    "@xmath43 ) : @xmath44 here there is only one free parameter @xmath45 for @xmath18 , @xmath9 .",

    "generic _ black hole . imposing boundary conditions in the singularity",
    ", we obtain the same kind of the singular boundary value problem as one encountered in the exterior problem where a similar role is played by the asymptotic flatness condition .",
    "this interior boundary value problem leads to the _ second quantization _ condition , now for the event horizon radius @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the eym black holes with the s and rn type interiors may constitute only the zero measure set in the whole eym black hole solution space .",
    "the system ( [ eq4][eq5 ] ) was integrated numerically in the region @xmath48 using an adaptive step size runge  kutta method for various @xmath49 .",

    "but it turns out to be an unstable fixed point of an asymptotic ( truncated ) dynamical system @xcite .",
    "deviations from this fixed point correspond to generic eym interior solutions sharing the same property to possess no cauchy horizons .",
    "more general families of internal solutions not restricted by the asymptotical flatness condition were found in @xcite ( in particular , other internal solutions of the third type ) .",
    "they do not have , however , a direct significance for the eym black holes .",
    "since both hairy schwarzschild and hairy reissner  nordstrm singularities are encountered only for certain discrete values of @xmath1 ( and hence the black hole masses ) , while the external solutions exist for continuously varying @xmath1 , we must look for an alternative regime of approach to the singularity for generic @xmath1 .",
    "it is generically observed during numerical integration from the events horizon towards the origin that sooner or later ( depending on @xmath1 and @xmath53 ) the metric function @xmath9 starts to oscillate in the negative region with a very fast growing amplitude @xcite . because of huge numbers encountered in these oscillations the accuracy of the computation can hardly be maintained , so one has to seek appropriate truncations of the system of equations to describe the asymptotic regime analytically .",

    "numerical experiments also show that while the ym function @xmath18 remains almost constant up to @xmath12 , its derivative is still non - zero and is rapidly changing on some very small intervals of @xmath11 . the function @xmath68 exhibits a step - like behavior being constant with high accuracy during almost all the chosen oscillation cycle ( fig .",

    "apart from the discrete picture given above one can find a truncated two - dimensional dynamical system clearly showing an infinitely oscillating nature of the generic solution .",
    "as we have already noted , the oscillation region starts with an exponential fall of @xmath9 which typically occurs after passing a local maximum @xmath109 ( fig .",

    "limiting value @xmath40 , and neglecting @xmath110 as compared with @xmath111 one can derive from the system ( [ eq4][eq5 ] ) the following two - dimensional dynamical system @xmath112 where @xmath113 , and a dot stands for derivatives with respect to @xmath114 .",

    "the class of oscillating solutions is stable in a sense that a small deviation from one such solution moves us to another oscillating solution .",

    "the dynamical system ( [ dsys ] ) was derived in our paper @xcite and reproduced in a slightly different notation in @xcite .",

    "the new features observed in the interiors of non - abelian black holes are due to the field components which are not connected with the conserved charges and are usually termed as a hair .",
    "violation of the no - hair conjecture in black holes traditionally was attributed to their external appearance .",
    "new results clearly show that the hair is equally important for the _ internal _ structure of black holes .",
    "hair `` roots '' penetrate up to the singularity supplying it with additional degrees of freedom .",
    "a tiny black hole inside a large magnetic monopole generically has a very different internal structure than the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "hairy black holes have hairy singularities .",
    "qualitatively speaking , the interiors of the eym black holes look like the hair - perturbed schwarzschild or reissner  nordstrm interiors .",
    "so it is not surprising that one encounters an exponential growth of mass whenever the metric reaches an `` almost '' cauchy horizon .",
    "this phenomenon , first noted in @xcite and termed as `` mass inflation '' in @xcite , is , however , only a half of the story . in the oscillating regime",
    "one observes two qualitatively different `` mass - inflations '' : the first is the local inflation at some very short interval of each oscillation cycle , the second is associated with the exponential growth of mass from cycle to cycle @xcite while the singularity is approached .",
    "if scalar fields are present , the dynamics gets a new dimension .",
    "once the scalar component is excited , it soon becomes a dominant factor of the evolution which changes drastically the approach to the singularity . in the scalar - dominated regime",
    "no mass - inflation is manifest , instead one observes a behavior which we call a `` power - law mass - inflation '' , i.e. , a power - fashion divergence of the mass - function near the singularity .",
    "this behavior has a different origin as compared with the usual mass - inflation , in particular , it is not related to an approach to the cauchy horizon .",
    "rather it follows from the coupled einstein ",
    "scalar field dynamics which is essentially abelian .",
    "indeed , the same behavior near the singularity was earlier observed in the kantowski ",
    "sachs cosmology with a non - linear ( one - component ) scalar field source .",
    "still the non - abelian nature of the model is substantial , otherwise the ( asymptotically flat ) static black holes are prohibited by the no - hair theorems .",
    "the analysis given here is purely classical , a few words are in order about the relevance of the results to the full quantum theory .",
    "vacuum polarization of the conformal scalar field on the hmi background was considered in @xcite .",
    "it was found that the correction to the mass function diverges more strongly than in the classical case .",
    "hence the singularity is not smoothened but rather intensified . in the oscillating regime",
    "there is no hope to compute quantum effects quasi - classically .",
    "moreover , huge values of the mass function ( in planck s units ) encountered soon after entering such a regime indicate that the quantum behavior of the model should be considered nonperturbatively and may well be qualitatively different from the classical picture .",
    "however , the conclusion about the spacelike nature of the generic singularity is unlikely to be changed .",
