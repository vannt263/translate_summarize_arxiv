    "this presentation is devoted to the review and discussion of a new _ analytized _ model expression @xmath0 for the qcd running coupling recently devised  @xcite by combining the rg - summed expression @xmath1 with the demand of analyticity , that is causality , in the @xmath2 complex plane .",
    "this procedure `` cures '' the ir ghost - pole trouble by an additional contribution that is non - analytic in the coupling constant and at the same time preserves the asymptotic freedom property and correspondence with perturbation theory in the uv .",
    "the `` analytization procedure '' elaborated in the mid - fifties ( see ref.@xcite ) consists of three steps :     find an explicit expression for @xmath7 in the euclidean region @xmath8 by standard rg improvement of a perturbative input .",
    " perform the straightforward analytical continuation of this expression into the minkowskian region @xmath9 .",
    "calculate its imaginary part and define the spectral density by @xmath10 .",
    " using the spectral representation of the kllen  lehmann type with @xmath11 in the integrand , define an `` analytically - improved '' running coupling @xmath0 in the euclidean region .",
    "being applied to @xmath12 in the one- and two - loop qed \\{or qcd } case , this procedure produces ( see ref .",
    "@xcite \\{or  @xcite } ) an expression @xmath0 with the properties :    \\(a ) it has no ghost pole ,    \\(b ) in the complex @xmath13-plane at the point @xmath14 it possesses an essential singularity @xmath15 , with @xmath16 , the one - loop beta - function coefficient ,    \\(c ) in the vicinity of this singularity for real and positive @xmath13 it admits a power expansion that coincides with the perturbation input ,    \\(d ) it has the finite uv \\{or ir } limit @xmath17 that _ does not depend on the experimental value _",
    "@xmath18 \\{or @xmath19 .",
    "in the one - loop qcd case this expression is of the form @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the same procedure being applied to the two - loop case yields  @xcite a more complicated expression with the same essential features ( see , e.g. , eqs .",
    "( [ rho2 ] ) - ( [ spectral ] ) below ) .",
    "instead of ghost pole has a weak singularity at @xmath23 and its ir limit @xmath24 depends only on group factors .",
    "numerically , for @xmath25,we have @xmath26 .    note , to relate @xmath27 , the qcd scale parameter , to @xmath28 , in our case we have to change its usual one - loop definition for @xmath29 $ ] with the function @xmath30 defined by the transcedental relation @xmath31~\\,\\ ] ] which is consistent with the symmetry property @xmath32    the corresponding beta - function @xmath33 ^ 2}\\ ] ] is also symmetric @xmath34 and obeys the second - order zero at @xmath35  see fig .  1 .    usually , in perturbative qft practice , we are accustomed to the idea that theory supplies us with a set of possible curves for @xmath36 and one has to fix the `` physical one '' by comparing with experiment . here , eq .  ( [ a1 ] ) describes a family of such curves for @xmath0 forming a bundle with the same common limit at @xmath23 .    for the two - loop case , we start with the running coupling written down in the form @xmath37 with @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "this expression corresponds to the result of exact integration of the two - loop differential rg equation explicitly resolved by iteration .",
    "it generates a popular two - loop formula with the @xmath40 term . for the spectral density , we have @xmath41 with @xmath42 @xmath43 now , to obtain @xmath44",
    ", one has to substitute eq .",
    "( [ rho2 ] ) into the r.h.s . of @xmath45",
    "the one - loop result , eq.([a1 ] ) , follows from eqs .",
    "( [ rho2 ] ) - ( [ spectral ] ) at @xmath46 .",
    "however , in the two - loop case , the integral expression thus obtained is too complicated for being presented in an explicit form .",
    "for a quantitative discussion one has to use numerical calculation .    nevertheless , for a particular value at @xmath23 we can make two important statements .",
    "first , the ir limiting coupling value @xmath3 does not depend on the scale parameter @xmath27 .",
    "second , this value turns out to be defined by the one - loop approximation , i.e. , its two - loop value coincides with the one - loop one ( for detail see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "thus , the @xmath3 value , due to the rg invariance , is independent of @xmath27 and , due to the analytic properties , of higher corrections .",
    "this means that the analyticity stabilizes the running coupling behavior in the ir , makes it universal .    moreover , the whole shape of the @xmath0 evolution turns out to be quite stable with respect to higher corrections .",
    "the point is that the universality of @xmath3 gives rise to stability of the @xmath47 behavior with respect to higher correction in the whole ir region ( at @xmath48 ) . on the other hand , stability in the uv domain",
    "is reflection of the property of asymptotic freedom . as a result ,",
    "our analytical model obeys approximate  higher loops stability \" in the whole euclidean region .",
    "numerical calculation ( performed in the @xmath49 scheme for @xmath50 and 3 cases with @xmath51 ) reveals that @xmath52 differs from @xmath53 by less than 10% and @xmath54 from @xmath52 within the 1% limit , as it is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the idea that qcd running coupling can be frozen or finite at small momenta was considered in many papers ( see , e.g. , the discussion in ref .  @xcite and interesting theoretical model in refs .",
    "there seems to be experimental evidence in favor of such behavior . as an appropriate object , for comparison with our construction",
    ", we use the average @xmath55 that people manage to extract from jet physics data .",
    "empirically , it has been claimed  @xcite ,  @xcite that this integral at @xmath56 gev turns out to be a fit - invariant quantity with the estimate : @xmath57 .",
    "numerical results for it obtained by the substitution @xmath58 into eq .",
    "( [ aq ] ) with @xmath59 mev , corresponding to @xmath60 , are summarized in the table .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     note that a nonperturbative contribution , like the second term in the r.h.s .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) , reveals itself even at moderate @xmath61 values by  slowing down \" the velocity of @xmath36 evolution .",
    "for instance , at @xmath62 it contributes about 4% , which could be essential for the resolution of the  discrepancy \" between  low-@xmath61 \" and direct @xmath63 data for @xmath64 .",
    "as far as we have no explicit expression for the @xmath65 in the two - loop case , for a qualitative discussion we can use an approximate formula proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite which can be written in the form of eq .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) with the substitution @xmath66.\\ ] ]    with appropriate redefinition of @xmath27 , the accuracy of this approximation , for @xmath67 , is no less than 5% .",
    "at the same time , it produces only a 3% error in the @xmath68 value .",
    "it is important to discuss the possibility of using @xmath65 in multi - prong qft objects @xmath69 and , particularly , in observables @xmath70 with some arguments @xmath71 being time - like ( minkowskian ) and some others fixed on the mass shell .    here",
    ", we have in mind a few different items :    1 .   the possibility of using rg for @xmath72-prong vertices @xmath73 ; 2 .",
    "the technology of using @xmath65 , originally defined for @xmath74 , in observables + @xmath70 with time - like arguments ; 3 .   the expediency of the @xmath65 continuation into the minkowskian region @xmath75 ; 4 .   the scheme dependence of analytic running coupling .",
    "relation to divergencies .",
    "our preliminary comments on these issues are :    i. as it is well known from the old investigations , the use of rg , rigorously deduced from dyson renormalization transformations ( with finite real counterterm coefficients @xmath76 ) , is justified only in the euclidean domain and involves a simultaneous change of a scale for arguments of @xmath77 , i.e. , @xmath78 .",
    "this restricts the possibility of uv analysis by the so - called non - exceptional momenta .",
    "nethertheless , in some special cases it turns out to be possible to apply the rg technique to analyse multi - prong object by involving some additional means like spectral representations  @xcite , light - cone expansion or amplitude factorization  @xcite .    in any of above - mentioned cases the rg procedure results in solving group equations for real functions , like spectral densities and light - cone expansion coefficients",
    "this solution involves only real running coupling @xmath65 values for euclidean arguments . any observable @xmath79 with time - like value of kinematic invariant @xmath80",
    "should be treated separately with an adequate procedure of analytic continuation of the observable under consideration .",
    "\\iii . due to the last reason",
    ", the analytic continuation of the running coupling itself , e.g. , discussing of @xmath65 properties in the minkowskian region @xmath75 , in our opinion , has no direct physical meaning .",
    "the last but not least is the property of the scheme dependence of the model discussed .",
    "formally , in our final expressions , eqs .",
    "( [ rho2])([spectral ] ) , there is no room for such dependence .",
    "this is related to the absence of uv infinities with their subtraction and renormalization ambiguities .",
    "the analytical model has an important property . by construction",
    "it is _ free from uv divergencies_. the log squared in the spectral function denominator ( [ rho2 ] ) provides us with convergence of non - subtracted spectral representation ( [ spectral ] ) . at the very end",
    ", it contains only one parameter @xmath27 that has to be defined from experiment .",
    "however , this needs an adequate procedure ( mentioned above in the comment ii ) of analytization with possible liberating of infinities by contribution non - analytic in @xmath13 for the observable confronted with data .",
    "+ to summarize , it can be said that to get more satisfactory answers and , correspondingly , more complete understanding , it is necessary to continue investigation of all four issues .",
