    "the nature of the contact to a semiconductor at point breakdowns in ultrathin oxides , is not well understood .",
    "an important observed feature of these contacts is that they can have a high minority carrier injection ratio .",
    "there have been a number of attempts to model point breakdowns in ultrathin oxides on silicon  @xcite .",
    "these models concentrate on the physics at the contact interface and attempt to derive the current vs voltage ( @xmath0 ) characteristic . however , in many physical devices the main contribution to the @xmath0 characteristic is due to the conduction in the bulk of the semiconductor .",
    "therefore , one should include a model of the bulk conductivity in an explanation of point contact behavior . in this paper ,",
    "such a model is developed using standard semiconductor equations solved for point contacts with minority carrier injection .",
    "this problem has the same geometry as the spreading resistance problem .",
    "the difference is that the spreading resistance problem assumes an ohmic contact and only majority carrier conduction . in the point contact problem",
    "arbitrary levels of minority carrier injection will be included .",
    "this calculation will assume high - level injection , which implies that there is charge neutrality in the bulk .",
    "this means that the number of excess holes ( beyond the equilibrium concentration ) is equal to the number of excess electrons .",
    "since the bulk is neutral , the laplace equation can be used to find the electric field , @xmath1 the remaining equations needed to describe conduction in a semiconductor are the continuity equations for holes and electrons along with expressions for the hole and electron current in terms of drift and diffusion  @xcite . for high - level injection , as in the case of high forward bias of a pn junction  @xcite",
    ", these equations reduce to @xmath2 for holes and electrons .",
    "@xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) is the total hole ( electron ) concentration , @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) is the excess hole ( electron ) concentration , and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) is the equilibrium hole ( electron ) concentration , so that @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "@xmath11 is the high - level diffusion length , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are hole and electron mobilities , @xmath15 is the hole diffusion constant , and @xmath16 is the hole lifetime . a similar equation can be written for @xmath17 . since @xmath18 and @xmath19 , then @xmath20 .",
    "these equations must be solved for the boundary conditions of the contact .",
    "a semi - infinite structure will be used , where the surface of the semiconductor is on the @xmath21-@xmath22 plane and the bulk of the semiconductor extends in the positive @xmath23 direction to infinity .",
    "the potential at infinity will be taken as 0 .",
    "there are mixed boundary conditions on the @xmath21-@xmath22 plane .",
    "similar mixed boundary conditions , for the laplace equation , are used in the solution of the usual spreading resistance problem  @xcite . outside the contact radius @xmath24 ,",
    "the current through the surface and the perpendicular component of the electric field are 0 .",
    "the boundary conditions on the contact are given by specifying the hole and electron currents through the contact .",
    "these conditions are set on the semiconductor side of the contact in order to avoid the physics of the contact interface .",
    "the problem is cylindrically symmetric about the @xmath23-axis which is perpendicular to the center of the contact .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : pcont ] ) can be written ( ignoring the @xmath25 dependence ) in cylindrical coordinates , @xmath26 this is the helmholtz equation .",
    "it can be solved by separating variables . using the boundary condition that the potential is zero for @xmath27 , @xmath23 at infinity ,",
    "the solution for excess hole concentration is @xmath28^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\,z ) } \\mathrm{d}\\lambda.\\ ] ] @xmath29 is a bessel function of order 0 .",
    "the function @xmath30 must be found using the remaining boundary conditions .",
    "a similar solution for the electron density can be written .",
    "an analytic solution can be found if @xmath30 is chosen to be @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a bessel function of order 1 , @xmath33 is a constant , and @xmath34 . with this choice , the current density over the area of the contact is approximately constant for @xmath35 .",
    "the electric field at the contact must be consistent with the current , which implies that the on the area of the contact the @xmath23 component of the field is @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a constant . since , in the high - level injection case , @xmath38 , the solutions can be equated and values of @xmath33 and @xmath37 determined for any given values of total hole current , @xmath39 , and electron current , @xmath40 .",
    "the potential at the center of the contact can be found from the solution of the laplace equation and thus the @xmath41 vs @xmath42 curve can be calculated .",
    "the numerical results below use typical values of parameters for silicon .",
    "the solution for @xmath37 and the resistance can be approximated as @xmath46 @xmath47 is somewhat dependent on @xmath24 , but is approximately equal to @xmath48 .",
    "it is seen that as the electron current gets large , the electric field coefficient tends to a constant .",
    "this is opposed to the normal ohm s law behavior where the electric field is proportional to current .",
    "the resistance of the contact actually decreases as @xmath49 as opposed to the ohmic behavior of a constant resistance .",
    "a single point breakdown device was fabricated by opening a 100 nm square window in a thick ( 20 nm ) sio@xmath50 insulating layer on a 6@xmath51 cm p - type silicon wafer . a thin sio@xmath50 layer ( 2 nm )",
    "was grown in this opening and an indium tin oxide top electrode was deposited on top of this  @xcite .",
    "the device was voltage stressed to create a hard breakdown .",
    "iv data of this breakdown site is presented in figure  [ iv - a5b ] .",
    "theoretical @xmath0 curves were calculated assuming a constant electron injection ratio .",
    "a constant voltage was added to model the voltage drop across the contact interface for large current .",
    "the experimental current is more than 10 times larger than the calculated current for only hole injection . considering the curvature at low currents ,",
    "the best fit is for @xmath44 nm and an electron injection of 74% . with smaller values of @xmath24",
    "the theoretical curve is not straight and can not fit the measured data .",
    "a reasonable fit can be obtained for a range of contact size , however it is clear that the electron injection ratio is between 70% and 75% .",
    "this demonstrates that a large minority injection ratio exists for these devices .",
