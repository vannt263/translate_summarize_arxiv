    "the ultimate goal of our work was to explore systematically a wide range of solar models with relatively modest amounts of mass loss on the early main sequence , and to test their viability via helioseismological measurements ( as well other observational constraints ) .",
    "this mass loss investigation is presented in our companion paper `` our sun  v '' @xcite . since the consequences of moderate early solar mass loss are expected to be small , it is essential to understand the consequences of uncertainties in the input physics and in the input parameters of the solar model .",
    "the physics inputs include the equation of state , opacities , nuclear rates , diffusion constants , the treatment of convection ( including the possibility of overshoot ) , and the effects of rotation and mass loss . observed solar parameters include the solar age and the present solar radius , luminosity , surface composition , and solar wind .",

    "in particular , the major consequences arising from uncertainties in the present observed solar surface z / x ratio , in the basic chain rate , and in the diffusion constants for gravitational settling of helium and the heavy elements , have not been addressed sufficiently in the recent ( most accurate ) work of other investigators . to determine the consequences of these uncertainties , we computed standard solar models with various values of the z / x ratio , the chain rate , and the diffusion constants ( lying in the permitted ranges ) . to obtain a set of self - consistent results",
    ", we also investigated the consequences of a number of other uncertainties , namely , in other nuclear rates , in envelope opacities , in the equation of state , from different methods of handling interior opacities , and in the solar age , luminosity , and radius .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to present the effects of the above uncertainties on the run of the sound speed and density in the solar interior , and on the radius  @xmath10 of solar convection and the solar envelope helium abundance  @xmath12 .",
    "we also present the effects on the pre - main - sequence solar lithium depletion ( excluding rotation effects ) and on the production of solar neutrinos .",
    "( note that lithium depletion in a non - rotating standard solar model occurs entirely on the pre - main - sequence ; this predicted depletion is significantly smaller than the observed solar lithium depletion factor .",

    "the stellar evolution code used to compute these solar models is descended from that used earlier in our `` sun  iii '' paper ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , but has been extensively updated for improved accuracy , including provision for much finer zoning as well as up - to - date input physics .

    "[ equation - of - state ] ] equation of state : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the reference standard solar model used the opal equation of state @xcite in the interior , and the mhd equation of state @xcite where it was designed to be accurate , namely , in the outer envelope at @xmath19 ( this corresponds to @xmath20 and @xmath21 in the present sun ) .",
    "a version of the mhd equation of state computation program was kindly provided to us , and minor modifications allowed computation of the mhd equation of state for various hydrogen abundances and metallicities down to pre - main - sequence photospheric temperatures and even below . in both cases , the equation of state was interpolated in metallicity  @xmath22 as well as in hydrogen abundance  @xmath23 , temperature  @xmath24 , and density  @xmath25 , in order to take into account metallicity variations due to diffusion and nuclear burning .",
    "tables for the mhd equation of state were computed on the same @xmath26 grid as the opal tables , with the following exceptions : for mhd , the upper @xmath25  limit was slightly higher than for opal at low temperatures , but lower at high temperatures ( since it never exceeded @xmath27 ) ; below @xmath28 , intervals of @xmath29 were used for the mhd @xmath24-grid , the same as the average @xmath30 interval in the opal grid for @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) ; and for @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) , extra @xmath24-grid points were added to double the density of the grid as a function of temperature in this region . by computing some mhd tables at intermediate grid - values , the interpolation accuracy in each of @xmath26 was tested . in the outer solar convective zone ( @xmath35 ) , the fractional error in the pressure  @xmath36 was @xmath37 , and for derivative quantities such as @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and  @xmath41 , the fractional error was @xmath42 ; deeper in the sun ( @xmath43 ) , the interpolation errors were nearly an order of magnitude smaller .",
    "the interpolation accuracy is thus several times better than the quoted precision of the opal equation of state in the corresponding regions @xcite .",
    "variant cases were tested where the opal equation of state was used down to @xmath44 or even all the way down to its lower limit of validity at @xmath45  in the latter case , the mhd equation of state was relevant only to the pre - main - sequence evolution .",
    "the mhd equation of state tables computed for this work considered h and  he , plus a 13-element subset of the @xcite heavy element composition ( i.e. , c , n , o , ne , na , mg , al , si , s , ar , k , ca , and  fe ) ; besides the effects due to neutrals and ions , effects due to h@xmath46 , h@xmath47 , and  h@xmath48 were accurately taken into account , and approximate effects of the molecules c@xmath47 , n@xmath47 , o@xmath47 , ch , cn , co , nh , no , oh , co@xmath47 , and  h@xmath47o ( although these molecules have no effect for solar models : they were actually added in anticipation of use in asymptotic giant branch models ) .",
    "the opal equation of state considers only h , he , c , n , o , and  ne ( plus hydrogen - molecule effects ) ; however , the equation of state is quite insensitive to the precise makeup of the metallicity , and the opal equation of state may well be the more accurate one in the region where both are valid @xcite .",
    "it has been noted that patching together equations of state can introduce spurious effects @xcite .",
    "such spurious effects were minimized in the present work by ( 1 )  performing a gradual switchover over a finite density or temperature region , to avoid any discontinuities , and ( 2 )  choosing switchover regions where the two equations of state were quite similar .",
    "the three switchover regions comprised @xmath49 ( corresponding to @xmath50 in the present sun ) , @xmath51 , or @xmath52 ; in the first and last of these regions , the mhd and opal equations of state under solar conditions differ typically by several parts in  @xmath2 ( with differences in the pressure  @xmath36 being several times smaller than this ) , i.e. , only a few times worse than the expected precision of the equations of state .",
    "near @xmath44 , the differences were nearly an order of magnitude smaller ( and also remained small over a very wide range of densities ) .",
    "any spurious effects from the switchover should be smaller than spurious effects arising from the fact that the opal equation of state is not self - consistent , with the size of the inconsistency ( in the outer solar envelope ) being comparable to the size of the differences between the opal and mhd equations of state ( as discussed in ",

'' the online opacity computation feature of the opal web page[multiblock footnote omitted ] allowed computation of opal opacities appropriate to the more recent @xcite `` gs98 '' mixture ( `` @xmath55 '' ) ; these were tested in variant models , as were opacities appropriate to the older @xcite `` gr84 '' mixture ( `` @xmath56 '' ) .",
    "the even older and much less accurate los alamos ( laol ) opacities `` @xmath57 '' were also tested in one case . at cool envelope temperatures ( @xmath58 ) ,",
    "our reference standard solar model used the @xcite opacities `` @xmath59 '' ( which include molecular opacities ) .",
    "we also tested the effect of using the @xcite molecular opacities `` @xmath60 '' at cool envelope temperatures instead .    in our reference standard solar model , we did our best to account for temporal and spatial variations in the opacity due to composition changes from diffusion and nuclear burning .",
    "the opal opacity tables allow interpolation of the opacity as a function of the hydrogen abundance and the metallicity  @xmath22 ; the abundances of the metals comprising  @xmath22 are always proportional to  @xmath22 in the opal tables , i.e. , a `` scaled solar '' distribution .",
    "in addition , the opal opacity tables contain mixtures with excess carbon and oxygen ( beyond that contained in the scaled solar metallicity ) , allowing interpolation in carbon and oxygen abundances .",
    "to take into account the variations in abundance due to diffusion , the metallicity value  @xmath61 that we used for metallicity interpolation in the opal opacity tables was proportional to the abundances of the elements heavier than oxygen : @xmath62 , where @xmath63 / [ \\sum_{heavy } ( x_i)_0 ] $ ] , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the protosolar metallicity and composition , respectively , and @xmath66 refers to a sum over elements heavier than oxygen . in other words , we scaled the initial solar metallicity by the shift in heavy element abundances resulting from diffusion ( note that our diffusion routines assumed that all metals diffused alike ) .",
    "however , for the cno elements , there are additional changes due to nuclear burning , so that the cno abundance profiles are not proportional to the heavy element abundance profiles ; @xcite find that conversion of c and  o into  n results in an opacity change of  @xmath67% that can not be modelled by a change in  @xmath22 alone .",
    "these variations in the cno elements relative to  @xmath68 were accounted for in an approximate manner by an additional two - dimensional interpolation in nominal `` excess carbon and oxygen '' abundances @xmath69 and  @xmath70 , where these excess abundances account for any variation in the cno abundances relative to the scaled solar metallicity  @xmath61 of the opal opacity tables .",
    "since there were no explicit opacity tables for changes in nitrogen , the best one could do was to distribute excess nitrogen equally between @xmath69 and  @xmath70 ( i.e. , to assume that nitrogen opacities were midway between those of carbon and oxygen ) : @xmath71 and @xmath72 , such that @xmath73 .",
    "note that in general , as first carbon and then oxygen is burned to nitrogen , either @xmath69 or  @xmath70 will be negative , implying _ extrapolation _ of the opal tables in the direction of zero c or  o by a non - negligible fraction of  @xmath22 .",
    "one might consider the uncertainties in such an extrapolation to be worse than the error inherent in treating all cno opacities alike ; in this case , if one of @xmath69 or  @xmath70 was negative , one would set it to zero and subtract an equivalent amount from the other ( so that the sum @xmath74 remains unchanged )  this was the method followed in our reference models .",
    "however , we also tested the case where negative values were allowed , extrapolating as required .",
    "these turned out to yield essentially identical results to the reference model : the rms difference was only  0.00006 in the sound speed profile @xmath75 and  0.0003 in @xmath76 , comparable to the estimated numerical accuracy of the models .",
    "an alternative case where this latter cno variation was not approximated by excess  co at all , i.e. , having @xmath62 but co@xmath77 , also yielded almost identical results ( rms difference of  0.00005 in @xmath75 and  0.0004 in @xmath76 ) .",
    "similarly negligible rms differences were found for several cases testing different prescriptions for defining  @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and  @xmath70 ( differing in whether mass fractions or number densities were used , in how the excess nitrogen was divided between @xmath69 and  @xmath70 , and in whether negative values were allowed for @xmath69 and  @xmath70 ) .",
    "finally , one run was computed where cno - interpolation in the opacities was actually performed .",
    "in addition to the standard opal opacity table , the opal web page[multiblock footnote omitted ] was used to compute an opacity table with a composition where c had been converted to  n , and one where both c and  o had been converted to  n ; the model cno abundances were used to interpolate in opacity among these tables .",
    "this `` cno - interpolation '' model also yielded results essentially identical to the reference model ( an rms difference of  0.00006 in @xmath75 and  0.0005 in @xmath76 ) .",
    "an estimate for the upper limit of the effects of opacity uncertainties was made by simply setting @xmath78 for a constant factor  @xmath79 , 0.95 , 1.0 , 1.05 , or  1.10 ; note that the case @xmath80 is only slightly different from the reference standard solar model .",

    "it is worth noting that , in the past , pre - main - sequence lithium depletion in the sun has often been ignored or assumed to be negligible ( which is not the case , as our present models show ) .",
    "earlier models did in fact show relatively little pre - main - sequence solar lithium depletion , e.g. , a depletion factor of  3 was reported by @xcite .",
    "these low lithium depletion factors may have been caused partly by the use of older opacity tables in earlier models , but a major contributing factor was neglect of gravitational settling ( diffusion ) of helium and the heavy elements .",
    "these earlier models thus had a lower metallicity during the pre - main - sequence stage , matching the present solar surface metallicity , rather than being about 10% higher ( as diffusion models indicate ) . because of the strong metallicity dependence of pre - main - sequence lithium depletion , such models yielded relatively small depletion factors .",
    "pre - main - sequence lithium depletion depends quite sensitively on the structure of the solar models during that stage of evolution .",
    "we give our results in terms of the solar lithium depletion factor  @xmath325 , which is shown in table  [ tab : results ] .",
    "the zoning did not affect the lithium depletion factor significantly ; nor did the uncertainties in the solar age , luminosity , and radius .",
    "changes in the equation of state in the outermost regions can have a small effect ( @xmath329% ) on the lithium depletion factor : the `` opaleos - midt '' and `` opaleos - lowt '' cases had lithium depletion factors of @xmath330 and  19 , respectively , as opposed to @xmath327 for the standard `` opaleos - hit '' case .",
    "the pre - main - sequence lithium depletion is extremely sensitive to both low - temperature and high - temperature opacities ; use of the @xcite molecular opacities instead of the @xcite ones halved the lithium depletion factor ( @xmath331 ) , as did our `` low-@xmath245 '' test case ( @xmath331 ) , while our `` high-@xmath245 '' test case nearly tripled it ( @xmath332 ) .",
    "there is also a relatively large sensitivity to the uncertainty in the observed solar abundances .",
    "a low @xmath5 ratio of  0.0203 ( with `` @xmath91 '' ) yields only two - thirds as much lithium depletion ( @xmath333 ) , while a high @xmath5 ratio of  0.0257 ( with `` @xmath90 '' ) yields half again as much lithium depletion ( @xmath334 ) .",
    "uncertainties in the diffusion constants can affect the lithium depletion factor significantly , primarily due to the effect of the different initial composition ; our diffusion test cases have depletion factors ranging from @xmath335 to  33 .    except for the @xmath336 rate ,",
    "uncertainties in the nuclear rates have almost no effect on the extent of lithium depletion . for the @xmath336 rate , the @xmath337% uncertainty quoted by",
    "the nacre compilation @xcite corresponds to an uncertainty of about @xmath338% in the depletion factor ( i.e. , a range in the from @xmath339 to  38 ) .",
    "[ [ solar - beryllium - abundance ] ] solar beryllium abundance : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the observed solar beryllium abundance is @xmath340 , consistent with no depletion relative to the meteoritic value of @xmath341 . the quoted uncertainties of these values imply that solar beryllium can not have been depleted by more than a factor of  2 ( 3-@xmath103 upper limit ) .",
    "our solar models all have negligible amounts of beryllium depletion , of order  1%  in good agreement with these observational beryllium results .",
    "other authors have shown that parameterized rotational - mixing models which match the observed solar lithium depletion yield relatively minor beryllium depletion , in agreement with observations .",
    "for example , the rotational - mixing solar models of @xcite , with total lithium depletion of a factor of order  100 ( a factor of  @xmath4 occurring on the main sequence ) , deplete beryllium by only about  12% .",
    "note that rotational - mixing models which ignore pre - main - sequence lithium depletion ( i.e. , which over - estimate the main - sequence lithium depletion by an order of magnitude ) might be expected to overestimate the beryllium depletion as well : for example , @xcite required main - sequence lithium depletion by a factor of  155 in their solar models with rotational mixing , and found that these models then implied beryllium depletion by a factor of  2.9",
    ".      we will not devote much space to the predicted solar neutrino values , since it has long been concluded that matching the observed neutrino capture rates requires not revised astrophysics but new neutrino physics , e.g. , mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) neutrino oscillation effects  even non - standard solar models ( e.g. , with core mixing or a low - metallicity core ) can not simultaneously satisfy the neutrino observations and the helioseismic constraints ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "<S> helioseismology provides a powerful tool to explore the deep interior of the sun . </S>",
    "<S> measurements of solar interior quantities are provided with unprecedented accuracy : for example , the adiabatic sound speed  @xmath0 can be inferred with an accuracy of a few parts in  @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this has become a serious challenge to theoretical models of the sun . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we have undertaken a self - consistent , systematic study of sources of uncertainties in the standard solar model , which must be understood before the helioseismic observations can be used as constraints on the theory . </S>",
    "<S> this paper focusses on our own current calculations , but is also a review paper summarizing the latest calculations of other authors . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the largest uncertainty in the sound speed  @xmath0 in the solar interior , namely , 3 parts in  @xmath2 , arises from uncertainties in the observed photospheric abundances of the elements : c , n , o , and ne have uncertainties of  @xmath3% , leading to an uncertainty of @xmath4% in the photospheric @xmath5 ratio . uncertainties of 1 part in  @xmath2 in the sound speed  @xmath0 arise , in each case , from ( 1 )  the @xmath6% uncertainty in the opal opacities , ( 2 )  the @xmath7% uncertainty in the basic @xmath8 nuclear reaction rate , ( 3 )  the @xmath3% uncertainty in the diffusion constants for the gravitational settling of helium , and ( 4 )  the @xmath9% uncertainties in diffusion constants for the heavier elements . </S>",
    "<S> ( other investigators have shown that similar uncertainties arise from uncertainties in the interior equation of state and in rotation - induced turbulent mixing . ) in the convective envelope _ only _ , uncertainties in  @xmath0 of order 1 part in  @xmath2 arise from the uncertainty of a few parts in  @xmath1 in the solar radius , and from uncertainties in the low - temperature equation of state . </S>",
    "<S> other current uncertainties , namely , in the solar age and luminosity , in nuclear rates other than the @xmath8  reaction , and in the low - temperature molecular opacities , have no significant effect on the quantities that can be inferred from helioseismic observations . </S>",
    "<S> significant uncertainty in the convective envelope position  @xmath10 ( of up to 3  times the observational uncertainty of @xmath11 ) arises only from uncertainties in @xmath5 , opacities , the @xmath8  rate , and helium diffusion constants ; the envelope helium abundance  @xmath12 is significantly affected ( @xmath13 ) only by extreme variations in  @xmath5 , opacities , or diffusion constants , and is always consistent with the `` observed '' range of helioseismically inferred @xmath12 values . </S>",
    "<S> our predicted pre - main - sequence solar lithium depletion is a factor of @xmath14 ( an order of magnitude larger than that predicted by earlier models that neglected gravitational settling and used older opacities ) , and is uncertain by a factor of  2 . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted neutrino capture rate is uncertain by  @xmath15% for the experiment and by  @xmath16% for the experiments ( not including uncertainties in the capture cross sections ) , while the 8b neutrino flux is uncertain by  @xmath15% . </S>"
