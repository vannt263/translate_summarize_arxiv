    "the rich chemistry of carbon is due to the capability of its electronic configuration to adjust to different bonding situation .",
    "carbon atoms realize three main hybridization schemes of the valence orbitals : @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath0 hybridization . @xmath1",
    "bonding tends to form three - dimensional networks , as in diamond and the related amorphous structures .",
    "@xmath2-hybridized orbitals lead to two - dimensional networks , at the basis of graphene , graphite , fullerenes , nanotubes , ribbon structures , and other forms of wide current interest for their unique mechanical and electronic properties .",
    "@xmath0-hybridized carbon forms linear structures ( carbynes ) , which , compared to their chemically more stable @xmath1 ( alkanes ) and @xmath2 ( alkenes ) hydrogenated counterparts , tend to be rigid , thus potentially appealing as backbones for molecular nanotechnology",
    ".    carbynes of increasing length and varied terminations are being synthesized @xcite and characterized.@xcite at the same time , the fabrication of carbon atomic chains from stretched nanotubes or graphene was achieved by controlled electron irradiation in transmission electron microscopes.@xcite the remarkable robustness of these carbon chains under irradiation combined with the ease of electron - beam fabrication at the nm scale can provide a route to the synthesis of actual nano - devices based on carbynes .",
    "recent investigations have elucidated the prominent role of molecular oxygen as a primary source of chemical degradation of @xmath0 carbon @xcite . in a pure - carbon environment carbynes",
    "are far more stable @xcite .",
    "effects of longitudinal straining @xcite and lateral bending @xcite were investigated very recently by _ ab - initio _ methods .",
    "the outcome of those studies is that carbyne chains are at one time extremely stiff against longitudinal straining and very soft against a bending deformation , to the extent that even extreme bending affects only moderately their bonding properties.@xcite in the present paper we focus on the mechanical properties of carbynes in the perspective of exploiting them as construction materials for nano - engineering .",
    "we use _ ab - initio _",
    "simulations @xcite to predict the stiffness of the carbynes for both longitudinal strain and for bending , and their ultimate tensile strength .",
    "the main results of these simulations is that a sp carbon chain ( and it matters little whether it is of cumulenic  all double bonds , or polyynic  with alternating single - triple bonds ) exhibits not only an exceptional mechanical stiffness against longitudinal deformations , but also a small but nonzero rigidity against bending .",
    "accordingly , a c@xmath3 chain resembles a thin beam characterized by a finite rigidity against buckling , rather than a string .",
    "we find that , e.g. , a single - carbyne c@xmath4 `` pillar '' can withstand a modest but non - negligible axial compression force @xmath5  nn before buckling .",
    "in simulations , one can tune the carbyne length by fixing the position of the end carbon atoms of a selected chain section , and leave all other atoms free to relax to their equilibrium position , compatible with the imposed strain . as well know to civil engineers ,",
    "as soon as the compressive stress exceeds a critical value , the straight configuration of a beam subject to a purely axial strain @xmath6 turns unstable and `` buckles '' spontaneously to a curved arc . in the simulations of highly strained configurations , it is straightforward to address either the metastable straight configuration , or the stable buckled configuration investigated in ref .  .    to characterize the mechanical properties of a carbyne segment , and in particular to evaluate the buckling transition , one needs to identify the correct linear - response parameteres in a simple model where the effects of different kinds of deformations can be decoupled and studied separately .",
    "the simplest continuum model describes a carbyne as a strained thin beam of a homogeneous material , thereby ignoring its discrete atomic structure .",
    "three basic deformations can be applied to the beam : longitudinal traction or compression ; lateral bending , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ model : fig ] ; torsion around its axis .",
    "correspondingly , the elastic deformation energy can be decomposed as : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the tensile energy increase due to longitudinal elongation / shortening , @xmath9 is the energy due to the pure flexion of the beam , and @xmath10 is the energy increase due to the twisting of the beam .",
    "remarkably , even this third term is important for the essentially 1d cumulenes.@xcite in the present work we will however mostly ignore torsion , and concentrate on the first two terms .    in the linear - response ( small - strain ) regime , we write the tensile energy in terms of the strained length @xmath11 relative to the fully relaxed length @xmath12 as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the elastic stiffness of the beam , and @xmath15 is the length - independent beam elastic tension : in the continuum mechanics of 3d solids @xmath16 , the product of the material s",
    "elasticity modulus times the beam transverse area .",
    "figure  [ model : fig ] indicates the relevant geometrical quantities characterizing the pure - bending deformations of a carbyne of fully relaxed length @xmath12 . in a circular - arc geometry ensuing from the application of a small bending moment @xmath17 at the beam ends , the bending energy can be derived by the linear relation of the deflection angle @xmath18 with the applied bending moment : @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the length - independent bending stiffness of the beam : in 3d continuum mechanichs @xmath21 , the product of the elasticity modulus times the second moment of area of the beam cross section .",
    "( the dimension of @xmath20 is force@xmath22area . ) for a circular deformation , the bending energy @xmath9 is therefore @xmath23    it is convenient to express all quantities in terms of clearly defined geometrical quantities , e.g.  the distance @xmath24 between the end points of the chain and the the maximum deflection @xmath25 from straight geometry .",
    "we have : @xmath26 with the implicit substitution of the expressions ( [ angle ] ) and ( [ length ] ) , the elastic energy of the beam stretched and/or bent in a circular arc is therefore @xmath27",
    "we determine the linear - response parameters @xmath15 and @xmath20 by means of simulations based on the density functional theory ( dft ) in the local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "the time - honored lda is one in many functionals being used for current dft studies of molecular systems : other functionals often improve one or another of the systematic defects of lda ( underestimation of the energy gap , small overbinding and overestimation of the vibrational frequencies ) , but to date no functional is universally accepted to provide systematically better accuracy than lda for all properties of arbitrary systems . for a covalent system of @xmath28 and @xmath29 electrons as the one studied here ,",
    "lda is appropriate , and we expect our results to change by a few percent at most if the calculations were repeated using some other popular functional.@xcite    we compute the total adiabatic energies by means of the plane - waves dft code quantum espresso.@xcite  ry@xmath30  pev , and push atomic coordinates relaxation until all force components are smaller than @xmath31  ry@xmath32  pn .",
    "we use ultrasoft pseudopotentials,@xcite for which a moderate cutoff for the wave function / charge density of @xmath33  ry is sufficient . to address isolated molecules in the repeated - cell geometry implied by plane waves ,",
    "we make sure that at least @xmath34  nm of vacuum separates all atoms in adjacent periodic images . ]",
    "we consider the two different limiting structures of carbynes : polyynes ( or @xmath35carbynes ) with alternating single  triple bonds (  @xmath36c@xmath37c@xmath36c@xmath37c@xmath36  ) , contrasted to cumulenes or @xmath38carbynes , with nearly - equal - length ( double ) bonds (  = c = c=  ) .",
    "a typical polyynic chain is obtained when each end carbon atom forms a single bond with a ligand ( e.g.  a hydrogen atom , as in diacetylene ) , while a typical cumulene is obtained when each end carbon forms a double bond , for example to a ch@xmath39 group , as in ethylene .",
    "we focus on a c@xmath4 chain segment , and compare its mechanical response in its hc@xmath39-c@xmath4-c@xmath39h polyynic and h@xmath39c - c@xmath4-ch@xmath39 cumulenic realizations . for the polyyne , we select hydrogenacetylide terminations rather than a single hydrogen because the hc@xmath39- group allows us to impose a bending moment at the ends of the c@xmath4 chain as in fig .  [ model : fig ] , by displacing a c atom along the chain continuation rather , than a chemically different h atom , thereby probing the intrinsic properties of carbyne , rather than those of a specifically - terminated compound .",
    "we also consider c@xmath40 polyyne of different lengths , to check for size effects , and a @xmath41 end - twisted c@xmath4 cumulene , which we must treat within the local spin - density approximation ( lsda ) since twisting induces a peculiar total spin-1 electronic state , with a twofold - degenerate level occupied by two parallel - spin electrons.@xcite we do not attempt any serious size scaling , for two main reasons : ( i ) very long carbynes are mechanically unstable ( thus unsuitable for nanomechanical applications ) anyway , and ( ii ) the long - range interaction effects demonstrated recently @xcite would make a proper _ ab - initio _ size - scaling determination of the mechanical ( in particular bending ) properties of long carbynes prohibitively expensive . in the present work we do not deal with the exotic odd-@xmath42 c@xmath3 chains , which are chemically less stable and more difficult to synthesize.@xcite    to evaluate @xmath15 , starting from the fully relaxed carbyne we stretch or compress a straight c@xmath4 chain section by fixing the positions of the end carbon atoms , and letting all other atoms free to relax to their resulting equilibrium positions under stress .",
    "we extract an estimate of @xmath15 by fitting eq .   to the resulting values of the excess energy as a function of the chain elongation , as reported in fig .",
    "[ kfit : fig ] .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     to evaluate the bending stiffness @xmath20 , we force the chain to bend by imposing a small lateral displacement of the two atoms adjacent to the c@xmath4 section of the chain , while keeping the first and last atom in the chain section bounded to remain laterally undisplaced , following the scheme of figs .",
    "[ model : fig ] and [ gfit : fig ] ( inset ) .",
    "we then let all other degrees of freedom ( including the axial position of the laterally bounded atoms ) of the chain relax .",
    "the c@xmath4 section relaxes to form a circular arc , which we fit by minimizing the squared distance of the relaxed atomic positions in the @xmath43 plane from the circular arc @xmath44 , whose radius @xmath45 is determined by taking into account the separation @xmath24 of the terminal atoms of the c@xmath4 chain section , namely those kept at @xmath46 . ] to extract the geometrical quantities indicated in fig .",
    "[ model : fig ] .",
    "note that this procedure differs substantially from the fixed - end approach of ref .",
    ", where longitudinal and bending strains are applied at the same time , and deviations extend well outside the linear - response region . in the language of that work , the maximum arc - chord ratio in our calculations is @xmath47 .",
    "we repeat this procedure for several values of the fixed lateral displacements . with the computed dft energies and structures",
    ", we extract the values of @xmath20 by fitting the angular dependency of @xmath9 in eq .",
    ", see fig .  [ gfit : fig ] .",
    "the resulting elasticity parameters @xmath15 and @xmath20 are collected in table  [ values : tab ] . despite the different bonding configuration of polyyne and cumulene , the overall longitudinal elasticity @xmath15 values are remarkably similar .",
    "the value of @xmath15 is compatible with a sound velocity @xmath48  km / s for long - wavelength longitudinal vibrations ( @xmath49 is the linear mass density ) . in view of the long - range interactions",
    "demonstrated recently @xcite , the weak dependence of @xmath15 on the chain length is remarkable .",
    "the bending stiffness @xmath20 is comparatively more sensitive to the chain length , see also fig .",
    "[ gscale : fig ] .",
    "if this velocity is used to evaluate the highest - frequency brillouin - zone  boundary phonon in a simplest mass - spring chain , one obtains a frequency @xmath50  thz , i.e.  a wave number @xmath51  @xmath52 , expectedly slightly above the region of the observed high - frequency raman and infrared modes emerging as the characteristic spectroscopic signatures of the carbynes.@xcite    the cumulene is anisotropic : one can make it bend either within the molecular plane , as sketched in the inset of fig .",
    "[ gfit : fig ] , or perpendicularly to it , resulting in differently oriented double bonds @xcite being perturbed .",
    "we find that bending is significantly softer for the out - of - plane distortion than for the in - plane one , with a @xmath53% anisotropy .    the proposed cosine expression for the strain energy given in eq .  ( 9 ) of ref .",
    "is compatible with our eq .   for small curvature",
    "( although a small amount of longitudinal strain energy is neglected there ) .",
    "the relation @xmath54 obtained based on the average bond length @xmath55  pm and orientation - dependent bonding strength @xmath56  ev as obtained in ref .",
    "yields @xmath57  nn/(nm)@xmath58 , in good agreement with our result , especially with the c@xmath59 chain value .",
    "this agreement is even more surprising in view of the extreme deformations introduced in ref .  , and indicates that the linear - response coefficient of eq",
    ".   extends well outside its validity region , provided that the cosine espression eq .",
    "( 9 ) of that work is adopted .    according to elementary continuum mechanics,@xcite the critical axial load that a beam can sustain in its straight configuration before the onset of the buckling instability",
    "is given by euler s formula @xmath60 corresponding to a critical strain @xmath61 for a critical sinusoidal lateral deformation profile . by substituting the computed values for @xmath15 and @xmath20",
    ", we find that the c@xmath4 carbyne sustains a critical strain of nearly @xmath62% , under the action of a critical force of approximately @xmath63  nn , before buckling , as reported in table  [ values : tab ] . the corresponding critical strain and force for cumulene ( in the softer out - of - plane direction )",
    "are essentially equal .",
    "the computed values are relevant when both ends of c@xmath4 are pinned ( hinged , free to rotate ) , while if both ends were frozen , the critical force and strain would be four times larger .",
    "likewise , following eqs .   and , @xmath64 decays rapidly with size . for example , for c@xmath65 ,",
    "whose length is approximately 2.15 times that of c@xmath4 , @xmath66  nn , i.e.  approximately 20% of the c@xmath4 value only .",
    "direct calculation done for the c@xmath59 polyyne in hc@xmath39-c@xmath59-c@xmath39h agrees with this scaling , with a small deviation due mostly to a smaller value of @xmath20 , relative to the c@xmath4 value ( while @xmath15 is practically coinciding , see table  [ values : tab ] ) .",
    "we find it rather surprising that , despite the presence of in principle softer single bonds , the polyynic chain is essentially as hard to compress as double - bonds  based cumulene . the same essentially equivalent stiffness of polyyne and cumulene is found against bending deformations , but here the result is less unexpected .",
    "even a maximally twisted cumulene in a high - spin electronic state exhibits very similar mechanical properties , see table  [ values : tab ] .",
    "we check the obtained buckling critical point for possible effects of chain discreteness or anharmonicity , by running actual simulations .",
    "we compare pairs of dft simulations at fixed strain : one bound to the linear configuration as in fig .",
    "[ kfit : fig ] , and one starting off in a slightly curved geometry . in the curved simulations , below the buckling instability",
    ", the relaxing chain goes back to straight , and recovers the same energy and outward force that the chain produces on the pinned end atoms as in the straight calculation .",
    "in contrast , above the buckling instability , a curved shape stabilizes , with a net decrease in total energy and in the force acting on the pinned end atoms . crosses in fig .",
    "[ kfit : fig ] report the fixed - end excess energy of the polyynic chain when allowed to relax in a buckled geometry .",
    "we find that the actual buckling instability occurs very close to the linear - response continuum - model value @xmath67 of eq .  .",
    "relaxations near instability are rather delicate , since equilibrium is almost indifferent , providing a manifold of almost - equivalent geometrical configurations which give a hard time to the optimization algorithm .",
    "the present work demonstrates that it is possible to go a long way in describing an immaterialy thin object such as a monoatomic carbon chain with the mechanics of bulk construction elements , not unlike it was done for 2d graphene in refs .  . eventually , carbyne chains turn out rigid enough that the 886  pm - long free - standing c@xmath4 polyyne can sustain a compressive strain of nearly 0.5% before buckling . on the tensile side ,",
    "we extend our calculations well outside the linear - response region , to estimate the ultimate tensile strength of carbynes .",
    "the ultimate tension @xmath68 is computed as the maximum force that the carbyne section produces in sustaining an externally imposed longitudinal strain @xmath69 .",
    "the result in the 10  nn region agrees with previous determinations @xcite ( but disagrees significantly with the tersoff - brenner  model determination of ref .  ) , and indicates that a single molecular chain could be used as a rope to lift a mass as heavy as one microgram without breaking !",
    "if one could pack carbynes with a lateral density of one per @xmath70  nm@xmath58 cross - section , one would obtain a material characterized by a remarkable ultimate tensile strength of the order 300  gpa , comparable to that of carbon nanotubes.@xcite    despite the remarkable mechanical properties of carbynes , their chemical reactivity makes them unsuitable to many applications in real world mechanical situations , where carbon fiber or carbon nanotubes provide superior stability with comparable mechanical properties .",
    "however in clean well - isolated nano - engineered devices one could envisage that the usage of c@xmath3 chains as structural or elastic elements may lead to consistent advantages over traditional solutions .",
    "for example , the soft bending degree of freedom could be exploited for the construction of sensitive accelerometers . indeed , according to our evaluation of @xmath20 , a 0.1  @xmath49 g mass hanging at the end of a 37  nm - long c@xmath71 chain ( with the other end bonded to a fixed substrate )",
    "would deflect laterally by as much as 1  nm under an acceleration of 0.01  ms@xmath72 , i.e.  one thousandth of the earth gravitational field ."
