    "stars provide most of the light we detect in the universe and the entire chemical and dynamical evolution of galaxies is strongly influenced by the formation of many generations of stars .",
    "the most massive ones enrich the surrounding medium of highly processed material and supply vast amounts of kinetic energy ( both with their winds and , even more , with their ultimate explosions as type  ii supernov ) .",
    "lower mass stars constitute one of the main sources of crucial elements , such as carbon and nitrogen ( through stellar winds first , and planetary nebula ejection later ) in their individual evolution , and may be the main suppliers of the iron group elements if , in binary systems , they succeed to merge and explode as type  ia supernov .    a major problem that one encounters almost ubiquitously when studying stars is the effect that interstellar dust has on the observed spectral distribution of their light .",
    "a precise measurement of the interstellar reddening along the line of sight to the stars under study is the first step , and a crucial one , towards determining the intrinsic properties of the stellar populations .",
    "all sky reddening maps , such as the one derived from dust temperature by @xcite , for example , may not be satisfactory for detailed stellar populations studies . for example",
    ", it can not be used in the direction of nearby galaxies , such as the magellanic clouds and m31 .",
    "also , the derived value of the dust column density is extremely sensitive to dust temperature and , in any case , not accurate for high values of extinction ( @xmath0  _ mag _ , * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , the angular resolution of the map is pretty coarse ( @xmath1 , as compared to a few arcseconds for the method presented here ) and , thus , it does not allow to cope effectively with the patchy structure typical of the interstellar medium .",
    "it is certainly preferable to determine the amount of dust in front of the stars from the light coming from the stars themselves .",
    "while spectroscopic data may certainly provide an accurate determination of the reddening and the stellar parameters , the multiplexing capabilities of current spectrographs are limited , at best , to a few tens of ( relatively bright ) objects per telescope pointing .",
    "the method we describe in this paper overcomes this limitation by using only imaging and , thus , providing measurements of both the stellar parameters and the reddening along the line of sight to thousands of stars per pointing .",
    "the gain in terms of statistics is obviously tremendous . as a consequence ,",
    "the spatial resolution of the resulting extinction map is extremely high , with an @xmath2  measurement every few arcseconds , even for moderately dense star fields . while here we test this newly developed technique on _",
    "hst_-_wfpc2 _",
    "observations , the method can be applied to data obtained with any instrument .",
    "the quality of the final result , however , will obviously depend on the quality of the input photometry .",
    "the whole purpose of this paper is to describe a method to retrieve the stellar parameters from this kind of data by fitting model atmospheres to the observed fluxes . in section  [ sec",
    ": data - red ] we describe the dataset considered and the reduction techniques adopted . in section  [ sec : cmd ] the limitations of the classical approach based on color - magnitude diagrams are discussed and the method we have developed to overcome them via a multiband fit to the observed spectra is presented in section  [ sec : proc ] . the results of this procedure are discussed in section  [ sec : fresults ] , while section  [ sec : meth_gte ] deals with the effects that the gravity and metallicity of the input model spectra have on the derived parameters .",
    "finally , the spectral coverage needed to recover bot @xmath3  and @xmath2  is explored in section  [ sec : need ] and the role of random and systematic errors is assessed in section  [ sec : err ] .    the broad band colors in selected _ wfpc2 _  filters and the corresponding extinction coefficients , which are needed for any application of our procedure , are provided in appendix  [ sec : app_colors ] .",
    "our method was developed and tested using _ hst_-_wfpc2 _  multiband observations .",
    "in particular , we have taken advantage of the wealth of information provided by the repeated observations of supernova  1987a ( sn1987a ) and the field surrounding it in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) . since 1994 , supernova  1987a was imaged with the _ wfpc2 _  every year as a part of the * s*upernova * in*tensive * s*tudy project ( sins , pi : robert p. kirshner ) .",
    "the log of the observations we have used is reported in table  [ tab : log ] .",
    "the _ wfpc2 _  filters do not exactly match any of the ground - based photometric systems and the closest analog of the passbands we have used is reported in the last column of this table .",
    "the observations cover an almost circular portion of the sky centered on sn1987a and with a radius of @xmath4 , corresponding to roughly 32  pc at the distance of the lmc . the true color image derived from our data",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : truecolor ] .",
    "the observations were processed through the standard podps ( post observation data processing system ) pipeline for bias removal and flat fielding . in all the cases the available images for each filter were combined to remove cosmic rays events . the long baseline in wavelength that they cover ( more than a factor of 4 , extending from @xmath52,300 to @xmath59,600   ) together with the unprecedented spatial resolution of _ wfpc2 _  ( @xmath6 , _ i.e. _  roughly 0.03  pc at the distance of the lmc ) make of this dataset a unique and ideal one to investigate the problem of disentangling the effects of reddening from those of different effective temperatures for stars of different spectral type .",
    "the plate scale of the camera is 0.045 and 0.099 arcsec / pixel in the pc and in the three wf chips , respectively .",
    "we performed aperture photometry following the prescriptions by @xcite as refined by @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _  measuring the flux in a circular aperture of 2  pixels radius and the sky background value in an annulus of internal radius 3  pixels and width 2  pixels .",
    "aperture photometry is perfectly adequate for our study because crowding is never a problem in our images . actually , the average separation of stars from each other is about 1.3@xmath7  ( _",
    "i.e. _  @xmath8 pixels in the pc chip and @xmath9 pixels in the wf ones ) which is much larger than the _ wfpc2 _  psf width .",
    "we have used the _ iraf - synphot _ synthetic photometry package to compute the theoretical data numbers to be compared to the observed ones .",
    "the _ wfpc2 _  calibration and , consequently , the _ synphot _ results are typically accurate to within @xmath10 5% @xcite .",
    "we identify the stars in the deepest frame ( f555w , _",
    "i.e. _  v band - like filter ) and then measure their magnitudes in all of the other filters",
    ". the total number of stars identified in this way is 21,955 .",
    "if a star is not detected in a band , then its magnitude in that band is substituted by a @xmath11 upper limit . for about 12,340 of them , _",
    "i.e. _  56% , the photometric accuracy is better than 0.1  _ mag _  in the f555w , f675w and f814w filters .",
    "the number of stars with accuracy better than 0.1  _ mag _  drops to 6,825 ( 31% ) in the f439w band , and only 786 ( 3.6% ) stars have an uncertainty in the f255w filter smaller than 0.2  _",
    "mag_.    the brightest stars in each ccd chip are saturated ( _ i.e. _  most stars brighter than 17.5 in the f555w passband ) .",
    "we recover their photometry either by fitting the unsaturated wings of the psf for moderately saturated stars , _ i.e. _  with no saturation outside the central 2 pixel radius , or by following the method developed by @xcite for heavily saturated stars . in most cases ,",
    "the achieved photometric accuracy is better than 0.05 magnitudes .",
    "full description of the methods used can be found in @xcite . as a sanity check",
    "we have compared our photometry in the f439w and f555w bands with ground - based one in b and v ( 28 stars brighter than @xmath12 within 30@xmath7  from sn1987a , * ? ? ? * ) and found an overall excellent agreement , _",
    "i.e. _  _ rms _ deviations less than 0.05  _ mag _  in both filters , except for the obvious cases of few stars that appear as point - like in ground based images but are resolved into more than one object on the _ wfpc2 _  frames .",
    "this result confirms the accuracy of our photometric measurements and the quality of the _ wfpc2 _  calibration .",
    "we shall see in section  [ sec : proc ] that a good photometric quality in different bands is needed in order to recover @xmath2  and stellar temperature . in order to select stars with a good overall photometry",
    "we define the mean error in 5 bands ( @xmath13 ) ( _ i.e. _  excluding the uv f255w band ) as :    @xmath14    in addition to the main field described above , we have also used a second set of _",
    "images pointing @xmath15 south - east of sn1987a .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab : sn87a_parf_log ] in this case we only use 4 filters and the f336w and f439w passbands are substituted with their broader counterparts f300w and f450w , respectively . being broader , the latter are more efficient and allowed us to save precious telescope time , always a crucial issue , without losing any vital information ( see section  [ sec : need ] ) .",
    "as it can be seen in figure  [ fig : truecolor ] supernova  1987a and its rings are right at the center of the field imaged with _",
    "wfpc2 _  and belong to a loose cluster of blue stars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "also , the interstellar medium , as traced by the @xmath16  emission coded in red in figure  [ fig : truecolor ] , is far from being spatially uniform and its distribution varies on scales of few arcseconds ( let us recall here that 1@xmath7  corresponds to roughly 0.25  _ pc _ at the distance of the lmc ) . since the spatial distribution of dust usually follows the one of gas ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , one can expect the interstellar reddening to vary on similar , if not even smaller , scales .",
    "this is further confirmed by an inspection of figure  [ fig : cmd ] where we show the color - magnitude diagrams ( cmd ) for different combination of bands .",
    "the black dots in each cmd in figure  [ fig : cmd ] are the 6,695 stars with @xmath17  _ mag _ , where @xmath13  is the mean error defined in equation  ( [ eq : mer ] ) .",
    "the error threshold of @xmath17 reflects itself as a magnitude threshold at .",
    "we estimate that the completeness at this magnitude limit is very close to 100% because the density of detected stars down to 23th magnitude is rather low , _",
    "i.e. _  about 1 star per 4.6 square - arcsec area @xcite .",
    "it is apparent that , despite the high quality of the measurements ( internal uncertainties less than 0.1 magnitudes , see also figure  [ fig : phot_err ] ) , the various features of the cmds , such as the zero age main sequence for the early type stars and the red giant clump for the more evolved populations , are rather `` fuzzy '' and not sharply defined .",
    "although this is due in part to the presence of several stellar populations projected on each other @xcite , most of the problem arises from the fact that reddening is not quite uniform over the field , thus causing the points of otherwise identical stars to fall in appreciably different locations of the cmds .",
    "the large number of bands available in our dataset provides a sort of _ wide - band spectroscopy _ which defines the continuum spectral distribution of each star quite well .",
    "of course , the resolution is very low , of the order of @xmath18 , but , still , important features , such as the balmer jump between the _ hst _",
    "f336w and f439w bands , are clearly visible . four examples of `` wide band spectra '' are shown in figure  [ fig : wbsp_nfit ] ( the flux f@xmath19 is expressed in units of erg  @xmath20  s@xmath21  @xmath21 ) and their observed magnitudes are listed in table  [ tab : wbsp_nfit ] .",
    "the whole purpose of this paper is to describe a method to retrieve the stellar parameters from this kind of data by fitting model atmospheres to the observed fluxes .",
    "the _ shape _ of the observed spectrum is mostly determined by the effective temperature of the star and by the amount of dust along the line of sight .",
    "the other quantity of interest , namely the solid angle subtended by the star ( or , correspondingly , its angular radius ) is obtained by a straight normalization of the spectral distribution .",
    "the general idea of our method is to recover simultaneously the extinction along the line of sight and the effective temperature of a star by fitting the observed magnitudes to the ones computed using stellar atmosphere models reddened by various amounts of @xmath2 . the angular radius ,",
    "then , is directly obtained from the ratio of the observed flux , dereddened with the best fitting @xmath2  value , to the one at the surface of the star , as given by the best fitting model atmosphere .",
    "thus , the two fundamental ingredients that go into the fit are the _ stellar atmosphere models _ and the _ reddening law _ : we have adopted the models by @xcite and the reddening law by @xcite .    we have chosen the models by @xcite , as they provide a well tested , homogeneous set covering the temperature interval between 3,500 and 50,000  k in the wavelength range between 90     and 160  @xmath22 .",
    "they are computed with an updated version of the ` atlas9 ` code used for the @xcite models with no allowance for convective overshooting , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "we have used the iraf task _ synphot _ to compute the theoretical magnitudes at the surface of the star for the grid of temperatures provided by @xcite by convolving the model spectra with the _ hst_+_wfpc2 _  response curves .",
    "once the convolution is performed , we use a spline interpolation to get a temperature grid with a logarithmic step of 0.005 , _",
    "i.e. _  1% .",
    "we have used model atmospheres with @xmath23 ( cgs units ) , which is the typical value for main sequence stars , and z@xmath24z@xmath25 , the mean expected metallicity of the lmc . in section  [ sec : meth_gte ] we will analyze and discuss the effects of these two parameters on the fit and",
    "we will see that neither of them affects the values of the derived parameters appreciably .    in order to faithfully model the data , we have computed separately the expected counts that a given spectrum produces on each of the four _ wfpc2 _  chip detectors .",
    "also , the throughput variation between decontaminations of the camera @xcite was taken into account by specifying the julian date of the observation ( the _ cont _ keyword in _ synphot _ ) .",
    "details of this procedure can be found in @xcite , while model magnitudes for solar and one third solar metallicity are listed here in tables  ( [ tab : cas22 ] ) and ( [ tab : cas63 ] ) , respectively .",
    "the other input ingredient is the _",
    "reddening law_. this is a combination of foreground extinction due to dust in the milky way and internal extinction in the lmc .",
    "we have taken the first component to be the same for all of the stars , with @xmath26 ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and we have used the galactic reddening law as compiled by @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the amount of extinction from the lmc dust is one of the parameters of the fit .",
    "we have taken the lmc reddening law in the direction of our field to be the one determined by @xcite from a study of an _",
    "ultraviolet and optical spectrum of star  2 , one of the companions to sn1987a projected just 3@xmath7.9 nw of it .",
    "it is , of course , crucially important to use a reddening law derived in the same field under study , as it may vary considerably from place to place on quite small angular scales ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "these reddening laws were used to compute the extinction coefficients in the _",
    "wfpc2_passbands for every combination of input model spectrum and value of @xmath2  ( see table  [ tab : abs ] ) .",
    "the fitting procedure consists of two steps :    * we first use a reddening - free color to determine which stars can be used to measure the reddening unambiguously ; * once this is done , we use the full information from the 6  bands to fit the observed spectral energy distribution for all of the stars .",
    "we will now describe these two steps .",
    "it is a well known fact that the solution in the @xmath2-@xmath3  plane may not be unique for stars later than , roughly speaking , a0 and that different combinations of temperature and reddening may lead to almost indistinguishable optical and near - uv low resolution spectra .",
    "an example is shown in figure  [ fig : etdeg ] where we compare @xcite models for three combinations of temperature and reddening : @xmath27  k and @xmath28 ( short - dash line ) , @xmath29  k reddened by @xmath30 ( long - dash line ) and , finally , @xmath31  k and @xmath32 ( full line ) .",
    "the spectra are normalized to the f814w flux and errorbars corresponding to 0.1  _ mag _  are shown . to all practical purposes",
    "the spectra are identical for wavelengths longer than 3,300    and only good data in the ultraviolet can help to distinguish them .",
    "unfortunately , though , these data are often not available , as imaging in the ultraviolet can only be done from space and it requires very long exposure times for red stars . the purpose of first step of the procedure , then , is to use a reddening - free color to eliminate the @xmath2-@xmath3  degeneracy when no ultraviolet observations are available .",
    "let us consider the reddening - free color @xmath33 , combination of the magnitudes in the u , b and i passbands ( _ e.g. , _   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) :    @xmath34    @xmath33  is reddening - free in the sense that :    @xmath35 \\simeq q_{\\mathrm{ubi},0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the subscript `` 0 '' indicates the unreddened quantities .",
    "@xmath33  is not exactly equal to @xmath36 because the coefficient in equation  ( [ eq : meth_qubi ] ) is not a constant , but depends on the temperature of the star and on the amount of reddening in front of it ( see appendix  [ sec : app_colors ] ) . with the reddening law of @xcite , and using the _ wfpc2 _  filters f336w ( u ) , f439w ( b ) and f814w ( i ) , one finds @xmath37 for @xmath38 and this is the value will use .",
    "the reddening - free color @xmath33  computed with the models by @xcite for the wfpc2 filters is plotted in figure  [ fig : qubit ] versus @xmath39 .",
    "the curve is for @xmath28 and the arrow is the reddening vector for @xmath40  _",
    "mag_.    since , by construction , the value of @xmath33  does not change with @xmath2 , the effect of reddening in the @xmath33  vs  @xmath39 plane is to move the points _ horizontally _ to the _ right _ from the zero - reddening locus , as indicated by the arrow in figure  [ fig : qubit ] .",
    "moreover , @xmath41 , the horizontal distance of an observed point from the theoretical zero - reddening curve , is proportional to @xmath2 :    @xmath42    whereas the observed @xmath33  is , to first approximation , a function only of the star s temperature ( see figure  [ fig : qubit ] ) .    as apparent from figure  [ fig : qubit ] @xmath33  is not a monotonic function of f336w@xmath43f814w , _ i.e. _  temperature , but it is w - shapedf814w@xmath44 is caused by the _",
    "wfpc2_2f336w filter red leak . ] .",
    "this , in turn , is due to the non monotonicity of the balmer jump , the intensity of which peaks for a0 stars and declines both for earlier and later spectral types ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "so , stars in region _ a _ on figure  [ fig : qubit ] have only one possible intersection with the zero reddening curve and for them the solution @xmath3-@xmath2  is unique . in the case of stars in region",
    "@xmath45 , there are three intersections with the reddening curve , but the two on the right are easily rejected by noticing that , according to equation  ( [ eq : meth_dui ] ) , they correspond to negative values of @xmath2  and , hence , are not acceptable .",
    "the solution , therefore , even if not unique , is unambiguous .",
    "things are more complicated for the stars with f336w@xmath43f814w@xmath46 , _ i.e. _  @xmath47  k. here , the solution is not only non - unique , but also ambiguous . as a matter of fact",
    ", there are two ( region @xmath48 ) or three ( region @xmath49 ) combinations of @xmath3  and @xmath2  that are absolutely equivalent .",
    "all of these solutions are physical and there is no a priori criterion the decide which one is the right one .    * the first step of the procedure is to divide the stars in four classes , according to their photometric error and the number of solutions in the @xmath50 plane . * in other words , they are classified according to the mean error in five bands @xmath13   introduced in equation  ( [ eq : mer ] ) and to the number of intersections that they have _ to their left _ , _ i.e. _  bluer f336w@xmath43f814w color , with the theoretical zero - reddening curve in the @xmath33  vs.  f336w@xmath43f814w plane . in order to account for the photometric errors , we project the measured value plus or minus its error . in the following",
    ", a star belongs to a certain class if the measured point _ and",
    "_ the  @xmath51 values have the _ same _ number of intersections .",
    "the classes are defined as :    class i : : :    stars that have only one intersection to their left .",
    "they are the    stars in region @xmath52 and @xmath45 in    figure  [ fig : qubit ] ; class ii : : :    stars in region @xmath48 in figure  [ fig : qubit ] .",
    "they have two    intersections to their left .",
    "the solution for    @xmath2  and    @xmath3  is not unique and we shall see shortly    how we choose between the different possibilities ; class iii : : :    stars that , in spite of their good photometry    ( @xmath17 ) , have a    `` problematic '' location in the    @xmath33  vs.  f336w@xmath43f814w plane .",
    "these are :    +    * stars whose horizontal projection never intersects the    zero - reddening curve to their left ;    * stars that belong to region @xmath49 figure  [ fig : qubit ] and ,    hence , have three intersections to their left .",
    "as we shall discuss in    section  [ sec : meth_gte ] , in this region the particular combination of    colors we have chosen is sensitive to metallicity and this    classification scheme is not reliable ;    * stars that fall above the peak at    f336w@xmath43f814w@xmath53 , roughly along the long - dash    line in figure  [ fig : qubit ] , for which the f336w flux is too strong as    compared to the one in the other bands . as discussed in @xcite , they    are uv excess objects , most likely t  tauri stars and the u - band excess    is due to the presence of a circumstellar disk accreting onto the    star . as a consequence ,",
    "their spectrum is not well modeled by the one    of a normal photosphere and no reliable    @xmath2  can be derived by comparing    their colors to those of a normal photosphere .",
    "class iv : : :    finally , stars with poor overall photometry , _",
    "i.e. _",
    "@xmath54 , are assigned to    this class , independent of the number of intersections .",
    "as an example , the result of the division into classes is shown in figure  [ fig : qubi_cl ] for the wf3 chip of the july  1997 observations .",
    "class  i stars are hotter than about 10,000  k , whereas class  ii stars are between 6,750 and 8,500  k. in the particular case we are discussing here , out of a total number of 3,139 stars , 40 belong to class  i ( 1.3% ) , 388 to class  ii ( 12.4% ) and 615 to class  iii ( 19.6% ) .",
    "the rest of them ( 2096 or 66.8% ) belong to class iv .",
    "again , for every star the measured @xmath33  gives a first order estimate of the temperature , see figure  [ fig : qubit ] , and the excess in @xmath55 gives a first order estimate of @xmath2  from equation  ( [ eq : meth_dui ] ) .",
    "these are , then , used as an input in the second step of the procedure , the 6-band fit , which we will now describe .",
    "in the first step we have used only a subset of the 6 bands available .",
    "now that the number of possible solutions in the @xmath3-@xmath2  plane is assessed for every star , we can proceed to fit the entire spectrum at once with a @xmath56 technique using the information gathered in the first step as a starting point for the fit :    class i : : :    the fit is performed in a neighborhood of @xmath57  _ mag _    around the @xmath2  value deducted from    the projection in the    @xmath33  vs.  f336w@xmath43f814w plane ; class ii : : :    we choose the smallest of the two    @xmath2  values from the projection    described above as the starting point and perform the fit in a    neighborhood around it , defined as to avoid the other possible    solutions .",
    "this is somewhat arbitrary , but an inspection of    figure  [ fig : qubi_cl ] , for example , does not indicate any compelling    evidence for a large number of stars with extinction much larger than    the mean value . let us stress here that the reddening is still    computed individually for each star ; class iii and iv : : :    for the various reasons mentioned above , photometry is not reliable    enough to allow to solve for all of the three unknowns simultaneously    and the reddening is derived from class  i and ii stars .",
    "we have    explored two options : either using the mean value of the 4 closest    class  i and ii neighbors or the mean over the entire field . in the    case of the field of sn1987a",
    "the result is the same , as the extinction    does not show any significant spatial pattern and the local mean is    mostly equal to the general one .",
    "however , when the reddening shows    appreciable small scale correlations , however , the local mean does    give better results , most notably a narrower main sequence , and the    first option should be preferred ( see , for example , the case of    ngc  6822 in * ? ? ?",
    "the details of the @xmath56 fit are described in appendix  [ sec : app_fit ] . while in the selection process we have used constant extinction coefficients to build @xmath33  ( see equation  ( [ eq : meth_qubi ] ) ) , in the 6-band fit they vary according to the @xmath3  and @xmath2  values ( see table  [ tab : abs ] in appendix  [ sec : app_colors ] ) .",
    "this procedure assures total control over the fitting process .",
    "in fact , even in the case of multiple intersections , it provides a criterion to choose the most reasonable solution .",
    "once this is done , the 6  band fit uses all of the information available and , thus , gives the best possible answer .",
    "moreover , the whole procedure is very efficient in terms of computer cpu time usage , since it limits the size of the grid in the 6  band fit , which is the most time - consuming part of it all , only to a small region in the parameter space around the physical minimum in the @xmath3-@xmath2  plane .",
    "as an example of the results of the procedure , in figure  [ fig : wbsp_fit ] we show the spectra of the same four stars of figure  [ fig : wbsp_nfit ] together with the best fitting models . the derived parameters and their errors are listed in table  [ tab : wbsp_fit ] .",
    "the hr diagram for the 21,955 stars in the field of sn1987a is displayed in figure  [ fig : sn87a_hrms ] .",
    "it is interesting to compare it to what one would have obtained from a `` blind '' fit of the spectrum , _ i.e. _  by skipping the selection described in section  [ sec : redfree ] and performing directly the 6-band fit of section  [ sec : fit ] .",
    "this is shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : blind ] .",
    "the fit for the stars marked in grey in the left panel of figure  [ fig : blind ] is obviously wrong as they occupy an impossible region of the hr diagram .",
    "an inspection of the right panel of the same figure reveals that all of these stars , and only them , were fitted with too high a value of @xmath2  and , consequently , of @xmath3 . these are all stars that fall in regions @xmath48 or @xmath49 in figure  [ fig : qubit ] for which the broad band spectrum can be interpreted either as a heavily reddened hot star or as a cold one with little dust in front of it .",
    "the fit just selects the solution with the lowest @xmath56 , even if it is marginally lower than other possible minima . which one of the possible solution has the lowest @xmath56 depends on such things as the @xmath2  and @xmath3  grids used in the fit and , in the case shown in figure  [ fig : blind ] , the wrong one is chosen for two stars out of three .",
    "for many of these stars the available photometry is limited to f439w and redder filters . as we will see in section  [ sec : need ] , then , the data are very little sensitive to temperature and these cold stars can be mistaken for objects as hot as 50,000  k.    on the other hand , selecting the right solution _ before _ performing the fit eliminates the problem almost completely .",
    "there still are roughly 600 stars ( less than 3% of the total ) under the zero age main sequence locus .",
    "however , they are mostly class iv objects , _ i.e. _  stars with very poor photometry , or stars with peculiar colors , _",
    "i.e. _  the t  tauri stars described in detail by @xcite or unresolved binaries .",
    "the stars with multiple solutions are the late - type ones .",
    "being able to measure _ directly _ the reddening for them is important for two reasons .",
    "firstly , as low mass stars are much more numerous than higher mass ones , the number of reddening determinations increases dramatically .",
    "in fact the late type stars for which eventually we are able to measure the reddening are typically a factor of 10 more numerous than those earlier that a0 .",
    "secondly , stars of different masses have different lifetimes and there is no a priori reason why different generations of stars should be affected by the same amount of extinction ( see * ? ? ? * for an example in the lmc itself ) . by extending our analysis to a wide range of masses",
    "we can check for population - dependent effects and deredden the different generations of stars in the most appropriate way .",
    "in addition to measuring the intrinsic properties of the stars shown in figure  [ fig : sn87a_hrms ] , our procedure also provides individual @xmath2measurements for more than 2,500 stars , on average one every 13 square arcseconds .",
    "the resulting histogram and spatial distribution of interstellar reddening are shown in figure  [ fig : sn87a_ebv ] ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "as it can be seen , the initial suspicion is confirmed and the reddening is indeed very patchy and varies on scales of a few arcseconds .",
    "besides providing a very accurate reddening map , measuring individual values of @xmath2  also leads to a narrowing of the various features in the color - magnitude diagram , in particular the main sequence .",
    "this is of great help when interpreting the data , because it allows one to disentangle the broadening due to differential extinction from the one caused , for example , by the overlap of several generations of stars or by the presence of binary stars .    in figure",
    "[ fig : beaft_bihall ] we compare the stars in the f439w  vs  ( f439w@xmath43f814 ) diagram before and after reddening correction .",
    "the density contours in panels  ( a ) and  ( b ) are spaced by factors of 2 .",
    "apart from the obvious fact that the corrected stars are bluer and more luminous , it is apparent that the features in the reddening corrected diagram are narrower than the corresponding ones in the observed cmd . in order to quantify this effect",
    "let us consider a color cut through the main sequence , like the one displayed in panel  ( c ) of figure  [ fig : beaft_bihall ] ( see also figure  [ fig : beaft_msh ] ) .",
    "here , the blue line histogram represents the color distribution of the dereddened main sequence stars with @xmath17 in the @xmath58m(f439w)@xmath59 magnitude interval .",
    "the red line histogram gives the distribution of the same stars before reddening correction . to facilitate the comparison ,",
    "this latter is shifted in color so as to have the same mode as the dereddened one .",
    "as apparent , the original distribution is definitely more spread out in color : its rms is 24% larger than the corrected one ( 0.21  _ mag_versus 0.17 ) .",
    "this is the case all along the main sequence , as shown in figure  [ fig : beaft_msh ] , where we plot the color distribution for all the stars with @xmath17 in different magnitude bins .",
    "the dereddened histograms ( blue line ) always display a smaller scatter than the observed ones ( red line ) , confirming the effectiveness of the correction procedure .",
    "as it can be expected , the color distribution is even narrower when only the stars with individual reddening determinations , _",
    "i.e. _  those we have classified as class  i and ii , are considered .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : beaft_bihind ] . in this case",
    "the rms of the reddening - corrected main sequence histogram , again in the @xmath58m(f439w)@xmath59 magnitude interval , is 0.14  _ mag _ , while the one of the same stars before correction is 0.18  _ mag _ , _ i.e. _  29% larger .",
    "a simple kolmogorov - smirnov test shows that the widths of the two distributions are different at the 99.9995% level .    to conclude ,",
    "let us remark again that class  iii and iv stars were not corrected with and individually determined value of @xmath2 , but , rather , with the mean value from 2,510 class  i and ii neighbors .",
    "it is important to realize that , given the large number of these stars , the mean reddening used to correct class  iii and iv stars is on average very accurate .",
    "of course , it is still possible that a few class iii and iv stars have , in reality , extinction values significantly different from their local mean , but the global effect is negligible .",
    "the full discussion of the stellar content of the region around sn1987a can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "so far we have used model atmospheres only with one surface gravity ( @xmath23 , appropriate for main sequence stars ) and metallicity ( z@xmath60 , the expected mean value for the lmc ) .",
    "even though these are sensible assumptions for the environment under study , we have to verify their influence on the results we derive .",
    "let us start by considering the surface gravity .",
    "the theoretical zero - reddening locus in the @xmath33  vs.  f336w@xmath43f814w plane is shown in figure  [ fig : meth_qubig ] for three values of surface gravity , namely @xmath61 ( dotted line ) , 4.5 ( solid line ) and 5 ( dashed line ) .",
    "as it can be seen , the three curves overlap perfectly for f336w@xmath43f814w@xmath62 , _ i.e. _  @xmath63  k and f336w@xmath43f814w@xmath64 , _ i.e. _  @xmath65  k. elsewhere , however , different surface gravities lead to different expected zero - reddening loci in the @xmath33  vs.  f336w@xmath43f814w diagram . in particular , this influences the division in classes that is the foundation of the method described above .    however , as it can be seen , for example , in figure  [ fig : beaft_bihind ] , only stars on or near the main sequence are used to determine the reddening . adopting the stellar evolutionary models by @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we see that for z@xmath60 the gravity is nearly constant along the main sequence and that its value is @xmath23 , the value we have used in the fit .",
    "this is a sound assumption over a large range of metallicities because extensive model calculations show that surface gravity variations as a function of chemical composition are quite small .",
    "for example , at @xmath66 the surface gravity ranges from @xmath67 for a solar metallicity star to @xmath68 for z = z@xmath69 . considering that for every metallicity the gravity is almost constant along the main sequence one can safely adopt the value of @xmath23 , independent of chemical composition .",
    "once a star evolves off the main sequence its surface gravity changes appreciably .",
    "for example , @xmath70 is a typical value for the stars in the red giant clump , _",
    "i.e. _  the stars at @xmath71 and @xmath72 in figure  [ fig : sn87a_hrms ] .",
    "even though the @xmath33  vs.  f336w@xmath43f814w relation is , indeed , sensitive to gravity , the result of our global fit is not .",
    "this is because , as we have seen , we do not fit simultaneously temperature and reddening for stars off the main sequence , but rather we assign to them the mean @xmath2  value of their class i and ii neighbors , which are on the main sequence and , hence , have @xmath73 . for stars that are off the main sequence ,",
    "we just perform the fit to solve for the radius and effective temperature .",
    "once the reddening is correctly determined , the result of the multi - band fit is no longer sensitive to the surface gravity adopted in computing the theoretical colors .",
    "we have checked this by dividing the stars into classes using the @xmath33  vs.  @xmath74 relation for @xmath23 , and then fitting the stars with colors computed for various values of the gravity .",
    "the maximum variations in temperature for the stars on the red giant branch are of 3% , _",
    "i.e. _  much smaller than the error deriving from the fit itself , and with no systematic trend with gravity . given this result ,",
    "we have decided to use @xmath23 all throughout our analysis .",
    "in addition to influencing the stellar structure , the chemical composition also plays a role in determining the star s spectrum , through the atmospheric opacity . as a consequence",
    ", the colors also depend on this parameter .",
    "the @xmath33  vs.  @xmath74 relation for different values of z is shown in figure  [ fig : meth_qubiz ] . again , as it can be seen , the variations are negligible for the stars for which the reddening is an individual fit parameter ,",
    "_ i.e. _  class i and ii stars .",
    "also in this case , then , once the subdivision into classes is made and the local mean reddening for class iii and iv stars is determined from the individual values of class i and ii neighbors , the result of the multi - band fit is insensitive to the details of the stellar atmospheres .",
    "the comparison of the fits performed with colors computed for different metallicities shows that the derived parameters do not depend appreciably on metallicity .",
    "we conclude that in applying our fitting procedure , as described in section  [ sec : proc ] , one can safely use colors computed with models by @xcite for z@xmath60 and @xmath23 to derive accurate stellar parameters and interstellar absorptions for all stars .",
    "for every star there are three unknown quantities : the angular radius , the effective temperature and the reddening . therefore ,",
    "for each star one needs at least data in three bands to make the problem mathematically well defined . for good results the measurements in those three bands",
    "must also be rather accurate , thus requiring that the bands be selected so as to fall around the wavelength of the maximum of the spectral distribution of any given star , and have a suitable wavelength spacing to assure a sufficient baseline for the spectral shape analysis . in practice",
    "this is achieved with bands separated from each other by about 30 - 40% of their central wavelengths . moreover , when dealing with a _",
    "stellar population _",
    "one wants to study stars within a wide range of temperatures , and , therefore , more than three bands are absolutely needed . in this section",
    "we will investigate how many and which bands are needed to constrain the fit .",
    "let us start by noticing that a u - like band is mandatory to recover both @xmath3   and @xmath2 . to illustrate this point",
    "let us define the reddening - free color @xmath75 combination of b , v and i. by analogy with equation  ( [ eq : meth_qubi ] ) :    @xmath76    @xmath77 is shown in figure  [ fig : qbvi_bb ] as a function of @xmath78 in panel  ( a ) and @xmath3  in panel  ( b ) .    since the the b , v and i filters do not include the balmer jump , the relation between @xmath75 and b@xmath79 is monotonic , thus solving the problem of ambiguities in the solution .",
    "however , one immediately notices that the slope of the curve is much shallower than in the @xmath33  case .",
    "in fact , the total excursion of @xmath77 between 3,500 and 50,000  k is only 0.4  _ mag _  and it is almost totally insensitive to temperatures higher than 6,000  k , _",
    "i.e. _  @xmath80 .",
    "the combined effect of the weak dependence of @xmath77 on temperature and of photometric errors is to make every combination @xmath2-@xmath3  along the reddening vector essentially equivalent .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : mchi_i ] and figure  [ fig : mchi_ii ] where @xmath56 maps of the fit using only four bands ( f439w , f555w , f675w , and f814w , left panel ) are compared to those using all six of them ( right panel ) .",
    "as it can be seen , when only 4 bands are used the @xmath56 has no distinct minima , and , hence , it is not possible to determine both the reddening and the temperature neither for hot stars for which the solution is unambiguous ( figure  [ fig : mchi_i ] ) nor for the cold ones with multiple minima ( figure  [ fig : mchi_ii ] ) .    also , let us notice here that , while observations at wavelengths shorter than the balmer jump are mandatory to recover both @xmath3  and @xmath2 , it is preferable not to go too far in the ultraviolet , unless one can afford to make observations in more than _ one _ uv band .",
    "qualitatively , the reason for this is that shorter wavelengths are more affected by interstellar reddening and small differences in @xmath2  along different lines of sight may result in large differences in the observed flux , thus making the ultraviolet flux of a moderately reddened hot star almost indistinguishable from the one of an unreddened , colder one .",
    "quantitatively , the situation is illustrated in figure  [ fig : fit - uv ] , where we plot the @xmath81 contour levels for artificial stars of different effective temperature as observed through 4 optical filters ( f439w , f555w , f675w and f814w ) and one uv one : f170w ( dot - dashed line ) , f255w ( dashed line ) or f336w ( full line ) .",
    "the contours , computed assuming the same photometric error in all 3 uv filters , overlap almost perfectly .",
    "this means that one does not gain in accuracy by observing at shorter wavelengths , even for hot stars . since the sensitivity of normal ccds and the emission of cold stars both drop",
    "dramatically the further one moves to the ultraviolet , a filter in the region of the u band is the ideal choice for the filter bluer of the balmer jump .    as we have pointed out at the beginning of this section , there are 3 unknowns in the fit so that 6 bands are actually redundant and 4 could be enough to cover the wide range of temperatures spanned by stars in regions with mixed stellar populations .",
    "in fact , the method works rather well also with only 4 bands , provided that they encompass the balmer jump .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : sn87a_parf_hr ] , where the hr diagram for the control field located @xmath15 south - east of sn1987a , derived following our procedure , is shown . in this case , as reported in table  [ tab : sn87a_parf_log ] , the four available photometric bands were f300w , f450w , f675w and f814w .",
    "the star symbol shows the location of the brightest star in the _ wfpc2 _",
    "field of view .",
    "it is so heavily saturated in the _ wfpc2 _",
    "chip that its image was spilling over several neighboring stars thus making impossible to make direct measurements , and , therefore , its photometry is taken from @xcite .",
    "as it can be seen , the observed main sequence , although still in very good agreement with the theoretical one , is less sharply defined than the one in the field of sn1987a ( see figure  [ fig : sn87a_hrms ] ) and more stars fall under the theoretical zams . using a reduced set of filters has affected the result in two ways .",
    "firstly , there is only one band blueward of the balmer jump ( f300w ) instead of two ( f255w and f336w ) : the fit is less sensitive to temperature for hot stars and , hence , for them , the results are less accurate .",
    "secondly , since the observations were taken as  parallels \" to fos primaries , we did not have enough time to make observations both in the f555w , or a similar band like f606w , and in the f675w filter .",
    "we opted for this latter one to identify stars with @xmath16  emission more accurately .",
    "as a result , though , the photometric points are not spaced in wavelength quite evenly . as a consequence ,",
    "the fit for the cooler stars , the ones that are not well exposed in f300w and f450w bands , has to rely on a short wavelength baseline and , thus , is less precise than it would have been if observations at roughly 5000    had been available .",
    "this also results in a larger fraction of stars below the main sequence ( roughly 600 out of a total of nearly 13,100 , _",
    "i.e. _  4.6% ) when compared to the main field ( roughly 600 out of almost 22,000 , _",
    "i.e. _  less than 3% ) . _ in general",
    ", however , the resulting stellar parameters are still of very good quality _ , with more than 30% of the stars with an error in @xmath3smaller than 10% .",
    "in order to assess the intrinsic precision of the procedure described in this paper we have tested it on simulations .",
    "artificial stars were created with @xmath40 in the 6 filters listed in table  [ tab : log ] , evenly distributed in the logarithm of effective temperature between 3,500 and 50,000  k , the range covered by @xcite models .",
    "they were , then , fitted according to the prescriptions of section  [ sec : proc ] .",
    "the effects of random errors were mimicked by creating three groups of 10,000 stars and adding to the model magnitudes errors drawn from gaussians of different rms ( 0.02 , 0.05 and 0.1  _ mag _ ) .",
    "these stars were then fitted using only 4 , 5 or the complete set of 6 bands .",
    "the situation for a five - band fit ( f336w , f439w , f555w , f675w and f814w ) and varying the photometric precision is shown in figure  [ fig : tout_tin - err ] . there",
    "we plot the ratio of the output to input temperature as a function of the input temperature for different values of the error rms : 0.1  _ mag _  in panel  ( a ) , 0.05  _ mag _  in panel  ( b ) and 0.02  _ mag _  in panel  ( c ) . in each panel",
    "the photometric errors were drawn from the same gaussian , independent of the star s temperature .",
    "as it can be seen , there is no systematic trend and the points are mostly scattered around @xmath82 .",
    "the values of the mean and the dispersion are reported in table  [ tab : rand_err ] .",
    "the biggest deviation from the random scatter is represented by the two features at @xmath83 , which are most prominent in panel  ( c ) .",
    "these are stars close to the turning point at @xmath84 in figure  [ fig : qubit ] and were assigned the wrong value of @xmath2  during the selection process which constitutes the first step of the procedure .",
    "note that this effect depends on the input photometric error because the class assignment is based on it . in the worst case ,",
    "when the error is 0.02  _ mag _ , however , this systematics affects less than 10% of the stars at that temperature , split almost evenly between stars with too high and too low output temperature .",
    "this effect is negligible for studies of stellar populations .",
    "however if one is dealing with special categories of objects , for example variable or otherwise peculiar stars , which represent a small fraction of the total population in the @xmath85 range one should be aware that random errors may create false outliers with temperatures deviating as much as 20% for up 10% of the stars in this temperature range .",
    "for this type of studies it is safer not to determine extinction for individual stars but , rather , to adopt the value of the neighbors not affected by this problem .",
    "it is interesting to notice in all of the panels in figure  [ fig : tout_tin - err ] that the dispersion increases for hotter stars .",
    "this is because broad band colors become progressively more insensitive to temperature as it increases .",
    "in fact , the scatter at high temperatures becomes smaller when the f255w filter is added to the fit , as shown in figure  [ fig : tout_tin - nbands ] .",
    "of course , in reality hotter main sequence stars are also brighter than colder ones and , thus , have smaller photometric error which compensate for the lower sensitivity of colors to high effective temperatures .",
    "again , see table  [ tab : rand_err ] for the values of the mean and dispersion .",
    "in addition to random errors that vary from star to star and from band to band the measured fluxes are also affected by systematic errors in the calibrations of each band , _",
    "i.e. _  errors in the photometric zeropoints .",
    "these , of course , are different from band to band , but the same for all the stars in each band .",
    "again , we have explored three cases ( 0.02 , 0.05 and 0.1  _ mag _ ) and the results are shown in figure  [ fig : syst_hist ] that displays the distributions of the temperature deviations @xmath86 for four representative temperatures , _ i.e. _  5,000 , 10,000 , 20,000 and 40,000  k.    from an inspection of figure  [ fig : syst_hist ] one notices again that , given the same error , the temperature measured for hot stars is intrinsically more uncertain than for cold ones , with the dispersion growing from less than 1% for stars at 5000  k , to as much as 12% at 40,000  k. the sharp peak at @xmath87 found for @xmath88  k ( figure  [ fig : syst_hist ] , panel  ( d ) ) is populated by stars for which the fit , starting from @xmath88  k , would indicate a temperature higher than 50,000  k , the highest in the @xcite grid . even though the peak is just an artifact ,",
    "it is clear that calibration errors much smaller than 0.1  _ mag _  are necessary for the data to be useful at all temperatures .",
    "in this paper we have presented and discussed a new technique that uses multiband photometry to measure reddening , effective temperature and , given the distance , bolometric luminosity for resolved stars .",
    "the method is based on broad band optical and near ultraviolet photometry and , in the test case presented here for the field around sn1987a in the large magellanic cloud , yields to a reddening determination every 13  square arcseconds : a fine grid indeed !",
    "being able to measure the reddening to thousands of individual stars is of great importance in all the astrophysical environments in which the interstellar medium is clumpy and , therefore , produces differential reddening , as is the case , for example , of virtually every star forming region .",
    "there are 3 unknown quantities in the fit : the radius , the effective temperature and the reddening .",
    "formally , then , at least three photometric points are required for each star to make the problem well defined , and more are needed when dealing with stellar population encompassing a wide range of temperatures .",
    "obviously , the more bands are available , the better the result of the fit .",
    "as we have discussed thoroughly , at least one of the bands has to fall at wavelengths shorter than the balmer jump because the optical fluxes alone are not enough to reliably recover both @xmath3  and @xmath2 . on the other hand ,",
    "though , in the case in which observing time constraints limit to one the the number of bands that can be used for uv observations , it is not necessary nor advisable to resort to bands at extremely short wavelengths , and observing just blueward of the balmer jump , a u - like band , is the best choice .",
    "of course , observing in more than one ultraviolet band can only help in reducing the errors on the derived quantities .",
    "although we have used the _ wfpc2 _",
    "counterparts to the classical johnson - cousin passbands to illustrate our method , it proved to work almost equally well when broader filters were used .",
    "broader filters means more photons detected per unit time and , ultimately , a more efficient use of the telescope time at one s disposal .",
    "once the stars are accurately placed in the hertzprung - russel diagram , the physical properties of the stellar population , such as star formation history , mass function etc , can be studied in detail . in this respect ,",
    "let us stress again the importance of determining the reddening from the same stars which are the ultimate target of the investigation , without having to resort to uncontrollable assumptions on the magnitude and distribution of the interstellar extinction .    to conclude , we refer the reader to @xcite for a discussion of the properties of the young stellar population in the field around sn1987a and to @xcite for an application of the dereddend color - magnitude diagram to measuring the distance to the large magellanic cloud",

    "as repeatedly stated , the general idea of our method is to recover simultaneously the extinction along the line of sight and the effective temperature of a star by fitting the observed magnitudes to the ones computed using stellar atmosphere models reddened by various amounts of @xmath2 . in this appendix",
    "we describe the details of the fitting procedure .    among the three parameters we want to determine , only two change the _ shape _ of the spectrum , _ i.e. _  @xmath2  and effective temperature ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the third one , _",
    "i.e. _  the radius @xmath89 , causes just a rigid shift of the flux on a logarithmic scale .",
    "so , we first determine the shape of the spectrum by solving simultaneously for @xmath2  and @xmath3 , then we compute the radius of the star . for every star ,",
    "the following steps are performed :    1 .",
    "the input spectrum is normalized to the band with the highest photometric accuracy , usually the f555w , to eliminate the overall normalization , which depends an the star s radius . obviously , the theoretical spectra are normalized in the same way .",
    "let @xmath90 be the normalized observed magnitude in filter @xmath91 and @xmath92 the normalized model magnitude for temperature @xmath93 in the same filter ; 2 .",
    "the theoretical magnitudes are reddened , for various values of @xmath2 .",

    "the extinction coefficients for selected wfpc2 filters are listed in table  [ tab : abs ] ; 3 .   for",

    "if a star is not detected in a certain band , typically in the uv , a @xmath11 upper limit for the flux is used .",

    ". since the theoretical fluxes are flux densities at the _ surface of the star _ , the angular radius @xmath104 derived from band @xmath91 is : + @xmath105 + where @xmath106 is the magnitude in filter @xmath91 of the best - fitting theoretical spectrum and @xmath107 is the observed magnitude , dereddened with the the best - fitting value of @xmath2 .",
    "the best estimate of the angular radius @xmath104 , then , is : + @xmath108 + where @xmath109 is the number of bands with actual flux measurements .",
    "the associated error @xmath110 , then , is : + @xmath111 + to convert the angular radius of a star to the linear one ( @xmath89 ) , it is necessary to know its distance @xmath49 : + @xmath112 + in this case , @xmath89 is expressed in units of the solar radius r@xmath25 .",
    "+ given the uncertainty on the distance , the error on the linear radius ( @xmath113 ) is : + @xmath114 + this error does not take into account any intrinsic dispersion in the distance of individual stars , which may introduce additional scattering in the hr diagram .",
    "+ for example , in the case of the lmc , we have adopted the value originally measured purely geometrically by @xcite and later improved by @xcite . using the rings around sn1987a , they found @xmath115  kpc ; 6 .   finally , the intrinsic luminosity ( l ) can be computed according to the black body law : + @xmath116 + where @xmath117 is the temperature of the sun . +",
    "since the errors in temperature and radius are correlated , the error on the luminosity can not be computed in a straightforward way from the previous equation .",
    "it is more convenient to write the luminosity in another , completely equivalent form .",
    "let us first define the quantities : + @xmath118 + _ i.e. _  the observed flux in filter @xmath91 , and : + @xmath119 + where @xmath120 is the flux in filter @xmath91 of the best - fitting model .",
    "the quantity @xmath121 is the equivalent of the bolometric correction , relating the total flux in @xmath109  bands to the bolometric luminosity per unit surface @xmath122 .",
    "we can now write the luminosity as : + @xmath123 + where @xmath124 .",

    "+ let us stress once again that the stars may not be all at the same distance and that this may introduce additional scattering in luminosity . from photometry alone",
    ", distances can be measured only in a statistical sense for an entire population and not for individual stars . however , since the intrinsic depth the lmc is estimated to be smaller than 600  pc @xcite , this uncertainty is negligible .",
    "the _ wfpc2 _  is equipped with a large set of broad , medium and narrow band filters for imaging ( see * ? ? ? * for a complete list and full details ) .",
    "some of them closely match filters in the standard johnson - cousin ( e.g. the f555w and the v , the f439w and the b , etc ) or strmgren ( e.g. the f410 m and the _ v _ , the f467 m and the _ b _ , etc ) systems , while some other have no direct counterpart in any standard ground - based set , _",
    "e.g. , _  the f450w and f606w , just to name two , or , obviously , all ultraviolet passbands .",
    "color transformations have been devised to convert the _",
    "wfpc2_magnitudes into the corresponding ones in the johnson - cousin system , but , they are limited to only a handful of passbands .",
    "moreover , quoting directly from @xcite , they `` should be used with caution for quantitative work '' , because they are just first order approximations and unavoidably degrade the quality of the original photometry .",
    "a much better option , when comparing _ wfpc2",
    "_  photometry to theoretical expectations , is to compute these latter ones directly in the passbands used in the observations . as explained in section  [ sec : proc ] , this is what we have done in this paper , thus minimizing the uncertainties in the comparison between the observed _ wfpc2 _  magnitudes and the synthetic ones computed using the @xcite models .    in tables",
    "[ tab : cas22 ] and  [ tab : cas63 ] we list the magnitudes in widely used _",
    "passbands for solar metallicity and for [ fe / h]@xmath130 , the appropriate value for the lmc , respectively .",
    "they were computed using the _ iraf - synphot _ synthetic photometry package and , for the sake of generality , the magnitudes in the ultraviolet filters are referred to the decontaminated camera .",
    "the throughput degradation due to the accumulation of material between decontamination can be easily computed with the formul  given in @xcite .",
    "the magnitudes are for a 1  r@xmath25 star as seen from a distance of 10  pc and scaling them for any radius and distance using equation  ( [ eq : redmag ] ) is straightforward .",
    "the other important quantities that one needs in order to interpret the data are the extinction coefficients .",
    "again , it is very important to compute them in the very same passbands used for the observations .",
    "the values of the normalized extinction @xmath131 for the filters of tables  [ tab : cas22 ] and  [ tab : cas63 ] computed for the galactic reddening law as compiled by @xcite and the models atmospheres by @xcite are listed in table  [ tab : abs ] for various values of the effective temperature and the color excess @xmath2 .    using the entries of tables  [ tab : cas22 ] , [ tab : cas63 ] and [ tab : abs ] , then",
    ", it is very easy to model a star of metallicity z , surface gravity @xmath132 , effective temperature @xmath3 , radius @xmath89 ( in solar units ) as seen at a distance @xmath49 ( in parsecs ) through a layer of dust characterized by a reddening @xmath2 :        ultraviolet _ wfpc2 _",
    "filters are notoriously affected by red leak , and a quite substantial one when red stars are observed ( see table 3.13 of * ? ? ?",
    "this is the reason why , for example , as shown in table  [ tab : abs ] , the extinction coefficient @xmath136 in the f170w filter is about 4 times smaller for a @xmath137  k star than for a 40,000  k one !",
    "one can easily assess the influence of the red leak by recomputing the same coefficients after cutting it out from the response curve of the filter , in this case the f170w .",
    "what one finds , then , is that , while the extinction coefficient for @xmath138  k is virtually unchanged , the one for @xmath137  k increases by a factor of 3 , thus reducing the difference between them to about 30% .",
    "the residual difference in @xmath136 between different temperatures , the lower one yielding to lower extinction coefficients , is caused by the fact that filters have a finite , non negligible bandwidth and , thus , the effective extinction in a band depends on the shape of the spectrum which is a function of temperature .",
    "the same explanation applies for the fact ( also illustrated in table  [ tab : abs ] ) that extinction coefficients become smaller as the optical depth of the dust increases because dust extinction makes a spectral energy distribution become redder .",

    "<S> we present a new technique based on multi - band near ultraviolet and optical photometry to measure both the stellar intrinsic properties , _ i.e. _  luminosity and effective temperature , and the interstellar dust extinction along the line of sight to hundreds of stars per square arcminute . </S>",
    "<S> the yield is twofold . on the one hand , </S>",
    "<S> the resulting reddening map has a very high spatial resolution , of the order of a few arcseconds , and can be quite effectively used in regions where the interstellar material is patchy , thus producing considerable differential extinction on small angular scales . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> combining the photometric information over a wide baseline in wavelength provides an accurate determination of temperature and luminosity for thousands of stars . as a test case </S>",
    "<S> , we present the results for the region around supernova  1987a in the large magellanic cloud imaged with the _ wfpc2 _  on board the hubble space telescope . </S>"
