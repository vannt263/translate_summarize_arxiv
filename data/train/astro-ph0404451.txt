    "in 1951 , von weizscker ( 1951 ) outlined a theory for interstellar matter ( ism ) that is similar to what we believe today : cloudy objects with a hierarchy of structures form in interacting shock waves by supersonic turbulence that is stirred on the largest scale by differential galactic rotation and dissipated on small scales by atomic viscosity .",
    "the `` clouds '' disperse quickly because of turbulent motions , and on the largest scales they produce the flocculent spiral structures observed in galaxies . in the same year",
    ", von hoerner ( 1951 ) noticed that rms differences in emission - line velocities of the orion nebula increased with projected separation as a power law with a power @xmath0 between 0.25 and 0.5 , leading him to suggest that the gas was turbulent with a kolmogorov energy cascade ( for which @xmath0 would be @xmath1 ; section 4.6 ) .",
    "wilson et al . (",
    "1959 ) later got a steeper function , @xmath2 , using better data , and proposed it resulted from compressible turbulence .",
    "correlated motions with a kolmogorov structure function ( section [ sect : diag ] ) in optical absorption lines were observed by kaplan ( 1958 ) .",
    "one of the first statistical models of a continuous and correlated gas distribution was by chandrasekhar & mnch ( 1952 ) , who applied it to extinction fluctuations in the milky way surface brightness .",
    "minkowski ( 1955 ) called the ism `` an entirely chaotic mass ... of all possible shapes and sizes ... broken up into numerous irregular details . ''",
    "these early proposals regarding pervasive turbulence failed to catch on .",
    "interstellar absorption and emission lines looked too smooth to come from an irregular network of structures ",
    "a problem that is still with us today ( section 2 ) .",
    "the extinction globules studied by bok & reilly ( 1947 ) looked too uniform and round , suggesting force equilibrium .",
    "oort & spitzer ( 1955 ) did not believe von weizscker s model because they thought galactic rotational energy could not cascade down to the scale of cloud linewidths without severe dissipation in individual cloud collisions .",
    "similar concerns about dissipation continue to be discussed ( sections [ sect : heating ] , [ sect : decay ] ) .",
    "oort and spitzer also noted that the ism morphology appeared wrong for turbulence : `` instead of more or less continuous vortices , we find concentrated clouds that are often separated by much larger spaces of negligible density . ''",
    "they expected turbulence to resemble the model of the time , with space - filling vortices in an incompressible fluid , rather than today s model with most of the mass compressed to a small fraction of the volume in shocks fronts .",
    "when a reddening survey by scheffler ( 1967 ) used structure functions to infer power - law correlated structures up to 5@xmath3 in the sky , the data were characterized by saying only that there were two basic cloud types , large ( 70 pc ) and small ( 3 pc ) , the same categories popularized by spitzer ( 1968 ) in his textbook .",
    "most of the interesting physical processes that could be studied theoretically at the time , such as the expansion of ionized nebulae and supernovae ( sne ) and the collapse of gas into stars , could be modeled well enough with a uniform isothermal medium .",
    "away from these sources , the ism was viewed as mostly static , with discrete clouds moving ballistically .",
    "the discovery of broad emission lines and narrow absorption lines in _",
    "h i _ at 21 cm reinforced this picture by suggesting a warm intercloud medium in thermal pressure balance with the cool clouds ( clark 1965 ) .",
    "ism models with approximate force equilibrium allowed an ease of calculation and conceptualization that was not present with turbulence .",
    "supernovae were supposed to account for the energy , but mostly by heating and ionizing the diffuse phases ( mccray & snow 1979 ) . even after the discoveries of the hot intercloud ( bunner et al .",
    "1971 , jenkins & meloy 1974 ) and cold molecular media ( wilson et al .",
    "1970 ) , the observation of a continuous distribution of neutral hydrogen temperature ( dickey , salpeter , & terzian 1977 ) , and the attribution of gas motions to supernovae ( e.g. , mckee & ostriker 1977 ) , there was no compelling reason to dismiss the basic cloud - intercloud model in favor of widespread turbulence . instead",
    ", the list of ism equilibrium `` phases '' was simply enlarged .",
    "supersonic linewidths , long known from _",
    "( e.g. , mcgee , milton , & wolfe 1966 , heiles 1970 ) and optical ( e.g. , hobbs 1974 ) studies and also discovered in molecular regions at this time ( see zuckerman & palmer 1974 ) , were thought to represent magnetic waves in a uniform cloud ( arons & max 1975 ) , even though turbulence was discussed as another possibility in spite of problems with the rapid decay rate ( goldreich & kwan 1974 , zuckerman & evans 1974 ) .",
    "a lone study by baker ( 1973 ) found large - scale correlations in _",
    "h i _ emission and presented them the context of ism turbulence , deriving the number of `` turbulent cells in the line of sight , '' instead of the number of `` clouds . ''",
    "mebold , hachenberg & laury - micoulaut ( 1974 ) followed this with another statistical analysis of the _",
    "h i _ emission .",
    "however , there was no theoretical context in which the baker and mebold et al .",
    "papers could flourish given the pervasive models about discrete clouds and two or three - phase equilibrium .",
    "the presence of turbulence was more widely accepted for very small scales .",
    "observations of interstellar scintillation at radio wavelengths implied there were correlated structures ( rickett 1970 ) , possibly related to turbulence ( little & matheson 1973 ) , in the ionized gas at scales down to @xmath4 cm or lower ( salpeter 1969 ; _ interstellar turbulence ii , _ next chapter , this volume ) .",
    "this is the same scale at which cosmic rays ( _ interstellar turbulence ii _ ) were supposed to excite magnetic turbulence by streaming instabilities ( wentzel 1968a ) .",
    "however , there was ( and still is ) little understanding of the physical connection between these small - scale fluctuations and the larger - scale motions in the cool neutral gas .",
    "dense structures on resolvable scales began to look more like turbulence after larson ( 1981 ) found power - law correlations between molecular cloud sizes and linewidths that were reminiscent of the kolmogorov scaling law .",
    "larson s work was soon followed by more homogeneous observations that showed similar correlations ( myers 1983 , dame et al .",
    "1986 , solomon et al .",
    "these motions were believed to be turbulent because of their power - law nature , despite continued concern with decay times , but there was little recognition that turbulence on larger scales could also form the same structures in which the linewidths were measured .",
    "several reviews during this time reflect the pending transition ( dickey 1985 , dickman 1985 , scalo 1987 , dickey & lockman 1990 ) .",
    "perhaps the most widespread change in perception came when the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) observed interstellar `` cirrus '' and other clouds in emission at 100 @xmath5 ( low et al .",
    "the cirrus clouds are mostly transparent at optical wavelengths , so they should be in the diffuse cloud category , but they were seen to be filamentary and criss - crossed , with little resemblance to `` standard '' clouds .",
    "equally complex structures were present even in iras maps of `` dark clouds , '' like taurus , and they were observed in maps of molecular clouds , such as the orion region ( bally et al .",
    "the wide field of view and good dynamic range of these new surveys finally allowed the diffuse and molecular clouds to reveal their full structural complexity , just as the optical nebulae and dark clouds did two decades earlier . contributing to this change in perception was the surprising discovery by crovisier & dickey ( 1983 ) of a power spectrum for widespread _",

    "the efficiency for the conversion of gravitational binding energy into turbulence is unknown , but because gravitational forces act on all of the matter and , unlike stellar explosions , do not require a hot phase of evolution during which energy can radiate , the efficiency might be high .",
    "conventional fluid instabilities provide other sources of turbulence on the scales over which they act .",
    "for example , a cloud hit by a shock front will shed its outer layers and become turbulent downstream ( xu & stone 1995 ) , and the interior of the cloud can be energized as well ( miesch & zweibel 1994 , kornreich & scalo 2000 ) .",

    "it is also possible that the kinetic energy of a shock can be directly converted into turbulent energy behind the shock ( rotman 1991 ; andreopoulos , agui & briassulis 2000 ) .",
    "kritsuk & norman ( 2002a , b ) discuss how thermal instabilities can drive turbulence , in which case the underlying power source is stellar radiation rather than kinetic energy .",
    "there are many individual sources for turbulence , but the energy usually comes from one of the main categories of sources listed above .",
    "sources of interstellar turbulence span such a wide range of scales that it is often difficult to identify any particular source for a given cloud or region .",
    "little is known about the behavior of turbulence that is driven like this .",
    "the direction and degree of energy transfer and the morphology of the resulting flow could be greatly affected by the type and scale of energy input ( see biferale et al .",
    "however , it appears that for average disk conditions the power input is dominated by cluster winds or superbubbles with an injection scale of @xmath109 pc .",
    "turbulence is nonlinear fluid motion resulting in the excitation of an extreme range of correlated spatial and temporal scales .",
    "there is no clear scale separation for perturbation approximations , and the number of degrees of freedom is too large to treat as chaotic and too small to treat in a statistical mechanical sense . turbulence is deterministic and unpredictable , but it is not reducible to a low - dimensional system and so does not exhibit the properties of classical chaotic dynamical systems .",
    "the strong correlations and lack of scale separation preclude the truncation of statistical equations at any order .",
    "this means that the moments of the fluctuating fields evaluated at high order can not be interpreted as analogous to moments of the microscopic particle distribution , i.e. , the rms velocity can not be used as a pressure .",
    "hydrodynamic turbulence arises because the nonlinear advection operator , @xmath110 , generates severe distortions of the velocity field by stretching , folding , and dilating fluid elements .",
    "the effect can be viewed as a continuous set of topological deformations of the velocity field ( ottino 1989 ) , but in a much higher dimensional space than chaotic systems so that the velocity field is , in effect , a stochastic field of nonlinear straining .",
    "these distortions self - interact to generate large amplitude structure covering the available range of scales . for incompressible turbulence driven at large scales , this range",
    "is called the inertial range because the advection term corresponds to inertia in the equation of motion . for a purely hydrodynamic incompressible system",
    ", this range is measured by the ratio of the advection term to the viscous term , which is the reynolds number @xmath111 , where @xmath112 and @xmath113 are the characteristic large - scale velocity and length , @xmath114 is the length in parsecs , @xmath115 is the mach number , @xmath65 is the density , and @xmath116 is the kinematic viscosity . in the cool ism , @xmath117",
    "to @xmath118 if viscosity is the damping mechanism ( less if ambipolar diffusion dominates ; section [ sect : sim ] ) .",
    "another physically important range is the taylor scale reynolds number , which is @xmath119 for @xmath120 the ratio of the rms velocity to the rms velocity gradient ( see miesch et al .",
    "1999 ) .    with compressibility , magnetic fields , or self - gravity ,",
    "all the associated fields are distorted by the velocity field and exert feedback on it .",
    "hence , one can have mhd turbulence , gravitational turbulence , or thermally driven turbulence , but they are all fundamentally tied to the advection operator .",
    "these additional effects introduce new globally conserved quadratic quantities and eliminate others ( e.g. , kinetic energy is not an inviscid conserved quantity in compressible turbulence ) , leading to fundamental changes in the behavior . this may affect the way energy is distributed among scales , which is often referred to as the cascade .",
    "wave turbulence occurs in systems dominated by nonlinear wave interactions , including plasma waves ( tsytovich 1972 ) , inertial waves in rotating fluids ( galtier 2003 ) , acoustic turbulence ( lvov , lvov & pomyalov 2000 ) , and internal gravity waves ( lelong & riley 1991 ) .",
    "a standard procedure for treating these weakly nonlinear systems is with a kinetic equation that describes the energy transfer attributable to interactions of three ( in some cases four ) waves with conservation of energy and momentum ( see zakharov , lvov & falkovich 1992 ) .",
    "wave turbulence is usually propagating , long - lived , coherent , weakly nonlinear , and weakly dissipative , whereas fully developed fluid turbulence is diffusive , short - lived , incoherent , strongly nonlinear , and strongly dissipative ( dewan 1985 ) .",
    "in both wave and fluid turbulence , energy is transferred among scales , and when it is fed at the largest scales with dissipation at the smallest scales , a kolmogorov or other power - law power spectrum often results .",
    "court ( 1965 ) suggested that wave turbulence be called undulence to distinguish it from the different physical processes involved in fully developed fluid turbulence .",

    "an important dimensionless number is the sonic mach number @xmath136 , where @xmath137 is the sound speed . for most ism turbulence , @xmath138 - 10 , so it is rarely incompressible and often supersonic , producing shocks .      in turbulent flows all of the variables in",
    "the hydrodynamic equations are strongly fluctuating and can be described only statistically .",

    "an equation for the three - point correlations generates terms involving four - point correlations , and so on .",

    "there is an additional positive - definite quadratic invariant , the enstrophy or mean square vorticity @xmath151 .",
    "the derivative in the enstrophy implies that it selectively decays to smaller scales faster than the energy , with the result that the kinetic energy undergoes an inverse cascade to smaller wave numbers .",
    "this result was first pointed out by kraichnan ( 1967 ) and has been verified in numerous experiments and simulations ( see tabeling 2002 for a comprehensive review of 2d turbulence ) . because of the absence of the vorticity stretching term @xmath152 in the 2d vorticity equation , which produces the complex system of vortex worms seen in 3d turbulence , 2d turbulence evolves into a system of vortices that grow with time through their merging .    in 2d - compressible turbulence the square of the potential vorticity ( @xmath153 )",

    "a study of the degree of cancellation of long - range three - wave interactions in incompressible hydrodynamic turbulence by zhou , yeung & brasseur ( 1996 ) shows that nonlocal interactions cause anisotropy at small scales , and the effect may increase with the scale separation .",

    "these local relations also follow if the local anisotropy , @xmath276 , is proportional to the ratio of the local perturbed field to the total field ( matthaeus et al . 1998 ; cho , lazarian & vishniac 2003a ) .",
    "the global relation between @xmath277 and @xmath274 , averaged over a large scale , can actually be more isotropic , @xmath278 , if the local field lines bend significantly on the small scale ( cho , lazarian & vishniac 2002a ) .    a schematic diagram of a turbulent cascade is shown in figure [ fig : waves ] , from maron & goldreich ( 2001 ) .",

    "the relative energy in the compressible part grew from zero to only 5%10% after three crossing times , which implies the slow mode is weakly coupled to the shear mode .",
    "for purely solenoidal driving , the alfvn and slow modes had @xmath256 energy scaling for velocity and field , and the slow mode had @xmath256 scaling for the density ; the fast modes had all three variables scale like @xmath257 .",
    "cho & lazarian ( 2003 ) did similar calculations for the high @xmath280 case and got the same results for mode coupling and energy spectra .",
    "most of the density structure was from slow modes at low @xmath280 , but at high @xmath280 it came from a nearly equal combination of slow and fast modes .",
    "cho & lazarian ( 2003 ) showed that even for highly compressible supersonic turbulence , the alfvn mode , which barely couples to the compression , cascades like an incompressible fluid with an energy spectrum @xmath281 .",
    "these scalings are consistent with the isotropies measured for the three modes ( cho & lazarian 2002b ) .",
    "alfvn modes and their passive slow counterparts have velocities that depend on the propagation direction relative to the field ( at low @xmath280 ) .",
    "this makes them anisotropic with @xmath270 , as discussed above .",
    "fast modes have equal velocities in all directions at low @xmath280 , and the resulting isotropy makes @xmath282 , as proposed by kraichnan ( 1965 ) .",
    "cho & lazarian ( 2002b ) further reasoned that slow modes are passive at low @xmath280 because they move very slowly relative to the alfvn waves ( @xmath283 for thermal speed @xmath137 ) , so the alfvn waves can distort them easily .",
    "cho , lazarian & vishniac ( 2002b ) proposed that magnetic irregularities should persist without corresponding velocity irregularities below the viscous damping length ( @xmath77 , see section [ sect : be ] ) , down to the scale at which magnetic diffusion becomes important .",
    "damping in the equation of motion comes from a term @xmath284 , and magnetic diffusion comes from a term like @xmath285 ; the ratio @xmath286 is the prandtl number .",
    "cho et al . considered large prandtl numbers and found that the kinetic energy between the viscous and the diffusion lengths cascaded more steeply than the magnetic energy : @xmath287 and @xmath288 .",

    "the first simulations of what can now be seen as ism turbulence go back over 20 years ( bania & lyon 1980 ) , but it is only within the past 5 to 10 years that the field has matured enough to concentrate on the inherently turbulent aspects of the problem .",

    "any turbulent velocity field can be decomposed into a solenoidal ( rotational ) mode and a compressible ( potential or irrotational ) mode and each mode can feed the other ( sasao 1973 ) .",
    "it is of great interest to know the relative energy in each .",
    "intuitively it might seem that the result should scale with mach number because at zero mach number the flow is purely incompressible and at infinite mach number it should be mostly compressible .",

    "however , shivamoggi ( 1997 ) used a statistical mechanical approach and found that the advection operator should evolve toward an equipartition between compressible and vortical modes .",
    "what do simulations have to say about this ratio ?",
    "a major problem with simulations , especially at the molecular cloud level , is the use of large - scale forcing in fourier space .",
    "this has the effect of stirring the gas in the entire computational domain simultaneously .",
    "the situation in the ism , at least at intermediate and small scales , is likely to be different .",
    "artificial forcing is usually solenoidal also , whereas stellar energy sources will mostly generate compressible fluctuations . generally ,",

    "2002 is @xmath343 whereas the quantity plotted in their figure 2 is @xmath344 ) .",
    "most results are controlled by the degree to which the forcing is solenoidal or compressible , the initial value of their ratio ( porter et al . 2002 ) , the rms mach number , the magnetic field strength , and the importance of cooling ( vzquez - semadeni et al . 1996 ) .",
    "vestuto , ostriker & stone ( 2003 ) found that the solenoidal / compressional ratio increases with higher magnetic field strength , verifying an effect present in simulations by passot et al .",

    "the unforced simulations of kritsuk & norman ( 2003 ) have an initially high fraction of turbulent energy in the compressible form following thermal instabilities and pancake formation , and then the energy converts into mostly solenoidal form as the turbulence decays owing to baroclinic vorticity generation from shell instabilities .",
    "the value of this ratio was unfortunately not given in papers whose simulations included supernova energy input ; those should be the most realistic for the ism .",
    "the prevalence of filaments in the ism has never been adequately explained by turbulence theory , although they are obviously present in the majority of simulations .",
    "some ism filaments are not from turbulence but are the edges of expanding shells , cometary tails of shocked clouds , or shocked regions in spiral density waves",
    ". however , filamentary structure appears elsewhere too , even in regions without obvious pressure sources ( kulkarni & heiles 1988 , jackson et al .",

    "the idea that thermal instability drives ism condensation to distinct phases ( field , goldsmith & habing 1969 ) has lost much of its appeal as a result of simulations that explicitly allow the instability to operate .",
    "vzquez - semadeni , gazol & scalo ( 2000 ) and snchez - salcedo , vzquez - semadeni & gazol ( 2002 ) showed how turbulence smears the bimodal density distribution expected in an ism whose structure forms solely by thermal instability .",
    "the nonlinear development of a thermal instability in an initially quiescent medium generates turbulence that reduces the initial signature of the instability ( kritsuk & norman 2002b ) .",
    "these results do not arise because of strong departures from thermal equilibrium ( which is usually a good approximation away from shocks ) , but simply because there is so much more kinetic than thermal energy in supersonic turbulence .",

    "even mild levels of turbulence during a collapse can induce multiple star formation ( klein et al .",
    "2003 ; goodwin , whitworth & ward - thompson 2004 ) .",
    "most mhd simulations suggest that magnetic fields have a smaller role in the ism than previously expected .",
    "for example , they seem unable to postpone the energy dissipation in a supersonically turbulent medium ( section [ sect : decay ] ) and unable to prevent local gravitational collapse unless they are strong ( heitsch et al .",
    "2001 ; ostriker et al . 2001 ; however , see kudoh & basu 2003 ) .",
    "passot & vzquez - semadeni ( 2003 ) and cho & lazarian ( 2003 ) demonstrated that magnetic fluctuations do not act as an effective pressure at high mach numbers because of their lack of one - to - one correspondence with density : the field acts more like a random forcing of the turbulence .",
    "what magnetic fields appear to do is reduce the core density contrast ( balsara , crutcher & pouquet 2001 ) and slow down the local collapse rate ( heitsch et al . 2001 ) .",
    "this may not affect the overall star - formation rate much because the timescale for core formation is much longer than the core collapse itself .",
    "for turbulent fragmentation , star - formation rates should be regulated on the largest scale where the dynamical time is longest .",
    "the marginal effects of magnetic fields on the clump or core mass spectra and presumably the stellar imf were discussed in section [ sect : clusters ] .",
    "padoan & nordlund ( 1999 ) suggested that magnetic fields are relatively weak in molecular clouds , having energy densities less than turbulent so the motions are super - alfvnic ( see review in nordlund & padoan 2003 ) .",
    "polarization observations show smooth magnetic fields , but this does not mean turbulence is absent ( see review by ostriker 2003 ) . as discussed by vzquez - semadeni et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , cloud formation by turbulence can compress the field perpendicular to the compression direction , making it elongated in the same direction as the cloud ; turbulent magnetic field - energy spectra are peaked at small wave numbers in simulations , so the field should be dominated by the largest scales , and the observed field orientations are an average on the line of sight ( heiles et al .",
    "1993 , goodman et al .",
    "visual polarization also probes only a small range of extinction .",
    "ambipolar diffusion is relatively unimportant in the overall dynamics of molecular cloud turbulence at high mach numbers ( balsara , crutcher & pouquet 2001 ) .",
    "indeed , observations now suggest that ion - neutral drift is rapid at @xmath350 @xmath84 , based on comparisons of hco+ and hcn linewidths ( houde et al .",
    "the old idea that protostellar cores form on timescales controlled by ambipolar diffusion may not apply .    ion - neutral drift is not without consequences , however . the ambipolar diffusion heating rate in molecular cloud turbulence simulations ( padoan , zweibel & nordlund 2000 ) can be orders of magnitude larger on small scales than the background heating rate by cosmic rays , and even the volume - averaged drift heating rate can exceed the cosmic ray heating rate ( scalo 1977 ) .",
    "heating can be important if dynamical effects are not because there is much less thermal energy than kinetic energy in a supersonic flow .",
    "drift heating is also more important locally because it depends on a high - order derivative of the magnetic field .",
    "thus , turbulence can enhance ambipolar diffusion by driving structures to smaller scales ( zweibel 2002 , heitsch et al . 2004 ) and compressing the field ( fatuzzo & adams 2002 ) .",
    "ambipolar diffusion also leads to sharp filamentary structures ( brandenburg & zweibel 1994 ; mac low et al . 1995 ; tagger , falgarone & shukurov 1995 ) , rather than diffusive smoothing as once thought .",
    "turbulent cloud simulations ( gammie et al . 2003 ) also illustrate why the observed clumps and cores in molecular clouds tend to be prolate ( myers et al .",
    "1991 , ryden 1996 ) with no preferred orientation relative to the field ( goodman et al .",
    "quasistatic models with a slow contraction along field lines predicted oblate and aligned cores .",
    "another interesting result concerning magnetic fields is the possibility that they could control the accretion rate onto protostellar cores or larger structures .",
    "balsara , ward - thompson & crutcher ( 2001 ) found with @xmath351 self - gravitating mhd simulations that molecular cloud cores tend to accrete matter nonuniformly along interconnecting magnetic filaments .",
    "they cite evidence for this process in the s106 molecular cloud using @xmath43co channel maps , submillimeter maps , and polarimetry .",
    "falgarone , pety & phillips ( 2001 ) found six dense filaments pointing toward the starless core l1512 extending out to about 1 pc , with evidence for the filamentary matter moving toward the core . in this case",
    "the final masses of prestellar cores could be controlled in part by the topology of the magnetic field .",
    "another magnetic effect is angular momentum braking , which has been discussed for decades using idealized models of clouds and fields . in a turbulent medium",
    "the magnetic field structure and its connection to density condensations is complex , and there is no guarantee that braking will occur .",
    "vzquez - semadeni , passot & pouquet ( 1996 ) and vestuto , ostriker & stone ( 2003 ) show relatively more power in rotational and shear energy than compressional energy as the field strength increases , contrary to naive models of magnetic braking .",
    "that magnetic braking does occur in a turbulent fluid with complex fields has been shown in simulations of the magnetorotational instability on a galactic scale ( kim , ostriker & stone 2003 ) .",
    "the degree of braking of their largest coherent condensations may explain the low specific angular momenta inferred for molecular clouds .",
    "this is a much larger scale than star - forming cores , but the basic effect of angular momentum transfer along field lines is analogous to the cases considered in idealized collapse models by mouschovias & paleologou ( 1979 ) and others .",
    "a different approach was introduced by cho and coworkers ( see cho & lazarian 2002a , b ; cho , lazarian & vishniac 2002a , b ) , maron & goldreich ( 2001 ) , and mller & biskamp ( 2003 ) using a combination of theoretical calculations and simulations to address the properties of anisotropic kolmogorov turbulence .",
    "they emphasized regimes that are more appropriate to the diffuse ionized ism than dense cold regions .",
    "several interesting and fundamental results have come from this , as reviewed in section [ sect : goldreich ] and _ interstellar turbulence ii_.      simulation codes are finally becoming sophisticated enough to model at least the central regions of differentially rotating galaxies , with simulations of 2 kpc x 2 kpc up to @xmath352 ( wada & norman 2001 , wada et al .",
    "various models include self - gravity , cooling and background heating , and dynamical heating from cluster winds and supernovae coupled to star formation .",
    "the resulting density and temperature structures span seven and five orders of magnitude , respectively .",
    "the wada et al .",
    "( 2002 ) models are not yet 3d , and they neglect magnetic fields , but a lot of realistic structure is present anyway . for example , filaments form in oblique converging flows and strong local shear ( wada et al .",
    "2002 ) , statistically stable temperature regimes appear on large scales , the supernova rate fluctuates in recurrent bursts from propagating - star formation , and the density pdf is lognormal over four orders of magnitude above the mean .",
    "the models also find that the energy spectrum and direction of the energy flow in wave number space depends on the presence of star formation feedback , the wavelength dependence of the disk gravitational instability , and the assumed rotation curve for the galaxy ( compare wada & norman 2001 , figure 18 , and wada et al .",
    "2002 , figures 4 and 5 ) .",
    "wada , spaans & kim ( 2000 ) also suggested that turbulence alone could account for the kpc - sized holes seen in other galaxies , independent of star formation .",
    "interstellar turbulence has been studied using power spectra and structure functions of the distributions of radial velocity , emission , and absorption , using statistical properties of line profiles , unsharp masks , and wavelet transforms , one - point probability distribution functions of column densities and velocity centroids , fractal dimensions and multifractal spectra , and various other techniques including the spectral correlation function and principal component analysis , which are applied to spectral line data cubes .",
    "the results are often ambiguous and difficult to interpret .",
    "the density of the neutral medium seems to possess spatial correlations over a wide range of scales , possibly from the sub - parsec limit of resolution to hundreds of parsecs .",
    "such correlations probably reflect the hierarchical nature of turbulence in a medium with a very large reynolds number .",
    "the power spectrum of the associated intensity fluctuations is a robust power law with a slope between -1.8 and -2.3 for the milky way , lmc , and smc .",
    "a steeper slope has been obtained for galactic co using principle component analysis . however , no clear power spectrum or autocorrelation function has been found yet for centroid velocities as a function of spatial lag inside individual clouds , even though they might be expected if the clouds are turbulent .",
    "statistical properties of the ism are difficult to recover with only line - of - sight motions in projected cloud maps that have limited spatial extent and substantial noise .",
    "linewidths often seem correlated with region size in an average sense , but there are large variations between different regions and surveys . at the moment , this relation seems to be dominated by scatter . because the linewidth - size correlation is analogous to a second order structure function , which is well - defined for incompressible turbulence , the regional variations are difficult to understand in the context of conventional turbulence theory .",
    "certainly a case could be made that ism turbulence is not conventional : it is not statistically homogeneous , stationary , or isotropic .    considering the difficulty of observing three - dimensional structure and motion in space , the value of statistical descriptors lies primarily in their ability to make detailed comparisons between observations and simulations .",
    "many such comparisons have been made , but a comprehensive simulation of a particular region including many of the descriptors listed above is not yet available .    among the many differences between interstellar turbulence and classical incompressible turbulence is the broad spatial scale for energy input in space . in spite of the wide ranging spatial correlations in emission and absorption maps , there is no analogy with classical turbulence in which energy is injected on the largest scale and then cascades in a self - similar fashion to the very small scale of dissipation . in the ism",
    ", energy is injected over a wide range of scales , from kiloparsec disturbances in spiral density waves , shear instabilities , and superbubbles , to parsec - sized explosions in supernovae , massive - star winds and _ h ii _ regions , to sub - parsec motions in low - mass stellar winds and stellar gravitational wakes , to au - sized motions powered by cosmic ray streaming instabilities .",
    "estimates of power input indicate that stellar explosions are the largest contributor numerically , but this does not mean that other sources are unimportant on other scales .",
    "energy is also dissipated over a wide range of scales .",
    "shock fronts , ambipolar and ohmic diffusion , landau wave damping , and viscosity in vortex tubes should all play a role .",
    "the geometrical structures of the dissipating regions are not well constrained by observations .",
    "energy is also dissipated in regions with little density sub - structure , as in the ionized gas that produces scintillation or along perturbed magnetic field lines that scatter some cosmic rays .",
    "viscosity and landau damping can produce heat from the tiny wave - like motions that occur in these regions ( see interstellar turbulence , part ii ) , although the nature of this dissipation below the collision mean free path is not understood yet .",
    "self - gravity makes interstellar turbulence more difficult to understand than terrestrial turbulence .",
    "the contribution to ism motions from self - gravity appears to increase with cloud mass until it dominates above @xmath79@xmath130 m@xmath353 .",
    "many selection effects may contribute to this correlation , however .",
    "self - gravity is also important in the smaller clumps that form stars .",
    "what happens between these scales remains a mystery .",
    "we would like to know how the distribution function of the ratio of virial mass to luminous mass for ism clouds and clumps varies with the spatial scales of these structures .",
    "what fraction of clouds or clumps are self - gravitating for each mass range ? does the apparent trend toward diminished self - gravity on small scales turn around on the scale of individual protostars ?",
    "the balance between solenoidal and compressible energy density in the ism varies with time .",
    "compressibility transfers energy between kinetic and thermal modes , short - circuiting the cascade of energy in wavenumber space that occurs in a self - similar fashion for incompressible turbulence .",
    "consequently the ism turbulent power spectra for kinetic and magnetic energy are not known from terrestrial analogies , and there is not even a theoretical or heuristic justification for expecting self - similar or power - law behavior .",
    "numerical simulations make predictions of these quantities , but these simulations are usually idealized and they are always limited by resolution and other numerical effects .",
    "a considerable effort has been put into modelling compressible mhd turbulence under idealized conditions , i.e. , without self - gravity and without dispersed and realistic energy sources ( e.g. , explosions ) .",
    "some models predict analytically and confirm numerically a kolmogorov energy spectrum transverse to the mean field when the magnetic energy density is not much larger than the kinetic energy density .",
    "these models also predict intermittency properties identical to hydrodynamic turbulence in this trans - field direction .",
    "other models find steeper power spectra , however .",
    "one has mostly solenoidal motions on large scales and sheet - like dissipation regions on small scales .",
    "another has more realistic heating and cooling . at very strong fields ,",
    "the turbulence becomes more restricted to the two transverse dimensions and then the energy spectrum seems to become flatter , as in the iroshnikov - kraichnan model .",
    "overall the situation regarding the energy spectrum of mhd ism turbulence is unsettled .",
    "our understanding of the ism has benefited greatly from numerical simulations . in the 10 or so years since the first simulations of ism turbulence , numerical models have reproduced most of the observed correlations and scaling relations .",
    "they have demonstrated that supersonic turbulence always decays quickly and concluded that star formation is equally fast , forcing a link between cold clouds and their energy - rich environments .",
    "they have also predicted a somewhat universal probability function for density in an isothermal gas , implying that only a small fraction of the gas mass can ever be in a dense enough state to collapse gravitationally  thereby explaining the low efficiency of star formation .",
    "simulations have demonstrated that magnetism does not support clouds , prevent collapse , systematically align small clumps , or act like an effective pressure .",
    "magnetism can slow collapsing cores and remove angular momentum on large and small scales , and it may contribute to filamentary structures that control the accretion rate of gas onto protostars .",
    "simulations have also shown that thermal instabilities do not lead to bimodal density distributions as previously believed , although they probably enhance the compressibility of the ism and might contribute to the turbulent motions .",
    "the high abundance of atomic gas in what would be the thermally unstable regime of static models is easily explained in a turbulent medium .",
    "simulations have a long way to go before solving some of the most important problems , however .",
    "models are needed that include realistic cooling , ionization balance , chemistry , radiative transfer , ambipolar diffusion , magnetic reconnection , and especially realistic forcing because it is not clear that any of these effects are negligible .",
    "detailed models should be able to form star clusters in a realistic fashion , continuing the progress that has already been made with restricted resolution and input physics .",
    "complete models need to include energy sources from young stellar winds , ionization , and heating , and they should be able to follow the orbital dynamics of binaries .",
    "successful models should eventually explain the stellar initial mass function , mass segregation , the binary fraction and distribution of binary orbital periods , the mean magnetic flux in a star , and the overall star - formation efficiency at the time of cloud disruption .",
    "realistic simulations of galactic - scale processes are also challenging because they should include a large range of scales and fundamentally different physical processes in the radial and vertical directions .",
    "background galactic dynamics and the possibility of energy and mass exchange with a three - dimensional halo are also important .",
    "the turbulent model of the ism also raises substantial new questions .",
    "why is the power spectrum of ism density structure a power law when direct observation shows the ism to be a collection of shells , bubbles , comets , spiral wave shocks and other pressurized structures spanning a wide range of scales ? do directed pressures and turbulence combine to produce the observed power spectrum or does one dominate to other ?",
    "does the input of energy on one scale prevent the turbulent cascade of energy that is put in on a larger scale ? in this respect ,",
    "is ism turbulence more similar to turbulent combustion than incompressible turbulence because of the way in which energy is injected ?",
    "our current embrace of turbulence theory as an explanation for ism structures and motions may be partly based on an overly - simplification of available models and a limitation of observational techniques .",
    "this state of the field guarantees more surprises in the coming decade .    _",
