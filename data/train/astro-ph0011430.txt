    "the most distinctive feature in the optical spectra of fir - luminous galaxies is not the equivalent width of the emission lines , but the equivalent width of the @xmath0 line in absorption , which is generally stronger than in the spectra of optically selected galaxies .",
    "in fact , emission line spectra with ew(@xmath2 @xmath3 ( e(a ) spectra ) are frequent among fir galaxies , while the great majority of nearby spirals in optical samples have ew(@xmath4 @xmath3 ( e(c ) spectra ) ( poggianti et al . 1999 [ p99 ] ; poggianti & wu 2000 [ pw00 ] ) . the e(a ) spectral class differs from the so - called `` k+a '' ( or `` e+a '' ) galaxies which only display a strong @xmath0 line in absorption , but no emission lines .",
    "what is the origin of the difference in the @xmath0 strength between dusty starburst galaxies and quiescent spirals ?",
    "what star formation and dust properties generate the peculiar spectral combination found in e(a ) galaxies ? in the following i will address these issues presenting the analysis of a spectroscopic survey of luminous iras galaxies ( pw00 ) and the results of an effort to model the e(a ) spectrum in detail ( poggianti , bressan & franceschini 2001 ) .",
    "in pw00 we analyzed the spectral characteristics of a complete sample of iras galaxies ( wu et al .",
    "1998a , b ) comprising 73 very luminous infrared galaxies ( vlirgs , @xmath5 ) with a median @xmath6 and 40 companion galaxies , selected from the 2 jy redshift survey of strauss et al .",
    "the great majority of these galaxies show evidence for a strong interaction or a merger ( wu et al .",
    "the spectra typically cover the central 2 kpc of the galaxies at a @xmath7 @xmath3 resolution .",
    "table  1 shows the fraction of vlirgs as a function of the spectral class ; a detailed description of each class can be found in pw00 .",
    "more than half of these galaxies have an e(a ) spectrum , about 1 out of 4 has an e(c ) spectrum , and only 1 out of 10 has very strong [ oii ] emission ( e(b ) type ) .",
    "none of the e(a ) spectra would be classified as a seyfert1 or 2 according to the standard diagnostic diagrams of line intensity ratios .",
    "notably no k+a spectrum is found among the fir luminous galaxies , neither among their companions : all the vlirgs display emission lines in their spectra .    )",
    "= 0.4 ew(@xmath1 + nii ) ) . ]    a general characteristic of the e(a ) spectra in all environments and at all redshifts appears to be the low [ oii]/@xmath1 ratio ( see fig .",
    "1 ) : both the equivalent width and the flux ratios of these lines are a factor of 2 lower than the median ratios observed in nearby spirals . though such low ratios may be caused by various reasons , the most likely explanation is reddening by dust : the color excess e(b - v ) derived from the observed balmer decrement ( see table  1 ) is consistent with  and fully accounts for  the observed [ oii]/@xmath1 values .",
    "it is noteworthy that the difference in the _ equivalent width _ ratio between this sample and optically selected nearby spirals is entirely due to the difference in the average _ flux _ ratio of these two lines .",
    "this can be interpreted as an effect of _ selective dust extinction _ which affects the youngest stellar generations ( still deeply embedded in large amounts of dust and responsible for the ionizing photons producing the emission lines ) much more than older , less extincted stellar populations producing the continuum underlying the lines : the net result is a low ew ratio .",
    "additional evidence for a selective extinction will be discussed in sec .",
    "luminosities in solar units . no dust correction has been applied .",
    "the best fit to the datapoints is shown as a solid line .",
    "the relation found by devereux & young ( 1990 ) for a sample of field spiral galaxies in the local universe is extrapolated to the fir luminosities of the present dataset and is shown as a dotted line .",
    "`` e '' spectra are those with at least one detected emission line , but @xmath0 unmeasurable . ]    as in all fir luminous samples , there is a deficiency of @xmath1 luminosity at a given fir luminosity as compared to optically selected spirals ( fig .  2 ) and this scarcity of @xmath1 flux translates directly into a difference in the sfr estimate : even applying to the @xmath1 flux the dust correction derived from the balmer decrement is not sufficient to reconcile the two estimates of current star formation obtained from the fir and @xmath1 luminosities ( fig .",
    "3 ) . after dust correction",
    ", the @xmath8 is still a factor of @xmath9 lower than the @xmath10 ; it is unlikely this discrepancy is entirely due to the limited aperture of the spectroscopic slit and i will come back to this point in sec .",
    "flux versus the fir  based estimate .",
    "the dotted line is the fit to the e(a ) population .",
    "the solid line shows the relation @xmath11 , and the dashed lines are found for 1 mag extinction at @xmath1 ( average extinction in nearby spirals ) and for the average extinction in e(a ) s in w98 sample as determined by the balmer decrement ( e(b - v)=1.1 , a(@xmath12 mag ) ]    fraction of galaxies and e(b - v ) as a function of the spectral class .",

    "this is the average spectrum of 5 iso - detected galaxies at @xmath15 whose spectral energy distributions at visible , near - ir , mir and radio wavelengths resemble those of highly reddened starbursts in the local universe .",
    "the spectral resolution is 10 @xmath3 ( wu ) and 40 @xmath3 ( flores ) .",
    "]    the analysis presented so far refers to a well defined sample of iras luminous galaxies , but the e(a ) phenomenon appears to be widespread among ir luminous galaxies at any redshift ( see pw00 for a census of the e(a ) occurrence ) . as an example , fig .",
    "4 shows that the average e(a ) spectrum of wu s sample is very similar to the average spectrum of distant starburst galaxies detected at 15 micron by iso , both in the continuum shape and in the strength of the [ oii ] , @xmath0 and @xmath16 lines .",
    "a selective dust extinction has been proposed as the physical origin of the e(a ) spectra ( p99 , pw00 ) : dust obscuration affects the youngest stellar generations more than the older stars .",
    "this is expected to explain both the observed [ oii]/@xmath1 ratio , as discussed in the previous section , and the @xmath0 strength because the stellar populations responsible for this line ( with ages a few times @xmath17  1.5 @xmath18 yr ) have had time to drift away from or disperse the dusty molecular clouds where they were born and their emission can dominate the integrated spectrum at 4000 @xmath3 if younger stars are more heavily obscured . furthermore , a selective extinction appears to be the most plausible explanation for the fact that , even within the same spectrum , different values of extinction are measured depending on the spectral region / feature used to estimate it : for example , the dust attenuation of the uv / optical stellar continuum is often measured to be lower than the obscuration of the emission lines ( see pw00 for a reference list ) .    in order to verify whether the hypothesis of selective extinction in a starburst galaxy can indeed account for the e(a ) spectrum , a simplified spectrophotometric model , including only 10 stellar populations ,",
    "has been developed ( poggianti , bressan & franceschini 2001 ) .",
    "this represents the minimum set of stellar populations that are known to be essential because they affect the spectral features that we wish to reproduce : four young generations ( @xmath19 yr ) responsible for the ionizing photons that produce the emission lines ; five intermediate populations ( @xmath20 yr ) with the strongest balmer lines in absorption , and older stars modelled as a constant star formation rate between 1 and 12 gyr before the moment of the observation which can give a significant contribution to the continuum .",
    "the spectrum of each stellar generation is found from a spectrophotometric model that includes both the stellar and the nebular contribution ( barbaro & poggianti 1997 ) and it is extincted with its own extinction value  that is allowed to vary from a stellar population to another  assuming a dust screen with a standard galactic extinction law and a salpeter imf between 0.1 and 100 @xmath21 .",
    "the results of this model are compared with the average e(a ) spectrum of the vlirgs discussed in sec .  2 ;",
    "the quality of the fit is assessed considering the differences between the model and the observed spectrum in the equivalent widths of four lines ( [ oii]@xmath223727,h@xmath23 , h@xmath24 and h@xmath25 ) and the continuum flux in eight spectral windows in the range 37706460  .",

    "the upper left panel of fig .  5 presents the comparison between the average e(a ) spectrum and a model of a burst that began @xmath28 yr ago ; the extinction of the starburst populations is significantly higher than that of the older generations ( see the right panel in fig .",
    "the fit is remarkable , both as far as the line equivalent widths and the continuum are concerned .",
    "but this is only at the 4% level . ]",
    "\\a ) slit aperture effects i.e. a mismatch in the galactic area sampled by the optical spectrum ( central 2 kpc ) and by iras ( integrated ) .",
    "given that the ir emissivity is usually concentrated in the central regions of luminous infrared galaxies , it is hard to envisage how slit effects can account for the discrepancy between the modelled and the observed ir flux .",
    "\\b ) dusty starburst galaxies often have star forming regions which are completely obscured at optical wavelengths , hence give no contribution to the spectrum but produce a significant fraction of the fir luminosity ( e.g. mirabel et al .",
    "the observed fir / v ratio can be reproduced by starburst models with regions that are highly obscured by dust with an e(b - v ) even greater than in the models of fig .",
    "\\3 ) no strong constraint can be placed on the burst duration .",
    "models with a starburst as short as a few times @xmath29 yr and as long as @xmath18 yr are able to fit the observed e(a ) spectrum as long as : a ) the youngest populations are highly extincted and b ) the old population provides a contribution but does not overwhelm the intermediate age contribution at 4000  .",
    "as an example , the lower left panel in fig .",
    "5 shows the excellent fit obtained with a current burst that began @xmath30 yr ago . in the case of short bursts ( @xmath31 yr ) ,",
    "the strong @xmath0 line is not produced by the stars born during the starburst event , but by the previous stellar populations .",
    "\\4 ) we also considered a family of `` post - starburst models '' with extinction , assuming a galaxy is seen _",
    "after _ a strong starburst phase when a small amount of residual star formation activity is still ongoing . this type of models  besides accounting for not more than @xmath32 of the observed fir luminosity  fail to reproduce simultaneously the @xmath1 and the @xmath16 lines , either underestimating the former or overestimating the latter .",
