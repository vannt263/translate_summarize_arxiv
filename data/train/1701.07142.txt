    "the irregular satellites in our solar system have been studied for many years .",
    "parts of them may be formed following with their host giant planets .",
    "however , some of these objects are widely believed to have been heliocentric asteroids before being captured by a giant planet s gravity ( colombo & franklin  @xcite ; heppenheimer & porco  @xcite ; pollack et al .",
    "@xcite ; sheppard & jewitt  @xcite ; agnor & hamilton  @xcite ; nesvorn et al .",
    "@xcite ,  @xcite ) .",
    "this means the irregular satellites may have close relationship with the formation of early solar system .",
    "they are smaller and farther , and having highly eccentric and inclined orbits than the regular satellites ( nicholson  @xcite ; grav et al .",
    "the astrometric observations of irregular satellites are also more difficult to be obtained with high precision . until now , though many space missions have had close flyby , observations made by ground - based telescopes could still be the primary way to study irregular satellites .",
    "the high precision astrometric observations of irregular satellites can also be used for improving the ephemerides of their host planets .",
    "himalia is the largest member of jovian irregular satellites ( grav et al .",
    "it has been discovered by perrine at lick observatory in 1904 ( perrine  @xcite ) .",
    "the astrometric observations of himalia were obtained continuously since then .",
    "the precision of positions of himalia was also improved steadily with the time after larger diameter telescopes and new astrometric data processing techniques were used . thus two medium size telescopes which are the 2.4 m telescope ( fan et al .",
    "@xcite ) and 1 m telescope ( zhou et al .",
    "@xcite ) administered by yunnan observatories were used for obtaining our ccd observations . for the data processing , in order to obtain high precision results , several factors were taken into account . specifically , the reference star catalogue used , the geometric distortion ( called gd hereafter ) and the phase effect , etc .",
    "the latest version of software routines from the iau - sofa ( international astronomical union - standards of fundamental astronomy ) collection ( hohenkerk  @xcite ) were used for calculating the topocentric apparent positions of reference stars .",
    "our previously proposed gd solution ( peng et al .",
    "@xcite ) was used for deriving the gd patterns .",
    "the gd effects of the 2.4 m and 1 m telescopes have been proved in our previous works ( peng et al .",
    "@xcite ,  @xcite ; zhang et al .",
    "@xcite ; wang et al .",
    "@xcite ; peng et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in consideration of the fewer number of reference stars in each ccd frame of himalia , the high - order plate model ca nt be applied . in some cases",
    ", there are only several reference stars available in the ccd field of view , and a plate model with four constants becomes the most reasonable choice . under this circumstance ,",
    "the gd effects should be corrected accurately .",
    "furthermore , the phase effect of himalia was also analyzed ( lindegren  @xcite ) .",
    "as is well known , the precision of a reference star catalogue is essential to the measurements of irregular satellites .",
    "furthermore , the zonal errors of a star catalogue also have direct influence on the positional precision . the astrometry satellite gaia ( gaia collaboration et al .",
    "@xcite ) which is fully funded by the european space agency ( esa ) has been launched on december 19 , 2013 . after less than three years , the first catalogue gaia data release 1 ( gaia dr1 ) ( gaia collaboration et al .",
    "@xcite ) was published on september 14 , 2016 .",
    "the precise star positions derived by the gaia could render better predictions with the primary source of error being the ephemerides ( de bruijne  @xcite ; gomes - jnior et al .",
    "though the final mission products are waiting to be released in the future , the results of gaia dr1 still represent a huge improvement in the available fundamental stellar data and practical definition of the optical reference frame ( lindegren et al .",
    "we believe that the higher positional precision of targets will be achieved .",
    "the contents of this paper are arranged as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the ccd observations are described .",
    "section 3 presents the reduction details . in section 4 , results are showed . in section 5 , discussions are made . finally , in section 6",
    ", conclusions are drawn .",
    "a total of 27 nights of ccd observations of himalia were obtained from two telescopes administered by yunnan observatories during the years 2015 - 2016 .",
    "the observational dates were chosen according to the epochs when jupiter is near its opposition .",
    "specifically , 19 nights of ccd observations were made by the yunnan faint object spectrograph and camera ( yfosc ) instrument attached to the 2.4 m telescope ( longitude e 100@xmath01@xmath151@xmath2 , latitude n 26@xmath042@xmath132@xmath2 , height 3193 m above sea level ) , and 9 nights of ccd observations were made by the 1 m telescope ( longitude e 102@xmath047@xmath118@xmath2 , latitude n 25@xmath01@xmath146@xmath2 , height 2000 m above sea level ) .",
    "it is noted that observations were obtained from both the 2.4 m and 1 m telescopes on february 12 , 2015 .",
    "the specifications of the two telescopes and corresponding ccd detectors are listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",

    "column 1 shows the parameters and the following columns list their values for the two telescopes . [ cols=\">,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this paper , a total of 598 ccd observations obtained from the 2.4 m and 1 m telescopes administered by yunnan observatories were processed .",
    "several factors were analyzed , including the reference star catalogue used , the geometric distortion and the phase effect .",
    "the reference star catalogue gaia dr1 and ucac4 were both used for astrometric reduction and have been made with comparisons .",
    "positional precision of himalia has been significantly improved after gd corrections .",
    "the systematic errors existing in the results by using ucac4 are significantly reduced after gaia dr1 was used .",
    "comparisons between the two different ephemerides which retrieved from jpl and imcce have been made .",
