    "t tau has been extensively studied from radio to ultraviolet wavelengths because it has long been considered the prototype of a class of pre - main sequence stars . in recent years",
    "it has become clear that t tau is in reality a very complex system and that it differs from other t tauri stars .",
    "it is in fact known to be a binary system ( dyck et al .",
    "1982 ) , containing an optical stellar component ( t tau n ) and an infrared companion 0.7 arcsec to the south ( t tau s ) , corresponding to 100 au at the 140 pc distance of the taurus auriga dark cloud ( wichmann et al . 1998 ) .",
    "t tau s dominates the bolometric luminosity of the system ( ghez et al .",
    "1991 ) , but it has no detectable optical counterpart to a limiting magnitude of v=19.6 , suggesting an optical extinction greater than 7 mag ( stapelfeldt et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "since herbig s ( 1950 ) optical spectra of burnham s nebula , surrounding t tau several arcsecond across , resembling a so - called hh object , it was clear that the interaction of stellar winds with the surrounding molecular medium is at work .",
    "molecular outflow activity was first mapped by edwards & snell ( 1982 ) in @xmath8co j=1 - 0 and j=2 - 1 , who found that 95% of the high velocity molecular gas is associated with blueshifted material .",
    "the direction of the detected outflow is roughly parallel to the line of sight , but the emission also shows a region extending 2 arcmin to the south and east of t tau n with a secondary peak in the blueshifted wing .",
    "higher resolution maps of the @xmath8co j=3 - 2 , j=6 - 5 and c@xmath9o j=1 - 0 , j=2 - 1 and hco@xmath10 emission later showed ( schuster et al .",
    "1993 , momose et al .",
    "1996 , schuster et al .",
    "1997 , hogerheijde et al .",
    "1998 ) a complex outflow system that could originate from the different components of the binary system .",
    "the fast stellar winds observed through forbidden optical line emission ( bhm & solf 1994 ) , revealed five distinct kinematic components that suggest that both the primary star and the companion may drive separate bipolar outflows . a giant herbig - haro flow was recently discovered ( reipurth et al .",
    "1997 ) around t tau and is interpreted as originating several thousand years ago from t tau s.    strong and extended @xmath11 ro - vibrational emission was found quite early around t tau ( beckwith et al .",
    "recently , high resolution @xmath11 imaging ( herbst et al . 1996 , 1997 ) indicated that the extended molecular hydrogen emission arises from the impact on the ambient cloud of two outflow systems oriented nw - se and e - w .",
    "these originate from the two stars , each with its circumstellar disk , and the emission is distributed equally over t tau n and t tau s. infrared adaptive optics observations in @xmath11 show instead that the emission is concentrated on t tau s and is interpreted in terms of shocks occurring as matter accretes onto the circumstellar disk of t tau s ( quirrenbach & zinnecker 1997 ) .",
    "no firm conclusion is therefore reached on this problem .",
    "t tau has associated a substantial amount of mass of dust , it is therefore luminous in the millimeter continuum ( adams et al .",
    "1990 , beckwith et al . 1990 ) .",
    "a circumstellar disk has been detected both with co interferometry and infrared scattered light ( weintraub et al .",
    "1989 , momose et al .",
    "later , millimeter continuum interferometry at 0.9 and 3 mm ( hogerheijde et al .",
    "1997 , akeson et al .",
    "1998 , respectively ) was used to derive a total mass of 0.04 @xmath12 for the circumstellar disk around t tau n and at least 10 times smaller for that associated to t tau s. a circumbinary envelope would also be required to fit the continuum energy distribution .",
    "far - infrared spectroscopy provides powerful diagnostic lines from abundant molecular species like co , h@xmath0o   and oh , that can be used to clarify the physical processes at work in the complex t tau system . in this paper we present the far - infrared spectrum observed from the long wavelength spectrometer ( lws , clegg et al .",
    "1996 ) onboard the infrared space observatory ( iso , kessler et al .",
    "additional data from the short wavelength spectrometer ( sws , de graauw et al .",
    "1996 ) are also used for discussing the molecular emission properties .",
    "the main results of the sws are presented by van den ancker et al.(1999 ) .",
    "the continuum far - infrared spectrum of t tau will be discussed in a forthcoming paper ( pezzuto et al . in preparation ) .",
    "t tau has been observed with iso ( infrared space observatory ) using the lws ( long wavelength spectrometer , clegg et al .",
    "1996 ) . a full low resolution",
    "( r @xmath2 200 ) spectrum of the source from 45 to 197 @xmath1 m was obtained during revolution 680 , corresponding to september , 25 , 1997 .",
    "the beamsize is on average 80 arcsec , depending on the wavelength .",
    "the spectrum was made up of 23 full grating scans oversampled at 1/4 of a resolution element , with each spectral sample integrated for 11.5 sec , with a total integration time of 4265 sec . besides the observation on - source , full grating spectra",
    "were also collected at four off - source positions . in table 1",
    "we present the journal of the lws observations , which includes source and off - source positions and total observing time ( ott ) .",
    "the raw data were reduced and calibrated using version 7 of the lws pipeline , which achieves an absolute accuracy of about 30 % ( swinyard et al .",
    "post - pipeline processing was carried out with the isap package and included removal of spurious signals due to cosmic ray impacts and averaging the grating scans of each detector .",
    "besides the data measured by the lws , we also discuss in this paper the detection of h@xmath0o   and oh emission lines observed by the sws .",
    "the details of these observations are reported by van den ancker et al.(1999 ) .",
    ".journal of the iso - lws observations of t tau [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     notes : @xmath13 : wavelength was fixed for deblending .",
    "the detection of [ cii]158@xmath1 m   in the four off - source positions around t tau ( see table 5 ) clearly shows that most of the ionized carbon emission ( @xmath14 ) is from an extended region and not originated in the vicinity of t tau .",
    "the intrinsic emission in the lws beam centered on t tau is about 2 @xmath15 10@xmath16 w @xmath17 .",
    "this implies a ratio [ oi]63@xmath1m/[cii]158@xmath1 m   of 115 , greatly in excess of that expected from photodissociation region models ( kaufman et  al.1999 ; burton et  al .",
    "1990 ) .",
    "finally the ratio of [ oi]63@xmath1m/145@xmath1m=28.3 is such that no oxygen self - absorption should occur , as it often appears to be the case towards pre - main sequence sources ( saraceno et al .",
    "this suggests that there is no cold gas in front of the source , in accordance with the geometry of the outflow directed towards the observer .",
    "as outlined in van den ancker et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , based on a larger set of fine - structure lines detected at shorter wavelengths , we argue that the atomic line emission observed is consistent with the presence of j - type dissociative shocks . on the other hand , the excess [ cii]158@xmath1 m   emission on - source could also be due to a local photodissociation region ( pdr ) , possibly originated from the far - uv field of t tau ( see sect .",
    "4 ) .      table 6 summarises the physical quantities derived from the observed molecular spectra of co , h@xmath0o   and oh , adopting the two models considered : the column densities and the total cooling luminosities are given for each molecular species .",
    "we also give the observed values of the cooling derived from the sum of all the detected fluxes . for deriving l@xmath18",
    ", we used the line fluxes reported in van den ancker et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and the line @xmath11 1 - 0 s(1 ) at 2.12@xmath1 m , given in carr ( 1990 ) .",
    "a comparison between the observed and modeled cooling shows that the observations of co , h@xmath0o   and oh can account for most of the modeled cooling .",
    "the underestimate of the oh cooling by the 900 k model confirms that this latter is probably inadeguate to explain the observed oh emission .",
    "the total radiated cooling observed from these species , including [ oi ] , sums up to about 0.04 l@xmath7 , and has to be considered as a lower limit .",
    "taking the outflow parameters from the literature ( levreault 1988 ; mundt 1984 ) we derive a total mechanical luminosity of about 0.05 l@xmath7 ( we have taken an average velocity of 10 @xmath19 , a total outflow mass of 0.22 m@xmath7 , and a dynamical timescale of 40,000 years ) . the radiative luminosity observed in the",
    "far - infrared is therefore comparable to the outflow mechanical luminosity .",
    "this is expected if the stellar winds from the stars are driving the outflows and the shocks , traced by the far - infrared lines , accelerate the ambient medium into the molecular outflow ( davis & eislffel 1995 ) .",

    "once the physical conditions of the emitting gas in the vicinity of t tau have been established , we can now proceed to compare the results with existing models of shock excitation .",
    "the far - infrared line emission of young stellar objects is mainly originated from two physical processes : the excitation from photoionized and photodissociated ( pdr ) regions ( tielens & hollenbach 1985 ) and the shock excitation produced by the interaction of supersonic winds with the ambient medium .",
    "depending on wind velocity , magnetic field and ion density , two kinds of shocks with different far - infrared spectra are predicted from models :    * high velocity dissociative j shocks ( e.g. hollenbach & mckee 1989 ) , in which temperature , density and velocity have a discontinuous jump ( j ) on the shock front , molecules are dissociated and atomic lines are the dominant coolants ; * low velocity non - dissociative c shocks ( e.g. kaufman & neufeld 1996 , draine et al . 1983 ) in which the ion alfvn velocity is larger than the shock velocity and the magnetic field transmits energy faster than the shock velocity ; in this case temperature , density and velocity have a continuous ( c ) variation and molecules are the dominant coolants .    instead of using intensities of many tens of different lines , we can obtain a better comparison between our data and the shock model predictions using the total cooling from a single species .",
    "in fig.7 we show the water cooling as a function of the [ oi]63@xmath1 m   cooling , both normalized to the high - j co cooling .",
    "the c - type shock models of kaufman & neufeld ( 1996 ) are considered .",
    "the j - type shock models ( hollenbach & mckee 1989 ) are also indicated ( see figure caption for details ) . together with the position of t tau , we also show in this figure the positions of l1448 ( nisini et al .",
    "1999b ) , ic1396 ( saraceno et al .",
    "1999 ) , iras16293 - 2422 ( ceccarelli et al .",
    "1998 ) , and the herbig - haro objects hh54 ( liseau et al . 1996 ) , hh25 and hh26 ( benedettini et al . 1998 ) .",
    "t tau is in a central position , showing that both c - type and j - type shock models could explain the observations .",
    "it has to be noted , however , that according to kaufman & neufeld models , its position implies a shock velocity between 10 and @xmath34 , in a range where water production is triggered but it is not at its maximum efficiency .",
    "we can see in the figure that other pre - main sequence sources also cluster in the same region of t tau , indicating that these shock conditions are fairly common in the environment of young stellar objects ( nisini et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "8 shows the water cooling as a function of the oh cooling , both normalized to the high - j co cooling . as before",
    ", we consider both j - type and c - type shocks .",
    "the position of t tau in this plot appears to be consistent with j - type shocks .",
    "the main reason why c - shocks fail to reproduce the observed cooling is the overabundance of oh molecules , by at least a factor 10 .",
    "only a model which includes the effects of the presence of a high uv field from t tau itself can reproduce the observed values .    fig .",
    "9 shows the water cooling as a function of the @xmath11 cooling , both normalized to the high - j co cooling .",
    "t tau lies exactly in the center of the region of c - type shocks and can not be explained by j - type shocks .",
    "as expected , the strong h@xmath0 emission can not be accounted for by j - type shocks .",
    "we therefore rule out the hypothesis that the major responsible of the observed excitation are j - shocks .",
    "because photodissociation of water by an uv field , that is not included in shock models , can convert water to oh , we suppose that the overabundance of the oh molecule is due only to the strong far - uv radiation field associated to t tau ( herbig & goodrich , 1986 ) . the photodissociation cross sect . of water at the @xmath35 frequency is in fact ten times larger than the one of oh ( van dishoeck & dalgarno 1984 ) . a similar situation has been found in supernova remnants , where oh 1720 mhz emission is explained as originated from c - type shocks , allowing that the action of an uv field creates sufficient oh from water dissociation ( wardle et al .",
    "1998 ; lockett et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "if this is the case , the far - infrared molecular emission spectrum of t tau is primarily due to c - type shocks . to reconcile the oh observations with c - type shock models we need that the oh abundance , and thus its total cooling , were reduced by a factor 10 in favor of water cooling . from table 6",
    ", if we reduce by a factor 10 the oh column density and we increase of the corresponding amount that one of the water , passing from @xmath28 to @xmath36 , we will increase the total water cooling by a factor of about 3 .",
    "increasing the water cooling by this factor and decreasing the oh cooling by a factor 10 would move the position of t tau in the three diagrams of fig.7 , 8 and 9 in positions fully consistent with c - type shock models ( see the open triangles in the figures ) , at pre - shock densities of about 10@xmath37 @xmath38 and shock velocities of @xmath39 . comparing the pre - shock densities of these models with the densities derived from our lvg models , we found that a moderate compression factor ( @xmath40 10 ) would be required . in support of the fact that the molecular emission is due to c - type shocks",
    "is the evidence of the presence of strong magnetic fields in the outflow region associated with t tau s ( ray et al . 1997 ) .",
    "our conclusion that the observed far - infrared molecular emission from t tau can be explained by c - type shocks and that the atomic emission is probably originated in j - type shocks is in agreement with the findings of van den ancker et al .",
    "their models , based on the near to mid - infrared @xmath11 emission imply two temperature components at 440 k and 1500 k , which again are roughly in agreement with our finding of two components : one ranging from 300 k to 900 k and another at an higher temperature traced by the higher @xmath41 co transitions .    as to the origin of the c - type shocks , responsible for the observed far - infrared molecular emission , we know from the lvg models that the emission region has a size of only few hundreds au , assuming a spherical geometry .",
    "this implies that the shocks occur in a very compact region , presumably very close to the binary system .",
    "there are at least three mechanisms not mutually exclusive to explain the origin of the shocks :    1 .   from the interaction region of winds coming from the two stars ; 2 .   from disk accretion on the youngest component of the binary system ; 3 .   from the interaction of the stellar wind with the molecular material in the circumstellar envelope .",
    "the first possibility seems the best one for originating fast ( @xmath42 ) dissociative j - type shocks , because the wind interaction would occur close to the stars where velocities are supposed to be high and the stellar field strong to dissociate molecules .",
    "the second possibility has already been suggested by quirrenbach & zinnecker ( 1997 ) to explain the near - infrared @xmath11 extended emission .",
    "the third one is probably at work in any case , because it is needed to explain the strong emission from co , h@xmath0o , oh , as well as that from @xmath11 ( van den ancker et al .",
    "to summarise our results , we list the main findings of this study :    1 .",
    "the far - infrared spectrum associated to the binary system of t tau shows strong emission from co , h@xmath0o   and oh molecules . 2 .",
    "optically thin co emission lines from high - j transitions are used to constrain the physical regimes of the gas : t@xmath2300 - 900 k and n@xmath310@xmath4@xmath5 .",
    "the detection of co lines with @xmath41 of 24 and 25 seems to indicate that a warmer component is also needed .",
    "h@xmath0o   and oh emission is consistent with such conditions ,",
    "however the higher excitation lines at the shorter wavelenghs are not well fitted by these models , indicating that higher temperature gas should also be present , in agreement with the co emission .",
    "4 .   from the assumption that all the far - infrared molecular emission observed originate from the same region a very compact size of 300 - 400 au of diameter is derived . 5 .",
    "the detection of [ cii]158@xmath1 m   off - source at large distances from t tau shows that most of the ionised carbon emission ( @xmath14 ) is from an extended region and not originated in the vicinity of t tau .",
    "the intrinsic emission in the lws beam centered on t tau implies a ratio [ oi]63@xmath1m/[cii]158@xmath1 m   of 115 , much in excess of what is expected from photodissociation region models .",
    "this emission is probably due to j - type shocks , however it is not ruled out the possibility of a contamination by a pdr .",
    "the total cooling observed in the various species is comparable to the mechanical luminosity of the outflow , indicating that the stellar winds could be the ultimate responsible of the line excitation through shocks .",
    "the study of the cooling from the main radiative components ( [ oi ] , co , h@xmath0o , oh and @xmath11 ) is used to show that our data are consistent with c - type shock models , only if we assume an overabundance of the oh molecule ( by a factor 10 ) probably due to the intense far - ultraviolet radiation field .",
    "we finally consider the origin of the shocks responsible for the far - infrared emission : colliding winds from the components of the binary system , disk accretion in the more embedded star and wind interaction with the molecular ambient cloud . due to the large beam size of the lws instrument , we are unable to specify which of the processes is the dominant one .",
    "we wish to thank the lws consortium and the iso staff at vilspa ( esa , villafranca , spain ) for having operated the lws instrument and the iso satellite .",
    "we thank riccardo cesaroni for running his oh code to evaluate the effects of a local radiation field .",

    "<S> the first complete far - infrared spectrum of t tau has been obtained with the lws spectrometer on - board the infrared space observatory ( iso ) , which detected strong emission from high - j ( j=14 - 25 ) co , para- and ortho - h@xmath0o and oh transitions over the wavelength range from 40 to 190 @xmath1 m . </S>",
    "<S> in addition the [ oi]63@xmath1 m , [ oi]145@xmath1 m   and [ cii]158@xmath1 m   atomic lines were also detected . most of the observed molecular emission can be explained by a single emission region at t@xmath2300 - 900 k and n@xmath310@xmath4@xmath5 , with a diameter of about 2 - 3 arcsec . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to a very compact region of 300 - 400 au at the distance of 140 pc . </S>",
    "<S> an higher temperature component seems to be needed to explain the highest excitation co and h@xmath0o   lines . </S>",
    "<S> we derive a water abundance of 1 - 7 @xmath6 and an oh abundance of @xmath2 3@xmath6 with respect to molecular hydrogen , implying h@xmath0o   and oh enhancements by more than a factor of 10 with respect to the expected ambient gas abundance .    </S>",
    "<S> the observed cooling in the various species amounts to 0.04 l@xmath7 , comparable to the mechanical luminosity of the outflow , indicating that the stellar winds could be responsible of the line excitation through shocks .    in order to explain the observed molecular cooling in t tau in terms of c - type shock models , we hypothesise that the strong far - ultraviolet radiation field photodissociates water in favour of oh . </S>",
    "<S> this would explain the large overabundance of oh observed .    </S>",
    "<S> the estimated relatively high density and compactness of the observed emission suggest that it originates from the shocks taking place at the base of the molecular outflow emission , in the region where the action of the stellar winds from the two stars of the binary system is important . </S>"
