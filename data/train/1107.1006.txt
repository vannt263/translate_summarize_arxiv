    "experimental investigations of he dimers and trimers @xcite in the 1990 s generated considerable theoretical interest in these weakly - bound few - body systems .",
    "small he clusters are now considered one of the most extensively studied molecules  theoretically and computationally @xcite ( see also an extensive review @xcite ) .",
    "many semi - empirical and ab initio potential models have been proposed for the interaction of he atoms@xcite .",
    "these potential models have been used as input in a number of two- three- and even four- body quantum calculations@xcite .",
    "the numerical results of these investigations are , for the most part , in agreement , with small remaining discrepancies due simply to limits of numerical accuracy .",
    "nevertheless , we wish to revisit , reproduce and check these previous results .",
    "while small clusters of he are structurally quite simple , they are also delicate , with very weak binding , and so are challenging to model numerically . given the extensive set of known potential models and the number of results published , it seems natural to use bound and scattering states of two and three he atoms to benchmark the accuracy of existing and future few - body quantum - chemical software .",
    "the near - threshold state of the he dimer is extremely sensitive to the details of the interaction potential .",
    "visually indistinguishable potentials can lead to qualitatively different expectations for the properties of the he dimer .",
    "the three - body states are likewise expected to be very sensitive to the details of the interaction , since their binding is similar to that of efimov states .",
    "one immediate result of our investigations is that , even for a fixed potential , he cluster observables can vary substantially depending on the accuracy of the fundamental constants used in the calculations . unfortunately , the fundamental constants and conversion factors published by the developers of potential models and early he cluster calculations  and , therefore , widely used in subsequent publications  have intrinsic systematic errors that prevent them from being used for benchmark purposes .    in this paper , we consider three questions : to what extent is the accuracy of near - threshold calculations limited by knowledge of the fundamental constants ? to what extent can the known discrepancies in the published results be explained by possible use of inexact coupling constants ? can our three - body calculations reach the `` natural '' accuracy limit set by the uncertainties of the known fundamental constants ? answers to these questions will allow us to benchmark a quantum few - body code being prepared for public release , with intended applications to a wider variety of atomic and molecular few - body systems .",
    "the detailed technical description of the three - body code we use for the calculations will be made elsewhere ; generally , the techniques used in these calculations are similar to the ones employed in @xcite . in the current stage of development",
    "the code is not yet completely ready for an extensive public distribution .",
    "interested readers , however , are encouraged to contact the authors for obtaining the current development version .",
    "we assume throughout this paper that the system of he atoms can be described by a single - channel pairwise interaction .",
    "we , therefore ignore the contribution of three - body forces .",
    "this contribution can , substantially exceed the numerical accuracy of the calculations presented .",
    "our goal , however , is to provide an exemplary data set based on known potential models rather than to perform the most realistic calculation of the physical system .",
    "we also ignore all the off - diagonal non - adiabatic corrections not included in the single - channel potential model .    in the following sections we shall give a short description of the problem ,",
    "analyze the uncertainties that enter the benchmarking problem , give a review of published results and provide our results , which account for all known physical uncertainties .",
    "consider the schrdinger equation for a two - body system @xmath5 here , @xmath6 is a conversion factor between the energy units of the potential ( provided by the various developers of two - body potentials ) and our chosen `` natural '' units , as specified below .",
    "this conversion factor , specified with varying degree of precision by different authors , is usually a simple function of fundamental constants . rescaling the energy we reduce the equation to @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 . to analyze the sensitivity of the state @xmath10 to the inaccuracy of the fundamental constants and other conversion factors , we introduce a ( dimensionless ) coupling constant @xmath11 and treat the eigenvalue @xmath12 as a function of the coupling constant @xmath13 knowing the derivative of the energy eigenvalue @xmath14 one can estimate the sensitivity of the dimer bound state , or scattering phase shifts , to the degree of precision of the fundamental constants of interest .",
    "many model potentials of rare gas atom interactions were published in units of temperature .",
    "the conversion factors between atomic units of energy ( typically employed in calculations ) and temperature units are , however , not always provided . in some cases , when the corresponding conversion factors are published , the values suggested by the authors differ significantly from the values recommended by nist . for instance",
    ", the recommended value for the tty potential is 3.1669@xmath1510@xmath16  a.u .",
    "k@xmath17 , which differs from the recommended value of 3.1668154@xmath1510@xmath16  a.u .",
    "k@xmath17 in the 5th significant figure .",
    "even such small differences can appreciably affect the accuracy of derived results owing to the weakly - bound nature of few - body clusters , and can make benchmarking and comparison of alternative computational strategies difficult .",
    "many three - body calculations of he clusters @xcite have been performed , assuming    for distance and the conversion coefficient @xmath18  @xmath19k .",
    "keeping only 4 significant figures may lead , however , to significant inaccuracy in 2-body observables .",
    "let us estimate the accuracy of this coupling constant based on the best available data from the nist database .",
    "based on the following recommended values @xmath20",
    "@xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 the value of the conversion factor for two @xmath1he atoms should be taken as @xmath24@xmath19 .",
    "the major source of the uncertainty in this conversion factor is the boltzmann constant , followed by the planck constant and the mass unit .",
    "the results of our calculations of the binding energy and effective range expansion parameters for two he atoms are summarized in table  [ tab : twobodylowenergyparameters ] . for conversion of energy between k and atomic units",
    "we use the value of the boltzmann constant @xmath25 we provide two types of results .",
    "the first group of calculations is performed with the effective coupling constant used in previous three - body calculations , the second type is done with the best values recommended by nist .",
    "the calculations are done in atomic units . for conversion between k and a.u .",
    "( the factor `` c '' discussed above ) we also use the values recommended by nist .",
    "this explains the difference between the values reported here and previously published results for the tty potential .",
    ".binding energy and effective range parameters for different potential models calculated for exact and approximate effective coupling constants .",
    "relative effect of rounding the coupling constant is given in parentheses . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     similarly to the case of the symmetric bosonic trimer , we have plotted the ratio of the @xmath26he-@xmath1he@xmath2 atom - dimer scattering length to the @xmath0he-@xmath0he scattering length as a function of the dimensionless parameter @xmath27 which characterizes the distance between the two - body threshold and the pole of the three - body t - matrix corresponding to the unsymmetric trimer bound state .",
    "all the data consistently follow the same trend ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : unsymmtrend ] ) .",
    "he-@xmath1he@xmath2 atom - dimer scattering length ( in units of the @xmath0he-@xmath0he scattering length ) as a function of the distance to the pole in the three - body t - matrix .",
    "the difference between the results obtained with exact and inexact coupling constants is clearly resolved and consistent with the overall trend.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]",
    "we have performed highly accurate calculations of the system of three he atoms , including both symmetric and unsymmetric cases .",
    "we have studied the effects of small ( 0.006% ) variations of the interaction coupling constant on the energies of he dimer and trimer bound states and scattering lengths .",
    "results of the calculations reported here are converged to 5 significant figures for the most of the observables .",
    "all the results are consistent with previously published calculations and follow the same universal  potential independent  trend .",
    "we can summarize the sensitivity of the results to small inaccuracies in the coupling constant as follows : a 0.006% variation of the coupling constant induces 0.5% shift in the energy of the dimer , 0.3% shift in the energy of the excited state of the homogeneous trimer and the single bound state of the inhomogeneous trimer , 0.2% shift in the @xmath0he-@xmath0he atom - atom scattering length , 0.06%-0.15% shift in the @xmath0he-@xmath1he@xmath2 atom - dimer scattering length , 0.08% shift in the energy of the ground state of the homogeneous trimer , and 0.03% shift in the scattering length for @xmath26he-@xmath1he@xmath2 collisions . as the effective coupling constant for the potentials reported in units of temperature",
    "is known with the relative accuracy of 0.0002% , the physical limit for the accuracy of the binding energy of the he dimer , the excited state of homogeneous he trimer and the energy of the inhomogeneous he trimer is about 5 significant figures .",
    "this accuracy is achieved in the present calculations performed with a computer program being prepared for a public release .",
    "the authors hope that both the qualitative observations and the numerical results reported in this work can be used in the future for benchmarking various quantum few - body codes .",
    "this work is supported by the nsf grant phy-0903956 .",
    "we wish to thank dr .",
    "kolganova ( jinr , dubna ) for stimulating discussions and independent preliminary testing of the three - body code .",
    "here we provide a very brief overview of our approach to solving the faddeev equations numerically . more detailed and rigorous description of the equations and",
    "the numerical approach is being prepared as a separate publication .    according to the faddeev formalism @xcite the wave function of three particles",
    "is expressed in terms of faddeev components @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are jacobi coordinates corresponding to the fixed pair @xmath32 @xmath33 here @xmath34 are the positions of the particles in the center - of - mass frame .",
    "the faddeev components obey the set of three equations @xmath35 where @xmath36 stands for the pairwise potential and @xmath37 is the kinetic energy of the three particles .",
    "to make this system of equations suitable for numerical calculations one should take into account the symmetries of the physical system . as far as all the model potentials are central it is possible to factor out the degrees of freedom corresponding to the rotations of the whole cluster @xcite . for the case of zero total angular momentum",
    "the reduced faddeev equation reads @xmath38 here @xmath39 , @xmath40 and the coordinate transformations between different system of jacobi coordinates follow from the definition of the jacobi coordinates ( [ eq : jacoord ] ) .",
    "the asymptotic boundary condition for bound states consists of two terms @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the two - body bound state wave function , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the energy of the two - body bound state and @xmath46 is the energy of the three - body system .",
    "the second term  which corresponds to virtual decay of the three body bound state into three free particles  decreases much faster than the first one which corresponds to virtual decay into a particle and a two - body cluster . in our calculations",
    "we neglect the second term in the asymptotic introducing the following approximate boundary conditions for the faddeev component at sufficiently large distances @xmath47 and @xmath48 @xmath49    in order to solve the equations numerically we introduce a basis of hermit splines satisfying the boundary conditions ( [ bc ] ) and use orthogonal collocations to calculate a discrete matrix analog of the faddeev operator @xmath50 more detailed description of the discretization procedure can be found in @xcite ( see also @xcite where we describe the procedure of constructing optimal non - uniform grids automatically ) .",
    "we solve the system of linear equations iteratively exploiting factorability of the left - hand side of eqs .",
    "( [ fadd3 ] ) for preconditioning .",
    "in particular , we introduce localized components @xmath51 which  due to the asymtotic properties of the faddeev components  has much better spacial localization than the original faddeev component .",
    "the equations for the localized component read @xmath52 the transformation ( [ eq : tau ] ) makes it possible to reduce the rank of the linear system essentially , typically by a factor of 3 .",
    "application of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lcfadd ] ) to atom - dimer scattering can be found in @xcite .",
    "a similar idea has been discussed in @xcite .",
