    "plasma tails of comets and their time variations potentially provide crucial information on solar winds and magnetic fields in the solar system ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "short - time variations in plasma tails , however , are not yet fully understood .",
    "indeed , most previous studies observed tails and structures at far distances ( @xmath3 km from the nucleus ) with a time resolution of an order of an hour .    regarding the speed of movement along the tail , @xcite studied 72 disconnection events ( des ) of various comet tails and found @xmath4 100 km s@xmath2 at @xmath5 km from the nuclei .",
    "their initial speeds before des are around 44 km s@xmath2 and the typical acceleration is 21 cm s@xmath6 .",
    "@xcite analyzed a knot in the plasma tail of comet 1p / halley and derived its average velocity of 58 km s@xmath2 at 49 @xmath1 km from the nucleus .",
    "@xcite observed c/1996 b2(hyakutake ) and measured the speed of a knot of 99.2 km s@xmath2 at 5.0 @xmath7 km from the nucleus . @xcite investigated de of c/1995 o1 ( hale - bopp ) and obtained the speed of @xmath0 500 km s@xmath2 at @xmath0 7@xmath8 km from the nucleus .",
    "@xcite analyzed several knots in comets c/2001 q4(neat ) and c/2002 t7(linear ) using the solar mass ejection imager .",
    "they found the speed to be 50100 km s@xmath2 around @xmath9 km from the nucleus .",
    "these previous studies did not catch the moment immediately after the formation of knots or the detachment of knots from the tail .",
    "the initial speed at these critical times was only an extrapolation from later observations relatively far away . in this letter , we report detections of knots in the plasma tail 3@xmath1 km away from the nucleus of c/2013 r1(lovejoy ) and a direct measurement of their initial motions .",
    "we adopt the ab magnitude system throughout the paper .",
    "the comet was observed on 2013 december 4 ( ut ) using the subaru prime focus camera ( suprime - cam ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) mounted on the subaru telescope at mauna kea ( observatory code 568 ) .",
    "the camera consists of a 5 @xmath10 2 array of 2k @xmath10 4k ccds .",
    "the pixel scale is 0.202 arcsec pixel@xmath2 .",
    "the field of view is about 35@xmath1028 arcmin .",
    "we used two broadband filters : w - c - ic ( i - band : center=7970  , full width at half maximum ( fwhm)=1400 ) and w - j - v ( v - band : center=5470  , fwhm=970 ) filters .",
    "both bands trace the plasma tail .",
    "i - band includes predominantly h@xmath11o@xmath12 line emissions , while v - band includes co@xmath12 and h@xmath11o@xmath12 line emissions .",
    "the observation log is given in table [ tab : obslog ] .",
    "the total observing time of 24 minutes was spent after main science targets of the observing run were set .",
    "the start time of the exposures have an uncertainty of about 1 second . the position angle and",
    "the pointing offset were adopted to catch the comet nucleus at the bottom - left corner and to have the tail run diagonally across the field - of - view so that the maximum extent of the tail is framed in each exposure .",
    "the subaru telescope s non - sidereal tracking mode@xcite was used so that the comet was always observed at the same position on the ccd array . for the observing run",
    ", the comet s coordinates were calculated using the nasa / jpl horizons system with the orbit element of jpl#22 .",
    "we used an ephemeris of one - minute step .",
    "unfortunately , the values of jpl#22 were not recorded . in the following , we instead used newer orbital elements ( jpl#55 ) .",
    "the values are given in table [ tab : orbit ] .",
    "the positions calculated from jpl#22 and jpl#55 have an offset by 0.34 arcsec in right ascension and -1.88 arcsec in declination but show no drift during the observation .",
    "the offset of the absolute celestial coordinate does not affect in this study , since our analysis is on relative position of structures inside of the comet . at the time of the observations ,",
    "the observercentric and heliocentric distance to the comet were 0.55230.5526 and 0.88120.8811 au , respectively . in the sky projection ,",
    "the conversion from the angular to the physical scales was 400.6400.8 km arcsec@xmath2 . considering the phase angle ( sun - target - observer angle ) of 83.5 degrees at the time of the observations",
    ", we adopt the physical scale along the tail of 403.3 km arcsec@xmath2 in the following discussion .",
    "the heliocentric ecliptic coordinate of the comet nucleus was ( @xmath13,@xmath14)=(87.5,30.7 ) .",
    "the comet was located before the perihelion passage , and its heliocentric velocity was -12.6 km s@xmath2 .    the seeing size is estimated from short ( two - second ) exposures and was 1.0 and 1.1 arcsec in i and v - bands , respectively .",
    "the movement of the comet in the celestial coordinate was about ( dra@xmath10cos(d)/dt , d(d)/dt)=(283 ",
    "284,-115 ) arcsec hr@xmath2 during the observations . due to the non - sidereal tracking ,",
    "stars move in an exposure , but this motion does not affect the measurement of the seeing size significantly since the shift is only about 0.17 arcsec in a two - second exposure .    the data was reduced in a standard manner ; the steps include overscan subtraction , crosstalk correction @xcite , flat fielding using twilight flat , and distortion correction .",
    "the relative flux and relative position among the ccds are calibrated using other dithered datasets taken in the same night . the mosaicked image of v1 ( table [ tab : obslog ] )",
    "is shown as figure [ fig : v1 ] as an example .",
    "the flux was calibrated against stars in the field using the eighth data release of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss dr8 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) catalog in the same way as in @xcite .",
    "we first used sextractor @xcite for object detection in the suprime - cam images and astrometric calibration was performed to the center of the elongated stars against the guide star catalog 2.3.3 @xcite .",
    "then , we measured aperture fluxes at each position of sdss star whose r - band magnitude is 16@xmath15r@xmath1520 .",
    "the aperture radius was 40 , 50 , and 60 pixels , and we used @xmath16\\ ] ] as the background - corrected aperture flux of an elongated star , where @xmath17 is the aperture flux of @xmath18 radius .",
    "photometric zero point was estimated from the instrument flux @xmath19 and the catalog magnitude converted to the suprime - cam ab system .",
    "the color conversion coefficients from sdss to suprime - cam magnitudes are given in table [ tab : colorcoeff ] .",
    "the k - correct @xcite v4 offset for sdss is applied ; @xmath20=0.012 , 0.010 and 0.028 for @xmath21 , @xmath18 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "the number of stars used for calibration was @xmath23 in v and @xmath24 in i. the measured photometric zero - point of chip 2 ( reference chip ) was 27.36(i ) and 27.15(v ) ab mag per 1 adu s@xmath2 , and the peak - to - peak variation among exposures were smaller than 0.02 mag in each band .",
    "these zero points are comparable to the ones derived typically under photometric conditions , and thus we regard the data as having been obtained under photometric conditions .",
    "to investigate the fine structures in the plasma tail , additional image processing was applied .",
    "first , we rotate the image counterclockwise by 50 degrees so that the plasma tail aligns to the y - axis , and the region around the plasma tail within full width of 1000 pixels ( 3.4 arcmin ) was extracted .",
    "the position angle of the image to the north is the same among the nine images ( 160.0 degree ) . in the coordinate ,",
    "the sun lay in the direction of ( x , y)=(-0.014,+1.000 ) .",
    "the nuclei position was measured in short exposures ( i2 and v2 ) .",
    "the relative positional consistency among the images depends on the accuracy of the non - sidereal tracking mode of the subaru telescope . as we used the ephemeris of a one - minute step ,",
    "enough accuracy is guaranteed .",
    "we then applied an unsharp masking technique to each image ; we convolved the extracted images with various sizes of gaussian filter ( @xmath25=10 , 20 , 30 , 50 , 75 pixels ) and subtracted the smoothed image from the original ones .",
    "the details are presented in appendix a. this processing removes larger structures and enhances fine structures . to differentiate the processing with different kernel sizes , we refer to each as highpass@xmath26 ,",
    "e.g. , highpass10 when processed with the gaussian with @xmath25=10 pixels .",
    "bright stars in the background contaminate small features associated physically with the cometary tail ( e.g. , knots ) , and hence , we iteratively masked them . finally , we binned the image by 5@xmath105 pixels ( 1.01 arcsec square ) .",
    "figure [ fig : knots ] shows six longer - exposure images after the processing .",
    "these images show the gaps between ccd chips as gray bands .",
    "brightening / darkening around chip edges are artifacts .",
    "these do not affect the following analyses .",
    "we can visually see two knots moved downstream around the distance of @xmath0 3@xmath1 km from the nucleus ( indicated by arrows in figure [ fig : knots ] ) .",
    "the closeup images are shown as figure [ fig : closeup ] .",
    "one of the knots first appears to be connected to the global filamentary structures running along the tail .",
    "it later becomes detached from the structures .",
    "the positions of the knots are measured by running sextractor @xcite on the 5@xmath105 binned unsharp masked images .",
    "we measured in highpass30 , highpass50 , highpass70 , and highpass90 images .",
    "as examined in appendix b , an unsharp masking with a smaller kernel may introduce larger positional errors .",
    "meanwhile , the knot may not be detected after an unsharp masking with a large kernel because it is buried in global features .",
    "we therefore adopted the position from the largest kernel in which the peak of the knot is detected .",
    "the root mean squares ( rms ) of the position was @xmath27 km .",
    "distances from the nucleus ( along the tail ; y - axis ) and offsets from the tail axis ( perpendicular to the tail ; x - axis ) are plotted as a function of time in figure [ fig : speed ] .",
    "20 and 25 km s@xmath2 along the tail and 3.8 and 2.2 km s@xmath2 across the tail , respectively . the motion should make the shape of the knots elongated in a two - minute exposure by 67 arcsec along the tail and 1.3 or 0.7 arcsec across the tail . since the size of the knots is at least 1015 arcsec in diameter , elongation by the motion had little effect on the size estimation .",
    "these knot motions show tilts from the central axis of the tail by about 0.10.2 radians ( 611 degrees ) .",
    "we note that the direction to the sun is 0.014 radians ( 0.8 degrees ) from the axis , and therefore , the knot motions are not in a perfect alignment to the direction to the sun .    the distances to the knots from the nucleus change",
    "almost linearly with time in figure [ fig : speed ] .",
    "the effect of acceleration is therefore small in the short duration of our observations ( 23 minutes ) .",
    "the clear detection of the spatial motions , however , indicates the potential for direct measurements of the acceleration in future .",
    "if we can take the accelerations of previous measurements of other comets by @xcite ( 21 cm s@xmath6 ) , the expected change in the speed is only 0.3 km s@xmath2 in 23 minutes .",
    "if we adopt 17 cm s@xmath6 , which is calculated from figure 4 of @xcite as 2.4 km s@xmath2 increment is seen in four hours , the expected change in the speed during our observation is even smaller ( 0.2 km s@xmath2 ) .",
    "therefore , a sequence of few hours observations of a knot would permit us to measure the acceleration .",
    "we found that the width of the plasma tail also rapidly changed . in the analysis , the original images before the unsharp masking were used . in figure",
    "[ fig : itail ] and figure [ fig : width ] show spatial surface brightness profiles across the tail and their time variation .",
    "since we have measured the motions of the knots ( presumably the motion of the tail ) , we can track the variation in the tail width at a comoving position as the tail would flow at the speed of @xmath0 22 km s@xmath2 . in a sequence of images ( i1 , i3 , and i4 ) , we measured a profile at the distance of 6@xmath1010@xmath28 km in i1 .",
    "we then tracked the location of the material initially at this distance , but at later times using the flow speed , and plotted the profiles of ( presumably ) the same material in i3 and i4 .",
    "the tail width is determined at the surface brightness of 21.3 ab magnitude arcsec@xmath6 in i - band .",
    "it narrowed from 2.4@xmath29 to 2.0@xmath29 , and then to 1.8@xmath29 km for i1 , i3 , and i4 , respectively .    from this measurement ,",
    "the speed of the narrowing motion across the tail is @xmath0 8 km s@xmath2 at each edge .",
    "the center of the light distribution , meanwhile , did not show any notable change ( figure [ fig : width ] ) .",
    "this narrowing speed is larger than those of the knots in the same direction perpendicular to the tail ( 3.8 and 2.2 km s@xmath2 ; section [ sec : knots ] ) .",
    "this apparent difference could be attributed to a projection of the motion of the knots in the sky .",
    "if we assume every fine structure ( filamentary structure ) in the tail is moving at @xmath0 8 km s@xmath2 perpendicular to the tail , the amount of spatial shift would be about 2.5 arcsec within the 120-second exposures .",
    "on the other hand , the fine structures appear to be a typical 5 10 arc sec width in short exposures ( i2 , v2 ) .",
    "therefore , the blur due to the motions during a single 120-second exposure should not affect the positional measurements of the structures much .",
    "the initial speeds of two moving knots ( @xmath0 22 km s@xmath2 ) are significantly slower than the ones measured by @xcite ( 44 km s@xmath2 ; rms of 10.9 km s@xmath2 ) .",
    "this speed is also smaller than that measured in comet halley by @xcite ( 58 km s@xmath2 ) , who suggested that the velocity was constant at 49 @xmath1 km from the nucleus .",
    "though it is not clear what the dominant factor of the initial speed of knots is , we can compare several parameters of the comets .",
    "as the data used by @xcite include information from various comets , we compare parameters with the single case of the comet halley by @xcite . at the observation by @xcite , the heliocentric distance to comet",
    "halley was 1.016 au , the heliocentric ecliptic coordinate was ( @xmath13,@xmath14)=(30.1,8.8 ) , and the heliocentric velocity was -26.5 km s@xmath2 . compared with c/2013 r1(lovejoy ) in this study , a part of the difference in the initial speed may be explained by the difference in the heliocentric velocity of the nucleus , -12.6 km s@xmath2 versus -26.5 km s@xmath2 , if we assume that the initial speed of the knots might be comparable in heliocentric frame . it",
    ", however , does not fully explain @xmath0 40 km s@xmath2 difference .",
    "another difference is heliocentric ecliptic latitude , 30.7 vs 8.8 , which may result in the difference in the speed of the solar wind at the comet position .",
    "yet another point is that we have compared the speeds of our relatively faint and small knots with more prominent knots / kinks and des in the previous studies .",
    "the relevance of this comparison might be debated in light of future studies .",
    "in addition , we analyzed only one comet tail observed in a relatively short duration .",
    "a more systematic investigation is obviously needed as to the distribution of the initial speed of the tail as a function of the heliocentric velocity , the heliocentric distance , and the ecliptic position of the comet .    in summary",
    ", we found two knots that were just formed at 3@xmath1 km from the nucleus of c/2013 r1(lovejoy ) .",
    "their initial speed was smaller than the ones measured in previous studies , and a physical interpretation requires a more statistically significant sample at various heliocentric positions .",
    "we also found a rapid variation in the tail width in seven minutes , which implies a rapid change in ambient solar winds and magnetic field .",
    "these results strongly suggest that the variations in comet plasma tails , especially in their fine structures , require high time resolution observations with a large aperture telescope such as subaru .",
    "this work is based on observations obtained with the subaru telescope .",
