    "the dramatic recent progress by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) and other experiments @xcite measuring the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) has made non - cmb experiments even more important in the quest to constrain cosmological models and their free parameters .",
    "these non - cmb constraints are crucially needed for breaking cmb degeneracies @xcite ; for instance , wmap alone is consistent with a closed universe with hubble parameter @xmath18 and no cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "as long as the non - cmb constraints are less reliable and precise than the cmb , they will be the limiting factor and weakest link in the precision cosmology endeavor .",
    "much of the near - term progress in cosmology will therefore be driven by reductions in statistical and systematic uncertainties of non - cmb probes of the cosmic expansion history ( e.g. , sn ia ) and the matter power spectrum ( e.g. , lyman @xmath19 forest , galaxy clustering and motions , gravitational lensing , cluster studies and 21 cm tomography ) .",
    "the cosmological constraining power of three - dimensional maps of the universe provided by galaxy redshift surveys has motivated ever more ambitious observational efforts such as the cfa / uzc @xcite , lcrs @xcite , pscz @xcite , deep @xcite , 2dfgrs @xcite and sdss @xcite projects , resulting in progressively more accurate measurements of the galaxy power spectrum @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "constraints on cosmological models from these data sets have been most robust when the galaxy clustering could be measured on large scales where one has confidence in the modeling of nonlinear clustering and biasing ( , @xcite ) .",
    "our goal in this paper therefore is to measure @xmath0 on large scales using the sdss galaxy redshift survey in a way that is maximally useful for cosmological parameter estimation , and to explore the resulting constraints on cosmological models",
    ". the emphasis of our cosmological analysis will be on elucidating the links between cosmological parameters and observable features of the wmap and sdss power spectra , and on how these two data sets alone provide tight and robust constraints on many parameters that complement more aggressive but more systematics - prone analyses of multiple data sets .    in a parallel paper , percival @xcite present a power spectrum analysis of the main galaxy and lrg samples from the sdss dr5 data set @xcite , which is a superset of the data used here .",
    "there are a number of differences in the analysis methods .",
    "percival use an fft - based method to estimate the angle - averaged ( monopole ) redshift - space galaxy power spectrum .",
    "we use a pseudo - karhunen - love method @xcite ( see further discussion and references below ) to estimate the real space ( as opposed to redshift space ) galaxy power spectrum , using finger - of - god compression and linear theory to remove redshift - space distortion effects .",
    "in addition , the many technical decisions that go into these analyses , regarding completeness corrections , angular masks , k - corrections and so forth , were made independently for the two papers , and they present different tests for systematic uncertainties . despite these many differences of detail , our conclusions agree to the extent that they overlap ( as discussed in and appendix  [ methodcomparisonsec ] ) , a reassuring indication of the robustness of the results .",
    "the amount of information in a galaxy redshift survey about the galaxy power spectrum @xmath20 and cosmological parameters depends not on the number of galaxies _ per se _ , but on the _ effective volume _ of the survey , defined by @xcite as ( k)^2 d^3r , where @xmath21 is the expected number density of galaxies in the survey in the absence of clustering , and the fkp approximation of @xcite has been used .",
    "the power spectrum error bars scale approximately as @xmath22 , which for a fixed power @xmath23 is minimized if a fixed total number of galaxies are spaced with density @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the sdss luminous red galaxy ( lrg ) sample was designed @xcite to contain such `` goldilocks '' galaxies with a just - right number density for probing the power around the baryon wiggle scale @xmath25mpc .",
    "for comparison , the sdss main galaxy sample @xcite is much denser and is dominated by sample variance on these scales , whereas the sdss quasar sample @xcite is much sparser and is dominated by poisson shot noise . as shown in @xcite ,",
    "the effective volume of the lrg sample is about six times larger than that of the sdss main galaxies even though the number of lrgs is an order of magnitude lower , and the lrg volume is over ten times larger than that of the 2dfgrs .",
    "these scalings are confirmed by our results below , which show that @xmath26 on large scales is about six times smaller for the sdss lrgs than for the main sample galaxies .",
    "this gain results both from sampling a larger volume , and from the fact that the lrg are more strongly clustered ( biased ) than are ordinary galaxies ; @xmath23 for lrgs is about 3 times larger than for the main galaxy sample .",
    "we will therefore focus our analysis on the sdss lrg sample .",
    "although we also measure the sdss main sample power spectrum , it adds very little in terms of statistical constraining power ; increasing the effective volume by @xmath27 cuts the error bar @xmath28 by only about @xmath29 .",
    "this tiny improvement is easily outweighed by the gain in simplicity from analyzing lrgs alone , where ( as we will see ) complications such as redshift - dependence of clustering properties are substantially smaller .",
    "a complementary approach implemented by @xcite is to measure the angular clustering of sdss lrgs with photometric redshifts , compensating for the loss of radial information with an order of magnitude more galaxies extending out to higher redshift .",
    "we will see that this gives comparable or slightly smaller error bars on very large scales @xmath30 , but slightly larger error bars on the smaller scales that dominate our cosmological constraints ; this is because the number of modes down to a given scale @xmath1 grows as @xmath31 for our three - dimensional spectroscopic analysis , whereas they grow only as @xmath32 for a 2-dimensional angular analysis .",
    "in the recent literature , two - point galaxy clustering has been quantified using a variety of estimators of both power spectra and correlation functions .",
    "the most recent power spectrum measurements for both the 2dfgrs @xcite and the sdss @xcite have all interpolated the galaxy density field onto a cubic grid and measured @xmath0 using a fast fourier transform ( fft ) .",
    "appendix  [ methodcomparisonsec ] shows that as long as discretization errors from the fft gridding are negligible , this procedure is mathematically equivalent to measuring the correlation function with a weighted version of the standard `` dd-2dr+rr '' method @xcite , multiplying by `` rr '' and then fourier transforming",
    ". thus the only advantage of the fft approach is numerical speedup , and comparing the results with recent correlation function analyses such as @xcite will provide useful consistency checks .",
    "another approach , pioneered by @xcite , has been to construct `` lossless '' estimators of the power spectrum with the smallest error bars that are possible based on information theory @xcite .",
    "we will travel this complementary route in the present paper , following the matrix - based pseudo karhunen - love ( pkl ) eigenmode method described in @xcite , as it has the following advantages :    1 .",
    "it produces power spectrum measurements with uncorrelated error bars .",
    "it produces narrow and well - behaved window functions . 3 .",
    "it is lossless in the information theory sense .",
    "4 .   it treats redshift distortions without the small - angle approximation .",
    "it readily incorporates the so - called integral constraint @xcite , which can otherwise artificially suppress large - scale power .",
    "it allows testing for systematics that produce excess power in angular or radial modes .",
    "these properties make the results of the pkl - method very easy to interpret and use .",
    "the main disadvantage is that the pkl - method is numerically painful to implement and execute ; our pkl analysis described below required about a terabyte of disk space for matrix storage and about a year of cpu time , which contributed to the long gestation period of this paper .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe our galaxy samples and our modeling of them in and measure their power spectra in .",
    "we explore what this does and does not reveal about cosmological parameters in .",
    "we summarize our conclusions and place them in context in .",
    "further details about analysis techniques are given in appendix a.",
    "=    -4.7 cm    -6 cm    the sdss @xcite uses a mosaic ccd camera @xcite on a dedicated telescope @xcite to image the sky in five photometric bandpasses denoted @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "after astrometric calibration @xcite , photometric data reduction @xcite and photometric calibration @xcite , galaxies are selected for spectroscopic observations @xcite . to a good approximation , the main galaxy sample consists of all galaxies with @xmath35-band apparent petrosian magnitude @xmath38 after correction for reddening as per @xcite ; there are about 90 such galaxies per square degree , with a median redshift of 0.1 and a tail out to @xmath39 .",
    "galaxy spectra are also measured for the lrg sample @xcite , targeting an additional @xmath40 galaxies per square degree , enforcing @xmath41 and color - magnitude cuts described in @xcite that select mainly luminous elliptical / early type galaxies at redshifts up to @xmath42 .",
    "these targets are assigned to spectroscopic plates of diameter @xmath43 into which 640 optical fibers are plugged by an adaptive tiling algorithm @xcite , feeding a pair of ccd spectrographs @xcite , after which the spectroscopic data reduction and redshift determination are performed by automated pipelines .",
    "the rms galaxy redshift errors are of order 30 km / s for main galaxies and 50 km / s for lrgs @xcite , hence negligible for the purposes of the present paper .",
    "our analysis is based on @xmath44 lrgs and @xmath45 main galaxies ( the `` safe13 '' cut ) from the @xmath46 galaxies in the 4th sdss data release (  dr4 \" ) @xcite , processed via the sdss data repository at new york university @xcite .",
    "the details of how these samples were processed and modeled are given in appendix a of @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "the bottom line is that each sample is completely specified by three entities :    1 .",
    "the galaxy positions ( ra , dec and comoving redshift space distance @xmath35 for each galaxy ) , 2 .   the radial selection function @xmath47 , which gives the expected number density of galaxies as a function of distance , 3 .   the angular selection function @xmath48 , which gives the completeness as a function of direction in the sky , specified in a set of spherical polygons @xcite .",
    "our samples are constructed so that their three - dimensional selection function is separable , , simply the product @xmath49 of an angular and a radial part ; here @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the comoving radial distance and the unit vector corresponding to the position @xmath52 .",
    "the effective sky area covered is @xmath53 square degrees , and the typical completeness @xmath48 exceeds 90% .",
    "the radial selection function @xmath47 for the lrgs is the one constructed and described in detail in @xcite , based on integrating an empirical model of the luminosity function and color distribution of the lrgs against the luminosity - color selection boundaries of the sample .",
    "shows that it agrees well with the observed galaxy distribution . the conversion from redshift @xmath37 to comoving distance",
    "was made for a flat @xmath3cdm cosmological model with @xmath54 .",
    "if a different cosmological model is used for this conversion , then our measured dimensionless power spectrum @xmath55 is dilated very slightly ( by @xmath56 for models consistent with our measurements ) along the @xmath1-axis ; we include this dilation effect in our cosmological parameter analysis as described in appendix  [ likelihoodsec ] .    for systematics testing and numerical purposes",
    ", we also analyze a variety of sub - volumes in the lrg sample .",
    "we split the sample into three radial slices , labeled near ( @xmath57 ) , mid ( @xmath58 ) and far ( @xmath59 ) , containing roughly equal numbers of galaxies , as illustrated in .",
    "their galaxy - weighted mean redshifts are @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "we also split the sample into the seven angular regions illustrated in , each again containing roughly the same number of galaxies .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the lrgs constitute a remarkably clean and uniform galaxy sample , containing the same type of galaxy ( luminous early - types ) at all redshifts .",
    "not only is it nearly complete ( @xmath63 as mentioned above ) , but it is close to volume - limited for @xmath64 @xcite , , for our near and mid slices .",
    "we measure the power spectrum of our various samples using the pkl method described in @xcite .",
    "we follow the procedure of @xcite exactly , with some additional numerical improvements described in appendix a , so we merely summarize the process very briefly here .",
    "the first step is to adjust the galaxy redshifts slightly to compress so - called fingers - of - god ( fogs ) , virialized galaxy clusters that appear elongated along the line - of - sight in redshift space ; we do this with several different thresholds and return to how this affects the results in .",
    "the lrgs are not just brightest cluster galaxies ; about 20% of them appear to reside in a dark matter halo with one or more other lrg s .",
    "the second step is to expand the three - dimensional galaxy density field in @xmath65 three - dimensional functions termed pkl - eigenmodes , whose variance and covariance retain essentially all the information about the @xmath66mpc power spectrum from the galaxy catalog .",
    "we use @xmath67 modes for the lrg sample and @xmath68 modes for the main sample , reflecting their very different effective volumes .",
    "the third step is estimating the power spectrum from quadratic combinations of these pkl mode coefficients by a matrix - based process analogous to the standard procedure for measuring cmb power spectra from pixelized cmb maps .",
    "the second and third steps are mathematically straightforward but , as mentioned , numerically demanding for large @xmath65 .           the real - space galaxy power spectrum @xmath20 in units of @xmath69 measured from the lrg sample .",
    "the errors on @xmath23 are @xmath6 , uncorrelated between bands .",
    "the @xmath1-column gives the median of the window function and its @xmath70 and @xmath71 percentiles ; the exact window functions from http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/sdss.html ( see ) should be used for any quantitative analysis .",
    "nonlinear modeling is definitely required if the six measurements on the smallest scales ( below the line ) are used for model fitting .",
    "these error bars do not include an overall calibration uncertainty of @xmath72 ( @xmath6 ) related to redshift space distortions ( see appendix  [ betasec ] ) .       ) .",
    "tells us that , in the small angle approximation , the disentanglement method would correspond to measuring @xmath73 .",
    "the corresponding weights for the modeling method are found by minimizing the variance among the class of all unbiased estimators , and thus depend on the detailed survey geometry , the shot noise level , empirically , we find @xmath74 , with the weights roughly independent of @xmath1 .",
    "this can be intuitively understood from the fact that the estimators of @xmath75 and @xmath76 are much noisier than that for @xmath77 , and thus get assigned low statistical weight .",
    "if @xmath75 and @xmath76 were so noisy that they were discarded altogether , only the estimator of @xmath77 would be used .",
    "the relation @xmath78 following from would then give the simple estimator @xmath79 for @xmath80 , @xmath81 , , weights close to those we find empirically . our measured uncertainty in this normalization factor",
    "@xmath82 is about @xmath72 ( see ) , in good agreement with the exact numerical calculation described in @xcite , and this translates into an overall @xmath72 calibration uncertainty of our measured power spectrum which is perfectly correlated between all @xmath1-bands .",
    "the fact that the quantity measured by our power spectrum estimator @xmath83 is so similar to the rescaled redshift space monopole spectrum is convenient , since it implies that nonlinear simulations of the redshift space power spectrum ( as discussed in ) should apply rather well to our results .",
    "however , it is important to keep in mind that our measurement @xmath83 is a more accurate estimator of @xmath84 than the rescaled redshift space power spectrum would be , for several reasons .",
    "first , it never resorts to the small - angle approximation .",
    "second , full account is taken of the fact that anisotropic survey geometry can skew the relative abundance of galaxy pairs around a single point that are aligned along or perpendicularly to the line - of - sight .",
    "these two caveats matter because @xmath85 and @xmath86 are undefined except in the small angle limit , which could cause the correction factor @xmath82 to be inaccurate on large scales .",
    "finally , our estimator @xmath83 by construction has smaller error bars than a standard fkp estimator of the redshift space power spectrum , and one expects this advantage to be most important on the largest scales , comparable to and exceeding the thickness of the slices seen in .",
    "we performed our power spectrum analysis in comoving three - dimensional space , with the conversion of redshifts into comoving distances performed for a fiducial flat @xmath3cdm model with @xmath54 .",
    "as described in , the conversion between redshift and comoving distance ( measured in @xmath87 ) depends on the cosmological parameters @xmath88 , so if a different fiducial model had been used for the conversion , then the inferred three - dimensional galaxy distribution in comoving coordinates would be radially dilated . as discussed in @xcite and",
    ", this would approximately dilate the dimensionless power spectrum @xmath55 by scaling the @xmath1-axis by a factor a , where @xmath89 is given by and @xmath9 is the median survey redshift . for the parameter range allowed by wmap3 and our lrg data , a(0.25)^-0.087 ( -w ) ^0.19 .",
    "this means that the typical correction is very small : the rms scatter in the scaling factor @xmath90 is 0.7% for vanilla models , 1% for curved models and 3% for @xmath91-models .",
    "for example , increasing the fiducial @xmath4-value by 25% , from 0.24 to 0.30 , alters the scaling factor by 2% and , since the power spectrum turnover scale @xmath92 , ignoring this correction could potentially bias the measured @xmath4-value from @xmath93 to @xmath94 .    to be conservative ,",
    "we nonetheless correct for this scaling effect in our likelihood software . reanalyzing the galaxy data with the fiducial model replaced by",
    "the one to be tested would shift the measured @xmath0 curve up to the left on a log - log plot if @xmath95 , with @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "we therefore apply the opposite scaling ( @xmath98 and @xmath99 ) to the theoretically predicted power spectrum @xmath0 before computing its @xmath100 against our measurement power spectrum from table  .",
    "we repeated our entire power spectrum analysis for @xmath101 and confirmed that this scaling is accurate .",
    "our likelihood software , which is available at http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/sdss/ , evaluates @xmath90 exactly instead of using .    in summary ,",
    "the correction discussed in this section is quite small , especially since marginalizing over bias erases the effect of the @xmath102 amplitude shift , but we include it anyway to ensure that there is no bias on cosmological parameter estimates ."
