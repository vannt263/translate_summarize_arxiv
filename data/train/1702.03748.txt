    "the optical waveguide coupler is one of the key elements in integrated optical devices @xcite and quantum circuits @xcite .",
    "however it is difficult to have compact optical devices due to the requirement of longer wavelength of the light in various applications . to overcome this challenge ,",
    "an electron waveguide was first proposed in analogy to the optical waveguide @xcite , where the electrons are trapped in a quantum well structure composed of algaas / gaas material and ballistic electron transport is assumed .",
    "subsequently , exploiting the coupling of two parallel electron waveguides , another type of electron switching device was proposed .",
    "these types of electron waveguide switches are expected to have ultrafast operating speed .",
    "recent calculations show that the operating frequency of an electron switch device can be up to @xmath0 s@xmath1 and the maximum coupling energy between the waveguides can be 10 mev @xcite , which corresponds to a very short coupling length of about 280 nm . despite these encouraging predictions ,",
    "it has never been realized experimentally at room temperature probably due to the unjustified assumption of long electron mean free path at the interface of algaas / gaas material at room temperature . at room temperature",
    ", the electrons will suffer inelastic scattering and the coherent phase of the wave packet can not be maintained .",
    "thus , an electron switching waveguide based on algaas / gaas materials at room temperature may not be practical for which ultra - low temperature ( typically below 4k ) is required @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose to use graphene as the material due to its long electron mean free path , about 4 to 10 @xmath2 m @xcite at room temperature , which may be larger than the characteristic length of the device .",
    "thus ballistic electron transport can be maintained at room temperature .",
    "recent experiments @xcite have successfully demonstrated ballistic electron transport in a quantum well created on graphene on the length scale of a few @xmath2 m .",
    "another advantage in using graphene is its ability of tuning fermi energy level via gating voltage , which offers additional control over the device performance .",
    "the tunable schottky barrier height formed at the interface of graphene and different semiconductors ( e.g. si and gaas ) has been confirmed both experimentally and theoretically @xcite .",
    "all these technological advancements allow for the development of ultrafast electron waveguide switching devices by using graphene materials , which can be lightweight , easily - architectured , compact and cost - effective , as proposed in this paper .    in our two - dimensional ( 2d ) model ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 geometry ) , we propose an ultrafast quantum field - effect transistor ( fet ) like electron switching device consisting of two parallel graphene electron waveguides as shown in fig .",
    "the width of the waveguide is @xmath5 and the separation of the two waveguides is @xmath6 .",
    "aligned with the standard complementary metal - oxide - semiconductor ( cmos ) fet terminology , the two parallel graphene waveguides can be regarded as a source waveguide and a drain waveguide . for each graphene",
    "waveguide , the two ends are referred as its input and output for the electrical signal . the ohmic contact between the metal electrodes and the graphene",
    "is assumed to enable sufficient electron injection into the waveguides .",
    "when a small voltage is applied at the left graphene waveguide , an electrical current can be measured at the outputs of both graphene waveguides .",
    "the gate voltages ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) on each graphene waveguide are used to tune the fermi level of each channel independently .",
    "consequently , we are able to modulate the schottky barrier height ( @xmath9 ) and thickness layer ( @xmath6 ) between the graphenes .",
    "if the schottky barrier height and the effective gap spacing between the two graphene waveguides are sufficiently small , the evanescent wave of the injected electrons in the source waveguide can tunnel into the drain waveguide with some probability as represented by the red curve in fig .",
    "the phase of the electrons is maintained during the tunneling process .",
    "quantum mechanically , the injected electrons in the source waveguide can be detected at the drain waveguide with a probability equal to 1 [ see black curved arrow in fig . 1 ( b ) ] at a certain transfer length @xmath10 , which will be calculated in this paper .",
    "is the schottky barrier height between graphene and gaas or silicon material and @xmath7 , @xmath8 are the bias voltages applied to modulate the coupling length between the two graphene waveguides .",
    "@xmath5 is the width of the graphene quantum wells and @xmath6 is the distance between the two graphene electron waveguides . ]     of quantum well and distance @xmath6 between two graphene electron waveguides .",
    "we set @xmath11 and schottky barrier height between graphene and gaas is 500 mev .",
    "@xmath12 mev . ]",
    "coupled - mode theory ( cmt ) was initially developed for guided - wave optics to describe the coupling between adjacent optical waveguides , due to the overlap of their evanescent electromagnetic fields .",
    "this allows light to be transferred robustly from one optical waveguide to the other @xcite .    by drawing the analogy between the wave nature of electrons ( as massless particles ) in graphene to electromagnetic waves in optical waveguides",
    ", cmt is revised to describe the coupling between two parallel graphene electron waveguides as shown in fig .",
    "1 . when the graphene electron waveguides are closely positioned , electrons can be efficiently coupled . for",
    "the proposed electron switching device , we assume that the two bias gate voltages @xmath7 and @xmath8 are equal , thus realizing an electron tunneling version of the rabi oscillations . based on cmt , the coupling length @xmath10 will depend on a coupling parameter defined as @xmath13 ( see definition below ) between the two graphene waveguides , namely @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is integer , @xmath16 is the transition frequency , and @xmath17 m / s is the fermi velocity of electrons in graphene . in fig .",
    "2 , we show a contour plot of the transition frequency @xmath18 as a function of the spacing @xmath6 between the two graphene waveguides and the width of the quantum wells @xmath5 .",
    "the scaling of transition frequency in terms of gap spacing ( @xmath6 ) is @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the theoretical maximum coupling strength and @xmath21 is a fitting number , determining by @xmath22 , @xmath9 and @xmath23 .",
    "compared with prior electron switching devices based on algaas / gaas materials , our proposed design based on graphene waveguides will have larger coupling energy ( around 15 mev ) and faster operating frequency ( @xmath24 1 ps in terms of time scale ) as shown in fig .",
    "2 . most importantly , our proposed device is able to operate at room temperature due to the long mean free path of electrons in the graphene as compared to algaas / gaas materials .    in our model",
    ", graphene is used as the electron waveguide channel and gaas is the material for the potential barrier .",
    "the electrons inside the graphene waveguide channels are described by dirac equation and schrdinger equation is used to describe electrons dynamics in the potential barrier ( gaas ) .",
    "previous work on single graphene electron waveguide channel @xcite has shown that the evanescent electron wave will exponentially decay outside of graphene electron waveguide . according to hartmann s @xcite and xu s @xcite papers ,",
    "there are two kinds of stable modes in graphene electron waveguide dependent on two sub - lattice modes : @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is anti - symmetric and @xmath28 is symmetric .",
    "the coupling between the same anti - symmetric functions , and the coupling between the antisymmetric - symmetric functions is , respectively , 0.24 mev and 0.14 mev , which is much smaller than the coupling between the two symmetric fucntions ( 1.58 mev ) .",
    "thus , we only consider the later coupling in this paper .    in fig .",
    "3 , we show the symmetrical wave function in a symmetrical potential well for different width of graphene electron waveguide @xmath5 = 200 , 300 , 400 , and 500 nm . the probability current density through the interface of graphene and gaas is conserved @xcite . unless specified , the default parameters are @xmath9=500 mev , @xmath29=450 mev , and @xmath30= 4.96 @xmath31 where @xmath32 is defined as the wave vector in the @xmath3 direction .     in the graphene electron waveguide for different widths @xmath5 of the quantum well .",
    "schottky barrier height between graphene and algaas / gaas is 500 mev and @xmath29=450 mev , so that the effective barrier height between the two graphene waveguides is 50 mev and @xmath33 .",

    "the motion of the electrons in the graphene electron waveguides is described by the 1d free electron dirac equation , which allows us to decouple the wavefunctions into two sublattices a and b wave functions ( see the appendix for details ) .",
