    "in the past years , considerable efforts have been devoted to discrete flavor symmetry and many discrete groups have been considered as family symmetry groups to derive some mass independent textures , see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews .",
    "in particular , it has been realized that tri - bimaximal ( tb ) mixing matrix @xcite , which is at least a good zeroth order approximation to the current neutrino oscillation data @xcite , can naturally arise as the result of a particular vacuum alignment of scalars that spontaneously break certain discrete flavor symmetries .",
    "many discrete groups have been exploited to reproduce tb mixing so far and the @xmath0 group seems to be especially suitable to perform this task .",
    "it has been demonstrated , through group theoretical analysis , that the minimal flavor symmetry capable of yielding the tb mixing without fine tuning is @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "however , from the model building point of view , @xmath0 appears to be the most economical and simplest realization which naturally produces the tb mixing pattern .",
    "there was great interest in @xmath0 as a family symmetry in the recent past and various @xmath0 models have been constructed .",
    "we can approximately categorize the @xmath0 models into three classes based on the neutrino mass generation mechanisms ; there exist models in which neutrino masses arise from higher dimensional effective operators and models in which neutrino masses are generated via the see - saw mechanisms ( being the canonical type i , type ii , type iii see - saw mechanisms or the combination of them or the inverse and linear see - saw mechanisms ) .",
    "the third class of @xmath0 models generates neutrino masses via one - loop or two - loop radiative corrections but they are rare .",
    "some of the models also try to extend the @xmath0 flavor symmetry to the quark sector in the framework of the standard model ( sm ) and in grand unified theories ( gut ) .",
    "table [ tab : classfication ] is an attempt to classify the large number of @xmath0 models on the market , based on an earlier classification done in ref.@xcite .",
    "we only list models where the focus was the study of flavor mixings ; however , there are also papers based on @xmath0 discussing the dark matter @xcite and the electroweak constraints / phenomenology @xcite . from table [",
    "tab : classfication ] , we can clearly see that the three lepton doublet fields are assigned as @xmath0 triplet in almost all the models and much the same happens for the right - handed neutrino @xmath9 in type i see - saw , for the field @xmath10 in type ii see - saw and for the @xmath11 s in type iii ( we will call these fields see - saw fields in the following ) . in this paper , we present an @xmath0 model for tb mixing where the right - handed neutrinos @xmath9 transform as @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 under @xmath0 , all the right - handed charged leptons @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are @xmath0 singlet @xmath12 and the three generations of left - handed lepton doublets @xmath18 are assigned to a triplet @xmath19 .",
    "this assignment has not been considered so far , as it can be seen from table [ tab : classfication ] .",
    "this model is as simple as previous @xmath0 models but the phenomenological predictions are drastically different : the light neutrino mass spectrum is of normal hierarchy type and the lightest neutrino mass is exactly zero at lo , although three right - handed neutrinos are introduced .",
    "the first one does not contribute to the leptonic cp asymmetry even if nlo contributions are included and leptogenesis is realized via the resonant leptogenesis mechanism of the second and third right - handed heavy neutrinos , which are degenerate at lo .",
    "the resulting predictions for lepton flavor violation are distinct from existing @xmath0 models as well .",
    "the present model is a complete new variant of @xmath0 flavor models presented in the literature .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the structure of the model at leading order ( lo ) and show that the neutrino mass matrix is exactly diagonalized by tb matrix . in section 3 we justify the vacuum alignment assumed in the previous section by minimizing the scalar potential of the model in the supersymmetric limit .",
    "the next to leading order ( nlo ) corrections induced by higher dimensional operators are analyzed in section 4 .",
    "we discuss the phenomenological predictions of the model for leptogenesis and lepton flavor violation in section 5 . finally section 6 is devoted to our discussions and conclusions . in order to make",
    "the paper self - contained we include appendix a on the @xmath0 group and its representations .",

    "`` effective '' means that the neutrino masses are generated via effective operators , the abbreviation `` ss '' denotes see - saw mechanisms and `` radiative '' indicates that neutrino masses are induced as one - loop or two - loop radiative corrections . the symbol and in the quark and gut columns refers to whether @xmath0 has been extended to the quark sector and embedded into gut theories , respectively . for the linear and inverse see - saw neutrino mass generation @xcite",

    "in this work we have constructed a new model for tb mixing with a global flavor symmetry @xmath21 .",
    "all the right - handed matter fields are assigned to @xmath0 singlets : the three right - handed neutrinos @xmath9 transform as @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 and the right - handed charged leptons @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are all invariant under @xmath0 .",
    "the three generations of leptons form an @xmath0 triplet @xmath19 as usual .",
    "the easiest way to break the flavor symmetry is to introduce only one flavon in the neutrino sector but the resulting neutrino mass spectrum gives @xmath22=0 or @xmath23 and then incompatible with the data . as a consequence , we should introduce at least two flavon fields in the neutrino sector to obtain a phenomenologically viable model .",
    "this statement generally holds if the right - handed neutrinos are assumed to be @xmath0 singlets .",
    "the model would appear more symmetric if we let the charged lepton fields @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 to transform as @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 as well .",
    "but in this case we would need to introduce a froggatt - nielsen @xmath24 symmetry to generate the charged lepton mass hierarchies .",
    "it is remarkable that we can still produce tb mixing although the @xmath0 symmetry is broken completely at lo in both the neutrino and charged lepton sectors ; the reason being an accidental @xmath25 symmetry preserved in the mass matrices .",
    "this is a special feature of present model .",
    "the light neutrino mass spectrum is predicted to be normal hierarchy and the lightest neutrino mass is zero at lo although three right - handed neutrinos are introduced ( generally massless neutrino are realized via the minimal see - saw mechansim ) .",
    "the effective mass of neutrinoless double-@xmath26 decay is predicted to be about 2.9 mev , which is much below the prospective sensitivities of future experiments .",
    "all three lepton mixing angles receive corrections of order @xmath2 from the nlo corrections since no special dynamics is introduced to separate the corrections to @xmath1 from the other angles .",
    "although the reactor angle @xmath1 is expected to be of order @xmath2 , we have shown that our model can accommodate values of @xmath1 consistent with the recent experimental results .",
    "consequently the model can not be ruled out by present data , although there is hint of relatively larger @xmath1 from the t2k collaboration .",
    "precise measurement of @xmath1 is the most direct test of the model : if it is found to be near the present upper bound , a large class of discrete flavor symmetry models ( including the present one ) would be ruled out and the tb mixing may not be a good starting point for model building .",
    "the predictions for leptogenesis and lfv branching ratios are analyzed in detail .",
    "we find that the first heavy right - handed neutrino does not contribute to the leptonic cp asymmetry even if nlo corrections are taken into account .",
    "the leptogenesis is realized via the so - called resonant leptogenesis of the second and third heavy neutrinos which are degenerate at lo . in order to account for the observed baryon asymmetry ,",
    "moderate fine tuning among the neutrino yukawa couplings is required .",
    "the lfv branching ratios are predicted to be rather small because they are proportional to the fourth power of the neutrino yukawa couplings , of order @xmath2 at lo .",
    "we find that the lfv processes @xmath27 and @xmath28 conversion in @xmath29ti and @xmath30al are within the reach of next generation of experiments ; in particular , @xmath28 conversion in @xmath29ti could impose extremely strong constraints on the model due to the considerable improvement of its sensitivity in near future , whereas the branching fractions of @xmath31 , @xmath32 and trilepton decay @xmath33 are far below the present and future sensitivities .",
    "the above theoretical predictions for neutrinoless double-@xmath26 decay and lfv processes are other important tests of the model .",

    "in this appendix , we briefly review some basic properties of the @xmath0 group . @xmath0",
    "is the even permutation group of four objects , it has 12 elements .",
    "geometrically , it is the symmetry group of a regular tetrahedron .",
    "the elements of @xmath0 can be generated by two generators @xmath34 and @xmath35 obeying the relation : @xmath36 the 12 elements of @xmath0 are obtained as @xmath37 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 . without loss of generality , we can choose @xmath47 where the cycle @xmath48 represents the permutation @xmath49 and @xmath50 means @xmath51 .",
    "the @xmath0 elements belong to 4 conjugate classes : @xmath52 there are 4 inequivalent irreducible representations of @xmath0 : three singlet representation @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and one triplet representation @xmath19 . for the one - dimensional representations , from the generator relation in eq.([eq : relation ] ) , we can easily obtain that the representations are given by : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the cube root of unit .",
    "for the three - dimensional representation , in the basis where @xmath35 is diagonal , it is given by @xmath55 the multiplication rules between various irreducible representations are as follows : @xmath56 where @xmath57 denotes any @xmath0 representation . from eq.([eq : rep1 ] ) and eq.([eq : rep2 ] ) , we can straightforwardly obtain the decomposition of the product representations . for two @xmath0 triplets @xmath58 and @xmath59 , we have : @xmath60 furthermore , if @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are @xmath0 singlets transforming as @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , then the products @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are triplets explicitly given by @xmath67 and @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "it is interesting to note that if the @xmath0 flavor symmetry is broken down to the @xmath70 subgroup generated by @xmath34 in the neutrino sector , then the neutrino mass matrix @xmath71 is invariant under the action of @xmath34 , i.e. , @xmath72 ; consequently @xmath71 has the general form : @xmath73 it admits the eigenvector ( 1,1,1 ) so that the trimaximal mixing can be reproduced naturally . with proper choice of flavon fields in the neutrino sector , e.g. , in the absence of flavon transforming as @xmath13 or @xmath14 , the @xmath74 symmetry arises accidentally . as a consequence , we have @xmath75 and the resulting neutrino mass matrix is exactly diagonalized by the tb mixing matrix .",
