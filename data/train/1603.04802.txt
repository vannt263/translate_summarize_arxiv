    "<S> we employed an effective substitutional two - site cluster equivalent to the real non - substitutional @xmath0-sn defect , which was determined by a green s functions calculation . </S>",
    "<S> we then calculated the electronic structure of the effective alloy purely in terms of substitutional defects , embedding the effective substitutional clusters in the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> our results describe the two transitions of the fundamental gap of ge@xmath1sn@xmath2 as a function of the total sn - concentration : namely from an indirect to a direct gap , first , and the metallization transition at higher @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> they also highlight the role of @xmath0-sn in the reduction of the concentration range which corresponds to the direct - gap phase of this alloy , of interest for optoelectronics applications . </S>"
