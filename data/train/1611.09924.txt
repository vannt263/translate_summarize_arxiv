    "we explain how existing tools can be used to extend this construction to links coloured by arbitrary partitions which categorifies the coloured homfly polynomial .",
    "the idea is as follows .",
    "first one defines a 2-category @xmath1 out of soergel bimodules and constructs a categorical @xmath2 action on it ( sections [ sec : gactions ] and [ sec : kn ] ) . combining this action with a trace 2-functor ( hochschild homology )",
    "one obtains a triply graded invariant for links coloured by partitions @xmath3 with only one part .    finally , to deal with an arbitrary partition @xmath4 one cables together @xmath5 strands labeled @xmath6 and composes with a certain projector @xmath7 .",
    "these projectors , which makes sense in the context of any @xmath2 action , were constructed in @xcite where they were used to categorify generalized jones - wenzl projectors ( a.k.a .",
    "clasps in the language of @xcite ) .",
    "apart from some general results on @xmath2 actions and associated braid group actions and projectors ( see for instance @xcite ) i have tried to keep this paper self - contained .",
    "there are many papers in the literature on coloured homfly homology and it is difficult to list them all without forgetting some .",
    "we try to recall some of the ones which are more closely related to this paper .",
    "there are several papers defining various generalities of triply graded homologies . in @xcite mackaay ,",
    "stosic and vaz work out the case of links labeled by the one part partition @xmath8 . in @xcite webster and williamson",
    "define a triply graded homology of links coloured by partitions with one part .",
    "their construction , which is geometric , is related to ours via the equivalence between perverse sheaves on finite flag varieties and ( singular ) soergel bimodules .",
    "this same relationship appears ( and is briefly discussed ) in @xcite .",
    "more recently , wedrich @xcite examines these constructions in the `` reduced '' case as well as some associated spectral sequences .    for partitions with more than one part",
    "the papers @xcite discuss the categorified homfly projectors for partitions with parts of size at most one . as with our projectors , these are build as infinite twists .",
    "as far as i understand , elias and hogancamp @xcite aim to develop a more systematic , more general construction of such projectors .",
    "this will hopefully shed some light on @xmath7 and the various properties they ( are expected to ) satisfy .    in @xcite it was conjectured ( and partially proved ) that there exist certain differentials on triply graded link homology which recovers @xmath9 link homology . in section [ sec : differentials ] we discuss a differential @xmath10 for @xmath11 which gives rise to an @xmath9-type link invariant .",
    "somewhat surprising , the resulting homology seems to be finite dimensional while categorifying @xmath9-representations of the form @xmath12 .",
