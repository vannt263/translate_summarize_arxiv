    "in contrast to the longitudinal case , where the spin polarization is measured in a region with a local current flow , the rsa holds over a large voltage range with a @xmath116 enhancement of the spin coherence reaching 5.27 ns at 3 v. @xmath123 decreases for higher voltages but still remains in the nanoseconds range up to 5 v. complementary , the current - controlled spin - orbit field attains more than 5 mt at 3 v. this field agrees with the theoretical value @xmath98 calculated for @xmath143 0.5 nm / ps in fig .

    "magnetotransport measurements in triple quantum wells are well described in the recent literature .",

    "figure 7 shows the longitudinal ( @xmath172 ) and transverse ( @xmath173 - hall ) magnetoresistance in a perpendicular field .",
    "the observed oscillations in @xmath172 consist of the interplay between two types of oscillating phenomena . in 2degs",
    ", shubnikov - de hass ( sdh ) oscillations occur due to a periodic modulation of electron scattering as the landau levels consecutively pass through the fermi level .",
    "additionally , in quantum wells with two or more occupied subbands , the magnetoresistance exhibits another type of oscillations , the so - called magnetointersubband ( mis ) oscillations .",
    "mis oscillations occur because of a modulation of the probability of transitions between the landau levels belonging to different subbands which is periodic in field .",
    "the mis oscillation peaks correspond to the maximal scattering of electrons between the landau levels when the subband separation equals a multiple of the cyclotron energy . for our high density 2deg",
    ", we can measure only high landau levels for moderate fields .",

    ", one can obtain the subbands density @xmath174 according to @xmath175 where @xmath176 is the frequency of the oscillation in the 1/b plot . in figure 8(b ) , the fourier transform results in 3 large peaks arising from the 3 subbands .",
    "the peak with lower frequency corresponds to the lower density in the third subband and the other two correspond to similar densities in the first and second subband .",
    "the first two - subbands are almost degenerate ( @xmath177 0 ) as confirmed by our calculation in the main text .",
    "we found that @xmath178 is very sensitive to the width of the lateral wells ( increasing rapidly for smaller widths ) .",
    "time - resolved kerr rotation ( trkr ) was used to study the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) spin dynamics .",
    "measurements were performed with and without external magnetic fields in order to characterize the ensemble coherence time ( @xmath123 ) and land @xmath71-factor ( @xmath71 ) dependence on excitation wavelength ( @xmath179 ) .",
    "figure 9(a ) shows trkr scans for different wavelength at b=0 .",
    "we found a change from an initial positive spin polarization to negative followed by an exponential decay .",
    "the trkr amplitude at zero time delay ( @xmath122 ) is plotted in figure 9(b ) .",

    ", the evolution of the kerr rotation angle can be described by an exponentially damped harmonic : @xmath184 where @xmath185 is the initial spin polarization build - up by the pump , @xmath186 is the oscillation phase , and @xmath187b/@xmath127 is the larmor frequency with magnetic field b , electron @xmath71-factor ( absolute value ) @xmath71 , bohr magneton @xmath126 , and reduced planck s constant @xmath127 .    the extracted magnetic field dependence of @xmath183 and t@xmath182 is shown in fig .",
    "9(c ) and ( d ) .",
    "we found @xmath123 in the 0.5 ns range decreasing for fields larger than 1 t. also , the electron g - factor presents a variation with the wavelength ( from 811 to 819 nm ) of 0.006 having a maximum at 817 nm .",
    "in the same wavelength range of section a , we investigated the amplitude dependence for the rsa pattern formation at a fixed voltage .",
    "the data is shown in figure 10 .",
    "w. @xmath116 = 3 v and t = 1.2 k ]    we found a strong dependence on @xmath179 with maximum signal at 817 nm .",
    "for the spin transport studies , we chose this wavelength as it strongly shows the current effect on the spin coherence added to the results in section a. we fixed @xmath188 817 nm for the following discussions .        next , we explore the temperature influence on the formation of the rsa pattern as function of the applied voltage .",
    "we compared the data at 1.2 and 10 k in figure 11 .",
    "clearly , the application of high voltages induces heating which in turn results in strong spin decoherence .",
    "this unwanted effect can be delayed by lowering the sample temperature . for t",
    "= 1.2 k , the spin polarization amplitude increases with the applied voltage reaching a maximum at 3.5 v followed by a decrease .",
    "furthermore , the resonances have a larger amplitude for larger fields , for example at 2.5 v. this is a known indication of long coherence time for the hole spins involved in the generation of the electron spin coherence.@xcite for t = 10 k , we can not observe any current - induced spin coherence beyond 2.0 v. also note the drastic change of the resonances width related to loss of spin coherence when increasing the temperature .",
    "in the main article text , we showed the spin transport length @xmath159 extracted from the decay of a single resonance peak at a given magnetic field . this is a condition of approximately constant field since the peak shifts due to the period modification with the @xmath71-factor variation in space .",
    "figures 12 and 13 show fittings , similar to the figure 5 in the main text , for different conditions of high and low magnetic field as well as different field polarity .",
    "all the results are consistent within the experimental error .",
    "we conclude that the obtained @xmath159 is robust and the long spin coherence is maintained for mt fields ( in agreement with figure 9(c ) ) .",
