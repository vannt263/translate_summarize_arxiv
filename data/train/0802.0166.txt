    "we will have a closer look at the structure of the fundamental intervals and we will introduce some more notation .",
    ".3 cm    for a fundamental interval , @xmath160 , the block of digits @xmath161 consists of several subblocks , each of which forms a full fundamental interval itself , except for possibly the last subblock .",
    "this last subblock will form a full fundamental interval if @xmath160 is full and it will form a non - full fundamental interval otherwise .",
    "we take these subblocks a small a possible , i.e. a new subblock starts , as soon as the previous subblock forms a full fundamental interval .",

    "for example , the block of digits from the fundamental interval @xmath163 can be divided into the three subblocks , @xmath164 , @xmath162 and @xmath165 . to make this subdivision more precise ,",
    "we need the notion of return time . for points",

    "@xmath119 by @xmath167 and for @xmath94 , let the @xmath168_-th return time to _ @xmath119 be given recursively by @xmath169 notice that this notion depends only on @xmath17 , i.e. for all @xmath170 and all @xmath94 , @xmath171 .",
    "so we can write @xmath172 instead of @xmath173 . in this sense , for each @xmath174 we can talk about the @xmath168-th return time of this element .",
    "if @xmath175 , then for all @xmath176 , @xmath177 maps the whole set @xmath178 to the same rectangle in @xmath122 .",
