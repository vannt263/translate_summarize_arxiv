    "heusler alloys ( ha ) attract significant attention due to their interesting physical properties promising various practical applications in the fields of smart materials and magneto - electronics.@xcite indeed , certain co@xmath0fe - based full - heusler alloys ( fha ) are predicted to be ferromagnetic and half - metallic , _",
    "i.e. _ , exhibiting near 100% spin polarization of the charge carriers at the fermi level .",
    "this property makes co@xmath0fe - based fha s ( and co@xmath0fege among them ) promising candidates to be used as spin - injectors in spintronic devices .",
    "furthermore , co@xmath0fe - based fha s have the highest curie temperatures among the known half - metallic ferromagnets . therefore , fabrication and investigation of the electronic structure and physical properties of co@xmath0fe - based fha films are of fundamental and technological interest .    the co@xmath0fege system and , in particular , films are rather unexplored .",
    "only a few publications discuss the physical properties of non - stoichiometric co - fe - ge alloy films [ ( cofe)@xmath4ge@xmath5 , ( cofe)@xmath6ge@xmath7 and spin - valves based on them . @xcite",
    "full - heusler @xmath82@xmath9-type ordered co@xmath10fe@xmath11ge@xmath12 thin films were successfully fabricated by takamura,_et al . _ using a thermally activated germanidation reaction between ultra - thin germanium - on - insulator and co - fe layers deposited on it.@xcite however , such films showed magnetic moments of @xmath13=4.8@xmath3 , which was notably smaller than the bulk value of @xmath13=5.54@xmath3@xcite , probably due to their off - stoichiometry .",
    "the important aspect of the half - metallic heusler alloys is their unique magneto - optical ( mo ) properties : a discovery of giant kerr rotation in half - heusler ptmnsb alloy opens the way for applications in mo reading - recording.@xcite optical and mo properties of a number of half - metallic fha s have been investigated theoretically and experimentally.@xcite it has been shown that the predictions significantly depend on the calculation methods employed.@xcite at the same time , the experimental optical and mo properties of the ha s are often quite difficult to explain without first - principle calculations .",
    "it is preferred , therefore , to combine the two approaches for a comprehensive analysis of a specific material , explaining the measured data at the same time as verifying experimentally the theoretical model used .",
    "optical and magneto - optical properties of co@xmath0fege compound were have been simulated by kim _",
    "_ using the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) and gga+u approaches.@xcite it was shown that the predicted properties significantly depend on calculation approach used , so a comparison with the experiment was necessary to validate and , if necessary , refine the alternatives .",
    "therefore , one of the article s purpose is checking the correctness of various calculation tools by the comparison of calculated and experimental physical ( optical and magnetic ) properties of alloy .    in this work",
    "we fabricate the largely unexplored co@xmath0fege alloy in the film form using sputtering , measure their optical and magnetic properties , and develop and refine first - principles models for explaining the data observed .",
    "our results indicate half - metallicity , which should be interesting for a number of applications .",
    "co@xmath0fege heusler alloy films of 50 nm in thickness were deposited at 500 @xmath14c on thermally oxidized si substrates using dc magnetron co - sputtering from co@xmath0fe and ge targets .",
    "the base pressure in the deposition chamber was 5@xmath1510@xmath16 torr and the ar pressure used during deposition was 5 mtorr .",
    "the deposition rates for co@xmath0fe and ge components were 0.0781 and 0.0174 nm / sec , respectively .",
    "the film composition was determined using x - ray dispersion spectroscopy analysis .",
    "the crystalline structure was analyzed using x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) in the @xmath172@xmath18 geometry with cu - k@xmath19 radiation of 1.5406   wavelength .",
    "magnetic measurements were performed using a squid mpms-5 magnetometer in the temperature range of 5 - 300 k. magnetic field was applied in the film plane .",
    "the substrate contribution was subtracted using the methods described by garcia _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite    the electronic structure , optical properties such as the dielectric function ( df ) , and and magnetic properties of the co@xmath0fege alloy with @xmath20 type sructure ( space group @xmath21 ) were calculated using the wien2k code@xcite , utilizing a full - potential linearized - augmented - plane - wave method with gga and gga+u methods.@xcite for the exchange - correlation functional , the generalized - gradient - approximation version of perdew _ et al_.@xcite was used . in the @xmath20-type structure",
    "co atoms are located at ( 1/4 , 1/4 , 1/4 ) , fe atoms at ( 0.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 ) and ge atoms at ( 1/2 , 1/2 , 1/2 ) in the unit cell of a 225 space group .",
    "the cell size was determined in the calculations from minimizing the full electron energy versus the lattice parameter .",
    "self - consistency was obtained using 816 k - points in the irreducible brillouin zone ( ibz ) . to calculate the df of co@xmath0fege we used 4285 k - points in the ibz .",
    "the calculated optical properties of the co@xmath0fege ha were compared with the experimental ones .",
    "optical properties , such as [ @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the optical conductivity ( oc ) , @xmath23 and @xmath25 the real and imaginary parts of the diagonal components of the df @xmath26 of the samples were measured using a spectroscopic rotating analyzer - ellipsometer , at 293 k , in the spectral range of 310 - 2500 nm ( 4.0 - 0.5 ev ) at a fixed incidence angle of 73@xmath14 .",
    "the calculated density of the electronic states ( dos ) for co@xmath0fege alloy with the @xmath20-type crystal structure and the lattice parameter of @xmath27=5.75  , obtained using the gga and gga + u approaches , are shown in fig .",
    "it is seen that the main contributions to the resulting dos of co@xmath0fege alloy obtained by either gga or gga+u methods are due to the co and fe atoms .",
    "the co and fe states are hybridized - the most intense peaks of the dos are formed by the coincident in energy co and fe states .",
    "a detailed analysis shows that the contribution to the hybridized states is due mainly to the co and fe 3@xmath28 states , which indicates a covalent character of their interaction .",
    "the contribution to the total dos from the ge states is small .",

    "thus , gga+u predicts co@xmath0fege ha to be a half - metal with the spin polarization of @xmath29=1.000 , while gga predicts still a rather high @xmath29=0.504 .    the dos shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] agree well with the results in the literature obtained for @xmath20-type ordered co@xmath0mnge using lda , lda+u , gga , and gga+u.@xcite    the gga and gga+u methods reveal somewhat different values of the magnetic moment of the alloy .",
    "according to the slater - pauling rule,@xcite l2@xmath9-type co@xmath0fege ha should have a magnetic moment of @xmath30 = @xmath31 - 24 = 6@xmath3 , where @xmath31= 2co ( 3@xmath32)+fe(3@xmath33)+ge(4@xmath34)= 30 .",
    "the gga+u result for the magnetic moment is almost exactly that expected from slater - pauling , @xmath35 , co=1.509@xmath3 , fe=3.146@xmath3 , ge=-0.011@xmath3 , while gga yields @xmath36 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] b ) .",
    "approximately the same difference between the magnetic moments of co@xmath0fege calculated using lda ( gga ) and lda+u ( gga+u ) can be found in the literature .",

    "because of rather small co@xmath0fege alloy films thickness ( 50 nm ) their composition was examined by employing both energy - dispersive x - ray spectrometer of jeol jsm-6490lv and wavelength dispersive x - ray spectrometer of jeol jxa-8200 .",
    "aforementioned tools revealed a composition ( in atomic percent ) of co@xmath39fe@xmath40ge@xmath41 and co@xmath42fe@xmath43ge@xmath44 ( hereafter co@xmath0fege ) , respectively .    the x - ray diffraction pattern for a co@xmath0fege film deposited on a thermally oxidized si substrate is shown in fig . [ fig2 ] .",
    "additional to the reflection peaks of the si substrate , only one diffraction peak of co@xmath0fege is present .",
    "it corresponds to a ( 220 ) diffraction peak of a cubic structure and connected with a non - epitaxial growth of the co@xmath0fege film.@xcite the deposited film grows on the amorphous sio@xmath0 surface that does not provide favourable conditions for epitaxy .",
    "the lattice parameter derived using bragg s law is @xmath27=5.702  .",
    "this value is slightly lower than those determined experimentally for bulk stoichiometric co@xmath0fege alloy ( @xmath27=5.738 or @xmath27=5.743 ).@xcite applying the volume correction to our data yields @xmath27=5.75  .",
    "magnetic hysteresis loops for a co@xmath0fege film measured at different temperatures are shown in fig .",
    "the film demonstrates ferromagnetic properties in the whole investigated temperature range .",
    "the saturation magnetization practically does not change with temperature from 10 to 300 k , decreasing only by @xmath453% ( from 1120 emu / cc to 1090 emu / cc ) .",
    "such behavior of magnetization - vs - temperature indicates a high curie temperature @xmath46 of the alloy . taking into account that co@xmath0fege fha have four atoms per unit cell and applying the experimental values of the saturation magnetization ( @xmath47 ) at @xmath1=10 k and the lattice parameter one obtains @xmath485.6 @xmath3/f.u .",
    "this value is very close to that predicted by the slater - pauling rule ( _ i.e. _ 6.0 @xmath3/f.u . ) as well as that calculated using the gga+u approach .",
    "it should also be pointed out that co@xmath0fege films have relatively low coercivity , which increases from @xmath4915 oe to 45 oe when the temperature decreases from 300 down to 10 k. this fact implies fine - grain crystalline structure of the samples .    on the basis of the rather good agreement between the experimental and the calculated magnetic moments of co@xmath0fege alloy",
