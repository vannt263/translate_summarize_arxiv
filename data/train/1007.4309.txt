    "theorems it is not enough to consider just one elementary submodel but we should introduce the concept of the _ chains of elementary submodels_.    finally , in section [ sc : bond ] , we give a more elaborate application of chain of elementary submodels to eliminate gch from a theorem concerning bond - faithful decomposition of graphs .",
