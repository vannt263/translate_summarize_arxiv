    "the mystery of the  coldness of the hubble flow \" ( chf ) has remained largely unsolved despite many attempts to explain or reproduce it .",
    "early measurements of the radial velocities of nearby galaxies found the perturbed hubble flow dispersion to be @xmath8 km s@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "recent studies give an even lower value of @xmath9 km s@xmath4 @xcite this dispersion is significantly `` colder '' than theoretical expectations @xcite and observed pairwise velocity dispersions which are of the order of @xmath10 km s@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the scales involving the chf suggest that it has a cosmological origin .",
    "two main causes have been proposed to explain the chf : background cosmology ( in the form of a @xmath11 term ) and local environment .",
    "the influence of background cosmology was first studied in n - body simulations by @xcite who failed to detect low velocity dispersions in two models : @xmath12 ( scdm ) and a @xmath13 ( ocdm ) . a later paper @xcite proposed the role of the cosmological constant in the chf under the assumption that the accelerating effect of @xmath11 or a dark energy term results in a decay in the velocity fluctuations , thereby giving a colder local environment @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "early constrained n - body simulations of the local group suggested that the observed low velocity dispersion somehow reflects our particular local environment @xcite .",
    "this possibility was also explored by @xcite and @xcite who analyzed constrained simulations of the local group in several cosmologies and found the effect of the cosmological constant on local dynamics to be marginal .",
    "while these studies reproduced to some degree cold hubble flows they were not able to identify its origin apart from being an intrinsic property of  local - group \" environments .",
    "from the above discussion , a picture begins to appear : in order to cool the peculiar velocities , an accelerating @xmath11-like component is needed , yet there are strong indications that this does not come from the background cosmology .",
    "this accelerating factor is somehow related to the particular local environment of the milky way .",
    "one may ask under what circumstances one could have a local accelerated expansion without a @xmath11 component .",
    "the most straightforward example is that of cosmological voids .",
    "their low density makes them underdense island universes and their expansion adds to the drag coming from the global hubble expansion as @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "this effect is independent of the background cosmology .",
    "it is purely the result of the particular dynamics of underdense regions and , as we will see in the following section , it is not unique to voids .      in order to describe the role of the local geometry in the lss dynamics",
    "it is illustrative to take a somewhat different approach to the zeldovich collapse of an overdense region @xcite and focus on the draining and expansion of underdense valleys along similar lines as @xcite .",
    "we start by generalizing the notion of a _ void _ as an @xmath15-dimensional valley with @xmath16 corresponding to voids , walls and filaments respectively . in this _ inverse _ dynamical description , matter is drained out of three - dimensional valleys ( voids ) and accumulates in two - dimensional ( void - intersecting ) walls .",
    "these two - dimensional valleys expand and lose their matter into their surrounding one - dimensional ( wall - intersecting ) filaments . finally matter flows out of filaments into zero - dimensional ( filament - intersecting ) clusters .",
    "the dynamics inside a wall can be roughly described as a two - dimensional expanding valley .",
    "an observer situated at the centre of a wall will measure recession velocities @xmath17 of surrounding galaxies as the sum of two components : @xmath18 , where @xmath19 corresponds to the unperturbed hubble flow and the line - of - sight peculiar velocity @xmath20 is decomposed here into a non - linear component @xmath21 coming from small - scale gravitational interactions and a geometrical component @xmath22 originating from the particular dynamics of the local lss geometry where the observer is located . in the case of walls , the local expansion and draining of matter results in @xmath22 being on average positive .",
    "this extra component in the velocity is reflected in _ super - hubble _ flows which further cool down the local velocity fluctuations , producing a _ cold _ dynamical environment .",
    "the milky way is the dominant member of the _ local group _ , a system of galaxies forming a relatively flat pancake @xcite .",
    "extending perpendicular to the plane of the milky way , we find a planar association of galaxies up to @xmath2315 mpc and at its edge the virgo cluster and its filamentary network @xcite .",
    "perpendicular to the local wall , we find the local void extending up to @xmath24 mpc @xcite .",
    "our surrounding lss geometry is consistent with the milky way being inside a wall of radius @xmath25 mpc .",
    "it is interesting to note that the disk of the mw and its neighbours within 10 mpc lie perpendicular to the plane of the local wall in excellent agreement with predictions from tidal torque theory @xcite .",
    "the analysis presented here is based on a dark matter n - body simulation with cosmological parameters @xmath26 and 200 mpc@xmath27 per side .",
    "initial conditions were generated for @xmath28 and @xmath29 particles .",
    "the simulation was run for all particle resolutions from @xmath30 until the present time , @xmath31 using the gadget-2 n - body code @xcite . from the final particle distribution of all resolutions",
    "we compute the density field inside a cubic grid of 512 voxels per dimension using the dtfe method @xcite .",
    "we identify groups in the @xmath32 simulation at @xmath31 using the friends of friends group finder with a linking parameter @xmath33 .",
    "we impose a particle count limit of 100 corresponding to a halo mass of @xmath34 m@xmath35 . for each group , we compute its mass , radius , peculiar velocity , @xmath36 , shape , etc .",
    "we then identify  milky way \" ( mw ) haloes in the mass range @xmath37 m@xmath38 @xmath39 m@xmath40 m@xmath38 and maximum circular velocity @xmath41 km s@xmath4 .",
    "in order to isolate individual walls from the computed density field we performed the hierarchical decomposition into voids , walls and filaments using the spineweb method @xcite extended to the hierarchical formalism described in @xcite . in the hierarchical spineweb framework ,",
    "each hierarchical level is defined by a physical smoothing scale in the linear regime and contains the full network of voids and its complementary web of walls and filaments .",
    "the hierarchical spineweb provides a complete parameter - free characterization of the geometry of the cosmic web . in the present analysis , we computed three hierarchical levels for practical reasons since further levels of substructure tend to be noisy due to resolution effects .",
    "we generate catalogues of walls and filaments and for all pixels in walls we also compute the distance to its closest adjacent filament .",
    "figure [ fig : lic ] illustrates the close relation between lss geometry and local dynamics .",
    "the left panel shows the network of structures found with the spineweb along a thick slice .",
    "a small region containing a face - on wall at its centre is highlighted by a white square and the corresponding density field is shown in the central panel .",
    "note how the substructure inside the wall contrasts with its adjacent empty voids .",
    "even when the density of the wall is very low ( @xmath42 ) it is denser than the interior of its adjacent voids which appear completely dark in the central panel .",
    "the right panel shows the dynamics inside the central wall .",
    "we visualize the velocity field using the line integral convolution ( lic ) technique @xcite .",
    "the velocity field shown here corresponds to the _ residual velocity _",
    "field @xmath43 at a scale @xmath44 defined as : @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the original velocity field decomposed in its three components and @xmath47 is its convolution with a gaussian kernel of scale @xmath48 mpc@xmath27 . the velocity flows delineated by the lic streams closely resemble the inverse dynamical description given in section [ sec : lss_dynamics ] : matter flows out of walls into their adjacent filaments and from there to the clusters .",
    "the outflow pattern at the interior of walls is remarkably coherent and offers a geometric origin for an extra expansion factor .",
    "this outflow is simply the result of the lss geometry - dynamics as such it is independent of the background cosmology .",
    "having defined the halo catalog we proceed to select those halos inside walls and filaments .",
    "central mw halos in walls were restricted to be at least 3 mpc away from their closest filament .",
    "no restriction was imposed on the neighbour haloes , except @xmath41 km s@xmath49 .",
    "we also computed the local density fluctuation ( @xmath50 ) around each halo from the dark matter density distribution using a gaussian kernel with @xmath51 mpc .",
    "we defined low ( @xmath52 ) and high ( @xmath53 ) density environments roughly corresponding to voids - walls and filaments - clusters respectively ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lic ] ) . for each mw",
    "halo we compute line - of - sight velocities as @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the unit vector between the central mw halo and its neighbour halo and @xmath56 is the relative velocity between the two haloes .",
    "the radial velocity is then used to compute the distance - velocity diagrams described in the following sections .",
    "the hubble flow for haloes in walls is shown in the distance - velocity diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig : hubble_walls ] for three increasingly cold and super - hubble cases ( compare to fig .",
    "[ fig : hubble_filaments ] ) .",
    "the flow for haloes in walls ( left panel ) has a mean velocity dispersion of @xmath57 km s@xmath4 in the range @xmath58 mpc after which point we observe a broadening in the dispersion up to @xmath59 km s@xmath4 at @xmath60 mpc .",
    "the ratio between the simulated and observed mean dispersions is @xmath61 .",
    "when the low - density condition is included ( central panel ) the hubble flow becomes significantly colder with @xmath62 km s@xmath4 at @xmath58 mpc .",
    "the broadening in @xmath63 at larger distances is also smaller with @xmath64 km s@xmath4 at @xmath65 mpc and the ratio between mean dispersions is @xmath66 .",
    "the agreement of this particular sample and the observed galaxy population is remarkable with very similar dispersion across the full range of the diagram and even showing the same broadening at @xmath67 mpc .",
    "finally , if one further restricts the neighbour haloes to be located in the same parent wall as the central mw halo ( right panel ) we then have the extreme case of _ super - cold _ flows with mean velocity dispersion @xmath68 km s@xmath4 in the range @xmath58 mpc .",
    "the low velocity dispersion is observed even at the boundaries of the largest walls in our sample with @xmath69 km s@xmath4 at @xmath65 mpc .",
    "the dispersion in this sample is significantly lower than the observed by almost a factor of two ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "the internal expansion of the walls is also observed in the distance velocity diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig : hubble_walls ] .",
    "the flow for haloes in all cases is sub - hubble at small scales @xmath71 mpc reflecting the decelerating influence of the central halo . for haloes in walls",
    "( left panel ) the flow is marginally super - hubble at @xmath72 mpc . once we include the low - density condition ( central panel ) the super - hubble character of the flow becomes more clear . at distances @xmath73 mpc we have a _ local _",
    "hubble constant of @xmath74 .",
    "when we consider only neighbour haloes inside the same parent wall ( right panel ) , then the effect of the local lss geometry - dynamics dominates the distance - velocity diagram .",
    "the local hubble constant is @xmath75 at scales @xmath73 mpc , which is @xmath76 larger than the global hubble constant given by the background cosmology ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "this local hubble constant is also significantly larger than the expected for galaxies inside voids where @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "we explored the effect of the local geometry - dynamics on the radius at which no recession velocity is measured ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "this radius depends to first order on the mass of the central halo as @xmath80 .",
    "the value of @xmath79 is basically independent of the local density ( see fig . [",
    "fig : hubble_filaments ] , left and central panels ) at @xmath81 mpc .",
    "however , when one divides the mw halo sample in terms of their surrounding lss geometry , the effect of the local lss dynamics emerges . for mw halos in walls @xmath82 mpc ( see fig . [",
    "fig : hubble_walls ] ) .",
    "this reflects the fact that neighbour haloes recede faster than the global hubble flow , thus making the central halo appear less massive .",
    "the difference in mass from no lss - geometry distinction and haloes in walls is @xmath83 . without considering the local geometry for central halos in walls ,",
    "one can underestimate its mass by as much as @xmath84 .",
    "an extreme example of the effect of local geometry - dynamics on the value of @xmath79 is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : hubble_filaments ] where we computed the distance - velocity diagram for central haloes located in filaments and high density regions and considering _ only _ neighbouring haloes located in walls .",
    "this case is the opposite dynamically to the one of haloes in walls .",
    "the infall of haloes in filaments along the adjacent walls is reflected in the extremely high value of @xmath79 .",
    "this effect is independent of the mass of the central halo ( compare to the central panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : hubble_filaments ] ) and if used to estimate the mass of the central mw halo can overestimate its mass by a factor of @xmath85 compared to the low and high density samples ( left and central panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : hubble_filaments ] ) and @xmath86 compared to haloes in walls .      figure [ fig : hubble_filaments ] shows the effect of local density on the distance - velocity diagram .",
    "low density regions ( left panel ) have low velocity dispersions with @xmath87 km s@xmath4 in the range @xmath88 mpc .",
    "the value of @xmath63 remains relatively constant for all distances .",
    "the mean velocity converges to the global hubble flow at @xmath89 mpc .",
    "high density regions are sub - hubble and significantly hotter with @xmath90 km s@xmath4 going as high as @xmath91 km@xmath92s at @xmath60 mpc .",
    "the coldness of the local hubble flow is a longstanding problem in @xmath11cdm cosmology .",
    "we have shown that by taking account of the void / wall / filament nature of large - scale structure , one can naturally reproduce the observed low dispersion in the local hubble flow for galaxies located in local - group lss configurations , corresponding to walls .",
    "the dispersion of the local hubble flow ( @xmath2 mpc ) around simulated  milky way \" haloes which are located at the centre of low - density cosmological walls is found to be @xmath330 km s@xmath4 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hubble_walls ] , central panel ) , in excellent agreement with observations .",
    "the expansion inside walls is also reflected in the enhanced value of the measured _ local _ hubble constant . for  milky way \" haloes inside walls , we find super - hubble flows with @xmath5 .",
    "ignoring the dynamical effects of the local wall , the mass of the milky way estimated from r@xmath6 can be underestimated by as much as @xmath7 . in a future paper",
    "we will extend our study to include voids and filaments .",
    "the strong constraint on the lss dynamics imposed by the complementary lss geometry can also be exploited to improve current techniques of velocity field reconstruction .",
    "a full lss morphological decomposition of the local supercluster can allow us to obtain a more complete characterization of our local velocity field .",
