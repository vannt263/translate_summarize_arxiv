    "a quasi - periodicity route to turbulence due to ruelle and takens @xcite is that transition could occur via three successive hopf bifurcations , leading from a fixed point to a limit cycle , then to a torus and finally to a 3-torus . on the other hand ,",
    "double periodicity is considered to be well modeled by the one dimensional sine - circle map , which indicates that frequency - locking and periodic solutions appear as the nonlinear parameter increases .",
    "therefore , it is a natural question what actually happens on attractors of a simple set of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) having double periodicity , like the langford equation @xcite .",
    "similar numerical studies have been done for the five dimensional odes modeling magnetoconvection @xcite and the six dimensional odes of the gledzer shell model of turbulence @xcite . in the latter case",
    "the parameter to be changed is the viscosity , or equivalently , the reynolds number .",
    "both studies show a bifurcation structure very similar to that of the sine - circle map , although triple periodicity is stated based on the numerically obtained lyapunov exponents in @xcite .",
    "the presented results correspond to a detailed study that extends langford @xcite .    in section 2 , a method to construct the three dimensional poincar section is proposed . for triple periodicity expected by ruelle and",
    "takens @xcite , points lie on a surface .",
    "frequency - locked double periodicity indicates points on a closed curve embedded on the surface .",
    "section 3 gives the langford equation with an explanation of the evolution of the energy and selected parameters . in section 4 , numerical results of bifurcation structures of the equation are shown .",
    "it is confirmed that , instead of triple periodicity , we have double periodicity , frequency - locking and period - doubling bifurcations .",
    "the structure is very complicated ; frequency - locking corresponding to the farey sequence with the index up to 14 is confirmed , and plural sequences of the period - doubling bifurcations are observed . summary and further possibilities to explore complexity of dynamical systems modeling fluid dynamics and other high dimensional systems with the presented approach are described in conclusions .",
    "as a typical example of triple periodicity , we consider the following function which is a sum of three sinusoidal functions of @xmath3 ;    @xmath4    a standard method to construct the poincar map used in @xcite is to seek for successive local maxima @xmath5 of @xmath6",
    ". then we let @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( mod 1 ) . for double periodicity",
    ", @xmath9 obeys the generalized sine - circle map @xcite , which gives a curve on the @xmath10 plane .",
    "similarly , we can anticipate a surface in the @xmath11 space . to check this analogy",
    ", we show the poincar plot of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) in the time interval @xmath12 for double periodicity @xmath13 in figure 1 , triple periodicity @xmath14 in figure 2 , and frequency - locked double periodicity @xmath15 in figure 3 .",
    "points lie on a curve in figure 1 ( a ) and on a torus in figure 2 ( a ) , whose three dimensional structure can be viewed by a new 3d graphics function in _ mathematica _ 6 .",
    "the latter indicates a possibility that @xmath16 can be expressed by a function of @xmath9 and @xmath17 . this poincar plot will give a method to identify triple periodicity among complicated time series of general numerical or observed data .",
    "we have 5:7 frequency - locking in the case of figure 3 .",
    "correspondingly , points are again on a curve , which is more complicated than that in figure 1",
    ". actual data may contain higher harmonics in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) but the qualitative behavior can be expected to be similar .",
    "the langford equation is the set of three ordinary differential equations for @xmath18 , @xmath19 , given as follows : @xmath20    the temporal evolution of the _ energy _ defined by @xmath21 is given by    @xmath22    the set of the parameters fixed in this paper is borrowed from @xcite as @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the changing parameter . because @xmath25 and @xmath26 , the right hand side of ( [ eq5 ] ) becomes negative if @xmath27 is sufficiently large for @xmath28 , leading to the proof that the solution is finite . if @xmath29 , the finiteness of the solution is unknown but supported by the numerical solution for small @xmath24 .",
    "the contraction rate of the volume element in the phase space is given by @xmath30 it depends on the position in the phase space .",
    "if @xmath28 , it becomes negative for sufficiently large values of @xmath27 since @xmath31 is positive and the quadratic terms become dominant .",
    "before we show numerical results of the langford equation , it is useful to review the bifurcation structure of the sine - circle map : @xmath32 in order to compare the diagram of ( [ eq8 ] ) with that of the langford equation , the parameter @xmath33 and @xmath34 are parametrized as @xmath35 the initial condition is @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , the total iteration is 400 , and the last 200 steps are plotted in figure 4 .",
    "although double periodicity and frequency - locking are illustrated by the sine - circle map in many literatures , the period - doubling bifurcation is also observed at @xmath39 in figure 4 , which can make it easy to understand the similarity of the bifurcation structures between the sine - circle map and the langford equation .",
    "the coexistence of two scenarios of routes to turbulence , quasi periodicity and period - doubling bifurcation , may be common in many of dynamical systems .    in order to study bifurcation structures of the langford equation , sets of @xmath0 at its local maximum after transient states are plotted with various values of the parameter @xmath24 .",
    "( [ eq2]-[eq4 ] ) are solved by _ ndsolve _ command in _ mathematica _ 5.2 , which makes 100 to 500 different computations possible in a single program .",
    "the typical final time is @xmath40 and the last period @xmath41 with @xmath42 is picked up to identify attractors . in order to find the local maximum ,",
    "the time period is divided into intervals with the width @xmath43 , and for the interval which can include the local maximum , the _ findmaximum _ command is invoked .",
    "the typical initial condition for the numerical computation is @xmath44 .",
    "we also choose the initial condition as the final state just before the parameter varied in order to examine the hysteresis .",
    "in some cases , multiple stable states are observed .",
    "about 40 different runs are performed with various regions of @xmath24 and suitable numerical parameters .",
    "figure 5 shows the bifurcation diagram for the parameter range @xmath45 .",
    "the step of the parameter @xmath24 is @xmath46 .",
    "the region @xmath47 includes doubly periodic solutions .",
    "then 3:4 frequency - locking yields the periodic solution .",
    "the feigenbaum period - doubling bifurcation occurs at @xmath48 .",
    "there are many periodic windows as well as chaotic solutions after the period - doubling bifurcation .",
    "its behavior is very similar to that of the one dimensional logistic map .",
    "the range @xmath49 is enlarged in figure 6 , in order to see the most dominant frequency - locked periodic solutions .",
    "the solution is doubly periodic if @xmath50 , even if @xmath24 is negative .",
    "as @xmath24 increases , a periodic solution with 17:23 resonance appears at @xmath51 .",
    "periodic solutions shown by @xmath52 points are specified by the resonance condition @xmath53 drawn at just below the upper frame of figure 6 .",
    "the region including double periodicity ends with the emergence of 3:4 resonance at @xmath54 .",
    "doubly periodic solutions draw points whose numbers are controlled by the time range for plotting and typically much larger than the periodic solutions .    the farey sequence @xmath1 for integers @xmath55 is the set of irreducible rational numbers @xmath56 where @xmath57 and the greatest common divisor of @xmath58 and @xmath59 is 1 .",
    "the farey sequence appears in frequency - locking of the sine - circle map .",
    "the resonance conditions between 17:23 and 3:4 are shown up to the farey index @xmath2 in table 1 .",
    "for the 23:31 resonant periodic solution , an incomplete period - doubling bifurcation is observed in figure 6 .",
    "figure 7 shows the diagram enlarged for @xmath60 .",
    "figure 8 shows the diagram for @xmath61 .",
    "the period - doubling bifurcations observed on both of the two parameter regions of 43:58 resonance .    the periodicity can be also judged by numerical computation of the square of the minimum distance @xmath62 indicating the accuracy of recurrence . in figure 9 for @xmath63",
    ", the small value of @xmath64 indicates frequency - locked periodicity including resonances corresponding to @xmath65 ( 35:47 ) and @xmath66 ( 38:51 and 93:125 ) of @xmath1 .",
    "the width of resonance decreases as the index @xmath67 of @xmath1 increases , that implies scaling laws as noted by @xcite .",
    "summary of observed stable periodic windows is given in table 2 .",
    "figure 10 shows the parameter @xmath24 versus the farey index @xmath67 for the periodic windows .",
