    "the tremendous success of collaborative filtering - based recommendation systems ( see e.g.  @xcite ) in online retail settings ( e.g. netflix ) has demonstrated that users welcome guidance while looking for books to buy or films to rent i.e. where they are not looking for a product which satisfies a general specification rather than a specific product . in the enterprise search space , the increasing importance of faceted search - essentially a method of providing recommendations to satisfy",
    "a user s search needs by creating multiple taxonomies - pioneered by endeca  @xcite , under the name `` guided navigation '' , shows that businesses are recognizing that they can improve profitability by effectively helping their employees and customers browse through large databases by providing search results related to the ones users express a preference for .",
    "but search engines for the world wide web have been largely unsuccessful in providing accurate and helpful recommendations to their users .",
    "research has found that most web users are not using advanced features provided by search engines ; it has been shown that they barely understand what these features do  @xcite .",
    "further , it has been seen that web users search less and browse more  @xcite .",
    "and , in fact , the process of developing expertise in using the web coincides with an increase in browsing and decrease in searching  @xcite .",
    "despite this bleak scenario it is our contention that search engines have the resources to effectively provide users with related pages that can help in information - gathering tasks .",
    "further we believe that a search engine which can do this will increase its value for its users , with consequent increases in revenue .",
    "there is a growing understanding in the search domain that user intent is crucial to the search process  @xcite .",
    "extending this understanding to the domain of relationships between pages can make information - gathering tasks easier .",
    "in other words , to know the relationship between two pages , we must first know what function these two pages serve for the users who visit them .",
    "it is only by characterizing the task the user is engaged in that we can offer related pages and hope that these will actually facilitate the task . in this paper",
    "we provide a suite of scoring mechanisms that relate web pages : _ seekrel _ , _ factrel _ and _ surfrel_. the purpose of these scoring mechanisms is to help identify pages which may be related to the current page depending on whether the user is reading pages which provide information , seeking links to sources of information , or surfing through pages as part of an extended information - gathering process .",
    "a brief overview of our method is as follows : we compute our scores using flow calculations in a set of subnetworks of the web .",
    "each subnetwork corresponds to a single keyword .",
    "the set of subnetworks used to score a pair of pages is decided by finding the keywords relevant to the pair of pages being scored",
    ". then the edges of these networks are capacitated using the hub values  @xcite of their originating pages .",
    "finally flow is sent along these edges towards special nodes we call _ witnesses_. the amount of flow that can be routed is used as a measure of the relationship .",
    "* organization . * in section  [ sec : ig ]",
    "we focus on information - gathering tasks and identify how our recommendations can facilitate them .",
    "we survey previous work done in relating web pages in section  [ sec : related ] .",
    "our specific scoring mechanisms are described in sections  [ sec : algorithm : graph ] and  [ sec : algorithm : flow ] . a comparison of our results for a small toy network with the results produced by two recent proposals _ pagesim _",
    "@xcite and _ simrank _",
    "@xcite is presented in section  [ sec : algorithm : discuss ] . in section  [ sec",
    ": experiments ] we present experiments conducted on real data taken from the web .",
    "we discuss the results of user surveys that compared the top results produced by our scoring mechanisms with the results given by the _ companion _",
    "algorithm of dean and henzinger  @xcite and google s similar pages feature . finally in section  [ sec : discussion ]",
    ", we conclude by discussing the merits of our scheme in comparison to these two proposals and by arguing that our scheme is a better candidate for inclusion in a search engine than the _ companion _ algorithm .",
    "the tasks that web users undertake were classified by broder  @xcite to generally fall into three categories : navigational ( finding specific pages ) , informational ( seeking facts ) and transactional ( performing some interactive set of tasks . ) kellar  @xcite further classifies informational tasks into information - seeking , information exchange and information maintenance tasks .",
    "it is in the first of these classes , information seeking , that search engines make their major contributions .",
    "kellar differentiates between three types of information seeking tasks : _ fact - finding _ e.g. directions to a friend s house or exam dates , _ information - gathering _",
    "e.g. tectonic movements , mac laptops , _ browsing _ news , friend s homepage .",
    "see figure  [ fig : kellar - classification ] for a schematic representation of kellar s classification ( source  @xcite . )",
    "our focus is on information - gathering which we distinguish from fact finding by using kellar s definition : _ information - gathering consists of tasks in which a user is collecting information , often from multiple sources , in order to write a report , make a decision , or become more informed about a particular topic _  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* pp 67 ) . with this definition in hand",
    "let us try to characterize this class of tasks .      in their seminal work belkin , oddy and brooks",
    "@xcite pointed out that assuming that a user with a need for information will be able to specify that need exactly is a mistake .",
    "instead , they pointed out that a user comes to an information retrieval system with an _ anomalous state of knowledge _ , which she then attempts to express as a query . based on the information received the anomaly is rectified to some extent , the user s image of the world is altered somewhat .",
    "but this is not the end of the process .",
    "the altered state of the user s knowledge generates new anomalies which she then takes back to the information retrieval engine in the form of requests or queries .",
    "this iterative process continues till the user is satisfied with the extent of the change in his state of knowledge .",
    "belkin et .",
    "al.s work has been refined in several directions ( we refer the reader to marchioni s book for a survey  @xcite ) but the general view remains a powerful organizing principle for information retrieval .",
    "this general view is borne out in the world wide web setting by rose s conclusion  @xcite - based on earlier studies he and levinson conducted  @xcite - that information search was an iterative process .",
    "other supporting evidence in this regard is aula et .",
    "al.s finding that experienced web user s showed a pattern of searching , then browsing , the searching again  @xcite , which was similar to cothey s finding in a longitudinal study that followed subjects evolving from novice to expert  @xcite .    with all of this as background",
    "we characterize the information gathering task on the world wide web as an iterative one ( see figure  [ fig : ig - iterative ] ) .",
    "this task is initiated by an understanding that the user s knowledge needs to be augmented , proceeds by looking for web pages ( either from search engines or other sources ) and then browsing them when they are found .",
    "the process of browsing rectifies the knowledge anomaly partially or wholly and has the additional effect of providing links to other pages which might aid the process .",
    "the user may then choose to follow those other links ( immediately or later ) or finish browsing the current page .",
    "when a page is browsed completely the user is either satisfied entirely and terminates the task , or is partially satisfied and resumes the task by again looking for web pages .",
    "this iterative characterizations of the information - gathering tasks suggests ways in which search engines could aid users in performing them .",
    "it is to this that we now turn our attention .      in figure",
    "[ fig : ig - iterative ] we notice that a user browsing a web page in the process of gathering information treats the page either as a source of information or as a source of links to other pages .",
    "it is therefore appropriate to provide users with links to two kinds of pages :    * p1 . * pages which contain information similar to the current page .",
    "pages which provide links similar to the links provided by the current page .",
    "additionally it is our contention that as user experience with the web improves , there will be the realization that people who create web content and web links have an understanding of the interrelationships between various pages .",
    "and so we suggest that a third kind of page could be useful in the information - gathering process :    * p3 .",
    "* pages which can be reached by following a sequence of links from the current page and pages from which the current page can be reached by following a sequence of links .    the specifications * p1 * and * p2 * are general and open to interpretation as to how they might be satisfied",
    ". the pages of * p3 * are more specific but there is still the question of which one of these pages to choose to present to the user from among the several thousand that might satisfy this criterion . in section  [ sec : algorithm ] we will provide three scoring mechanisms : _ factrel _ will account for pages of type * p1 * , _ seekrel _ for * p2 * and _ surfrel _ for * p3*.    how should these links be provided to the user ? while this is a question better addressed by experts in human - computer interaction , we would suggest that the `` toolbars '' provided by many search engines could be augmented to provide page recommendations .",
    "these already provide information about the `` rank '' of the page currently being viewed and various other pieces of information from the search engine s bag , and this additional use can fit in seamlessly . for searches that take place on a search engine s web page , each `` similar pages '' link can contain these related pages . in either case",
    "it is of paramount importance that the links provided be appropriately categorized so that the user can choose to follow them ( or not ) depending on the particular function the page being viewed ( or the initial search result ) plays in her information - gathering process .",
    "the relationship between web pages has been studied fairly extensively .",
    "most researchers use the term `` similarity '' and define it variously . in this paper",
    "we have consciously avoided the use of this term since we believe that the relationship between web pages is not intrinsic to the pages but depends on the functionality of the pages for the user . however , in order to survey previous contributions to this area , in this section we will use the term `` similarity . ''",
    "there are two broad categories of approaches to the web page similarity problem .",
    "the first relies mainly on the textual content of web pages .",
    "the pair of pages being compared is either seen just as two groups of items ( keywords , anchor text , patterns in the text ) which overlap significantly or as structured entities that resemble each other in their organization e.g. which tags appear next to which ones .",
    "since this is not our approach we do not review this vast literature here , referring the reader to  @xcite for a succinct survey .",
    "the second approach involves taking link and interconnection information into account . an important way in which interconnection has been used is to ascribe authority to a page based on which pages link to it .",
    "this idea forms the basis of the pagerank algorithm employed by google  @xcite . in a similar vein ,",
    "kleinberg  @xcite described two attributes of web pages : they can be _ authorities _ on a topic , or they can be _ hubs _ , linking to pages which are authoritative .",
    "he described an iterative algorithm to compute measures of these two attributes for each web page .",
    "one line along which kleinberg s work was developed involved using anchor text as a descriptive summary of the page being linked to  @xcite .",
    "but , more relevant to our methods was the focus on the link structure seen in dean and henzinger s paper  @xcite where they gave two algorithms for finding similar web pages .",
    "one of their algorithms used the idea of co - citation earlier seen in pitkow and pirolli s work  @xcite .",
    "the second algorithm , called _ companion _ shares an important feature with our scoring mechanisms : it uses kleinberg s algorithm .",
    "their method of building a focused graph extends kleinberg s ideas .",
    "we have used their ideas for building capacitated subnetworks in our algorithm . while dean and henzinger give a list of pages similar to a given page , huang et .",
    "@xcite gave measures of similarity based on the predecessor and successor set , and also on the basis of all the vertices reachable from the two pages .",
    "another sort of `` closure '' of co - citation was used to define a similarity measure called _ pagesim _ in  @xcite . in this measure , pages propagate their similarity measure to their neighbors , the importance of a particular propagation being decided by the pagerank of the page .",
    "this measure was an improvement on the _ simrank _ measure proposed in  @xcite which worked on the principle that two pages are similar if they are linked to by similar pages .",
    "the _ simrank _",
    "measure was shown to be specific instance of a general framework for computing similarity between heterogeneous data objects by xi et .",
    "@xcite who proposed the _",
    "simfusion _ algorithm . in section  [ sec : algorithm : discuss ] we will compare the results _ pagesim _ and _ simrank _ produce on a small toy example with the results given by our scoring mechanisms .    in a different use of link structure related to our own lu et .",
    "@xcite claimed that two pages were said to be similar if flow could be routed from one of them to the other .",
    "however , unlike our work , their capacity assignments were not based on any notion of authority . to the best of our knowledge",
    "this is the only other mention of using flow to score similarity in the literature .",
    "as mentioned , the literature on finding similarity is vast and has seen contributions from many different areas .",
    "the papers we have discussed above are the ones whose techniques are closely related to our own . with these in view",
    "we now proceed to describing our scoring mechanisms .",
    "in this section we describe our algorithms for scoring the relationships between a pair of pages @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "it is our contention that two pages should have a high _ factrel _ score if it is possible to find paths from multiple pages to both of them .",
    "we say that a page @xmath2 _ witnesses _ the _ factrel _ relationship between @xmath0 and @xmath1 if it is possible to reach both @xmath0 and @xmath1 from @xmath2 by following a series of links .",
    "for example , in figure  [ fig : witness - example ] , the page @xmath3 witnesses _ factrel _ between @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "similarly we say that a page @xmath2 witnesses the _ seekrel _ relationship if it is possible to reach @xmath2 by following a series of links from @xmath0 to @xmath2 and @xmath1 to @xmath2 .",
    "for example , in figure  [ fig : witness - example ] , @xmath6 witnesses _ seekrel _ between @xmath3 and @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 is another such witness for these two .",
    "somewhat differently , the _ surfrel _ relationship does not require explicit witnesses .",
    "we say that the _ surfrel _ relationship exists between @xmath0 and @xmath1 if it is possible to reach @xmath0 from @xmath1 by following a series of links , or vice versa . in figure",
    "[ fig : witness - example ] , we see that @xmath9 and @xmath5 are related this way , while @xmath4 and @xmath7 , are _ not _ related by _",
    "surfrel_.    hence our scores are based on finding paths in the world wide web .",
    "but which paths should be given more weight than others in the scoring process ? to answer this question we rely on kleinberg s notion  @xcite of _ authorities _ ( pages which have credible information ) and _ hubs _ ( pages which link to good authorities ) in order to derive a relevant set of focused capacitated subnetworks from the structure of the world wide web .",
    "we then determine relationship scores by sending flow _ to _ the two pages _ from _ witnesses ( for _ factrel _ ) , _ from _ the two pages _ to _ witnesses ( for _ seekrel _ ) or _ between _ the pages ( for _ surfrel _ ) in these capacitated networks .",
    "we will now discuss these methods in detail .",
    "in section  [ sec : algorithm : graph ] we will describe how to build our set of capacitated subnetworks using kleinberg s method for assigning authority to web pages . in section  [ sec : algorithm : flow ] we describe how to find witnesses , route flow and compute scores .",
    "we illustrate the working of the algorithm on a toy example in section  [ sec : algorithm : discuss ] and also present a comparison by scoring _ simrank _",
    "@xcite and _ pagesim _",
    "@xcite on the same example .",
    "we begin by assuming that we have a database of significant keywords , call it @xmath10 .",
    "we also assume that there is some function @xmath11 which assigns relative importance to these keywords .",
    "we do not specify how to build @xmath12 , preferring to rely on the wealth of tools available for this purpose ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "for each of these keywords we apply kleinberg s  @xcite hits algorithm to compute hub and authority values for all the pages associated with that keyword . finally , at the end of this preprocessing step each page has hub and authority values computed for the subset of the database of keywords it is associated with .",
    "when we are given a pair of pages to score we identify sets of significant keywords @xmath13 and @xmath14 for @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we then merge these two sets to get the top @xmath15 keywords for some tunable parameter @xmath15 .",
    "this set of chosen keywords we call @xmath12 .",
    "once we have this set of keywords we proceed by making a set of networks @xmath16 . for each @xmath17",
    "we first find the set of web pages @xmath18 which contains the keyword @xmath19 .",
    "since we will be using kleinberg s hub and authority values  @xcite to capacitate the network ( in section  [ sec : algorithm : flow ] ) we grow @xmath17 by first taking all the pages that link to the pages in @xmath18 and the pages that are linked to by the pages in @xmath18 ( as described in  @xcite ) .",
    "then we add the refinements to this structure proposed by dean and henzinger  @xcite .",
    "only the main feature of these refinements has been mentioned in steps  [ step : dean ] and  [ step : dean2 ] .",
    "the reader is referred to  @xcite for further details .    finally , for each network @xmath17 we run kleinberg s algorithm for assigning hub and authority values to each page and label a node @xmath2 of network @xmath17 with these values : @xmath20 and @xmath21 . a directed edge from node @xmath22 to node @xmath23",
    "is assigned capacity @xmath24 .",
    "a summary of the algorithm is in figure  [ fig : algorithm : construct ] .",
    "we postpone a discussion of the motivation for this construction to section  [ sec : algorithm : discuss ] .      * finding witnesses .",
    "* for both _",
    "seekrel _ and _ factrel _ we have to find witnesses in each @xmath17 . in figure",
    "[ fig : algorithm : witnesses ] we describe a simple algorithm that uses breadth - first search from both @xmath0 and @xmath1 upto @xmath25 levels for some value of @xmath25 to return a sorted list , @xmath26 , of witnesses for _",
    "seekrel_. note that we do not just create a set of witnesses , but actually make an ordered list of witnesses .",
    "the significance of this will become clear shortly . in order to construct a list of witnesses for _ factrel _ we simply reverse the direction of all the edges of @xmath17 and execute exactly the same algorithm .",
    "we denote the set of witnesses for _ factrel _ by @xmath27 .",
    "note that the reversal of edges is only to find witnesses , not to compute flows , that takes place on the same graph for both _",
    "seekrel _ and _",
    "factrel_.    * computing flows . *",
    "having constructed the ordered list of witnesses we go down the list one vertex at a time using any standard single - source maximum flow algorithm for computing the max flow first from @xmath0 to or from the witness as required , then from @xmath1 .",
    "note that when computing the flow from @xmath0 to a witness we eliminate @xmath1 from the network and vice versa .",
    "this is to ensure that the one page does nt piggyback on the other in order to route flow to a witness i.e. all the flow @xmath1 sends to a witness is independent of @xmath0 and vice versa .",
    "after computing the flow for a particular witness , we reduce the capacity of the edges into or out of the witness .",
    "let us postpone discussing the rationale and method for this to the end of this section .",
    "we then move on to the next witness in the list .",
    "see figure  [ fig : algorithm : seekflow ] for a formal description of the algorithm for computing flows for _ seekrel_. the algorithm for computing flows for _ factrel _ is symmetric . in this case",
    "we denote the flow from a witness @xmath22 as @xmath28 .    * the scores .",
    "* in order to compute the relationship scores we have to be able to combine flows from different subnetworks .",
    "in order to do this we normalize all flows by dividing by the weight of the maximum edge in the network , a quantity we denote by @xmath29 . also , we factor in the relative importance of the various keywords in @xmath12 using the function @xmath30 .",
    "hence our first two scores are    the rationale behind _ factrel _ is that pages providing similar information will be identified by witnesses in the network , which act collaboratively to identify good sources of information and link to them .",
    "similarly , the intuition between _ seekrel _ is that two pages which allow a user to reach more or less the same pages are related in terms of their ability to guide the user as she navigates the web .    the third measure , _ surfrel _ is easier to compute since it requires no witnesses .",
    "we simply compute the max flow from @xmath0 to @xmath1 in @xmath17 , denoting it @xmath31 and the flow from @xmath1 to @xmath0 , denoted @xmath32 .",
    "now , we can say that    _ surfrel _ encapsulates the idea that if the web allows one page to reach another through a simple sequence of clicks , these two pages must be related because they are both likely to be visited in a single browsing session .",
    "this idea of two pages being related by the presence of a path between them is very intuitive and the concept of flow generalizes the idea of paths . by capacitating edges with the hub value of the nodes they originate at , we differentiate between nodes and their ability to allow information to propagate by looking at their credibility as hubs in the hyperlinked environment .",
    "the more the credibility of the node as a hub , the more the flow it can forward .    * reducing witness capacity .",
    "* in the case of _ seekrel _ and _ factrel _ , the presence of many witnesses that can sink or source a lot of flow from the two pages being scored ( or send a lot of flow to them ) leads to a higher score for the pair .",
    "but there are cases where this score may be artificially high .",
    "consider the network in figure  [ fig : redundant - witness ] .",
    "@xmath33 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath3 all witness _ seekrel _ for @xmath9 and @xmath7 .",
    "but the flow to @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath3 all goes through @xmath33 .",
    "so these three are redundant , in the sense that the information they provide is already contained in the fact that @xmath33 is a witness for @xmath9 and @xmath7 .",
    "it is to prevent these redundant witnesses from artificially inflating the relationship score that we reduce the capacity associated with the witness in step  [ step : reduce ] of the flow computing algorithm of figure  [ fig : algorithm : seekflow ] . for _ seekrel",
    "_ when we are done computing flow to a witness we reduce its incoming capacity before moving on to the next witness in the list . for _ factrel",
    "_ the outgoing capacity is reduced .",
    "before we describe the algorithm formally in figure  [ fig : algorithm : reduce ] let us define some notation . for a vertex @xmath22 let the set of incoming edges be @xmath34 and the set of outgoing edges be @xmath35 .",
    "let the flow routed for vertex @xmath0 on edge @xmath36 be @xmath37 .",
    "the capacity of edge @xmath36 is @xmath38 .",
    "essentially what reduceseekcapacity(@xmath22 ) does is remove the amount of flow witnessed at @xmath22 .",
    "since we take the minimum of @xmath39 and @xmath40 as the amount of flow being witnessed , we remove this amount from the incoming capacity of @xmath22 . and",
    "to ensure we do this fairly for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we penalize the incoming edges used by both the flows @xmath39 and @xmath40 equally by scaling down the larger flow to the smaller one before subtracting it from the capacity of the incoming edge .",
    "the algorithm reduceflowcapacity(@xmath22 ) is symmetric to this , only it removes capacity from the outgoing edges of the witness . in both these cases , with the witness capacity reduced , the ability of redundant witnesses to skew the flow reduces .",
    "the reason for fixing an ordering for our witnesses becomes clear now since the capacities of the network decrease after each flow calculation .",
    "clearly the order in which the witnesses are processed will make a difference to the flow that is routed to them .",
    "recall the function @xmath41 defined in figure  [ fig : algorithm : witnesses ] as the number of hops in a directed path from @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "let us see what the values of @xmath42 are for @xmath43 and @xmath44 . for @xmath3",
    "this is ( 3,2 ) , for @xmath6 it is ( 2,1 ) , for @xmath5 it is ( 1,2 ) and for @xmath33 it is ( 1,1 ) .",
    "so the sorted order according to our algorithm should be @xmath33 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath3 .",
    "for this the total flow witnessed will be 10 units for @xmath33 plus 20 units for @xmath5 = 30 units .",
    "because of capacity reduction @xmath6 and @xmath3 will not be able to witness any flow .",
    "but is this correct given that @xmath7 has a direct edge to @xmath6 which does nt go through @xmath5 or @xmath33 ?",
    "we argue it is since the flow of 30 that could be witnessed at @xmath6 is the same as the flow of 30 units that is being witnessed for @xmath9 at @xmath5 and @xmath33 . in figure",
    "[ fig : redundant - witness ] for example , if we choose the witnesses in the reverse order @xmath45 the total flow is 30 witnessed by @xmath33 + 30 witnessed by @xmath6 + 30 witnessed by @xmath5 + 10 witnessed by @xmath33 , totalling 100 , of which 70 units are redundant .    thus it follows that distant witnesses along a chain of nodes are more likely to be redundant since decreasing their capacity will not affect the flow to nearer witnesses . with this in mind , and also noting that more information about a web page is likely to be found in its near neighborhood rather than far away from it , we order witnesses in increasing order of the distance of the witness from one of the pages in ( step  [ step : sort ] of algorithm makeseekwitnesslist(@xmath46 ) in figure  [ fig : algorithm : witnesses ] . if a distant witness still witnesses flow after the reduction of capacity of nearer witnesses , we can be sure that this is not redundant flow .",
    "we took the simple subnetwork of figure  [ fig : simrank - example ] and ran our scoring algorithms on it .",
    "the table of scores obtained is in figure  [ fig : toy - table ] .",
    "for cleanness of presentation all hub values have been scaled by 1000 .",
    "the flow values have been scaled up by @xmath47 since we are only considering one subnetwork .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the user response to _ surfrel _ was fairly good .",
    "almost half of our top ten results were found relevant by the respondents ( see figure  [ fig : surf - relevance - precision ] ) .",
    "our scoring mechanisms are designed with a view to integrate the two broad streams of thought on web page relationships : textual and link - based .",
    "this goes some way in addressing lawrence and giles criticism that search engines are biased towards pages which are well - linked  @xcite and is hence an advantage over algorithms like dean and henzinger s _ companion _ which take only link information into consideration .",
    "although users ranked our results in the same ballpark as _ companion _ , it is our contention that our algorithms are much less resource intensive and much more suited to inclusion in a real - world search engine .",
    "we maintain a deck of subnetworks , one corresponding to each significant keyword .",
    "it is difficult to estimate the number of significant keywords but if we take the widely used lexical database wordnet  @xcite as an indicator , the number is of the order of 100,000 .",
    "the _ companion _ algorithm , on the other hand , creates a subnetwork for each queried page .",
    "creating the subnetwork at query time is difficult because of the overhead involved in crawling the web ( or even an image of the web stored on disk ) and preprocessing and storing these networks appears infeasible given that the size of the world wide web is estimated to be in the tens of billions of pages  @xcite .",
    "even if it were feasible to store structural information on such a scale , the problem of updation is hard to solve .",
    "the web is constantly changing , and updating our keyword - based subnetworks will be an order of magnitude less resource intensive than updating billions of page - specific subnetworks .",
    "our approach is further vindicated by the observation that the results provided by _",
    "factrel _ and _ seekrel _ clearly outperform google s similar pages .",
    "we have tried to gracefully bring together textual and link information in a common framework where one can compensate for the shortcomings of the other .",
    "the guess jeans example presented above demonstrates that our scores can leverage link information to handle ambiguous keywords in a manner better than google can .",
    "the main contribution of this paper , in our view , is the location of our thinking on how to relate pages in the context of user intent . as part of our future research agenda",

    "<S> we argue that relationships between web pages are functions of the user s intent . </S>",
    "<S> we identify a class of web tasks - information - gathering - that can be facilitated by a search engine that provides links to pages which are related to the page the user is currently viewing . </S>",
    "<S> we define three kinds of intentional relationships that correspond to whether the user is a ) seeking sources of information , b ) reading pages which provide information , or c ) surfing through pages as part of an extended information - gathering process . </S>",
    "<S> we show that these three relationships can be productively mined using a combination of textual and link information and provide three scoring mechanisms that correspond to them : _ seekrel _ , _ factrel _ and _ surfrel_. these scoring mechanisms incorporate both textual and link information . </S>",
    "<S> we build a set of capacitated subnetworks - each corresponding to a particular keyword - that mirror the interconnection structure of the world wide web . </S>",
    "<S> the scores are computed by computing flows on these subnetworks . </S>",
    "<S> the capacities of the links are derived from the _ hub _ and _ authority _ values of the nodes they connect , following the work of kleinberg ( 1998 ) on assigning authority to pages in hyperlinked environments . </S>",
    "<S> we evaluated our scoring mechanism by running experiments on four data sets taken from the web . </S>",
    "<S> we present user evaluations of the relevance of the top results returned by our scoring mechanisms and compare those to the top results returned by google s similar pages feature , and the _ companion _ algorithm proposed by dean and henzinger ( 1999 ) . </S>"
