    "<S> using hybrid density functional theory combined with a semiempirical van der waals dispersion correction , we have investigated the structural and electronic properties of vacancies and self - interstitials in defective few - layer phosphorene . </S>",
    "<S> we find that both a vacancy and a self - interstitial defect are more stable in the outer layer than in the inner layer . the formation energy and transition energy of both a vacancy and a self - interstitial p defect decrease with increasing film thickness , mainly due to the upward shift of the host valence band maximum in reference to the vacuum level . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , both vacancies and self - interstitials could act as shallow acceptors , and this well explains the experimentally observed _ </S>",
