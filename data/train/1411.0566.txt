    "the fact that gauge coupling unification is a `` near - miss '' within the standard model ( sm ) provides an indication in favor of the idea of unification  @xcite .",
    "likewise , the existence of neutrino masses , required to account for neutrino oscillation data  @xcite , also provides another motivation towards unified or gut  ( grand unified theory)-like extensions of the sm .",
    "however , the most characteristic feature of gut - type unification , namely matter instability , has so far defied experimental confirmation  @xcite . on the other hand , neither the generation of neutrino masses nor the tilting in the evolution of the gauge couplings require unification in the conventional sense .",
    "for instance , it is well known that the gauge couplings merge in the minimal supersymmetric extension the sm , provided that supersymmetric states lie around the tev scale  @xcite .",
    "so far , though , there has been no trace of such states in the lhc data  @xcite .",
    "here we consider an alternative approach in which new physics at the tev scale realizes an extended electroweak gauge structure with perturbatively conserved baryon - number . for definiteness",
    "we consider the  @xcite ( 3 - 3 - 1 ) framework , which implies that the number of generations equals the number of colors , in order to cancel anomalies .",
    "this scheme has attracted attention recently also in connection with b physics  @xcite , or flavor symmetries  @xcite . in this letter",
    "we present a model in which the gauge couplings can naturally unify at some accessible energy , and where small calculable neutrino masses are induced by new gauge bosons exchange , in the absence of supersymmetry .",
    "neutrino masses arise at the tev scale  @xcite instead of the conventional high - scale seesaw mechanism  @xcite .",
    "we first recall that , by adding three gauge singlet fermions @xmath0 , the light neutrinos acquire mass only at one - loop order  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , however , unification does not occur , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : unificationplots0 ] .",
    "this is mostly due to fact that the new gauge bosons make @xmath1 weaker at high energies , while the new colored particles strengthen @xmath2 .",
    "hence we contemplate the possibility of unifying the gauge couplings in such a scheme   by promoting the three fermion singlets to three octets of the enlarged electroweak symmetry .",
    "the new variant not only opens the possibility of reconciling neutrino mass generation with gauge coupling unification but also provides a novel radiative seesaw mechanism .",
    "the   gauge group is broken down to the standard   model at some scale @xmath3 characterizing the new gauge boson masses .",
    "this scale is found to lie in the @xmath4 range , with a plethora of new states expected to be directly accessible to lhc searches .",

    "we consider a simple variant of the model introduced in  @xcite , where the fermion singlet is now promoted to an octet representation of @xmath6 . the model is based on the same   gauge symmetry , extended with a global @xmath7 , which is necessary in order to consistently define lepton number , and an auxiliary parity symmetry whose purpose will be made clear below .",

    "we summarize the particle content of the model in  table  [ tab : field_content ] . the allowed lepton interactions compatible with the quantum number assignments given in  table  [ tab : field_content ] are the following : @xmath8    the components of @xmath9 and the @xmath10 are written as : @xmath11 the scalars take vacuum expectation values ( _ vevs _ ) in the directions @xmath12 and @xmath13 . as for the octets ,",
    "one can write @xmath14 such that @xmath15 is transformed into @xmath16 under an @xmath17 gauge transformation , where @xmath18 is the transformation matrix of the triplet representation .",
    "+ under , each @xmath15 breaks into the representations @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , so there are four new charged leptons ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) and four new neutral fermion states ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath25 ) in each generation .",

    "the exotic scalar states are also integrated out at the 1 tev scale , although the running of the gauge couplings is not very sensitive to this value .",
    "given that the @xmath59 coefficients are not very different from @xmath60 with the three octets , unification is sensitive mostly to the ratio @xmath50 , and not to the 3 - 3 - 1 scale _ per se_. the effect is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : unificationplot_zoomed ] ; allowing for threshold and 2-loop effects , one can see that unification constrains @xmath61 to lie between 1 and 6 .",

    "in contrast , the _ vevs _ @xmath70 and @xmath71 must lie at the electroweak scale since they belong to @xmath72 doublets after the breaking of @xmath6 .",

    "the admixture of the remaining neutrino states are suppressed by at least a factor @xmath80 , which can be vanishingly small .",
    "we have verified that in the multi - generation case @xmath82 has a null eigenvector associated to each of the three generations of leptons . as a result neutrinos are massless in the tree level approximation . this property forms the basis of the radiative mechanism discussed below .",
