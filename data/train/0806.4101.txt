    "understanding the evolution of star formation in the universe is a fundamental objective of observational cosmology .",
    "various efforts using data from ultraviolet through radio wavelengths have shown that the star formation rate ( sfr ) per unit volume of the universe increases rapidly with redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "it is not yet well established , however , why this evolution occurs , at what redshift is the maximum , and whether the evolution in the star formation rate is primarily luminosity evolution ( more star formation per galaxy at high redshift ) or density evolution ( more star - forming galaxies at high redshift ) .",
    "various observations with the spitzer space telescope ( @xmath1 ) are providing new insights into this problem , because the signatures of luminous , rapid star formation ( starbursts ) are easily seen in the spectra obtained with the the infrared spectrograph on @xmath1 ( irs ; houck et al .",
    "these features are the strong emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pah ) which dominate the spectra of starbursts in the mid - infrared spectral region from @xmath10 5@xmath4 m  to @xmath10 20@xmath4 m  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "these features are remarkably similar in starbursts ranging from low - luminosity , nearby galaxies @xcite to ultraluminous galaxies at z @xmath10 2 @xcite .    because extinction corrections are much less significant in the mid - infrared compared to optical or ultraviolet , the pah luminosities are more confident indicators of intrinsic starburst luminosity than optical or ultraviolet emission .",
    "in addition , the broad wavelength range over which the same features can be consistently observed with the irs makes it possible to trace pah luminosity for 0 @xmath0 z @xmath11 3 using the strong pah features at 6.2@xmath4 m  and 7.7@xmath4 m  .",
    "observing these features in a wide variety of sources provides a unique tracer of star formation over most of the history of the universe .    in the present paper",

    "although we utilize pah features as the starburst indicator , the selection criteria for the samples did not incorporate selection effects which arise from the strength or nature of the pah features .",

    "the dominance of the 7.7@xmath4 m feature in spectra of faint , high redshift sources is illustrated in average spectra for such sources in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the mixing of the 7.7@xmath4 m feature with the adjacent 8.6@xmath4 m feature and the difficulty of defining the underlying continuum , especially for sources with silicate absorption centered at 9.7@xmath4 m , makes the measurement of total flux in the 7.7@xmath4 m feature very uncertain .",
    "the difficulties of measuring total fluxes of the pah features are discussed , for example , by @xcite who emphasize that different measurement tools give different answers , depending primarily on the breadth and fitting techniques assumed for the wings of pah features .",

    "@xcite showed that the empirical calibration of @xmath2l@xmath3 ( 7.7@xmath4 m ) to sfr using the pure starburst sample of @xcite leads to a measure of the integrated sfr in the local universe that is consistent with that measured for starburst galaxies using independent techniques .",
    "@xcite conclude , therefore , that this parameter can be used with confidence to determine the sfr within luminous starburst galaxies , although @xmath2l@xmath3 ( 7.7@xmath4 m ) overestimates the starburst luminosity if there is an agn contribution to the underlying continuum .    the luminosities @xmath2l@xmath3 ( 7.7@xmath4 m ) for the sample of 243 galaxies are given in table 1 .",
    "except for ulirgs chosen from bright iras sources , the galaxies are included only if the references classify the sources as starbursts , based on the equivalent widths of the pah features or on fitting the spectrum with a pure starburst template .",
    "for these `` pure starbursts '' , we have measured f@xmath3 ( 7.7@xmath4 m ) from published spectra or from new extractions of unpublished archival data , and these measured values are included in table 1 . for ulirgs , discussed further below in section 2.3 , the @xmath2l@xmath3 ( 7.7@xmath4 m ) are scaled to published luminosities for other pah features because there may be a significant contribution to the @xmath2l@xmath3 ( 7.7@xmath4 m ) from an underlying agn continuum .",

    "all luminosities are shown compared to redshift in figure 3 .",
    "the only sources included in this summary which sometime have spectroscopic indicators of an agn contribution are the iras ulirgs , which often show the deep silicate absorption characteristic of agn while also showing pah features ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "for such composite sources , simply taking @xmath2l@xmath3 ( 7.7@xmath4 m ) would not be an appropriate measure of starburst luminosity because @xmath2l@xmath3 ( 7.7@xmath4 m ) can be enhanced by an underlying agn continuum .",
    "these ulirgs are sufficiently bright to have s / n adequate for measurement of total fluxes in the weaker pah features at 6.2@xmath4 m and/or 11.3@xmath4 m .",
    "these two pah features are sufficiently isolated in the spectrum that they can be measured as single gaussians on top of an underlying continuum , so that a total flux can be determined much more precisely than for the 7.7@xmath4 m feature .",
    "the blending of pah features makes especially difficult the definition of total flux in the 7.7@xmath4 m feature , as discussed , for example , by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "furthermore , sources with deep 9.7@xmath4 m silicate absorption have a continuum peak near 8@xmath4 m which further complicates isolation of the 7.7@xmath4 m feature .",
    "this peak is seen in the spectrum of markarian 231 , shown in figure 1 .",
    "the effects of starburst and agn composite spectra are illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "rest - frame spectra are shown only between 5@xmath4 m and 14@xmath4 m because this is the spectral region with diagnostics that differentiate starbursts and agn .",
    "also , these rest - frame wavelengths are all that can be observed with the irs in sources with z @xmath14 1.5 , which are the high redshifts of particular importance to our analysis .",
    "the agn markarian 231 has an absorption spectrum and luminosity that is typical of absorbed ulirgs @xcite , so this ulirg provides an excellent representative example for an agn contribution to the mid - infrared spectrum . for a starburst comparison to markarian 231 , we use the irs spectrum from @xcite of the prototype starburst ngc 7714 .",
    "figure 1 illustrates composite spectra that arise from different mixtures of the markarian 231 and ngc 7714 spectra , from pure starburst at the top through starburst contributions of 75% , 50% , and 25% to pure agn at the bottom .",
    "spectra are normalized to the peak which is between 7.7@xmath4 m and 7.9@xmath4 m , depending on the composite .",
    "the decreasing equivalent width of the pah features is evident as the starburst contribution lessens .",
    "this is shown quantitatively in figure 2 , which tracks the equivalent width ( ew ) in the rest frame of the 6.2@xmath4 m feature as a function of the starburst contribution .",
    "this ew is measured by fitting a single gaussian profile to the 6.2@xmath4 m feature and using the underlying `` continuum '' defined between 5.5@xmath4 m and 6.9@xmath4 m . for pure starbursts , much of this `` continuum '' may actually be extended wings of the 7.7@xmath4 m pah complex , but measuring the 6.2@xmath4 m feature in this way provides a consistent measurement of its strength .",
    "the `` pure starbursts '' in our sample generally have rest frame equivalent widths for the 6.2@xmath4 m feature greater than 0.5@xmath4 m , indicating that the starburst contribution exceeds 90% of the mid - infrared luminosity . however , equivalent widths for the ulirgs are generally less than this value , implying an agn contribution to the underlying continuum . for the ulirgs , a simple measure of @xmath2l@xmath3 ( 7.7@xmath4 m ) could overestimate the starburst luminosity .",
    "for this reason , we determine a @xmath2l@xmath3 ( 7.7@xmath4 m ) for the starburst component of ulirgs by using the published luminosities of the total pah features l(6.2@xmath4 m ) @xcite or l(6.2@xmath4m+11.3@xmath4 m ) @xcite .",
    "such luminosities are measured only for the pah emission feature and do not include any continuum contribution from the agn .",
    "luminosities of these features are related to the luminosity of our pah parameter @xmath2l@xmath3(7.7@xmath4 m  ) using empirical transformations which have been determined by measuring @xmath2f@xmath3 ( 7.7@xmath4 m ) , f(6.2@xmath4 m ) , and f(11.3@xmath4 m ) for the brightest 69 pure starbursts in table 1 ( sargsyan et al .",

    "because the redshift intervals are not evenly sampled , we have quantitatively fit this envelope to avoid the sampling differences by choosing the most luminous sources in each interval of 0.02 in log(1+z ) .",
    "there are 27 such intervals in the redshift range plotted , and all intervals have sources within the interval except for 4 intervals ( 0.3 to 0.32 , 0.32 to 0.34 , 0.36 to 0.38 , and 0.52 to 0.54 ) .",
    "the linear ( first order ) least squares fit to these most luminous sources is given by @xmath16 = 44.63($\\pm$0.09 ) + 2.48($\\pm$0.28 ) log(1+z)$$\\ ] ] the solid line illustrated in figure 3 illustrates this fit for maximum starburst luminosity for 0 @xmath0 z @xmath0 2.55 .",
    "the luminosities @xmath2l@xmath3(7.7@xmath4 m  ) in table 1 and figure 3 contain no extinction corrections .",
    "for pure starbursts , these corrections would be small .",
    "the sample in @xcite has an average optical depth at the 9.7@xmath4 m  silicate absorption feature of 0.24 . using the extinction curve of @xcite and assuming this silicate absorption also applies to the pah features",
    ", the extinction at the 7.7@xmath4 m  feature would be only 0.05 mag .",
    "sources in our sample which would be most vulnerable to uncertain extinction corrections are the iras ulirgs , because their spectra often shown clear evidence of substantial silicate absorption by silicate dust ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the starburst luminosities of iras ulirgs are shown with different symbols ( triangles ) in figure 3 and are discussed more below .    while extinction corrections might affect the results for @xmath2l@xmath3(7.7@xmath4 m  ) for some sources in figure 3",
    ", this would not affect our primary conclusions .",
    "this is because our most important use of the pah luminosities is in section 3.3 , where they are transformed to bolometric luminosities ( @xmath6 ) and star formation rates ( sfr ) .",
    "this transformation is empirical , so extinction corrections are not relevant for determining @xmath6 and sfr as long as the systematic corrections are the same in the sources used to determine the empirical transformations as in the sources to which the transformations are applied .      of the 243 sources in table 1 , 83 ( 34% ) are included because they had been selected as ulirgs . to allow identification of these iras ulirgs , figures 3 and 4 use different symbols ( triangles ) to show the luminosities of the starburst component in the iras ulirg samples compared to the pure starbursts from other samples .",
    "( the iras fsc sources from @xcite are also shown with ulirg symbols although they were not included because of initial selection as ulirgs . )    for z @xmath0 0.2 where most ulirgs are found , the starbursts of maximum luminosity are primarily in ulirgs , although the most luminous ulirg starbursts are no more luminous than the most luminous pure starbursts . for sources over all redshifts shown in figure 4 , the median luminosities of ulirg starbursts and pure starbursts are very similar .",
    "these results indicate that the starbursts in absorbed ulirgs are not systematically different from starbursts in other sources .",
    "many previous studies of ulirgs show that these sources often contain some luminosity from an agn @xcite and that many have buried luminosity sources which are extremely obscured ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with sufficient obscuration",
    ", no direct spectroscopic indicators can emerge from the obscuring dust to determine if the obscured source shows the characteristic pah features of starbursts or the high ionization lines of agn .",
    "@xcite argue from radiative transfer considerations that the buried sources are most probably agn which heat their immediate surroundings to a high dust temperature , and this hot continuum is progressively absorbed by cooler surrounding dust .",
    "such a scenario leads to a consistent description of those ulirgs showing both strong silicate absorption and pah features .",
    "this description is that the buried agn is the obscured source and that the pah features arise from much less obscured starbursts occuring within the clouds surrounding the agn . in this case",
    ", the extinction to the starburst would be much less than the extinction derived from the optical depth of the silicate feature .",
    "there is qualitative evidence supporting this description .",
    "this evidence is the similarity in the ratio of the 11.3@xmath4 m  to 6.2@xmath4 m  pah fluxes in composite spectra of heavily absorbed ulirgs compared to this ratio in pure starbursts .",
    "this result can be seen in figure 1 of @xcite which compares the average starburst spectrum from @xcite to the average spectrum of heavily absorbed ulirgs .",
    "the 11.3@xmath4 m  to 6.2@xmath4 m  ratio is approximately 1.0 in both cases , even though the 11.3@xmath4 m  feature is within the 9.7@xmath4 m  silicate absorption so should be suppressed if it is obscured by the same silicate absorption that obscures the buried source .",
    "the average absorbed ulirg shown in @xcite has a 9.7@xmath4 m  silicate optical depth of 1.5 .",
    "for this absorption , the 11.3@xmath4 m  feature is extincted by 1.1 mag compared to 0.48 mag of extinction for the 6.2@xmath4 m  feature , using the extinction curve of @xcite .",
    "this differential extinction would imply that the observed 11.3@xmath4 m  to 6.2@xmath4 m  ratio would be 0.56 for an intrinsic ratio of 1.0 . that such a lower ratio is not observed in the absorbed ulirgs",
    "is evidence that their starbursts are not extincted by the same dust that produces the silicate absorption .",
    "this reasoning justifies treating ulirg starbursts the same as other starbursts regarding extinction corrections .",
    "therefore , we do not apply extinction corrections to the ulirgs and will apply the same transformation between pah luminosities and @xmath6 to the ulirg starbursts as to the other starbursts .",
    "the plotted values and fitted envelope in figure 3 derive strictly from observed data , with no assumptions regarding templates or spectral shapes for starburst galaxies .",
    "the only assumption is that the values of @xmath2l@xmath3 ( 7.7@xmath4 m ) arise purely from a starburst , with no contribution from an agn . as discussed above ,",
    "the sample was chosen in order to use only pure starbursts with no evidence that the pah complex is diluted by an agn , or to use sources with published luminosities of individual pah features for the starburst component when there is evidence of an agn .",
    "the @xmath2l@xmath3 ( 7.7@xmath4 m ) in figure 3 can be transformed to bolometric luminosities ( @xmath6 ) and star formation rates ( sfr ) using empirically determined conversions .",
    "such conversions and their relevant uncertainties are subject to further refinement , but this would not affect the data shown in figure 3 . for further discussion ,",

    "@xcite showed that the conversions in equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , which are derived empirically from the sample of 22 starburst galaxies in @xcite , lead to results for the local sfr density that are consistent with independent results from all sky samples of iras which determine @xmath6 using measured continuum luminosities from iras .",

    "the transformation from near - infrared to bolometric luminosities depends on whether a source is an agn or a starburst and what mix of spectra applies to the ensemble of sources .",
    "@xcite and @xcite derive transformations based on observed fluxes at 8@xmath4 m , 24@xmath4 m , 70@xmath4 m , and 160@xmath4 m taken with a mix of templates . at 8@xmath4 m ,",
    "the @xcite result is log @xmath6 = 1.06 log[@xmath2l@xmath3 ( 8@xmath4 m ) ] + 0.28 , for @xmath2l@xmath3 ( 8@xmath4 m ) in l@xmath8 .",
    "the @xcite result is log @xmath6 = 0.83 log[@xmath2l@xmath3 ( 8@xmath4 m ) ] + 2.57 , also using l@xmath8 .",
    "we can compare these transformations to those we use based on @xmath2l@xmath3(7.7@xmath4 m ) at the peak of the pah feature .",
    "because of slightly different luminosity dependencies among the transformations in @xcite and @xcite , we use for comparisons a representative luminosity for the most luminous starbursts of log[@xmath2l@xmath3 ( 7.7@xmath4 m ) ] = 45.5 , in ergs s@xmath7 , or 11.9 in l@xmath8 . at this luminosity",
    ", our transformation gives log @xmath6 = 46.3 in ergs s@xmath7 , or log @xmath6 = 12.7 in l@xmath8 .",
    "taking the @xmath2l@xmath3 ( 8@xmath4 m ) , @xcite would derive log @xmath6 = 12.9 , and @xcite would derive 12.4 .",
    "these results bracket our result based on the empirical transformation for pure starbursts , so this is independent evidence that within the uncertainties of the various estimates , our transformation is valid .",
    "this consistency also indicates that the @xcite and @xcite transformations apply primarily for starbursts rather than for agn .",
    "the weak dependence on luminosity in the @xcite and @xcite results is also evidence that justifies our application of a luminosity - independent transformation .",
    "the transformation from a pah luminosity to a sfr depends on relating the sfr to the bolometric luminosity , @xmath6 , after adopting a relation between pah luminosity and @xmath6 .",
    "such transformations are most commonly based on the relations in @xcite which determine the bolometric luminosity from a star - forming galaxy as a function of the total sfr .",
    "the bolometric luminosity can be related to various other measured parameters , such as ultraviolet luminosity from the ionizing stars or emission line luminosities .",
    "results can be refined for different initial mass functions , starburst ages and estimates of extinction .",
    "for example , the sfr can be determined from the luminosity of the [ ne ii ] and [ ne iii ] lines @xcite . by empirically comparing luminosities of the neon lines with those of pah features ,",
    "@xcite relate the sfr as given by @xcite to the luminosities of the 6.2@xmath4 m plus 11.3@xmath4 m pah features in a starburst .",
    "the result in @xcite is log(sfr ) = log[l(6.2@xmath4 m + 11.3@xmath4 m ) ] - 40.9 .",
    "if we use our transformation discussed in section 2.3 , @xmath2l@xmath3(7.7@xmath4 m  ) = 28(@xmath56 ) l(6.2@xmath4m+11.3@xmath4 m ) , our equation ( 3 ) becomes log(sfr ) = log[l(6.2@xmath4 m + 11.3@xmath4 m ) ] - 41.1 . to within the uncertainties , this is the same result as derived by @xcite from the neon lines .",
    "for now , therefore , we consider the relations in equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) for determining bolometric luminosity and sfr to be as accurate as other methods currently available , although we certainly expect refinements in the future . using these transformations along with equation ( 1 ) for the change of @xmath2l@xmath3(7.7@xmath4 m  ) with redshift as shown in figure 3 , we then have that@xmath19for @xmath6 in ergs s@xmath7 , and@xmath20 for sfr in m@xmath8 yr@xmath7 .",
    "the most luminous starburst in the sample is mips 506 @xcite , no .",
    "192 in table 1 , with log[@xmath2l@xmath3 ( 7.7@xmath4 m ) ] = 46.10 , which gives a sfr = 3.4 x 10@xmath9 m@xmath8 yr@xmath7 .",
    "we emphasize again that these results are based strictly on the measurement of pah luminosity in starburst sources .",
    "it is useful , therefore , to compare with previous results for maximum sfr derived from completely independent selection and measurement criteria .",
    "the most luminous starburst galaxies previously reported are those in the submillimeter galaxy population .",
    "while this population contains both agn and starbursts , sources with cooler dust are attributed primarily to starbursts . the upper envelope for log(@xmath6 ) for submm - discovered starbursts",
    "is @xmath10 46.5 at z @xmath10 2 @xcite .",
    "this result is very similar to the maximum luminosity of 46.6 which we would find for starbursts at z = 2 from equation ( 4 ) .",
    "this comparison indicates , therefore , that the use of pah features for seeking luminous starbursts does indeed find sources that are as luminous in bolometric luminosity as those known from other techniques .",
    "the evolution of star formation in the universe is fundamentally described by determining the change of the total luminosity density of the universe as a function of redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". this can be described by various combinations of pure luminosity evolution and pure density evolution for star - forming galaxies .",
    "pure luminosity evolution means that the shape of the luminosity function for star - forming galaxies does not change ; the number of galaxies per comoving volume remains the same and only their luminosities change .",
    "all galaxies at a given space density in the luminosity function simply scale up in luminosity by the same factor with increasing redshift .    for pure luminosity evolution ,",
    "the evolution of the entire luminosity function is the same as the evolution of the most luminous starbursts . with such evolution ,",
    "results determined above in section 3.1 which describe the scaling of luminosity with redshift would apply to all star - forming galaxies .",
    "we can not conclude that such evolution applies to lower luminosity star formation , however , because our data are not sufficient to determine the shape of the luminosity function at different redshifts .",
    "the thorough study of @xcite using photometric redshifts of @xmath1-detected sources and template fitting to determine source luminosities indicates a factor of ( 1+z)@xmath21 for evolution of the total luminosity density to z @xmath10 1 .",
    "@xcite separate this into a factor of ( 1+z)@xmath22 for luminosity evolution and ( 1+z)@xmath23 for density evolution .",
    "this small factor for density evolution is evidence that the number density of star forming galaxies changes little ; evolution is primarily in the luminosity per galaxy .",
    "these results for total evolution also agree within the uncertainties with earlier estimates based on infrared @xcite and submillimeter @xcite source counts and redshifts .",
    "the comprehensive summary by @xcite of evolution parameters derived from optical and radio constraints gives smaller values , with evolution going as ( 1+z)@xmath24 and being almost entirely luminosity evolution .",
    "hopkins states that the preferred exponent for luminosity evolution is 2.7 @xmath50.6 .",
    "this form of evolution continues to z @xmath10 2.5 but may flatten beyond that redshift .",
    "because of the uncertainty in the exponent for the ( 1+z ) factor , the difference in the luminosity evolution exponent between optical / radio results and infrared / submillimeter results may not be significant .",
    "we can compare the previously determined evolution parameters with those we determine from the most luminous sources .",
    "for our results , the envelope describing maximum starburst luminosity to z = 2.5 shown in figures 3 and 4 has the maximum luminosity of starbursts evolving as ( 1+z)@xmath25 . for lower redshifts , to z = 1 , another envelope is shown with the @xcite factor for luminosity evolution of ( 1+z)@xmath22 . although the uncertainties in the exponents indicate that our evolution factor and the @xcite factor are similar within uncertainties , the steeper evolution does not track well the lower redshift starbursts in figures 3 and 4 and would certainly overestimate luminosities at higher redshifts .",
    "our results for the summary of starbursts in figure 3 indicate , therefore , that luminosity evolution for the most luminous starbursts scales more closely to the lower value of @xcite .",
    "figure 3 is also a clear demonstration that this luminosity evolution continues at least to z = 2.5 .",
    "a possible explanation for the differences found for evolution of pure starbursts compared to the evolution derived from modeling total infrared source counts and redshift distributions , such as in @xcite , is that infrared sources include a significant fraction of agn , and the evolution of agn may differ from that of starbursts .",
    "a sample of 243 starburst galaxies with infrared spectra obtained by the infrared spectrograph on @xmath1 has been assembled with measurements of pah luminosities to determine the most luminous starbursts discovered .",
    "the sample includes sources from a variety of @xmath1 observing programs and covers 0 @xmath0 z @xmath0 2.5 ( figure 3 ) .",
    "starburst luminosities are derived from the luminosity @xmath2l@xmath3 ( 7.7@xmath4 m ) as determined from the peak flux density of the 7.7@xmath4 m pah feature .",
    "these luminosities for the most luminous starbursts scale with redshift as log[@xmath2l@xmath3 ( 7.7@xmath4 m ) ] = 44.63(@xmath50.09 ) + 2.48(@xmath50.28 ) log(1+z ) .",
    "this result demonstrates that pure luminosity evolution for starbursts scales approximately with ( 1+z)@xmath25 , at least to z = 2.5 .",
    "this is less evolution than determined from previous infrared - derived source counts but agrees with the evolution determined from optical and radio samples of star - forming galaxies .",
    "transformations of @xmath2l@xmath3 ( 7.7@xmath4 m ) to bolometric luminosities @xmath6 and to star formation rates are determined empirically from local starbursts and are shown to be the same as such transformations derived by others using a variety of star formation indicators and a variety of sources . using the conversions that log @xmath6 = log[@xmath2l@xmath3 ( 7.7@xmath4 m ) ] + 0.78 , and that log[sfr ] = log[@xmath2l@xmath3 ( 7.7@xmath4 m ) ] - 42.57",
    ", for luminosities in ergs s@xmath7 and sfr in m@xmath8 yr@xmath7 , we find that :        the most luminous starbursts in the sample are similar in sfr to the most luminous starbursts previously found in submillimeter surveys ; the maximum starburst in the sample has sfr = 3.4 x 10@xmath9 m@xmath8 yr@xmath7 .",
    "we also find that at the redshifts of iras ulirgs , z @xmath0 0.2 , the most luminous ulirg starbursts are similar in luminosity to the most luminous pure starbursts .",
    "these results indicate that the starburst component in composite , heavily absorbed ulirgs having both a starburst and agn component is not systematically different from the pure starbursts in other sources .",
