    "the argument invariably says that if a desired property does not hold , then the object can be compressed .",
    "this yields the required contradiction . since a randomly generated object is _ with overwhelming probability",
    "_ individually random and hence incompressible , one usually obtains the property with high probability .",

    "we show that : for every labeled graph on @xmath0 nodes with high kolmogorov complexity ( also called `` kolmogorov random graph '' or `` high complexity graph '' ) the node degree of every vertex is about @xmath1 and there are about @xmath2 node - disjoint paths of length 2 between every pair of nodes . in section  [ sect.statsubgr ] , we analyze ` normality ' properties of kolmogorov random graphs . in analogy with infinite sequences",
    "one can call an infinite labeled graph ` normal ' if each finite ordered labeled subgraph of size @xmath3 occurs in the appropriate sense ( possibly overlapping ) with limiting frequency @xmath4 .",
    "it follows from martin - lf s theory of effective tests for randomness @xcite that individually random ( high complexity ) infinite labeled graphs are normal .",
    "such properties can not hold precisely for finite graphs , where randomness is necessarily a matter of degree : we determine close quantitative bounds on the normality ( frequency of subgraphs ) of high complexity finite graphs in terms of their randomness deficiency .",
    "denote the number of unlabeled graphs on @xmath0 nodes by @xmath5 . in section",
    "[ sect.unlabeled ] we demonstrate the use of the incompressibility method and kolmogorov random graphs by providing a new elementary proof that @xmath6 .",
    "this has previously been obtained by more advanced methods , @xcite .",
    "moreover , we give a good estimate of the error term .",
    "part of the proof involves estimating the order ( number of automorphisms ) @xmath7 of graphs @xmath8 as a function of the randomness deficiency of @xmath8 .",
    "for example , we show that labeled graphs with randomness deficiency appropriately less than @xmath0 are rigid ( have but one automorphism : the identity automorphism ) .    * related work * several properties above ( high degree nodes , diameter 2 , rigidity ) have also been proven by traditional methods to hold with high probability for randomly generated graphs , @xcite .",
    "we provide new proofs for these results using the incompressibility method .",
    "they are actually proved to hold for the definite class of kolmogorov random graphs  rather than with high probability for randomly generated graphs .",
    "in @xcite ( also @xcite ) two of us investigated topological properties of labeled graphs with high kolmogorov complexity and proved them using the incompressibility method to compare ease of such proofs with the probabilistic method @xcite and entropy method .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that every labeled tree on @xmath0 nodes with randomness deficiency @xmath9 has maximum node degree of @xmath10 .",

    "infinite binary sequences that asymptotically have equal numbers of 0 s and 1 s , and more generally , where every block of length @xmath3 occurs ( possibly overlapping ) with frequency @xmath11 were called `` normal '' by e. borel , @xcite . references @xcite investigate the quantitative deviation from normal as a function of the kolmogorov complexity of a finite binary string . here",
    "we consider analogous question for kolmogorov random graphs .",
    "finally , there is a close relation and genuine differences between high - probability properties and properties of incompressible objects , see @xcite , section 6.2 .",
    "we use the following notation .",
    "let @xmath12 be a finite set .",
    "by @xmath13 we denote the _ cardinality _ of @xmath12 . in particular ,",
    "let @xmath15 be a finite binary string .",
    "then @xmath16 denotes the _ length _",
    "( number of bits ) of @xmath15 .",
    "in particular , @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the _",
    "empty word_.    let @xmath19 , where @xmath20 denotes the natural numbers .",
    "identify @xmath20 and @xmath21 according to the correspondence @xmath22 hence , the length @xmath16 of @xmath15 is the number of bits in the binary string or number @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath23 be a standard enumeration of all turing machines .",
    "let @xmath24 be a standard one - one mapping from @xmath25 to @xmath20 , for technical reasons choosen such that @xmath26 .",
    "an example is @xmath27 .",
    "this can be iterated to @xmath28 .    informally , the kolmogorov complexity , @xcite , of @xmath15 is the length of the _ shortest _ effective description of @xmath15 .",
    "that is , the _ kolmogorov complexity _",
    "@xmath29 of a finite string @xmath15 is simply the length of the shortest program , say in fortran ( or in turing machine codes ) encoded in binary , which prints @xmath15 without any input .",
    "a similar definition holds conditionally , in the sense that @xmath30 is the length of the shortest binary program which computes @xmath15 on input @xmath31 .",
    "kolmogorov complexity is absolute in the sense of being independent of the programming language , up to a fixed additional constant term which depends on the programming language but not on @xmath15 .",
    "we now fix one canonical programming language once and for all as reference and thereby @xmath32 . for the theory and applications , see @xcite .",
    "a formal definition is as follows :    let @xmath33 be an appropriate universal turing machine such that @xmath34 for all @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the _ conditional kolmogorov complexity _ of @xmath15 given @xmath31 is @xmath37 the unconditional kolmogorov complexity of @xmath15 is defined as @xmath38 .",
    "it is easy to see that there are strings that can be described by programs much shorter than themselves .",
    "for instance , the function defined by @xmath39 and @xmath40 for @xmath41 grows very fast , @xmath42 is a `` stack '' of @xmath3 twos . yet for each @xmath3 it is clear that @xmath42 has complexity at most @xmath43 .",
    "what about incompressibility ?    by a simple counting argument one can show that whereas some strings can be enormously compressed , the majority of strings can hardly be compressed at all .",
    "for each @xmath0 there are @xmath44 binary strings of length @xmath0 , but only @xmath45 possible shorter descriptions .",
    "therefore , there is at least one binary string @xmath15 of length @xmath0 such that @xmath46 .",
    "we call such strings @xmath47",
    ". it also follows that for any length @xmath0 and any binary string @xmath31 , there is a binary string @xmath15 of length @xmath0 such that @xmath48 .",
    "generally , for every constant @xmath49 we can call a string @xmath15 is _ c - incompressible if @xmath50 .",
    "strings that are incompressible ( say , @xmath49-incompressible with small @xmath49 ) are patternless , since a pattern could be used to reduce the description length . intuitively , we think of such patternless sequences as being random , and we use `` random sequence '' synonymously with `` incompressible sequence . '' by the same counting argument as before we find that the number of strings of length @xmath0 that are @xmath49-incompressible is at least @xmath51 .",
    "hence there is at least one 0-incompressible string of length @xmath0 , at least one - half of all strings of length @xmath0 are 1-incompressible , at least three - fourths of all strings of length @xmath0 are 2-incompressible ,  , and at least the @xmath52th part of all @xmath44 strings of length @xmath0 are @xmath49-incompressible .",
    "this means that for each constant @xmath53 the majority of all strings of length @xmath0 ( with @xmath54 ) is @xmath49-incompressible .",
    "we generalize this to the following simple but extremely useful : _    [ c2 ] let @xmath49 be a positive integer",
    ". for each fixed @xmath31 , every set @xmath12 of cardinality @xmath55 has at least @xmath56 elements @xmath15 with @xmath57 .    by simple counting .    as an example , set @xmath58 .",
    "then the cardinality of @xmath12 is @xmath59 . since it is easy to assert that @xmath60 for some fixed @xmath49 and all @xmath15 in @xmath12 , lemma  [ c2 ] demonstrates that this trivial estimate is quite sharp .",
    "the deeper reason is that since there are few short programs , there can be only few objects of low complexity .",
    "we require another quantity : the prefix kolmogorov complexity which is defined just as @xmath61 but now with respect to a subset of turing machines that have the property that the set of programs for which the machine halts is prefix - free , that is , no halting program is a prefix of any other halting program .",
    "for details see @xcite . here",
    "we require only the quantitative relation below .",
    "the _ prefix _ kolmogorov complexity of @xmath15 conditional to @xmath31 is denoted by @xmath62 .",
    "it satisfies the inequality @xmath63",
    "[ sect.topol ] statistical properties of strings with high kolmogorov complexity have been studied in @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of strings as more complex combinatorial objects leads to a new set of properties and problems that have no direct counterpart in the `` flatter '' string world .",
    "here we derive topological , combinatorial , and statistical properties of graphs with high kolmogorov complexity .",
    "every such graph possesses simultaneously all properties that hold with high probability for randomly generated graphs .",
    "they constitute `` almost all graphs '' and the derived properties a fortiori hold with probability that goes to 1 as the number of nodes grows unboundedly .",
    "[ def.gc ] each labeled graph @xmath64 on @xmath0 nodes @xmath65 can be represented ( up to automorphism ) by a binary string @xmath66 of length @xmath67 .",
    "we simply assume a fixed ordering of the @xmath67 possible edges in an @xmath0-node graph , e.g. lexicographically , and let the @xmath35th bit in the string indicate presence ( 1 ) or absence ( 0 ) of the @xmath35th edge .",
    "conversely , each binary string of length @xmath67 encodes an @xmath0-node graph .",
    "hence we can identify each such graph with its binary string representation .              labeled graphs with high - complexity have many specific topological properties , which seem to contradict their randomness .",
    "however , these are simply the likely properties , whose absence would be rather unlikely .",
    "thus , randomness enforces strict statistical regularities .",
    "for example , to have diameter exactly two .",
    "[ blockszerotex ] let @xmath77 be a binary string of length @xmath0 , and @xmath31 a much smaller string of length @xmath78 .",
    "let @xmath79 and @xmath80 be the number of ( possibly overlapping ) distinct occurrences of @xmath31 in @xmath15 . for convenience , we assume that @xmath15 `` wraps around '' so that an occurrence of @xmath31 starting at the end of @xmath15 and continuing at the start also counts .",
    "assume that @xmath81 .",
    "there is a constant @xmath49 such that for all @xmath0 and @xmath82 , if @xmath83 , then @xmath84 with @xmath85 3l / \\log e $ ] .",
    "the only graphs with diameter 1 are the complete graphs that can be described in @xmath89 bits , given @xmath0 , and hence are not random .",
    "it remains to consider an @xmath86-random graph @xmath64 with diameter greater than or equal to 2 .",
    "let @xmath88 be a pair of nodes connected by @xmath90 disjoint paths of length 2 .",
    "then we can describe @xmath8 by modifying the old code for @xmath8 as follows :    * a program to reconstruct the object from the various parts of the encoding in @xmath89 bits ; * the identities of @xmath91 in @xmath92 bits ; * the old code @xmath66 of @xmath8 with the @xmath93 bits representing presence or absence of edges @xmath94 and @xmath95 for each @xmath96 deleted . * a shortest program for the string @xmath97 consisting of the ( reordered ) @xmath98 pairs of bits deleted above .",
    "> from this description we can reconstruct @xmath8 in @xmath99 bits , from which we may conclude that @xmath100 . as shown in @xcite or @xcite (",
    "here lemma  [ blockszerotex ] ) this implies that the frequency of occurrence in @xmath97 of the aligned 2-bit block ` 11'which by construction equals the number of disjoint paths of length 2 between @xmath35 and @xmath101is @xmath102 .            with respect to the related property of random graphs , in @xcite pp .",
    "86,87 it is shown that a random graph with edge probability @xmath105 contains a clique on asymptotically @xmath106 nodes with probability at least @xmath107 .",
    "let @xmath64 be a labeled graph on @xmath0 nodes .",
    "consider a labeled graph @xmath108 on @xmath3 nodes @xmath109 .",

    "the subgraph @xmath110 is an ordered labeled _ occurrence _ of @xmath108 when we obtain @xmath108 by relabeling the nodes @xmath111 of @xmath110 as @xmath112 .",
    "it is easy to conclude from the statistics of high - complexity strings in lemma  [ blockszerotex ] that the frequency of each of the two labeled two - node subgraphs ( there are only two different ones : the graph consisting of two isolated nodes and the graph consisting of two connected nodes ) in a @xmath68-random graph @xmath8 is @xmath113 this case is easy since the frequency of such subgraphs corresponds to the frequency of 1 s or @xmath114 s in the @xmath67-length standard encoding @xmath66 of @xmath8 .",
    "however , to determine the frequencies of labeled subgraphs on @xmath3 nodes ( up to isomorphism ) for @xmath115 is a matter more complicated than the frequencies of substrings of length @xmath3 . clearly , there are @xmath116 subsets of @xmath3 nodes out of @xmath0 and hence that many occurrences of subgraphs .",
    "such subgraphs may overlap in more complex ways than substrings of a string .",

    "now consider an experiment of @xmath136 trials , each trial with the same set of @xmath137 outcomes .",
    "intuitively , each trial corresponds to an element of a cover , and each outcome corresponds to a @xmath3-node subgraph .",

    "one can do this for each @xmath35 independently , notwithstanding the dependence between the frequencies of subgraphs in different covers .",
