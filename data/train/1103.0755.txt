    "spiral galaxies are among the more massive galaxies in the universe , that in the @xmath9-cold dark matter paradigm are believed to have formed from the agglomeration of smaller building blocks .",
    "they have gaseous , rotating discs , where spiral arms and rotational shear set the conditions within which star formation continues at a moderate rate in present times . in the central regions of spiral galaxies , more ellipsoidal , largely stellar and pressure - supported components exist  nuclear star clusters , bulges , and `` bars '' , but the relative importance of these components varies among galaxies of this hubble class .",
    "what determines the presence or absence of these structures , and indeed the spiral arm pattern itself , is not understood .",
    "the local group galaxy triangulum ( hodierna 1654 )  hereafter referred to as m33 ( messier 1771 )  offers us a unique opportunity to study a spiral galaxy up close , and in particular to learn more about the structure and evolution of the central regions of such galaxy , that in our own milky way are heavily obscured by the intervening dusty disc ( van loon et al .",
    "2003 ; benjamin et al .",
    "our viewing angle with respect to the m33 disc is more favourable ( 56@xmath10  zaritsky , elston & hill 1989 ; deul & van der hulst 1987 ) than that of the larger m31 ( andromeda ) , whilst the distance to m33 is not much different from that to m31 ( @xmath11 mag  bonanos et al .",
    "the stellar content of m33 was summarised beautifully in the review by van den bergh ( 1991 ) .",
    "the present - day star formation rate in the central regions of m33 has been measured on the basis of optical photometry of massive main - sequence stars and h@xmath12 luminosity to be @xmath130.1 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 kpc@xmath3 ( wilson , scoville & rice 1991 ) .",
    "minniti , olszewski & rieke ( 1993 ) deduced from their infrared ( ir ) observations ( in the h - band at 1.6 @xmath14 m ) that a distinct star formation episode must have occurred in the `` bulge '' of m33 within the last gyr , unrelated to activity within the disc  they also showed that the bulge comprises also intermediate - age stars in contrast to the old , metal - poor halo of m33 .",
    "the structure of the central region was investigated further at ir wavelengths by regan & vogel ( 1994 ) and stephens & frogel ( 2002 ) ; the central nucleus had been described in detail also by lauer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "galactic evolution is driven at the end - points of stellar evolution , where copious mass loss returns chemically - enriched and sometimes dusty matter back to the interstellar medium ( ism ) ; the stellar winds of evolved stars and the violent deaths of the most massive stars also inject energy and momentum into the ism , generating turbulence and galactic fountains when superbubbles pop as they reach the `` surface '' of the galactic disc .",
    "the evolved stars are also excellent tracers , not just of the feedback processes , but also of the underlying populations , that were formed from millions to billions of years prior to their appearance",
    ". the evolved phases of evolution generally represent the most luminous , and often the coolest , making evolved stars brilliant beacons at ir wavelengths , where it is also easier to see them deep inside galaxies as dust is more tranpsarent at those longer wavelengths than in the optical and ultraviolet where their main - sequence progenitors shine .",
    "the final stages of stellar evolution of stars with main - sequence masses up to @xmath15 m@xmath1  asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars and red supergiants  are characterised by strong radial pulsations of the cool atmospheric layers , rendering them identifiable as long - period variables ( lpvs ) in photometric monitoring campaigns spanning months to years ( e.g. , whitelock , feast & catchpole 1991 ; wood 2000 ; ita et al .",
    "2004a , b ) .",
    "the main objectives of the project are : to construct the mass function of lpvs and derive from this the star formation history in m33 ; to correlate spatial distributions of the lpvs of different mass with galactic structures ( spheroid , disc and spiral arm components ) ; to measure the rate at which dust is produced and fed into the ism ; to establish correlations between the dust production rate , luminosity , and amplitude of an lpv ; and to compare the _ in situ _ dust replenishment with the amount of pre - existing dust ( see javadi , van loon & mirtorabi 2011b ) .",
    "this is paper ii in the series , describing the galactic structure and star formation history in the inner square kpc .",
    "paper i in the series presented the photometric catalogue of stars in the inner square kpc ( javadi , van loon and mirtorabi 2011a ) .",
    "subsequent papers in the series will discuss the mass - loss mechanism and dust production rate ( paper iii ) , and the extension to a nearly square degree area covering much of the m33 optical disc ( paper iv ) .",
    "in this section we briefly summarise the salient features of the catalogue of variable stars that we produced ( paper i ) , and of the stellar evolution models that we use here .      in paper",
    "i we described the search for large - amplitude , long - period variable stars in the central @xmath16 ( square kpc ) of m33 , with the uist imager on the united kingdom ir telescope ( ukirt ) on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "the monitoring was done predominantly in the k - band ( around a wavelength of @xmath17 @xmath14 m ) , with additional observations in the j- and h - bands ( @xmath18 and 1.65 @xmath14 m , respectively ) mostly for the purpose of obtaining colour information .",
    "observations were carried out if the near - ir stellar images were @xmath19 .",
    "each quadrant of the field was observed at least 11 times spread over the period 20032007 , with stars in overlap regions being observed more often .",
    "photometry was obtained via fitting of the empirically - derived point spread function to all stars detected above a threshold in terms of the local sky background noise .",
    "hence a catalogue of 18,398 stars was produced .",
    "1 shows these stars in a colour  magnitude diagram .",
    "the catalogue reaches a completeness level of @xmath20% above the rgb tip around @xmath21 mag . for this bright magnitude regime ,",
    "the photometric accuracy is @xmath22% , and blending is a concern in only @xmath23% of cases .",
    "contamination of the sample by stars in the galactic foreground was demonstrated to be negligible .",
    "the variability search was performed using the newtrial routine ( stetson 1993 ) on the basis of the `` @xmath24 '' variability index ( stetson 1996 ) , which includes an assessment of the variations in the measurements in comparison to the measurement uncertainties , both in terms of their ratio and distribution .",
    "hence 812 variables were found , with estimated k - band amplitudes in the range @xmath252 mag ( typically @xmath26 mag ) .",
    "their distribution over magnitude and colour is shown in fig .  1 ( in green ) .",
    "the best available theoretical models for our purpose are currently provided by the padova group ( marigo et al .",
    "2008 ) , for the following reasons :    * they span an adequate range in birth mass ( @xmath27 m@xmath1 ) , combining their own models for intermediate - mass stars ( @xmath28 m@xmath1 ) with padova models for more massive stars ( @xmath29 m@xmath1 ; bertelli et al .",
    "1994 ) ; * they are computed all the way through the thermal pulsing agb until they enter the post - agb phase , in a manner that is consistent with the computation of the preceding evolutionary stages .",
    "crucially , it includes the third dredge - up mixing of the stellar mantle as a result of the helium - burning pulses , as well as the enhanced luminosity of massive agb stars undergoing hot bottom burning ( hbb  iben & renzini 1983 ) ; * they include molecular opacities that are important for the cool atmospheres of red giants , allowing to describe the transformation from oxygen - dominated m - type agb stars to carbon stars in the approximate birth - mass range @xmath304 m@xmath1 ( cf .  girardi & marigo 2007 ) ; * they include predictions for dust production in the winds of lpvs and the associated reddening ; * they include predictions for the radial pulsation ; * they have been carefully transformed to various optical and ir photometric systems ; * they are available via a user - friendly internet interface .",
    "we encourage other groups to apply the same principles to their models , so that their fundamental differences can be explored empirically to the greatest effect . while we refer to marigo et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and marigo & girardi ( 2007 ) for the technical details pertaining to their models , and we have no way of replacing them by different models , we point out a few essential aspects of this set of padova models below",
    ".    the padova models do not include the effects of rotation or magnetic fields on mixing within the stellar interior . especially in massive stars",
    "these can have important consequences for their luminosities and lifetimes , making them brighter but live longer and evolve to cooler red supergiant stages ( cf.meynet & maeder 2000 ; heger , woosley & spruit 2005 ) .",
    "the padova models employ convective overshoot ( see marigo & girardi 2007 ) , which prolongs the lifetime of a star",
    ". hence stars of a given observed luminosity will be linked to older ages and lower birth masses than in other , classical models that do not allow for convective overshoot .",
    "this is mainly an issue for intermediate - age populations .",
    "the thermal pulsing agb is not computed by solving the equations governing the stellar internal structure , but in a synthetic way by adopting parameterisations which include the efficiency and threshold temperature at which third dredge - up sets in .",
    "these parameters have been calibrated empirically against observations , for instance of the carbon star luminosity function and star clusters in the magellanic clouds ( marigo & girardi 2007 ) .",
    "consequently , it is possible that these calibrations are not a perfect match to populations in galaxies other than the magellanic clouds . while stars in m33 are not vastly different from those in the lmc , stars in the nuclear region of m33 are probably more similar to solar - metallicity stars in the milky way .",
    "more critically important is to note that the published isochrones do _ not _ include the excursions in luminosity and temperature resulting from the thermal pulses , but only record the evolution through the hydrogen - shell burning phases . while the latter dominates also on the tp - agb , stars undergoing the thermal - pulse excursions",
    "may erroneously be assigned to lower or higher birth masses .",
    "this ultimately reduces the time resolution and contrast of the derived star formation history somewhat .    the radial pulsation properties ( period and mode )",
    "are computed as a function of luminosity .",
    "stars are expected to start pulsating in the first overtone as soon as the thermal pulses start .",
    "the luminosity at which the transition to the fundamental mode occurs is based upon the linear pulsation models from ostlie & cox ( 1986 ) , while periods are computed from the mass and radius based upon models from fox & wood ( 1982 )  with some modifications to detail as described in marigo & girardi ( 2007 ; their section 2.7 ) and marigo et al.(2008 ; their appendix ) . for the purpose of our work",
    "the main important feature is the lifetime of the pulsation phase , not so much the mode or period .",
    "the revisions made by marigo et al .",
    "( 2008 ) reduced the pulsation lifetime of the most massive agb stars by a factor of 25 , which in our analysis would lead to an increase in the associated star formation rate by the same amount ( see section 3.2 ) .",
    "spectral templates used to describe the photospheric emission of the coolest giants come from empirical libraries for m - type stars ( fluks et al .",
    "1994 ) or synthetic spectra for carbon stars ( loidl , lanon & jrgensen 2001 )",
    ". these may not always be entirely appropriate , for instance at a different metallicity , carbon - to - oxygen ratio or dynamical state of the pulsating atmosphere .",
    "but the uncertainty in the bolometric corrections is modest in the near - ir , likely @xmath31 mag at k , and thus not a serious concern for our project .",
    "mass loss truncates the evolution of agb stars , depleting their mantles and thereby avoiding the explosion of agb stars of @xmath32 m@xmath1 .",
    "this becomes important when the mass - loss rates exceed the nuclear burning rate ( van loon et al .",
    "mass loss also reduces the effective temperature and increases the pulsation period , as the less - massive mantle inflates .",
    "because all this happens quite suddenly , it is as important to accurately predict _ when _ this happens , as it is to accurately predict the _ rate _ of mass loss that is attained .",
    "the formalism adopted in the padova models is based upon parameterisation with respect to pulsation period ( cf .",
    "vassialidis & wood 1993 ) . while this has observational support it does mean that the accuracy of the predicted mass loss relies critically on the model s accuracy with which it predicts the pulsation properties .",
    "alternative prescriptions for mass loss exist that are defined in terms of luminosity and temperature ( van loon et al .",
    "mass loss is not as dramatic an issue for massive stars , which do explode before shedding their mantle through stellar mass loss , though mass loss could have an effect on the time these stars spend as a red supergiant .",
    "mass loss from cool stars also affects the photometric appearance of the star , as dust forming in the wind gives rise to selective extinction and thus diminishing brightness and reddening at optical / near - ir wavelengths .",
    "the effect at near - ir wavelengths only becomes noticeable in the case of very dense circumstellar envelopes .",
    "the padova models incorporate these effects in a two - step procedure : ( 1 ) predict the radial density of the dust envelope , and ( 2 ) compute the resulting extinction of starlight at short wavelengths , and re - emission by the grains at long wavelengths .",
    "the first step is based mainly on the predictions from ferrarotti & gail ( 2006 ) whilst the second step follows standard radiative transfer computations as in groenewegen ( 2006 ) .",
    "the adopted wind structure and dust content have observational support ( e.g. , marshall et al .",
    "2004 ) but there can be many reasons for deviations from this standard , simplistic picture . likewise , the optical properties of the grains that are adopted in the radiative transfer computations are reasonable ( typical astronomical silicates or aluminium oxides for m - type stars and a mixture of amorphous carbon and silicate carbide for carbon stars ) but not without uncertainties . for the purpose of the analysis presented here ,",
    "the most important uncertainty is in the direction of the reddening vector in the near - ir colour  magnitude diagram .",
    "this is explored in some detail in sections 3.1.1 and 4.1.1 .",
    "an important remaining uncertainty in the padova models concerns the evolution of super - agb stars , with birth - masses @xmath3310 m@xmath1 ( siess 2007 ) , which in their models are not computed all the way through the thermal pulsing phase and thus appear to terminate their evolution prematurely .",
    "we explore the consequences in this paper and offer some guidance to the models .",
    "1 includes several representative isochrones , which show good correspondence to the observed sequences of stars .",
    "the main regions in this diagram where massive stars , agb stars and rgb stars are found are demarcated ( see section 4.2 ) .",
    "red agb stars or massive stars , at @xmath34 mag , are almost exclusively lpvs affected by _ circumstellar _",
    "reddening ; _ interstellar _ reddening was proven to be unimportant ( see paper i ) .",
    "the reddened stars form a minority among the sample of lpvs , but it is encouraging to see that the isochrones cover the regime of reddened lpvs fairly well .",
    "the star formation history ( sfh ) is described by the star formation rate ( sfr ) , @xmath35 , as a function of lapsed time , @xmath36 .",
    "this function quantifies how many solar masses of gas are converted into stars per year , and we here express it per unit area projected on the sky .",
    "the combined mass of stars created between times @xmath36 and @xmath37 is : @xmath38 this corresponds to a number , @xmath39 , of stars formed : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the initial mass function , defined by : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the normalization constant and @xmath12 depends on the mass range , following kroupa ( 2001 ) : @xmath44 the minimum and maximum of the stellar mass range are adopted to be 0.02 and 200 m@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "reasonable changes in these values will result in changes in the star formation rate by hardly more than a factor two .",
    "the question is how many of these stars , @xmath45 , are variable stars around time @xmath36 which is when we observe them .",
    "suppose stars with mass between @xmath46 and @xmath47 satisfy this condition , then the number of variable stars created between times @xmath36 and @xmath37 is : @xmath48 combining the above equations we have : @xmath49    when we determine @xmath50 over an age bin @xmath51 , the number of variable stars observed in that age bin , @xmath52 , depends on the duration of variability , @xmath53 , so : @xmath54 inverting the above equations we obtain a relation between the observed number of variable stars in a certain age bin , and the star formation rate that long ago : @xmath55 note that the value of the normalization constant @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( 3 ) does not matter here .",
    "lpvs , which dominate the large - amplitude variables identified in our ir monitoring programme , have reached the very final stages of their evolution , and their brightness can thus be translated into their mass at birth by employing theoretical evolutionary tracks , or in this case just as well by isochrones .",
    "inspection of the isochrones confirms that stars are at their brightest in the k - band ( @xmath56 @xmath14 m ) when they also develop the pulsations that give rise to their large - amplitude variability .",
    "hence we constructed the mass  luminosity relation for the k - band as depicted in fig .  2 ( low- to intermediate - mass range ) and fig .  3 ( which includes the most massive stars ) , for four different values of the overall metallicity , from super - solar  as in massive elliptical galaxies and sub - populations in the bulges of massive spiral galaxies such as the milky way  to sub - solar values appropriate for the large and small magellanic clouds .",
    "there are small but noticeable differences .",
    "the central region of m33 is characterised by approximately solar - metallicity ism ( rosolowsky & simon 2008 ; magrini et al.2009 ) and young and intermediate - age stellar populations ( massey et al .",
    "1996 ; minniti et al .",
    "1993 ) , but also given that older stars will tend to have lower metallicities we err on the side of caution and adopt the @xmath57 result , which is either consistent with solar metallicity or slightly sub - solar metallicity depending on the exact metallicity adopted for the sun ( @xmath57 is close to the value for the sun determined in recent years  cf .",
    "asplund et al",
    ".  2009 ) .",
    "the mass  luminosity relations show small excursions in places , e.g. , for @xmath58 mag at @xmath59 , which could be related to differences in the bolometric corrections of m - type and carbon stars .",
    "however , some inaccuracies result from limited accuracy in the models as well as the time - sampling of the evolutionary tracks and isochrones , and where there is doubt we interpolate over these small excursions by means of a spline fit , rendering a well - behaved function .    for @xmath601.3",
    ", the isochrones suggest an excursion towards fainter k - band magnitudes ( fig .",
    "3 ) , but as noted earlier the models were not computed through to the end of the evolution of these super - agb stars ( and possibly stars at the lower end of the mass range for red supergiants ) . in our analysis , we follow two different approaches , and investigate the impact on the derived star formation history :    * we interpolate the mass  luminosity realtion ( and the mass  pulsation duration relation , see further ) over this mass range to connect the final luminosities of agb stars to those of massive red supergiants in a monotonic manner . stars with @xmath61 do not appear to become red supergiants and they are therefore not expected to exhibit periodic large - amplitude variability .",
    "this is our preferred solution , which we vindicate in section 4.1.5 ; * we accept the jump to fainter magnitudes from agb to super - agb stars .",
    "this is an extreme measure , as we believe super - agb stars should reach high luminosities as they undergo hbb , though more massive red supergiants do not .",
    "we postpone following this choice to section 4.1.5 , where we show that it leads to physically unrealistic results .",
    "the coefficients of the best fitting function are obtained by minimisation of @xmath62 with the iraf task nfit1d except where it was deemed more appropriate to be guided by two end - points of isochrones , in which case no estimates of uncertainty are attached . for case ( 1 ) the function is described in table 1 .",

    "however , the k - band magnitude of a star seen through a high dust column density is diminished , and should be corrected to the value on the mass  luminosity relation .",
    "although the isochrones of marigo et al .",
    "( 2008 ) include the effects of circumstellar dust formation , these are very uncertain and we prefer a simple de - reddening procedure .",
    "this would also naturally account for any additional interstellar extinction , at least to some extent .",
    "the de - reddening correction is related to the colour and magnitude of a star . in fig .  1 we show the marigo et al .  ( 2008 ) isochrones for a range of ages .",
    "it immediately becomes clear that the reddening for carbon stars ( e.g. , at @xmath154 gyr i.e.  @xmath155 ) differs from that of oxygen - rich stars ( e.g. , at @xmath156 gyr i.e.  @xmath157 ) , the former more quickly reddening compared to the extinction in the k - band .",
    "the average slope of the reddening of carbon stars is 0.52 mag of k - band extinction per magnitude of @xmath158 reddening , whilst it is 0.72 mag mag@xmath2 for oxygen - rich stars .",
    "the locus to which we translate the reddened star is at @xmath159 mag , but we apply the correction to those variable stars that have @xmath34 mag to allow some deviations from the unreddened locus as a result of photometric inaccuracies and variability .",
    "hence the correction equation is : @xmath160 if only k- and h - band data are available but no j - band data",
    "then we apply the following correction derived from the k versus h  k diagram : @xmath161 in the case where only k - band but no j- nor h - band data are available , we adopt @xmath162 mag ( roughyl equivalent to where we start losing stars too red for our survey depth ) , and use eq .",
    "the constants in these equations are @xmath163 for carbon stars and @xmath164 for oxygen - rich stars .",
    "it is thus important to know which stars have carbonaceous dust and which ones have oxygeneous dust .",
    "as described in paper i , the only catalogue available that uses an identification technique based on specific spectral features is the one published by rowe et al .",
    "then , following the recommendation by those auhtors , we set limits on the photometric errors in their catalogue of @xmath165 mag , resulting in just three variable carbon stars .",
    "this is insufficient to decide which red stars in our catalogue are likely to be carbon stars . setting no limit on errors resulted in five variable carbon stars , of which three have @xmath34 mag .",
    "however , we expect from theory and observations in the lmc ( groenewegen & de jong 1993 ; van loon , marshall & zijlstra 2005 ; girardi & marigo 2007 ) that solar and slightly sub - solar metallicity carbon stars arise from stars in a birth mass range of @xmath1664 m@xmath1 : @xmath167 dredge - up is not strong enough to turn lower - mass agb stars into carbon stars , while hbb prevents carbon to enrich the surface of more massive agb stars .",
    "hence we first apply the carbon - dust correction to all reddened stars ",
    "if the derived mass is in the 1.54 m@xmath1 range then we accept that star as a carbon star , else we apply the oxygeneous dust correction .    in fig .",
    "4 we show the resulting pmf for the variable stars in the central square kpc of m33 .",
    "as indicated in paper i , nine of the large - amplitude variable stars show indications of blending so we removed those stars from our anlysis and we derive the star formation history using the remaining 803 variables .",
    "we applied the de - reddening correction as described above , as well as _ only _ a carbonaceous dust correction and _ only _ an oxygeneous dust correction : the differences are slight and mostly reflected in an @xmath168% scatter in the @xmath169 m@xmath1 region .",
    "( 1 ) contains a correction factor for the duration in which a star is seen to pulsate with large amplitude .",
    "for instance , massive stars evolve faster and are captured in their pulsating phase only briefly , whereas lower - mass stars spend longer in that phase and are thus more likely and more numerous to appear in variability surveys  aside from the effects of the imf , and of the sfh that we are after .    to derive this correction we followed the predictions from the marigo et al.(2008 ) isochrones , so as to be consistent within our analysis .",
    "the isochrone tables indicate the phase of strong radial pulsation , and we take this entire duration as the time during which the star would have been identified in our survey ( paper i ) as a variable star .",
    "we derived a function of mass for this duration of pulsation by fitting a multiple - gaussian function to these isochrone values .",
    "as we investigate two cases  one in which we interpolate between the most massive agb stars and the more massive red supergiants , and another in which we accept the regression in k - band brightness over the super - agb star mass regime  we also take these two approaches with regard to the pulsation - duration versus mass function ( the mass  pulsation relation ) : if the super - agb stars _ do _ evolve to higher luminosities and cooler temperatures then they will also be more likely to , and longer , pulsate .",
    "hence , for case ( 1 ) we fitted three gaussian funtions to the mass  pulsation diagram and interpolated over the same mass range as in the mass  luminosity diagram .",
    "the result is tabulated in table 2 and shown in fig .",
    "5 ( top panel ) . for case",

    "these estimates assume that there has not been a net migration into or out of the central square kpc region that we have monitored . especially for the older stars this may not be true , and they could have preferentially migrated out of the central region as a result of dynamical relaxation ( cf.van loon et al .",
    "so the star formation rate  and total stellar mass formed  that we derive for ages @xmath296 gyr ( @xmath297 ) may have been underestimated .",
    "long , charles & dubus ( 2002 ) determined that the nucleus ( central few arcsec ) of m33 underwent two discrete epochs of star formation , one a gyr ago ( @xmath298 ) which formed 4% of the @xmath299 m@xmath1 in stellar mass in the nuclear star cluster ( cf .",
    "kormendy & mcclure 1993 ) , and another only @xmath300 myr ago ( @xmath301 ) which added just half a per cent to the cluster s mass .",
    "curiously , while timed differently ( though with a degree of uncertainty ) , this resembles the increment in stellar mass ( 6% ) that we found to have formed within the past 0.5 gyr ( @xmath294 ) in the surrounding central disc . at the star formation rate that we derived for the past 20 myr ( @xmath286 ) ,",
    "the most recent of the two star formation events in the nucleus would have lasted approximately one myr ( @xmath302 ) , which is a typical timescale for star cluster formation .",
    "these comparisons are suggestive of some connection between the nucleus and surrounding disc , and possibly of a more similar timing of events .      in this section",
    "we examine how the derived sfh changes if we change our assumptions : the selection or omission of reddened stars , the amplitude threshold , the distance modulus , and the treatment of the super - agb stars .",
    "we can examine the contribution of the reddened stars to the sfh that we derive from the large - amplitude variables .",
    "our catalogue of variable stars in the central square kpc of m33 contains 318 stars that have @xmath34 mag ( but one of these is removed because it was affected by blending ) , which corresponds to the significant fraction of 39% of all variable stars .",
    "these stars need a correction to their k - band magnitudes .",
    "much redder stars , though rarer , may have been missed entirely by less ir - sensitive surveys . of all reddened stars ,",
    "45% were identified as variable . of the remaining 55%",
    ", some might well also be variable stars not identified as such in our survey , though it is likely that some fraction of this concerns non - variable stars seen behind interstellar dust clouds .",
    "8 shows the sfh we derive based solely on reddened ( @xmath34 mag ) variable stars identified in our survey . as before",
    ", a mass - dependent de - reddening correction has been applied to account for a mixture of carbon and oxygen - rich stars .",
    "two things stand out immediately : the major historical star formation epoch at 410 gyr ( @xmath27410 ) disappeared and also the sfr in the most recent 250 myr ( @xmath303 ) has dropped . on the other hand , reddened stars dominate the variable stars associated with the sfr derived at intermediate ages , 0.252.5 gyr ago ( @xmath3039.4 ) .",
    "most of these are expected to be carbon stars .",
    "clearly , massive and low - mass stars do not feature prominently among the reddened stars .",
    "we argue , as we did in paper i , that the low - mass stars may become very red ( and thus be missed even by our ir survey ) but possibly only very late in their pulsating phase , whilst massive stars do not envelope themselves in optically - thick dust envelopes except in the most extreme , and thus rare cases ( cf .",
    "van loon et al .",
    "1997 ) . in conclusion , to obtain a complete sfh based on variable stars",
    "one must account for reddened stars so as to not underestimate the sfr at intermediate ages , while the earliest and most recent sfr is determined by optically bright(er ) variable stars .",
    "our decision to only correct for reddening stars with @xmath34 mag , and to correct them to a locus of @xmath159 mag , may introduce some uncertainty .",
    "if either choice were made differently , the corrected brightness and hence inferred birth mass and thus age would be different .",
    "we had introduced the 0.25 mag `` buffer '' between the locus of unreddened stars and the threshold for correcting for reddening , to allow for photometric uncertainty which , if corrected as if it were due to reddening would lead to systematic deviations .",
    "the photometric uncertainty in the colour is typically @xmath304 mag ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the amplitudes of variability are typically 0.6 mag ; while the colours vary less , with only a few measurements in the bands other than the k - band the time - average colours may be inaccurate by a few tenths of a magnitude .",
    "this , and the morphology in the colour  magnitude diagram ( fig .  1 ) , supports a @xmath34 mag threshold .",
    "one could argue for a shift of this , or of the unreddened locus , by 0.1 mag or so , but this would only lead to a shift ( largely systematic ) in unreddened k - band brightness by a similar magnitude .",
    "this would resemble varying the distance modulus by such amount . in section 4.1.3",
    "we investigate such shift but by as much as 0.4 mag .",
    "the effect of a 0.1 mag adjustment appears to be of little significance .",
    "how sensitive is the derived sfh to the exact threshold of our survey to the detection of variability ?",
    "to gain some idea of this effect , we set a selection threshold on the estimated k - band amplitude ( cf .",
    "paper i ) of @xmath305 mag .",
    "this leaves us with 581 variable stars ( excluding 9 stars affected by blending ",
    "see paper i ) , still nearly 3/4 of the original selection .",
    "it is likely that more stars were removed that have either low or high mass , as the former may not pulsate as vigorously ( mcdonald et al .",
    "2010 ) while the latter do but not in terms of magnitude  which is a relative quantity , in relation to their high luminosity ( cf .",
    "van loon et al .  2008 ) .",
    "9 shows the resulting sfh .",
    "the overall trend is little affected .",
    "apart from an overall modest drop in the sfr , the effect seems to affect mostly the massive stars formed in the past 400 myr ( @xmath306 ) .",
    "the smaller amplitudes of low - mass stars is not apparent , but our sfh also does not extend into the past as far as the ages of old galactic globular clusters ( @xmath307 gyr i.e.  @xmath308 ) upon which the evidence for diminished pulsation in low - mass red giants is largely based .",
    "in our analysis we adopted a distance modulus of @xmath11 mag , which is found by several authors via different methods including eclipsing binaries , and which was found to match the theoretical isochrones quite well to our ir colour  magnitude diagrams .",
    "however , some authors have found lower values for the distance modulus , around @xmath309 mag ( scowcroft et al .",
    "2009 ) . changing",
    "the distance modulus will change the absolute magnitude of stars and hence also the mass of stars , but the mass  pulsation relation will remain unchanged as it does not depend on distance .",
    "this means that changing the distance modulus will affect the sfh we derive .",
    "10 shows the sfh for @xmath11 ( as before ) and @xmath309 mag .",
    "overall the sfh has a similar behaviour despite the 20% difference in distance , with a major ancient epoch of star formation and enhanced star formation in recent times .",
    "however , not surprisingly , the sfh is shifted towards earlier epochs .",
    "the sfr seems to be diminished at all later times ; this is caused by the same effect , stars having been shifted to earlier times , piling up at ages @xmath310 gyr ( @xmath311 ) .",
    "while the metallicity of the pulsating red giants in the centre of m33 is quite reliably known , the oldest pulsating stars might be somewhat deficient in metals compared to the young and intermediate - age @xmath57 population that formed after the initial period of star formation from which most chemical enrichment resulted .",
    "investigating the metallicity dependence of our results also lays the foundation for the application of the method to the outskirts of the m33 disc , or to altogether different galaxies .",

    "table 2 ) and mass  age relation ( fig .  6 ; table 3 ) have all been determined for four different values of the metallicity : @xmath312 ( appropriate for the small magellanic cloud ) , @xmath313 ( appropriate for the large magellanic cloud ) , @xmath57 ( appropriate for the centre of m33 ) and @xmath59 ( super - solar ) .",
    "the resulting star formation histories are shown in fig .",
    "the result from adopting @xmath313 hardly differs from the one we obtained for @xmath57 .",
    "apart from pushing the early epoch of star formation back by one or two gyr there are no important deviations outside a @xmath314% margin . adopting @xmath59",
    "mainly extends the early epoch of star formation to as recent as 2 gyr ago ( @xmath315 )  the star formation rate would become fairly constant over the entire history of m33 except for a lull in activity @xmath3162 gyr ago ( @xmath3179.3 ) .",
    "this strange result can be dismissed as such high metallicity is an unrealistic choice for m33 .",
    "adopting @xmath312 yields a `` burst '' of star formation 0.21 gyr ago ( @xmath3189 ) ; whilst not impossible this is attributable to the shorter duration of pulsation predicted by the models ( fig .",
    "5 ) for the birth mass range of 24 m@xmath1 ( @xmath3190.6 ; these are carbon stars ) in combination with the observed high numbers of pulsating stars in that mass range .",
    "this low metallicity is not characteristic of the m33 population . in conclusion , the results we have derived by adopting @xmath57 are robust against reasonable deviations from this value for the metallicity .",
    "previously , we have interpolated the mass  luminosity and mass  pulsation relations across the super - agb and low - mass red supergiant regime , as the theoretical models had not been computed until the very end of these stars evolution and we may thus have missed the coolest , strongly - pulsating phases that these stars experience before ending their lives . here , we examine how our results change if we do take the endpoints of the theoretical isochrones at face value .",
    "12 shows the revised mass  luminosity relation : the agb portion , at @xmath320 , remains unchanged but the description of the more massive portion has been altered to follow the isochrones more closely ( table 4 ) .",
    "we still keep that portion in itself monotonic , for simplicity .",
    "the small ranges where the slope has the opposite sign will not make a very different contribution because of this . clearly , however , stars of @xmath321 magnitude have two solutions for the mass , and we will need to devise some procedure to distribute the stars over these two solutions .",

    "1 ) : we define a demarcation line between hot massive stars and cooler , less - massive giant stars to run from @xmath386 to @xmath387 mag , with massive stars those that have j  k colours bluer than this ( down to @xmath388 mag ) or that have @xmath389 mag , and agb stars and rgb stars those that have j  k colours redder than this and that have @xmath390 mag ( agb ) or @xmath391 mag ( rgb , which does extend to much fainter magnitudes than our survey completeness ) .",
    "we left small gaps to avoid contamination .",
    "we consider two types of galactic structures : disc - related and spheroidal .",
    "the former have axi - symmetry in the galaxy plane and are otherwise `` flat '' ( with relatively little depth ) , while the latter have a surface density that is invariant to inclination with respect to the plane of the sky ( as long as internal extinction is negligible , which we have shown in paper i is largely the case for our near - ir survey )",
    ". to investigate the disc - related structures , we must deproject the positions of stars on the image to the galaxy plane  but for the spheroidal structures we must make sure _ not _ to do that . to deproject , we first rotate the image according to the position angle of @xmath392 and then stretch the coordinates along the direction of inclination according to an inclination angle of @xmath393 ( zaritsky et al .",
    "1989 ) .",
    "the radial distributions of stars as measured in the galaxy plane are shown in fig .",
    "these are fitted with an adaptation for the stellar number density of the surface brightness function from srsic ( 1963 ) : @xmath394 where @xmath395 returns the de vaucouleurs profile typical of galaxy bulges ( de vaucouleurs 1953 ) and @xmath396 an exponential disc .",
    "the calibration of the srsic profile is such that half the intensity ( number of stars in our case ) falls within @xmath397 .",
    "the parameter @xmath398 can be derived exactly from comparison of the complete and incomplete gamma functions ( ciotti 1991 ) , and approximately from @xmath399 for @xmath400 ( capaccioli 1989 ) .",
    "the fit parameters are listed in table 6 .",
    "the agb distribution shows clear signs of a double - component profile , with the break occurring around @xmath401 kpc , so in this case we fitted a srsic profile , with @xmath402 kpc , plus a pure exponential disc profile : @xmath403 this corroborates the result found by kormendy & kennicutt ( 2004 ) for the surface brightness profile : a srsic profile with @xmath404 and @xmath405 dominating the inner part with the outer part described by an exponential disc .",
    "clearly , the agb stars do not constitute a `` bulge '' , which would have had @xmath45 closer to 4 .",
    "apart from the pure ( rotating ) disc component the nuclear part could possibly resemble a pseudo - bulge ( which is a disc phenomenon and as such has @xmath45 also close to 1 ) .",
    "the rgb population shows no strong central condensation , and a large effective radius @xmath406 kpc .",
    "this is easy to understand as the rgb stars have had many gyr to relax within the overall gravitational potential of the entire m33 galaxy . the massive star population too , while more centrally concentrated than the rgb population , is spread throughout the m33 disc , without a strong nuclear component .",
    "this suggests that steady star formation takes place throughout the m33 disc , with only a marginal concentration towards the nucleus .",
    "possibly , the epochs of enhanced star formation _ are _ a feature of the central regions of m33 , leading to the lasting imprint in the agb stars distribution in the form of a pseudo - bulge .    the radial distributions of stars as measured in the image plane",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "these are fitted with one of the various king models ( king 1962 ) : @xmath407 the fit parameters are listed in table 6 .",
    "interestingly , the fits are not significantly better or worse than for the srsic profiles fitted in the galaxy plane . while it may seem reasonable to expect that the old rgb stars constitute a pressure - supported , more spheroidal system",
    ", the success of the srsic fit with a small value for @xmath45 suggests that perhaps they form part of a more flattened system . in either case",
    "the rgb population has the largest characteristic radius among the three populations .",
    "the massive stars and at least a fraction of the intermediate - age agb stars are not expected to reside in a spheroidal configuration , as they form within the gas - rich disc and will not have had time to reconfigure into a dynamically relaxed system  for these populations the srsic profile fits yield more plausible results .",

    "16 ; the radius is defined in the galaxy plane ) .",
    "this suggests that star formation has gradually become more concentrated towards the central regions , or that star formation has always been concentrated towards the core with dynamical relaxation having dispersed stars as time went by .",
    "we stress that we are looking here at variations within the inner square kpc , and that further out the situation might well differ",
    ".    one could wonder whether we are already noticing the gravitational potential responsible for the spiral arm pattern that so clearly defines m33 . or",
    ", would the pseudo - bulge be tri - axial , like a bar potential ? in either case",
    "we would expect an azimuthal modulation with two maxima and two minima offset by an angle @xmath410 . in fig .",
    "17 we plot these distributions for the three stellar populations , both in the image plane as well as in the galaxy plane .",
    "these distributions are constructed only for stars within circular areas in the image and galaxy planes , respectively , so as not to introduce spurious modulations due to the corners of the image resulting from the generally falling stellar surface density with distance to the galaxy centre .",
    "the agb population seems not to show any significant azimuthal structure in the image plane , but in the galaxy plane it does show the modulation expected from a bar or two - armed spiral arm pattern , with stellar surface density peaks around @xmath411 and @xmath412 , i.e.  roughly in the east and west directions .",
    "the rgb population shows a similar distribution in the galaxy plane , with an enhancement also visible in the image plane around @xmath413@xmath414 , i.e.  westwards .",
    "the massive stars , on the other hand , show a clear overdensity towards the south , @xmath415 .",
    "the photometric catalogue of javadi et al .",
    "( 2011a ) was used to reconstruct the star formation history and structure of the inner square kpc of m33 .",
    "the numbers and luminosities of the pulsating agb stars and red supergiants were converted to star formation rates as a function of look - back time , using recent padova stellar evolution models ( marigo et al .",
    "consistency checks between the predicted luminosities and pulsation durations and the derived star formation rates lend strong support for these models except that the super - agb stars must also reach high luminosities and pulsate for a considerable amount of time to avoid implausible values for the inferred star formation rates .",
    "this also supports the interpretation of dust - enshrouded supernovae as being due to super - agb star progenitors .",
    "our conclusions pertaining to the star formation history in the centre of m33 can be summarised as follows :    * the disc of m33 was built @xmath4 gyr ago ( @xmath416 ) , when @xmath5% of the historic star formation in m33 occurred .",
    "* shorter epochs of enhanced star formation ( may ) have occurred since then ; the most recent substantial example of such event occurred @xmath417 myr ago ( @xmath418 ) and contributed @xmath7% to m33 s historic star formation . * a minor star formation event which had been suggested to have occurred within the nuclear star cluster within the past @xmath300 myr ( @xmath419 )",
    "can also be discerned in our data suggesting this was a more wide - spread phenomenon .",
    "the formation epoch of m33 around @xmath420 gyr is in line with the peak in the distribution of formation epochs of bulgeless galaxies in a standard @xmath9-cdm cosmological model , around redshift @xmath421 ( fontanot et al.2011 ) corresponding to ages @xmath422 gyr .",
    "we speculate that more recent star formation epochs may have been induced by interaction with the neighbouring more massive andromeda spiral galaxy ( m31 ; richardson et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "comparison with the historical drawing of m33 by r.j .",
    "mitchell and published in lord rosse s records shows a reasonable correspondence between the footpoints of the spiral - arm pattern revealed in the unresolved white light and the density enhancements that we recorded ( fig .",
    "the two main spiral arms seem to originate around @xmath423@xmath424 and @xmath425 with a southern spur visible close to the centre .",
    "the spiral arms may be associated with the overdensities in agb stars and rgb stars , though it would be somewhat coincidental that the signal in the agb distribution is so perfectly cancelled by the projection on the sky .",
    "also , one might not have expected a signal this clear in the distribution of rgb stars , if these occupy a more spheroidal , dynamically - relaxed distribution .",
    "possibly we are dealing with a bar - like feature , which is a disc - related structure and may be connected to the footpoints of the spiral arms  in fact the srsic index @xmath4260.8 is smaller than that of a pure exponential disc , with galactic bars generally having @xmath426 .    the southern spur , on the other hand , can be associated with the overdensity of massive stars , which are displayed on our ufti image ( fig .",
    "this includes a prominent cluster at @xmath427 ) .",
    "the southern spur is also prominent in ultraviolet images obtained with the ultraviolet imaging telescope on - board space shuttle columbia ( landsman et al .",
    "note also that the region within @xmath428 is actually rather devoid of massive stars ; this is also where the pseudo - bulge ( or bar ) is seen , which therefore seems to be a predominantly intermediate - age feature .",
