    "conventionally , on quantization of the hamiltonian constraint , the su(2 ) valued holonomies in the gravitational part traces over the @xmath4 fundamental representation , while in the matter part the su(2 ) representation can be freely specified to define the inverse volume resulting in the quantization ambiguity known as inverse scale factor modification . based on such quantum hamiltonian constraint",

    "it shows that in the semiclassical region the gravitational hamiltonian gets modification similar to the inverse volume modification in the matter part .",
    "this is because that , in the classical hamiltonian constraint , both the gravitational part and matter part contain inverse volume terms , and , for quantization , promoting the inverse volume into poisson bracket between the volume and the holonomies leads to the same quantization ambiguity @xcite .",

    "we find that the inverse volume modification in the gravity sector raised by a bigger quantization ambiguity parameter @xmath5 could decrease the energy scale at the bounce point . and , whether a bounce really happens or not depends on whether the matter density at the high energy region attains the bouncing energy scale .",
