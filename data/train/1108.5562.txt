    "since the liquid drop model was developed @xcite , the quadrupole shape coordinates were widely used by both phenomenological and microscopic formalisms to describe the basic properties of nuclear systems .",
    "based on these coordinates , one defines quadrupole boson operators in terms of which model hamiltonians and transition operators are defined . since the original spherical harmonic liquid drop model was able to describe only a small amount of data for spherical nuclei , several improvements have been added .",
    "thus , the bohr - mottelson model was generalized by faessler and greiner@xcite in order to describe the small oscillations around a deformed shape which results in obtaining a flexible model , called vibration rotation model ( vrm ) , suitable for the description of deformed nuclei .",
    "later on @xcite this picture was extended by including anharmonicities as low order invariant polynomials in the quadrupole coordinates . with a suitable choice of the parameters involved in the model hamiltonian the equipotential energy surface may exhibit several types of minima @xcite like spherical , deformed prolate , deformed oblate , deformed triaxial , etc . to each equilibrium shape , specific properties for excitation energies and electromagnetic transition probabilities show up . due to this reason",
    ", one customarily says that static values of intrinsic coordinates determine a phase for the nuclear system . a weak point of the boson description with a complex anharmonic hamiltonian consists of the large number of the structure parameters which are to be fitted",
    ". a much smaller number of parameters is used by the coherent state model ( csm ) @xcite which uses a restricted collective space generated through angular momentum projection by three deformed orthogonal functions of coherent type .",
    "the model is able to describe in a realistic fashion transitional and well deformed nuclei of various shapes including states of high and very high angular momentum .",
    "various extensions to include other degrees of freedom like isospin @xcite , single particle@xcite or octupole degrees@xcite of freedom have been formulated@xcite .",
    "it has been noticed that a given nuclear phase may be associated to a certain symmetry .",
    "hence , its properties may be described with the help of the irreducible representation of the respective symmetry group .",
    "thus , the gamma unstable nuclei can be described by the @xmath0 symmetry @xcite , the gamma triaxial nuclei by the rigid triaxial rotor @xmath1 symmetry @xcite , the symmetric rotor by the @xmath2 symmetry and the spherical vibrator by the @xmath3 symmetry . thus , even in the 50 s , the symmetry properties have been greatly appreciated . however",
    ", a big push forward was brought by the interacting boson approximation ( iba ) @xcite , which succeeded to describe the basic properties of a large number of nuclei in terms of the symmetries associated to the system of quadrupole ( d ) and monopole ( s ) bosons which generate a @xmath4 algebra .",
    "the three limiting symmetries @xmath3 , @xmath0 , @xmath2 mentioned above , are dynamic symmetries for @xmath4 . moreover , for each of these symmetries a specific group reduction chain provides the quantum numbers characterizing the states , which are suitable for a certain region of nuclei .",
    "besides the virtue of unifying the group theoretical descriptions of nuclei exhibiting different symmetries , the procedure defines very simple reference pictures for the limiting cases . for nuclei lying close to the region characterized by a certain symmetry ,",
    "the perturbative corrections are to be included . in refs.@xcite",
    "it was shown that the critical points of some transitions correspond themselves to certain symmetries which may be described by the solutions of specific differential equations .",
    "many publications developing the mentioned formalisms as well advancing new approaches have been accumulated along the time . to mention them",
    "would take too much space and moreover one meet the risk of omitting involuntary some valuable contribution . due to these reason we shall mention only those papers which are related to the present work .",
    "the present paper is devoted to a systematic study of the csm approach . in performing the present investigation , we have been stimulated by our previous publication @xcite where the ground band energies for states of angular momentum going up to high values ( 36 ) and for a large number of nuclei ( 44 ) , have been described with very high accuracy with very simple and compact formulas .",
    "thus , in a way this work is a natural extension of the procedure of the quoted paper to the excited bands .",
    "the exact and complex formulas for the matrix elements of the model hamiltonian as well as of the e2 transition operator have been expanded in power series of a deformation variable x ( @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a real parameter which simulates the nuclear deformation ) for small deformation and in power series of @xmath7 when the nuclear deformation is large . as a result",
    ", analytical compact formulas are obtained for both excitation energies and quadrupole electric transition probabilities .",
    "these formulas are positively tested for a large number of nuclei .",
    "the above mentioned project was achieved according to the following plan .",
    "the basic ideas of the csm approach are shortly reviewed in section ii .",
    "the near vibrational regime is described in section iii , while the asymptotic expansion for large deformations is given in section iv .",
    "numerical applications are presented in section v and the final conclusions are summarized in section vi .",
    "the model proposed in ref.@xcite is known under the name of csm ( coherent state model ) and aims at describing in a realistic fashion the lowest three rotational bands , ground , beta and gamma . here",
    "we describe briefly the basic ingredients .",
    "first one builds up a collective boson space being guided by the experimental picture .",
    "thus , each band is generated by projecting the angular momentum from three orthogonal deformed states which modeled the ground , beta and gamma bands respectively , in the intrinsic frame of reference .",
    "the deformed ground band state is an axially deformed coherent state @xmath8 , while the other two intrinsic states are orthogonal polynomial excitations of the ground band model function .",
    "these excitations were chosen such that they are mutually orthogonal both before and after angular momentum projection .",
    "all three states are depending on a real parameter @xmath6 which simulates the nuclear deformation .",
    "in the limit @xmath9 the projected states must go to the first three highest seniority states of the boson multiplets while in the asymptotic region , i.e. large value for @xmath6 , the states written in the intrinsic frame of reference have expressions similar to those associated to the liquid drop model , in the strong coupling regime . by this requirement",
    "we assure that the model states have a behavior which is consistent with the so called sheline - sakai scheme @xcite which makes a continuous link between the vibrational and rotational spectra .",
    "these properties are satisfied by the following three sets of projected states : @xmath10}|0\\rangle,\\\\ \\phi_{jm}^{\\beta}(d)&=&n_{j}^{\\beta}p_{m0}^{j}\\omega^{\\dagger}_{\\beta}\\psi_{g},\\,\\,\\,\\,\\omega_{\\beta}^{\\dagger}=\\left(b^{\\dagger}b^{\\dagger}b^{\\dagger}\\right)_{0}+\\frac{3d}{\\sqrt{14}}\\left(b^{\\dagger}b^{\\dagger}\\right)_{0}-\\frac{d^{3}}{\\sqrt{70}},\\\\ \\phi_{jm}^{\\gamma}(d)&=&n_{j}^{\\gamma}p_{m2}^{j}\\omega^{\\dagger}_{\\gamma,2}\\psi_{g},\\,\\,\\,\\,\\omega_{\\gamma , m}^{\\dagger}=\\left(b^{\\dagger}b^{\\dagger}\\right)_{2,m}+d\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{7}}b^{\\dagger}_{m}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] within the restricted space just defined , one constructs an effective hamiltonian by requiring a maximal decoupling , i.e. the off diagonal matrix elements are equal or close to zero .",
    "ideally would be to have a diagonal hamiltonian but this is not possible due to the gamma band .",
    "however , one solution is given by the six order quadrupole boson hamiltonian : @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the quadrupole boson number operator : @xmath13 indeed @xmath14 has the property that its matrix elements between a beta band state and a ground band or a gamma band state are vanishing .",
    "the interaction of the @xmath15-band with the rest of the boson space might be simulated by some additional terms in the model hamiltonian , which do not affect the decoupling feature of the band : @xmath16 thus , the total hamiltonian used by csm for describing the ground , beta and gamma bands has the form : @xmath17 the matrix elements of @xmath18 between the states presented above are expressed in terms of the basic overlap integral @xmath19 and its k - th derivatives , defined by @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the legendre polynomial of rank @xmath22 .",

    "the properties of all these nuclei can be described fairly well by csm . moreover , in this work we present analytical expressions for energies and transition probabilities for vibrational , transitional and well deformed nuclei .",
    "since the analytical formulas are easy to be handled , and by this paper they were positively tested , we may say that the results presented here represent a major achievement of csm .",
    "the present paper consider the csm approach in two extremes of small and large deformations .",
    "thus , the matrix elements of the model hamiltonian as well as of the e2 transition operator between the angular momentum projected states modeling the members of the ground , beta and gamma bands , are alternatively expanded in power series of @xmath95 and @xmath7 . as a result",
    "the excitation energies in the three bands are expressed analytically as ratios of polynomials in @xmath46 and @xmath7 respectively with the coefficients depending on angular momentum . concerning the matrix elements of the e2 transition operator , for small deformation they are , with a few exceptions , linear functions in @xmath6 , the expansion coefficients being rational functions of the angular momentum . in the large deformation regime",

    "changing the nucleus under consideration the coefficients are not changing chaotically but obey a certain rule expressed by their dependence on @xmath122 .",
    "in fact this is a measure of the predictability power of the csm approach . as shown for the gd isotopes csm",
    "describes not only the nuclei corresponding to a certain symmetry but also those corresponding to the transition between them including the critical nucleus .    comparing csm with the liquid drop model ( ldm )",
    ", one may say that csm is a highly anharmonic model while ldm has a harmonic structure .",
    "however as we mentioned before in the large deformation situation the csm wave functions are similar to those characterizing ldm in the strong coupling limit .",
    "another successful anharmonic model was proposed by gneus and greiner but that uses a large number of parameters and moreover the quadrupole conjugate momenta contribute to the hamiltonian only through the quadratic terms",
    ". moreover energies are obtained by diagonalization procedure in a spherical basis which may encounter convergence difficulties for large deformations . by contrast csm projects , over angular momentum , states from a coherent state and two orthogonal polynomial excitations and",
    "consequently is especially realistic for the well deformed nuclei .",
    "this feature is actually confirmed by the application from this paper were the transuranic nuclei spectra are obtained with a high accuracy .",
    "csm accounts for features which are complementary to those described by iba .",
    "indeed csm s model hamiltonian is not a boson number conserving hamiltonian .",
    "moreover while iba uses a space of states with limited number of bosons , csm states covers the whole boson space since they are projected from infinite series of bosons . due to this feature",
    "the iba approach is concerned with the description of low lying states with angular momentum not exceeding @xmath139 and with a moderate deformation . by contrast",
    ", csm works quite well for high spin states ( in fig.3 energies for states with @xmath140 are shown ) .",
    "csm was applied for the description of the triaxial nuclei @xcite and the results were compared with those obtained within the vibration rotation model @xcite . recently",
