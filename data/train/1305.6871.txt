    "there is now a substantial literature on the higher - dimensional extension of einstein s general theory of relativity known as kaluza - klein gravity @xcite .",
    "there are several ways to test the theory , with perhaps the most straightforward involving the motion of test objects in the field of a static , spherically - symmetric mass like the sun or the earth .",
    "birkhoff s theorem in the usual sense does not hold in higher dimensions @xcite , so some question arises about the best choice of metric to describe such a situation .",
    "but the gravitational field of the sun must be close to schwarzschild , by the solar system tests .",
    "also , the non - linearity of einstein s equations requires us to use exact solutions to model the field . in the minimal five - dimensional ( 5d ) case ,",
    "only two such are known : the soliton @xcite and canonical solutions @xcite .",
    "both satisfy the vacuum field equations in 5d , consistent with the spirit of kaluza s original idea that 4d matter and gauge fields appear as a manifestation of pure geometry in the higher - dimensional world .",
    "the soliton metric contains no explicit @xmath0-dependence and reduces to the standard 4d schwarzschild solution on hypersurfaces @xmath1  const .",
    "the canonical metric contains explicit @xmath0-dependence ; but its effects are suppressed by a quadratic prefactor @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a constant and presumably a large length scale ( a free parameter of the theory ) . the fifth dimension in this solution is flat .",
    "the classical tests of general relativity were first applied to the soliton by kalligas et al . and lim et al . in 1995",
    "@xcite , and again in more generality by liu and overduin in 2000 @xcite .",
    "light deflection , perihelion precession of mercury , and radar ranging to mars set limits of order @xmath4 on the primary free parameter of the metric , and the hope was expressed that data on geodetic precession for spinning test masses from gravity probe  b might push this down to as little as @xmath5 .",
    "overduin then used observational constraints on violations of the equivalence principle to obtain bounds of order @xmath6 on the soliton metric as applied to the sun , earth , moon and jupiter @xcite .",
    "if the soliton metric were the only choice available , such a result might call the need for a higher - dimensional extension of general relativity into question , contrary to what is suggested by most attempts to unify gravitation with the other fundamental interactions .",
    "however , analysis of the canonical metric by mashhoon , wesson and liu @xcite has revealed that for this solution , the classical tests are satisfied _ exactly _ for non - spinning test bodies .",
    "this is due to the flatness of the extra dimension and the quadratic prefactor on the 4d part of the metric and can be proven using a 1926 theorem on embedding by campbell ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for discussion .",
    "spin thus emerges as a potentially critical discriminator between standard and higher - dimensional extensions of general relativity , and the canonical solution may be the most appropriate for this problem . the geodetic effect for the canonical metric was first worked out by liu and wesson in 1996 @xcite .",
    "we return to this work and assess the status of the theory using the recently released final results from gravity probe  b ( henceforth gpb @xcite ) . the geodetic effect is briefly reviewed in section  2 .",
    "we consider the soliton metric in section  3 and the canonical metric in section  4 .",
    "our results are summarized and discussed in section  5 .",
    "the geodetic effect is the first test of general relativity to involve the spin of the test body ( the other being the frame - dragging or lense - thirring effect ) and was originally investigated by willem de  sitter in 1916 using the orbital angular momentum of the earth - moon system as a `` gyroscope '' in the field of the sun ( this is now termed the `` solar geodetic '' or de  sitter effect and was also observed by gpb @xcite ) .",
    "de  sitter s calculations were extended to include spin angular momentum of rotating test bodies such as the earth by jan schouten in 1918 and adriaan fokker in 1920 .",
    "thorne @xcite has shown how the effect may be thought of as arising from two separate contributions : one due to space curvature around the central mass and the other a spin - orbit coupling between the spin of the gyroscope and the `` mass current '' of the central mass ( in the rest frame of the orbiting gyroscope ) .",
    "the space curvature effect is twice as large as the spin - orbit one .",
    "it arises because the gyroscope s angular momentum vector , orthogonal to the plane of the motion , no longer lines up with itself after one complete circuit through curved spacetime around the central mass ( fig .",
    "[ fig : missinginch ] ) .",
    "the spin - orbit contribution is analogous to thomas precession in classical electromagnetism ( where the electron experiences an induced magnetic field due to the motion of the nucleus relative to its own rest frame ) .",
    "both contributions together produce what is known as the geodetic effect within general relativity , causing the gyroscope s spin axis to precess by a predicted 6606  milliarcseconds ( mas ) per year in the north - south direction for a polar orbit at gpb s altitude of 642  km @xcite .    to treat this problem in extended theories of gravity ,",
    "one begins with an appropriate choice of metric and solves the equations of motion for the velocity ( geodesic equation ) and angular momentum ( parallel transport equation ) of the test body , assuming that the two vectors are orthogonal .",
    "the geodetic effect is the excess of the test body s spin angular velocity over its orbital angular velocity .",
    "our notation follows that in refs .",
    "@xcite except that we restore physical units and label the extra coordinate @xmath7 .",
    "lowercase greek indices @xmath8 run over @xmath9 as usual while uppercase latin indices @xmath10 run over all five indices @xmath11 .",
    "proper distance in 5d ( @xmath12 ) is related to its 4d counterpart ( @xmath13 ) by @xmath14 so that @xmath15 .",
    "the line element for the soliton reads ( following ref .",
    "@xcite but switching to non - isotropic form and defining @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) : @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the gravitational or tolman - whittaker mass of the soliton at @xmath23 , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are free parameters related by a consistency relationship @xmath26 that follows from the field equations .",
    "we take @xmath25 as the primary free parameter of the theory in what follows , noting that the 4d schwarzschild metric is recovered on hypersurfaces @xmath1  const in the limit @xmath27 ( and @xmath28 ) .",
    "the consistency relation imposes an upper limit of @xmath29 .",
    "the 4d induced matter associated with this solution has a density proportional to @xmath30 @xcite , into @xmath31- , @xmath32- and @xmath33-components . requiring that the 4d field equations take their usual form , @xmath34 , one obtains an expression for the energy - momentum tensor @xmath35 of an induced 4d matter fluid that is a manifestation of pure geometry in 5d .",
    "] so @xmath24 and @xmath25 must have opposite signs .",
    "thus we are restricted _ a priori _ to values of @xmath25 in the range @xmath36 .",
    "the motion of a spinning test body with velocity @xmath37 and angular momentum @xmath38 is governed by three central equations ; namely , the geodesic equation @xmath39 the parallel transport equation @xmath40 and the orthogonality condition @xmath41 these equations can be solved analytically without placing any restrictions on the components of @xmath42 if the orbit is taken to be circular ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) @xcite . in the weak - field limit ( i.e.",
    ", dropping terms of second and higher order in @xmath45 ) the spatial part of @xmath42 is found to precess with an angular speed @xmath46 \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the distance between the test body ( gyroscope ) and the central mass ( earth ) . in @xcite ) associated with momentum along the extra dimension .",
    "this has the effect of `` switching off '' the @xmath48-component for the soliton metric and might be worth revisiting in future work . ]",
    "the geodetic effect is the excess of @xmath49 over the test body s _ orbital _ angular speed @xmath50 , which is found in the same limit to be @xmath51 \\ ; .\\ ] ] the accumulated geodetic precession angle per orbit , @xmath52 , is thus given to leading order by @xcite @xmath53 where the term in front of the parentheses on the left - hand side is the standard expression for geodetic precession in 4d gr , and @xmath54 is the predicted departure in 5d theory ( in the last step , we have applied the above - noted consistency relation between @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) . because the free parameter @xmath25 is restricted to negative values , kaluza - klein gravity with the soliton metric",
    "can only accommodate precession rates _ less than _ those predicted by 4d gr .",
    "this is a common feature of most attempts to extend einstein s theory with additional degrees of freedom , whether in the guise of extra dimensions or new scalar fields .",
    "physically , this is consistent with the expectation that allowing the spin vector to wander into new regions of dynamical phase space can only reduce ( not increase ) the amount of precession that is observable in 4d . a conclusive experimental determination that @xmath55 might therefore be the basis for ruling out the theory .",
    "the gpb final results and implications for @xmath56 and @xmath25 are presented and discussed in table  1 ( section  [ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "the line element for the canonical metric reads @xcite : @xmath57 -d\\ell^2 \\ ; , \\label{eq : canonicalmetric}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 and @xmath3 is a constant length scale , perhaps related to the cosmological constant via @xmath59 . as before , the equations of motions ( [ eq : geodesic]-[eq : orthogonal ] )",
    "can be solved analytically without placing any restrictions on @xmath60 if we assume a circular orbit ( @xmath61 and model the gpb situation by placing the spin vector in the orbital plane , @xmath62 with @xmath63 ( due to the choice of coordinates @xmath64 and @xmath48 are dimensionless while @xmath65 and @xmath66 have dimensions of inverse length ) .    carrying out this procedure in the same way as for the soliton metric",
    ", the spin angular velocity is found as @xmath67 comparing to the orbital angular velocity , and using the metric to relate 5d and 4d proper distance , one finds @xcite that the geodetic precession angle per orbit is again approximated in the weak - field limit ( @xmath68 ) by eq .",
    "( [ eq : precession ] ) , but now with @xmath69 where @xmath70 $ ] is a dimensionless combination of the normalized amplitudes of the spin vector @xmath71 $ ] as well as the length scale @xmath3 and two fiducial values of the 4d proper distance .",
    "we do not have definitive values for all these parameters , but there are two clear routes to testing the theory .",
    "first , we can adopt the natural assumption that @xmath3 is in fact related to the cosmological constant by @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "in observational cosmology it is usual to express @xmath73 in terms of the normalized dark - energy density @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "when this is done , we can use experimental constraints on @xmath56 to put an upper limit on the value of @xmath77 : @xmath78 since @xmath77 is a dimensionless combination of a @xmath79 term and a ratio of spin components , we expect it to have a positive value not too far from unity",
    ".    alternatively , we can _ assume _ that @xmath77 is of order unity on naturalness grounds , and use the same relationship plus experimental constraints on @xmath56 to put a _ lower",
    "_ limit on the value of the length scale @xmath3 : @xmath80 again , we would expect that @xmath3 corresponds to a large distance , since the metric  ( [ eq : canonicalmetric ] ) deviates from 4d schwarzschild by terms of order @xmath81 .",
    "its sign must also be positive ( since it is a distance ) .",
    "constraints on @xmath56 from gpb and implications for @xmath82 and @xmath3 are presented in table  [ table : results ] , where    llllll gyro & @xmath83 ( mas / yr ) @xcite & @xmath84 & @xmath85 & @xmath86 & @xmath87 ( pc ) + 1 & @xmath88 & @xmath89 & @xmath90 & @xmath91 & 32 + 2 & @xmath92 & @xmath93 & n / a & n / a & n / a + 3 & @xmath94 & @xmath95 & @xmath96 & @xmath97 & 41 + 4 & @xmath98 & @xmath99 & @xmath100 & @xmath91 & 31 + joint & @xmath101 & @xmath102 & @xmath103 & @xmath104 & 71 +    @xmath105 , @xmath83 is the measured north - south relativistic drift rate ( with 1@xmath106 reported uncertainties ) and @xmath107  mas / yr is the general relativity prediction for geodetic precession given the actual gpb orbit @xcite .",
    "we use @xmath108  km @xcite together with recent measurements of the hubble parameter @xmath109  km  s@xmath110  mpc@xmath110 @xcite and normalized dark - energy density @xmath111 from high - redshift supernovae @xcite and the cosmic microwave background @xcite .",
    "our limits in each case come from the largest allowed _ negative _ values of @xmath56 in column  3 of table  1 .",
    "these limits are consistent with pre - gpb expectations for both the soliton @xcite and canonical metrics @xcite . for example , using the joint confidence region for all four gyros and assuming that @xmath72 for the canonical metric , we find that @xmath112 , implying that the component of test - body angular momentum along the @xmath0-direction could be significantly larger than that along @xmath113 ( modulo a @xmath79-term ) .",
    "if instead we assume that @xmath114 then @xmath115  pc .",
    "these limits are complementary to somewhat stronger ones that can be obtained ( with some additional assumptions ) from cosmological tests , especially the magnitude - redshift relation for distant supernovae @xcite .",
    "however , what is remarkable here is that there should be any sensitivity at all to cosmological parameters such as @xmath3 or @xmath73 in an experiment involving the motions of macroscopic test bodies in low - earth orbit ( this appears to be unique to the canonical solution with its @xmath2 prefactor on the 4d part of the metric . ) similarly , our constraints for the soliton metric are complementary to stronger ones that can be placed on @xmath25 for various solar - system bodies ( including the earth ) using observational limits on violations of the equivalence principle @xcite .",
    "the complementarity is nicely illustrated by the case of gyro  2 , whose experimental range of uncertainty encompasses only positive values for @xmath56 ( i.e. , geodetic precession rates greater than that predicted by gr ) .",
    "if this result had been confirmed by all four gyros , then the 5d theory would have been excluded using _ either _ choice of metric . in the event , it is thought that gyro  2 suffered from larger systematic effects than the others @xcite , and kaluza - klein gravity remains a viable extension of 4d general relativity .    the question is sometimes raised whether tests like this can ever conclusively establish the existence or non - existence of extra dimensions .",
    "similar questions could perhaps be raised about other extrapolations from the current standard model .",
    "the best approach is to apply as many independent tests as possible and look for an accumulation of evidence that points to the same region of parameter space in the theory .",
    "kaluza - klein solitons have unique density profiles and other properties that make them viable dark - matter candidates @xcite , with theoretical arguments suggesting values of @xmath116 in the solar system and @xmath117 as large as @xmath118 in galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "if two or more independent tests ( such as gravitational lensing ) were to converge on a nonzero value of @xmath25 for the same system , it would not _ prove _ the existence of extra dimensions ",
    "one might look for scalar - field or other theories that could accommodate the same phenomena  but it would be a strong _ prima facie _ case .",
    "moreover the example of the canonical metric shows that it is prudent to keep an open mind even in the case of a null result . with that metric no departure from 4d gr is expected for the classical tests ; the effects of the extra dimension manifest themselves only for spinning test bodies .",
    "more than anything else , these remarks highlight the need for new solutions of the field equations in @xmath119 , and for a generalization of birkhoff s theorem that could be used to discriminate between them in a compelling way .",
    "future work can build on these results in several ways .",
    "it would be of interest to test the predictions of kaluza - klein gravity for frame - dragging as well as geodetic precession .",
    "the case @xmath120 for the soliton metric deserves further study . it may be possible to obtain stronger constraints for the canonical metric using violations of the equivalence principle @xcite .",
    "following the lead of matsuno and ishihara @xcite , it might also be useful to investigate precession effects for other 5d soliton - like solutions incorporating time - dependence @xcite , additional @xmath0-dependence @xcite and electric charge @xcite .",
    "finally , methods similar to those employed here can also be used to test other generalizations of 4d gr , like those that violate lorentz invariance @xcite .",
