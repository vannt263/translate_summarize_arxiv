    "even though for over 30 years qcd has been thought to be the theory of strong interactions , it has had a rather limited impact on most other branches of physics  except for few - quark hadron physics .",
    "of course , the reason is well known  to write down the lagrangian that describes _ exactly _ the quark and gluon interactions is easy , but actually performing calculations _ directly _ with this lagrangian has turned out to be extremely difficult .",
    "the one exception to this last statement is at high energies , where  due to asymptotic freedom  the interactions become sufficiently weak for perturbation theory to be applicable and this has had much success @xcite .",
    "however , most of  everyday \" physics is far from this limit .",
    "furthermore , some quantities such as masses depend on the interaction strength @xmath0 as @xmath1 , which immediately rules out a perturbation expansion in powers of @xmath0 .",
    "this inability to treat the qcd lagrangian directly has led to several different types of approximation being made .",
    "essentially these fall into broad categories : the numerical and the effective theory approaches .",
    "unfortunately , the latter  especially the effective potential theories ( epts ) , which are the main subject of this chapter  often have little overlap with the numerical approaches . those approaches that use the direct numerical way concentrate mainly on the description of single mesons or baryons",
    "_ i.e. _ @xmath2 or @xmath3 states , whereas most of the epts tend to concentrate more on multiquark systems .",
    "however , even though these epts are often advertized as being  qcd motivated \" , in most cases they are simply based on many - body ideas and techniques that are well founded in nuclear physics  but are not necessarily justified for the description of multiquark states . the main purpose of this chapter is to see to what extent these  nuclear physics motivated \" methods are justified . but",
    "first a few general words should be said about these two approaches .",
    "the numerical treatment of the qcd lagrangian  lattice qcd  has been the main subject of this volume and so , to avoid too much repetition , only points relevant to this chapter will be mentioned . in lattice",
    "qcd the original exact lagrangian is replaced by an approximate form that is discretized on a 4-dimensional lattice with links of length @xmath4 .",
    "this discretization can be done in many ways , but in all cases the original qcd lagrangian must be recovered as @xmath5 .",
    "the discretization also reduces the subject to being mainly numerical .",
    "however , as emphasized by lscher  @xcite : `` in general , numerical simulations have the reputation of being an approximate method that mainly serves to obtain qualitative information on the behaviour of complex systems .",
    "this is , however , not so in lattice qcd , where the simulations produce results that are exact ( on a given lattice ) up to statistical errors .",
    "the systematic uncertainties related to the non - zero lattice spacing and the finite lattice volume then still need to be investigated , but these effects are theoretically well understood and can usually be brought under control . ''",
    "therefore , in order to recover results that are appropriate to the original continuum lagrangian , two main limits need to be studied :    * * limit 1 .",
    "are the results stable as @xmath6 ? * + of course , this limit must be approached with consideration of the number of spatial sites in the lattice @xmath7 , since the volume @xmath8 of the system being studied , _ e.g. _",
    "2- , 3- or 4-quarks , should be much smaller than the physical lattice size @xmath9 . furthermore , the euclidean time",
    " needed to extract observables  should be much greater than @xmath10 . in practice",
    ", usually @xmath11 suffices .",
    "therefore , the two inequalities that need to be satisfied can be combined as this can instantly lead to problems for a meson  meson system ( @xmath12 ) with mesons of size @xmath13 fm , since this would need @xmath14  fm , if the gradual separation of the mesons is of interest . in this case",
    ", a lattice spacing of @xmath15 fm would require @xmath16 and so @xmath17 .",
    "such large lattices are used by some groups _ e.g. _ @xmath18 in the study of scattering lengths in ref .",
    "@xcite  with even larger lattices @xmath19 now becoming feasible  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the progress in computer technology allows the lattice extents to be doubled in all directions roughly every 8 years  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , at present many of us have to be satisfied with sizes more like @xmath20 , which rules out the study of completely separated mesons .",
    "one way of partially overcoming this problem is to use so called improved actions .",
    "these incorporate modifications to the standard lattice lagrangian in order to remove the lowest order dependences on @xmath4 .",
    "this enables coarser lattices to be used , so that , in some cases , @xmath21 fm suffices compared with more usual values of  see refs .",
    "@xcite . in this way",
    ", the inequality @xmath22 is satisfied by increasing @xmath4 and not @xmath23 .",
    "of course , there is often a price to pay . since improved actions are more complicated",
    ", they take more computer time to implement compared with the standard actions .",
    "sometimes this is sufficient to remove the advantage of using a smaller lattice .",
    "having said that , there are some improved actions that seem to be always advantageous .",
    "probably the most common of these is the so - called clover action for improving the quark part of the qcd lagrangian @xcite  see subsec .",

    "+ often the @xmath24 limit is checked in three steps : * * \\i ) first a * benchmark calculation * is performed with , say , a lattice @xmath20 and @xmath25 fm .",

    "this is much more time and storage consuming by a factor of about 4 , but will show whether or not the process being treated  fits \" into the lattice .",
    "it is concluded that the finite size effect is no problem , if these latter results are directly the same , within error bars , as the benchmark results . * * \\iii ) finally , the calculation is repeated with the above larger lattice but using , say , @xmath28 fm and the results compared with the above by now including appropriate factors of @xmath29 .",

    "this raises the question : given a fixed number of  computer units \" for a calculation , then what is the most efficient way of spending these units ?",
    "as pointed out by kronfeld  @xcite , it is much more efficient to run at several lattice spacings than to put all the resources onto the finest conceivable lattice .",
    "kronfeld gives the example of a computer budget of 100 units and suggests using 65 , 25 and 10 units on a series of coarser lattices with spacings @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the time needed to create statistically independent lattice gauge fields grows as @xmath33 , where the 4 in the exponent arises because the number of variables to process grows as @xmath34 in a 3 + 1 dimensional world and @xmath35 depending on the algorithm for updating the lattice . in this case",
    "the three sets of lattices would have comparable error bars that would only be slightly larger  by a factor of about 1.25 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath36 )  than the case of using all 100 units on the finest lattice with @xmath30 .",
    "however , using all three sets enables an estimate to be made of the discretization effect . as kronfeld says ",

    "the reason why the one - gluon exchange becomes ineffective with light quarks is because the use of minimal relativity  in , say , the blankenbecler - sugar equation for describing the @xmath107 interaction  introduces relativistic square root factors . indeed , if both quarks are light , then the effective one - gluon interaction is essentially flat and very weak for short distances .",
    "since this damping of one - gluon exchange also enters in meson spectra , another mechanism is needed for the necessary short range attraction . a possible candidate for this",
