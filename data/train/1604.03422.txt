    "<S> we investigate the dynamical stabilities of these four materials by considering the phonon dispersions . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained electronic structures reveal the direct band gap of monolayer @xmath2as / sb and indirect band gap of @xmath3as / sb . </S>",
    "<S> significant absorption is observed in @xmath2sb , which can be used as a broad saturable absorber . </S>"
