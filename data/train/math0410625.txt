    "+ the mcm modules over the hypersurface @xmath11 were described in @xcite as @xmath12parameter families indexed by the points of the curve @xmath13 .",
    "this description is mainly based on the atiyah s theory of the vector bundles classification over elliptic curves , in particular over @xmath14 and on difficult computations made with the computer algebra system singular .",
    "the description depends on two discrete invariants  the rank and the degree of the bundle  and on a continuous invariant  the points of the curve @xmath15 .",
    "+ it is of high interest the classification of vector bundles , in particular of acm bundles ( i.e. those which corresponds to mcm modules ) over the singularities of higher dimension . in the paper @xcite are described the matrix factorizations which define the graded mcm modules of rank one over @xmath16 .",
    "there is a finite number of such modules which correspond to @xmath17 lines , @xmath17 pencils of quadrics and @xmath18 nets of twisted cubic curves lying on the surface @xmath19 . from geometrical point of view",
    "the problem is easy , but the effective description of the matrix factorizations is difficult and singular has been intensively used .",
    "+ in the present paper we continue this study for the graded mcm modules of rank two .",
    "we obtain a general description of the mcm orientable modules of rank two .",
    "they are given by skew ",
    "symmetric matrix factorizations ( see theorem [ thm2.1 ] ) .",
    "the technique is based on the results of herzog and khl ( see @xcite ) concerning the so called _ bourbaki exact sequences_. the matrix factorizations of the graded , orientable , rank two , @xmath20generated mcm modules are parameter families indexed by the points of the surface @xmath21 , that is two parameter families and some finite ones in bijection with rank one mcm modules described in @xcite ( see theorem [ thm3.2 ] , here",
    "an important fact is that two gorenstein ideals of codimension @xmath5 define the same mcm module via the associated bourbaki sequence if and only if they belong to the same even linkage class ) .",
    "we also describe the non  orientable mcm modules of rank two over @xmath22 .",
    "there is a finite number of such modules which correspond somehow to the rank one modules described in @xcite .",

    "this result has been essential in the description of the graded , non  orientable mcm modules .",
    "the paper highlights bijections between the classes of indecomposable , graded , non  orientable mcm modules of rank two , @xmath20 and @xmath31generated and the classes of rank one , graded , mcm modules ( see theorem [ prop4.6 ] and theorem [ thm5.3 ] ) .",
    "consequently , there exists a bijection between the classes of indecomposable , graded , non  orientable mcm modules of rank three , @xmath31generated and the classes of rank one , graded , mcm modules ( see corollary [ cor5.4 ] ) .",
    "these results remind us the theory of atiyah and give a small hope that the non - orientable case behaves in the same way for higher rank .",
    "we also show that there are no indecomposable , graded , non  orientable mcm modules of rank two @xmath32generated .",
    "consequently , there exist no indecomposable , graded , non  orientable mcm modules of rank four , 6-generated .",
    "till now the description of graded rank two mcm modules is not too far from the theory of atiyah .",
    "but the description of graded , rank two , 6-generated mcm modules is different ( see section 6 ) as we expected since a part of them given by gorenstein ideals defined by 5 general points on @xmath21 forms a 5-parameter family ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however we believe that behind these results there exists a nice theory of graded mcm modules over a cubic hypersurface in four variables which waits to be discovered .",
