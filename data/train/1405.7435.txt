    "understanding the origin and evolution of disc galaxies is one of the major goals of modern astronomy .",
    "the disc is a prominent feature of late type galaxies like the milky way .",
    "as compared to distant galaxies , for which one can only measure the gross properties , the milky way offers the opportunity to study the disc in great detail . for the milky way",
    ", we can determine 6-dimensional phase space information , combined with photometric and stellar parameters , for a huge sample of stars .",
    "this has led to large observational programs to catalog the stars in the milky way in order to compare them with theoretical models .",
    "the milky way stellar system is broadly composed of four distinct parts although in reality there is likely to be considerable overlap between them : the thin disc , the thick disc , the stellar halo and the bulge . in this paper ,",
    "we mainly concentrate on understanding the disc components which are the dominant stellar populations .    in the milky way ,",
    "the thick disc was originally identified as the second exponential required to fit vertical star counts @xcite .",
    "thick discs are also ubiquitous features of late type galaxies @xcite .",
    "but whether the thick disc is a separate component with a distinct formation mechanism is highly debatable and a difficult question to answer .    since the @xcite result",
    ", various attempts have been made to characterize the thick disc .",
    "some studies suggest that thick disc stars have distinct properties : they are old and metal poor @xcite and @xmath6 enhanced .",
    "@xcite fit the sdss star counts using a two - component model and find that the thick disc has a larger scale - length than the thin disc .",
    "in contrast , @xcite using a much smaller sample of sdss and segue stars find the opposite when they associate the thick disc with the @xmath6-enhanced component .",
    "finally , the idea of a separate thick disc has recently been challenged .",
    "@xcite argued that chemical evolutionary models with radial migration and mixing can replicate the properties of the thick disc ( see also * ? ? ? * who explore radial mixing using n - body simulations ) .",
    "@xcite do not find the expected separation between metallicity and kinematics for f , g stars in the sdss survey , and @xcite argue that the thick disc is a smooth continuation of the thin disc",
    ".    opinions regarding the formation of a thick disc are equally divided .",
    "various mechanisms have been proposed : accretion of stars from disrupted galaxies @xcite , heating of discs by minor mergers , radial migration of stars @xcite , a gas - rich merger at high redshift @xcite , and gravitationally unstable disc evolution @xcite , inter alia .",
    "recently , @xcite have suggested that the thick disc can form without secular heating , mainly because stars forming at higher redshift had a higher velocity dispersion .",
    "another possibility , proposed by @xcite , is misaligned angular momentum of in - falling gas .",
    "how the angular momentum of halo gas becomes misaligned is described in @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite suggest that misaligned gas can destroy the discs .    the obvious way to test the different thick disc theories is to compare the kinematic and chemical abundance distributions of the thick disc stars with those of different models . since , the thin and thick disc stars strongly overlap in both space and kinematics , it is difficult to separate them using just position and velocity . to really isolate and study the thick disc , one needs a tag that stays with a star throughout its life .",
    "age is a possible tag but it is difficult to get reliable age estimates of stars .",
    "chemical composition is another promising tag that can be used , but this requires high resolution spectroscopy of a large number of stars . in the near future , surveys such as galah using the hermes spectrograph @xcite and the gaia  eso survey using the flames spectrograph @xcite should be able to fill this void . in our first analysis , we restrict ourselves to a differential kinematic study of the disc components .",
    "we plan to treat the more difficult problem of chemo - dynamics in future .",
    "the simplest way to describe the kinematics of the milky way stars of the solar neighborhood is by assuming gaussian velocity distributions with some pre - determined orientation of the principal axes of the velocity ellipsoid .",
    "then if a single component disc is used , only three components of velocity dispersion and the mean azimuthal velocity @xmath7 need be known .",
    "if a thick disc is included , one requires five additional parameters , one of them being the fraction of stars in the thick disc .",
    "if stars are sampled from an extended volume and not just the solar neighborhood , then one needs to specify the radial dependence of the dispersions .",
    "the velocity dispersion of a disc stellar population is known to increase with age , so one has to adopt an age velocity - dispersion relation .",
    "discs heat because a cold , thin disc occupies a very small fraction of phase space , and fluctuations in the gravitational field cause stars to diffuse through phase space to regions of lower phase - space density .",
    "the fluctuations arise from several sources , including giant molecular clouds , spiral arms , a rotating bar , and halo objects that come close to the disc .",
    "one approach to computing the consequences of these processes is n - body simulation , but stellar discs are notoriously tricky to simulate accurately , with the consequence that reliable simulations are computationally costly .",
    "in particular , they are too costly for it to be feasible to find a simulation that provides a good fit to a significant body of observational data . instead we characterize the properties of the milky way disc by fitting a suitable analytical formula .",
    "the formula summarizes large amounts of data but its usefulness extends beyond this .",
    "the formula is traditionally taken to be a power law in age .",
    "the exponents @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 of these power laws may not be the same for all three components .",
    "the ratio @xmath11 and the values of @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are useful for understanding the physical processes responsible for heating the disc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the first generation of stellar population models characterized the density distribution of stars using photometric surveys .",
    "@xcite assumed an exponential disc with magnitude - dependent scale heights .",
    "an evolutionary model using population synthesis techniques was presented by . given a star formation rate ( sfr ) and an initial mass function ( imf ) , one calculates the resulting stellar populations using theoretical evolutionary tracks .",
    "the important step forward was that the properties of the disc , like scale height , density laws and velocity dispersions , were assumed to be a function of age rather than being color - magnitude dependent terms . later introduced dynamical self - consistency to link disc scale and vertical velocity dispersions via the gravitational potential . further improved the constraints on sfr and imf of the disc .",
    "the present state of the art is described in and is known as the besanon model . here , the disc is constructed from a set of isothermal populations that are assumed to be in equilibrium .",
    "analytic functions for the density distribution , age / metallicity relation and imf are provided for each population .",
    "a similar scheme is also used by the codes trilegal and _ galaxia _ @xcite .",
    "there is a crucial distinction between kinematic and dynamical models . in a kinematic model ,",
    "one specifies the stellar motions independently at each spatial location , and the gravitational field in which the stars move plays no role . in a dynamical model , the spatial density distribution of stars and their kinematics are self - consistently linked by the potential , under the assumption that the system is in steady state .",
    "if one has expressions for three constants of stellar motion as functions of position and velocity , dynamical models are readily constructed via jeans theorem .",
    "@xcite provides an algorithm for evaluating approximate action integrals , and has used these to fit dynamical models to the gcs data @xcite .",
    "@xcite have confronted the predictions of the best of these models with rave data and shown that the model is remarkably , but not perfectly , successful .",
    "our approach is different in two key respects : we fit kinematic rather than dynamical models , and we avoid adopting distances to , or using proper motions of , rave stars .",
    "large photometric surveys such as denis , 2mass @xcite and sdss @xcite provide the underpinning for all galaxy modelling efforts .",
    "the sdss survey has been used to provide an empirical model of the milky way stars @xcite .",
    "the besanon model was fitted to the 2mass star counts , and its photometric parameters have been more thoroughly tested than its kinematic parameters because kinematic data for a large number of stars was not available when the model was constructed ,    the hipparcos satellite and the ucac2 catalog @xcite provided proper motions and parallaxes for @xmath12 stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "@xcite used the hipparcos data to study stellar kinematics as a function of color .",
    "they also determined the solar motion with respect to the lsr and the axial ratios of the velocity ellipsoid .",
    "@xcite also using hipparcos stars found the velocity dispersion to vary with function of age as @xmath13 . more recently ,",
    "@xcite using data from a new reduction of the hipparcos mission estimated the solar motion and the avr for all three velocity components .",
    "the avr is assumed to be a power law with exponents @xmath14 and @xmath10 for the three velocity components in the galactocentric cylindrical coordinate system .",
    "they found @xmath15 .",
    "they also investigated the star formation rate ( sfr ) and found it to be declining from past to present .",
    "however , a degeneracy exists between the sfr and the slope of the imf , and constraining both of them together is challenging .",
    "the gcs survey combined the hipparcos and tycho-2 proper motions with radial velocity measurements and strmgren photometry to create a kinematically unbiased sample of 16682 f and g stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "the data contains full 6d phase space information along with estimates of ages .",
    "the temperature , metallicity and ages were further improved by and distances and kinematics were improved by using revised hipparcos parallaxes .",
    "they investigated the avr and found @xmath16 which are at odds with @xcite . used the infrared flux method to improve the temperature , metallicity and age estimates for the gcs survey .",
    "the uncertainty in estimated ages is an ongoing concern for studies that attempt to derive the avr directly from the gcs data .    with the advent of large spectroscopic surveys",
    "like rave @xcite and sdss / segue @xcite , we now have the radial velocity and stellar parameters for a large number of stars to beyond the solar neighborhood .",
    "@xcite used sdss / segue to fit the spatial distributions of mono - abundance populations by double exponentials .",
    "they showed that the vertical velocity dispersion declines exponentially with radius but varies little in @xmath17 .",
    "finally , they argue that the thick disc is a continuation of the thin disc rather than a separate entity .    the rave survey has also been used to study the stellar kinematics of the milky way disc . study the velocity dispersion and mean motion of the thin and thick disc stars in the @xmath18 plane .",
    "they use the technique of singular value decomposition to compute the moments of the velocity distribution .",
    "their analysis clearly shows that velocity dispersions fall as a function of distance from the galactic center .",
    "@xcite explored the kinematics using red clump stars from rave and found complex structures in velocity space .",
    "a detailed comparison with the prediction from the code _ galaxia _ was done , taking the selection function of rave into account .",
    "the trend of dispersions in the @xmath18 plane showed a good match with the model .",
    "however , the mean velocities showed significant differences .",
    "studied the relation between kinematics and the chemical abundances of stars . by computing stellar orbits they deduced the maximum vertical distance @xmath19 and eccentricity @xmath20 of stars .",
    "next they studied the chemical properties of stars by binning them in the @xmath21 plane .",
    "they found that stars with @xmath22kpc and @xmath23 have two populations with distinct chemical properties , which hints at radial migration .",
    "@xcite used full six - dimensional information for rave stars to fit a gaussian model to velocities in the @xmath24 plane .",
    "they studied how the orientation and shape of the velocity ellipsoid varies with location in the galaxy , and provided analytic fits to the highly non - gaussian distributions of @xmath25 .",
    "they also compared the observed kinematics of stars in different spatial bins with the predictions of a full dynamical model that had been fitted to the gcs data .",
    "stellar kinematics allow us to measure the peculiar motion ( @xmath26 ) of the sun with respect to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) , and also the speed of the lsr ( in other words , the circular speed at the location of sun , @xmath27 ) .",
    "there have been as many determinations of these as there have been new data , one of the earliest being ( @xmath28 km s@xmath29 by @xcite .",
    "very precise measurements of these have been extracted from the hipparcos proper motions and the geneva copenhagen survey . @xcite and @xcite , using hipparcos proper motions , got ( @xmath30 km s@xmath29 .",
    "a revision of @xmath4 was suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "later @xcite explained why the previous estimates , which used colors as a proxy for age , gave incorrect results . using a chemo - dynamical model calibrated on gcs data , they found ( @xmath31 km s@xmath29 .",
    "@xcite described a model - independent method and suggests that @xmath32 could be as high as @xmath33 .",
    "as further evidence of an unsettled situation , @xcite find from a sample of 3500 apogee stars @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 km s@xmath29 and also suggest a revision of the lsr reference frame .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this paper , we have constrained the kinematic parameters of the milky way disc using stars from the rave and the gcs surveys . to constrain kinematic parameters , we use analytic kinematic models based on the gaussian and shu distribution functions .",
    "we use these distribution functions , padova stellar tracks and the selection functions of the surveys to predict the likelihood of each observed star . for gcs data , which has full phase - space information for the stars ,",
    "we compute the likelihood in @xmath37 phase space . for rave data , we choose to fit the likelihood in @xmath38 space to avoid use of uncertain distances and proper motions .",
    "we explored the full posterior distribution of model parameters using the markov chain monte carlo technique .",
    "the parameters constrained include the solar peculiar motion ( @xmath26 ) , the circular speed at the sun @xmath3 , a parameter @xmath39 that controls the vertical gradient of @xmath40 , the age velocity dispersion relations ( via @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) , and the scale lengths on which the dispersions vary , @xmath44 and @xmath45 . our results for both rave and gcs data are summarized in tables [ tab : tbgauss ] and [ tab : tbshu ] .",
    "the final best fit model is given in .",
    "in our kinematic modelling the main assumption we make is that we assume a sfr , imf and density laws that describe the spatial distribution of stars in accordance with the besanon model of , but with slight modifications as described in @xcite .",
    "so the kinematic results that we present are conditional upon the above assumption .",
    "moreover , kinematic models offer greater freedom than physics really allows .",
    "so the accuracy of our kinematic results depends upon our ability to supply functional forms which are a good approximation to the actual velocity distribution . to overcome these concerns",
    ", one should fit both the kinematics and the spatial distribution of stars together and they should be dynamically linked via the potential in which the stars move",
    ".    one could in principle constrain model parameters using the two surveys , rave and gcs , simultaneously . however , the two surveys probe different volumes , and it is not clear that a single value of a given parameter , for example the solar motion @xmath46 , is appropriate for both volumes : the immediate vicinity of the sun may be moving with respect to the wider disc , for example .",
    "if such systematic differences exist , the simple models we are fitting can not provide an adequate account of the entire body of data , and parameter values obtained from a joint fit will be of doubtful physical significance .",
    "hence , in this paper , we first analyzed the surveys separately and tried to understand the systematics .",
    "then , having understood the extent to which each survey constrained each parameter , we fixed values of some parameters from the results of one survey while analysing the other .",
    "we do this only for those parameters which we believe should take the same values for both surveys .",
    "the gaussian model proves to be unsuitable for estimating disc parameters such as @xmath44 and @xmath4 because the fits prove to be strongly degenerate .",
    "the gaussian model gives different values of @xmath44 for rave and gcs .",
    "for rave it predicts negative values , implying that @xmath47 increases outwards .",
    "this result is inconsistent with the disc s scale height and value of @xmath11 being constant .",
    "negative values of @xmath44 also disagree with the findings of @xcite .",
    "the shu model has three fewer parameters than the gaussian model and this helps it to break the degeneracy between @xmath44 and @xmath4 .",
    "it gives positive and consistent values for @xmath44 for both rave and gcs .",
    "the shu model also fits the rave data better than the gaussian model , especially with regard to stars values of @xmath25 .",
    "the rave data allow us to constrain the solar peculiar motion and the local circular speed quite precisely .",
    "our @xmath32 and @xmath48 are in good agreement with the results of @xcite , but our @xmath4 is lower by 5 km s@xmath29 .",
    "the rave @xmath32 and @xmath48 are within 2-@xmath49 range of gcs values , but @xmath4 is lower by @xmath50 . using @xmath51 kpc and assuming @xmath52 we get @xmath53 km s@xmath29 . combining the estimates of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , we find the solar angular velocity with respect to the galactic center to be in good agreement with the measured proper motion of sgr a*. we find that if the fall of mean azimuthal velocity with height @xmath17 above the mid plane is neglected then this leads to an underestimation of @xmath3 .",
    "although our random uncertainty regarding most parameters is quite small , due to large number of stars in the rave survey , significant sources of systematic uncertainty remain , especially regarding @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "our treatment of the vertical dependence of the kinematics is not fully self consistent .",
    "this needs to be investigated with models that can handle the third integral of motion , e.g. , models based on action integrals . also we need to explore dynamical models that are self - consistent rather than pure kinematic models as studied here .",
    "the values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 are also sensitive to the priors on age and distance distribution of stars .",
    "so systematic errors of the order of the uncertainty in the priors are also expected .",
    "when using the shu model , all parameters except @xmath4 and thick - disc parameters , show similar values for rave and gcs .",
    "since there are very few thick disc stars in gcs , we deem the rave thick disc parameters to be more reliable . also , the uncertainty on @xmath44 and @xmath54 is substantially less for rave than for gcs .",
    "the only parameter that is constrained better by gcs than rave is @xmath10 and this is partly due to the fact that we only use radial velocities in rave . in an attempt to build a concordance model , and to enable better comparison between the two data sets , we fix @xmath10 in rave to gcs values and then fix @xmath44 and @xmath45 in gcs to rave values . doing so we find that rave results are within 3@xmath49 of gcs results .",
    "the most significant difference between the two is the value of @xmath4 , which is lower for rave by about @xmath55 .",
    "the presence of prominent kinematic substructures in gcs could be responsible for this discrepancy",
    ". however , inaccuracy in our vertical treatment of kinematics could also be responsible .",
    "we find that the age - velocity dispersion relations in general satisfy @xmath56 , with @xmath9 is closer to @xmath8 than @xmath10 , contrary to the finding of @xcite .",
    "this result is consistent with the physical principle that peculiar motions in the radial and azimuthal directions are strongly coupled by epicyclic dynamics , and large decoupled from vertical motions .",
    "the fitted @xmath57 values depend on whether the thick disc is added separately or is left to be represented by the old tail of the thin disc , and they are naturally higher when it is not added separately .",
    "the axial ratio @xmath11 of the thin disc velocity ellipsoid for the 10 gyr population is consistent with those predicted by @xcite for cloud scattering .",
    "our values of @xmath8 and @xmath10 agree well with age - velocity profiles measured by for ages @xmath58 in simulations of disc galaxies . at ages larger than @xmath59 , a model that consists of power - law growth in the thin disc combined with a distinct thick - disc population , is too crude to represent the simulations adequately . in future",
    "it may be appropriate to use more elaborate models inspired by simulations .    in the shu model ,",
    "the thick disc velocity dispersions for @xmath60 are very similar to those of the old thin disc . however , the radial scale length of the thick - disc velocity dispersions , @xmath45 , proved to be much smaller than that of the thin disc .",
    "@xcite suggested a decrease of radial density scale length with age . in this regard , the role of our adopted priors on age and distance distribution of stars needs to be investigated further .",
    "given the essential role that age plays in disc dynamics , it is unfortunate that the ages of stars are so hard to measure .",
    "fortunately , big advances in this area are expected soon .",
    "stellar astroseismology with missions like corot and kepler makes it possible to measure ages more accurately than before , and gaia will dramatically improve age estimates by geometrically determining distances to large numbers of stars .",
    "meanwhile , chemical abundances , especially of the alpha elements , provides a fair proxy for age at a given metallicity .",
    "hence , studying the relationship of kinematic properties with abundance will be crucial .",
    "@xcite argued that each mono - abundance population has a distinct spatial distribution , and we expect cohorts of coeval stars to have spatial distributions that are characteristic of their ages .",
