    "there exist a fairly large number of papers explicitly or implicitly related to the subject of bcklund transformations ( bts ) applied to the ablowitz - ladik ( al ) model @xcite@xcite : here we just recall the paper by suris @xcite and the more recent one by tsuchida @xcite .",
    "these two authors adopted the original approach of ablowitz and ladik @xcite , based on the zero - curvature representation of the model . more explicitly , suppose that our lattice model possess a lax pair given by @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the label for the lattice site and @xmath2 is the spectral parameter , i.e. an arbitrary constant independent of @xmath1 and @xmath3",
    ". then , the linear problem associated to the model is given by @xcite : @xmath4    to the solution @xmath5 of ( [ lp ] ) we can associate another solution @xmath6 of the same problem multiplying @xmath7 by a suitable matrix @xmath8 , usually called darboux or dressing matrix .",
    "the set of equations obtained @xcite , that is @xmath9 are the natural time discretisation of the system ( [ lp ] ) if we consider the new solution @xmath10 as the old solution @xmath5 but computed at the next time step .",
    "the compatibility condition implied by ( [ dd ] ) is : @xmath11    the above procedure is broadly accepted to be a good starting point to obtain discretisations , but from this point on , there is a bifurcation in the literature results : there are various expressions for the dressing matrix @xmath8 , in particular for its dependence on the spectral parameter , and the solutions of the _ overdetermined _ system ( [ btrelation ] ) are presented in different forms . in @xcite suris",
    "showed how the non local maps found by ablowitz and ladik @xcite can be factored in the composition of simpler and _ local _ transformations , although defined only _",
    "implicitly_. then tsuchida , in his interesting paper @xcite , considers the relation [ btrelation ] for a given lattice system , not necessarily given by the al model .",
    "also he considers the expression obtained taking the determinant on both sides of [ btrelation ] : @xmath12 showing how this is sufficient , under certain conditions , to obtain local expressions for the maps representing the discretisation of the underlying system .",
    "the author is aware of the fact that the discretisation obtained with this method are indeed bts .",
    "however , he seems to not recognize that the algebraic equations solved by certain particular combinations of the dynamical variables appearing in the matrix @xmath8 ( called auxiliary variables  in @xcite ) , can be found by evaluating the determinant of the dressing matrix at a certain constant value of @xmath2 and then setting the result equal to zero .",
    "the relevance of this fact comes from the observation that it allows to obtain _ explicit _ transformations , as shown for example in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite@xcite .",
    "this may imply an improvement in the computations of the discretisation scheme .",
    "basically the maps of ablowitz and ladik are non - local and implicit , the maps of suris and tsuchida are local and implicit , here we show how to get explicit maps , in general non local .",
    "further , we show how our formulation gives a remarkable hamiltonian characterization of the discrete flow . indeed ,",
    "since the bts usually involve the whole hierarchy of commuting flows , it is reasonable to ask which of the flows of the hierarchy we are really discretising . more importantly , the question could be about the possibility to arrange the scheme so to discretise only a particular flow , e.g. the one corresponding to the physical hamiltonian of the model .",
    "we will try to answer these questions following the results of @xcite , where has been shown that the bts for an integrable systems are deeply connected to the hamiltonian structure of the system itself .",
    "indeed they represent the integral curves of another integrable non - autonomous system that shares the conserved quantities with the original model : this observation can be used to obtain an explicit formula for the hamiltonian interpolating the discrete flow defined by the iterations of the bts .",
    "furthermore , for any fixed orbit , the discretisation lies on a suitable ( linear ) combination of the integrals of motion : by choosing in a proper way the parameters appearing in the transformations it is then possible to make the discrete flow and the continuous one parallel for _ all _ time .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec1 ] we briefly recall the results from @xcite ; in section [ sec2 ] we describe how to properly define the overall lax matrix under periodic boundary conditions or in the case of an infinite support ; in section [ sec3 ] we present the core findings of the work , that is the formulae for the explicit discretisation of the model and finally , in section [ sec4 ] , we discuss some analytical and numerical experiments .",
    "first of all , let us collect some known facts about bts",
    ". suppose to have an integrable system with @xmath13 degrees of freedom and @xmath13 quantities @xmath14 conserved and in involution .",
    "denoting by @xmath15 the canonical coordinates , the poisson structure is given by : @xmath16    a diffeomorphism from the phase space to itself , say @xmath17 is a bts if the following two conditions are satisfied :    * the transformations are canonical : @xmath18 * the functions of the phase space given by the conserved quantities are invariant under the action of the map : @xmath19    to simplify the notation we will drop hereafter the subscripts in the independent variables as above . if the transformations are parametric the previous definition remains the same .",
    "in the rest of this section we assume to have parametric transformations with a parameter @xmath20 ; further , we assume that the bts are connected to the identity , so that @xmath21",
    ". as shown in @xcite , these assumptions are not restrictive .",
    "one of the most interesting features of parametric bts is the _ spectrality property _",
    "@xcite : it is deeply related to the hamiltonian structure of the transformations themselves .",
    "let us call the parameter of the transformations @xmath20 .",
    "since the maps are canonical for every value of the parameter @xmath20 , there exists a generating function @xmath22 such that @xcite : @xmath23 the function @xmath22 is a function of the @xmath24 variables @xmath25 and of the parameter @xmath20 .",
    "let us call @xmath26 the partial derivative of @xmath22 with respect to @xmath20 .",
    "we say that the bts possess the spectrality property if , expressing @xmath27 as a function of the variables @xmath15 through the relations ( [ backlund ] ) , that is @xmath28 the function @xmath29 commutes with all the conserved quantities of the system : @xmath30    an immediate consequence of this property is that the bts are the integral curves , whit parameter @xmath20 , of the non autonomous hamiltonian system governed by the function @xmath31 @xcite , that is @xmath32    as a remark , we stress that @xmath31 , as a function on the phase space , is a function of the conserved quantities only @xcite : @xmath33    this result has important consequences as regards the computational application of the bts . indeed , denoting by @xmath34 and @xmath35 the @xmath36-th iteration of the maps , the discrete trajectories defined by the set @xmath37 lie , for every value of @xmath38 , exactly on the integral curves of the autonomous system @xmath39 where the interpolating hamiltonian @xmath40 @xcite is given by @xmath41    the concrete possibility to use the bts in numerical applications comes from the following observation :",
    "for any function @xmath42 on the phase space we can write @xmath43 the functions @xmath44 are constants of motion , so they are constants along the trajectories of the model . having in mind a numerical experiment",
    ", we must fix the numerical values of the initial conditions and those of the parameters .",
    "then , the above formula tell us that we can treat the parameters @xmath44 just as constants : for any fixed set of initial conditions , the discrete trajectories coincide with the continuous ones given by the hamiltonian @xmath45 where the numbers @xmath44 must be calculated according to the formulae ( [ linearcomb ] ) .",
    "suppose now to have a multi - parametric set of bts , depending both on the parameter @xmath20 and on the set @xmath46 , for some integer @xmath47 .",
    "the interpolating hamiltonian ( [ intham ] ) , as well as the constants @xmath44 , will depend on this set of parameters .",
    "these additional degrees of freedom can be used to force the values of the @xmath44 to be equal to some pre - assigned set .",
    "we will see how this method works in the next sections , where we will construct a two - parameter family of bts for the al hierarchy .",
    "the al model is described by the following equations of motion @xcite : @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are dynamical variables on a lattice .",
    "it is possible to consider both periodic boundary conditions , that is @xmath51 and @xmath52 for some @xmath53 , and an infinite chain . for the infinite lattice",
    "we suppose that the variables possess a finite @xmath54 norm : @xmath55 let us discuss the definition of the lax matrix of the model separately .",
    "* periodic case*. in the periodic case , the whole hierarchy of the commuting conserved quantities can be found from the invariants of the lax matrix @xmath56 .",
    "this matrix is defined by the product @xmath57    the determinant of @xmath56 , given by @xmath58 , is a conserved quantity .",
    "the other @xmath59 conserved quantities appear in the laurent expansion of the trace of @xmath56 : @xmath60    the involutivity of these conserved quantities follows from the @xmath61-matrix structure satisfied by the lax matrix : @xmath62,\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is defined by @xcite : @xmath63    the above relations are equivalent to the following poisson brackets for the dynamical variables of the model : @xmath64    the flow [ model ] corresponds to the hamiltonian @xmath65 given by : @xmath66    * infinite chain*. in this case the lax matrix is given by the formula : @xmath67 whenever the limits exist .",
    "it is important to notice that the equation ( [ btrelation ] ) , defining the bts , is homogeneous in @xmath68 : if we multiply the matrices @xmath68 by any scalar number @xmath69 , the bts are not affected by this operation .",
    "let us denote by @xmath70 , @xmath71 , the elements of the lax matrix ( [ mon ] ) . from the homogeneity of ( [ btrelation ] )",
    "it follows that the bts are homogeneous function of degree zero of the elements @xmath70 ; for example for @xmath72 we will see that @xmath73 where @xmath74 are a set of free parameters and @xmath75 stands for a set of functions of the matrix elements @xmath76 evaluated in @xmath77 .",
    "the functions @xmath75 must be all homogeneous of degree zero in the variables @xmath78 , that is @xmath79    the lax matrix ( [ mon ] ) is well defined for @xmath80 if the sequences @xmath81 and @xmath82 have finite @xmath83 norm ( see [ app1 ] ) . however , the functions @xmath75 are well defined even for @xmath84 in all the points where they are continuous . to clarify this point",
    "let us consider the sequence of matrices @xmath85 : @xmath86    the corresponding elements can be written as @xmath87 where the coefficients @xmath88 are functions of the dynamical variables .",
    "consider , for example for @xmath89 , a homogeneous function @xmath90 of degree zero .",
    "due to the absolute convergence of @xmath91 for @xmath80 and using the continuity of the function @xmath92 , we can write @xmath93 the convergence of @xmath90 for @xmath94 can be proved similarly . in the case of an infinite chain , the bts ( [ bts1 ] )",
    "are then well defined also for values of the parameters @xmath74 inside or outside the unit circle .    in the following",
    "we will freely talk about the matrix @xmath56 : the results will apply independently of the boundary conditions assumed .",
    "looking at the @xmath2 dependence of @xmath95 ( [ lk ] ) , we seek a dressing matrix @xmath8 of the form : @xmath96 here @xmath97 is a constant , independent on the lattice label @xmath1 , introduced for later convenience .    as noticed in the introduction , to obtain explicit transformations it is important to have a dressing matrix that is singular when @xmath2 assumes certain constant values .",
    "we will take a matrix @xmath98 possessing two degenerate values of @xmath2 , say @xmath99 and @xmath100 : these values will appear also as free parameters of the transformations .",
    "note that the constraints @xmath101 and @xmath102 leave only two free variables among the four appearing in [ dk ] .",
    "we can parametrize @xmath8 as follows : @xmath103 where @xmath104 and @xmath105 are two new variables.the matrices @xmath106 and @xmath107 possess a kernel by construction , respectively given by @xmath108 by applying @xmath109 to the relation ( [ btrelation ] ) evaluated at @xmath110 we obtain @xmath111 up to an overall factor , @xmath112 is unique .",
    "then , from the previous equation , we can write @xmath113 for some function @xmath114 . more explicitly , after eliminating @xmath114 , we obtain the recursion @xmath115 exactly for the same reason , the variables @xmath105 must obey the recursion : @xmath116 * remark*. if we wish to construct a map preserving the conserved quantities , the boundary values for @xmath105 and @xmath104 are _ not _ arbitrary .    take for example the periodic case .",
    "the lax matrix of the model is given by @xmath117 .",
    "imposing a periodicity also on the dressing matrix , so that @xmath118 for every @xmath1 , form the relations ( [ btrelation ] ) it follows that @xmath119 since the eigenvalues of @xmath56 are time - independent , the isospectral equation ( [ lddl ] ) implies the preservation of the conserved quantities under the action of the map .",
    "the periodicity of @xmath8 means that the variables @xmath104 and @xmath105 are periodic as well : the relations ( [ arec ] ) and ( [ brec ] ) are then periodic continued fraction .",
    "this means that the variables @xmath104 and @xmath105 are solutions of quadratic equations . to find out these quadratic equations",
    ", we must recall that @xmath120 and @xmath121 are degenerate matrices . again , applying the kernels @xmath122 and @xmath123 to the equation ( [ lddl ] ) evaluated respectively at @xmath110 and @xmath124 we obtain @xmath125 this time we conclude that @xmath126 is an eigenvalue of @xmath127 , so we can write @xmath128 from which , eliminating @xmath129 , we obtain the quadratic equations solved by @xmath130 and @xmath131 @xmath132    vice - versa , if we start from these boundary values we will obtain a periodic dressing matrix , since the values @xmath133 and @xmath134 obtained from ( [ arec ] ) and ( [ brec ] ) are equal to those of @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "similarly , in the case of an infinite period , to take the limiting values of @xmath104 and @xmath105 , for @xmath137 , as the solutions of the equations ( [ quaeq ] ) , implies the equivalence @xmath138 which , in turns , implies the preservation of the conserved quantities under the action of the bts .",
    "these results agree with the observations made by tsuchida about the boundary conditions for dressing matrices of lattice systems @xcite .    from the expression ( [ btrelation ] ) , using ( [ brec ] ) and ( [ arec ] ) , we can write the explicit bts as : @xmath139 where @xmath104 and @xmath105 are given by the expressions ( [ arec ] ) and ( [ brec ] ) , with the boundary conditions fixed by the quadratic equations ( [ quaeq ] ) . before to discuss how to determine the sign in the solution of the quadratic equations ( [ quaeq ] ) ,",
    "let us make a remark .",
    "a natural question can arise if one consider other type of boundary values for the variables @xmath104 and @xmath105 : one expects that the transformations will me no more energy preserving ; we will return on this point in section [ sec4 ] , showing indeed how in this case it is possible to obtain the one - soliton solution from the vacuum  solution ( @xmath140 for every @xmath1 ) .",
    "now we are interested in the hamiltonian flows generated by the transformations ( [ bts ] ) , as outlined in section [ sec1 ]",
    ". we must check : 1 ) if the transformations are connected to the identity for some values of the parameters ; 2 ) if the spectrality property holds @xcite .",
    "let us see the first point .",
    "we take opposite signs in the solutions of the quadratic equations ( [ arec]-[brec ] ) for @xmath130 and @xmath131 ( or @xmath141 and @xmath142 in the case of an infinite lattice ) , that is : @xmath143 also , let us pose : @xmath144 in the limit @xmath145 , from ( [ bts ] ) we obtain @xmath146 , @xmath147 for every @xmath1 .",
    "so the transformations are connected to the identity .",
    "let us check the spectrality property .",
    "we need to find the generating function of the canonical transformations ( [ bts ] ) .",
    "this is given by the function @xmath148 satisfying the equation @xmath149 indeed , directly from the poisson structure ( [ pb ] ) , it is possible to check that @xmath150 is a canonical one - form . from appendix [ app2 ]",
    "the function @xmath148 is given by @xmath151 where we define the functions @xmath152 and @xmath153 by the relations @xmath154 these integrals can be explicitly evaluated in term of logarithm and dilogarithm functions .",
    "the variable canonically conjugate to the parameter @xmath20 is , by definition , the derivative of the generating function ( [ genfun ] ) with respect to @xmath20 . inserting ( [ l1l2 ] ) in ( [ genfun ] ) and taking the derivative , we obtain @xmath155 this expression has to be evaluated explicitly in terms of the untilded variables @xmath156 and @xmath157 . as shown in appendix [ app2 ] , the result can be written as @xmath158 where @xmath159 is defined in ( [ albe ] ) .",
    "it is now evident that indeed this expression depends on the dynamical variables only as combinations of conserved quantities , since the trace and the determinant of @xmath56 are time - independent . from equation ( [ spec ] ) , comparing with ( [ x ] ) and ( [ intham ] ) , we get the following two propositions : + * proposition 1*. the bts ( [ bts ] ) are the integral curves , with parameter @xmath20 , of the non - autonomous hamiltonian system of equations governed by the hamiltonian @xmath160 : @xmath161 the integral curves are identified by the initial values , given by @xmath162 and @xmath163 . + * proposition 2*. the discrete trajectories obtained by iterating the map ( [ bts ] ) lie , for every choice of initial values @xmath164 and of parameters @xmath165 , on the respective trajectories of the following hamiltonian system : @xmath166 taking into account ( [ spec ] ) , after some manipulations the formula for the interpolating hamiltonian @xmath40 ( [ hdiseq ] ) can be also written as : @xmath167    a last remark : it is possible to get the reduction @xmath168 in the formulae ( [ bts ] ) for bts , relevant for physical applications . in the previous formula and",
    "in the rest of the paper we use the asterisk to denote complex conjugation .",
    "it is easy to show that if @xmath168 , then the elements of the lax matrix evaluated at @xmath169 and @xmath170 obey the following relations : @xmath171 these relations entails @xmath172 for the function @xmath159 defined in ( [ albe ] ) .",
    "the expressions for @xmath130 and @xmath131 , or @xmath141 and @xmath142 in the case of an infinite lattice , are explicitly given by ( [ albe ] ) . by choosing @xmath173",
    "we obtain @xmath174 , and , from the recursions ( [ arec]-[brec ] ) , @xmath175 for every @xmath1 .",
    "inserting these last equations in ( [ bts ] ) one has @xmath176 provided that @xmath168 .",
    "taking into account ( [ l1l2 ] ) , the reduced bts for the variables @xmath157 read : @xmath177 where in the definition of the variable @xmath104 ( [ arec ] ) and its boundary value ( [ albe ] ) the reductions @xmath175 and @xmath168 must be taken into consideration .",
    "as a first example , we take three interacting bodies . the trace of @xmath56 ( [ trace ] ) is now explicitly given by : @xmath178 taking into account also the expression for the determinant of @xmath56 , the three integrals of motion are given by : @xmath179    according to formulae ( [ hdiseq ] ) and ( [ intham1 ] ) the discrete flow defined by the bts ( [ bts ] ) lies exactly on the continuous flow generated by the hamiltonian @xmath40 given by @xmath180    the three constants of motion @xmath181 , @xmath182 and @xmath183 , given by formula ( [ linearcomb ] ) , are explicitly defined by the expressions @xmath184 where @xmath159 is defined in ( [ albe ] ) .",
    "note that in the definition of @xmath183 there is an extra factor @xmath185 in front of the partial derivative term . in this way we take into account",
    "the fact that in the physical hamiltonian @xmath185 appears as the argument of a logarithm ( see eq .",
    "( [ physflow ] ) ) . with",
    "this choice the continuous flow discretised is given by @xmath186 .",
    "the numerical values of the constants @xmath181 , @xmath182 and @xmath183 are fixed by the values of the initial conditions and those of the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath187 . in figure [ fig1 ]",
    "we plot the continuous trajectory of @xmath188 ( in gray ) and the iterations of the map ( [ bts ] ) ( black dots ) , corresponding to the initial conditions @xmath189 , @xmath190 , and @xmath168 , @xmath191 . in this case , the same plot could be obtained by iterating the map ( [ rbts ] ) .",
    "the values of the conserved quantities are @xmath192 and @xmath193 ; further , we chose the values @xmath194 and @xmath195 , giving @xmath196 , @xmath197 and @xmath198 .        in the next example",
    "we take @xmath199 . as initial conditions we chose @xmath200 and @xmath168 , corresponding , in the continuum limit , to @xmath201 for @xmath202 .",
    "the values of the parameters are @xmath203 and @xmath204 . in figure [ fig2 ]",
    "we report the plots of @xmath205 for @xmath206 , obtained from the map ( [ rbts ] ) .",
    "a soliton structure emerges .    in this particular example",
    "we have sixteen conserved quantities and a bts with two parameters .",
    "the constants of motion @xmath44 , given by ( [ linearcomb ] ) , also depend on the parameters of the map .",
    "if we had sixteen parameters , by picking carefully their values it would be possible to obtain the particular combination of the constants @xmath44 corresponding to the physical flow ( [ physflow ] ) . a bts with @xmath207 parameters can be obtained by composing @xmath208 times the elementary bts ( [ rbts ] ) .",
    "however , the corresponding interpolating hamiltonian will no longer be given by ( [ intham1 ] ) .",
    "to generalize equation ( [ intham1 ] ) to the general case of bts with @xmath207 parameters appears to be difficult , but is an essential step to provide an exact discretisation of the physical flow ( [ physflow ] ) .",
    "our last example is about the classical  use of bts .",
    "we want to obtain a non - trivial flow from the vacuum solution @xmath140 .",
    "considering the same boundary conditions on the variables @xmath104 and @xmath105 as discussed in the previous section , that is @xmath209 and @xmath210 _ or _ @xmath211 and",
    "@xmath212 , we get only the trivial flow @xmath213 and @xmath214 .",
    "this is clear from the fact that in this case the hamiltonian function @xmath29 ( [ spec ] ) is independent of the dynamical variables , is just a constant . by a more physical point of view",
    "it is a consequence of the fact that the transformations , with the aforementioned boundary conditions for @xmath104 and @xmath105 , are energy conserving . to obtain a non - trivial flow from the vacuum solution we must relax these conditions . in the following , for simplicity",
    ", we will retrieve the original notation @xmath99 and @xmath100 for the parameters of the bts ( [ l1l2 ] ) . by taking @xmath140 , the solutions of the recursions ( [ arec ] ) and ( [ brec ] )",
