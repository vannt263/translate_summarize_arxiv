    "strange quarkonia are light ( @xmath6 mesons with at least one strange quark or antiquark in their dominant @xmath2 valence component .",
    "these are known as kaonia if the dominant valence basis state is @xmath0 ( where @xmath7 ) , antikaonia if @xmath8 , and strangeonia if @xmath1 .",
    "a principal goal of light meson spectroscopy is the identification of exotica , which are resonances that are _ not _ dominantly @xmath2 states .",
    "these include glueballs , hybrids , and multiquark systems . in the case of explicitly exotic quantum numbers , such as the j@xmath9 exotic @xmath10 resonance",
    ", exotica can be identified without a comparative study of the @xmath2 spectrum .",
    "models of glueballs and hybrids predict however that the majority of light exotica will have nonexotic quantum numbers , and therefore must be identified against a background of conventional @xmath2 quark model mesons . in some cases , such as the scalar glueball , there is evidence of strong mixing between the gluonic basis state and @xmath2 quarkonium states . in these sectors",
    "it may be difficult to distinguish quarkonia from exotica , although the overpopulation of experimental resonances relative to the naive @xmath2 quark model will indicate the presence of the additional basis states .",
    "searches for the expected rich spectrum of exotica with nonexotic quantum numbers will require a well - established experimental meson spectrum over the relevant mass range of _ ca . _ 1.3 - 2.5  gev , both to eliminate conventional quarkonium states and to study the possibility of a complicated pattern of mixing between exotica and conventional mesons .",
    "the spectrum of meson resonances to 2  gev is only moderately well determined at present , and little is known regarding states above 2.2  gev in any light quark sector .",
    "the @xmath11 multiplets expected to @xmath12  gev are 1s , 2s , 3s , 1p , 2p , 1d and 1f , and of these 44 resonances , _ ca .",
    "_ 30 are now known .",
    "of the 22 corresponding kaonia expected to 2.1  gev , _ ca .",
    "_ 13 are known .",
    "strangeonia in contrast are a _",
    "terra incognita_. counting the maximally mixed @xmath13-@xmath14 as one @xmath1 state",
    ", only 7 probable @xmath1 resonances of the 22 expected to 2.2  gev are widely accepted , these being the @xmath13-@xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 . as we shall see , there are controversies regarding the nature of two of these states as well .",
    "in this paper we give detailed theoretical predictions for the strong decay amplitudes of two - body decay modes of all the strange mesons expected in the quark model to _ ca .",
    "_ 2.2  gev .",
    "these decay amplitudes and partial and total widths are derived in the @xmath4p@xmath5 model , which ( in several variants ) is the standard model for strong decays . since most experiments will rely on strong decay modes and amplitudes to identify and classify meson resonances , we have derived decay amplitudes to all open - flavor two body modes that are nominally accessible .",
    "these results should be of use in establishing strange @xmath2 mesons , as well as in the identification of non-@xmath2 exotica .",
    "our results are presented in detailed tables of decay amplitudes , with entries for each resonance , decay mode and amplitude .",
    "we also include a short discussion of each quark model state and associated experimental candidates in the text , and where possible we compare our theoretical decay amplitudes to the data",
    ". we also note especially interesting theoretical and experimental results .    in most cases we assume pure @xmath2 mesons with definite j , l and s as both initial and final states . in some cases , such as kaonia with j = l ,",
    "spectroscopic mixing is allowed and is known experimentally to be important , so we give results as functions of mixing angles .",
    "finally , in certain channels such as @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( @xmath13-@xmath14 and @xmath23 states ) mixing between basis states of different flavor appears to be a large effect , and our results in these channels should be interpreted as decay amplitudes for initial ideal basis states , intended as a reference for contrast with experimental decays of the more complicated mixed states .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : after this introduction we summarize the p0 decay model used here ; some additional technical details of the calculations are discussed in an appendix . after the decay model we discuss decays of strangeonia , and consider the status of states and give decay predictions for all states in the 1s , 2s , 3s , 1p , 2p , 1d and 1f multiplets , in that order .",
    "the following section carries out this exercise for kaonia .",
    "our numerical results for these decay amplitudes and widths are presented in extensive decay tables following the text .",
    "finally we give our summary and conclusions , and suggest topics of interest for future studies of strong decays .",
    "we employ the p0 decay model with sho @xmath2 wavefunctions to evaluate two - body open - flavor strong decay amplitudes and widths .",
    "this model of strong decays was introduced over thirty years ago by micu  @xcite , and was applied extensively to meson decays in the 1970s by leyaouanc _",
    "this decay model assumes that strong decays take place through the production of a @xmath2 pair with vacuum quantum numbers ( @xmath22 , which corresponds to the p0 state of a @xmath2 pair ) .",
    "after pair creation the @xmath24 system separates into two mesons in all possible ways , which corresponds to the two decay diagrams shown in fig.a1 of appendix a. hairpin diagrams are assumed absent , and in any case would not be allowed by momentum conservation in this version of the p0 model .",
    "since this model predates qcd and has no clear relation to it , one might expect that a description of decays in terms of allowed qcd processes such as one gluon exchange ( oge ) might be more realistic .",
    "there is strong experimental evidence that the @xmath2 pair created during the decay does have spin one ( @xmath25 ) , as is assumed in both the p0 and oge decay models .",
    "the strong experimental upper limit on the decay @xmath26 ( from the ves collaboration @xcite ) of @xmath27 provides striking evidence in favor of @xmath25 . in the @xmath2 quark model",
    "this is a @xmath28d@xmath29p@xmath30s@xmath5 transition , and any @xmath31 transition from a spin - singlet to spin - singlets has a vanishing matrix element if the @xmath32 pair is created with spin one .    a recent detailed theoretical study of light meson decays from oge pair production  @xcite found that oge decay amplitudes were typically rather smaller than required by experiment ( the single exception found was @xmath33p@xmath34s@xmath35s@xmath5 ) and hence are presumably masked by a dominant , nonperturbative decay mechanism . in addition , in certain decay amplitude ratios such as the d / s ratios in @xmath36 ( recently remeasured by the e852 collaboration @xcite ) and @xmath37 there is a clear preference for @xmath2 production from a p0 rather than an oge source  @xcite .    it is widely assumed that the p0 model is successful because it gives a reasonably accurate description of a nonperturbative @xmath2 pair production mechanism , such as breaking of the gluonic flux tube between quark and antiquark sources through production of a new @xmath2 pair along the path of the flux tube",
    "presumably , future studies of lattice qcd will lead to a more fundamental description of this strong decay process .",
    "here we simply assume the @xmath4p@xmath5 model , because of its success as an approximate description of much of the experimental data on strong decays .",
    "although the p0 model is difficult to justify theoretically , it apparently does give a good description of many of the observed decay amplitudes and partial widths of open - flavor meson strong decays .",
    "there have been many references published on the decays of light , strange mesons using variants of the p0 model ( see table [ calcs ] ) with different choices for the meson wavefunctions , the treatment of phase space , and the details of the p0 @xmath2 source .",
    "the flux - tube decay model  @xcite is one well - known generalization of the p0 model , in which the source strength is assumed to be largest along a path connecting the initial quark and antiquark .",
    ".[calcs ] some previous theoretical studies of strange meson decays in the literature .",
    "we indicate whether _ amplitudes _ are quoted , whether decay widths are displayed for the individual _ waves _ , and the _ phase space _",
    "( relativistic ( r ) or mock meson ( m ) ) and _ wavefunctions _ used ( simple harmonic oscillator ( sho ) or other ( o ) ) . [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we note in passing that the @xmath38 has been reported in d - meson nonleptonic weak decays , @xmath39 in the @xmath40 mode @xcite , so this approach might allow observation of the interesting modes @xmath41 ( comparable to @xmath42 and @xmath43 in future ( see app.b ) .",
    "the @xmath46 sector is especially interesting because it allows tests of models of mixing between spin - singlet and spin - triplet states , as is seen in the @xmath47 system . if this is a short - distance effect we might expect to find much stronger mixing in the p - wave @xmath47 system than in the d - wave @xmath46 states .",
    "the smaller mass splitting in the @xmath46 sector suggests that the mixing angle @xmath48 may well be smaller here .",
    "since the @xmath46 states are 400 - 500 mev higher in mass , one can measure their couplings to many decay modes that are inaccessible to the 1p @xmath47 states .",
    "this will allow many checks of the p0 decay model , since if it is accurate a single value of the mixing angle @xmath48 should correlate a large number of decays . in tables",
    "k12 and k13 we give results for the decay amplitudes and partial widths of the @xmath46 states with general mixing angles ,    @xmath49    and @xmath50    one can see in the decay tables that many @xmath46 partial widths are strongly dependent on the mixing angle @xmath48 .",
    "the relatively clean modes @xmath51 and @xmath52 are especially interesting because their @xmath53 cross terms have opposite signs , so the ratio @xmath54 depends strongly on the @xmath46 mixing angle .",
    "the odd - l @xmath55 mode is strongly @xmath48-dependent as well , and is predicted to couple dominantly to the spin - singlet @xmath56d@xmath57 component of the initial @xmath46 state ( app.b , table  b2 ) .",
    "the vv modes @xmath58 and @xmath59 are interesting because there is no @xmath53 cross term in the partial widths ; the individual subamplitudes are proportional to @xmath60 or @xmath61 only",
    ". a determination of the relative @xmath62p@xmath57 and @xmath63p@xmath57 vv amplitudes would be an excellent independent check of @xmath48 , although these modes may be too weak to allow this measurement .",
    "the @xmath64 mode is also interesting , because it could be weak or dominant , depending on the value of @xmath48 .",
    "unfortunately the experimental data on the @xmath46 states is not yet sufficiently quantitative to be compared usefully to our decay predictions .",
    "the pdg claims that @xmath64 is the dominant @xmath44 decay mode , but the individual experiments are not all in agreement about this .",
    "the @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath51 modes of the @xmath44 are all  seen \" , which is at least encouraging for our proposed future determination of @xmath48 from @xmath68 .",
    "the @xmath45 data is even less constraining , with only two experimental references .",
    "the modes @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath51 are again  seen \" in the pdg summary .",
    "@xcite actually report a strong preference for @xmath64 , @xmath69 . in comparison",
    "they quote @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "this large @xmath72 ratio is not consistent with the p0-model prediction that these two modes have comparable strengths .",
    "the lass observation @xcite of both p- and f - wave contributions to the transition @xmath73 ( table  2 of ref.@xcite ) is quite interesting , as we find that the f / p amplitude ratios for both @xmath74 transitions vary rapidly with the singlet - triplet mixing angle @xmath48 .",
    "although the lass results are not very statistically significant ( the f - waves are @xmath75 and @xmath76 from zero ) , they do show that f / p is quite small in @xmath77 .",
    "this argues in favor of a sizeable and negative @xmath46 mixing angle ; a vanishing @xmath77 f - wave requires @xmath78 .",
    "the @xmath79 is the single well - established member of the 1f kaon multiplet .",
    "it is assumed to be the flavor partner of the @xmath11 states @xmath80 and @xmath81 and perhaps the lass @xmath1 candidate @xmath82 .",
    "the reported mass is much closer to the @xmath11 states than the @xmath1 candidate , which is surprising , and is reminiscent of the @xmath83 .",
    "the pdg total width of @xmath84 mev is somewhat larger than our theoretical expectation of @xmath85 mev .",
    "the p0 model predicts that only a few low - lying two - body modes of the @xmath79 have branching fractions larger than a few percent .",
    "this weakness of higher - mass modes is typical of a high - l , high - j state , since the angular threshold barriers for decays combined with smaller phase space leads to smaller branching fractions .",
    "the largest modes are predicted to be @xmath58 and @xmath86 , with branching fractions of @xmath87 and @xmath88 respectively .",
    "the predicted partial width @xmath89  mev is consistent with the reported lass @xmath86 branching fraction of @xmath90  @xcite , given their total width of about 200 mev .",
    "we note however that this agreement is rather fortuitous , since this is a g - wave final state and as such has very strong @xmath91 threshold behavior .",
    "only three other modes are predicted to be larger than @xmath92 , these being @xmath59 , @xmath67 and @xmath65 .",
    "the @xmath93 mode , with a reported branching fraction of @xmath94 , can be used to test the assumed flavor independence of the @xmath11 and @xmath1 pair production amplitudes in the novel vv channel .",
    "our predicted branching fraction of @xmath95 is consistent with experiment at the current limited accuracy .",
    "a comparison of the @xmath93 mode with @xmath58 or @xmath59 would constitute an interesting direct test of the assumed flavor ( quark mass ) independence of the @xmath2 pair - production amplitude in the p0 model , since @xmath93 requires @xmath1 pair production whereas @xmath58 and @xmath59 require @xmath11 .",
    "it is interesting that the reported pdg branching fractions only account for about half of the @xmath79 decays .",
    "the @xmath4p@xmath5 model does not anticipate any additional modes with sufficient strength to explain this discrepancy .",
    "we assume a mass of 2050 mev for the @xmath33f@xmath57 kaon , which is a rounded @xmath79 mass .",
    "since this is a high - mass state with low @xmath97 , we find that many two - body final states are predicted to have significant couplings .",
    "axial - vector plus pseudoscalar modes are among the most important ; @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 ( in decreasing order of branching fraction ) are all predicted to be in the @xmath102 range .",
    "the s - wave mode @xmath103 is also predicted to have a large ( @xmath88 ) branching fraction , although this is strongly dependent on the 2p singlet - triplet mixing angle ; we have assumed hqet values for the two @xmath46 states , analogous to the @xmath104 and @xmath105 , and if this is inaccurate there may be a large @xmath106 mode .",
    "the  standard \" light modes such as @xmath86 are predicted to couple rather weakly to this state .",
    "@xmath86 , @xmath67 and @xmath65 have predicted branching fractions of only about @xmath92 .",
    "one attractive approach to identifying this state would be to observe it in @xmath43 ( also a _ ca .",
    "_ @xmath92 branch ) , but not in @xmath41 , which is a signature for decays to these even - l final states ( app.b ) .",
    "should this state be identified , there is an interesting @xmath4p@xmath5 decay model prediction that the light vv modes @xmath107 and @xmath93 will couple quite weakly , since they are predicted to have zero coupling in s - wave .",
    "we might _ a priori _ have expected the s - wave to be the largest vv amplitude .",
    "there is a possible lass candidate for this state at @xmath108 mev @xcite , reported in @xmath67 and @xmath65 , with a total width of @xmath109  mev and a relative branching fraction of @xmath110",
    ". these results are consistent with our expectations for a @xmath33f@xmath57 kaon .",
    "the two j@xmath112 1f states will provide an independent test of models of the mixing between spin - singlet and spin - triplet kaon states , such as is observed in the 1p @xmath104-@xmath105 system .",
    "we can expect the predicted 1f mixing angle to depend rather strongly on the assumed mechanism .",
    "if it is a short distance effect it should be much smaller in the l=3 @xmath113 states than in 1p , whereas if it is simply a mixing angle chosen by heavy - quark symmetry , the 1f @xmath113 and 1p @xmath47 values should be similar .",
    "since the @xmath113 states have much higher masses , there are many more decay modes that can be used to determine this mixing angle .",
    "we will assume a mass of 2050  mev for both 1f @xmath113 states , so we need only quote results for one linear combination , which we take to be @xmath114 the decay amplitudes and partial widths are given in table  k15 as functions of @xmath48 .",
    "note that the total width is not strongly dependent on the mixing angle ; we expect these states to have total widths of _ ca .",
    "_ 200 - 250 mev whatever the value of @xmath48 .    the psv modes @xmath67 , @xmath51 , @xmath65 and @xmath52 have significant partial widths , and it is notable that the sign of the @xmath115 cross term is channel - dependent ; thus there is especially strong @xmath48-dependence in ratios such as @xmath116 .    the vv modes have the interesting feature that their partial widths have no @xmath115 cross term , because the individual l , s subamplitudes are proportional to either @xmath60 or @xmath61 .",
    "( this was also noted for mixed 2p state decays . )",
    "thus measurements of the @xmath58 or @xmath59 subamplitudes directly access @xmath60 and @xmath61 .    in the higher - mass final states we find large branching fractions to @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 , again with strong @xmath48-dependence .",
    "the final state @xmath120 is interesting in that it is the only open @xmath111 mode with an s - wave amplitude .",
    "in this paper we have presented a detailed survey of the status and strong decays of all strange mesons expected in the quark model up to _ ca . _ 2.2  gev .",
    "this includes the 1s , 2s , 3s , 1p , 2p , 1d and 1f multiplets of strangeonia and kaonia , making a total of 44 states .",
    "42 of these have strong decays ( 43 since we consider @xmath121 flavor mixing ) , and we have carried out calculations of all the energetically allowed open - flavor decays of all these states in the p0 model .",
    "all independent decay amplitudes and partial and total widths were evaluated numerically and presented in detailed decay tables . in total",
    "we have given numerical results for 525 two - body decay modes and 891 decay amplitudes .",
    "this work is intended as a guide for future experimental studies of meson spectroscopy , to indicate what modes and amplitudes are expected to be important and are theoretically interesting , as well as to allow the identification of unusual states such as glueballs and hybrids through their anomalous decay properties .",
    "we have identified several very interesting issues for future experimental studies involving the conventional quark model states .",
    "as one example , in the @xmath1 sector we predict two rather narrow states that have not been identified , the @xmath33d@xmath57 @xmath122 with @xmath123  mev ( with large @xmath124 and @xmath125 modes ) and the @xmath28d@xmath57 @xmath126 ( assuming it is pure @xmath1 ; see below ) with @xmath127  mev , decaying mainly to @xmath124 . the @xmath121 states at 1617 and 1842  mev are also very interesting because the higher - mass state is only seen in @xmath128 .",
    "we consider the effect of a large @xmath129 mixing angle , and note that this implies important @xmath124 modes that are not evident in the data ; the possibility that the higher - mass @xmath130 is a nonstrange hybrid rather than a quarkonium state certainly merits consideration .",
    "future searches for c=@xmath131 @xmath1 states might exploit the @xmath125 and @xmath132  @xmath1-signature modes \" , which are not directly accessible to light @xmath11 mesons .",
    "there are many interesting issues in the kaon sector .",
    "one is the amount of spin singlet - triplet mixing in the series of @xmath133 kaons .",
    "the @xmath104-@xmath105 system is known to have a large singlet - triplet mixing angle , and the physical origin is not well established .",
    "similar mixing is considered in the 2p , 1d  @xmath46 \" and 1f  @xmath113 \" systems , and it is noted that the decay amplitudes and partial widths of these states are often very sensitive to these mixing angles .",
    "quantitative studes of these strong decay amplitudes and branching fractions will allow the determination of these mixing angles , and can also provide tests of the accuracy of the p0 decay model .",
    "kaons are much better established experimentally than @xmath1 states ; of the 21 theoretical excited kaon levels we consider , just eight do not have plausible associated experimental candidates .",
    "the eight unknown kaon states are predicted to have total widths in the @xmath134 - 400  mev range , and the modes @xmath67 , @xmath58 and @xmath65 should be useful for the identification of most of these states .",
    "an interesting exception is the @xmath33f@xmath57 @xmath96 , which is predicted to have large branching fractions to the unusual modes @xmath98 , @xmath103 and @xmath135 .",
    "kaon decays to modes with an @xmath13 or @xmath14 are especially interesting , in that an interference takes place between the @xmath136 and @xmath137 components of the final @xmath13 or @xmath14 .",
    "this interference is strongly constructive or destructive depending on the channel and angular quantum numbers , and there is strong experimental evidence of this effect in @xmath138 decays .",
    "the associated selection rules have also been applied to d and b meson weak decays to @xmath41 and related final states , where unusual branching fractions have been observed .",
    "we derived these selection rules from our strong decay amplitudes in appendix b , and noted that there is a nontrivial generalization to modes such as @xmath139 in b decays .",
    "finally , this work should be useful in searches for glueballs and hybrids , assuming configuration mixing is not large , as one should eliminate the @xmath2 quark model  background \" in any search for new , unconventional meson resonances .",
    "we also note that the spectrum of kaons will appear rather different from the spectrum of @xmath11 or @xmath1 states if mixing between quarkonia and hybrids _ is _ important , because kaonia mix with more hybrid basis states due to the absence of c - parity .",
    "this may lead to irregularities in relative level positions in the @xmath11 and excited kaon spectra , as perhaps is already evident in the low mass of the strange @xmath140 relative to the @xmath11 state @xmath141 .",
    "irregularities between the kaon and i=1 @xmath11 spectra may thus signal the presence of hybrid basis states .",

    "in this appendix we discuss some details of the p0 decay calculations that are presented in this paper .",
    "our diagrammatic , momentum - space formulation of the p0 model is described in ref.@xcite , and our results are essentially an extension of the decay model calculations of ref.@xcite , which considered only @xmath11 mesons in detail .",
    "the p0 model describes open - flavor meson strong decay as a @xmath2 pair - production process , in which the new @xmath2 pair separate into final @xmath2 mesons b and c. the pair is assumed to be produced in a j@xmath158 state ( hence  p0 model \" ) , corresponding to vacuum quantum numbers .",
    "this choice is supported by experimental amplitude ratios , notably the d / s ratios in @xmath159 @xcite and @xmath160 . as noted in ref.@xcite , the usual p0 decay amplitude is equivalent to the nonrelativistic limit of the interaction lagrangian @xmath161 , with the identification @xmath162 .",
    "( the dimensionless @xmath163 is the pair - production amplitude , which is taken to be a free parameter in the p0 model . ) in this first detailed survey of strange meson decays we have chosen to avoid the complications of moderate parameter variations and the effect of the larger strange quark mass on the meson wavefunctions , and present results that follow from the previously assumed @xmath11 sho wavefunctions .",
    "thus the analytical results for amplitudes given in app.a of ref.@xcite are valid for this paper as well .",
    "we assume the same sho wavefunction width parameter and pair - production amplitude as ref.@xcite , @xmath164 comparison of partial widths to experiment for light decays of strange states shows that the predictions are indeed a useful guide with these parameters .",
    "one should of course expect a slight decrease in length scale and hence a slightly larger @xmath165 in the strange mesons , due to the heavier strange quark .",
    "this interaction leads to the two feynman diagrams of fig.1 for the process @xmath166 . as shown in ref.@xcite , the t - matrix element for each diagram in a given decay is the product of separate factors for flavor , spin , and a convolution integral involving the three mesons spatial wavefunctions .",
    "there is an additional overall  signature \" phase of @xmath167 due to quark operator anticommutation .",
    "the color degree of freedom , which would lead to a common overall multiplicative color factor , is suppressed .",
    "the meson flavor states follow the conventions of ref.@xcite . the fundamental quark flavor-@xmath168 and antiquark flavor-@xmath169 are @xmath170 and @xmath171 , so for example @xmath172 and @xmath173 but @xmath174 , @xmath175 , and @xmath176 .",
    "unless otherwise stated we take the @xmath13 and @xmath14 to be maximally mixed flavor states , @xmath177 @xmath178 where the i=0 state @xmath179 is @xmath180 for cases in which we consider the dependence on the @xmath13-@xmath14 mixing angle we use an expansion in @xmath2 flavor states , with a flavor mixing angle @xmath181 ;    @xmath182    and @xmath183 0.5 cm the more common expansion in su(3 ) octet and singlet flavor states is @xmath184 and @xmath185 these expansions imply a relation between @xmath181 and @xmath186 , @xmath187 our maximally mixed states , with @xmath188 , correspond to the familiar value @xmath189 .",
    "the strange mesons @xmath104 and @xmath105 also require careful phase definitions , since various conventions have appeared in the literature .",
    "we define the singlet - triplet mixing angle @xmath48 for @xmath190 axial kaon states as    @xmath191    as we noted in the section on @xmath47 mesons , our mixing angle @xmath48 is opposite in sign to that of blundell and godfrey @xcite , because they apply eqs.(a13,a14 ) to @xmath8 antikaons , whereas we apply it to @xmath0 kaons .",
    "two physically independent values of @xmath48 follow from the hqet limit @xmath192 , which are @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "reference to fig.4 shows that the data strongly prefer @xmath195 , which gives the hqet @xmath47 states @xmath196 this choice assigns the lighter @xmath104 state to the @xmath197 multiplet , which may appear surprising since the @xmath197 axial is expected to be the higher - mass state in the hqet limit .",
    "of course the hqet limit is difficult to justify for strange quarks ; this limit also anticipates a higher - mass @xmath33p@xmath57 state relative to the @xmath33p@xmath5 , whereas these are approximately degenerate in the experimental excited kaon spectrum .",

    "amplitude ratios allow sensitive tests of the nature of a resonance , so it is important to determine these with well - defined relative phases . to quote specific amplitudes in the decay tables we have specialized to particular charge states , which are illustrated by the examples in table  a1 .",
    "note that the bc ordering is important ; if we exchange mesons b and c in table  a1 or in the decay tables , we change the phases of the decay amplitudes . to obtain a unique set of phases we define @xmath248 as the recoil direction of meson b ( with c along @xmath249 ) , and the amplitudes",
    "are taken to be the coefficients of the t - matrix expansion in orthonormal angular momentum eigenfunctions @xmath250 .",
    "for spinless final mesons b and c , these amplitudes are the coefficients of a spherical harmonic expansion .",
    "the total decay rate is given by the t - matrix amplitude squared , integrated over final angles , summed over all final spin and charge states , and multiplied by the physical , relativistic phase space ; again this procedure is described in detail in ref.@xcite .",
    "( we note in passing that the @xmath251 example in that reference has a typographical error in eq.(a17 ) ; the factor of @xmath252 should be @xmath253 , as stated in the subsequent text . )",
    "since we neglect mass splittings within an isomultiplet , the sum over charge states acts as a simple multiplier of the partial width into the specific charge channel used as our example ; this multiplier is quoted as @xmath254 in table  a1 .",
    "this @xmath254 also incorporates the @xmath255 statistical factor present if b and c are identical .",
    "the actual light meson masses used here are @xmath256  mev , @xmath257  mev , @xmath258  mev , @xmath259  mev , @xmath260  mev , @xmath261  mev , @xmath262  mev , @xmath263  mev , @xmath264  mev , @xmath265  mev , @xmath266  mev , @xmath267  mev , @xmath268  mev , @xmath269  mev , @xmath270  mev and @xmath271  mev . for the less familiar higher - mass states we used the resonance label to display the assumed mass .",
    "for example , the @xmath140 entries in the decay tables imply that we assumed a @xmath272 mass of 1414  mev in our decay calculations .    @xmath273",
    "the relative branching fractions of decays of an excited kaon to the pairs of modes @xmath276 and @xmath277 are very interesting , in that they involve constructive or destructive interference between the @xmath278 and @xmath279 internal components of the @xmath280 or @xmath281 meson .",

    "we consider the application to excited kaon strong decays , and derive the associated selection rules .",
    "the results are counterintuitive , in that the higher - mass @xmath14 decay mode is often favored over the @xmath13 mode .",
    "to illustrate these selection rules , we first consider the decay of a generic excited kaon @xmath282 , with flavor state @xmath283 , to @xmath284 .",
    "( the @xmath282 must have @xmath285 because the spin matrix element @xmath286 vanishes in the p0 model . )",
    "we first attach the flavor state vectors @xmath287 to the two feynman diagrams in fig.a1 .",
    "evidently diagram @xmath288 only couples to the @xmath137 component of the @xmath13 , requires @xmath1 pair production , and gives a flavor factor ( flavor matrix element ) of @xmath289 .",
    "following lipkin @xcite , we also assume an @xmath1 pair - production suppression factor of @xmath290 .",
    "diagram @xmath291 instead requires @xmath292 pair production and only couples to the @xmath293 component of the @xmath13 , giving a flavor factor of @xmath294 . combining these factors , and carrying out this exercise for the @xmath14 as well , we find the generalized flavor factors given in table b1 .      since @xmath300 in practice",
    ", it is clear from the table that decays to @xmath41 would experience destructive interference between diagrams @xmath288 and @xmath291 if the flavor factors were the only relevant variables .",
    "conversely , decays to @xmath43 experience constructive flavor interference .",
    "if the amplitudes associated with diagrams @xmath288 and @xmath291 were equal , neglecting phase space differences the branching fraction ratio would be @xmath301 for maximally mixed states @xmath302 without @xmath1 pair - production suppression @xmath303 this ratio is @xmath304 which shows that this interference can have a dramatic effect .",
    "of course the amplitudes associated with diagrams @xmath288 and @xmath291 are _ not _ equal in general .",
    "they instead have diagram - dependent , coupled spin factors and spatial overlap integrals , which in the p0 model are cg - weighted sums of terms of the form @xmath305 and @xmath306 here @xmath307 is the spin - vector matrix element of the @xmath2 pair produced in the spin state implied by each diagram .",
    "we can take the @xmath308 and @xmath309 overlaps @xmath310 to be single terms ( b6 ) and ( b7 ) for each diagram without loss of generality because the final mesons factor as @xmath311 , and the initial meson @xmath282 is the sum of @xmath312 factored components that can be treated individually as the initial @xmath282 .",
    "each @xmath282 component gives a single @xmath313 matrix element , which is the same for both diagrams because the final @xmath41 or @xmath43 spin state @xmath314 is symmetrical .",
    "the @xmath288 and @xmath291 spatial overlap integrals evidently satisfy @xmath315 for _ any _ set of meson spatial wavefunctions .",
    "since these integrals are related by parity , and the final states we are considering have definite parity @xmath316 , we may remove a common factor and find for the @xmath308 decay amplitude @xmath317 and similarly for @xmath309 @xmath318 neglecting phase space differences , the @xmath319 branching fraction ratio is again the amplitude ratio squared , @xmath320 0.5 cm which generalizes the s - wave result ( b4 ) .",
    "this agrees with lipkin s eq.(10b ) in ref.@xcite , in which the maximally - mixed case @xmath321 was assumed .",
    "evidently the general rule is that odd - l final states favor @xmath41 , and even - l favors @xmath43 .",
    "observation of the enhanced @xmath43 modes requires the study of even - j kaonia with masses well above @xmath322  gev .",

    "only the 1@xmath4f@xmath323 has a widely accepted experimental candidate , the @xmath324 .",
    "unfortunately the @xmath325 branching fraction is predicted to be quite small , due to the g - wave centrifical barrier .",
    "identification of these as yet unknown 2p and 1@xmath4f@xmath57 states could prove difficult because they are all expected to be rather broad , with @xmath134-@xmath326  mev . in part because of these large widths the theoretical branching fractions of these states to the enhanced @xmath43 modes are unfortunately not especially large ; all are 3 - 5@xmath327",
    ".    it will be easier to test the selection rule on @xmath41 states alone , since this mode has a much lower threshold of @xmath328  gev .",
    "the branching fraction ratio relative to @xmath86 , which provides a convenient reference , is @xmath329 if we again neglect phase space differences .",
    "for the maximally - mixed case with no @xmath1 suppression this becomes @xmath330 0.5 cm which shows that @xmath41 will be comparable to @xmath86 in strength in odd - l@xmath331 modes ( decays of odd - j kaons ) , but a factor of @xmath332 smaller than @xmath86 in decays of even - j kaons .",
    "of course this simple estimate should be corrected for phase space , which usually leads to additional suppression of the @xmath41 mode relative to @xmath86 .",
    "a very weak @xmath41 mode has already been reported in the decay of the even - j @xmath333 , as expected ( table 4 ) .",
    "this suppression of @xmath41 in even - l final states could also be tested in @xmath324 decays .",
    "in contrast we should see large @xmath41 branching fractions in odd - l final states , arising for example from decays of the odd - j spin - triplet states @xmath140 ( assuming this actually _ is _ the @xmath334s@xmath335 kaon ) , the @xmath336 and the @xmath38 .",
    "the @xmath337 is especially attractive for this study because it is relatively narrow , and there is already evidence from lass @xcite that the @xmath338 mode is enhanced approximately as expected ; the pdg width and @xmath86 branching fraction , combined with the lass @xmath339 ratio @xcite correspond to @xmath340  mev , consistent with our theoretical prediction of 19  mev ( see table 6 ) .        the selection rules for decays to @xmath13 and @xmath14 and an @xmath25  @xmath272 \" kaon are rather more complicated , as they depend on the @xmath342 of the initial kaon as well .",

    "it is possible to test the second ( @xmath374 ) selection rule in other b meson decays .",
    "assuming an initial j@xmath371 spin - triplet source and a final state of an @xmath13 or @xmath14 combined with a spin - triplet kaon , it follows that the final kaon must have j = l@xmath350 and unnatural spin parity .",
    "the spin - triplet excited kaons accessible in @xmath374 b decays therefore have j@xmath375 .",
    "unfortunately these are just those kaon systems that experience singlet - triplet mixing , so we can not observe a pure @xmath374 transition in isolation .",
    "experimentally we must instead study decays to singlet - triplet mixed states , in which both @xmath372 and @xmath374 transition amplitudes are present .",
    "we may illustrate this using transitions to @xmath376 as an example .",
    "the decays @xmath377 create a p - wave ( odd - l@xmath350 ) , j@xmath371 final states , and hence are driven by an initial excited j@xmath371 @xmath4p@xmath5 @xmath378 source . from table  b2 the @xmath374 amplitude , which couples the @xmath379 to the @xmath380p@xmath381 @xmath378 component of the @xmath104 , strongly favors the @xmath14 .",
    "however the @xmath382p@xmath381 @xmath383 component of the @xmath104 is also excited , through a @xmath372 transition , which in odd - l@xmath350 dominantly favors the @xmath13 .",
    "thus the relative branching fraction @xmath384 follows from a competition between these two processes , and is given by @xmath385 assuming complete dominance by the larger amplitudes in table  b2 .",
    "unfortunately these two amplitudes are different functions of momenta , so the @xmath386 state ratio is multiplied by a squared ratio of unknown transition amplitudes .",
    "a simplification is possible , since the corresponding result for the @xmath105 has @xmath60 and @xmath61 exchanged ; if we take the ratio of relative branching fractions , we find a result that only involves the mixing angle @xmath48 ( neglecting phase space differences between modes ) , @xmath387 for higher - mass states such as the @xmath46 kaons this  mixed \" selection rule may thus allow an estimate of the corresponding singlet - triplet mixing angle , using the analogous @xmath388 and @xmath389 decays .",
    "to test these @xmath390 strong selection rules directly in excited kaon decays we would ideally prefer a parent resonance with sufficient mass to populate both @xmath55 and @xmath341 .",

    "unfortunately there are important centrifical barriers , especially in the decays of the @xmath33f@xmath323 @xmath392 , which restrict the @xmath55 branching fractions of these 1f states to a few percent .",
    "a measurement of the ratio @xmath393 might be feasible for the @xmath33f@xmath57 @xmath96 state , once this resonance is identified .",
    "just as we found previously in considering @xmath41 and @xmath43 decays , it will be easier to study the strength of the lower mass mode @xmath55 , since the lower threshold of @xmath394  gev makes more resonance couplings accessible .",
    "the ratio @xmath393 can provide a normalized measure of the strength of the @xmath55 mode . of the states we have considered ,",
    "the single spin - triplet excited kaon below @xmath341 threshold that is expected to have a large @xmath55 branching fraction is the as yet unidentified @xmath334p@xmath57 @xmath395 ; this has a theoretical branching fraction of @xmath396 , and a branching fraction ratio of @xmath397 .",

    "decay amplitudes of the mixed singlet - triplet mesons to these modes are quite sensitive to the singlet - triplet mixing angles , and may be useful in determining these parameters more accurately ; even in the relatively well - studied 1p case ( @xmath104 and @xmath105 ) the mixing angle is not well determined by the existing decay measurements ( see fig.4 ) .",
    "since the mixed - spin kaons all have unnatural @xmath399 , the lightest final state of relevance here is @xmath55 , which can be used to estimate the singlet - triplet mixing for example in the expected @xmath400p@xmath335-@xmath334p@xmath335 @xmath401 and @xmath28f@xmath398-@xmath33f@xmath398 @xmath111 pairs .",
