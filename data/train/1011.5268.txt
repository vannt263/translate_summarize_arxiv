    "the su(3 ) group theoretical approach to deal with baryon magnetic moments was first developed by coleman and glashow @xcite ; their analysis lead to the celebrated relations named after them among octet baryons in terms of two parameters , namely , @xmath4 2\\mu_\\lambda^{(0 ) } = \\mu_n^{(0 ) } , & \\qquad   \\qquad & \\mu_{\\xi^-}^{(0 ) } = \\mu_{\\sigma^-}^{(0 ) } , \\\\[4 mm ] \\mu_{\\xi^0}^{(0 ) } = \\mu_n^{(0 ) } , & \\qquad   \\qquad & 2\\mu_{\\lambda\\sigma^0}^{(0 ) } = -\\sqrt{3}\\mu_n^{(0 ) } , \\label{eq : cg } \\end{array } \\label{eq : treeval}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] along with the isospin relation @xmath5 where the superscript @xmath6 will denote to the su(3 ) symmetric values hereafter .",
    "soon after the discovery of relations ( [ eq : cg ] ) , experimental analyses found discrepancies by a few standard deviations from the su(3 ) values . since then , a number of methods have been used in order to improve the numerical predictions of coleman and glashow by including su(3 ) breaking effects . among these methods , heavy baryon chiral perturbation",
    "theory @xcite and the @xmath7 expansion of qcd @xcite , where @xmath0 is the number of colors , have been two schemes to understand the low - energy consequences of hadrons .    as a matter of fact",
    ", the combined use of chiral perturbation theory and the @xmath7 expansion is another calculational scheme which constrains the low - energy interactions of baryons with with the meson nonet limit the @xmath8 meson is related to the usual octet mesons @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 . ] in a more effective way than each method alone @xcite .",
    "let us recall that in the chiral limit @xmath12 and mesons become massless goldstone boson states ; as a result , there is an expansion in powers of @xmath13 , where @xmath14 gev is the scale of chiral symmetry breaking . on the other hand , in the large-@xmath0 limit , decuplet and octet baryons become degenerate , namely @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the su(3 ) invariant masses of the decuplet and octet baryon multiplets , respectively .",
    "it turns out that decuplet and octet baryon states constitute a single irreducible representation of the contracted spin - flavor symmetry of baryons in large-@xmath0 qcd @xcite .",
    "corrections about the large-@xmath0 limit then appear in powers of @xmath7 .",
    "all in all , the combined expansion in @xmath13 and @xmath7 requires to consider the double limit @xmath12 and @xmath18 .",
    "caldi and pagels @xcite , in the framework of chiral perturbation theory , found that corrections to baryon magnetic moments appear in the non - analytic forms @xmath1 and @xmath19 , which can be obtained from meson - loop graphs . in heavy baryon chiral perturbation",
    "theory @xcite , loop graphs have a calculable dependence on the ratio @xmath20 , where @xmath21 denotes the mass of meson @xmath22 .",
    "in order for the theory to be valid , the conditions @xmath23 and @xmath24 must be met , although the ratio @xmath20 is not constrained and can take any value @xcite .    in a previous paper @xcite we computed one - loop corrections to baryon magnetic moments within a combined expansion in @xmath25 and @xmath7 .",
    "we considered contributions of orders @xmath26 and @xmath27 to relative order @xmath28 in the @xmath7 expansion .",
    "the best way of approaching this problem was in the degeneracy limit @xmath29 .",
    "the resultant theoretical expressions agreed , order by order , with others obtained within baryon chiral perturbation theory @xcite for octet and decuplet baryons and also for octet - octet and decuplet - octet transitions .",
    "additionally , a comparison with the current experimental data @xcite through a least - squares fit allowed us to get information about the free parameters of the theory .",
    "although the predicted values obtained for all 27 possible magnetic moments were according to expectations , the fit somehow seemed to be not entirely satisfactory in the sense that the su(3 ) invariants of chiral perturbation theory are not well reproduced in our approach .",
    "it would be desirable to relax the restriction @xmath30 and consider the more realistic case @xmath31 .",
    "indeed , in the present paper we do so as a second approximation in the contributions arising from loop graphs of order @xmath26 _ only _ ; we thus postpone the study of contributions of order @xmath27 for a future work @xcite .",
    "our motivation here is not really to be definitive about the determination of baryon magnetic moments in the combined scheme but rather to explore the effects @xmath32 has on the fit to experimental data .",
    "any noticeably improvements should be observed in the best - fit values of the parameters in the fit and also in the value of @xmath33 .",
    "this paper is organized ad follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mm ] , apart from introducing our notation and conventions , we also provide an overview on the determination of baryon magnetic moments in large-@xmath0 chiral perturbation theory .",
    "we start our discussion by defining the tree - level values and then , in sec .",
    "[ sec:1l ] , we continue with getting one loop corrections . specifically , we concentrate on corrections of order @xmath26 by constructing the baryon operator which describes such contribution ; the dependence on @xmath34 is manifest at this level .",
    "we proceed further in order to achieve the reduction of this operator in the two flavor representations involved .",
    "the theoretical expressions obtained are thus compared with other determinations in the frame of chiral perturbation theory . in sec .",
    "[ sec : num ] we carry out a least - squares fit in order to determine the best - fit parameters of the theory which allow us to predict numerical values of the unobserved magnetic moments ; we then compare them with other numerical predictions . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : final ] we discuss our findings .",
    "this work is complemented by appendix [ app : reduc ] where we provide the reduction of the baryon operators to the order in @xmath7 discussed here .",
    "the present analysis builds on earlier works , particularly on refs .",
    "@xcite which established the mathematical groundwork on large-@xmath0 qcd and the @xmath7 expansion for baryons , and also on ref .",
    "@xcite , where baryon magnetic moments in large-@xmath0 chiral perturbation theory in the degeneracy limit were discussed .",
    "thus , we only give an outline of some relevant issues here .",
    "the starting point of the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite relies on the fact that , in the large-@xmath0 limit , the baryon magnetic moments possess the same kinematical properties as the baryon axial - vector couplings so they are described in terms of the same operators .",
    "the @xmath7 expansion of the baryon axial vector operator @xmath35 , at the physical value @xmath3 , can be written as @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are unknown coefficients not determined by the theory and @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 are the baryon spin , flavor and spin - flavor generators of the contracted spin - flavor symmetry su(6 ) .",
    "successive higher order operators are obtained from the previous ones as @xmath45 and @xmath46 for @xmath47 . besides , @xmath48 are diagonal operators with non - vanishing matrix elements only between states with the same spin whereas @xmath49 are purely off - diagonal operators with non - vanishing matrix elements only between states with different spin .",
    "now , in a complete analogy to expression ( [ eq : akc ] ) , the @xmath7 expansion of the operator which yields baryon magnetic moments can be written as @xcite @xmath50 where the series has also been truncated at @xmath3 .",
    "the magnetic moments are proportional to the quark charge matrix @xmath51 , so they can be separated into isovector and isoscalar components , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "thus , the baryon magnetic moment operator can be defined as @xmath54 hereafter , the spin index @xmath55 of @xmath56 will be set to 3 whereas the flavor index @xmath57 will stand for @xmath58 so any operator of the form @xmath59 should be understood as @xmath60 .",
    "the baryon magnetic and transition magnetic moments at tree level can be straightforwardly computed from eq .",
    "( [ eq : mmsep ] ) .",
    "the required matrix elements of the operators involved in such an expression are listed in ref .",
    "@xcite and will not be repeated here .",
    "let us now proceed to discuss the leading one - loop corrections .",
    "the one - loop diagrams that contribute to baryon magnetic moments are displayed in figs .",

    "@xcite was carried out in the degeneracy limit @xmath29 .",
    "we now intend to find out the effects @xmath32 has on the leading order corrections @xmath26 and also on the overall fit to the experimental data .",
    "however , the calculation involving a non - vanishing @xmath34 introduces a number of issues not discussed in ref .",
    "first , one can discern that an immediate modification can be found in the baryon propagator in the loop integral of fig .",
    "[ fig : mmloop1 ] , which now has an explicit dependence on @xmath34 . in order to deal with this issue",
    ", we can follow the approach implemented in the analysis of flavor @xmath62 nonanalytic corrections to the baryon masses presented in ref .  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "is was stated that in the chiral limit the baryon propagator is diagonal in spin so it can be expressed as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a spin projector operator for spin @xmath65 , which satisfies by definition    [ eq : spr ] @xmath66    and @xmath67 stands for the difference of the hyperfine mass splitting for spin @xmath65 and the external baryon , namely , @xmath68 the hyperfine mass splitting originates from the @xmath7 expansion of the baryon mass operator @xmath69 which transforms as a @xmath70 under @xmath71 .",

    "@xmath7 in the @xmath7 expansion .    a realization of @xmath64 is given by @xcite @xmath78 _ i.e. _",
    ", the projection operators for spin @xmath79 is given by the product over all @xmath80 not equal to @xmath79 .",
    "the general form of the spin projector ( [ eq : fullpr ] ) for arbitrary @xmath0 can be found in ref .",

    "the final analytical expressions were compared with the experimental data @xcite through a least - squares fit and also crosschecked with other calculations within the @xmath7 expansion @xcite and chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
