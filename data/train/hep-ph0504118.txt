    "the einstein - hilbert(eh ) action @xmath0\\,,\\ ] ] is the basis for general relativity(gr ) in 4d as well as the add@xcite and rs@xcite models in extra dimensions .",
    "as is well known eh is at best an effective action below the scale @xmath1 . as energies approaching @xmath1",
    "are reached additional terms may be generated in the effective action arising from the uv - completion of gr , , string theory .",
    "if @xmath1 is not far above the tev scale then these additional terms may make their presence known at future colliders : the lhc and ilc . from a bottom - up point of view",
    "it is not so clear what form such terms might take as the number of possibilities is vast and so we need some guidance .",
    "if we require that the new terms do not produce ghosts in the graviton sector , allow unitarity to be maintained and are ` string - motivated ' , we arrive at a rather unique set of terms called lovelock invariants@xcite .",
    "these lovelock invariants come in fixed order , @xmath2 , which we denote here as @xmath3 , that describes the number of powers of the curvature tensor , contracted in various ways , out of which they are constructed . apart from normalization factors",
    "we can express the @xmath3 as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the totally antisymmetric product of kronecker deltas and @xmath6 is the @xmath7-dimensional curvature tensor .",
    "fortunately , as can be seen by this definition , the number of such invariants that can exist in any given dimension @xmath8 is highly constrained . for a space with an even number of dimensions , @xmath9 ,",
    "the lovelock invariant is a topological one and leads to a total derivative , , a surface term , in the action .",
    "all of the higher order invariants , @xmath10 , vanish identically . for @xmath11 ,",
    "the @xmath3 are dynamical objects that once added the action can alter the field equations normally associated with the eh term",
    ". however it can be shown that the addition of any or all of the @xmath3 to the eh action still results in a theory with only second order equations of motion as is the case for ordinary einstein gravity .",
    "furthermore , variation of the new action leads to modifications of einstein s equations by the addition of new terms which are second - rank symmetric tensors with vanishing covariant derivatives and which depend only on the metric and its first and second derivatives , , they have the same general properties as the einstein tensor itself but are higher order in the curvature .",
    "it is these benign properties which provide the lovelock invariants their unique features .    from the discussion above we see that the most general lovelock theory in 4-d is just eh ! in 5-d , as in the rs case , all of the @xmath12 vanish as in 4-d but @xmath13 , which is the gauss - bonnet invariant , can now contribute .",
    "the generalization is now quite clear : for @xmath14 only @xmath15 can be present . for @xmath16",
    "only @xmath17 can be present while for @xmath18 only @xmath19 .",
    "since the add model assumes that the compactified space is flat , , a toroidal compactification is assumed , the coefficient of @xmath20 is taken to be zero in this case .",
    "thus for either the rs or add models , there are at most three new pieces to add to the eh action and so the generalized form of the action can be taken to be @xmath21-\\lambda\\bigg)\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are dimensionless coefficients .",
    "explicit expressions for the @xmath3 are given elsewhere@xcite .",
    "how do these new terms modify the usual rs and add model expectations ?",
    "let us turn to the rs case first where only the parameter @xmath22 can be non - zero . in this case a non - zero @xmath22 will make its presence known by distorting the masses and couplings of the graviton spectrum .",
    "recall that traditional rs model is based on the @xmath25 orbifold with the metric @xmath26 with @xmath27 defining the curvature parameter @xmath28 .",
    "there are two branes , separated by a distance @xmath29 , at the orbifold fixed points with the sm living on one of them(the tev brane ) with only gravity in the bulk .",
    "the influence of a non - zero @xmath22 on the phenomenology of this model is correlated with the fact that the space between the two branes has a large constant curvature , , it is @xmath30 .",
    "the effects of a non - zero @xmath22 are found to always occur in the combination @xmath31 , explicitly showing the influence of this curvature .",
    "since the ratio @xmath32 is usually taken to be small(to avoid large curvature ! )",
    "this damps the effects of the lovelock terms to some extent .    defining the useful combination",
    "@xmath33 it can be shown that @xmath34 is required to forbid tachyons in the kaluza - klein(kk ) graviton spectrum ; this forces @xmath35 .",
    "one finds that @xmath36 causes a shift in the usual rs mass spectrum , , the mass splitting between kk resonances increases , and induces a level dependence in the kk couplings to sm matter on the tev brane by altering the boundary conditions on these two branes .",
    "we find that the interaction of the kk graviton excitations with the sm fields on the tev brane is now given by @xmath37^{1/2 } h^{\\mu\\nu}_n t_{\\mu\\nu}\\,,\\ ] ] where as usual we define @xmath38 ; the kk masses are given as usual by @xmath39 with the @xmath40 being the roots of an equation involving bessel functions .",

    "[ fig2 ] . the value of @xmath47 ( and hence @xmath22 ) can be precisely determined at the ilc provided at least the first 2 kk excitations are kinematically accessible ; this can be done by measurements of ratios of the masses and widths of these two states@xcite which depends only upon @xmath47 .",
    "it is likely that such measurements will be sensitive to @xmath48 or better .",
    "we also see that the kk states now get even more narrow as one moves up the kk tower .     as functions of the parameter @xmath47 .",
    "note that in the rs limit all states have the same coupling .",

    "now let us turn our attention to the add case .",
    "since both the bulk and brane are flat in this case higher curvature terms do not quantitatively modify the usual two signatures of add@xcite : missing energy from graviton emission and new dimension-8 contact interaction operators from kk exchange .",
    "all of the usual add relationships , such as @xmath50 , together with the kk graviton mass spectrum and couplings are left completely unaltered by the higher curvature terms .",
    "the presence of lovelock terms in the action will never be probed by observables associated with such processes .",
    "the last add signature is tev - scale black hole(bh)@xcite production ; here we might expect some modifications as the region of space near bh are highly curved .",
    "we remind the reader that bh are expected to form in the collision of two partons once energies above @xmath51 are reached with a cross section given by @xmath52 , where here @xmath53 is the d - dimensional schwartzschild radius corresponding to the value of @xmath54 ; note the unphysical step function turn - on .",
    "this cross section does not correctly model the turn on of bh production but assumes that it starts immediately once @xmath1 is reached .",
    "once formed , the bh , now described by a temperature @xmath55 , should decay rapidly by hawking radiation into a number of sm particles .",
    "the presence of lovelock terms in the action alters the usual relationships between the bh mass , radius and temperature , , allowing for lovelock terms , @xmath53 is obtained by solving @xmath56\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 and @xmath58 is a constant given by @xmath59 .",
    "other bh properties are also modified by the lovelock parameters as we will discuss below .",
    "the influence of a non - zero @xmath22 on @xmath53 and @xmath55 are explicitly shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . here",
    "we see that o(1 ) corrections to the usual bh quantities are possible for non - zero @xmath22 . _",
    "if _ we think of the lovelock terms as arising from a perturbative - like expansion of the full action , as in string theory , the coefficients must grow smaller for the higher order terms .",
    "when we examine the expressions above we see that for a perturbative expansion to make sense we must have all of @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "since @xmath62 can be as large as 6 within the usual add scenario we might expect that @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 with wide margins allowed for errors in these estimates . in the add case",
    "we will assume that the lovelock parameters are positive quantities .     on the bh mass - schwarzschild radius(left ) and temperature(right ) relationship for @xmath66 and 20 , corresponding to the red , green , blue and magenta sets of curves , respectively .",

    "in fact one can show that a threshold behavior occurs , , for @xmath71 , unless @xmath72 no bh horizon forms ; for @xmath73 the threshold occurs at @xmath74 .",
    "furthermore , for values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 in the ` natural ' ranges discussed above this tells us that bh will not form below a critical center of mass energy at a collider .",
    "the value of this mass threshold as well as the shape of the bh production cross section immediately above threshold are determined solely by the lovelock parameters .     with @xmath75 and @xmath76 since @xmath77 vanishes when @xmath78.,title=\"fig:\",width=215 ]   with @xmath75 and @xmath76 since @xmath77 vanishes when @xmath78.,title=\"fig:\",width=215 ]    these threshold shapes can be measured at the lhc as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] but precision measurements will require the ilc .",
    "it is important to notice that in both cases the cross sections are quite large @xmath79 pb which may yield up to @xmath80 events so that there is no shortage of available statistics .",
    "we note that asymptotically , far above threshold , the cross section we obtain becomes those of the simple step function model .",

    "in this note we have briefly summarized the influence of higher - order lovelock curvature terms on the phenomenology of the familiar rs and add models . in the case of rs model",
    "the dominant effect is a modification to the kaluza - klein graviton mass spectrum and their associated couplings to matter on the tev brane .",
    "the mass spacing between the kk states increases , their couplings become kk level dependent and weaker in overall strength . since kk masses and widths can be measured with very high precision at the ilc given sufficient center of mass energy , the value of the single possibly non - zero lovelock parameter in this case should be well determined .    in the case of the add model the modifications are quite different .",
    "first , the usual add signatures , , missing energy and dimension-8 contact interactions , remain unaltered at the quantitative level .",
