    "nuclear spin isomers of symmetrical molecules are fascinating objects @xcite .",
    "their properties are determined by nuclei spins deeply hidden in the molecule .",
    "most known are the hydrogen isomers that demonstrate anomalous stability , 1 year at ambient temperature and pressure @xcite .",
    "latest results on hydrogen isomers can be found in @xcite and references therein .",
    "many other molecules have spin isomers too .",
    "but so far their physical properties remain almost unknown .",
    "this makes investigations of spin isomers fundamentally important .",
    "spin isomers have also practical applications , e.g. , as spin labels , in isomer selective chemical reactions @xcite , or in isomer enhanced nmr technique @xcite .",
    "these applications are developed solely with hydrogen isomers .",
    "extension to other molecules needs efficient methods of isomer enrichment . for a long time enrichment of only hydrogen isomers",
    "was possible .",
    "recently a few separation methods for polyatomic molecules have been developed ( see the review @xcite ) that has advanced the field significantly .",
    "further progress needs new enrichment methods .",
    "new approach to the problem of isomer enrichment is based on the use of strong electromagnetic radiation .",
    "there are two modifications of the method . in the first one @xcite",
    "( earlier discussion of the radiation effects see in @xcite ) , radiation populates specific states of one spin isomer situated in the vicinity of states of other isomer that consequently results in the enrichment . in the second method @xcite",
    ", enrichment appears due to combined action of population transfer , dynamical shift of molecular levels and light induced coherence . the latter method ( coherent control of spin isomers )",
    "promises to be more efficient . to avoid any confusion",
    ", we note that the light - induced enrichment resulting from stimulating conversion of spin species differs radically from the previously known separation methods , e.g. , light - induced drift method which separates physically the isomers @xcite .",
    "there are no proofs yet that light - induced enrichment of spin isomers is feasible .",
    "we are aware of only one attempt to verify the proposals .",
    "it was done by microwave excitation of rotational transition in ch@xmath2f .",
    "the experiment did not give a positive result . at the time when this experiment was performed ,",
    "only a qualitative theoretical model of the light - induced enrichment was available @xcite .",
    "presently , the understanding of the underlying physics has been improved substantially . in view of further experiments in this area",
    "it is desirable to examine the microwave induced enrichment of ch@xmath2f spin isomers in more detail .",
    "this is the goal of the present paper .",
    "existing theoretical models of coherent control can not be used for quantitative analysis directly because of their lacking to account the @xmath0-degeneracy of molecular states .",
    "account of such degeneracy is another goal of this paper .",
    "previous analysis has shown that significant enrichment can be obtained if radiation interacts with the states having large difference in populations . in this context ,",
    "microwave excitation is not the best option but it has some advantages also .",
    "theoretical description is simpler for pure rotational excitation .",
    "the levels positions are better known for ground vibrational states . from the experimental side ,",
    "it is easier to find a radiation having proper frequency because of better frequency tunability of microwave sources .",
    "we start with brief qualitative description of the phenomenon . ch@xmath2f has two types of states , ortho and para , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . the data in this figure correspond to the @xmath1ch@xmath2f molecule and have been calculated using the molecular parameters from @xcite .",
    "spin isomers of ch@xmath2f are distinguished by the total spin of the three hydrogen nuclei , @xmath5 for ortho and @xmath6 for para isomers . for ortho isomers only rotational quantum numbers",
    "@xmath7 are allowed ( @xmath4 is the projection of molecular angular momentum , * j * , on the molecular symmetry axis . ) for para molecules only @xmath8 are allowed @xcite .",
    "there are two close pairs of ortho and para states in the ground vibrational state of @xmath1ch@xmath2f that are significantly mixed by the intramolecular perturbation , @xmath9 , and that are important for the ortho - para conversion in the molecule . for a qualitative description ,",
    "let us take into account only one of these pairs , @xmath10 , and assume that there is no external radiation yet .",
    "suppose that the test molecule is placed into the ortho subspace .",
    "due to the rotational relaxation caused by collisions , the molecule starts to shuttle up and down along the ladder of rotational states .",
    "nonmagnetic collisions do not change the nuclear spin state directly , i.e. , the relevant cross - section is zero , @xmath11 .",
    "this shuttling along the rotational states inside the ortho subspace continues until the molecule jumps to the state @xmath12 . during the free flight after that collision the intramolecular perturbation , @xmath9 ,",
    "admixes the para states @xmath13 to the ortho state @xmath12 .",
    "consequently , the next collision has a probability ( usually very small ) to transfer the molecule to other para states .",
    "this localizes the molecule inside the para subspace and the spin conversion occurs .",
    "this is the mechanism of radiation free nuclear spin conversion induced by the intramolecular state mixing @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .    in case of a strong microwave radiation applied to the molecular transition @xmath14 in the para subspace , mixing of the states",
    "is affected by the radiation which allows to control the ortho - para conversion .",
    "influence of a radiation comes through the three major effects , level shift ( dynamical stark effect , well - known in nonlinear laser spectroscopy @xcite ) , level population change , and light - induced coherence .",
    "in general , these three components can not be separated and work together .",
    "in order to consider a real molecule , the above simplified picture has to be developed further .",
    "one has to account the molecular center - of - mass motion .",
    "although the intramolecular mixing does not depend on molecular velocity , the radiation - molecular interaction does .",
    "consequently , the ortho - para state mixing in coherent control depends on molecular velocity too .",
    "another complication comes from the degeneracy of molecular states .",
    "even for the simplest case of pure radiation polarization ( linear or circular ) there are many excitation channels each having its own absorption coefficient and saturation parameter .",
    "these channels differ by @xmath0-quantum number , projection of * j * on the laboratory axis of quantization .",
    "it is important also to keep in mind that there are other degeneracies of states .",
    "each state of @xmath1ch@xmath2f in fig .",

    "the energy of rotational states of ch@xmath2f depends only on @xmath3 and @xmath4 quantum numbers , if tiny hyperfine contribution to the level energy is neglected .",

    "solution of the kinetic equation ( [ drp1 ] ) can be presented as , @xmath178 where @xmath179 and @xmath180 are the steady - state and initial ( equilibrium ) concentrations of para molecules , respectively .",
    "enrichment of para molecules will be defined as , @xmath181 partition functions for ortho and para isomers of ch@xmath2f are equal .",
    "consequently , @xmath182 , @xmath183 and enrichment , @xmath184 , can be expressed as , @xmath185 which will be used for the numerical calculations of @xmath184 .",
    "one can note from eq .",
    "( [ bg ] ) that despite the rates @xmath135 and @xmath137 have rather large field dependent parts ( see fig .",
    "( [ fig5 ] ) ) , they alone would not produce an enrichment .",
    "it can be understood because these field dependent parts are due to the mixing of states shifted by radiation but having equilibrium populations ( see eq .  ( [ g ] ) ) .",
    "conversion through the mixing of equilibrium populated states does not affect the ortho - to - para ratio .",
    "examples of the enrichment @xmath184 are given in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . at the pressure 30  mtorr and radiation intensity @xmath106  mw/@xmath91 ,",
    "enrichment peak at @xmath146 is @xmath1743% and it is @xmath1744 times higher than the enrichment at @xmath147 . at larger radiation intensity , amplitude of the enrichment peak , @xmath186 , saturates at @xmath1745% .",
    "the peak at @xmath147 grows to @xmath1741% .    the simplified model that accounts only the radiation - induced level population change predicts a factor two higher peak at @xmath147 than the present model .",
    "as was discussed above , in the present model one has partial cancellation of contributions originated from the rates @xmath140 and @xmath142 which results in a smaller enrichment .",
    "another significant difference between these models is that the simplified model does not predict an enrichment at @xmath146 .",
    "broadening of the two peaks in enrichment is very distinctive and is similar to the peaks of conversion rate , although there is some difference .",
    "the enrichment peak at @xmath146 is broader than the peak of @xmath173 because of large @xmath135 and @xmath137 at resonant frequency in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ bg ] ) .",
    "we have developed a model of spin isomer coherent control that accounts for the molecular level degeneracy in magnetic quantum numbers .",
    "this degeneracy together with the account of molecular center - of - mass motion allow now to apply the model to real molecules , having actual level structure and ortho - para mixing hamiltonian .",
    "the developed model was used to analyse the microwave induced enrichment of spin isomers in @xmath1ch@xmath2f .",
    "spectrum of the conversion rate consists of two peaks with the peak at @xmath146 being two orders of magnitude higher than the peak at @xmath147 .",
    "the enrichment spectrum has also two peaks at the same frequencies .",
    "one can obtain 3% enrichment using forbidden ( for ordinary absorption ) resonance at @xmath146 , gas pressure 30  mtorr at room temperature and radiation intensity @xmath106  mw/@xmath91 .",
    "amplitude of the peak at @xmath147 is 4 times smaller .",
    "cooling the gas to 200  k would increase enrichment to @xmath1745% because of the increase of the level population difference . at higher radiation intensity enrichment saturates at @xmath1745% if the gas temperature @xmath187  k and at @xmath1747% if @xmath188  k.    for the practical implementation of the microwave enrichment , the use of the peak at @xmath146 has a few advantages .",
    "enrichment here is significantly larger than at @xmath147 .",
    "moreover , spurious effects can decrease the enrichment at @xmath147 even further .",
    "it can be due to the gas heating by radiation .",
    "note , that for the peak at @xmath146 absorption is negligible and there is no gas heating .",
    "another spurious affect may be due to the resonant exchange of rotational quanta between ortho and para isomers .",
    "this effect prevents depopulation of one rotational state by radiation ( state @xmath13 in our case ) in comparison with the population of the state @xmath12 having nearly equal energy .",
    "again , the peak at @xmath146 has the advantage of very low absorption coefficient and thus low radiation induced population change . finally , the disadvantage of the peak at @xmath147 is the spurious absorption by the line @xmath189 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "although at low pressures this line is well separated from the line @xmath101 ( the gap is 10  mhz ) , power broadening partially overlap these lines . on other hand ,",
    "the peak @xmath146 is situated at the blue side of the line @xmath189 being 120  mhz away from the nearest absorption line ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "enrichment obtained by microwave excitation of @xmath1ch@xmath2f at reasonable experimental conditions is not large , @xmath1743% . on the other hand , there are some applications where such enrichment could be significant , e.g. , in spin isomer enhanced nmr technique @xcite .",
    "note that for the standard 200 mhz nmr the difference in boltzmann factors between zeeman states , which determines the amplitude of nmr signal , is only @xmath190 .",
    "if even a fraction of the 3% isomer enrichment would be transported to the zeeman level populations it would enhance the nmr signal significantly .",
    "apart from any possible applications of microwave enrichment , which is by far too early to discuss now , observation of the microwave enrichment would have prove - of - principle importance for the coherent control of spin isomers .",
    "it is interesting to note also that the isomer enrichment at @xmath146 would demonstrate an example of enhanced access to weak processes in molecules through the isomer enrichment @xcite .",
    "suppose , one would like to measure the absorption at @xmath146 directly . at the conditions considered in the paper , @xmath191  cm@xmath93 which is rather difficult to measure .",
    "this value has to be compared with the 3% enrichment in the coherent control which should not be difficult to measure .",
