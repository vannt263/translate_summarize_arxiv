    "soft @xmath0-ray repeaters ( sgrs ) emit short - duration ( @xmath2 seconds ) bursts of soft @xmath0- and hard x - rays .",
    "they are believed to be magnetars , neutron stars with long periods of a few seconds and dipole fields of @xmath3 gauss ( thompson & duncan 1995 ; woods & thompson 2004 for a recent review ) .",
    "only three giant flares from sgrs have been detected so far , the brightest of which originated from sgr1806 - 20 on 2004 december 27 ( hurley et al .",
    "2005 ; palmer et al . 2005 ; mazets et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the follow - up observations of the december 27 event revealed a bright radio afterglow with the size , proper motion , polarization , and flux at different radio frequencies all evolving with time ( gaensler et al .",
    "2005 ; cameron et al .",
    "2005 ; gelfand et al .",
    "2005 ; taylor et al .",
    "an obvious break in the multi - frequency light curves of the afterglow occurred around day 9 after the burst and subsequently the flux declined rapidly as @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 ) between days 10 and 25 .",
    "but the afterglow hardly faded during the period of days 2533 .",
    "in fact it underwent a slower decay .",
    "the observed temporal evolution of the source size was @xmath6 on days 7 to 10 ( cameron et al .",
    "this was followed by a faster increase ( taylor et al .",
    "2005 ; also see granot et al .",
    "the proper motion of the afterglow on days 717 was negligible but subsequently became significant ( taylor et al .",
    "in addition , the spectrum is generally consistent with a single power law index ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "cameron et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found @xmath8 on day 7 and then the spectrum steepened from @xmath9 on day 15 to @xmath10 .",
    "two different models have been proposed to explain these observational results . in wang et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , we considered an initially relativistic energetic blast wave from the december 27 giant flare , following the suggestion that relativistic fireballs may occur in sgr bursts ( huang , dai & lu 1998 ; thompson & duncan 2001 ) .",
    "this is , in principle , the same mechanism established for grb afterglows ( mszros & rees 1997 ; sari , piran & narayan 1998 ) , i.e. the emission from a relativistically expanding blast wave that forms when the outflow from the sgr sweeps up the surrounding interstellar medium . to explain the light - curve break around day 9",
    ", we invoked a broken power - law distribution of the shock - accelerated electrons .",
    "this model appears to explain the rapid fading of the afterglow but can not account for the rebrightening starting on day 25 and peaking on day 33 .    realizing this difficulty , some authors ( gaensler et al . 2005 ; cameron et al . 2005 ; gelfand et al .",
    "2005 ; granot et al .",
    "2005 ) proposed a subrelativistic outflow model , in which the outflow from the giant flare initially expanded in a cavity at a constant velocity of @xmath11 and about 7 days later it happened to collide with a thin shell , which led to its deceleration by a reverse shock while the ambient matter was accelerated by a forward shock . in this model ,",
    "the rapid decline of the afterglow flux was caused by adiabatic expansion of the reversely - shocked electrons and the rebrightening was due to initial coasting and subsequent deceleration of the outflow .",
    "this model predicts a size @xmath12 in the coasting phase , which is inconsistent with the observations of cameron et al .",
    "furthermore , one has to assume an unobserved density bump to ignite the fireball right before the observations started .",
    "it is unclear whether this could happen and what could be the source of the density bump    the idea of an initially subrelativistic blast wave from sgrs was suggested by cheng & wang ( 2003 ) , who explained the radio afterglow light curve of the 1998 august 27 giant flare from sgr1900 + 14 . for this event ,",
    "a rebrightening could be seen although the data were sparse ( frail et al . 1999 ) . in this _ letter _ , we propose a two - component explosion model to interpret the abundant observational data for the december 27 event . in this model ,",
    "one relativistic collimated outflow is responsible for the initial giant flare and the early afterglow , and another subrelativistic wider outflow is responsible for the late afterglow .",
    "our model seems to provide a unified picture in understanding the two giant flares and their radio afterglows from sgrs . in  2 ,",
    "we discuss why two components are needed for the giant flares and radio afterglows , and in  3 , we fit the observed light curves at 4.86 ghz and 8.46 ghz and the source size as a function of time . in  4 , we summarize our results .",
    "within the framework of the magnetar model , thompson & duncan ( 2001 ) proposed a triggering mechanism for giant flares , in which a helical distortion of the core magnetic field induces a large - scale cracking of the crust and a twisting deformation of the exterior magnetic field .",
    "this mechanism is consistent with the three observed timescales in the december 27 giant flare ( schwartz et al .",
    "it seems that the energy release for this mechanism includes two components .",
    "first , as the crust cracks , the exterior magnetic field deforms , which leads to a purely magnetohydrodynamic instability .",
    "such an instability probably produces reconnection events and induces magnetohydrodynamic waves outside the star .",
    "the dissipated wave energy is initially locked onto the magnetic field in a thermal photon - pair plasma , which , under its own huge pressure , expands adiabatically along some surface magnetic lines and eventually drives a relativistic collimated outflow because of very low baryon loading .",
    "second , when the core  toroidal \" magnetic field floats up to break through the stellar crust , reconnection of the newborn surface magnetic field will drive an explosive outflow ( kluniak & ruderman 1998 ; dai & lu 1998 ) .",
    "because this magnetic field inevitably brings some crustal matter and the reconnection occurs at about the stellar radius , the resultant outflow has high baryon contamination and thus it is subrelativistic .",
    "alternatively , even if only one exterior magnetic - reconnection event associated with the giant flare happens within the region whose size is less than the stellar radius above the surface ( otherwise the energy release is too small to power the observed giant flare , because the dipole magnetic field steeply decreases with increasing radius , i.e. , @xmath13 ) , the outward photon - pair flow launches a collimated outflow with very low baryon loading , as discussed above for a relativistic component . in the meantime , the inward emission impinges on the stellar surface , and its part is reflected back and re - emitted from a larger solid angle with much heavier baryon loading from the surface as a subrelativistic component .",
    "we now discuss why two components are needed to interpret the observational data .",
    "we consider a @xmath0-ray energy release of the december 27 burst , @xmath14 ergs , near the surface of a magnetar with radius of @xmath15 cm in a time of @xmath16 s , and thus the outflow luminosity is at least @xmath17 , as implied by the observed hard spike ( hurley et al .",
    "an extremely large optical depth means a radiation - pair outflow with an initial temperature of @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the stephan - boltzmann constant .",
    "assuming the baryon loading rate of the outflow , @xmath22 , we define a dimensionless entropy @xmath23 .",
    "if @xmath24 , this outflow will expand relativistically as the lorentz factor @xmath25 and the temperature @xmath26 ( shemi & piran 1990 ) .",
    "the temperature , lorentz factor and radiation luminosity at the photosphere become @xmath27 $ ] , @xmath28 $ ] , and @xmath29 $ ] respectively , where @xmath30^{1/4}\\simeq 100l_{0,47}^{1/4}r_{0,6}^{-1/4}$ ] ( mszros & rees 2000 ) . as suggested by nakar , piran & sari ( 2005 ) and ioka et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , the giant flare might have arisen from the emission at the photosphere and/or internal shocks if the outflow is variable .",
    "the observed average temperature of the hard spike , @xmath31 kev ( hurley et al . 2005 ) , requires @xmath32 .",
    "if @xmath33 , the outflow will also expand under its own pressure , which includes the gas pressure and radiation pressure , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the proton number density at radius @xmath36 .",
    "letting @xmath37 at radius @xmath38 , we define the critical baryon loading rate , @xmath39 .",
    "if the baryon loading rate is below @xmath40 , the radiation pressure exceeds the gas pressure so that the temperature decays @xmath26 . in this case",
    ", the temperature and radiation luminosity at the photosphere decreases to @xmath41 and @xmath42 where the photospheric radius @xmath43 cm with @xmath44 .",
    "if the baryon loading rate exceeds @xmath40 , the gas pressure dominates over the radiative pressure and the temperature decays as @xmath45 . in this case , the temperature and radiation luminosity at the photosphere are @xmath46 and @xmath47 thus , the temperature and luminosity of the emission from the subrelativistic outflow at the photosphere in both cases are much less than those of the giant flare , showing that a subrelativistic outflow model for explaining the giant flare can be ruled out .    therefore , we conclude that an ultrarelativistic outflow is required by the extremely high peak luminosity with millions of the eddington value , hard spectrum and rapid variability of the initial spike emission of the giant flares .",
    "furthermore , a relativistic jet model indeed provides a satisfactory explanation for the observed light curve of the initial spike of the december 27 giant flare , as shown by yamazaki et al .",
    "it is possible that such an outflow , after emitting the hard spike , retains some amount of energy and then drives a blast wave when sweeping into the ambient medium .",
    "on the other hand , an obvious bump at @xmath48 days in the 4.86 ghz light curve of the radio afterglow for the december 27 event and a possible bump at @xmath49 days for the august 27 event imply that subrelativistic outflows with initial velocities of @xmath50 could begin to be decelerated by the ambient medium with density of @xmath51 at @xmath52 .",
    "thus we obtain the outflow mass and kinetic energy @xmath53 and @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "this outflow could also drive a forward shock with negligible energy loss .    in short ,",
    "there could have been two blast waves after the december 27 giant flare . in the following",
    "we show that an initially relativistic shock is responsible for the early afterglow and a nonrelativistic shock for the late afterglow .",
    "we consider two energetic shocks after the december 27 giant flare : one initially ultrarelativistic blast wave with an opening angle of @xmath56 , an isotropic - equivalent energy of @xmath57 , and the lorentz factor @xmath58 , and another subrelativistic forward shock with an energy of @xmath59 and an initial velocity of @xmath60 .",
    "both shocks expand in a uniform medium with density of @xmath51 .",
    "the initially relativistic blast wave will enter the non - relativistic phase at @xmath61 and is expected to play a dominative role in the early radio afterglow , where @xmath62 . as suggested in wang et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , the electron energy distribution in this blast wave is taken to be a broken power - law form with @xmath63 and @xmath64 below and above the break lorentz factor @xmath65 during the trans - relativistic stage , @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the minimum lorentz factor .",
    "observationally , such an electron distribution is not only required by the spectral evolution of the afterglow ( cameron et al . 2005 ) and the synchrotron spectrum of the crab nebula ( amato et al .",
    "2000 ) but also suggested in fitting two gamma - ray burst afterglows ( li & chevalier 2001 ) and tev blazars ( tavecchio , maraschi & ghisellini 1998 ) . theoretically , the recent particle simulation of a relativistic two - stream instability by dieckmann ( 2005 ) revealed a broken power - law distribution .",
    "wang et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have shown that this distribution can account for the frequency - dependent breaks of the light curves around day 9 and the steepening of the radio - band spectra with time ( cameron et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the initially sub - relativistic component may largely contribute to the radio afterglow emission only at late times , as it is decelerated and the swept - up matter accumulates . according to this scenario , the observed bump time @xmath68 days corresponds to the deceleration time @xmath52 of this component ,",
    "so we infer @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the initial velocity of the sub - relativistic component and @xmath71 is the blast wave radius at the bump time .",
    "then we can constrain the isotropic - equivalent energy of this component from the deceleration time , i.e. , @xmath72 ergs ( from equation 7 ) . the electron energy distribution for this component",
    "is assumed to be a single power - law one with index @xmath73 .",
    "this is deduced from the spectrum form of the late radio afterglow of the 1998 august 27 giant flare from sgr 1900 + 14 .",
    "we first carried out numerical calculations of the dynamics of each blast wave based on huang et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and obtained the temporal evolution of the source s radius .",
    "we next calculated light curves of the synchrotron radiation from the shocked matter at different frequencies , assuming that the electron energy distribution has the same form as equation ( 8) and that @xmath74 and @xmath75 are fractions of the total energy density that go into the electrons and magnetic field respectively .",
    "combining the contributions from both components , we performed numerical fitting to the light curves at 4.86 ghz and 8.46 ghz in figures 1 and 2 respectively . in the fitting ,",
    "the physical parameter values are taken : @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 for the initially relativistic component , and @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 for the initially subrelativistic component .",
    "the other parameter values are @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 .",
    "we take the distance to the source , @xmath88 kpc ( cameron et al . 2005 ) , which is slightly less than used in previous works .",
    "our fitting gives the total @xmath89 for 11 physical parameters .",
    "the evolution of the source size with time was reported for the december 27 event ( gaensler et al .",
    "2005 ; cameron et al .",
    "2005 ; granot et al .",
    "2005 ; taylor et al . 2005 ) . for the two - component model ,",
    "the measured size at any time should be dominated by the brighter component . in figure 3",
    ", we present the evolution of the source sizes of the initially relativistic and subrelativistic components , denoted by the dashed and dotted lines , respectively . from the light curves in figure 2 , we see that the flux density of the initially subrelativistic component begins to dominate over that of the initially relativistic component around day 20 , so that the measured sizes should be the sizes of the initially relativistic and subrelativistic components before and after this time respectively .",
    "the solid line linking both components in figure 3 indicates the transition regime between the two phases .",
    "we have proposed a two - component explosion model , in which one initially relativistic collimated outflow can account for the spectrum of the giant flare and the early - time broken light curves at different radio frequencies and the slow increase of the source size , and another subrelativistic wider outflow for the late - time rebrightening of the radio afterglow and the faster increase of the source size .",
    "in addition , our model is consistent with the magnetar scenario of thompson & duncan ( 2001 ) . in this scenario",
    ", two magnetic reconnection events may happen near the surface and in the magnetosphere respectively , which give rise to a relativistic collimated outflow and a subrelativistic outflow because of different baryon loadings .",
    "alternatively , even if only one magnetic reconnection event associated with the giant flare happens within a small region above the surface , the outward photon - pair flow launches a relativistic collimated fireball while the inward flow strikes the surface and is partially re - emitted as a subrelativistic baryonic outflow from a larger solid angle .",
    "finally , the relativistic component from a giant flare like the december 27 event may be diagnosed using future high energy data , as noted by fan , zhang & wei ( 2005 ) .",
