    "magnetic resonance ( mr ) spectroscopic techniques are of primary importance in a variety of fields from physics to materials science , chemistry and biology . electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) spectroscopy enables characterisation of electronic systems in materials and systems containing unpaired electron spins , such as metal complexes and organic radicals ;",
    "whereas nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) spectroscopy probes nuclei with a non - zero spin , and is routinely used in chemical analysis of macromolecules .",
    "however , conventional epr and nmr methods require macroscopic samples composed of millions of spins , impeding their use in the investigation of nanoscale materials and processes . the nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) centre in diamond ( see @xcite for a review ) has been developed as a nanoscale magnetometer @xcite for the detection of static @xcite , oscillating @xcite and randomly fluctuating fields @xcite .",
    "recently , pathways towards nanoscale mr spectroscopy using the nv centre have been proposed and demonstrated @xcite .",
    "these techniques broadly fall into two classes : measurements based on the nv dephasing time ( @xmath2 ) and measurement of the nv relaxation time ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the first of these uses the nv centre to sense the oscillating field produced by sample spins non - resonantly coupled to the nv spin . in these techniques ,",
    "the dephasing rate ( @xmath3 ) of the nv spin is monitored in response to either continuous driving of the target spins using a resonant microwave field @xcite ; or by applying a frequency - selective dynamical - decoupling sequence to the nv probe spin in order to detect the larmor precession of the target spins @xcite . in both cases , it is possible to extract spectral information about the target environment , with sensitivity and spectral resolution governed by the nv centre s intrinsic dephasing rate .",
    "these dephasing - based techniques however have limitations .",
    "pulsed magnetic resonance techniques such as double electron electron resonance ( deer ) and electron - nuclear double resonance ( endor ) require the ability to magnetically drive the target spins , which poses a challenge for spins with short lifetimes or small gyromagnetic ratios @xcite .",
    "nmr spectroscopy via measurement of the larmor precession field requires the application of complex microwave pulse sequences .",
    "these are highly susceptible to pulsing errors and contain harmonic resonances away from the central interrogation frequency @xcite .",
    "moreover , all of these techniques have their interrogation times limited by the probe s @xmath2 dephasing time . for external spin detection , requiring high sensitivity , the reduction in @xmath2 as nv centres approach the diamond surface is a significant drawback which limits the number of spins that can be detected @xcite .    in this work",
    "we pursue the second type of nanoscale mr spectroscopy based on @xmath0 measurements .",
    "@xmath0-mr as a means of extracting the spectral distribution of the nanoscale environment was developed by hall et al . and demonstrated with an ensemble of nv probes @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-mr technique involves measuring the longitudinal relaxation rate ( @xmath4 ) of the nv probe as a function of a controlled static background field @xcite , causing the probe s rate of relaxation to increase as it is brought into resonance with target spin transitions @xcite .",
    "relaxometry - based @xmath0-mr has the potential to overcome a number of issues associated with @xmath2-based mr , by removing the need to pulse either the probe or target spin , as well as allowing the interrogation time to be extended from the dephasing timescale , @xmath2 , out to the relaxation timescale , @xmath0 , of the probe , which for near - surface nv spins can be up to three orders of magnitude longer than @xmath2 @xcite . here",
    "we extend this concept to a single spin probe , demonstrate the technique s broadband applicability , and uncover a new mechanism for detecting nmr transitions . using @xmath1n impurities within the diamond as a test system ,",
    "we show that this method allows probing of both epr and nmr transitions under ambient conditions while using a single spin probe , without requiring any microwave or radiofrequency driving .",
    "this allows us to extract information about the target system including hyperfine parameters , the nuclear quadrupole coupling parameter and the nuclear gyromagnetic ratio . in this experiment",
    ", the nmr transitions are occur via a two - step process involving hyperfine interaction and electron - electron interaction , which dramatically enhances the signal strength .",
    "in addition , we investigate theoretically the technique s potential to detect nmr transitions of single nuclear spins external to the diamond .",
    "we predict that spectroscopy at the single proton level is achievable under realistic conditions . with the prospect of further improving the sensitivity through materials optimisation",
    ", our approach constitutes a promising alternative to @xmath2-based techniques towards single - molecule nmr spectroscopy and imaging .",
    "this article is organised as follows .",
    "we first describe the general principle of the technique employed in this work ( sec .",
    "[ sec : principle ] ) . we then present experimental results of epr and nmr spectroscopy of @xmath1n impurities in diamond ( sec .",
    "[ sec : exp ] ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec : nmr ] , we extrapolate these results and consider theoretically the detection of single nuclear spins .",
    "further experimental details , as well as full theoretical methods , are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : methods ] .",
    "the schematic of the experimental setup is shown in fig .",
    "the probe spin is the electronic spin of an nv centre in diamond , which consists of a substitutional nitrogen adjacent to a vacancy @xcite .",
    "the experimental setup includes a scanning confocal microscope allowing the single nv probe to be addressed with a 532 nm laser , with emitted red photoluminescence ( pl ) then measured by an avalanche photodiode detector .",
    "a permanent magnet is attached to a three - axis scanning stage in order to vary the direction and strength of the applied magnetic field ( see further details about the setup in sec .",
    "[ sec : methods : setup ] ) .",
    "the nv centre s electronic ground state is a spin triplet with hamiltonian @xmath5 where @xmath6 is planck s constant , @xmath7 ghz / t is the gyromagnetic ratio of the nv electron spin @xcite , and @xmath8 ghz is the crystal field splitting . here",
    "@xmath9 refers to the spin-1 operator of the probe nv spin along the nv centre s symmetry axis , defined as the @xmath10 axis .",
    "the external magnetic field is aligned along @xmath10 with a strength @xmath11 .",
    "the eigenstates of the probe ( p ) spin are denoted as @xmath12 where @xmath13 refers to the spin projection along @xmath10 . in zero magnetic field ,",
    "the @xmath14 and @xmath15 states are split by a frequency @xmath16 ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) .",
    "due to this zero - field splitting , environmental spin species can be brought into resonance with the nv s ground state transitions via the zeeman effect .",
    "this is achieved by applying the appropriate static magnetic field along the nv symmetry axis ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]c ) .",
    "precisely , the nv spin transition @xmath17 correspond to a frequency @xmath18 .",
    "the transition frequency of a target ( electronic or nuclear ) spin can be generally expressed as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the gyromagnetic ratio of this particular spin and @xmath21 is its intrinsic splitting , which may include zero - field splittings , quadrupolar interactions , hyperfine interactions , or interactions with the local environment such as dipole couplings or chemical shifts .",
    "the nv - target resonance condition is @xmath22 from which one deduces the two resonant magnetic fields @xmath23 when this condition is fulfilled ( i.e. , @xmath24 ) , the nv and target spins can exchange energy through their mutual dipole - dipole interaction , which leads to an increased spin relaxation rate of both systems . thus , monitoring the spin relaxation time @xmath0 of the nv centre whilst varying the axial field strength @xmath11 , yields a @xmath0-mr spectrum exhibiting one or several resonant fields @xmath25 ( fig . [",
    "fig1]d ) corresponding to target spin transitions @xcite . for electronic spins ,",
    "the resonances are typically centred about @xmath26 g , corresponding to transition frequencies @xmath27 ghz . owing to their much smaller gyromagnetic ratio",
    ", nuclear spins will interact with the nv at fields @xmath28 g , close to the @xmath29 g ground state level anti - crossing of the nv centre ( gslac , fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) .",
    "this corresponds to transition frequencies ranging from a few mhz for an isolated nuclear spin with @xmath30 ( e.g. , a proton @xmath31h ) up to @xmath32 mhz in the presence of a hyperfine interaction with a nearby electron . by combining this with purely optical monitoring of the nv spin relaxation time @xmath0 @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]e ) , an all - optical , broadband , nanoscale mr spectrometer may be realised . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the technique was demonstrated using an ensemble of nv centres to obtain the epr spectrum of @xmath1n impurities in bulk diamond . in this work",
    "we extend the technique both to the single nv probe regime and from epr to low frequency nmr spectroscopy .",
    "to demonstrate the technique experimentally at the single nv level , we consider a target environment composed of @xmath1n substitutional donor impurities residing in the same diamond crystal as the nv probe .",
    "these defects ( usually referred to as p1 centres ) , when found in their uncharged state , comprise an electronic spin @xmath33 associated with an unpaired electron and a nuclear spin @xmath34 associated with the @xmath1n nucleus @xcite .",
    "this configuration allows us to investigate both electronic ( epr ) and nuclear ( nmr ) spin transitions , thereby demonstrating the broadband nature of the technique .",
    "our sample is a type - ib diamond from element six with a @xmath1n concentration specified to be @xmath35 ppm .",
    "the upper limit of 200 ppm corresponds to a median distance between an nv centre and the nearest p1 centre of @xmath36 nm .",
    "several individual nv centres were studied and gave consistent results .",
    "all measurements shown in the following have been obtained with the same nv centre , at room temperature .    to measure the @xmath0 time of the nv spin , a 3-@xmath37s laser pulse is applied to initialise the spin into @xmath38 , while a subsequent laser pulse reads out the spin state after a variable wait time @xmath39 ( see inset in fig . [",
    "this sequence is repeated many times while the time - resolved pl is monitored . the pl intensity immediately following the start of the pulse , the signal @xmath40 , is a measure of the population in the @xmath38 state @xcite , while the pl at the end of the pulse , @xmath41 , serves for normalisation purposes .",
    "the ratio @xmath42 therefore measures the decay out of @xmath38 after a time @xmath39 .",
    "a typical relaxation curve is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]e , which is well described by a single exponential decay @xmath43 .",
    "away from any resonance with environmental spins , the characteristic decay time is typically @xmath44 ms , governed by two - phonon orbach processes @xcite .    to vary the strength of the external magnetic field , the permanent magnet is scanned along the @xmath10 axis of the probe spin .",
    "the field direction is finely aligned along the nv centre s symmetry axis by exploiting the dependence of the pl intensity on the transverse magnetic field @xcite . for each magnet position ,",
    "an optically detected magnetic resonance ( odmr ) spectrum of the nv spin is first recorded in order to determine the nv transition frequency @xmath45 , from which the magnetic field amplitude @xmath11 is deduced .",
    "next , the spin population decay after a fixed time @xmath39 is measured by repeating the laser pulse sequence @xmath46 times , after which the magnet is moved to the next position .",
    "further details regarding the acquisition procedure are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : methods : procedure ] .          in the first instance we measure the epr spectrum of the p1 centres in the vicinity of a single nv centre probe , thus extending previous measurements to the single probe domain .",
    "to this end , the magnetic field is scanned in the range @xmath47 g , corresponding to transition frequencies @xmath48 mhz .",
    "a probe evolution time of @xmath49s was used to monitor the nv spin relaxation rate and detect cross - relaxation events as @xmath11 is varied .",
    "this evolution time was chosen to optimise the sensitivity given the strength of the observed transitions . figs .",
    "[ fig2]a and [ fig2]b show the normalised signal @xmath50 plotted against @xmath45 ( bottom axis ) and @xmath11 ( top axis ) .",
    "these measurements confirm the presence of five main transitions seen in previous p1 studies @xcite .",
    "these correspond to a change of the target ( t ) p1 electron spin projection ( @xmath51 ) while the nuclear spin projection is conserved ( @xmath52 ) , and are referred to as single - quantum transitions ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]c ) .",
    "the presence of five transitions is caused by two effects .",
    "first , the hyperfine interaction induces a three - fold splitting associated with the three possible nuclear spin projections @xmath53 .",
    "second , there exists two families of p1 centres depending on whether the symmetry axis of the unpaired electron s orbital is parallel to the @xmath54 $ ] crystallographic axis ( ` on - axis ' ) , which is also by convention the direction of the nv symmetry axis and of the applied magnetic field , or along one of the other three axes @xmath55 $ ] , @xmath56 $ ] and @xmath57 $ ] ( ` off - axis ' ) .",
    "consequently , the measured hyperfine splitting of the @xmath58 states have two different values for these two families of p1 centres , giving a total of five different transition frequencies .",
    "note that each p1 centre switches between all four symmetry axes on a time scale of a few ms @xcite , which is much shorter than our total measurement time . therefore , even a single p1 centre will produce five resonance lines in the @xmath0-epr spectrum , with the on - axis lines being three times weaker than the off - axis lines , since all four possible axes have an equal rate of occurrence .",
    "in addition to the five main spectral features , four weaker peaks are observed in the @xmath0-epr spectrum ( see zoom - in graphs in fig . [",
    "these correspond to double - quantum transitions involving a flip of both the p1 electron spin ( @xmath59 ) and nuclear spin ( @xmath60 ) @xcite .",
    "the two allowed transitions are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2]c and are also split by the two families of p1 symmetry axis .",
    "the transition frequencies are predicted by calculating the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian of the p1 centre , @xmath61 , and solving the resonance condition ( [ eq : rescond ] ) .",
    "the spin hamiltonian for an on - axis p1 centre is @xmath62 where @xmath63 ghz / t and @xmath64 mhz / t are the gyromagnetic ratios of the electron and of the @xmath1n nucleus , respectively , @xmath65 mhz and @xmath66 mhz are the axial and transverse hyperfine coupling parameters , and @xmath67 mhz is the nuclear quadrupole coupling parameter @xcite",
    ". finally , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the electron and nuclear spin operators of the target p1 .",
    "the analytic expressions for the transition frequencies at resonance , @xmath70 , are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : methods : p1 ] , and the resulting values are indicated in table [ table : epr ] and shown as vertical lines in figs .",
    "[ fig2]a and [ fig2]b .",
    "they are found to be in excellent agreement with the experimental values .",
    ".summary of the theoretical and experimental epr transition frequencies of p1 centres in diamond on resonance with a probe nv spin .",
    "the first column indicates the @xmath1n nuclear spin projection , @xmath71 , for the single - quantum transitions , and the initial and final projections for the double - quantum transitions .",
    "the second column indicates the symmetry axis of the p1 centre , along the @xmath54 $ ] axis ( on - axis ) or along one of the other three crystallographic axes ( off - axis ) .",
    "the theoretical values are obtained as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : methods : p1 ] , with uncertainties estimated based on the uncertainty on the value of @xmath16 , which is the dominant source of error here .",
    "the experimental values are extracted from fitting the spectra in figs .",
    "[ fig2]a and [ fig2]b with a sum of lorentzian functions , with the uncertainty indicated being the standard error given by the fit . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the direct nmr transition corresponds to the situation where the nv electron spin interacts directly with a target nuclear spin , as was investigated in sec .",
    "[ sec : nmr ] , regardless of any hyperfine interaction with a nearby electron spin .",
    "for the p1 centre , this direct interaction is negligible in comparison with the hyperfine - enhanced interaction mediated by the p1 electron spin .",
    "precisely , the ratio of the induced decay rates is @xmath72 at the magnetic fields where these transitions occur ( @xmath73 g ) , this fraction is @xmath74 .",
    "this electron - mediated enhancement is significant and potentially paves the way for vastly improved sensing of nuclear spins through reporter electron spins .",
    "now we present an analysis of a pair of the hyperfine - enhanced nmr transitions in order to explain the different decay strengths seen and why only half of the transitions are detected in sec .",
    "[ sec : exp ] .",
    "the p1 hyperfine interaction leads to transitions within the p1 centre between the states @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the hyperfine - enhanced nmr transitions are achieved via a double - transition within the nv - p1 system involving one dipole - dipole interaction between nv and p1 electron and one hyperfine interaction between p1 electron and p1 nuclear spin leaving the p1 electron unchanged while both the nv and p1 nuclear spin are flipped .",
    "consider the following nmr transitions within the nv - p1 system : @xmath77 if we write out the full double transition via an intermediate state along with each type of transition we have @xmath78 the first of these transitions has a dipole - dipole transition of the form @xmath79 which has a spatial dependence of @xmath80 while the second has a dipole - dipole transition of the form @xmath81 which has a spatial dependence of @xmath82 .",
    "the total decay rate is the linear sum of all the contributing decays of atoms in the bath .",
    "hence integrating these functions across all space gives the comparative strength of the transitions .",
    "doing this in spherical coordinates gives @xmath83 as a result , those transitions depending on @xmath84 are expected to be on average a factor of @xmath85 times stronger than those transition that depend on @xmath86 .",
    "the transitions depending on @xmath86 were not resolved in our nmr measurements in sec .",
    "[ sec : exp ] because of this expected weaker transition strength .",
    "this analysis assumes an ensemble average of bath spin positions and for our single nv case it will depend on the exact position of bath spins .      in this section",
    "we briefly outline the method for numerically simulating the nuclear spin spectrum in sec .",
    "[ sec : nmr ] .",
    "the hamiltonian of the nv centre is the same as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nvham2 ] ) and the nuclear spin hamiltonian is the same as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : targham ] ) with the correct nuclear gyromagnetic ratio replacing @xmath87 .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian is the dipole - dipole hamiltonian ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : ddham ] ) ) .",
    "the simulation is done via evolution under the lindblad equation from eq .",
    "( [ eq : lindblad ] ) .",
    "the superoperator formalism is used to allow timesteps longer than the dephasing time of both the nv and the target nuclear spin .",
    "in addition a background @xmath0 process was applied to the nv via taking timesteps of @xmath88 and decaying the diagonal elements of the density matrix with each timestep .",
    "the initial state of the nv was taken to be @xmath89 due to the nuclear spin polarisation near the gslac .",
    "the decay rate , @xmath90 , was found by fitting the population in @xmath91 after evolution time t , to the function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : plfunction ] ) .      in this section",
    "we estimate the sensitivity of the method by comparing the signal caused by a target spin to the measurement noise .",
    "the measurement sequence consists of a 3-@xmath37s laser pulse followed by a wait time @xmath39 assumed to be much longer than 3 @xmath37s .",
