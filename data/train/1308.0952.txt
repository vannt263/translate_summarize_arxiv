    "distinguishing entanglement from separability is one of the most important question in the theory of quantum entanglement , and the positive partial transpose ( ppt ) criterion @xcite gives a simple but strong necessary condition for separability .",
    "the ppt condition is actually equivalent to the separability if the rank of a given ppt state is sufficiently low by @xcite . in the case",
    "that the rank is not so high , it turns out that the local geometry is quite useful to distinguish and construct entanglement among ppt states .",
    "basic idea is to consider the smallest faces determined by a given separable state in the convex sets of all separable states and all ppt states respectively , and compare those .",
    "see @xcite for recent progresses in this direction .    in this paper",
    ", we turn our attention to the global geometries for separable and ppt states , and look for the differences .",
    "we denote by @xmath3 the convex set of all @xmath4 separable states , and by @xmath5 the convex set of all @xmath2 ppt states . for the convex set @xmath3 , it is easy to see that a convex combination of two extreme points is always on the boundary of the convex set . actually , the line segment between two extreme points of @xmath6 is already a nontrivial face of the convex set , in most cases .",
    "see @xcite for more details for the convex geometry of @xmath6 .",
    "more generally , the convex hull of @xmath7 extreme points of @xmath3 is a face of the convex set , in most cases by @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is natural to ask how these properties are retained for the convex set @xmath5 .    for a convex compact set @xmath8 in a finite dimensional real vector space",
    ", we introduce the number @xmath9 the smallest natural number @xmath10 such that the convex combination of @xmath10 extreme points of @xmath8 may be an interior point of @xmath8 .",
    "we recall that the interior of a convex set is defined by the interior with respect to the relative topology induced by the affine manifold generated by itself . sometimes , it is more convenient to consider the convex cone @xmath11 generated by the convex compact set @xmath8 .",
    "for example , @xmath12 ( @xmath13 , respectively ) is the convex cone of all @xmath4 unnormalized separable ( ppt , respectively ) states . in this case",
    ", we may replace extreme points by extreme rays to get the same number @xmath9 .",
    "recall that a point @xmath14 of a convex compact set @xmath8 is an extreme point of @xmath8 if and only if @xmath14 generates an extreme ray of the convex cone @xmath11 , whenever the hyperplane generated by @xmath8 does not contain the origin .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath15 for every @xmath16 .",
    "the main purpose of this note is to show that @xmath17 to see the geometric difference between @xmath18 and @xmath19 . in other words",
    ", we can take just two extreme points of @xmath19 whose convex combinations belong to the interior of @xmath19 .    to do this",
    ", we consider the following @xmath20 states @xmath21 for a given positive number @xmath22 and a real number @xmath23 , where @xmath24 denotes zero and @xmath25 is the smallest positive number @xmath26 so that the following @xmath27 matrix @xmath28 is positive , as it was discussed in section 2 of @xcite .",
    "we note that @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , it is immediate to see that @xmath30 is a ppt state .",
    "these ppt states have been constructed in @xcite for @xmath31 .",
    "the main point is to extend this construction for the full range of @xmath23 .",
    "we check that they are extreme points of @xmath19 in most cases , with a few exceptions .",
    "note that the case of @xmath32 and @xmath33 has been checked to be extreme in @xcite .",
    "if we divide the parameter @xmath34 into three arcs and take any two extreme points from different arcs then their convex combinations lie in the interior of @xmath19 .",
    "we see that some of them turn out to be even in the interior of @xmath18 .",
    "it had been asked in @xcite whether the sum of two ppt entangled extreme states can be separable , and the authors @xcite gave an affirmative answer .",
    "more precisely , it was shown that sum of two extreme ppt entangled states with rank four may be separable .",
    "our construction in this paper shows that sum of two extreme ppt entangled states with rank five may be even diagonal matrices with positive diagonal entries .",
    "let @xmath35 be the @xmath36-algebra consisting of all @xmath37 matrices over the complex field .",
    "we also consider the same question for the convex cone @xmath38 ( respectively @xmath39 ) of all positive maps ( respectively decomposable positive maps ) from @xmath40 into @xmath35 , to show that @xmath41 . in the case of @xmath42",
    ", we have @xmath43 and @xmath44 . by the jamiokowski - choi isomorphism @xcite",
    ", the cones @xmath38 and @xmath39 are considered as subsets of @xmath45 , and we have the relation @xmath46 we also recall @xcite that @xmath47 and @xmath38 ( respectively @xmath13 and @xmath39 ) are dual to each others with respect to the bilinear pairing @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the choi matrix of @xmath50 defined by @xmath51 , and interior points of these convex sets can be characterized by the above duality :    * @xmath52 is an interior point of @xmath3 if and only if @xmath53 for all nonzero @xmath54 .",
    "* @xmath50 is an interior point of @xmath38 if and only if @xmath55 for all @xmath56 .    in this characterization of interior points of convex sets ,",
    "we note that it suffices to check the positivity of the pairing only for extreme points ( rays ) of the dual convex set ( convex cone ) .",
    "see proposition 5.1 and 5.4 of @xcite .    in the next section ,",
    "we examine the properties of the states @xmath30 and how to choose two of them to get an interior point by their convex combination . in section 3",
    ", we show that they are extreme points in @xmath19 , in most cases .",
    "we consider the convex cones @xmath57 and @xmath39 in section 4 , and close this note with discussions in section 5 .",
    "the facial structures for the convex set @xmath5 are well understood @xcite .",
    "every face of @xmath5 is of the form @xmath58 for subspaces @xmath59 and @xmath60 of @xmath61 , and its interior is given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 denotes the range space of @xmath64 , and @xmath65 is the partial transpose of @xmath64 .",
    "especially , a ppt state @xmath64 is an interior point of @xmath5 if and only if the ranges of @xmath64 and @xmath65 are full spaces .",
    "extreme points of the convex set @xmath3 are nothing but product states by the definition of separability .",
    "if we take @xmath10 product states with @xmath66 and form a separable state @xmath67 with their convex combination then the range space of @xmath64 is never the full space , and so @xmath64 is on the boundary of @xmath5 . by the relation @xmath68",
    ", we conclude that @xmath64 is also on the boundary of @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath69 . since the identity matrix is in the interior of @xmath3 ,",
    "we conclude that @xmath70 .",
    "in fact , it is easy to see that every diagonal matrix with nonzero positive diagonal entries is an interior point of the convex set @xmath3 , by the duality between separable states and positive maps .",
    "now , we proceed to examine the properties of the states @xmath30 .",
    "we also consider the ppt states defined by @xmath71 if @xmath72",
    "then @xmath73 is nothing but ppt entangled edge states of type @xmath74 constructed in @xcite .",
    "we recall that a ppt state @xmath64 is said to be of type @xmath75 if the ranks of @xmath64 and @xmath65 are @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "we note that the state @xmath30 defined in introduction is given by @xmath78 which is block - wise symmetric . if @xmath79 then @xmath80 was shown to be separable for each @xmath22 in @xcite . on the other hand , if @xmath81 then @xmath82 was shown @xcite to be separable if and only if @xmath83 . when @xmath84 , we note that @xmath82 is nothing but ppt entangled state given by strmer @xcite in the early eighties .",
    "we also know that both @xmath73 and @xmath30 are ppt entangled edge states for @xmath72 by @xcite .",
    "now , we turn our attention to the state @xmath85 .",
    "we note that @xmath86 is the separable state given by the following four product vectors @xmath87    & ( 1,1,1)^ ( 1,1,1)^ , & & ( 1,1,-1)^ ( 1,1,-1)^ , + & ( 1,-1,1)^ ( 1,-1,1)^ , & & ( -1,1,1)^ ( -1,1,1)^ , +    @xmath87 as it was shown in @xcite . the states @xmath85 with @xmath84 appear in the construction @xcite of ppt entangled states of type @xmath88 using the duality between positive linear maps and separable states .",
    "the special case @xmath89 is just the first example of @xmath0 ppt entangled state given by choi @xcite . in short , we see that @xmath85 is separable if and only if @xmath83 .",
    "if we take the diagonal unitary @xmath90 , then we have @xmath91 and so it follows that @xmath92 therefore , the separability and ppt properties of @xmath30 and @xmath73 are invariant under the translation of @xmath23 by @xmath93 , as well as the types of the states .",
    "therefore , we have the following :    for states @xmath94 and @xmath95 , we have the following :    1 .   if @xmath96 for any integer @xmath97 , then @xmath73 and @xmath30 are ppt entangled edge states of type @xmath74 and @xmath98 , respectively .",
    "2 .   if @xmath99 for an even integer @xmath97 , then @xmath73 and @xmath30 are separable states of type @xmath74 and @xmath98 , respectively .",
    "3 .   if @xmath99 for an odd integer @xmath97 and @xmath83 , then @xmath73 and @xmath30 are separable states of type @xmath100 and @xmath88 , respectively .",
    "4 .   if @xmath99 for an odd integer @xmath97 and @xmath84 , then @xmath73 and @xmath30 are ppt entangled states of type @xmath100 and @xmath88 , respectively .",
    "the separability and entangledness of the states @xmath30 and @xmath73 are summarized in figure 1 .",
    "2truecm     we note that the circle @xmath101 is divided by three arcs by the range of the variable @xmath23 : @xmath102 we also note that the following three vectors @xmath103 belong to the kernel of @xmath30 , regardless of the values of @xmath104 and @xmath23 .",
    "there are extra kernel vectors : @xmath105    if we take @xmath106 and @xmath107 so that @xmath34 and @xmath108 belong to the different arcs , then it is clear that the kernels of @xmath30 and @xmath109 have the trivial intersection .",
    "this means that the nontrivial convex combination @xmath52 of these two states has the full range space , as well as the partial conjugate .",
    "therefore , we conclude that this ppt state @xmath52 belongs to the interior of the convex set @xmath19 . in the next section , we will show that each state @xmath30 is an extreme point in the convex set @xmath19 consisting of all @xmath0 ppt states , whenever @xmath96 for an integer @xmath97 . from this , we conclude that @xmath110 .",
    "if we take @xmath106 and @xmath107 so that @xmath34 and @xmath108 belong to the same arc , then we note that the convex combinations of @xmath30 and @xmath109 are on the boundary .    for a given @xmath34",
    ", we take the antipodal point @xmath111 then we see that @xmath112 is a diagonal matrix , and so it is separable .",
    "actually , it is an interior point of @xmath18 , since there is no zero entry in the diagonal .",
    "this shows that the convex combination of two extreme ppt states may be in the interior of the convex set @xmath18 of all separable states .",
    "we note that @xmath113 for each @xmath23 , and so we may take @xmath22 so that @xmath114",
    ". then we see that the sum @xmath115 of two extreme ppt states is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix .",
    "first , we briefly explain the method @xcite to check if a given face @xmath116 is an extreme point or not , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are subspaces of @xmath117 .",
    "let @xmath118 be the real hilbert space of all @xmath119 hermitian matrices in @xmath120 with the inner product @xmath121 , and orthogonal projections @xmath122 and @xmath123 in @xmath118 onto @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "we define real linear maps @xmath124 and @xmath125 between @xmath118 by @xmath126 then we see that @xmath127 , where @xmath128 denotes the kernel space of @xmath124 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath129 is one - dimensional then @xmath116 must be an extreme point .",
    "it is not so difficult to see that the converse does hold .",
    "thus , we can conclude that @xmath116 is an extreme point if and only if the condition @xmath130 holds .",
    "now , we proceed to show that @xmath30 is an extreme point in the convex set @xmath19 , whenever @xmath131 .",
    "let @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "we note that @xmath134 , so we see that @xmath135 . applying the gram - schmidt process to linearly independent vectors of @xmath136 , we can compute the orthogonal projection @xmath122 as follows : @xmath137 by a direct computation",
    ", we can show that both @xmath128 and @xmath138 are twenty - five dimensional real linear subspaces .",
    "let @xmath139 be the usual matrix units in @xmath140 .",
    "then , we can find a basis @xmath141 of real linear space @xmath128 , which consists of hermitian matrices including the following vectors : @xmath142 we also see that @xmath143 with hermitian matrices @xmath144 s . here , we just write down the list of @xmath144 for @xmath145 , as follows : @xmath146 for the full list of vectors @xmath147 and @xmath144 for @xmath148 , see the appendix . by solving the linear equation @xmath149 with respect",
    "to @xmath150 s and @xmath151 s , we see that the subspace @xmath152 is generated @xmath30 .",
    "in fact , we have @xmath153 therefore , we see that @xmath30 is an extreme point in @xmath19 for @xmath154 .    we note that @xmath155 is extreme if and only if @xmath30 is so by the relation .",
    "consequently , we may conclude that @xmath30 is extreme whenever @xmath96 for an integer @xmath97 .",
    "in order to see that @xmath44 , we recall the positive linear map @xmath156 considered in @xcite , which maps a @xmath157 matrix @xmath158 to the following @xmath157 matrix @xmath159 where @xmath160 with @xmath161 . it was shown that @xmath156 generates an exposed ray of the convex cone @xmath57 , and so generates an extreme ray of @xmath57 , whenever the condition @xmath162 holds . it is now clear that if we take the convex combination of two antipodal maps @xmath163 and @xmath164 then we get a positive map whose choi matrix is a diagonal matrix with positive diagonal entries , and so we see that this map is an interior point of @xmath57 by duality .",
    "it remains to consider the convex cone @xmath39 consisting of all decomposable maps from @xmath40 into @xmath35 .",
    "we first note that every decomposable map is the convex combination of the maps @xmath165 for @xmath166 matrices @xmath167 and @xmath168 , where @xmath169 denotes the transpose of @xmath170 .",
    "therefore , every decomposable map from @xmath40 into @xmath35 is of the form @xmath171 for a finite sets @xmath172 and @xmath173 of @xmath166 matrices .",
    "we also note that if the map ( [ decom ] ) is on the boundary of the cone @xmath38 then it is also on the boundary of the cone @xmath39 . for a product vector @xmath174 ,",
    "the pairing in is given by @xmath175 therefore , the map ( [ decom ] ) is on the boundary of @xmath38 if and only if the equation @xmath176 has a common solution @xmath177 .",
    "if we put @xmath178 and @xmath179 then it was shown in @xcite that    1 .   if @xmath180 , then there exists a solution 2 .   if @xmath181 and @xmath182 then there exists a solution .",
    "3 .   if @xmath183 , then the existence of solutions is not guaranteed .",
    "therefore , we have the following :    [ ukyilhg ] for given natural numbers @xmath16 , consider the equation @xmath184 with unknowns @xmath10 and @xmath185 .",
    "then , we have the following :    1 .",
    "we have @xmath41 in general .",
    "2 .   if the equation ( [ krawtchouk ] ) has no solution then @xmath186 .",
    "the polynomial in the diophantine equation ( [ krawtchouk ] ) is called the krawtchouk polynomial which plays an important role in coding theory .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the equation ( [ krawtchouk ] ) has not yet completely solved .    in order to get an upper bound for @xmath187 , we have to construct decomposable maps in the interior of the cone @xmath39 . by the duality between decomposable maps and ppt states with respect to the pairing , we see that the map in ( [ decom ] ) lies on the boundary of the cone @xmath39 if and only if there exists a ppt states @xmath188 such that the ranges of @xmath188 and the partial transpose @xmath189 coincide with @xmath190 and @xmath191 , respectively .",
    "we consider the case with @xmath192 , to take an @xmath193 dimensional subspace @xmath59 of @xmath194 with no product vectors @xcite .",
    "then it is clear that there is no ppt state @xmath188 such that @xmath195 and @xmath196 . indeed ,",
    "if we assume that there is such a state @xmath188 then @xmath188 must be separable by @xcite , but this state violates the range criterion @xcite .",
    "therefore , if we take a basis @xmath197 in @xmath198 then the map @xmath199 is an interior point of the cone @xmath200 .",
    "this shows that @xmath201 . in the case of @xmath192 , it was shown in @xcite that the equation ( [ krawtchouk ] ) has a solution if and only if @xmath97 is an even number .",
    "this proves the odd case of the following : @xmath202 when @xmath203 is an even integer then the equation ( [ krawtchouk ] ) has the unique solution @xmath204 , and one can construct @xmath205 and @xmath206 so that the decomposable map ( [ decom ] ) is an interior point of @xmath200 , following the argument in @xcite . to do this , we consider the @xmath207 matrix @xmath208 whose @xmath209-th @xmath210 block is the identity matrix and other entries are all zero .",
    "we also consider the @xmath207 matrix @xmath211 whose @xmath209-th block is @xmath212 and other entries are all zero .",
    "then we see that @xmath213 is just the trace map sending @xmath214 to @xmath215 , which is an interior point of @xmath216 .",
    "this shows the above equality ( [ 2xxn ] ) when @xmath97 is even .",
    "for the @xmath217 system , the whole facial structures of the cone @xmath218 have been characterized in @xcite .    in the case of @xmath219 , we know that the equation ( [ krawtchouk ] ) has a solution if and only if @xmath97 is of the form @xmath220 , with the solution @xmath221 .",
    "especially , in the @xmath0 case , we have the solution @xmath222 . in this case",
    ", we see that the map @xmath223 is exactly the trace map , which is an interior point of @xmath224 . therefore , we have @xmath225",
    "for a given convex set , we have considered the smallest number of extreme points with which we may get an interior point by their convex combinations . for @xmath20 ppt states and positive maps , these numbers turned out to be just @xmath226 .",
    "this means that there exist antipodal  extreme points .",
    "poor knowledge on extreme ppt states and extreme positive maps prevent the authors to extend these results to higher dimensions .    for the cases of separable states and decomposable maps ,",
    "these numbers exceed @xmath226 .",
    "this means that there exist no antipodal  extreme points , and might reflect the facts that the notions of separability and decomposability are defined by convex hulls of prescribed given extreme points , and that there are no easy intrinsic characterizations for these notions .",
    "the equality @xmath227 tells us that the number @xmath1 is the minimum of the lengths of interior points of @xmath228 .",
    "recall that the length of a separable state @xmath64 is given by the minimum number of product states with which @xmath64 can be expressed as a convex combination .",
    "it seems to be an interesting question to ask if every interior point of @xmath228 has the length @xmath1 .",
    "the authors @xcite have recently constructed separable states in @xmath3 whose lengths exceed the number @xmath1 , for the cases @xmath229 and @xmath230 .",
    "all of those are boundary points of the convex set @xmath3 .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "for some faces of @xmath3 , it is possible to characterize the interior by lengths .",
    "for example , this is clearly the case if a face of @xmath3 is affinely isomorphic to a simplex .",
    "see @xcite for constructions of such faces in the @xmath20 or @xmath231 cases .",
