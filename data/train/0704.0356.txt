    "neutron stars following a core collapse supernova are rotating at birth and can be subject to various nonaxisymmetric instabilities ( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) . among those , if the rotation rate is high enough so that the ratio of rotational kinetic energy @xmath3 to gravitational potential energy @xmath4 , @xmath5 , exceeds the critical value @xmath6 , inferred from studies with incompressible maclaurin spheroids , the star is subject to a _ dynamical _ bar - mode ( @xmath7 @xmath8-mode ) instability driven by hydrodynamics and gravity .",
    "its study is highly motivated nowadays as such an instability bears important implications in the prospects of detection of gravitational radiation from newly - born rapidly rotating neutron stars .",
    "simulations of the dynamical bar - mode instability are available in the literature , both using simplified models based on equilibrium stellar configurations perturbed with suitable eigenfunctions  @xcite , and more involved models for the core collapse scenario  @xcite , and in either case both in newtonian gravity and general relativity . due to its superior simplicity the former approach has received much more attention , notwithstanding that the conclusions drawn from perturbed stellar models may not be straightforwardly extended to the collapse scenario .",
    "newtonian simulations of triaxial instabilities following core collapse were first performed by  @xcite .",
    "these showed that the bar - mode instability sets in when @xmath9 and when the progenitor rotates rapidly and highly differentially .",
    "such conditions are met when the ( artificial ) depletion of internal energy to trigger the collapse is large enough to produce a very compact core for which a significant spun - up can be achieved .",
    "more recently , three - dimensional simulations of the core collapse of rotating polytropes in general relativity have been performed by  @xcite .",
    "these authors studied the evolution of the bar - mode instability starting with axisymmetric core collapse initial models which reached values of @xmath10 during the infall phase .",
    "these simulations showed that the maximum value of @xmath11 achieved during collapse and bounce depends strongly on the velocity profile , the total mass of the initial core , and on the equation of state . in agreement with the findings from the newtonian simulations of  @xcite , the bar - mode instability sets in if the progenitor rotates rapidly ( @xmath12 ) and has a high degree of differential rotation .",
    "in addition , the artificial depletion of pressure and internal energy to trigger the collapse , leading to a compact core which subsequently spins up , also plays a key role in general relativity for a noticeable growth of the bar - mode instability .",
    "whether the requirements inferred from numerical simulations are at all met by the collapse progenitors remains unclear .",
    "as shown by  @xcite magnetic torques can spin down the core of the progenitor , which leads to slowly rotating neutron stars at birth ( @xmath13ms ) .",
    "the most recent , state - of - the - art computations of the evolution of massive stars , which include angular momentum redistribution by magnetic torques and spin estimates of neutron stars at birth  @xcite , lead to core collapse progenitors which do not seem to rotate fast enough to guarantee the unambiguous growth of the canonical bar - mode instability .",
    "rapidly - rotating cores might be produced by an appropriate mixture of high progenitor mass ( @xmath14 ) and low metallicity ( n.  stergioulas , private communication ) . in such case",
    "the progenitor could by - pass the red supergiant phase in which the differential rotation of the core produces a magnetic field by dynamo action which couples the core to the outer layers of the star , transporting angular momentum outwards and spinning down the core . according to  @xcite",
    "about 1% of all stars with @xmath15 will produce rapidly - rotating cores .",
    "on the other hand , newtonian simulations of the bar - mode instability from perturbed equilibrium models of rotating stars have shown that @xmath6 independent of the stiffness of the equation of state provided the star is not strongly differentially rotating .",
    "the relativistic simulations of  @xcite yielded a value of @xmath16 for the onset of the instability , while the dynamics of the process closely resembles that found in newtonian theory , i.e.  unstable models with large enough @xmath11 develop spiral arms following the formation of bars , ejecting mass and redistributing the angular momentum . as the degree of differential rotation becomes higher newtonian simulations",
    "have also shown that @xmath17 can be as low as @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "more recently  @xcite have reported that rotating stars with an _ extreme _ degree of differential rotation are dynamically unstable against bar - mode deformation even for values of @xmath11 of @xmath0@xmath1 .",
    "given its recent discovery and its potential astrophysical implications for post - bounce core collapse dynamics and gravitational wave astronomy , we present in this paper high resolution simulations of such low @xmath2 bar - mode instabilities .",
    "this work is further motivated in the light of the few numerical simulations available in the literature .",
    "our main goal is to revisit the simulations by  @xcite on the low @xmath2 bar - mode instability , and particularly to check how sensitive the onset and development of the instability is to numerical issues such as grid resolution . to this aim",
    "we perform newtonian hydrodynamical simulations of a subset of models analyzed by  @xcite using an adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) code  @xcite which allows us to perform such three dimensional simulations with the highest resolution ever used .",
    "our simulations reveal the complex morphological features involved in the nonlinear dynamics of the instability , where the excitation of kelvin - helmholtz - like fluid modes influences the saturation of the bar - mode deformation .",
    "we advance that while the overall trends found by  @xcite are confirmed by our work , the resolution employed in the simulations does play a key role for the long - term behaviour of the instability and for the nonlinear dynamics of rotating stars , which has implications on the attainable amplitudes of the associated gravitational wave signals .",
    "we note that we plan to upgrade the existing amr code to account for the effects of magnetic fields in order to attempt the current study in a more realistic setup .",

    "solid lines correspond to high resolution simulations and dashed lines to low resolution .",
    "for all three models the pattern frequencies @xmath94 are such that there exists a corotation radius inside the star , i.e.  a radius at which the bar - mode rotates with the same angular velocity as the fluid .",
    "the location of the corotation radius for all models of our sample is reported in table  [ tab : initial_models ] . as recently discussed by  @xcite",
    "the existence of such corotation radius is a potential requirement for the ocurrence of the instability . as becomes clear from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , all models are unstable but grid resolution has an important effect on the saturation of the instability once the nonlinear phase has been reached , as well as in the long - term dynamics of the stars .    in the linear phase of models d1h and d2h , the growth rates and frequencies agree with the results of  @xcite in both , the numerical simulations and the linear analysis ( see table  [ tab : initial_models ] ) . in the linear phase of model d3h , our frequencies are similar to the numerical results of  @xcite , although our growth rates are about a factor two larger .",
    "we emphasize that no results are reported in the linear analysis for this model in the work of  @xcite , and therefore this discrepancy can be an effect of the resolution used or of the characteristics of each numerical code .",
    "increasing resolution leads to similar results in the frequencies but to higher growth rates .    in the nonlinear phase , models d1 and d3 behave similarly for the two resolutions used ( see fig",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , and also similarly to the results by  @xcite ( compare with fig .  3 of that paper ) . for model d2",
    "we observe a radical change of behavior in the nonlinear phase of the mode evolution depending on the grid resolution .",
    "this has implications on the long - term dynamics of the star and , in particular , on the attainable amplitudes of the gravitational radiation emitted , as we discuss below .",
    "it is worth mentioning the possibility that the unstable mode at the start of model d2h might excite some other mode in the corotation band , which could not otherwise be excited for lower grid resolution . as discussed by  @xcite in their study of differentially rotating shells , there are many zero - step modes in the band , so that the whole continuous spectrum could potentially be excited . in such case",
    "these modes would have very slow power - law growth .    for all our models",
    "we have checked mass conservation along the evolution .",
    "the worst results are obtained for model d3h , for which mass is conserved within @xmath99 error when the instability saturates . at the end of the simulation ( after 48 orbital periods and 25000 iterations in the coarsest grid )",
    "the error has grown to only @xmath100 . for all other models mass conservation",
    "is even more accurate .",
    "note that these errors are within the round - off error of the code , and it is not related to the conservation properties of the numerical scheme itself . for a regular grid with @xmath52 cells and a simulation employing @xmath101 iterations , the accumulated round - off error ( binomial distribution ) using single - precision arithmetics , is about @xmath102 .",
    "correspondingly , for a @xmath57 grid ( with twice the number of iterations for the simulation ) the error is about @xmath103 . taking into account that this error affects the nonlinear evolution of the system , it is not surprising to have an error at the level of a few percent by the end of our high resolution simulations , for all conserved quantities .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the evolution of @xmath88 for model d3 and for @xmath81 ranging from 1 to 8 for our two resolutions . according to this figure , the only two modes relevant for the dynamics of the star are @xmath85 and @xmath104 .",
    "all other modes have smaller amplitudes and play no role in the dynamics .",
    "note that for odd @xmath81 modes , the value of the integrated quantity @xmath88 , if close to zero , is extremely sensitive to very small numerical asymmetries , which are induced by the patch creation scheme of our amr code .",
    "this explains the resolution differences in the initial values for odd @xmath81 modes in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( at @xmath105 they start off at @xmath106 level for the low resolution simulation ) , although they saturate at the same value irrespective of the resolution .",
    "an important diagnosis for the accuracy of the results is the location of the center of mass during an evolution .",
    "the round - off error of the numerical code imposes controlled errors in mass and linear momentum , which results in tiny displacements of the center of mass .",
    "however small ( one numerical cell in our runs ) this unphysical displacement may hinder the correct analysis of the mode growth rates .",
    "for this reason all integrated quantities shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] are computed after correcting for the displacement of the center of mass , @xmath107 , in a post - processing stage of the data analysis .",
    "were this not done , a one - armed @xmath96 mode would grow much faster than it should to bring up fictitious features in the plots .",
    "this is shown for model d2h in fig .",
    "the thick solid line in this figure corresponds to the evolution of the @xmath96 mode taking into account the correction for the center of mass displacement , while the thin solid line is the corresponding evolution of this mode without the correction .",
    "the growth and saturation of the instability is also imprinted on the gravitational waves emitted .",
    "the gravitational waveforms @xmath108 and @xmath109 for models",
    "d1 , d2 , and d3 , computed using the standard quadrupole formula , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . for a source of mass @xmath110 located at a distance @xmath111",

    "the resulting chirp - like signal in all the models , particularly apparent for model d2l , indicates the presence of a bipolar distribution of mass within the star ( see sec .",
    "[ morpho ] ) .",
    "as mentioned before , the effects of grid resolution on the evolution of the nonlinear phase of the bar - mode are imprinted on the gravitational waveforms .",

    "[ fig6 ] are the waveforms which correspond to the low - resolution models , and thin solid lines to the high - resolution counterparts . the evolution of @xmath91 for model d3 , displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , shows little deviations with grid resolution , and this translates into very similar gravitational wave patterns ( bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) , the differences becoming more noticeable in the nonlinear phase following saturation ( @xmath116 ) . for model",
    "d1 ( top panel ) , the differences also become more apparent at later times during the evolution , in good agreement with the dissimilar behaviour of the matter dynamics in this model , as encoded in the evolution of @xmath91 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . as happens for model d3 the first few cycles of the gravitational waveform , when the mode is still in the linear phase , are accurately captured for both resolutions .",
    "the major dependence of the waveform on the grid resolution is found for model d2 .",
    "again , the linear phase for the growth of the bar deformation is accurately captured irrespective of the resolution ( and agrees with the perturbative results of @xcite ) .",
    "this is signalled in the perfect overlapping of both gravitational waveforms during the first three cycles ( see the middle panel of fig .  [ fig6 ] ) . however , the different nonlinear dynamics of the bar - mode deformation for this model , shown in the middle panel of fig .  [ fig3 ] , is severely imprinted on the gravitational waveform .",
    "model d2h emits gravitational waves which have roughly one order of magnitude smaller amplitude than those computed for the corresponding low resolution model .",
    "we next describe the morphological features encountered during the evolution of some representative models .",
    "[ fig7 ] shows three snaphsots of the evolution of model d3h for the density ( top ) , the azimuthal component of the vorticity , @xmath117 ( middle ) , and the specific angular momentum , @xmath118 ( bottom ) . from left to right the snapshots correspond to the initial time ( @xmath119 ) , a time when the bar - mode instability is growing ( @xmath120 ) , and the time when the instability saturates ( @xmath121 ) .",

    "[ fig7 ] .",
    "the evolution of model d3h shows that as the @xmath85 mode grows the star develops an ellipsoidal shape which remains spinning beyond saturation .",
    "since the low @xmath11 @xmath85 mode saturates at lower values ( @xmath123 ) than the classical bar - mode instability ( @xmath124 ) , no clear bars are visible in the density plot . at late times",

    "no other global features can be seen , consistent with the fact that @xmath126 for all modes other than @xmath85 and 4 .",
    "the vorticity plot shows that the @xmath85 mode at @xmath120 adopts the form of a two - armed spiral winding up around the central parts of the star . as the mode begins to saturate ( @xmath127 ) the spirals break apart into the outer layers in a turbulent flow reminiscent of the ( shear ) kelvin - helmholtz instability , and shock as they reach the atmosphere .",
    "these trends are also visible in the specific angular momentum plot .    the presence of a corotation radius , at @xmath128 for model d3h , seems to play a role in the growth and saturation of the instability , in agreement with the recent findings of  @xcite .",
    "as the bar - mode grows , pressure waves carry angular momentum outside the corotation radius , which is deposited in the outer layers of the star .",
    "this excites kelvin - helmholtz - like instabilities in the fluid that break the mode outside the corotation radius . when this happens the @xmath85 instability stops growing and no more angular momentum is extracted .",
    "figure  [ fig8 ] shows late - time snapshots of the equatorial plane distribution of the density perturbation , i.e.  @xmath129 , for models d2h and d3h .",
    "the times are chosen well inside the nonlinear and saturation phase of the instability .",
    "this figure helps to interpret the mode dynamics and its saturation along the lines mentioned before : during the evolution the density perturbations are shed in waves from the center towards the outer layers of the star . at late times ,",
    "when the instability saturates , such shedding stops , and the density perturbation reaches the largest values outside the corotation radius ( depicted with white solid lines in fig .",

    "the presence of pressure waves is emphasized in the schlieren plot , very accurately captured in model d2h .",

    "we have found that in the nonlinear phase of the evolution , the excitation of kelvin - helmholtz - like fluid modes outside the corotation radii of the stellar models leads to the saturation of the bar - mode deformation . while the overall trends reported in the investigation of  @xcite are confirmed by our work , the resolution used to perform the simulations may play a key role on the long - term behaviour of the instability and on the nonlinear dynamics of rotating stars , which has only become apparent for some specific models of our sample ( namely model d2 ) .",
    "this , in turn , has implications on the attainable amplitudes of the associated gravitational wave signals .",
    "the work reported in this paper is a first step in our ongoing efforts of studying the dynamical bar - mode instability within the magnetized core collapse scenario .",
