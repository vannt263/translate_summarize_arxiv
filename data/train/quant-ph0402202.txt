    "quantum information has recently entered the domain of continuous variable ( cv ) systems @xcite and quantum error correction theory in particular has been extended to the cv framework @xcite .",
    "in such a framework , the main damage induced by decoherence is typically a small diffusion in the two canonical coordinates characterizing the cv system , which may represent the position and momentum of a particle or two orthogonal field quadratures of an optical mode .",

    "@xcite is that , using qubits encoded in such a way , a universal set of fault - tolerant quantum gates can be implemented using only `` cheap '' standard devices which , in the case of a cv optical mode , correspond to beam splitters , phase shifters , squeezers , homodyne and photodetectors . in such a proposal ,",
    "all the difficulties are confined to the preparation of the encoded states which , in the ideal limit , are superpositions of an infinite number of infinitely squeezed states and require the use of particular nonlinear interactions for their generation .",
    "the preparation of these shift - resistant quantum codes represents the main drawback of the gottesman _",
    "proposal for universal fault - tolerant quantum computation in a cv system and therefore it is crucial to find an experimentally viable way to generate the quantum codewords employing optical cv modes . a first attempt has been based on a conditional scheme in which the cv system is coupled to a single qubit and which could be implemented on a single trapped ion @xcite . here ,",
    "elaborating on a suggestion in @xcite of using a nonlinear hamiltonian of ponderomotive type , we present an all - optical scheme involving two modes interacting in a crossed - kerr medium .",
    "@xcite shows that a single qubit , whose generic state can be written as @xmath0 , can be encoded in an oscillator with canonical coordinates @xmath1 ( with @xmath2=i$ ] ) so that the corresponding logical state @xmath3 is easily correctable with respect to small diffusion errors in both position and momentum .",
    "the codewords @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the simultaneous eigenstates with eigenvalue @xmath6 of the two displacement operators @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( the so called _ stabilizer generators _ of the code @xcite ) with arbitrary @xmath9 .",
    "the two codewords are a coherent superposition of infinitely squeezed states both in position and momentum , that is , @xmath10 they have a comb - like structure with spacing @xmath11 in the @xmath12-space and @xmath13 in the @xmath14-space and are displaced with respect to each other by @xmath15 along the @xmath12-axis ( this is also responsible for the alternating signs in the p - representation , see fig .",
    "[ ideal ] ) .    in a cv system ,",
    "errors and decoherence manifest themselves through random shifts of the two quadratures @xmath16 and @xmath17 . the present coding is designed for the case when these shifts are never too large , i.e. , the error is correctable only if the shift is below a certain threshold . in fact , the recovery process is realized by measuring the stabilizer generators @xmath18 , which is equivalent to measure @xmath17 ( @xmath19 ) and therefore detects momentum shifts , and @xmath20 , which is equivalent to measure @xmath16 ( @xmath21 ) and detects position shifts .",
    "then the error is corrected by displacing the state to the nearest peak , that is , to the nearest multiple of @xmath22 along the @xmath17-axis and to the nearest multiple of @xmath15 along the @xmath16-axis .",
    "therefore the recovery is successful only when the momentum shift @xmath23 satisfies @xmath24 and the position shift @xmath25 satisfies @xmath26 , because otherwise the displacement would recover the wrong codeword , corrupting therefore the encoded information .",
    "an alternative choice for the codewords is the basis formed by the two superposition states @xmath27 , which are used in @xcite for the error recovery in the @xmath14-space because they have the same displaced comb - like structure of @xmath28 and @xmath29 in the @xmath14-space rather than in the @xmath12-space ( see fig .  1 ) .",

    "even if we had only small position and momentum shifts satisfying the above conditions for a correct recovery , one would still have errors due to the use of approximate codewords possessing a nonzero overlap @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
