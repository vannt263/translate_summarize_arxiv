    "four years into the era of gamma - ray burst ( grb ) afterglow studies , there are currently 17 grbs with measured redshifts .",
    "arguably the most important utility of grb redshift measurements is the opportunity to determine the total energy release .",
    "the total energy release is , of course , a critical diagnostic of the progenitors of grbs in that it affords a direct probe of the energy ( and hence mass ) reservoir in the progenitor system .",
    "in fact , an estimate of the isotropic energy radiated from grb 971214 of @xmath2 erg ( about 10% the restmass energy of a neutron star ) placed uncomfortable constraints on most viable stellar mass progenitors @xcite .",
    "not all grbs have estimated energies as high as grb 971214 ; indeed , estimated grb energies range over nearly four orders of magnitude and appear to be anything but standard candles .",
    "this fact , in and of itself , may point to a diversity of progenitor scenarios and/or emission geometries of grbs as a class .",
    "well before the first redshift determination of grbs , considerable effort was devoted towards divining the total prompt energy release ( or peak luminosity ) in grbs by examining the brightness distribution of grb events @xcite .",
    "the so - called `` log @xmath3-log @xmath4 '' or `` log @xmath3-log @xmath5 '' distributions , where @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) is fluence ( peak flux ) and @xmath3 is the number of bursts observed above that fluence ( peak flux ) , was known to exhibit a roll - over at faint fluences and fluxes @xcite .",
    "this paucity of faint events was believed to have arisen from cosmological expansion effects if the faintest bursts originated beyond a redshift @xmath6 .",
    "two major assumptions were required in these studies to extract a meaningful energy scale : first , that grbs are standard candles in peak flux or energy ; and second , that the trigger efficiencies for faint events were known well - enough to correct the observed brightness distributions .",
    "the first assumption was dramatically disproved after redshifts were found for grb 970508 @xcite and grb 971214 @xcite , where the estimated isotropic energy release was 7 @xmath7 erg and 3 @xmath8 erg , respectively . @xcite and @xcite have recently reexamined the log @xmath3-log @xmath5 distributions in the context of known grb redshifts and relax the standard candle assumption .",
    "the measurement of a fluence / flux of a given grb is limited by the sensitivity range ( `` bandpass '' ) of the detector ; thereby , to ascertain the total ( `` bolometric '' ) fluence / flux one needs to extrapolate the observed spectrum outside the detector bandpass .",
    "furthermore , the same grb placed at different cosmological distances would , even after accounting for the 1/@xmath9 dimming , result in different fluence measurements since its co - moving spectrum would be redshifted . in the extreme case ,",
    "a grb originating from a very high redshift might only be detectable in the x - ray bandpass .",
    "therefore , in order to determine the energy of a set of grbs in some common co - moving bandpass , it is not enough to measure the brightness distribution in a common detector bandpass ; instead , one must use the spectra of the grbs themselves to correct for the redshifting effect .    by analogy with a photometric technique often employed in observational cosmology",
    ", we call this correction a @xmath0-correction .",
    "before the first redshifts of grbs were known , @xcite , using the standard candle assumption and the log @xmath3-log @xmath5 distribution , were the first to determine peak fluxes in a common co - moving bandpass using a @xmath0-correction .",
    "later , @xcite used a similar technique using more realistic grb spectra to find the standard candle peak fluxes .",
    "@xcite extended the @xmath0-correction technique to examine the energy scale implied from the log @xmath3-log @xmath4 distribution .",
    "clearly , to begin to understand and model the prompt energy release distribution , we need to determine grb energies in a common co - moving bandpass . in this paper",
    ", we find the @xmath0-corrected energies of grbs with known redshifts in order to homogenize the set of grb energies to a common co - moving bandpass .",
    "the correction methodology , described in  [ sec : method ] , is straightforward when information on the grb spectrum is known .",
    "however , a number of grbs have only a fluence and a redshift published ; to estimate the @xmath0-correction , then , we use an ensemble of template grb spectra , expanding upon the earlier work of @xcite . in  [ sec : results ] we present the @xmath0-corrected energies for 17 cosmological grbs ( plus 6 additional well - studied grbs with an assumed redshift ) in both a co - moving bandpass of 202000 kev and a bolometric bandpass .",
    "we employ a number of tests to show that @xmath0-corrections derived from the template spectra method are robust .",
    "lastly , we point out that by assuming that the total prompt energy release is simply @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the quoted fluence in some detector bandpass , undercounts the bolometric energy release by 5% to 600% , depending on the particular grb .",
    "the relationship of the bolometric energy ( @xmath12 ) to the bolometric fluence ( @xmath13 ) is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the luminosity distance to the source at redshift @xmath16 .",
    "the bolometric fluence is difficult ( if not impossible ) to measure directly .",
    "instead fluence ( energy per unit area ) is typically measured in some detector bandpass bracketed by the energies , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) , for instance , was capable of measuring fluence in the bandpass @xmath19 kev to @xmath20 kev .",
    "we now define this bandpass fluence , @xmath21}$ ] , as @xmath22 } = \\int_{e_1}^{e_2 } e\\ , s_0 \\phi(e ) de,\\ ] ] where the ( time - integrated ) spectral shape of the grb , @xmath23 , and the normalization @xmath24 ( units of photon per unit area per unit energy ) are found from measurements . in general , however , we wish to measure the energy , @xmath25}$ ] , in some fixed co - moving bandpass , bracketed by two arbitrary energies @xmath26 and @xmath27 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath28 } = \\frac{4 \\pi d_l^2}{1+z}\\ , s_{[\\frac{e_1}{1+z},\\frac{e_2}{1+z } ] } \\label{eq : egen}\\ ] ] note that by letting @xmath29 and @xmath30 we recover the bolometric result in equation [ eq : edef ] . in reality , we can only measure , @xmath31}/d \\omega$ ] , the prompt energy release per unit solid angle in the direction of the grb detector .",
    "the energy derived using equation [ eq : egen ] , then , is the `` isotropic - equivalent '' energy release .",
    "that is , @xmath25 } = 4 \\pi\\ , d e_{[e_1 , e_2]}/d \\omega$ ] is the actual energy release if the grb radiates isotropically .",
    "in practice , in order to determine the fluence of a grb , a spectrum is assumed and forward - folded through the detector response to produce a predicted total count for that particular detector ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "the shape and normalization of the spectrum is then found simultaneously by iteration until the predicted counts best matches the raw counts . as such",
    ", there is likely to be some level of covariance between @xmath24 and the parameters of @xmath23 .",
    "however , probably owing to the complex dependence upon the detector responses , these covariances are rarely reported and so , in the subsequent error estimate , we make the simplifying assumption that @xmath23 and the spectrum normalization @xmath24 are uncorrelated .",
    "( we have tested that if the parameters are maximally correlated , then the uncertainty estimate below using the uncorrelated assumption is still reasonably accurate to a factor of @xmath12 ) .",
    "often , only the fluence measure is given and no information about the grb spectrum is provided . when no spectral information is provided in a given reference , we need to make an assumption about the spectrum in order to carry through the analysis above .",
    "since the spectra of grbs are rather diverse in energy cut - off and spectral indices ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is not necessarily sufficient to assume that the spectrum of all grbs are the same , nor are they simple - power laws .",
    "instead , when no spectral information is provided , we assumed that @xmath23 was each of the 54 `` template ''",
    "spectra fit in @xcite and then found the implied isotropic energy release using the grb redshift and fluence measurement .",
    "we take as the estimated energy 1.06 @xmath47 the median energy implied over the ensemble of spectra .",
    "this small numerical correction factor was found empirically by comparing the template spectra @xmath0-corrections to the @xmath0-corrections found using the observed spectral data ( see figure [ fig : encomp ] ) . for the uncertainty in the energy estimate , we add in quadrature the statistical error on the fluence normalization ( term 1 of equation [ eq : theerr ] ) and the r.m.s .  of the energies implied using the ensemble of 54 template spectra after twice cleaning for 3-@xmath48 outliers . as we will demonstrate below (  [ sec : templ ] ) , using the template spectra method reasonably recovers the `` true '' energy of those bursts for which a spectrum is known .",
    "tables [ tab : allspect1 ] and [ tab : allspect2 ] give the results of the @xmath0-corrected energies in the common energy range 20 to 2000 kev and 0.1 kev to 10 mev ( `` bolometric '' ) , respectively , for all published fluence and spectra of 23 grbs with well - studied afterglow .",
    "we assume a cosmology with @xmath49 km s@xmath50 mpc@xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 = 0.7 .",
    "the redshifts of 17 of these grbs are known . in the cases where",
    "no grb redshift has been found ( grb 980329 , grb 980519 , grb 981220 , grb 981226 ) we assume @xmath53 , excepting grb 980326 where we assume @xmath54 ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for completeness ,",
    "we include grb 980425 in the tables , though its association with sn 1998bw ( and hence the implied extremely low redshift ) is still in question ; the subsequent analysis excludes grb 980425 .    in most cases",
    "the average fitted parameters to a band et al .",
    "spectral shape was provided in the respective reference . where the uncertainties in @xmath55 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 are provided , we find the uncertainty in the derived energy using eqns .",
    "( [ eq : theerr])([eq : banderr ] ) .",
    "when no uncertainties were given we assumed ( conservatively ) 10% errors in @xmath55 and @xmath44 and an error of 0.2 in the parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "when no spectral information is given , we use the template spectral method described above to estimate the @xmath0-corrected energy release .",
    "we show the @xmath0-corrected energies of 17 cosmological grbs with confirmed redshifts ( not including grb 980425 ) in figure [ fig : en - v - z ] .",
    "we now demonstrate the robustness of the energy @xmath0-corrections and the adequacy of the template spectral method with several tests .",
    "first , in many cases the same grb was measured by several instruments allowing for an intercomparison of implied energies for a given grb . in 22 out of 25 intercomparisons in table",
    "[ tab : allspect1 ] , the @xmath0-corrected energies agree to within 2-@xmath48 for the same grb .",
    "second , in figure [ fig : encomp ] , we compare the energies of those bursts where spectral information is provided with the energy implied by assuming that no spectral information is provided and instead using the template spectra method to determine the energy . the comparison between the energies derived from the actual spectra and those estimated from the template spectra method",
    "show good agreement within the statistical uncertainties .",
    "third , as illustrated in figure [ fig : encomp ] , there are no apparent systematic discrepancies with redshift , @xmath0-corrected energies , or co - moving bandpass choice .",
    "furthermore , we see no apparent systematic discrepancies with the choice of different cosmologies .",
    "this strengthens our claim that the @xmath0-corrected energies can be robustly determined even without spectral information for a given grb .",
    "implicit in the energy estimate of bursts without published spectral information is the assumption that the template spectra are from representative bursts at the same redshift as the grb in question .",
    "previously , under the standard candle hypothesis , the template spectra were first blueshifted back to the presumed redshift of the particular template burst , then redshifted to the distance of grb in question @xcite .",
    "the reason for this was that the template spectra tended to be of brighter bursts ( _ i.e. _  lower - redshift bursts ) and therefore on the whole , by anzatz , spectrally harder than bursts at higher redshifts .",
    "empirically , as seen in figure [ fig : encomp ] , we have shown that no such redshift - dependent correction is required since the template spectra adequately reproduce the implied energies of those bursts where the spectrum is observationally determined .",
    "this implies that bright ( peak flux ) grbs originate from a large range in redshift , rather than from systematically small redshifts , in agreement with what is already known from grb redshift measurements .",
    "in tables [ tab : ensum1 ] and [ tab : ensum2 ] , we present the implied @xmath0-corrected prompt grb energy releases assuming three different cosmological world models . where multiple fluence / spectral references are available for a given grb we choose the reference with the most detailed analysis where we are most confident in the result .",
    "we emphasize again , however , that the @xmath0-corrected energies of 22 out of 25 multiple - reference grbs are self - consistent , as they should , to within the uncertainties .",
    "we have found the @xmath0-corrected isotropic - equivalent prompt energy release and the associated uncertainties for 17 grbs with redshifts and 6 additional grbs with measured afterglows where we assume a redshift .",
    "our method for determining the @xmath0-correction when no spectral information is known for a particular grbs appears robust ( see figure  [ fig : encomp ] ) . as can be seen in the `` @xmath0 '' column in table [ tab : ensum2 ] , the simple assumption that @xmath56 , where @xmath55 is the observed fluence , systematically undercounts the bolometric energy release by @xmath15% to 600% , depending on the particular grb .",
    "these differences between the @xmath0-corrected energies and the simple uncorrected energies are highlighted in figure [ fig : en - v - z ] where the crosses depict the simple uncorrected energies .",
    "though in many cases the two energies are similar , in some the differences are quite large ( particularly those grbs where fluences were measured in a small bandpass energy range ) . while most @xmath0-corrections are of order unity , the grb energy distribution spans nearly 3 orders of magnitude . as such",
    ", the distribution of uncorrected energies is qualitatively similar to the distribution of @xmath0-corrected energies .    in the future",
    ", most grb fluences will be measured in the energy ranges 40700 kev ( bepposax / grbm ) and 101000 kev ( hete - ii / fregate ) and so it is of interest to know the characteristic @xmath0-correction for these instruments . in figure",
    "[ fig : avgcor ] we show the median @xmath0-correction for several observed bandpass energy ranges as a function of burst redshift and fixed co - moving bandpass .",
    "these median @xmath0-correction curves , which are independent of cosmology , were generated using the template spectral method described herein . in the absence of a reported spectrum , these curves may be used in conjunction with equation [ eq : theken ] to calculate the prompt isotropic - equivalent energy of a burst .",
    "figure [ fig : hist - e ] shows a histogram of the @xmath0-corrected energies of 17 grbs . for a cosmology with @xmath49 km s@xmath50 mpc@xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 = 0.7 , the minimum bolometric grb energy of those grbs with measured redshifts is ( grb 990712 ) and the maximum bolometric energy is erg ( grb 990123 ) .",
    "the median bolometric energy release is ( grb 990510 ) with an r.m.s .",
    "scatter of 0.80 dex .",
    "we emphasize that this analysis of the characteristic @xmath0-corrected energies applies only to the _ observed _ distribution of grbs with redshifts ; several observational biases ( for example , in burst detection and redshift determination ) obscure the true underlying energy distribution .    given that many grbs , from analysis of afterglow , are now believed to be jetted ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the real energy release of a given grb may be substantially less than the isotropic - equivalent energies derived herein . to find the real total prompt energy release one requires an additional correction factor that takes in to account the geometry of the explosion . including geometric corrections",
    ", the distribution of grb energies appears to tighten to a significantly narrower distribution than without the geometric corrections ( such work will be presented elsewhere in @xcite .",
    "this tight distribution , which suggests that grbs may be viable standard candles , underscores the ever - increasing need for accurate spectral and fluence measures as well as an accurate accounting of the order - of - unity @xmath0-corrections .",
