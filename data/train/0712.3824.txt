    "although several substantial improvements have been achieved in understanding the violation mechanism , we are left with several open questions , and an experimental effort is necessary to increase our comprehension .",
    "the @xmath0 sector offers many interesting processes in which large violating effects are possible , some of which have clean theoretical interpretation .",
    "traditionally , @xmath0 physics has been the domain of @xmath5 machines operating at the @xmath6(4s ) resonance ( @xmath4-factories ) or at the @xmath7 pole .",
    "in particular , the recent successful turn on of the babar and belle experiments provided an impressive precision in many experimental measurements .",
    "nevertheless , already in 1990 the ua1 collaboration proved that @xmath0 physics is accessible in an hadron collider environment@xcite , and in 1992 the cdf collaboration published the first signal of fully reconstructed @xmath4 meson decays@xcite .",
    "afterward , the cdf and d  collaborations pursued a successful @xmath0 physics program during the 1992 - 1996 data taking period ( run i ) .    since then the experimental techniques improved significantly , with the development of more precise silicon microvertex detectors and online triggering of tracks from long - lived particles .",
    "the tevatron @xmath8 collider , along with the upgraded collider detector at fermilab ( cdf ii ) and the d  detector , offer today a unique opportunity to study @xmath0 physics .",
    "tevatron results are fully competitive with @xmath4-factories and , in many cases , the tevatron measurements are complementary to those performed at the @xmath4-factories .",
    "we summarize here some of the recent experimental progress in the measurements related to violation and flavor - mixing in the _ beauty _ and _ charmed _ sectors at the tevatron .",
    "charge - conjugate modes are implied throughout all this paper unless otherwise specified .",
    "the tevatron accelerator complex has undergone an extensive upgrade since the end of run i. the major improvement is the replacement of the final injection stage with the main injector , a new 150 gev proton ring which provides more efficient injection and higher proton intensity onto the anti - proton production target production mode , the main injector accelerates protons to 120 gev . ] . in run",
    "ii ( mid-2001 @xmath9 now ) the tevatron accelerates 36 bunches of protons against 36 bunches of anti - protons producing one collision every 396 ns at 1.96 tev centre - of - mass energy . the current centre - of - mass energy , higher than in run i ( 1.8 @xmath10 1.96 tev ) , increases by @xmath11 10 @xmath9 30% the production cross - section for heavy flavors . the luminous regions along the beamline are about 30 cm long ( rms ) , requiring properly designed silicon micro - vertex detectors to provide good coverage .",
    "the transverse beam - width at the collision points is about @xmath12 m ( rms ) .",
    "this is sufficiently small compared to the typical transverse decay length where @xmath13 is the lorentz boost projected onto the plane perpendicular to the beam line ( @xmath14 0.5 @xmath9 2 at tevatron ) and @xmath15 is the proper decay length of the @xmath0-hadron ( @xmath14 450 @xmath16 m ) . ] of @xmath0-hadrons , @xmath17 m , to allow a clean separation of secondary from primary vertices .",
    "the instantaneous luminosity ( @xmath18 ) has been rising steadily since the beginning of run ii .",
    "a factor of two increase has been achieved just during the last year ( march 2003 @xmath9 march 2004 ) up to a record of @xmath19@xmath20s@xmath21 .",
    "the machine regularly exceeds @xmath22@xmath20s@xmath21 typically delivering data corresponding to 10 pb@xmath21/week of integrated luminosity per experiment . at such luminosities on average 1.5 interactions per bunch - crossing",
    "the total integrated luminosity delivered is around 400 pb@xmath21 per experiment but the data taken during the first year were used for machine and detector commissioning .",
    "afterward , about 290 pb@xmath21 of physics quality data have been recorded on tape by each experiment with typical data - taking efficiencies in excess of 85% . the cdf ii results shown in this document used up to 190 pb@xmath21 of data ; the d  results used up to 250 pb@xmath21 of data .",
    "the @xmath0-hadron phenomenology in @xmath2 collisions at 1.96 tev offers several advantages with respect to @xmath23 collisions .",
    "the tevatron @xmath1 production cross - section is very large , @xmath24(100 @xmath16b ) , compared to the typical @xmath5 cross - sections at the @xmath6(4s ) ( @xmath25 nb ) and @xmath7 ( @xmath26 nb ) resonances . typical production rate of @xmath0 quarks at the tevatron is about 5 khz and they are produced mainly , @xmath27~x$ ] , @xmath28~x$ ] , @xmath29~x$ ] and @xmath30~x$ ] are neglected . ]",
    "incoherently in @xmath1 pairs by strong interaction . as a consequence , mixing and violation measurements",
    "can be performed by reconstructing a single @xmath0-hadron in the event , while at @xmath4-factories the flavor of one @xmath4 meson is determined only after observing the decay of the other . moreover , unlike the @xmath4-factories , all species of @xmath0 hadrons are produced at the tevatron , including @xmath3 , @xmath31 and @xmath0-baryons such as @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "however the hadronic environment poses several challenges for the @xmath0-physics .",
    "the very large @xmath1 production cross - section is only about 1/500@xmath34 the total inelastic @xmath2 cross - section , @xmath35 50 mb .",
    "moreover , tevatron events show high ( @xmath36 50 ) track multiplicities , due to the fragmentation of the hard interaction products , to the underlying events ( _ i.e. _ hadronized remnants of @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) and to pile - up events ( multiple collisions per bunch crossing ) . one way to identify @xmath0-decays in such a complicate environment is to exploit the relatively long lifetime of @xmath0-flavors resulting in decay vertices which are separated by hundreds of microns from the primary @xmath2 interaction vertices . in addition , the distribution of the transverse momentum is the particle momentum component perpendicular to the beam line : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the polar angle with respect to the beam axis ( @xmath41 particle collinear with the proton direction ) . ]",
    "( @xmath42 ) of @xmath0-hadrons at the tevatron is a steeply falling function .",
    "most of the @xmath0-hadrons have very low @xmath42 and decay into particles which are typically quite soft , often having @xmath43 gev / c .",
    "this has two consequences : ( 1 ) the need to select tracks as soft as possible conflicts with the limited bandwidth allowed by the data acquisition systems ; ( 2 ) since the longitudinal component of @xmath0-hadrons momentum is frequently very large , they tend to decay into particles boosted along the beam line , thus escaping the detector acceptance . if one @xmath0-quark is central ( pseudorapidity of a particle is defined as @xmath44 . ]",
    "@xmath451 ) , the other one is central only @xmath46 of the time .",
    "a key ingredient for an effective @xmath0-hadron selection and reconstruction at the tevatron is , therefore , an excellent tracking system with reconstructing capability extended to low transverse momenta .",
    "the tracking system should also provide excellent vertexing performances to select long - lived decays that are likely to contain heavy flavors . finally , it is necessary a selective trigger and data acquisition system capable to sustain the high rates associated with this physics . in the following section we outline some of the relevant aspects of the cdf ii and d  detectors and triggers .",
    "the cdf ii and d  detectors are large multipurpose solenoidal magnetic spectrometers surrounded by @xmath47 calorimetry and muon filters .",
    "they are axially and azimuthally symmetric around the interaction point and their strengths are somewhat complementary to one another .",
    "d  has a excellent tracking acceptance and very good @xmath48 and @xmath16 identification performance .",
    "cdf ii features very precise tracking that provides excellent mass resolution and has strong particle identification capabilities .",
    "additional details of the detectors can be found elsewhere@xcite@xcite .",
    "[ [ ssec : d0 ] ] d ~~    the d  tracking volume consists of an inner silicon detector surrounded by a scintillating fiber tracker both immersed in a 2 t solenoidal field with 52 cm total lever arm . the fiber tracker covers the region @xmath49 , the silicon detector is organized in longitudinal barrels interspersed with azimuthal disks which extend the forward tracking to @xmath50 .",
    "tracks with transverse momentum as low as 180 mev / c are reconstructed .",
    "the uranium / liquid - argon calorimeter has very good energy resolution for @xmath48 , @xmath51 and hadronic jets and features pre - shower counters to improve @xmath52 discrimination .",
    "the muon system covers @xmath53 for muons with @xmath54 gev / c .",
    "the cdf ii tracking system consists of an inner silicon system surrounded by a gas - wire drift chamber both immersed in a 1.4 t field with 135 cm total lever arm .",
    "six to seven double - sided silicon layers , plus one single - sided layer , cover the full tevatron luminous region ( @xmath53 ) and extend radially from 1.6 to 28 cm from the beam line .",
    "the drift chamber provides 96 ( 48 axial plus 48 stereo ) samplings of track paths within @xmath55 .",
    "tracking information is integrated with muon ( reconstructed at @xmath56 ) and calorimeter ( @xmath53 ) data for @xmath16 and @xmath57hadron identification . low - momentum particle identification ( pid ) is performed using a scintillator - based time - of - flight detector ( tof ) with 110 ps resolution that provides @xmath58 k/@xmath59 separation at @xmath60 gev / c .",
    "the specific ionization information from the drift chamber ( _ de / dx _ ) complements the pid with 1.4@xmath61 k/@xmath59 separation for tracks with @xmath62 gev / c .",
    "the trigger system is probably the single most important ingredient to pursue an effective _ b _ physics program at the tevatron .",
    "both cdf ii and d  have a multi - stage trigger system organized in three levels .",
    "cdf ii has a data acquisition system faster than d , allowing for a higher level 1 accept trigger rate , while d  has level 2 accept rate higher than cdf ii .",
    "past experience from run i suggests that triggering on final states containing single or di - leptons is a successful strategy to select high statistics samples of @xmath0-hadron decays . semi - leptonic @xmath63 plus charmonium @xmath64x$ ] decays are @xmath65 of @xmath4 meson widths . both cdf ii and d  adapted such a _ `` conventional '' _ approach to the upgraded detectors .",
    "in addition cdf ii has a new capability to select events based upon track impact parameter is the minimum distance between the track projection and the primary vertex in the plane transverse to the beam . ] .",
    "the following subsections describe the main features of the triggers oriented to @xmath0-physics .",
    "identification of di - muon events down to very low momentum is possible , allowing for efficient @xmath66 and rare - decays triggers .",
    "both experiments trigger upon @xmath67 decays , 15% of which come from @xmath0-hadrons , and then fully reconstruct several useful decay modes such as @xmath68[k^+k^-]$ ] .",
    "although cdf ii and d  results shown here use only di - muon modes , future analyses will include data collected through di - electron triggers .",
    "+ d  has an inclusive muon trigger with excellent acceptance , that collects very large samples of semileptonic decays .",
    "the cdf ii semileptonic triggers require an additional displaced track associated with the lepton , providing cleaner samples with smaller yields and are described in the next subsection .",
    "trigger thresholds are summarized in table  [ tab : trigger ] .",
    "a revolutionary feature of cdf ii is the ability to trigger events containing tracks originated in a vertex displaced from the primary .",
    "these events are enriched in heavy flavor contents , thanks to the higher mean - valued lifetimes of @xmath0-hadrons . the cdf ii silicon vertex trigger ( svt)@xcite identifies displaced tracks by measuring their impact parameter with an intrinsic resolution @xmath16 m determines the total impact parameter resolution : @xmath69 @xmath16 m . ]",
    "@xmath70 35 @xmath16 m .",
    "such a high accuracy is required to discriminate @xmath0-decays from background tracks and can be reached only using the silicon information .",
    "the experimental challenge is to read - out the silicon detector and perform pattern recognition while sustaining the high trigger rate . in a typical latency of 25 @xmath16s / event",
    ", svt reconstructs with offline - quality two - dimensional tracks ( in the plane transverse to the beam ) by combining the drift chamber information with the silicon hits .",
    "two trigger strategies exploit displaced tracks .",
    "the _ `` lepton + displaced track '' _ trigger requires a displaced track associated to an electron ( or muon ) to select very clean samples of semileptonic @xmath0 decays .",
    "the _ `` two track '' _ trigger requires only two displaced tracks and selects exclusive non - leptonic @xmath0-decays for the first time in an hadronic collider .",
    "this trigger accumulates large and clean samples of several modes relevant for violation and flavor mixing physics such as @xmath71 , @xmath72\\pi^+\\rightarrow[[k^+k^-]\\pi^-]\\pi^+$ ] and large _ charmed _ samples as well .",
