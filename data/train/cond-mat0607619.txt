    "one of the many interesting consequences of recent experimental advances in the field of cold atoms is the fact that it is now possible to realize states of reduced dimensionality .",
    "more precisely , so long as the energy of the atoms due to their interactions is much smaller than the spacing of the energy levels associated with motion along some symmetry axis of the trap , the atomic state is dominated by the lowest state of the trapping potential , and this degree of freedom is effectively frozen .",
    "thus , oblate / elongated traps can be used to achieve quasi - two / quasi - one dimensional behavior . as reported in ref.@xcite , ketterle and co -",
    "workers have achieved quasi - one - dimensional conditions . using a variety of sophisticated techniques , experimentalists have produced traps spanning a wide range of other geometries , as reported in , e.g. , refs.@xcite .",
    "several experimental and theoretical groups have also studied quasi - one - dimensional bose - einstein condensates in magnetic waveguides @xcite . in a detailed study",
    ", leboeuf and pavloff have considered the effects of perturbing obstacles on the propagation of bose - einstein condensed atoms through such magnetic waveguides @xcite .    in the present study we focus on tight toroidal trapping potentials , which have been realized in various laboratories @xcite .",
    "such traps can be used to create one - dimensional systems satisfying periodic boundary conditions . since",
    "such systems have been under investigation for decades , it is clear that they are interesting from a theoretical point of view .",
    "further , they may have numerous technological applications .    in a one - dimensional toroidal trap , the atomic density is homogeneous if the effective interaction between the atoms is repulsive @xcite .",
    "it has been shown , however , that for a sufficiently strong attractive interaction , the atoms undergo a second - order quantum phase transition and form a localized density distribution @xcite .",
    "( this stands in contrast to a three - dimensional gas , which simply collapses . ) in the inhomogeneous phase the atoms benefit from the formation of a localized `` blob '' , which lowers their interaction energy .",
    "the issue to be considered here is the effect of a controlled change in the trapping potential @xmath0 along the torus as a consequence of small transverse irregularities .",
    "we will see that even small irregularities can materially alter this simple picture of localization .",
    "the effects to be considered were first encountered in early studies of radar .",
    "hot spots were observed wherever waveguides were bent .",
    "it was soon recognized that any such non - uniformity in a quasi one - dimensional waveguide necessarily leads to exponentially localized , subthreshold resonances ( i.e. , bound states ) with a correspondingly high local energy density .    in sec.ii",
    "we describe the problem to be considered in greater detail , and we present our model in sec.iii .",
    "section iv contains our results for the ground state and the excitation spectrum of the gas .",
    "section v contains a discussion of our results and presents the conclusions of this study .",
    "one might imagine that small irregularities in the one - dimensional potential , @xmath0 , do not have any substantial effect .",
    "the situation is very different in the quasi one - dimensional systems considered here .",
    "consider first a free particle moving in an infinitely long waveguide of small transverse size .",
    "the wave function for this particle can be approximated as the product of the lowest transverse eigenfunction and a function of the distance along the waveguide .",
    "the associated eigenvalue of the transverse hamiltonian provides an effective potential for the resulting one - dimensional motion .",
    "a localized broadening ( or , equivalently , a bend ) of an otherwise uniform waveguide will thus result in an attractive effective potential .",
    "it is familiar from elementary quantum mechanics that every purely attractive potential in one dimension has at least one exponentially bound state .",
    "the ubiquity of bound states in infinite waveguides has been investigated thoroughly in an elegant paper by goldstone and jaffe @xcite .",
    "the situation is extremely similar for the toroidal geometry considered here .",
    "construct @xmath0 using the same ansatz for the wave function , and set the zero of the energy as the maximum value of @xmath0 . assuming a constant longitudinal wave function",
    ", an elementary variational calculation immediately shows that the ground state energy of this system is necessarily negative if @xmath0 is non - uniform .",
    "there will always be classically allowed and forbidden regions with the usual attendant exponential enhancement or suppression of the ground state wave function .    for zero or weak interactions ,",
    "the order parameter for the atomic system is simply the eigenfunction of the lowest energy state , and it is exponentially localized / delocalized , too .",
    "thus , even small irregularities in @xmath0 in such one - dimensional systems render instability to an inhomogeneous state inevitable , provided only that the interaction is not too strong .",
    "contrary to the quantum phase transition induced by an attractive effective interaction in a uniform toroidal trap , irregularities require a sufficiently strong and repulsive interaction for the density to be ( nearly ) homogeneous .",
    "furthermore , while the density variation induced by an attractive interaction in the uniform case is sinusoidal close to the transition point , irregularities in @xmath0 result in an exponential localization / delocalization , which is generally more pronounced .",
    "to demonstrate these effects quantitatively , we consider the following form of @xmath0 : @xmath1 which corresponds to a broadening of the torus over 10% of its circumference . we assume the usual contact potential for the atom - atom interaction , @xmath2 with @xmath3 . here , @xmath4 is the scattering length for elastic atom - atom collisions and @xmath5 is the atomic mass .",
    "the hamiltonian of the quasi - one - dimensional system thus becomes @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the number of atoms .",
    "the prefactor of the last term , @xmath8 , is equal to @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the ( three - dimensional ) density , @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the radius of the torus , and @xmath13 its cross section , with @xmath14 .",
    "the three energy scales that appear in our problem , are then ( i ) the energy for motion along the torus @xmath15 , ( ii ) the depth of the potential @xmath16 , and ( iii ) the interaction energy between the atoms , @xmath17 .    for @xmath18",
    ", one finds an instability towards the formation of a localized state induced by an attractive interaction when @xmath19 .",
    "more precisely , the critical value of the ratio , @xmath20 , between the potential energy @xmath21 and the kinetic energy @xmath22 , is @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "finally , the crossover between the phases of localized and homogeneous density that we consider here is given roughly by the condition @xmath24 .",
    "of eq.([op ] ) for three values of the coupling constant @xmath25 , and 5.0 , and for @xmath0 given by eq.([potential ] ) .",
    "the two vertical lines show the range of the potential @xmath0.,title=\"fig:\",width=264,height=158 ]   of eq.([op ] ) for three values of the coupling constant @xmath25 , and 5.0 , and for @xmath0 given by eq.([potential ] ) .",

    "to determine the order parameter @xmath26 , we first solve the eigenvalue problem @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the hamiltonian of the non - interacting problem .",
    "the eigenstates @xmath29 are parity eigenstates .",
    "the actual value of @xmath16 that we choose is @xmath30 in units of @xmath22 , and it has only one bound state with an energy @xmath31 . except for this lowest ( @xmath32 ) eigenvalue ,",
    "the eigenvalues of all the excited states are quite close to those of the undistorted torus , i.e. , @xmath33 clearly , this expression becomes more accurate for larger values of @xmath34 .",
    "having solved the eigenvalue problem , we then expand the order parameter in the eigenstates @xmath29 , @xmath35 and calculate the coefficients @xmath36 variationally .",
    "for each value of the coupling constant @xmath20 considered , we minimize the expectation value of the hamiltonian subject to the constraint @xmath37 corresponding to a fixed number of atoms .    figure 1 shows @xmath38 for three values of @xmath39 , and 5.0 , where we kept the lowest five states ( of even parity  only even parity states contribute to @xmath40 ) .",
    "the highest eigenstate , with quantum number @xmath41 , that must be included in the expansion of the order parameter has to satisfy the condition @xmath42 .",
    "this condition is comfortably met even for the largest interaction strength @xmath43 considered , since @xmath44 .    for small values of the interaction energy , @xmath45 ,",
    "the dominant component of the order parameter is the lowest eigenstate of the single - particle problem .",
    "this is an exponentially decaying state in the classically forbidden regions of the torus , @xmath46 .",
    "clearly , a similar result will be obtained for any non - uniform choice of @xmath0 .",

    "the excitations are single - particle like .",
    "atoms are excited from the eigenstate of the non - interacting problem with quantum number @xmath32 to some excited state with quantum number @xmath51 . in the absence of interactions the corresponding excitation energies are approximately equal to the quadratic law of eq.([ene ] ) .    for weak interactions ( @xmath52 )",

    "the excitation energies of the first two excited states ( i.e. , the even and odd parity states with @xmath59 ) are @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively . clearly for large enough @xmath62",
    "the excitation spectrum is quadratic . on the other hand , for the low - lying excited states there are deviations from the quadratic dependence due to the interactions , and also due to the deviations of the eigenenergies from the formula of eq.([ene ] ) , which are more pronounced for low @xmath34 .",
    "the opposite limit of strong interactions , @xmath63 , is more straightforward . even in the presence of some @xmath0 the density tends towards homogeneity in this limit ( as shown in the top panel of fig.1 ) .",
    "the excitation spectrum of the homogeneous state , @xmath64 , is @xcite @xmath65 for @xmath63 the above formula implies that @xmath66 scales as @xmath62 in our problem , @xmath67 the above equation implies a speed of sound @xmath68 , or @xmath69 .",
    "this result can also be obtained from the energy per unit length , @xmath70 , according to the formula @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the atom density per unit length . in the limit of strong interactions , where @xmath73 , the quadratic contribution to @xmath70 is given by the interaction energy , i.e. , the last term in the hamiltonian @xmath74 of eq.([ham1 ] ) , @xmath75 .",
    "thus , @xmath76 , in agreement with eq.([dr ] ) .",
    "depending on the various parameters and on the experimental demands in constructing axially - symmetric toroidal traps , it is possible to explore relevant parts of the phase diagram of quasi one - dimensional atomic gases .",
    "we have pointed out , however , that the ground state of an atom in a toroidal trap will always have some degree of exponential localization whenever the trapping potential deviates from perfect uniformity .",
    "although we have illustrated this fact with one specific form of @xmath0 , the result is general .",
    "even apparently small modulations in @xmath0 can give rise to the localization demonstrated here and have the potential to obscure the quantum phase transition described above for an effective attractive interaction between the atoms .",
    "furthermore , the excitation spectrum is also affected by the presence of some variation in @xmath0 .",
    "more specifically , this is free - particle - like for zero or sufficiently weak interactions , and it is phonon - like for sufficiently strong interactions .",
    "our study leads to three conclusions : ( i ) in realistic toroidal traps , even weak irregularities can result in a density distribution that is exponentially localized .",
    "care must therefore be exercised in comparing experimental results with theoretical predictions assuming a uniform trapping potential .",
    "( ii ) the excitation spectrum ( and thus the dynamics ) of the gas is also affected by variations in @xmath0 , and caution is again called for .",
    "( iii ) the controlled modification of the toroidal potential and/or tuning of the coupling constant of the atomic interaction permit engineering of the shape of the atom density in a rather dramatic way .",
    "for example , the creation in the torus of a potential resembling our @xmath0 ( e.g. , using a laser ) can change the density distribution from almost homogeneous to highly localized . since such modifications of toroidal traps",
    "can be made with relative ease and that the coupling between the atoms is easily tunable via feshbach resonances , our results may have useful applications .",
