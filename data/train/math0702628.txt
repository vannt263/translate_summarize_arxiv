    "the study of @xmath0-borel fixed ideals is a very interesting and fascinating problem .",
    "one could safely argue that in characteristic @xmath0 very few results are known , in contrast to the case of characteristic zero , where we can describe a minimal graded free resolution of any borel fixed ideal , determine its regularity , find its graded betti numbers and more .",
    "it was conjectured in @xcite that the regularity @xmath2 of a principal @xmath0-borel ideal @xmath3 is equal to the maximum of some numbers given by a rather complicated formula . in @xcite",
    "it was proved that @xmath2 is larger than or equal to this maximum , while in @xcite the authors prove the opposite inequality ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "another known result is the computation in @xcite of the koszul homology of some _ special _ @xmath0-borel ideals , which we shall define below , while a more recent result is their cw - resolution given in @xcite using algebraic discrete morse theory . in both papers",
    "there are proofs of a formula that gives their regularity , which agrees with pardue s formula for principal @xmath0-borel ideals .    here",
    "we show how one can use the horseshoe lemma to get the form of the minimal graded free resolution of these _ special _ @xmath0-borel ideals in an elementary way .",
    "furthermore , we verify pardue s regularity formula at the same time .",
    "our idea was born from the observation of the betti diagrams of several such ideals in macaulay 2 @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows :    in section 2 , we introduce the _ reduced horseshoe resolution _ , which will help us deduce the minimal graded free resolution of @xmath4 from the minimal resolutions of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , when the pair @xmath7 of ideals in @xmath8 satisfies certain properties .",

    "we call such ideals _ special_. in particular , if @xmath15 for @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath0 is prime , we call them _ special _ @xmath0-borel ideals .    in section 4 , we construct a polyhedral cell complex that supports a minimal free resolution of some special ( @xmath0-borel ) ideals .    finally ,",
