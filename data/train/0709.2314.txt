    "an intriguing phenomenon in diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) is the formation of bound magnetic polarons @xcite .",
    "the bound magnetic polaron ( bmp ) is a local ordering of magnetic moments induced by the exchange interaction with a localized carrier .",
    "most bmp studies , both experimental and theoretical , have been performed so far in a regime of the mean - field approach ( when @xmath4 ) @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath5 is the concentration of magnetic ions , @xmath6 is the concentration of cations , and @xmath7 is the localization radius .",
    "this approach implies that the localized carrier interacts with a infinite number of @xmath8 ions , and hence it is typically applicable for high and moderate manganese concentrations ( @xmath9 ) . at present systems with a countable number of magnetic moments",
    "attract growing interest @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to the very dilute regime @xmath10 , i.e. when on average one carrier interacts with one ( or few ) mn ion(s ) .",
    "clearly , at this condition the mean - field approach is not an appropriate model .    up to now bound magnetic polarons",
    "have not been observed in a very dilute regime .",
    "this is because their observation requires the polaron formation time @xmath11 to be shorter than the life time @xmath12 of nonequilibrium carriers , @xmath13 . in dms with @xmath14 this condition is fulfilled .",
    "however , in samples with lower mn concentrations @xmath15 the polaron formation time is of the order @xmath16  s @xcite .",
    "therefore , the bmp formation process is interrupted by exciton recombination ( with characteristic time @xmath17",
    "s ) @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study bmp in bulk @xmath0 samples with very low mn concentration ( @xmath1 ) , i.e. at the condition @xmath10 . in order to avoid the above problem of bmp detection in the very dilute regime we use resonant ( selective ) excitation of donor - acceptor ( da ) pairs with transition energies @xcite @xmath18 here , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the binding energies of donors and acceptors respectively",
    ", @xmath21 is the band gap and @xmath22 is the dielectric constant in @xmath0 . as follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq_da ] ) by changing the excitation energy @xmath23 one can selectively excite pairs with a given da separation @xmath24 . because of the weak overlap [ @xmath25 of the donor and acceptor wavefunctions , the pairs with large @xmath24 are characterized by a long recombination time @xmath26 . as a result the bound magnetic polaron forms before the recombination occurs . without polaronic effects such resonantly excited pairs",
    "should manifest themselves in emission spectra as a narrow line of width within either the inverse recombination time ( @xmath27 ) or the laser line width .",
    "the bulk @xmath0 samples with mn concentrations @xmath28 have been grown by the bridgman technique .",
    "the crystals are nominally undoped .",
    "the concentration of residual impurities ( both donors and acceptors ) is about @xmath29  @xmath30 , which is much lower than the mn concentration @xmath31 . as grown crystals are usually p - type due to excess of te or cd - vacancies .",
    "note , for acceptors with the bohr radius @xmath32   and @xmath33 ( @xmath34   @xmath30 ) the relationship is @xmath35 . in the experiments we used @xmath36  mm pieces cleaved out along the ( 110 ) plane from the massive monocrystals .",
    "all measurements were carried out at a temperature @xmath37  k. external magnetic fields were applied either perpendicular to the sample plane ( faraday geometry ) or in the sample plane ( voigt geometry ) .",
    "the photoluminescence ( pl ) was excited by a he - ne laser or a tunable ti - sapphire laser pumped by an ar - ion laser .",
    "the excitation density was about 5  @xmath38 .",
    "the laser beam was directed onto the samples at the angle close to the normal ( axis [ 110 ] ) , and the emission was registered in the backscattering geometry .",
    "a polarizer ( in combination with a quater - wave plate ) was ( were ) used to linearly ( circularly ) polarize the excitation .",
    "the degree of pl polarization was detected with use of a photo - elastic modulator and a two - channel photon counter .",

    "we found qualitatively very similar behavior in all samples studied . in the following we present experimental results for one piece cleaved out from the bulk @xmath44 sample .",
    "figure  [ fig1](a ) shows the pl spectrum excited above the cdte band gap @xmath21 ( he - ne laser with @xmath39  ev ) .",
    "the high - energy line ( x ) is attributed to the bound exciton . at low - energy part of the pl spectrum we observe a broad band associated with recombination of da pairs and its phonon replicas .",
    "these replicas are separated by 20.5  mev , which corresponds to the lo - phonon energy in cdte @xcite .",
    "application of external magnetic fields in faraday geometry results in in the circularly polarized emission already in low fields [ fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) ] .",
    "such a behavior is typical for magnetic semiconductors .",
    "figure  [ fig1](d ) demonstrates the degree of circular polarization vs magnetic field detected at the da band .",
    "it saturates rapidly on a 75% level .    in order to study bound magnetic polarons",
    "we use the site selective spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "we resonantly excite da pairs and record bmp spectra shifted towards lower energies with respect to the excitation energy @xmath40 ( the stokes shift ) .",
    "a set of pl spectra for different @xmath40 is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "a new emission band ( indicated by arrows ) , being observed on the top of the da photoluminescence , clearly follows the laser line which is a fingerprint of the bmp formation .",
    "the most pronounced results have been obtained for @xmath45  ev , as also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . in order to avoid scattered light from the laser we detect such bmp spectra at the first phonon replica .    in zero magnetic field",
    "the bmp spectrum represents itself as an asymmetric band with the 5-mev - tail towards low energies [ fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) ] .",
    "our estimations ( given below ) show that this value is in agreement with the bmp energy as well as with its root - mean - square fluctuations .",
    "such a behavior is an essential deviation from the case of high mn concentrations ( @xmath4 ) , where the stokes shift is larger than the line width , giving rise to a distinct emission line shifted from the excitation by the bmp energy @xcite .",

    "( d ) bmp spectrum obtained in magnetic field @xmath43  t applied in voigt geometry when the polarization axis of the excitation ( @xmath46 ) is parallel to the field direction ( @xmath47(a ) ] .",
    "a new line appears at the resonant energy ( i.e. , there is no stokes shift at all ) @xcite . with growing magnetic field the amplitude of this line increases and the width reduces greatly .",
    "in strong enough magnetic fields ( @xmath48  t ) the width saturates on a @xmath2-@xmath3-level [ see also fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) ] .",
    "the circular polarization of this line is about 65% , and its dependence on the magnetic field [ fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) ] follows that for the da emission under nonresonant excitation [ fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) ] . one more lineament of this new line : its intensity reduces under excitation by the light being linearly polarized along the magnetic field direction applied in voigt geometry [ see fig .",
    "[ fig2](d ) ] .",
    "however , a deviation of the field direction from the sample plane or the polarization axis from the field direction restores the amplitude of this line .        as we show in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , the evolution of pl spectra presented in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) can not be described in terms of the mean - field theory , and hence this requires an alternative approach .",
    "first , we discuss the asymmetric band observed in zero magnetic field .",
    "resonant excitation generates da pairs with a certain energy @xmath49 depending on donor - acceptor separation @xmath24 [ pairs ( i ) and ( iii ) in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) ] . da pairs with transition energies different from the excitation energy @xmath50 are not excited [ pair ( ii ) in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) ] .",
    "the observation of the asymmetric band in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) we attribute to the bmp formation accompanied by relaxation to the ground state .",
    "the dominant contribution to the polaron shift arises from the hole .",
    "this is because the absolute value of the @xmath51-@xmath52 exchange constant is larger than the absolute value of the @xmath53-@xmath52 exchange , and the bohr radius of the acceptor is smaller than that of the donor @xcite . in this approach",
    "the line width is explained by the dispersion of the polaron shifts induced by static fluctuations of mn concentration .",
    "for instance , pair ( iii ) in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) shows a larger polaron shift than pair ( i ) .",
    "because on average less than one mn falls into the volume restricted by the acceptor bohr radius , the root - mean - square fluctuations appear to be comparable with the polaron shift .",
    "its value can be estimated from the line width in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , @xmath54  mev .",
    "strong enough magnetic fields suppress the polaron formation @xcite , and one would expect the disappearance of the low - energy tail .",
    "however , our experiments show the opposite behavior : this tail preserves and a new narrow intense line appears .",
    "we suggest the following explanation .",
    "acceptor ( donor ) states are split in an external magnetic field .",
    "the photon absorption by the fixed da pair leads to the population of one of the zeeman sublevels [ fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) ] . relaxation from the higher - lying sublevels to the lowest sublevel [ pairs ( v ) and ( vi ) in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) ] results in the low - energy tail .",
    "the characteristic width of this tail does not change with magnetic fields because the zeeman splittings disperse in the same manner as the polaron shifts , i.e. due to the static fluctuations of the mn concentration . in case when the lowest zeeman sublevel of da pairs is excited [ pair ( iv ) in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) ] a further relaxation is not possible , and the narrow line is observed at the excitation energy . with growing magnetic fields the width of this line should decrease and saturate in fields when the magnetization of magnetic ions saturates ( @xmath48  t ) .",
    "it is now clear why the narrow peak is suppressed when the polarization axis of the excitation light is exact parallel to the magnetic field direction : due to optical selection rules the excitation to the ground state [ pair ( iv ) in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) ] is forbidden in this configuration .",
    "however , even a small deviation from this geometry restores the perpendicular - to - field component of the polarization vector , and the peak rises up .",
    "in order to calculate the pl spectra under selective excitation one needs to find the distribution function of the stokes shift induced by the polaron formation in zero magnetic field . on the other hand , in case of strong magnetic fields the distribution function is determined by the zeeman splitting dispersion . the hole ( electron ) spins interact with mn ions via the @xmath51-@xmath52 ( @xmath53-@xmath52 ) exchange interaction . in case of localized carriers",
    "this interaction can be written as @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the electron and hole spin operators , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are their wavefunctions , respectively .",
    "@xmath60 is the spin operator of the @xmath61-th mn ion , and @xmath62 is a radius - vector assigning mn location in the crystal .",
    "the exchange constants in @xmath0 are @xmath63  @xmath64 and @xmath65  @xmath66 .",
    "the donor and acceptor bohr radii are equal approximately 60   and 10   , respectively .",
    "this implies that the spin splitting of the mn ion removed by the bohr radius from the acceptor ( donor ) is 1.28  mev ( 1.5  @xmath3 ) . in other words , at a temperature @xmath37  k ( @xmath67  mev ) the electron contribution can be neglected , and all mn spins in the vicinity of the acceptor are aligned along the exchange field of the hole .",
    "the hole exchange energy in the ground state is @xmath68 .",
    "its mean value averaged over all mn configurations is @xmath69 , where @xmath70  @xmath71 is a concentration of cations .",
    "for @xmath72 it is equal @xmath73  mev . the root - mean - square fluctuation @xmath74 is equal @xmath75  mev . and the mean value of the hole energy in the fluctuating fields of nonpolarized mn ions @xmath76 is equal @xmath77  mev .",
    "it follows from these estimations that the fluctuations of the exchange energy and its mean value are nearly the same . therefore the gaussian statistics and , as consequence , the mean - field approach is not applicable .    in case of low mn concentrations",
    "it is difficult to obtain an analytical solution for the stokes shift distribution function .",
    "therefore , in order to calculate the pl spectra under selective excitation we use numerical computing based on the monte - carlo method .",
    "first , a random distribution of magnetic ions in a sphere with a radius equal to ten acceptor bohr radii @xmath78 is generated [ see also fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) ] @xcite .",
    "each mn ion has a random spin orientation in accordance with the equilibrium distribution for a given temperature and magnetic field strength .",
    "then , the total exchange field acting on the hole bound to the acceptor placed in the center of the sphere is calculated .",
    "after that , the eigenstates of the hole in this total exchange field and the transition probabilities on these states are evaluated .",
    "polaron energies are determined for each generated mn distribution by adding the exchange filed of the hole acting on mn ions to the external magnetic field .",
    "the stokes shift is calculated as an energy difference between the initial and final states .",
    "finally the distribution function of the stokes shift is obtained after summation over 50000 realizations .",
    "the calculated pl spectra for different magnetic fields are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) .",
    "not only qualitative but also quantitative agreement with experimental data [ compare with fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) ] is achieved .",
    "note , no fitting parameters are used in the calculation .        because of low mn - ion count in the vicinity of the acceptor ( on average",
    "there are 0.3 mn ions inside the sphere of radius @xmath7 ) it is natural to assume that the nearest mn ions give dominant contributions to the stokes shifts [ fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) ] .",
    "we now consider this approach in details . in an external magnetic field",
    "the hole states are split in four sublevels characterized by the different projection @xmath79 of the hole angular momentum on the field direction .",
    "one of them with @xmath80 is a ground state .",
    "the contribution to the pl spectra from this state is a delta function @xmath81 ( if neglecting native homogeneous broadening ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) [ pair ( iv ) ] . excitation in one of three other states is followed by relaxation to the ground state [ pairs ( v ) and ( vi ) in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) ] .",
    "therefore , the shift of the emission energy with respect to the excitation energy is described by the distribution function of the nearest ( to the hole ) mn ion , @xmath82 . then , under unpolarized excitation the distribution function @xmath83 of the skokes shift @xmath84 is written as @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the probabilities to excite the hole with @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively . and the characteristic exchange energy is @xmath90  mev . the probability @xmath91 that the nearest mn ion is located in the spherical layer ( @xmath92,@xmath93 ) [ see fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) ] is given by the probability to find one mn ion in this spherical layer being equal to @xmath94 , and the probability that there are no mn ions inside the sphere of radius @xmath92 being equal to @xmath95 .",
    "here , @xmath95 is the poisson distribution @xmath96 with @xmath97 and @xmath98",
    ". then one writes @xmath99 recall , the energy of the exchange interaction between the hole and mn ion depends on a distance @xmath92 as @xmath100 , i.e. @xmath101 and @xmath102 . finally , one obtains the distribution function vs energy @xmath84 as @xmath103 @xmath104 \\ , , \\label{eq5}\\ ] ] with @xmath105 .",
    "figure  [ fig5](a ) shows that the nearest - mn approach describes well the pl spectra in high magnetic fields .",
    "however , the agreement becomes worse for small @xmath84 in zero magnetic field , while the high - energy tail is still described quite well .",
    "the reason is that for the complex hole + nearest - mn ion the relaxation is not possible at the excitation to the ground state , and the stokes shift is absent .",
    "this results in a @xmath106-function peak appearing in zero as well as in high magnetic fields [ first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) ] . in real the contribution to",
    "the stokes shift for @xmath107 arises from several distant ( @xmath108 ) mn ions . in weak magnetic fields",
    "the spins of these distant ions are disordered , and their orientation induced by the exchange field of the hole results in the energy lowering . in strong magnetic fields",
    "the spins are already oriented at the moment of excitation , further relaxation does not occur , which manifests itself as the appearance of the narrow peak at @xmath109 .",
    "with use of the site selective spectroscopy of residual da pairs in bulk @xmath0 samples we are able to observe the formation of bound magnetic polarons in a very dilute ( @xmath110 ) regime . under selective excitation",
    "the pl spectra show an asymmetric band with low - energy tail and the additional very narrow peak inflaming in external magnetic fields .",
    "this behavior can not be described in terms of the mean - field approach , frequently applied to diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) .",
    "our findings suggest that the low - energy tail is formed due to the exchange interaction of the hole ( bound to the acceptor ) with the nearest mn ion , and is described by the poisson distribution .",
    "unexpectedly , the dominant contribution to the narrow peak arises from the interaction with several mn ions remote from the hole .",
