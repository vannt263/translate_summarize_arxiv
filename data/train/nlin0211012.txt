    "low - dimensional time - discrete maps are among the most important models for exploring different aspects of chaos .",
    "these systems display a very rich dynamical behavior but are still very amenable to straightforward computer simulations .",
    "even more , in some cases rigorous analytical solutions are possible . after it was realized that diffusion processes can be generated by microscopic deterministic chaos in the equations of motion , time - discrete maps became useful tools in deterministic transport theory .",
    "the analysis of these simple models required to suitably combine nonequilibrium statistical mechanics with dynamical systems theory leading to a more profound understanding of transport in nonequilibrium situations @xcite . however , time - discrete maps provide not only a suitable starting point for studying normal diffusion but also for investigating the anomalous case @xcite .",
    "moreover , there are certain classes of more realistic models which share specific properties of maps such as being low - dimensional and exhibiting certain periodicities .",
    "indeed , theoretical investigations of chaotic billiards subject to external fields @xcite , of periodic lorentz gases @xcite , and of pendulum - like differential equations @xcite showed that many properties of deterministic transport in maps carry over to these more complex chaotic dynamical systems .    in this framework , recently a new feature of deterministic diffusion was discovered . for simple one - dimensional hyperbolic maps",
    "it was shown that the diffusion coefficient is typically a fractal function of control parameters @xcite .",
    "subsequently an analogous behavior was detected for other transport coefficients @xcite , and in more complicated models @xcite .",
    "however , up to now the fractality of transport coefficients could be assessed for hyperbolic systems only , whereas , to our knowledge , the fractal nature of classical transport coefficients in the broad class of nonhyperbolic systems was not discussed .",
    "on the other hand , studying nonhyperbolic dynamics appears to be more relevant in order to connect fractal transport coefficients to some known experiments .",
    "here we think particularly of dissipative systems driven by periodic forces such as josephson junctions in the presence of microwave radiation @xcite , superionic conductors @xcite , and systems exhibiting charge - density waves @xcite in which certain features of deterministic diffusion were already observed experimentally . for these systems",
    "the equations of motion are typically of the form of some nonlinear pendulum equation . in the limiting case of strong dissipation",
    "they can be reduced to nonhyperbolic one - dimensional time - discrete maps sharing certain symmetries @xcite .",
    "the so - called climbing sine map is a well - known example of this class of maps @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we pursue a detailed analysis of the diffusive and dynamical properties of the climbing sine map . particularly , we show that the nonhyperbolicity of this map does not destroy the fractal characteristics of deterministic diffusive transport as they were found in hyperbolic systems . on the contrary ,",
    "fractal structures appear for normal diffusive parameters as well as for anomalous diffusive regions .",
    "we argue that higher - order memory effects are crucial to understand the origin of these fractal hierarchies in this nonhyperbolic system . by using a green - kubo formula for diffusion ,",
    "the dynamical correlations are recovered in terms of fractal takagi - like functions .",
    "these functions appear as solutions of a generalized integro - differential de rham - type equation .",
    "we furthermore show that the distribution of periodic windows exhibiting anomalous diffusion forms devil s staircase like structures as a function of the parameter and that the complementary sets of chaotic dynamics have a positive measure in parameter space that increases by increasing the parameter value .    our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "iii we explore the coarse functional form of the parameter - dependent diffusion coefficient and discuss it in relation to previous results on hyperbolic maps . in sec .",

    "in this section we explore the relationship between nonlinear maps like the climbing sine map and simple piecewise linear maps for which , in contrast to the climbing sine map , the diffusion coefficient can be calculated exactly .",
    "it is well - known that in special cases such different types of maps are linked to each other via the concept of conjugacy .",
    "indeed , we show that maps which are approximately conjugate to each other exhibit a very similar oscillatory behavior in the diffusion coefficient on coarse scales .",
    "our argument refers to some existing methods for calculating the diffusion coefficient of piecewise linear maps , which we briefly review .",
    "we then describe how we numerically calculated the complete parameter dependence of the diffusion coefficient for the climbing sine map and discuss a first result .",
    "one speaks of normal deterministic diffusion if the mean square displacement of an ensemble of moving particles grows linearly in time . the diffusion coefficient is then given by the einstein relation @xmath17 where the brackets denote an ensemble average over the moving particles .",
    "there exist various efficient numerical as well as , for some system parameters , analytical methods to exactly compute diffusion coefficients for piecewise linear hyperbolic maps , such as transition matrix methods based on markov partitions @xcite , cycle expansion methods@xcite , and more recently a very powerful method related to kneading sequences @xcite .",
    "we first restrict our analysis of diffusion in the climbing sine map to parameters for which there are simple markov partitions . for one - dimensional maps ,",
    "a partition is a markov partition if and only if parts of the partition get mapped again onto parts of the partition , or onto unions of parts of the partition , see ref .",
    "@xcite and further references therein .",
    "an example of a markov partition consisting of five parts is shown in the inset of fig.[d_mark ] . in case of the climbing sine map markov partitions",
    "can be constructed simply by forward iteration of one of the critical points @xmath18 defined by the condition that @xmath19 in the reduced map . if higher iterations of this point fall onto a periodic orbit a markov partition exits .",
    "indeed , if a markov partition is known , for piecewise linear maps the diffusion coefficient can often be calculated analytically via calculating the invariant measure of the map or via computing the second largest eigenvalue of the frobenius - perron operator written in form of a transition matrix .",
    "one can now identify an infinite series of parameter values corresponding to a certain type of markov partition @xcite .",
    "for parameter values which belong to such a markov partition series the corresponding invariant densities @xmath20 have a very similar functional form . note that , in case of nonlinear maps , singularities in the invariant density exactly correspond to the iteration of the critical point @xmath18 @xcite .",

    "thus , @xmath30 corresponds to the onset of diffusion for all three maps .",
    "for the two simple markov partition series @xmath31 and @xmath32 , corresponding to integer and half - integer values of @xmath27 , respectively , the diffusion coefficient of the zig - zag map can be calculated analytically . for integer values of @xmath27",
    "the result reads @xcite @xmath33 for half - integer values of @xmath27 the diffusion coefficient is easily calculated analytically , e.g. , by transition matrix methods @xcite , to @xmath34 in case of the climbing sine map and of the cubic map the diffusion coefficient was obtained from computer simulations by evaluating the mean square displacement eq .",

    "results are shown in fig .",
    "[ d_mark ] . for",
    "the climbing sine map some more markov partition series points ( alltogether five different series ) were included .",
    "for all three maps there is a very analogous oscillatory behavior of the parameter - dependent diffusion coefficient .",
    "these oscillations can be explained in terms of the changes of the microscopic dynamics under parameter variation , that is , whenever there is a local maximum there is an onset of strong backscattering in the dynamics yielding a local decrease of the diffusion coefficient in the parameter , and vice versa at local minima @xcite .",
    "however , the five markov partition series for the climbing sine diffusion coefficient already indicate that there are more irregularities on finer scales . for piecewise linear maps , the origin of these irregularities",
    "was identified to be the topological instability of the dynamics under parameter variation @xcite .",
    "that is , a small deviation of the parameter changes the markov partition and the corresponding invariant density which , in turn , is reflected in a change of the value of the diffusion coefficient .",
    "note that the dependence of the diffusion coefficient for a single markov partition series appears to be a monotonously increasing function of the parameter @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , computing @xmath35 for more and more markov partitions series will reveal more and more irregularities in @xmath35 thus forming a fractal structure @xcite .",
    "since the climbing sine map shares the same topological features as piecewise linear maps in terms of these series of markov partitions , one may wonder whether it is not possible to straightforwardly calculate the diffusion coefficient for nonlinear maps from the one of piecewise linear maps by using the concept of conjugacy @xcite , see also the definition in appendix a. in fact , it was stated by grossmann and thomae @xcite that the diffusion coefficient is invariant under conjugacy , however , without giving a proof . in appendix a such a proof is provided .",
    "unfortunately , conjugacies are explicitly known only in very specific cases and for maps acting on the unit interval @xcite .",
    "as soon as the map extrema exceed the unit interval , which is reminiscent of the onset of diffusive behavior , only some approximate , piecewise conjugacies could be constructed in a straightforward way , see ref .",
    "@xcite for an example .",
    "we now apply this reasoning along the lines of conjugacy in order to understand the similarities between the diffusion coefficient of the three maps as displayed in fig",
    ".  2 . the functional form of the cubic map can be obtained from a taylor series expansion of @xmath36 by keeping terms up to third order thus representing a low - order approximation of the climbing sine map .",
    "this seems to be reflected in the fact that at any odd integer parameter value of @xmath27 the climbing sine map has an invariant density whose functional form is very close to the one of the cubic map at parameter value @xmath30 , @xmath37 .",
    "hence , one may expect that both diffusion coefficients are possibly trivially related to each other , however , note the increasing deviations between the respective results at larger @xmath27 .    for @xmath30 , the cubic map and the piecewise linear zig - zag map are now in turn conjugate to each other @xcite .",
    "however , for @xmath38 we are not aware of the existence of any exact conjugacy between zig - zag and cubic map .",
    "still , along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite one can at least approximately relate both maps to each other via using piecewise conjugacies .",
    "this explains why the zig - zag map and the climbing sine map display qualitatively the very same oscillatory behavior in the diffusion coefficient , somewhat linked by diffusion in the cubic map .    in summary , by using markov partitions and by arguing with the concept of conjugacy we have shown that the structure of the diffusion coefficient for the nonlinear climbing sine map has much in common with the one of respective piecewise linear maps , in the sense of displaying a non - trivial oscillatory parameter dependence .",

    "in this paper we have performed a detailed analysis of the parameter dependence of the diffusion coefficient in a nonhyperbolic dynamical system .",
    "the climbing sine map has been chosen as a paradigmatic example of such a system .",
    "we have shown that , on a coarse scale , there are certain analogies between the parameter - dependent diffusion coefficient of this map and the ones in simple hyperbolic piecewise linear maps , such as the existence of an oscillatory structure , and the existence of asymptotic functional forms as derived from simple random walk models .",
    "however , in contrast to hyperbolic maps showing normal diffusion only , in the nonhyperbolic climbing sine map fractal structures appear for both normal and anomalous diffusive regions of the diffusion coefficient .",
    "an understanding of the origin of these fractal structures was given in terms of dynamical correlations starting from the green - kubo formula for diffusion .",
    "we furthermore related these irregularities in the diffusion coefficient more microscopically to different characteristics in corresponding fractal generalized takagi functions .",
    "for this purpose we derived a new functional recursion relation that defines these fractal forms and generalizes ordinary de rham - type equations .",
    "our analysis was completed by extensive numerical studies of the periodic windows of the climbing sine map showing that both the periodic and the chaotic parameter regions have positive measures in the parameter space",
    ". however , these measures are themselves parameter - dependent , and by increasing the parameter we found that the chaotic regions occupy larger and larger measures .",
    "we finally provided evidence that these different sets form fat fractals on the parameter axis .    in conclusion",
    ", we wish to remark that the climbing sine map is of the same functional form as the respective nonlinear equation in the two - dimensional standard map , which is considered to be a standard model for many physical hamiltonian dynamical systems .",
    "indeed , both models are motivated by the driven nonlinear pendulum , both are strongly nonhyperbolic , and though the standard map is area - preserving it too exhibits a highly irregular parameter - dependent diffusion coefficient .",
    "understanding the origin of these irregularities was the subject of intensive research @xcite , however , so far the complexity of this system did not enable to reveal its possibly fractal nature . a suitably adapted version of our approach to nonhyperbolic diffusive dynamics",
    "as presented in this paper may enable to make some progress in this direction .",
    "another interesting problem is to possibly further exploit the concept of conjugacy between nonlinear and piecewise linear maps , as explained in sec.iii , in order to exactly calculate diffusion coefficients for nonlinear maps .",
    "a very promising approach in this direction was presented in ref.@xcite .",
    "based on these techniques we are planning to perform a spectral analysis of the frobenius - perron operator governing the probability density of the diffusive climbing sine map . combining such an analysis with the takagi function approach outlined here may lead to a general theory of nonhyperbolic transport .",
    "it would furthermore be important to check out the applicability of periodic orbit theory for computing the parameter - dependent diffusion coefficient of the climbing sine map , which may provide an alternative method @xcite .",
    "another promising direction of future research concerns establishing crosslinks between our work and the realm of strange kinetics and stochastic modeling as described in refs.@xcite , e.g. , by trying to apply continuous time random walk techniques to more complicated chaotic models exhibiting fractal diffusion coefficients such as the climbing sine map .",
    "we finally emphasize the importance to look for possibly fractal transport coefficients in experiments .",
    "a very promising candidate appears to be the phase dynamics in squid s , which was very recently analyzed theoretically @xcite and studied experimentally @xcite .",
    "in this appendix we give a proof of the statement of grossmann and thomae @xcite that two diffusive maps which are conjugate to each other have the same diffusion coefficient .",
    "two diffusive maps @xmath139 and @xmath140 are called conjugate @xcite if there exists a map @xmath141 such that @xmath142 .",
    "let us assume in the following that the conjugation function @xmath143 is sufficiently smooth .",
    "let the invariant densities of the corresponding reduced ( @xmath144 ) maps be @xmath145 for @xmath146 and @xmath147 for @xmath148 ; then it is , according to conservation of probability , @xmath149 .",
