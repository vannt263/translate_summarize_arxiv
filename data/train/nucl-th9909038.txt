    "a good knowledge of the hyperon - nucleon ( yn ) interaction is crucial for the understanding of a variety of phenomena ranging from low energy hypernuclear physics to the strangeness production in high energy heavy ion collisions .",
    "however , due to the non - availability of sufficient yn scattering data , the yn interaction is still quite unknown .",
    "apart from a recent measurement of the differential cross sections for @xmath6 elastic scattering @xcite , only an almost three decades old total and differential cross section data on yn scattering from bubble chamber experiments @xcite exist . since the experiments with short - lived secondary beams of strange particles are difficult to perform , reactions like the @xmath7 and @xmath8 , involving the production of a yn pair in the final state , have received much attention @xcite .",
    "additionally , in the recent past , cross sections for the @xmath9 reaction have been measured @xcite at the saturne national laboratories for proton beam energies of 2.3 and 2.7 gev and at cosy for proton energies very near to the threshold @xcite .",
    "compared to the kaon and pion induced reactions , the @xmath9 reaction has the advantage that ( i ) the proton beams are easily available and ( ii ) the data are free from uncertainties due to the deuteron target as one can use a proton for the target nucleus .    over the past few years , several theoretical models using different approaches ( see ref.@xcite for a detailed review ) like the resonance model @xcite and meson exchange model of laget @xcite have tried to explain the total cross section data @xcite as well as the missing mass spectra of ref.@xcite on the @xmath9 reaction .",
    "the calculation of the missing mass spectra by deloff @xcite using two different models of yn forces included only the ` direct kaon emission ' ( dke ) diagram and achieved qualitative agreement with data .",
    "laget s calculation involved a ( @xmath10 + @xmath11 ) exchange mechanism in addition to dke . with the cut - off mass @xmath12 in the off - shell form factor for the exchanged kaon and the coupling constants @xmath13 and @xmath14 as free parameters , this model achieved good quantitative agreement with data .",
    "however , the above analyses either neglect the final - state interaction between the @xmath2 pair @xcite or use phenomenological prescriptions for the off - shell yn amplitudes .",
    "these approaches do not address the sensitivity of the cross sections to the specific description of the hyperon - nucleon potential @xmath15 . due to the large momentum transfer involved in the @xmath5 reaction",
    ", we believe that the cross sections for this reaction should be sensitive to the details of the @xmath2 potential . in a recent study of the weak strangeness producing reaction @xmath16 @xcite",
    "it was indeed found that apart from the weak transition potential the cross sections are very sensitive to the type of yn potential used . however , the cross sections for the weak reactions are very small ( @xmath17 mb ) .",
    "hence the @xmath5 reaction which is experimentally feasible is a better choice for the study of the @xmath2 interaction .",
    "currently there exist meson exchange models of @xmath18 which are similar in construction to the models of the well - known nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction .",
    "the prominent ones among these are the nijmegen and jlich potentials @xcite .",
    "the free model parameters of the yn interaction in these models are fixed using the cross section data @xcite on yn scattering .",
    "in addition to the meson exchange models , attempts to study the yn interaction using quark models have also been made @xcite .",
    "the @xmath18 in these models are constructed either using the resonating group method ( rgm ) or the quark cluster model approach . in the rgm @xcite , the total quark hamiltonian used consists of a confining piece , one gluon exchange potential and a chiral field induced quark - quark potential .",
    "the calculated yn phase shifts in this approach are found similar to those due to nijmegen model f. the cluster model approach focuses mainly on the yn interactions at short distances and explores their characteristics from the spin and flavour symmetry structure , using one - gluon - exchange and the confining potential for the quark hamiltonian . in our work",
    "we use the boson - exchange models .",
    "the aim of the present work is to study the sensitivity of the missing mass spectra in the @xmath5 reaction to @xmath18 , using as complete a description of the reaction as possible .",
    "we describe the @xmath2 wave function in the final state by using the solution of the lippmann - schwinger equation .",
    "the t - matrix for the @xmath19 scattering in this equation is constructed using the nijmegen soft - core @xcite and jlich @xcite potentials .",
    "this t - matrix includes the intermediate @xmath4 state and hence the @xmath2 wave function generated by us includes the effect of the @xmath20 channel on the @xmath2 scattering .    as for the reaction mechanism , guided by the earlier investigations of the @xmath5 reaction using @xmath10 and @xmath11 exchange models @xcite",
    ", we assume that it proceeds by the exchange of a pion or a kaon between the two protons in the entrance channel and neglect any contributions from heavier mesons like the @xmath21 and @xmath22 . in the case of @xmath10 exchange ,",
    "one of the interacting protons can be excited by the exchanged pion to any of the relevant @xmath23 resonances , which then decays to a @xmath24 and @xmath0 . in the case of kaon exchange ,",
    "the @xmath24 and @xmath0 are produced directly .",
    "in addition to these meson exchange diagrams , we also include the dke diagram , where the proton in the initial state dissociates into @xmath24 and an off - shell @xmath0 , which by its interaction with the second proton is brought on - shell .",
    "however its contribution is expected to be small because the intermediate @xmath0 is _ far _ off - shell .    in our work",
    "we have included all the production diagrams shown in fig .",
    "1 . since it is not possible to fix the relative sign between the amplitudes corresponding to the pion and kaon exchange diagrams we choose to retain an additive sign between these amplitudes .",
    "the diagrams arising due to antisymmetrization of the two protons in the initial state have also been included .",
    "the amplitudes for @xmath25 and @xmath26 at the kaon production vertices are constructed from the existing experimental data .",
    "since these amplitudes fit the experimental data , they implicitly include the excitation of the resonances in @xmath27 scattering .",
    "the off - shell extrapolation is incorporated through a form factor .    in section 2",
    "we describe the formalism used to evaluate the transition amplitude for the @xmath5 reaction . in section 3 we give the results .",
    "experimental data on the missing mass spectra of the exclusive @xmath5 reaction do not exist .",
    "hence we compare our results with the inclusive data of ref.@xcite on the @xmath9 reaction .",
    "upto the @xmath4 threshold these data correspond only to the missing mass spectra for the @xmath5 reaction . however , above the @xmath4 threshold , the contributions from the @xmath28 channels take over . the magnitude and shape of our calculated @xmath2 mass spectra for the @xmath5 reaction",
    "are found to be sensitive to the type of @xmath2 potential used . when compared with the inclusive data in the region below the @xmath4 threshold , they are in reasonable agreement with the data",
    ". however , the extent of agreement depends on the type of @xmath2 potential used . at the opening of the @xmath4 threshold , results with the jlich potentials show a pronounced peak which appears only as a small kink in the case of the nijmegen potential .",
    "for a more stringent constraint on the yn potentials , exclusive data on the various channels in the @xmath9 reaction are required .",
    "in addition to the study of the @xmath2 interaction we have also studied some other aspects of the @xmath5 reaction . instead of using the detailed description for the @xmath2 final state interaction as done in the present paper , it is always tempting to approximate it by an on - shell t - matrix multiplied by an off - shell extrapolating form factor , as done in ref .",
    "we have investigated the extent of accuracy of such a procedure by comparing the off - shell t - matrix computed by us with the corresponding on - shell t - matrix multiplied by an off - shell form factor . a detailed discussion of these results and those on the relative contributions of the various diagrams of fig .",

    "finally in section 4 we give a summary of this work .",

    "@xcite and considering the smallness of the coupling constant involved at the @xmath96 vertex as compared to that at the @xmath97 vertex , we do not expect a significant contribution from the above mentioned process .",
    "the main objective of our calculations is to study the effect of the final state interaction between the proton and @xmath0 in the @xmath98 reaction and make an inter comparison of the calculated cross sections using the different available models of the hyperon - nucleon ( yn ) interaction .",
    "the differences in the various models of the yn interaction are expected to show up in the @xmath0p invariant mass spectra because they involve @xmath0p at different relative momenta starting from zero at threshold .",

    "we observe that all the curves with the @xmath2 interaction included show an enhancement of the cross sections over the plane wave results , along the entire mass spectrum .",
    "the extent of the enhancement and the detailed structure in the spectrum , however , depend upon the choice of @xmath18 .",
    "we now discuss the structures appearing in the @xmath2 invariant mass spectra .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "2a , the jlich potential  produces a prominent cusp at the @xmath4 threshold which is less prominent in the case of the nijmegen potential .",
    "a rounded peak in the cross section at the @xmath4 threshold is produced by the jlich potential b. this peak is shifted in position as compared to the cusps .",

    "2a and 2b , depending on the type of potential used .",
    "the shapes of these structures at the @xmath0 and @xmath4 thresholds , as shown recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , are related to the location of the yn t - matrix poles in the various partial waves .",
    "the locations of these poles themselves , depend on the details of the yn potential used .",
    "all the above mentioned potentials differ in their weightage of the different partial waves , though they have been constructed by fitting to the same set of @xmath63 elastic scattering data .",
    "next , we discuss the individual contributions of the various partial waves to the cross sections . since the s waves are the most dominant in @xmath19 scattering , in fig .",
    "3 we show the cross sections obtained by omitting the interactions in the s wave channels and the coupling between the @xmath102 and @xmath103 channel .",
    "the calculations are done using all the diagrams of fig .",
    "1 and two types of hyperon - nucleon potentials , namely the nijmegen and the jlich  .",
    "the thin solid line is the plane wave calculation in which the final state interaction of the @xmath0 and proton is switched off completely .",
    "as can be seen in the figure , in the case of the nijmegen @xmath2 potential , removal of the interaction in the @xmath104 channel brings down the cross sections ( see dashed line ) almost to the plane wave results .",
    "omitting the @xmath99 and @xmath105 transitions in @xmath19 scattering ( dash - dotted line ) has a small effect and the removal of the @xmath106 channel causes a negligible change in the cross sections and can not be seen in the figure .",
    "the jlich potential however has its strength distributed more evenly over the various channels .",
    "the @xmath106 transition specifically in this potential seems to be responsible for the peak at the @xmath0 threshold .",
    "let us now see how the calculated cross sections using the various @xmath2 potentials compare with the available data . in fig .",
    "4 we compare our calculated cross sections with the inclusive data of ref.@xcite on the @xmath9 reaction , since there is no exclusive data available on the missing mass spectra in the @xmath5 reaction .",
    "below the threshold for the @xmath4 production ( w = 2128 mev ) the data correspond entirely to that for the @xmath5 reaction .",
    "the steep rise in the measured cross sections at the @xmath4 threshold is due to the opening of the @xmath4 producing channels @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "we see that , while both the nijmegen and jlich potentials give the general trend of the data below the @xmath4 threshold , in details they compare differently .",
    "the cross sections calculated using jlich  agree somewhat with data at the @xmath0 threshold .",
    "the peak at the @xmath4 threshold is more pronounced with the jlich potentials than with the nijmegen potential . to constrain the yn potentials further ,",
    "we need exclusive data on the @xmath2 and @xmath20 channels .",
    "next , we investigate the accuracy of the on - shell approximation to the @xmath2 final state interaction . for this",
    "we use the nijmegen yn potential . in fig . 5",
    ", the thick solid line is our calculation with the off - shell @xmath2 t - matrix as in fig .",
    "the thin solid line is obtained by replacing the off - shell matrix elements @xmath109 in our calculations by the on - shell ones @xmath110 as in ref.@xcite with @xmath111 are shown by the dashed curve of fig .",
    "2 . the form factor causes a large reduction of the cross sections and the pronounced peak at the @xmath0 threshold flattens out . still a considerable difference between this prescription and the correct calculation persists .",
    "this difference can now be reduced and the calculated `` on - shell '' results can be brought nearer to the experimental measurement , by arbitrarily adjusting the parameters in the reaction vertices for the @xmath5 transition . the dash - dotted curve in fig .",
    "2 which agrees with data is the result for @xmath93 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 equal to 1.1 gev , 0.925 gev and -13.26 respectively .",
    "however , this way of constraining the transition amplitude parameters is obviously misleading .",
    "so far we have discussed the results using the reaction mechanism involving all the diagrams of fig .",
    "1 . let us now see the contributions of the individual diagrams with the pion and kaon exchange and direct @xmath24 emission . in fig .",
    "6 we plot the cross sections with only pion exchange ( dashed curves ) , only kaon exchange ( dash - dotted curves ) and the full calculation with @xmath10 plus @xmath11 exchange and @xmath24 direct emission ( solid curves ) for the nijmegen and jlich  @xmath2 interactions .",
    "the contribution of the direct @xmath24 emission diagram is found to be negligibly small .",
    "the contribution of the kaon exchange diagram is much larger than that of the pion exchange diagram but it does not account completely for the cross sections .",
    "the dominance of the kaon - exchange diagram found here is consistent with some recent results reported by the disto collaboration @xcite .",
    "they performed a measurement of the polarization transfer coefficient @xmath114 for the @xmath115 reaction and found it to be very large and negative which is consistent with a mechanism dominated by kaon - exchange . in the next section",
    "we summarize the findings of this work .",
    "we have studied the hyperon - nucleon ( yn ) final state interactions ( fsi ) in the @xmath5 reaction at 2.3 gev beam energy .",
    "the invariant @xmath2 mass spectra are calculated within a meson exchange framework .",
    "the fsi between the @xmath0 and the proton are incorporated through a t - matrix for @xmath116 scattering .",
    "this t - matrix is constructed using the nijmegen and jlich yn potentials . due to unavailability of data on the invariant mass spectra in the exclusive @xmath117 p reaction",
    "we compare our results with data on the inclusive @xmath118 reaction .",
    "upto the @xmath4 threshold the inclusive data receives contribution only from the exclusive @xmath5 channel .",
    "the cross sections with fsi included are found to be enhanced compared to the plane wave results for both the potentials .",
    "however , the magnitude of the cross sections and the structure in them differ a lot for the two potentials .",
    "the general trend of the experimental data is produced by these calculations but in details they compare differently with data .",
    "thus the exclusive data on the @xmath5 reaction can be very useful to differentiate amongst different @xmath18 .    regarding the reaction mechanism involved , we find that the kaon exchange diagram gives the dominant contribution to the cross sections .",
    "this is consistent with some recent measurements of @xmath114 for the @xmath119 reaction made by the disto collaboration .",
    "we have made a comparison of our results with the off - shell t - matrix for @xmath19 scattering with those using the on - shell t - matrix .",
    "the on - shell results ( even after multiplying by the off - shell form factor ) overestimate the results obtained using the off - shell @xmath2 t - matrix .",
    "therefore , attempts to represent the fsi between the @xmath0 and proton by phase shifts ( with an off shell form factor ) may not represent the fsi accurately . this can lead to errors in conclusions about the parameters associated with the @xmath5 transition interaction , if the same are adjusted to fit the data in this approach .    the present work can be improved by taking into account the actual off - shell nature of the @xmath120 and @xmath121 t - matrices .",
    "the final state @xmath122 interaction may not be as small as that expected for the @xmath123 pair .",
    "it is incorporated in some sense in the pion exchange terms of the cross sections in this work since we use @xmath124 constructed from experimental data .",
