    "an outstanding puzzle in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics is the pattern of fermion masses and mixings .",
    "the fermion masses cover a range of at least 12 orders of magnitude .",
    "the neutrino mass is bounded by @xmath14 ev ( planck - i ) or @xmath15 ev ( planck - ii )  @xcite , which is to be compared to the top quark mass @xmath16 gev  @xcite .",
    "the mass ratio between the heaviest and the lightest quark ( the top and the up quark ) is @xmath17 , the mass ratio between the heaviest and the lightest charged lepton ( the tau and the electron ) is @xmath18 , and the mass ratio between neutrinos seems to be @xmath19 .",
    "fermion mixing angles follow a different pattern for quarks and leptons : one large and two small mixing angles for the quarks ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) and a large cp - violating phase ( @xmath23 ) ; two large and one small mixing angle for the leptons ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) and no experimental information yet on the leptonic cp - violating phases .",
    "it is believed that an understanding of the observed pattern of fermion masses and mixings may provide a crucial clue to physics beyond the sm .",
    "the two large lepton mixing angles may be telling us about new symmetries not present in the quark sector and may provide a clue to the nature of the quark - lepton physics beyond the sm .",
    "actually , in the absence of flavor symmetries , particle masses and mixings are generally undetermined in a gauge theory . with a single higgs in the sm",
    "one can not explain the strong hierarchies in the quark and lepton masses .",
    "of course , one can imagine that the fermion masses and mixings are independent parameters in the sm .",
    "however , one can not calculate them from a fundamental theory .",
    "it is natural to suppose that the extreme smallness of the neutrino masses in comparison to the charged fermion masses is related to the existence of a new fundamental scale , and thus to new physics beyond the sm .",
    "large ratios between the masses of fermions of successive generations may be due to suppressions by different powers of the new scale , and there could be a hierarchy in which the masses of the lighter fermions are suppressed by powers of a large new scale ( e.g. , the seesaw mechanism of  @xcite or the froggatt - nielsen mechanism of  @xcite ) .",
    "a new large scale may also be used to explain why the hierarchy of neutrino masses is milder than the hierarchies of quarks and charged leptons .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a specific flavor symmetry and mass suppression pattern that constrain the flavor structure of the fermion yukawa couplings and leads to predictions for the fermion masses and mixings .",
    "the large fermion mixing angles can be understood by introducing a non - abelian discrete flavor symmetry group , and the small fermion mixing angles can arise from a mismatch between the residual symmetry of the flavor group after the discrete flavor symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "the mass hierarchies of the fermion sector can be understood by introducing an anomalous @xmath27 global symmetry , in which gauge singlet flavon fields @xmath28 couple to dimension-3 or -4 fermion operators with different powers of @xmath28 .",
    "schematically , the electroweak - scale fermion lagrangian depends on the flavon fields as @xmath29 where the @xmath30 and the @xmath31 are dimension-3 and dimension-4 fermion operators , and the coefficients @xmath32 and @xmath33 are of order 1 . here",
    "@xmath34 is the scale of flavor dynamics , and the mass scale of the froggart - nielsen heavy fields that are integrated out .",
    "since the yukawa couplings are eventually responsible for the fermion masses they must be related in a very simple way at a large scale in order for intermediate scale physics to produce all the interesting structure in the fermion mass matrices .",
    "we propose a realistic model for quarks and leptons based on an @xmath35 flavor symmetry   symmetries  @xcite in that the dirac neutrino yukawa coupling constants do not all have the same magnitude .",
    "] in the seesaw framework . the seesaw mechanism , besides explaining of smallness of the measured neutrino masses , has the additional appealing feature of being able to generate the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe through leptogenesis  @xcite . in such a framework",
    "the yukawa couplings are functions of flavon fields which are responsible for making right - handed neutrinos very heavy .",
    "the main theoretical goal of our work is twofold .",
    "first , we are going to explain the large and small mixing angles in the lepton and quark sectors , and the enormously various hierarchies spanned by the fermion masses , in terms of successive powers of the flavon field , describing also why the hierarchy of light neutrino masses is relatively mild , while the hierarchy of the charged fermions is strong .",
    "second , we investigate cp violation and neutrinoless double beta ( @xmath0 ) decay in the lepton sector and show how cp phases and/or @xmath0-decay can be predicted and/or constrained by the model and/or the present experimental data . moreover , in our model , since the dirac neutrino yukawa couplings are of order 1 , a successful explanation of the baryon asymmetry of the universe through leptogenesis may be possible if the leptogenesis scale is @xmath36 gev , which is below the grand unification scale of @xmath37 gev .",
    "implementing such leptogenesis can provide information or constraints on the dirac cp - violating phase and @xmath0-decay .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section , first we lay down the particle content and the field representations under the @xmath38 flavor symmetry , then we construct higgs and yukawa lagrangians , and finally add a flavor symmetry @xmath27 to build an effective model . in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss how the hierarchies of masses and mixings in the quark and lepton sectors can be realized after spontaneous symmetry breaking of the @xmath38 flavor symmetry . in sec .",
    "iv , we consider leptonic cp violation , @xmath0-decay and leptogenesis , and we perform a numerical analysis of our model using neutrino oscillation data .",
    "we give our conclusions in sec .",
    "in order to understand the small lepton mixing angle @xmath39 and the two large lepton mixing angles ( @xmath40 ) as well as the cabibbo quark mixing angle @xmath41 and the two small quark mixing angles , we propose a model based on an @xmath42 flavor symmetry for leptons and quarks , which is an extension of that in ref .",
    "in addition , in order to describe the strong hierarchy of charged fermion masses and the mild hierarchy of neutrino masses , we use the mechanism in eq .",
    "( [ flavon ] ) , imposing a continuous global @xmath27 symmetry under which the fermions are distinguished .",

    "thus the potential @xmath303 is invariant under permutations of @xmath304 , @xmath305 , and @xmath306 when @xmath44 is real .",
