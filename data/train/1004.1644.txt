    "in the standard theory of hierarchical structure formation , cold dark matter particles gather to form small halos , which later merge to form ever more massive halos . as a result of this process , dark matter halos ( such that that hosting the milky way ) are expected to contain many subhalos , ranging from dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( @xmath0 ) down to objects with masses as small as @xmath1 .",
    "the minimum mass of dark matter subhalos is determined by the temperature at which the dark matter particles became kinetically decoupled from the cosmic neutrino background , which in turn depends on the particle physics of the dark matter candidate .    with the exception of dwarf",
    "spheroidal galaxies , efforts to directly observe dark matter subhalos have failed to detect any such objects .",
    "a promising method to search for nearby dark matter substructures is to use gamma ray telescopes , such as the fermi gamma ray space telescope ( fgst ) , to detect the products of dark matter annihilations .",
    "to such a telescope , relatively large ( @xmath2 ) and nearby ( @xmath3 kpc ) subhalos could appear as as bright and point - like gamma ray sources , without counterparts in other wavelengths . for reasonable assumptions ( based on the results of numerical simulations ) regarding the number of subhalos in the milky way and the dark matter distribution within those subhalos ,",
    "one is led to expect a handful of subhalos to be observable by the fgst .",
    "for example , a dark matter candidate in the form of a 50 gev particle with a annihilation cross section of @xmath4 @xmath5/s is predicted to provide on the order of a few subhalos that would be observable at or above the @xmath6 level  @xcite .",
    "the fgst collaboration has recently published a catalog of 1451 point sources  @xcite , including 630 that are not associated with sources in other astronomical catalogs . of these unidentified sources , 368",
    "have been detected with greater than 5@xmath7 significance , and are more than 10 degrees away from the galactic plane . in this article , we study this collection of gamma ray sources and consider whether any significant fraction might be the result of dark matter annihilations taking place in nearby subhalos .",

    "[ catalog ] , we determine which of the objects contained within the fgst s first source catalog can be fit by dark matter annihilations , for various combinations of mass and annihilation channel .",

    "[ hints ] , we discuss some of the more interesting features of the first source catalog , and consider whether they might result from a population of relatively large and nearby subhalos .",
    "we summarize our results in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "following the results of numerical simulations , we begin by assuming that the galactic halo contains dark matter subhalos with a mass function given by @xmath8 , down to some minimum mass , normalized such that 10% of the total mass of the halo is found in @xmath9-@xmath10 subhalos  @xcite . for a minimum subhalo mass of one earth mass",
    ", this normalization corresponds to a total of @xmath11 subhalos within the milky way , which collectively make up about half of our galaxy s total mass . in the local neighborhood , this implies a number density of approximately 34 ( roughly earth mass ) subhalos per cubic parsec .",
    "the precise value for the mimimum subhalo mass depends on the characteristics of the dark matter particle  @xcite . as this study relies primarily on the properties of the largest mass subhalos , the minimum mass adopted has no significant impact on our results .",
    "we further assume that the subhalos are described by the following density profile , as supported by the via lactea simulation  @xcite : @xmath12 ^ 2 } , \\label{1pt2}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the scale radius of the subhalo .",
    "one should note , however , that the halo profiles describing the inner volumes of dark matter subhalos are difficult to resolve using present simulations , and groups other than via lactea collaboration ( notably , the aquarius project ) have reported somewhat less steep inner profiles  @xcite . with this in mind",
    ", we will also calculate results using an einasto _ et al .",

    "the concentration of a halo is defined as the ratio of its virial radius to its scale radius . to estimate the concentration of a halo of a given mass , we use the analytic model of bullock _",
    "et al . _",
    "this model estimates a concentration of 21 ( 27 ) for a subhalo of mass @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) . for large halo masses , the results of numerical simulations are in good agreement with this model .",
    "smaller subhalos , currently beyond the resolution of such simulations , are largely irrelevant to our study .",
    "there are also indications from numerical simulations that subhalo in the inner volumes of their host halo tend to have , on average , higher concentrations  @xcite . to be conservative we do not include this effect in our calculations",
    ".    one should keep in mind that considerable halo - to - halo variation in the concentration and shape of subhalo profiles has been observed in numerical simulations .",
    "the model of bullock _",
    ", for example , only provides a measure of the average concentration of a subhalo of a given mass .",
    "the probability of a halo having a given concentration can be modelled by a lognormal distribution , with a dispersion of @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "although we adopt mean concentration values in our calculations , we estimate that halo - to - halo fluctuations will increase the number of observable subhalos by a factor of about two in most cases ( see also ref .",
    "note that , throughout this study , references to subhalo masses denote the mass prior to loss through tidal stripping .",
    "subhalos in the local volume of the milky way are likely to have had a large fraction of their mass stripped through tidal interactions with other halos and stars .",
    "this primarily impacts a subhalo s outer density profile , leaving its denser , more tightly bound inner cusp intact  @xcite . as the default assumption throughout our calculations",
    ", we assume that nearby subhalos have lost the outermost 99% of their total mass ( although this only modestly impacts the overall annihilation rate ) .    just as the halo of the milky way contains many subhalos , subhalos themselves",
    "are also expected to contain smaller bound dark matter structures within their volumes .",
    "this can lead to an overall `` boost factor '' to the dark matter annihilation rate from such objects . to be conservative",
    ", we do not include any such boost in our ( default ) calculations .",
    "the rate of gamma rays produced from dark matter annihilations taking place in a nearby subhalo is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the annihilation cross section and mass of the dark matter particle , respectively , and the second integral is performed over the volume of the subhalo .",
    "@xmath22 is the spectrum of gamma rays produced per dark matter annihilation , which depends on the dominant annihilation channel(s ) and on the mass of the dark matter particle ( we use pythia  @xcite as implemented in darksusy @xcite to calculate the gamma ray spectrum ) . in the left frame of fig .",
    "[ window ] , we show the gamma ray luminosity from a subhalo , as a function of the subhalo s mass .",
    "results are shown for 99% , 90% and 0% mass loss .    in order for the gamma ray annihilation products from a subhalo to constitute a source that could potentially appear in the fgst point source catalog , the subhalo must be both sufficiently bright and sufficiently compact to mimic a point source . to estimate the number of events from a subhalo observed by fgst , we multiply the gamma ray flux by an effective area of 6800 @xmath23 , and a coverage of 20% of the sky at any given time .",
    "although the detectability of a given gamma ray source depends somewhat on its spectral shape and its location in the sky , we can roughly estimate how bright a given subhalo must be to be detectable at high significance by fgst .",
    "in particular , the diffuse gamma ray flux measured by fgst generates approximately 20 events per year per square degree above 1 gev over galactic latitudes of @xmath24 , and about 60 - 70 events per year per square degree above 1 gev over galactic latitudes of @xmath25 . in these two regions of sky",
    ", we estimate that @xmath26 or @xmath27 signal events per year above 1 gev would be required in order for a subhalo to be potentially discovered with 5@xmath7 significance . based on this estimate",
    ", we conservatively classify any subhalo that produces more than 50 events above 1 gev per year at fgst to be potentially detectable . in the right frame of fig .",

    "although the smallest subhalos ( sometimes called `` microhalos '' ) are much more numerous , individual sub - solar mass halos are unlikely to provide observable fluxes gamma rays ( also see , for example , ref .",
    "we find that most of the subhalos potentially detectable by fgst have relatively large masses , @xmath28 .    to appear as a point source to the fgst , the angular extent of the halo must not be much larger than the telescope s point spread function . to be considered point - like",
    ", we require that 95% of the photons from a subhalo come from within a 2@xmath29 radius ( approximately the 95% containment angle for 1 gev photons at fgst ) . in fig .",

    ", we estimate that fgst is expected to detect 50 or more photons with energy @xmath321 gev from only a few point - like subhalos in a year of observation .",
    "this result , however , depends strongly on the mass , annihilation cross section , and annihilation channels of the dark matter particle .",

    "@xcite ) , for example , we expect fgst to detect approximately 16 subhalos , most of which with masses between @xmath34 and @xmath9 solar masses , prior to mass losses ( we consider only halos up to @xmath9 solar masses in our calculations ) . in fig .",

    "the details of the subhalo profiles , concentrations , and the overall fraction of dark matter mass contained in subhalos can each significantly impact the number of subhalos that are observable by fgst . in table",
    "[ table ] , we give the number of point - like subhalos observable by fgst for a variety of possible astrophysical assumptions , each for the case of a 50 gev dark matter particle that annihilates to @xmath30 with @xmath33 @xmath5/s . by varying the inner slope of the subhalos density profile and the fraction of mass that is lost from the original subhalo ( ml ) , we find that the number of observable subhalos can vary by a factor of several in either direction from the results shown in fig .  [ number ] .",
    "if we consider the effects of substructure within subhalos themselves , we find that extrapolating the bullock _",

    "in this section , we turn our attention to the fgst first source catalog  @xcite , which identifies point sources with greater than @xmath40 significance within the data collected between august 2008 and july 2009 , over the 100  mev to 100 gev energy range . within the context of dark matter subhalos , we are interested in sources that are non - variable and are not associated with known astrophysical objects .",
    "furthermore , we only consider point sources that are more than @xmath41 away from the galactic plane ( that is , @xmath42 ) , as it is expected that the region close to the plane will contain the majority of baryonic gamma ray sources ( pulsars , supernova remnants , x - ray binaries , etc . ) .",

    "a class of astrophysical gamma ray sources with a very hard spectrum , however , could also fit the observed spectra of these sources .",

    "in this section , we use the results shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : goodfit ] to determine the maximum number of dark matter subhalos that could plausibly be present within the fermi first source catalog , and use that information to calculate an upper limit on the dark matter s annihilation cross section .        to begin",
    ", we used a monte carlo to estimate what a signal from dark matter would potentially look like within the histograms of fig .",
    "[ fig : goodfit ] . in fig .",
    "[ mc ] we show , for the case of a 180 gev dark matter particle that annihilates to @xmath57 , the fraction of subhalos that are predicted to be fit well by an annihilating dark matter hypothesis , as a function of the dark matter s mass .",
    "here we have considered point - like subhalos that produce 50 events above 1 gev .",
    "as expected , the fraction with a good fit peaks at @xmath58 gev , but with considerable width to the distribution . in the left frame , backgrounds were neglected , while in the right frame we adopted a diffuse gamma ray background of the form @xmath59 below 2 gev , and @xmath60 above 2 gev , normalized such that it produces 40 events above 1 gev per subhalo .",
    "the inclusion of this background broadens the range of masses that can fit the simulated data significantly .",
    "at high galactic latitudes ( @xmath61 ) , where the galactic diffuse emission is lowest ( @xmath3920 events per year per square degree above 1 gev ) , this distribution resembles that shown in the left frame . over most of the sky ( @xmath62 ) , however , it will more closely resemble that shown in the right frame . for sources closer to the galactic plane",
    ", the distribution can be even broader .",
    "note that brighter subhalos will also provide a distribution that is more strongly peaked at the dark matter s mass , although we expect most of the observable subhalos to be not much brighter than the threshold for their detection .        using these distributions",
    ", we then proceeded to calculate how many subhalos could possibly be contained within the histograms shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : goodfit ] . at a minimum",
    ", we could simply conclude that there there are no more subhalos in the sample than provide good fits .",
    "for example , if we consider a 400 gev dark matter particle annihilating to @xmath57 , we see from fig .  [",
    "fig : goodfit ] that about 72 ( 130 ) subhalo candidate sources in the fermi first source catalog that provide a fit better than @xmath52dof @xmath63 ( 1.2 ) . from this",
    ", we can robustly conclude that fewer than approximately 145 subhalos are present in the catalog .    however , if we also consider the shapes of the distributions in fig .",
    "[ fig : goodfit ] , we can in some cases more stringently constrain the number of subhalos contained in the catalog . in particular , if a very large number of subhalos were actually present within one of the histograms shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : goodfit ] , then subtracting that population from the distribution observed would leave a histogram with a deep , depression - like feature . while it is possible that the dark matter signal distribution ( such as that shown in fig .",
    "[ mc ] ) is exactly balanced by a depression in the distribution from astrophysical sources alone , we consider this unlikley and fine tuned .    in fig .",
    "[ 400 ] , we demonstrate how we can use this approach to more stringently constrain the number of subhalos in the fermi first source catalog . here , we plot the histogram for the @xmath50 channel , subtracting from it a population of 0 , 25 , or 50 subhalos ( consisting of dark matter particles with @xmath64 gev ) . by requiring that the subtraction of a subhalo population does not lead to a statistically significant depression - like feature in the histograms",
    ", we can often place a more stringent limit the number of subhalos present in the fermi first source catalog . in the case of a 400 gev dark matter particle ,",
    "annihilating to @xmath57 , for example , we conclude that less than approximately 35 subhalos are present in the catalog .",
    "we have repeated this procedure for each dark matter mass and annihilation channel and determined in each case the maximum number of dark matter subhalos possibly contained within the fermi first source catalog . from the maximum number of subhalos",
    ", we then calculated an upper limit on the dark matter s annihilation cross section . in fig .",
    "[ limit ] , we show the upper limit on the annihilation cross section as a function of mass , and for various annihilation channels . here",
    "we have used our default assumptions as discussed in sec .",
    "[ theory ] ( @xmath65 , 99% mass loss , no sub - subhalos ) , and assumed that the fermi first source catalog is approximately complete for sources that produce more than @xmath3950 events per year above 1 gev .",
    "although effects such as confusion between multiple point sources are expected to cause some sources to not appear in the fgst point source catalog , this is thought to impact less than 10% of sources with @xmath66  @xcite .    of course , if we adopt different assumptions pertaining to the dark matter subhalo profiles , concentrations , and mass losses , we can arrive at somewhat different conclusions . erring on the optimistic side , if we use our default profile shape , but with only 90% mass loss , and include the effects of halo - to - halo variations in subhalo concentrations , our predicted number of observable subhalos increases by a factor of @xmath3956 , corresponding to a limit on the annihilation cross section that is more stringent by a factor of approximately 3 ( or even more stringent if subhalos have their own substructure ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if we conservatively adopt a less cusped profile shape ( @xmath67 ) , 99% mass loss , and neglect halo - to - halo variations , we arrive at a limit that is about 4 times less stringent than that shown in fig .",
    "[ limit ] .",
    "comparing these results to other constraints that have been placed on the dark matter annihilation cross section , we find that our constraint is comparable to , or in some cases more stringent than , those found previously . in particular , the fgst collaboration has published constraints from observations of 14 dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( draco and ursa minor providing the most stringent constraints )  @xcite . for a 30 gev dark matter particle annihilating to @xmath30 , for example , that study concludes that @xmath68 @xmath5/s , which is comparable to our result shown in fig .",

    "in this section , we turn our attention to some of the features observed in the histograms of fig .

    "for the case of a 500 gev dark matter particle annihilating to @xmath71 , we find that the observed bump can be removed , flattening the overall distribution , if a population of approximately 30 subhalos is present within the catalog",
    ". a similar number of subhalos with @xmath58 gev , annihilating to either @xmath57 or @xmath30 , would also also largely removed the features seen in their respective channels .    in the @xmath73 gev , @xmath71 case ,",

    "the factor of @xmath393 disparity between these two values could easily be accounted for if , for example , subhalos contain significant substructure , or less mass loss has taken place than we had assumed ( see table  [ table ] ) .    in the case of @xmath58 gev , and annihilations to @xmath57 , we find again that a population of approximately 30 subhalos within the fermi first source catalog can flatten the observed distribution .",
    "this corresponds to an annihilation cross section of @xmath76 @xmath5/s .",
    "this is comparable to the value predicted for a wino - like neutralino , such as is found in models of anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "a similar cross section would also be found for the case of annihilations to @xmath30 .",
    "we do not consider the democratic lepton case further as this appears to conflict with the cosmic ray electron spectrum as measured by fgst  @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that none these features can , at this time , be used to confidently support a claim that a population of dark matter subhalos is present within the fermi first source catalog .",
    "it is the case , however , that the presence of such a population could explain some of the features observed in the catalog .",
    "if either of these observed features does , in fact , result from the presence of a subhalo population , the feature is be expected to become more prominent as the fgst accumulates more data , and the subhalos spectra become more precisely measured .",
    "in this article , we have studied the recently published fermi gamma ray space telescope s first source catalog , and considered whether a significant number of the sources in this catalog might be dark matter subhalos . for a typical thermal dark matter candidate with a mass of 50 gev , and reasonable astrophysical assumptions ,",
    "one predicts that a few relatively large ( @xmath2 ) and nearby ( @xmath3 kpc ) subhalos would be bright enough to appear within such a catalog .",
    "it is unlikely , however , that such a small number of sources could be identified from among the hundreds of unidentified sources in the fermi first source catalog .",

    "<S> the milky way s dark matter halo is thought to contain large numbers of smaller subhalos . </S>",
    "<S> these objects can contain very high densities of dark matter , and produce potentially observable fluxes of gamma rays . in this article , we study the gamma ray sources in the fermi gamma ray space telescope s recently published first source catalog , and attempt to determine whether this catalog might contain a population of dark matter subhalos . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , while approximately 20 - 60 of the catalog s unidentified sources could plausibly be dark matter subhalos , such a population can not be clearly identified as such at this time . from the properties of the sources in the first source catalog , we derive limits on the dark matter s annihilation cross section that are comparably stringent to those derived from recent observations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies . </S>"
