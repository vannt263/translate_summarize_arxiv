    "the rare decay  is a flavor changing neutral current , mediated in the standard model by heavy quark loop diagrams , and in particular , is sensitive to the ckm matrix element @xmath1 .",
    "the theoretical prediction for this branching ratio is very clean : the hadronic matrix element can be determined from the  branching ratio via an isospin transformation , the long distance contributions are negligible , and the qcd corrections have been calculated to next to leading log ; bringing the theoretical uncertainty to 7%@xcite .    the standard model prediction for the branching ratio is @xmath3 .",
    "due to the current uncertainty in  , @xmath4 , and  a value for the branching ratio outside of the range 0.63.0@xmath5 would be unexpected . over the next few years",
    "the e787 experiment at the ags is expected to reach a single event sensitivity of a few@xmath6 and should therefore observe  .",
    "the early version of the detector is described elsewhere@xcite , but a schematic of the upgraded version shows essentially the same functionality ( see fig.[det ] ) .",
    "an 800 mev / c k@xmath7 beam , incident from the left , is stopped in a scintillating fiber target in the center of the 10 kg solenoidal magnet field .",
    "the experimental signature for  is a single charged kaon track incident and a single charged pion track outgoing , with two missing neutrinos .",
    "given the weak constraints and the small branching ratio , the particle identification and kinematics of the @xmath8 must be very well measured and any additional particles must be vetoed with high efficiency .",
    "this is most readily solved in the center of mass frame ; therefore , e787 runs in a stopped kaon beam at the ags .",
    "the two dominant decay modes , k@xmath9 and k@xmath10 , produce mono - energetic charged particles which can be kinematically separated from  .",
    "the e787 detector uses redundant measures of the kinematics : momentum , energy and range .",
    "the k@xmath9 can also be suppressed by vetoing on the @xmath11 photons , so the detector is surrounded by a nearly 4@xmath8 photon veto ( pv ) and in fact almost the entire detector not traversed by the @xmath12 is used as a veto .",
    "the k@xmath10 can be suppressed by requiring that the @xmath8 decay to a @xmath13 in the range stack ( rs ) .",
    "the entire  decay chain is observed with 500 mhz , 8-bit transient digitizers ( td ) sampling the output of the rs scintillators .",
    "the next significant background comes from scattered beam pions .",
    "the primary tools for rejecting these events are fast , finely segmented beam counters and good tracking in the fiber target .      a significant  data set was collected with the original detector during the period from 19891991 .",
    "the analysis of the this data is described in detail elsewhere.@xcite a total of 3.49@xmath14 kaons were stopped ( kb@xmath15 ) .",
    "a final plot of the range and kinetic energy of events remaining after all cuts is shown in fig.[pnn_fig ] .",
    "no events were seen , implying a 90% cl limit on the branching ratio of : @xmath16 @xmath17      a sample of @xmath18  candidates was collected during the 198991 running period ( kb@xmath19).@xcite the  trigger required two charged tracks to reach the range stack , but not to penetrate very deeply , and required that there be no activity in the pv .",
    "a total of @xmath18 triggers was collected during 198991 .",
    "two separate techniques of analyzing the data were employed .",
    "one analysis required that all three tracks be reconstructed in the drift chamber .",
    "a second analysis , with larger acceptance , did not require that the 3@xmath20 be fully reconstructed .",
    "if the 3@xmath20 track remains in the target no momentum information is available , but the total kinetic energy ( q ) is .",
    "figure  [ pmm_fig ] shows the final samples .",
    "the left figure shows the events that survive all cuts of the first analysis as a scatter plot of the reconstructed kaon mass vs. the square of the transverse momentum .",
    "a total of 13 events were seen in the small signal box , at low p@xmath21 and m@xmath22 . the larger box ( excluding the smaller one )",
    "is used for a background estimation .",
    "it is dominated by k@xmath23 that have passed the 90% confidence level electron rejection cut .",
    "the background estimate is @xmath24 events in the signal box .",
    "the plot on the right shows the kinetic energy of the final sample of events from the second analysis . in this case",
    "we see a clear peak at the value of q = 143 mev from the  decay , as well as a smaller peak at q = 75 from the k@xmath25 decay .",
    "a fit to the signal plus background yields @xmath26 signal events .",
    "a total of @xmath27  triggers were collected ( kb@xmath28 ) during the 1991 run.@xcite the trigger selected @xmath12 with short range and di - photons with an opening angle @xmath29 and an invariant mass between 190600 mev / c@xmath30 .",
    "the major backgrounds are from two classes .",
    "the first is k@xmath25 and k@xmath31 with overlapping photons .",
    "these are rejected by cuts targeting the @xmath32 and @xmath33 consistency of the photon clusters .",
    "the second class includes k@xmath34 , k@xmath9 , k@xmath25 and k@xmath31 ; these are all kinematically distinct from  .",
    "the k@xmath34 s are missing a neutrino and the @xmath13 must be misidentified as a @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath8 in k@xmath9 must scatter in the target and be down - shifted in momentum .",
    "the k@xmath25 and k@xmath31 are missing a photon and do not conserve momentum .",
    "after all cuts targeting these backgrounds are applied , 31 events survive . after a background subtraction ,",
    "the signal is @xmath35 events .",
    "a plot of @xmath36 of the remaining events is shown in fig.[pgg_fig ] the distribution is significantly different than phase space and is consistent with chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath37pt ) .",
    "a second sample of  with a long range pion and a low m@xmath38 found no events and set a limit of br (  , @xmath39 mev / c ) @xmath40 , assuming a phase space distribution . a small branching ratio for @xmath39 mev / c is consistent with @xmath37pt .",
    "following the 1991 run a number of upgrades to the e787 experiment were undertaken . with the increased proton intensity available from the ags with the booster , the beam line and essentially every detector system were upgraded to handle higher rates and to maintain and improve the background rejection .",
    "a drawing of the upgraded e787 detector is shown in fig.[det ]      the first of these was the construction of a new low energy separated k@xmath7 beam - line ( lesb3).@xcite the central drift chamber was replaced with a new ultra - thin chamber ( utc ) . the momentum resolution for k@xmath9 and k@xmath10 of 1.2% and the @xmath33 resolution of 1 mm",
    "are both improved by @xmath41 2 compared to the previous drift chamber.@xcite the pb - scintillator endcaps ( ec ) were replaced with pure csi crystals .",
    "the timing resolution is improved by @xmath41 23 ; with @xmath42 600ps for @xmath43 s with e @xmath44 20 mev.@xcite the ec was moved closed to the utc to increase the coverage at the thinner corners at @xmath45 .",
    "additional pb - scintillator photon veto systems were installed behind the endcap : the collar ( co ) and micro - collar ( cm ) .",
    "the rs signals were more finely segmented , with a pmt on each end of each scintillator .",
    "this provides better de / dx resolution and more light ( @xmath411.3 p.e . ) .",
    "the tracking chambers within the rs were replaced with very low mass straw chambers ( rssc ) .",
    "the target was replaced with a much brighter scintillating fiber target ( tt ) .",
    "tests of the new fibers show @xmath41 45 more light ( 20 p.e./mev , @xmath46 = 2 m ) .",
    "an additional beam chamber was added , ( bwpc2 ) . a new erenkov ( c@xmath47 and c@xmath48 )",
    "counter with more light collection was installed .",
    "a new transient digitizing system based on gas ccd s sampling with 8 bits at 500 mhz was instrumented on the ec , tt and beam elements with ranges of 512 ns , 256ns , 256 ns respectively.@xcite a new fastbus based trigger , including a fast l1.1 trigger , was built .",
    "the l1.1 is based in an asic on the td@xcite boards and makes a pulse area to pulse height comparison to reject 90 - 95% of @xmath49 in 10 - 20 @xmath13sec .",
    "the data acquisition system was upgraded to risc based processors@xcite ( 12 cpu sgi challenge ) with a specially built vme to fastbus interface@xcite .",
    "the system is consistently able to sustain an upload of 24 mbytes in the 2 seconds between spills .    [ [ section ] ] ~",
    "the internal bremsstrahlung component ( ib ) of  has been well measured.@xcite however , the structure dependent part ,  and  , ( @xmath43 radiated from internal hadron lines ) had never been observed . a two day period of data taking in 1994 ( kb@xmath50 ) was dedicated to a measurement of  , which has an energetic @xmath13 and an energetic @xmath43.@xcite    the primary backgrounds are k@xmath9 and k@xmath34 with a missed @xmath43 and k@xmath10 with an accidental @xmath43 .",
    "these are suppressed by requiring the @xmath51 momentum to be above the endpoint of 215 mev / c , by vetoing on additional photons , and by requiring that the kinematics are consistent with  .",
    "after all cuts the background was reduced to @xmath52 events out of 2693 in the signal region .",
    "a fit to the background , ib ,  and interference components yields a branching ratio : @xmath53 which gives a determination of the form factor @xmath54 .",
    "the o(p@xmath55 ) @xmath37pt prediction for the branching ratio is @xmath56.@xcite    as a check , a measurement of the inner bremsstrahlung component of  gives @xmath57 , which can be compared to the theoretical value @xmath58 .",
    "a commissioning run with most of the new detector in 1994 produced new results on  and provided a shakedown of most of the new detector .",
    "the two modestly long running periods in 1995 and 1996 ( 24 and 17 weeks ) have provided a significant  data sample . the accumulated number of stopped kaons were @xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively .",
    "preliminary studies indicate that the backgrounds can be kept to the @xmath61 level with acceptances comparable to the previous years .",
    "during the recent ags2000 workshop a plan for making a 20% measurement of the  branching ratio ( 10% measurement of @xmath1 ) was outlined.@xcite the plan envisioned a factor of 10 increase in sensitivity per year ( allowing an observation of several events per year ) . in order to make solid extrapolations of acceptance and background rejection , no significant increases in rates",
    "are planned .",
    "the major improvement factors come from reducing the beam momentum ( and increasing the fraction of usable kaons that stop in the target ) and from increasing the duty factor of the ags",
    ". such a plan , with modest upgrades to the e787 experiment would allow the ckm model of cp violation to be critically tested .",
    "a history of the limits on the  branching ratio is shown in fig.[br_time ]    for measurements through 1991 , with some extrapolations to the near future , and some estimates of what could be done in the ags2000 era .",
    "the curves show the evolution of the theoretical predictions over time .",
    "the e787 experiment has reached a very exciting time , as the sensitivity of the experiment is now very close to the standard model prediction for  and the experiment should expect to see events soon .",
