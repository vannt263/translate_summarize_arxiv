    "the deconfinement phase transition remains the most topical problem of qcd at finite temperature .",
    "nowadays a general believe is that the formation of the magnetic monopole condensate at low temperature and its evaporation at high temperature are responsible for this phenomenon ( see , for instance , the papers @xcite - @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this scenario has been investigated either on a lattice @xcite - @xcite or in a continuum quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "the present day status of this problem is characterized by the fact that the results obtained by the former method are in agreement with that of the latter one and complement each other , although some discrepancies exist .",
    "the most important discrepancy concerns the properties of the high temperature phase .",
    "as it is well known from lattice calculations , due to asymptotic freedom at high temperature the deconfining phase is to be a gas of free quarks and gluons - quark - gluon plasma .",
    "no other macroscopic parameters except temperature are expected .",
    "however , in the continuum calculations in refs.@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite the generation of the classical chromomagnetic field of order @xmath3 was observed .",
    "this spontaneously created field is a reflection of infrared dynamics of the non - abelian gauge fields at finite temperature . in the papers @xcite ,",
    "@xcite the creation of the field was considered .",
    "the field stabilization due to the electrostatic potential ( so - called the @xmath4 condensate ) @xcite and radiation corrections to the charged gluon spectrum @xcite has been investigated for the @xmath5 gluodynamics . according to the picture derived in these papers",
    "the vacuum at high temperature is to be a stable , magnetized state .",
    "the noted discrepancy as well as some properties of the vacuum at high temperature have been discussed recently by meisinger and ogilvie @xcite . to eliminate the classical field in the deconfiming phase",
    "these authors have introduced a gluon magnetic mass on heuristic grounds . then it was observed that to have a zero field at high temperature the value of the magnetic mass substituted into the one - loop effective potential ( ep ) must be of order @xmath6 . however , the spontaneous creation of the chromomagnetic field is mutually related with infrared properties of the non - abelian gauge fields @xcite , that should be taken into consideration .",
    "this important aspect of the gauge field dynamics at high temperature needs in a more detailed investigation .",
    "moreover , the correlation corrections accounting for long distance effects should be included to find a consistent picture at high temperature @xcite .",
    "in the present paper the restored phase of qcd at high temperature is investigated within an approach including two stages of calculation .",
    "first , the consistent ep of the abelian constant chromomagnetic fields - isotopic , @xmath7 , and hypercharge , @xmath8 taking into consideration the one - loop and the daisy diagrams , which include the gluon magnetic mass insertions , is computed and the field configuration which is spontaneously generated is determined .",
    "this potential is real due to the daisies of the charged gluons , which cancel the imaginary part entering the one - loop part of the ep .",
    "as it is occurred , a specific combination of both fields is formed .",
    "second , the one - loop polarization operator ( po ) of charged gluons in these external fields is calculated .",
    "it is averaged over the gluon tree level states in the fields in order to find the radiation corrections to the spectrum . in this way",
    "the effective debye s and magnetic masses of gluons are derived .",
    "then the vacuum magnetic field strengths are used to check whether or not the charged gluon spectrum ( and therefore the magnetized vacuum ) at finite temperature is stable .",
    "as it is found , this is the case and the non trivial vacuum is favorable at high temperature in the wide interval of temperature above the decofinement transition temperature @xmath9 .",
    "hence we come to the conclusion that the scenario with the magnetized vacuum generated due to infrared dynamics of gauge fields at high temperature results in a consistent picture .",
    "the higher loop corrections can be included perturbatively within an external field problem .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect.2",
    "the charged sector of the @xmath10 gluodynamics is introduced . in sect.3 the generation of the external chromomagnetic fields is considered and the field strengths are derived . in sect.4",
    "we calculate the po in the external abelian chromomagnetic fields at finite temperature and carry out the high temperature expansion of the one - loop radiation corrections to the landau levels .",
    "the last section is devoted to the discussion of results obtained and possible applications .",
    "the lagrangian of @xmath0 gluodynamics reads @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the field strength tensor , @xmath13 is a potential of the gluon field , @xmath14 are the @xmath10 structure constants , @xmath15 .",
    "the metric is chosen to be euclidian to consider the theory at @xmath16 in the imaginary time formalism .",
    "the external chromomagnetic field is introduced by dividing the gluon field @xmath13 into the sum of the classic background field @xmath17 and the quantum field @xmath18 , @xmath19 we choose the external potential in the form @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 correspond to constant chromomagnetic fields directed along the third axis of the euclidean space and @xmath23 and @xmath24 of the colour @xmath10-space , respectively : @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "the gauge fixing term in the eq.([one ] ) is @xmath28 and @xmath29 represents the ghost lagrangian .",
    "the components @xmath18 with @xmath30 correspond to the charged gluons .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the `` charged basis '' of fields @xmath18 ( @xmath30 ) by the expressions @xmath31 after simple algebra , one obtains the lagrangian of the charged gluons in the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , are covariant derivatives , @xmath37 , @xmath38 @xmath39 for @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ five ] ) is a starting point of our analysis .",
    "first , let us investigate the spontaneous vacuum magnetization in the high temperature @xmath10 gluodynamics , charged sector of which is described by the lagrangian ( [ five ] ) . for this purpose",
    "we apply the method of the effective lagrangian .",
    "the detailed evaluations of the one - loop effective lagrangian in finite - temperature @xmath5 gluonodynamics have been carried out in refs.@xcite,@xcite .",
    "performing them for our case we arrive at the following result for the high - temperature limit of @xmath59 : @xmath60 + \\frac{1}{3\\pi}(gh_{3})^{\\frac{3}{2}}\\frac{t}{3\\pi}&\\nonumber\\\\ & { \\displaystyle}-\\frac{h_{8}^{2}}{2}-\\frac{11}{16}\\frac{g^{2}}{\\pi^{2}}h_{8}^{2}\\ln[\\frac{t}{\\mu } ] + ( \\lambda_{+}^{\\frac{3}{2 } } + |\\lambda_{-}|^{\\frac{3}{2 } } ) ( \\frac{3}{2})^{\\frac{3}{4}}(gh_{8})^{\\frac{3}{2}}\\frac{t}{3\\pi}&\\nonumber\\\\ & { \\displaystyle}+i[(gh_{3})^{\\frac{3}{2 } } + ( \\lambda_{+}^{\\frac{3}{2 } } + |\\lambda_{-}|^{\\frac{3}{2 } } ) ( \\frac{3}{2})^{\\frac{3}{4}}(gh_{8})^{\\frac{3}{2 } } ] \\frac{t}{2\\pi},&\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 , @xmath62 is a renormalization point .",
    "the imaginary part in the expression ( [ ten ] ) signals for the vacuum instability and must be considered carefully .",
    "namely , as it will be shown below , the inclusion of ring diagrams , @xmath63 , leads to canceling the imaginary parts so that the whole expression @xmath58 becomes real . to see this ,",
    "let us consider the contribution of the ring diagrams which correspond to the unstable modes of the charged gluons :      where @xmath65 ,  @xmath66 are the matsubara frequencies .",
    "to obtain ( [ eleven ] ) one has merely to put @xmath54 and @xmath55 in the expression for @xmath67 .",
    "an elementary integration gives @xmath68^{\\frac{1}{2}}&\\nonumber\\\\ & { \\displaystyle}-~\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2 } } \\lambda_{+ } \\frac{gh_{8}t}{2\\pi } [ \\pi^{r=2}(h_{3},h_{8},t)-\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2 } } \\lambda_{+ } gh_{8}]^{\\frac{1}{2 } } & \\nonumber\\\\ & { \\displaystyle}-~\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2 } } \\lambda_{- } \\frac{gh_{8}t}{2\\pi } [ \\pi^{r=3}(h_{3},h_{8},t)-\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2 } } \\lambda_{- } gh_{8}]^{\\frac{1}{2 } } & \\nonumber\\\\ & { \\displaystyle}-i[(gh_{3})^{\\frac{3}{2 } } + ( \\lambda_{+}^{\\frac{3}{2 } } + |\\lambda_{-}|^{\\frac{3}{2 } } ) ( \\frac{3}{2})^{\\frac{3}{4}}(gh_{8})^{\\frac{3}{2 } } ] \\frac{t}{2\\pi}.&\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from eq.([ten ] ) and ( [ twelve ] ) it is seen that imaginary parts are cancelled out in the total .",
    "the final effective lagrangian @xmath58 is real if the relations @xmath69 @xmath70 and @xmath71 hold .",
    "our problem is divided into two separate parts : first , one has to calculate the spontaneously generated fields in the vacuum and , second , to compute @xmath85 , which are the average values of the charged gluon po taken in the tree level states .    to derive the strengths of the generated fields one has to solve the set of the stationary equations : @xmath86 @xmath87 there are three nontrivial solutions : @xmath88 @xmath89 and @xmath90 the terms of @xmath91 that depend on the magnetic masses of the transversal modes are not included in the expressions ( [ seventeen])-([ninteen ] ) because their contributions are of higher order in @xmath82 .",
    "note that the latter of these configurations corresponds to the minimum of the ep and we , therefore , conclude that both chromomagnetic fields have to be arised spontaneously at high temperature .    in determining the solutions ( [ seventeen ] )",
    "-([ninteen ] ) , the logarithmic terms @xmath92 $ ] were omitted as negligibly small .",
    "this approximation is appropriate for the region @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the deconfinement phase transition temperature .",
    "however , in the limit @xmath95 , the logarithmic terms become large and should be accounted for . to analyze the asymptotic region",
    "the solutions of the above stationary equations must be rewritten in terms of the effective coupling constant @xmath96)^{-1}.\\ ] ] for this purpose one has merely to eliminate the tree - level terms in the @xmath84 .",
    "it turns out that , at @xmath97 , the field configuration @xmath98 delivers the global minimum of the ep .",
    "that is only the isotopic chromomagnetic field is generated at asymptotically high temperatures .",
    "if the temperature decreases , the hypercharge @xmath2 field appears below some temperature @xmath99 , and in the deconfinement region @xmath100 , where the terms @xmath101 $ ] are small in comparison with the tree - level ones , both fields are present .",
    "the next question that must be answered is whether the obtained in ( [ ninteen ] ) chromomagnetic fields @xmath1 and @xmath2 are stable .",
    "this sufficiently complicate problem requires an explicit calculation of the polarization operator of the charged gluons in the external fields @xmath1 and @xmath2 .    in the one - loop approximation",
    "the po of the charged gluons is determined by the standard set of diagrams in fig .",
    "1 , where double wavy lines represent the green function @xmath102 for the charged gluons , dashed double lines represent the green function @xmath103 for the charged ghost fields .",
    "thin wavy and thin dashed lines correspond to the neutral gluon fields @xmath104 and the neutral ghost fields @xmath105 , respectively . in the operator form the above green functions are given by the expressions ( in feynmann s gauge )    @xmath106^{-1},\\ ] ] @xmath107^{-1},\\qquad d(p)=-\\frac{1}{p^2}.\\ ] ]    to calculate the po we make use of the proper time representation and the schwinger operator formalism @xcite .",
    "the po of the charged gluons in a chromomagnetic field at nonzero temperature can be written as @xmath108 where @xmath109\\bigr\\},\\\\ \\gamma_{\\mu\\alpha,\\rho}&=&\\delta_{\\mu\\alpha}(2p - k)_\\rho+\\delta_{\\alpha\\rho } ( 2k - p)_\\mu+\\delta_{\\mu\\rho}(p+k)_\\alpha,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 for @xmath114 and @xmath115 for @xmath116 , respectively , the constant @xmath117 is defined above .",
    "we restrict our consideration to the case of a high temperature limit . in eq.([twentyone ] ) this limit corresponds to the @xmath118 term in the sum over @xmath119 @xcite . to evaluate the expression for the po we used the schwinger proper - time method modified for the case of the high temperature ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "thus , the average over the physical states values for the gluon po and the debye mass squared of charged gluons can be presented as        where @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath49 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 @xmath130 the explicit expressions of the functions @xmath131 and @xmath132 are complicate and have in general the same forms as in the case of @xmath5 theory considered in @xcite . however , for our analysis we need only the asymptotic expressions for @xmath131 and @xmath132 when @xmath133 , and @xmath134 that corresponds to the high - temperature expansion , @xmath135 ( see @xcite ) . without loss of generality ,",
    "the calculations can be carried out in the reference frame @xmath136 . performing integrations we obtain @xmath137 the sign `` + '' in expressions ( [ twentyfour ] )",
    "should be taken for @xmath138 and the sign `` - '' corresponds accordingly to @xmath139 ( @xmath43 is an index of the charged basis ( [ four ] ) ) . from eqs .",
    "( [ ninteen ] ) and ( [ twentyfour ] ) it is seen that the real parts of the po are positive in the ground and excited states .",
    "the imaginary parts in the expressions @xmath140 and @xmath141 occur due to the nonanalyticity of a number of terms in the integrands in the r.h.s . of eqs .",
    "( [ twentytwo]),([twentythree ] ) for large @xmath142 .",
    "the integration contour that ensures the convergence of integrals with respect to @xmath143 results in the imaginary parts in expressions ( [ twentyfour ] ) .",
    "the imaginary part of the radiation corrections describes the decay of the state owing to transitions to the states with lower energies .",
    "the first term in the expression @xmath141 is calculated by performing summation over the discrete frequencies @xmath119 and can not be obtained from eq.([twentythree ] ) .",
    "the second one represents the next - to - leading term and is calculated by using a high temperature static limit .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath141 for @xmath54 describes the landau damping of the ground state plasmon quasi - particles .",
    "it is important to note that the imaginary parts entering the @xmath141 and the @xmath144 are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "since a spin interaction does not affect the former correction and whereas the tachyonic state in the field is excited just due to the spin interaction of charged gluons , one has to conclude that the non - zero imaginary part of the latter function does not correspond to the instability of the chromomagnetic fields and also describes a usual damping of states at finite temperature .",
    "thus , to verify whether or not the radiation corrections in the external fields stabilize the spectrum at high temperature one should calculate the gluon effective mass squared determined by the real part of the function @xmath145 at one - loop level . if it is positive - the spectrum , and hence the vacuum , is stable .",
    "we investigated the qcd restored phase . as it was found from the ep accounting for the one - loop plus daisy",
    "diagrams the vacuum with non - zero abelian chromomagnetic fields @xmath7 and @xmath8 is favorable energetically .",
    "it is stable due to the magnetic masses of charged gluons which have to be included into consideration when the value of the background fields is estimated .",
    "these masses are computed from the gluon one - loop polarization operator in the external fields .",
    "as it occurs , the charged gluon spectrum in the fields accounting for the tree plus the one - loop corrections is stable in a wide interval of temperature above the @xmath9 .",
    "important notice , in the field presence the gluon magnetic mass @xmath146 is generated in one - loop order , in contrast to what happens in the case of the trivial vacuum where the mass @xmath147 is a non - perturbative effect @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . since the order of the magnetic vacuum field is @xmath148 , the order of the magnetic mass squared is @xmath149 .",
    "that is , the order of the magnetic mass is the same in both calculation methods .",
    "clearly that the former case is also non - perturbative because the field is taken into account exactly through the green functions . if one accounts for the magnetic field perturbatively , zero result follows @xcite .",
    "of course , the stabilization of the gluon spectrum by radiation corrections in the fields is an interesting fact which could not be expected beforehand .",
    "it was observed already in @xmath5 gluodynamics @xcite and here for the @xmath0 gauge group .",
    "one may believe that this is the case for other non - abelian gauge groups and therefore the stabilization is the reflection of the intrinsic dynamics of fields .",
    "note here that other mechanism of the field stabilization was discussed in ref.@xcite which takes into account the generation of the electrostatic gauge field potential ( @xmath4 condensate ) . but this picture was not investigated consistently since the common generation of the @xmath4 and magnetic fields has not been considered .",
    "some aspects of the influence of the @xmath4 condensate on magnetic field have been investigated recently in one - loop order in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "consider in more detail the values of the gluon magnetic mass determined in different calculations and compare these with the value of the vacuum magnetic field . in recent paper @xcite in @xmath5 gluodynamics to stabilize the one - loop effective potential the gluon magnetic mass @xmath150 of order @xmath151 was introduced on heuristic grounds .",
    "then , in particular , it has been found that for @xmath152 the effective potential has a global minimum at @xmath153 .",
    "hence it was concluded that a sufficiently heavy magnetic mass leads to the trivial vacuum of the deconfinement phase .",
    "this critical value is close to the magnetic masses determined in a number of lattice simulations : 0.505 @xmath154 @xcite , 0.360 @xmath154 @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to compare our result for the magnetic mass identified with the effective mass of gluon @xmath155 and the field @xmath156 for @xmath5 sector .",
    "simple estimate gives @xmath157 that is close to the value derived by philipsen . for this values we observed the stabilization of the magnetized vacuum . on the other hand ,",
    "this value is insufficient to have a zero vacuum field , if the approach of the paper @xcite is adopted .",
    "moreover , if one takes into account the structure of the magnetic mass , @xmath158 , there is no possibility to have zero for the generated field .",
    "so , we believe that the magnetized vacuum has to be considered seriously not an artificial mathematical fact .",
    "other important point which we are going to discuss is the influence of higher loop contributions .",
    "first we note that the one loop plus daisy graphs account for the long distance contributions and give the main effects .",
    "it was realized already in the related problem on the electroweak phase transition in strong magnetic fields @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the results obtained within this ep are in a good agreement with that of found in the nonperturbative approach refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ( see also recent survey @xcite )",
    ". the most important feature of this approximation is that the ep is real at sufficiently high temperatures and therefore the spontaneously generated magnetic fields are stable .",
    "we believe that the higher loop corrections will not change qualitatively the results obtained and the results on the stable magnetize vacuum survive . to check our results the resummations on the super daisy level have to be carried out .",
    "that is the problem for future .",
    "it is interesting to compare our results with that of obtained in lattice calculations by cea and cosmai @xcite , @xcite . in the former paper",
    "the creation of the colour abelian chromomagnetic was investigated by means of the lattice schrdinger functional .",
    "it was observed that at @xmath159 the applied external chromomagnetic field is completely screened by the vacuum . at finite temperature the applied field is supported by the temperature and is increased with the growth of temperature .",
    "that is in correspondence with our calculations . in the latter paper",
    "the influence of the external fields on the deconfinement phase transition has been investigated and an intimate connection between abelian chromomagnetic field and colour confinement was observed .",
    "this interesting result is not directly related with obtained in the present paper because we do not consider the field as external one . from our results",
    "it follows that in the deconfinement phase the abelian chromomagnetic fields have to present .",
    "so , we have to answer how the spontaneous vacuum magnetization affects the temperature of the phase transition ."
