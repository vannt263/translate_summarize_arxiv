    "the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) is a joint nasa ",

    "it is expected to be launched in the year 2012 , and to start collecting scientific data approximately a year later , after reaching its final orbital configuration @xcite .",
    "lisa consists of three widely separated spacecraft flying in a triangular , almost equilateral configuration , and exchanging coherent laser beams ; gravitational waves ( gws ) will be measured by picometer interferometry as modulations in the distance between the spacecraft .",
    "lisa , which will operate in a lower frequency band than ground - based gw interferometers , holds the promise of providing access to entirely new classes of gw sources , but it also introduces complications unknown to ground - based detectors , such as the complex signal and noise transfer functions , the problem of canceling the otherwise overwhelming laser phase noise in an unequal - arm interferometer , the necessity of dealing simultaneously with many continuous signals ( including a confusion - noise background of galactic white - dwarf binaries ) , and the possibility of using multiple interferometric observables as a virtual network of gw interferometers .",
    "these complications hinder the analytical characterization of lisa s detection capabilities as a function of its configuration , as well as the development of data - analysis techniques aimed at specific gw sources .",
    "computer simulations will therefore play a crucial role in exploring lisa s performance , in obtaining insight about its optimal operation , and in prototyping and testing data - analysis protocols .    in this paper",
    "we report on three numerical investigations performed with _ synthetic lisa _",
    ", a software package that we developed at the jet propulsion laboratory to simulate the lisa science process at the interface of scientific and technical mission requirements .",
    "all investigations focus on outstanding implementation issues for time - delay interferometry ( tdi ) , the lisa - specific technique currently envisaged to suppress the otherwise overwhelming laser phase noise by combining ( with delays ) the basic lisa phase measurements aboard the three spacecraft into composite laser - noise  free observables ( see sec .",

    "sec : expsecondgen ] , we give the first quantitative estimate , based on a straight simulation , of the improvement in laser - noise stabilization that would eliminate the need for second - generation tdi for a realistic flexing lisa array @xcite using standard michelson observables .",
    "we find that an rms improvement factor between 3 and 10 is sufficient .",
    "we give also numerical evidence of effective laser - noise subtraction with second - generation observables .",
    "2 .   in sec .",
    "[ sec : exparmlengths ] , we evaluate the armlength - ranging accuracy @xcite that would be required for effective laser - noise cancellation in first- and second - generation tdi michelson observables .",
    "we find that ranging accuracies between 30 m and 100 m ( rms ) are adequate when simple linear extrapolation is used to compute the armlengths between measurements .",
    "3 .   in sec .",
    "[ sec : quantize ] , we estimate the granularity that can be allowed in the quantization of phase measurements while preserving effective laser - noise cancellation . assuming white laser frequency noise bandlimited at 1 hz , we find that a total of 3234 ( or 3638 ) bits per sample are needed for the michelson observables of first - generation ( second - generation ) tdi .",
    "we present these results as representative of the numerical experiments that become possible with state - of - the - art simulators such as _ synthetic lisa _ , and we suggest possible directions of investigation in the final section of this paper .    _ synthetic lisa _ represents the evolution of previous simulation tools developed in the lisa project @xcite . among other improvements , _",
    "synthetic lisa _ is based on a complete model of tdi : the lisa armlengths change realistically with the motion of the array ; the laser beams propagate causally ; and a full set of tdi combinations can be generated .",
    "_ synthetic lisa _",
    "joins other existing software that simulates the lisa response to noise and gws , such as the well - established _ lisa simulator _ by n.  cornish and l.  rubbo @xcite .",
    "why write a new simulator , then ?",
    "being able to rely on a plurality of simulation tools allows for mutual validation and verification , which is crucial if implementation choices must be predicated on the results of numerical experiments .",
    "in addition , the two simulators have a slightly different focus . the _ lisa simulator _",
    "was conceived to interface source simulations to data analysis , while _",
    "synthetic lisa _ was targeted to explore the interaction between lisa science and technology , and it must therefore operate at a lower level of abstraction : in particular , _ synthetic lisa",

    ", it operates at a higher level of abstraction than integrated - modeling simulations @xcite : it does not need to model spacecraft subsystems , but rather it assumes nominal specifications of their performance .",

    "the doppler measurements bear the imprint of the instrumental noises and of the gw signals , but the latter can be read off efficiently only from the tdi observables , which are free of the otherwise overwhelming laser phase noise and optical - bench noise .",
    "the time - dependent geometry of laser propagation across the lisa array influences the effect of the lisa noises and ( especially ) of gw signals on the doppler measurements ; a precise knowledge of geometry is needed also to build the tdi observables in such a way that laser phase noise and optical - bench noise are canceled effectively . in this section we go through all the elements of fig .",
    "[ fig : lisablock ] , and discuss in detail how they are modeled in _ synthetic lisa_. in sec .",

    "the motion of the lisa array is complex : at the qualitative level , the three lisa spacecraft maintain a quasi - equilateral triangular configuration ( where the arms stay equal to about 1% ) trailing the earth along its orbit in the plane of the ecliptic ; at the same time , the constellation maintains an inclination of @xmath5 with respect to the plane of the ecliptic ( as measured from the normal of the instantaneous plane of the lisa constellation to the normal to the plane of the ecliptic ) , and it performs a cartwheeling motion , rotating around the normal to the instantaneous lisa plane with a rotation period of a year .",
    "this picture is realized in practice by placing the three spacecraft on eccentric , inclined solar orbits @xcite .",
    "this pattern of motion improves the sensitivity of lisa to gw signals , making it more homogeneous over the sky ( because the dependence of the antenna patterns to source position is averaged during the year ) , and improving the estimation of source position and polarization ( because the gw responses become modulated by the variation of the antenna patterns ) .",
    "this added sensitivity comes at the price of complicating the gw response : the modulations induced by the changing orientation of the lisa plane spread the power of originally monochromatic gw signals , generating several sidebands at frequency multiples of @xmath6 @xcite ; furthermore , the relative motion of the detector with respect to the gw source introduces a time - dependent doppler shift , which is the dominant effect for signals above @xmath7 hz [ the characteristic bandwidth of the doppler shifting is @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the gw frequency and @xmath10 is the lisa orbital angular velocity ] .",
    "when lisa is in operation , each spacecraft will exchange laser beams with the other two , measuring the phase of the arriving laser beams with respect to the local lasers ; the laser beams are bounced off freely - falling proof masses that are shielded by the spacecraft from most external disturbances , so that they can serve as references for the measurement of gws . to implement this measurement scheme ,",
    "each spacecraft will carry two lasers , two proof masses , and two optical - readout schemes .",
    "figure [ fig : assembly ] presents a schematic diagram ( adapted from ref .",
    "@xcite ) of the proof - mass and optical - bench assemblies within one of the lisa spacecraft , labeled `` 1 '' ; the other two spacecraft have identical setups . in short :    1 .",
    "the left - hand bench receives the laser beam from spacecraft 2 , bounces it off its proof mass , and compares it with the local laser ( without bouncing the latter ) at the upper photodetector ; 2 .   via an optical fiber ,",
    "the left - hand bench receives the right - hand ",
    "bench laser and compares it with the local laser ( without bouncing the latter ) at the lower photodetector ; 3 .",
    "the left bench sends out the local laser ( without bouncing it ) to spacecraft 2 , and ( after bouncing it off the other side of its proof mass ) to the right - hand bench .",
    "the operation of the right - hand bench ( and indeed , of the benches on the other two spacecraft ) is similar .",
    "[ a recent candidate redesign of the optical benches @xcite would implement the comparison of the two lasers on the two benches of the same spacecraft by measuring their phases separately , doing away with the optical fiber , and then subtracting the measurements . for the purpose of obtaining the laser - noise  free tdi signals ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : tdi ] ) this modification amounts only to a redefinition of the intra - spacecraft phase measurements @xcite , so in this paper , and indeed in _",
    "synthetic lisa _ , we refer to the older architecture . ]    in this setup , the physical observable of interest is the comparison of phase between the local laser and the incoming laser , which carries information about the variations induced by gws in the inter - spacecraft optical path .",
    "the phase fluctuations of the lasers , however , are much larger than the gw - induced phase shifts , and must be subtracted before gws can be resolved . in the last few years , a number of authors collaborated to develop a scheme ( _ time - delay interferometry _ , or tdi ) to subtract laser noise by carefully combining time - shifted series of the inter- and intra - spacecraft phase measurements ; if the lasers are not phase - locked to a master ( see the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : tdi ] ) , the intra - spacecraft phase measurements carry no information about gws , but they do carry a combination of the phase noises from the lasers within each spacecraft .    , 2 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , as indicated .",

    "thus , tdi represents the lisa readouts as _ basic doppler observables _ : @xmath21 is the fractional frequency difference at time @xmath22 between the beam received at spacecraft @xmath16(eceiver ) from spacecraft @xmath15(ender ) and the local laser ; and @xmath23 is the analogous intra - spacecraft measurement _ on the same optical bench _ ( thus , although it carries the index @xmath15 it is in fact the fractional frequency difference between the two lasers of spacecraft @xmath16 ) . in this paper , the index @xmath24(ink ) denotes the ( oriented ) lisa arm along which the laser was transmitted , according to the cyclical indexing @xmath17 for @xmath18 , and @xmath19 for @xmath20 ( thus , @xmath25 ) .",

    "[ fig : assembly ] , we label the left - hand and right - hand optical benches ( and their lasers ) as @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively ( more generally , unstarred benches transmit into oriented arms with negative indices ) . following estabrook and colleagues @xcite ,",

    "synthetic lisa _ ) we take the optical - fiber noises and the optical - bench motions to be negligible .",
    "in fact , optical - fiber noise is removed in tdi by always using the @xmath65 observables in pairs such as @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and so on .",
    "one sees also that the optical - bench motions along the lines of sight ( e.g. , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 ) can be absorbed in the corresponding laser frequency noise variables ( e.g. , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 ) , because they are appear in @xmath74 and @xmath75 with the same indices and the same evaluation times .",
    "thus , if the tdi observables can successfully subtract laser frequency noise , they will also subtract the optical - bench motions , which are generally several orders of magnitude smaller .    in writing eqs .",

    ", can be formulated as the convolution of the sampled sequence with an interpolating kernel that is ( in some sense ) an approximation to the sinc .",
    "the tradeoff in the approximation is between the number of samples used to interpolate and the sharpness of the spectral response .",
    "the correct sampling of a bandlimited process preserves all the spectral information below the nyquist frequency , but it populates fourier space with infinitely many replicas of the original spectrum , centered at frequencies @xmath283 ( for @xmath284 ) . the effect of sinc interpolation is to multiply this composite spectrum by the fourier transform of the sinc , which is a perfect square window of height 1 and width @xmath285 , centered at @xmath286 .",
    "thus , sinc interpolation achieves perfect signal reconstruction by selecting only the original spectrum and deleting all unwanted replicas .",
    "practical schemes with kernels of finite extent can not have such a sharp frequency response , so they distort ( i.e. , amplify or suppress , depending on frequency ) the original spectral content in the passband below @xmath191 , and they allow some of the power of the unwanted spectral replicas to creep back into the interpolated process ( either directly , if the process is sampled with a sufficiently high nyquist frequency , or by aliasing to frequencies in the passband ) .    these effects can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : interpolation ] , which shows a spectrum of pseudorandom white noise , generated with a timestep of 1 s , and resampled to a timestep of 0.1 s , using no interpolation ( i.e. , defaulting to the nearest 1-s sample ) , using linear interpolation , and using lagrange - polynomial interpolation of order 4 , 8 , and 32 . in all cases",
    ", power begins to drop before the nominal bandlimit frequency of 0.5 hz , but the drop is sharper and closer to 0.5 hz for higher - order interpolation methods .",
    "spurious power above the bandlimit frequency appears as _ ripples _ between the @xmath191 harmonics : the height of the ripples decreases with the interpolation order , while the valleys among the ripples become wider . in fig .",
    "[ fig : interpolation ] , the valleys appear to be cut off by a common downgrading envelope ; this is an artifact of spectral estimation , due to the residual leakage from the platform below the passband ; spectral leakage also smears out to a finite height the nulls at the @xmath191 harmonics .    in _ synthetic lisa _ , interpolated pseudorandom white noise is used to stand in for the standard laser phase noise of sec .",
    "[ sec : noiseresponse ] .",
    "the standard proof - mass and optical - path noises , which have colored spectra , are approximated by applying simple digital time - domain filters to the uncorrelated deviates , before interpolation .",
    "namely , the finite - difference filter @xmath287 = x[n \\delta t ] - x[(n-1 ) \\delta t]$ ] ( with @xmath229 the original noise sequence ) has power transfer function @xmath288 , and is used to approximate the standard @xmath208 proof - mass noise .",
    "the damped - integrator filter @xmath287 = \\alpha y[(n-1 ) \\delta t ] + x[n \\delta t]$ ] ( with @xmath289 , to control the dc component of @xmath3 ) has power transfer function @xmath290 , and is used to approximate the standard @xmath209 optical - path noise .",
    "the resulting pseudorandom noises have power spectra that adhere very faithfully to the nominal curves , except at frequencies comparable to @xmath191 , where the effect of interpolation is that noise power is not cut off sharply , but rather drops off smoothly ( if rapidly ) , with nulls at the @xmath191 harmonics . for the optical - path and proof - mass noises ,",
    "the effect of interpolation is compounded by the effect of the finite - difference and finite - integration time - domain filters , whose transfer function near @xmath191 is proportional to @xmath291 $ ] rather than @xmath292 . we conclude that the pseudorandom noises can be accurate representations of the standard lisa noises of sec .  [",
    "sec : noiseresponse ] , and therefore can be used to study the noise response of the tdi observables , as long as we take into account the effects of interpolation and filtering at frequencies comparable to @xmath191 . because tdi is essentially a linear operation ,",
    "the results at lower frequencies will not be affected .",
    "using linear interpolation ( the _ synthetic lisa _ default ) , it is probably safe to draw conclusions from the tdi results at frequencies @xmath293 ; using higher - order interpolation , it becomes possible to push inferences to higher frequencies .",
    "this discussion of filtering and interpolation applies also to noise objects provided by the user as sampled time series , as long as the sampled noise can be considered bandlimited below its nominal nyquist frequency .",
