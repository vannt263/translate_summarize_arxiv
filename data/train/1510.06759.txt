    "below the scale at which strong gravitational effects become relevant , gravity can be treated as an effective theory @xcite . in pure einstein gravity , this strong coupling scale is simply given by the reduced planck mass @xmath3 gev .",
    "in the presence of matter , the strong coupling scale is lowered as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is shorthand for a weighted index that counts the total numbers of particles of different spins present . as reviewed in @xcite",
    ", one can understand this result in a variety of ways for which we offer our own simple derivation in the next section . on the other hand , the effective strength of gravity ",
    "@xmath0  is in principle an independent quantity .",
    "one determines @xmath0 via local scattering experiments , say a test ( point ) mass scattering off of a heavier mass . as we also review shortly , depending on the process in question and its scale , @xmath6 counts the number @xmath7 of species that can mediate _ tree - level _ interactions of gravitational strength . during inflation for example in the presence of large ( but stabilized ) extra dimensions , processes that couple only to the transverse traceless ( tt ) polarizations of the graviton",
    "will turn up the scale corresponding to @xmath8 where @xmath9 counts the number of tt kaluza - klein ( kk ) resonances with masses below the momentum transfer in question .",
    "processes that couple only to the longitudinal polarization of the graviton ( equivalently , processes mediated by species that couple to the trace of the energy momentum ( em ) tensor ) on the other hand see the scale corresponding to @xmath7 where @xmath10 where @xmath11 effectively counts the ( non kk ) _ universally coupled _",
    "species contributing to the process in question in addition to any kk graviscalars whose couplings or expectation values may have shifted between laboratory scales and the scale of inflation .",
    "_ in what follows , the term universally coupled specifically refers to all species that can mediate tree - level exchange processes between covariantly conserved sources . _    in this note , we further elaborate upon these facts and their consequences for _ inferring _ absolute scales from observable quantities during inflation . in doing so",
    ", we address various concerns raised in a recent paper @xcite , where firstly it was reasoned that kk gravitons could not contribute towards lowering @xmath0 during inflation since this would require their masses to be less than the hubble scale , seemingly in violation of the higuchi bound @xcite . a straightforward corollary of this reasoning however , would be that it is impossible for the compactification scale to be less than the effective cosmological constant , implying a powerful no go theorem for compactifications were it true .",
    "we demonstrate by explicit example and proof that as expected from the underlying consistency of higher dimensional einstein gravity , that kk gravitons evade the higuchi bound .",
    "secondly , it was reasoned in @xcite that universally coupled species that are not tt spin-2 excitations could not affect the inferred scale of inflation from a positive detection of primordial tensors , since the former could nt have generated perturbations that linearly source b - mode polarization in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite .",
    "this reasoning is inaccurate since it neglects to treat gravity as an effective theory and ( as we remind the reader shortly ) results in the inconsistent corollary that it would be possible to infer a scale for inflation beyond the scale at which a classical description of spacetime breaks down . a more careful examination of how one connects theoretical quantities to what is extracted from the cmb confirms the basic conclusions of @xcite ; that inferring an absolute scale of inflation is complicated by the uncertainty in @xmath0 : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the observed tensor to scalar ratio and @xmath14 with the caveat that one can only trust this inference if the resulting curvature is such that @xmath15 , or @xmath16 with @xmath5 being the total number of species in our theory and @xmath17 is the hubble factor during inflation ( the above is nothing more than the obvious requirement that @xmath18 ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as we elaborate upon further , non kk universally coupled species can violate the so - called single field tensor to scalar consistency relation even as the spectral properties of the anisotropies remain unchanged .",
    "some of our findings are direct corollaries of results established elsewhere @xcite while others are obvious in hindsight although evidently obscured by a number of moving parts .",
    "therefore , we err on the side of detail in the following treatment , clarifying various details omitted in @xcite and presenting the observation on the nature of the higuchi bound alluded to in the title .",
    "readers interested only in the latter result and any wider lessons to be drawn are invited to skip to the conclusion and appendices .",
    "we begin by reviewing aspects of how short distance gravity can differ from macroscopic gravity in a general context after which we fix to the specific setting of inflationary cosmology .",
    "we derive the implications of @xmath0 and @xmath1 differing from the macroscopic strength of gravity ( set by @xmath19 gev ) for cosmological observables and in particular , inferring an absolute energy scale for inflation , after which we address concerns raised in @xcite and conclude . along the way",
    ", we draw attention to the fact that the process dependence of @xmath0 can result in a violation of the single - field tensor to scalar consistency relation , in addition to the fact that any positive detection of primordial tensors necessarily bounds the _ total _ number of species in the universe , hidden or otherwise .",
    "in the absence of matter , gravity becomes strongly coupled as the momentum transfer for any given process approaches the ( reduced ) planck scale @xmath3 gev or when the background curvature approaches @xmath20 . in the presence of matter , the strong coupling scale is lowered as @xmath21 , where @xmath5 is shorthand for a weighted sum that counts the total number of species present .",
    "a direct understanding is arrived at , for example , from the effective action one obtains after integrating out an arbitrary particle spectrum of massive particles minimally coupled to gravity , initially described by the einstein - hilbert action : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is some arbitrary matter sector and @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote recognizable dimensionful couplings that are subject to renormalization .",
    "all graviton scattering amplitudes ( or on shell sub - amplitudes ) can be calculated from the effective action that results from integrating out the matter fields . to one loop , these amplitudes are reproduced by the effective action @xmath26 where the ellipses denote higher order contributions in the curvature and loop expansion .",
    "the coefficient of the einstein - hilbert term and the cosmological constant are fixed by measurements with the ` bare ' terms in ( [ s1 ] ) absorbing the divergences after dimensionally regularizing , and where @xmath27 represents a weighted sum over all massive species present with the @xmath28 calculable in terms of the spins of the particles integrated out @xcite .",
    "given that @xmath29 we see from counting derivatives that the perturbative expansion breaks down when the momentum transfer approaches @xmath30 or when the background curvature approaches @xmath31 both of which are manifestations of the fact in the presence of an arbitrary spectrum of particles , the scale at which strong gravity effects become relevant is set by ( [ scs ] )  @xmath32 .",
    "crucially , we note that _ the maximum allowed curvature before a classical description of spacetime breaks _ down is given by @xmath33 instead of @xmath34 as would be the case in a purely gravitational theory , a fact that is not without consequence for inflationary cosmology .    on the other hand ,",
    "the effective strength of gravity at any given scale , set by @xmath0 , is an independent quantity .",
    "although all massive species lower the strong coupling scale as ( [ scs ] ) , only those which mediate tree level interactions between covariantly conserved sources can enhance the strength of gravitational interactions ( the latter being our definition of _ universally coupled _",
    "species ) immediately below distance scales smaller than their inverse compton wavelength , precisely when the effective theory starts to break down @xcite . ] .",
    "this occurs independently of the process for kaluza - klein ( kk ) resonances and in a process dependent ( i.e. equivalence principle violating ) manner for species that couple to the trace of the em tensor of the source : @xmath35 where @xmath7 counts the number of species contributing to ( and with masses below ) the momentum transfer of the tree level process in question . as an example of the latter",
    ", one can contemplate ( kk ) graviscalars , 4-dimensional ( 4d ) scalars or vector bosons with explicit non - minimal couplings to gravity ( hence coupling to the trace of the energy momentum tensor of any source ) or which mediate effective interactions via higher dimensional operators ",
    "e.g. dimension 5 in the case of pseudo - scalar exchange @xcite or dimension 6 in the context of higgs effective field theory @xcite for all momentum transfer up to the scale @xmath1 as was done in @xcite , where @xmath1 can be lowered arbitrarily by engineering an appropriate field content . ] .",
    "one can understand the lowering of @xmath0 immediately above the threshold @xmath36 where the latter denotes the mass of the species by first considering what happens for a kk graviton .",
    "for a given tt kk resonance with mass @xmath36 , that tree level graviton exchange between any two conserved sources is augmented as ( suppressing tensor structure for simplicity ) :    @xmath37 where @xmath38 counts the number of contributing kk polarizations of mass @xmath36 ( as illustrated above ) . hence in the regime @xmath39",
    "we remain within the regime of validity of our effective theory and the tree level exchange effectively becomes @xmath40 implying an increase in the strength of gravity at distances smaller than @xmath41 but greater than @xmath42 as per ( [ sg ] ) .",
    "consider now the effects of any other universally coupled ( non kk ) species , for example the higgs via the dimension 6 effective operators coupled to scalar or fermionic matter : @xmath43 which evidently couples the singlet component of the higgs @xmath44 to the trace of the energy - momentum tensor of any conserved source made up of @xmath45 or @xmath46 quanta with the effective interaction @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs in the phase we re doing perturbation theory in .",
    "one finds an identical enhancement to gravitational interactions as in ( [ tl ] ) with the replacement @xmath49 similar enhancements can come from kk graviscalars  when more than one extra dimension is compactified , there are always extra scalar polarizations @xmath50 distinct from the scalar mode of the massive 4d graviton which couple to the trace of the em tensor : @xmath51 with @xmath52 , a constant numerical factor @xcite .",
    "as soon as the momentum transfer exceeds the mass of any of these scalar kk resonances , one finds an enhancement akin to ( [ mple ] ) with @xmath53 per resonance .",
    "one thus concludes that for cavendish experiments performed with point masses , @xmath54 where @xmath7 stands for a process dependent weighted index .",
    "so what , if any consequences do the facts reviewed above have for cosmological observations involving curvature and tensor perturbations ?",
    "not so many as it turns out , since observable quantities are always dimensionless and therefore independent of the units in which they are expressed ( planck units being the naturally available scale in early universe cosmology ) .",
    "the amplitude and spectral properties of the cmb anisotropies in particular are unaffected by any of the considerations above . however , in trying to _ infer _ an energy scale of inflation , one necessarily runs up against the fact that @xmath55 , and that the absolute scale of inflation is uncertain up to our lack of knowledge of @xmath0 beyond laboratory scales .    to see this",
    ", we first fix a particular context for the purposes of demonstration even though the results generalize @xcite . from the outset",
    ", we stress that we work in the context of single field inflation .",
    "any other fields present therefore couple to the inflaton only through gravitational strength interactions . secondly , we work in a 4d context , even though we allow for kk gravitons to be excited .",
    "that is , kk masses are set by the size of extra dimensions ( i.e. the expectation value of the moduli that parametrize them ) which is an independent parameter from the masses of these moduli , given some stabilization mechanism .",
    "therefore we can consider situations where @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the characteristic kk mass , @xmath58 is characteristic moduli mass that can be taken to be arbitrarily large and @xmath17 is the hubble factor during inflation .",
    "this permits an effectively 4d description of the background over which kk modes with masses up to @xmath59 can be excited . before deriving our desired results",
    ", it is useful to have an overview of the different moving parts at work :    * cavendish experiments fix @xmath0 to be @xmath60 gev up to the percent level at scales @xmath61 m @xmath62 ev@xmath63 @xcite .",
    "* for each mass threshold crossed between @xmath64 ev up to the scale of inflation , the strength of gravity increases as per ( [ mple ] ) , after which the usual logarithmic running sets in . * the species that contribute depend on the process considered , but always include kk gravitons , consistently treated as massive spin-2 excitations over a 4d solution since @xmath65 .    in order to illustrate the physics at work in as simple a context as possible",
    ", we further make the assumptions that :    * we either have one extra dimension , so that aside from the zero modes , there are no extra graviscalars / vectors other than those ` eaten ' by the massive spin-2 kk modes ; * or for more than one extra dimension , the mechanism that gives masses to the zero modes of the radion and vector moduli also generates commensurate masses for their kk excitations .    the latter two conditions can readily be relaxed , although for the purposes of simple illustration ensure through ( [ mkkc ] ) that the scalar and vector fluctuation modes of the extra dimensions have masses much larger than @xmath17 thus permitting an effective 4d description for the perturbations with no other hidden scalars . for more than one extra dimension ,",
    "relaxing the latter requirement would result in additional light universally coupled hidden fields which still require a mechanism to generate masses for them to avoid fifth force constraints .",
    "species of the former alone would fix @xmath66 all the way up to @xmath67 , logarithmic running aside ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . within this context , see also @xcite where additional fields and interactions typically generate non - gaussianities . ]      in summary , we see that although the amplitude and spectral properties of cmb anisotropies are unaffected by any difference in the strength of gravity during inflation , _ inferring _ an absolute scale is complicated by our lack of knowledge of the scale @xmath118 and and @xmath1 , rendering it effectively uncertain .",
    "we further note that since the tilt of the power spectrum of all of the individual graviton polarizations is still fixed by the deviation of the background from an exactly ds geometry @xmath119 , we see that ( [ rfix ] ) implies a deviation from the tensor to scalar consistency relation : @xmath120 which is the only _ observable _ consequence of the process and scale dependence of the strength of gravity at the scale of inflation .",
    "recently several concerns regarding some of the results discussed above were raised in @xcite which we presently wish to address .",
    "firstly , it was observed that the higuchi bound nominally appears to forbid the presence of massive spin-2 excitations over a ds background within the mass range @xmath121 which would imply that kk resonances could not be excited during inflation under the circumstances described in the previous subsection and correspondingly affect the inferred scale of inflation .",
    "however if such a bound were to truly apply to kk gravitons , one would have a no - go theorem for compactifications that would forbid consistent solutions to higher dimensional einstein gravity with an effective 4d hubble scale that is greater than the compactification scale .",
    "no such no - go theorem exists .",
    "we demonstrate this by explicit example in appendix a , where we construct a solution to 5d einstein gravity on an orbifold topology with an empty bulk and bounding branes of opposite tensions that support an induced 4d ds geometry : @xmath122 where @xmath123 with @xmath124 being the tensions of the brane at @xmath125 and @xmath126 respectively with @xmath127 taken to be negative so that one has an expanding induced ds solution , with the two tensions related by the junction conditions at @xmath126 as @xmath128 . by adjusting @xmath129 , one",
    "can thus keep the induced hubble factor fixed whilst simultaneously dialing the physical inter - brane separation to be as large as one desires @xmath130 hence in keeping @xmath131 fixed , our solution consistently attains @xmath132 , and given that the kk mass spectrum scales up to pre - factors of order unity as @xmath133 we find an explicit construction where the masses of an arbitrary but finite number of kk modes can be made less than the hubble scale . in appendix",
    "b we understand precisely how kk gravitons _ evade _ higuchi s bound in this context .",
    "the reason for this is straightforward and has to do with the fact that compactifications necessarily spontaneously break higher dimensional lorentz invariance . as a result ,",
    "background sources contribute terms that precisely cancel what would have been problematic terms in the equation of motion for the massive spin-2 graviton , as could have been inferred from the outset by the healthiness of higher dimensional einstein gravity .",
    "furthermore , it was argued in @xcite that lower spin particles could not affect the observed spectrum of tensor perturbations since the latter can only be generated from the einstein hilbert term in the effective action : @xmath134 this statement is inaccurate , as taking the above as the only source of tt petrurbations leads to the contradiction that it would be possible to infer a scale for inflation beyond where a classical description of geometry breaks down ( [ mc ] ) .",
    "focussing presently on a strictly 4d context for clarity of discussion , one needs only to realize that in fact it is not ( [ ttact ] ) , but the effective action is the inflaton that sources the background evolution . ]",
    "@xmath135 that one has to work with in extracting the tensor power spectrum where as reviewed in the previous section , @xmath29 are spin dependent weighted indices that count the _ total _ number of massive species of all spins present and where the ellipses denote higher order terms in the curvature and loop expansion ( with each independent loop momenta contributing a factor of @xmath5 ) . on a given background ,",
    "the resulting quadratic action for the tt polarizations of the graviton is given by @xmath136\\left(1 + c\\frac{h_*^2}{{m_{\\rm pl}}^2 } + ... \\right)\\ ] ] where the correction term is obtained from the last two terms in ( [ 1li ] ) with two derivatives acting on the background derivative term in the effective action to the graviton propagator denoted by ellipses are proportional to @xmath137 . ] .",
    "this expansion breaks down precisely when @xmath138 implying the bound ( [ hbound ] ) that the scale of inflation can not be greater than the strong coupling scale @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , as seen in the previous section , lower spin species that couple to the trace of the energy momentum tensor do indeed affect the spectrum of tensor and curvature perturbations in such a way that the usual single field tensor to scalar consistency relation is violated ( [ csv ] ) due to the process dependence of @xmath0 .",
    "in this note , we have elaborated upon various consequences of the fact that characteristic strength of gravity at a given energy ( @xmath0 ) and its strong coupling scale ( @xmath1 ) are in general different from each other and the macroscopically determined @xmath2 , particularly as they relate to inferring absolute scales from cosmological observations .",
    "this is because universally coupled species ( defined as all particles that can mediate _ tree level _ interactions between conserved sources ) affect the strength of gravity at distances smaller than their compton wavelength .",
    "moreover , all species present ( universally coupled , hidden or otherwise ) drag down the strong coupling scale  where a classical description of geometry breaks down  as @xmath139 , where @xmath5 is the total number of species .",
    "this necessarily bounds the scale of inflation from above . as stressed , although observables are dimensionless ratios of quantities measured at a fixed scale and thus independent of the units in which they are expressed , inferring an absolute scale for inflation from any detection of primordial tensors is complicated by the fact that we simply do not know @xmath0 and @xmath1 during inflation . along the way",
    ", we made an observation of possible wider interest , namely that kk gravitons necessarily evade the higuchi bound on any consistent compactification of higher dimensional einstein gravity  a result guaranteed by the healthiness of the einstein - hilbert action in any number of dimensions .",
    "we understand why this is so in the appendices .",
    "sp is supported by funds from the swiss national science foundation .",
    "consider small perturbations around the background metric ( [ 5ddec ] ) : @xmath176 the perturbed einstein equations in 5d are given by @xmath177 in what follows , we will need the non - vanishing components of the ricci and riemann tensors ( greek indices run from 0 to 3 ) : @xmath178 @xmath179 @xmath180 @xmath181 that is , the metric ( [ 5ddec ] ) is flat everywhere except at the branes .",
    "furthermore , we realize that we can exploit 5d diffeomorphism invariance to work in the gauge @xmath182 which corresponds to the usual 5d de donder gauge , further exploiting the residual gauge symmetry to fix @xmath183 and @xmath184 .",
    "we find that with this gauge choice , the @xmath185 component of ( [ mgf ] ) implies @xmath186 however , given the boundary conditions on the brane tensions @xmath187 ( [ brel ] ) , we see that the relation ( [ hans ] ) enforces a cancellation for the mass terms for @xmath188 sourced by the background , leaving us with @xmath189 furthermore , the @xmath190 component of ( [ mgf ] ) can be shown to imply @xmath191 leaving us with the equation of motion that is absent from any explicit source terms from the background geometry : @xmath192 expanding @xmath188 in terms of kk eigenmodes @xmath193 and integrating over the extra dimension @xcite , we will reproduce the equations of motion for each spin-2 kk resonance @xmath194 where @xmath195 is the dalembertian on a 4d ds background and where @xmath196 is the corresponding eigenvalue . since it was explicit background sources that resulted in @xmath197 obtaining negative norm states for a certain mass range in @xcite , we see that such terms simply do not arise in our set - up .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the fact that the compactification spontaneously breaks 5d lorentz invariance , resulting in extra sources that cancel contributions from the background geometry that would have otherwise been problematic .",
    "hence there are no propagating ghosts and higuchi s bound is evaded , as should have been obvious from the outset due to the intrinsic healthiness of higher dimensional einstein gravity .",
    "the general lesson that this exercise is illustrative of is that there is no one generally applicable higuchi bound , merely a given set of stability conditions to be evaluated on a case by case ( theory by theory ) basis , and that for some theories , these conditions are trivially satisfied as is evidently the case for the manifestly healthy higher dimensional einstein gravity .",
