    "* guzzo 2014 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* garilli 2014 ) ) is targeting 100k galaxies with spectroscopy at redshifts z=0.5 to 1.2 .",
    "with complementary photometric coverage from uv to ir and morphological measures from cfhtls , this unique dataset is providing unprecedented detail on the properties of galaxies and the formation of structure at intermediate redshifts .",
    "we examine the correlations across the parameter space of observable and derived properties with special focus on spatial clustering .",
    "we adopt a volume limited sample at @xmath0 with luminosity cut @xmath1 giving 15 494 galaxies .",
    "we consider the following set of 12 parameters : ( 1 ) : stellar mass ; ( 2 ) : rest - frame spectral slope in blue ; ( 3 ) : rest - frame v magnitude ; ( 4 ) : pca 1 spectral index ; ( 5 ) : balmer break depth ; ( 6 ) : oii line equivalent width ; ( 7 ) : oii line apparent flux ; ( 8) : rest - frame spectral slope in red ; ( 9 ) : pca 2 spectral index ; ( 10 ) : sersic morphological index ; ( 11 ) : clustering slope at @xmath2 ; ( 12 ) : clustering amplitude at @xmath3 .    the spectral principal component analysis is described in @xcite ; the derivations of the rest - frame galaxy properties and stellar mass are given in @xcite and @xcite ; spectral line measurements are described in @xcite ; the spatial clustering properties are described in @xcite and @xcite ; the galaxy morphologies are measured in krywult ( in preparation ) .",
    "these parameters represent diverse quantities with different units . to measure separations between points in parameter space",
    ", we first apply a gaussianisation transform to the distributions .",
    "we group the galaxies by properties to further reduce the dimensionality of the dataset .",
    "we apply the k - means group - finding algorithm to determine 100 group centres .",
    "this algorithm partitions the space into subgroups with approximately equal size .",
    "the projected correlation function of each subgroup is measured to derive the @xmath4 and @xmath5 parameters .",
    "the @xmath4 and @xmath5 values are then assigned to individual galaxies by extrapolating between the group centres . what is the underlying dimensionality of the dataset ?",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : dim ] that a single parameter such as stellar mass can explain the primary trends .    .",

    "the bimodal nature of galaxies is reflected in most of the properties considered .",
    "most striking is the clustering amplitude @xmath5 that characterises how galaxies are distributed over the density field .",
    "considering the two locii of galaxies , the reddest , luminous and massive group is also highly clustered signifying dense environments , while the bluer galaxies are more uniformly distributed and show weaker clustering slopes @xmath4 .    to investigate the factors that influence the galaxy properties we subtract the median trend with @xmath6 from each parameter ( not shown here ) .",
    "once removed , the correlations are greatly reduced .",
    "in particular , correlations with @xmath8 are reduced since @xmath8 is degenerate with stellar mass . however , we find that colour parameters @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 remain strongly correlated and still relate to clustering .",
    "stellar mass is a major driver of galaxy properties , but it can not explain everything . after subtracting trends with stellar mass ,",
    "residual correlations exist reinforcing the conclusion that environment must play an important role .",
    "this is highlighted by the dependencies seen in the correlation function since the clustering properties may be related directly to how galaxies are distributed within underlying dark matter clumps .",
    "we see that the dependencies on galaxy properties are complex as they encode the subtle mechanisms relating the formation of galaxies to the large - scale density field .",
    "parameter emerges as one of the most informative parameters .",
    "the panels show the joint distributions of parameters coloured by clustering amplitude a. the contours contain 50% and 90% of galaxies .",
    "orange dashed line gives the trend with stellar mass while blue dashed line gives the trend with @xmath8 showing that mass and luminosity can account for the primary trends.,width=432 ]    we acknowledge the eso staff for the management of service observations .",
