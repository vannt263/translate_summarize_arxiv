    "in recent years , magnetic fields of various strength and topology have been detected in increasing number of stars ( see , e.g. , donati et al . 2006 ) . despite the origin of stellar magnetic fields",
    "is usually related to the turbulent dynamo action in convection zones , it is quite possible that magnetic fields exist also in internal radiation zones as well .",
    "for instance , a uniform rotation of the solar core may be explained naturally by the presence of the magnetic field . a thin transition layer between the convection and radiation zones of the sun , called the tachocline , can not be understood within the frame of purely fluid - dynamical mechanisms and requires a large - scale magnetic field in the sun s interior ( gough & mcintyre 1998 ) .",
    "the origin , topology , and strength of the magnetic field in internal radiation zones are the subject of debates for decades .",
    "likely , dynamo can not operate in stellar radiation zones .",
    "a dynamo action requires sufficiently rapid flows with re@xmath0 ( re@xmath1 is the magnetic reynolds number ) to generate a global magnetic field but , according to the generally accepted point of view , such flows are not available in the internal radiation zones ( see , e.g. , schwarzschild 1958 ) .",
    "sometimes , the origin of the magnetic field in radiation zones is related to the dynamo mechanism proposed by spruit ( 1999 ) but the existence of such mechanism has not be proven yet .",
    "one might speculate that a fossil magnetic field could exist in radiation zones .",
    "even a weak fossil field with non - vanishing poloidal component will quickly wrap up into a predominantly toroidal configuration , under the action of differential rotation .",
    "such configurations can be generated if re@xmath1 of differential rotation is greater than 1 , or @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the angular velocity and magnetic diffusivity , respectively .",
    "estimating @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a departure from the rigid rotation and assuming that the conductivity of plasma is @xmath7 s@xmath8 , one can obtain that this condition is satisfied if @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the angular velocity in inverse seconds .",
    "therefore , even very weak departures from the rigid rotation lead to a generation of the toroidal field .",
    "the magnetic field with a predominant toroidal component is also typical for the liquid cores of neutron stars ( bonanno et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 ) where the field can be generated by the turbulent dynamo during the very early evolutionary stage .",
    "the toroidal field resulting from winding up or dynamo action can not be arbitrarily strong because various magnetic instabilities will set in when it becomes strong enough .",
    "that is why much attention has been drawn to the instabilities that may affect the toroidal magnetic field in stably stratified radiation zones .",
    "the magnetic field in a radiation zone can be subject to various instabilities such as the magnetic buoyancy ( see , e.g. , gilman 1970 , acheson 1978 ) or magnetorotational instability ( velikhov 1959 , balbus 1995 ) .",
    "likely , however , that the most efficient instabilities are caused by the electric currents maintaining the magnetic configuration ( spruit 1999 ) .",
    "such instabilities are well studied in cylindrical geometry in the context of laboratory fusion research ( see , e.g. , freidberg 1970 , goedbloed & hagebeuk 1972 ) . in astrophysical conditions , the instability caused by electric currents is studied mainly in cylindrical geometry as well ( see , e.g. , tayler 1973 ) .",
    "it turns out that the properties of instability depend on the ratio of the axial and toroidal fields and , even if this ratio is small , the axial field can alter the instability substantially ( see , e.g. , knobloch 1992 , bonanno & urpin 2008a ) . the effect of an axial field on the tayler instability of the toroidal field has been studied in detail in cylindrical geometry by bonanno & urpin ( 2008b , 2011 ) .",
    "the nonlinear evolution of the tayler instability was considered by bonanno et al .",
    "( 2012 ) who argued that symmetry - breaking can give rise to a saturated state with non - zero helicity even if the initial state has zero helicity .",
    "a production of non - zero helicity is likely possibility for the onset of adynamo action .",
    "stability of the spherical magnetic configurations is much less studied because of mathematical problems . with numerical simulations braithwaite & nordlund ( 2006 ) studied the stability of a random initial field and argued that this field relaxes on a stable mixed magnetic configuration with both poloidal and toroidal components .",
    "stability of magnetic configurations with a predominantly toroidal field draws a particular attention .",
    "numerical modeling by braithwaite ( 2006 ) confirmed that the toroidal field with @xmath11 or @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is the cylindrical radius ) is unstable to the @xmath14 mode as it was predicted by tayler ( 1973 ) .",
    "it is widely believed that rotation and stratification can play an important role in stellar radiation zones providing a stabilizing influence on the tayler instability ( see , e.g. , pitts & tayler 1985 , spruit 1999 ) .",
    "recently , the effect of stratification and thermal conductivity on the tayler instability of the toroidal field has been considered by bonanno & urpin ( 2012 ) .",
    "the authors studied a linear stability and used a local approximation in latitude and global in the radial direction .",
    "they calculated the growth rate of instability and argued that the combined influence of gravity and thermal conductivity can never suppress the instability entirely .",
    "stratification suppresses the instability at the pole more efficiently than at the equator .",
    "the growth rate of instability can be essentially reduced by a stable stratification .",
    "a decrease of the growth rate caused by stratification is inversely proportional to the brunt - visl frequency .",
    "therefore , if gravity is strong , the instability developes very slowly . a simple fitting expression has been obtained for the growth rate of instability in a stratified radiation zone .",
    "bonanno & urpin ( 2012 ) argued that the instability of modes with a large number of nodes in the radial direction is significantly more suppressed than the fundamental eigenmode .",
    "the reason of this is qualitatively clear .",
    "as it was pointed out by spruit ( 1999 ) , the stabilizing influence of stratification is less pronounced for perturbations with short radial lengthscales .",
    "therefore , it seems at the first glance that the instability should operate most efficiently on very short radial lengthscales .",
    "however , this conclusion is incorrect because a destabilizing effect of electric currents ( that is the reason of the tayler instability ) also decreases if the radial lengthscale decreases .",
    "this occurs because the instability becomes almost two - dimensional if the radial lengthscale goes to 0 but , as it was shown by kitchatinov & rdiger ( 2008 ) , the tayler instability does not exist in 2d .",
    "therefore , the instability can not arise for perturbations with very short radial lengthscales despite the stabilizing influence of stratification is minimal for them .",
    "rotation can also suppress the tayler instability and stabilize the magnetic configurations .",
    "the effect of rotation has been considered by a number of authors .",
    "spruit ( 1999 ) found that the growth rate of the tayler instability near the rotation axis should be of the order of @xmath15 if @xmath16 in a particular case of the magnetic field dependent on @xmath13 alone , where @xmath17 and @xmath3 are the alfven frequency and angular velocity of the star , respectively . in numerical modelling by braithwaite ( 2006 ) , the tayler instability was suppressed if @xmath3 is above a certain value of the order of @xmath17 . above this value a distinct oscillatory behaviour sets in with marginal stability .",
    "stability of the toroidal field in rotating radiation zones has been considered also by kitchatinov ( 2008 ) and kitchatinov & rdiger ( 2008 ) who clarified that the tayler s instability recovers only in 3d .",
    "radial displacements are essential for this instability",
    ". it does not exist in the 2d case of strictly horizontal ( perpendicular to gravity ) disturbances and only stable modes exist in this case .",
    "these authors argued that the magnetic instability is characterized by the threshold field strength .",
    "the instability arises if the magnetic field is stronger than this threshold but it does not occur if the field is weaker than the threshold .",
    "estimating this threshold in the solar radiation zone , kitchatinov & rdiger ( 2008 ) impose the upper limit on the magnetic field @xmath18 g. the stability of the toroidal field in a rotating radiation zone has been studied also by zahn et al .",
    "( 2007 ) in the particular case @xmath19 .",
    "the particular type of oscillatory modes found by these authors is relevant to rotation and is stable in the non - dissipative limit .",
    "however , instability of the considered modes can occur in a form of an oscillatory diffusive instability if dissipation is provided by radiative or ohmic diffusion .",
    "unfortunately , the authors of these studies did not compare the results of their calculations and the reason of such qualitatively different behaviours is unclear .    in this paper",
    ", we consider in detail the effect of rotational suppression of the tayler instability in the case of a predominantly toroidal field .",
    "we show that rotation can influence the instability in different ways depending on the baseground magnetic configuration .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the basic equations and mathematical formulation of the problem are presented in sec.2 .",
    "this is followed by results of numerical calculations of the growth rate and frequency of unstable modes in sec.3 .",
    "the paper closes with a summary of the main results and some remarks in sec.4 .",
    "we assume that the magnetic field in a radiation zone is subthermal and the magnetic pressure is smaller than the gas pressure . in this case",
    ", the boussinesq approximation is applied for a consideration of low - frequency modes .",
    "the ideal mhd equations read in this approximation @xmath20",
    "@xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 is gravity , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the gas pressure and density , respectively .",
    "the equation of thermal balance reads in the boussinesq approximation @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the adiabatic temperature gradient .",
    "consider the stability of an axisymmetric toroidal magnetic field using spherical coordinates ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) .",
    "we assume that the radiation zone rotates with the angular velocity @xmath31=const and that the toroidal field depends on @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath32 . in the unperturbed state",
    ", the radiation zone is assumed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium , then @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the unit vector in the cylindrical radial direction .",
    "the rotational energy is assumed to be much smaller than the gravitational one , @xmath35 . since the magnetic energy is subthermal",
    ", @xmath23 is approximately radial in our basic state .",
    "therefore , longitudinal variations of the unperturbed density and pressure are small .",
    "we consider a linear stability .",
    "small perturbations will be indicated by subscript 1 , while unperturbed quantities will have no subscript . linearizing eqs.(1)-(4 ) , we take into account that small perturbations of the density and temperature in the boussinesq approximation are related by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the thermal expansion coefficient .",
    "we use a local approximation in the @xmath29-direction and assume that small perturbations depend on @xmath29 as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the polar wavenumber . since the basic state is stationary and axisymmetric , the dependence of perturbations on @xmath40 and @xmath30 can be taken in the exponential form as well .",
    "then , perturbations are proportional to @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the azimuthal wavenumber and @xmath43 is the growth rate . the dependence of perturbations on @xmath28 should be determined from eqs.(1)-(4 ) .    since the influence of gravity on instability has been studied in detail by bonanno & urpin ( 2012 ) , we concentrate in this paper mainly on the effect of rotation .",
    "we consider a simplified problem assuming that stratification is neutral and @xmath44 . in this case",
    ", the stabilizing effect of stratification is excluded and we can study only the influence of rotation alone . the combined influence of rotation and stratification will be considered elsewhere . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we also assume that the unperturbed density is approximately homogeneous in the radiation zone .    eliminating all variables in favor of @xmath45",
    ", we obtain with the accuracy in terms of the lowest order in @xmath46 @xmath47 v_{1r } = 0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath28 and @xmath48 the polar and azimuthal wavevectors are @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "this equation with the corresponding boundary conditions describes the stability problem as a non - linear eigenvalue problem .",
    "fortunately , the main qualitative features of this problem are not sensitive to the choice of boundary conditions .",
    "that is why we choose the simplest boundary conditions and assume that @xmath51 at the inner and outer boundaries , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "we assume that the radiation zone is located at @xmath54 or , introducing the dimensionless radius @xmath55 , at @xmath56 where @xmath57 .",
    "we choose the internal radius of the radiation zone , @xmath58 , to be small but finite for computational convenience .",
    "in particular @xmath59 in this investigation .",
    "our results do not depend qualitatively on the precise value of @xmath58 , as we have explicitly verified by performing calculations with with @xmath58 in the range @xmath60 ( less than @xmath61 difference in the growth rate for @xmath59 and @xmath62 for @xmath63 for instance ) .",
    "we represent the toroidal field as @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the field strength at @xmath66 at the equator .",
    "the dependence of @xmath67 on @xmath28 is uncertain in the radiation zone .",
    "therefore , we consider different possibilities , varying the parameter @xmath68 . the radial dependence in eq.(8 ) is the simplest one and convenient from the computational point of view .",
    "a power law dependence on the cylindrical radius was also used , for example , in the pioneering paper by tayler ( 1973 ) and , therefore , it is more convenient to compare the results for spherical and cylindrical geometries , choosing the dependence ( 8) .",
    "eq.(8 ) can mimic various physical situations .",
    "the case @xmath69 , for instance , can be a representative of the radiation zone in a star with the outer convective zone .",
    "on the contrary , the case @xmath70 can mimic a radiation zone with the magnetic field generated in the inner convective core . certainly , the magnetic field in a radiation zone can have a more complicated dependence than eq.(8 ) but the main qualitative features can be understood from this simple model .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the dimensionless quantities @xmath71 where @xmath72 .",
    "we will represent the results in terms of @xmath73 and @xmath74 .    in fig .  1 , we plot the growth rate and frequency of unstable modes as functions of @xmath74 for different @xmath29 and @xmath75 .",
    "such distribution of @xmath67 can mimic , for example , the radiation zone of a star with a convective envelope . in this case",
    ", the bottom of a convection zone is likely the location of the toroidal field generated by a dynamo action .",
    "however , this case can be also the representative of a star with relic magnetic fields .",
    "details of the formation of such fields are very uncertain but it is quite possible that differential rotation is stronger in the outer layers at the early stage of stellar evolution .",
    "then , the toroidal field generated by differential rotation should be stronger in the outer layers as well .",
    "1 shows that the instability is most efficient at the equator and does not occur around the pole .",
    "there always exist a range of @xmath29 around the pole where the instability does not occur and this range depends on @xmath68 .",
    "note that the instability exhibits a similar behaviour also in the non - rotating case ( see bonanno & urpin 2012 ) .",
    "our result is at variance with a widely accepted opinion that toroidal magnetic configurations are always unstable at the axis ( see , e.g. , spruit 1999 ) .",
    "this opinion is based on similarity of the spherical magnetic configuration near the axis and the axisymmetric cylindrical configuration . however , this analogy is generally incorrect because , in spherical geometry , the toroidal field near the axis depends also on distance along the magnetic axis and not only on the distance from it",
    ". this dependence plays the crucial role in stability . at small @xmath74 ,",
    "the maximum growth rate is of the order of @xmath76 and is reached at the equator .",
    "however , the growth rate clearly shows some suppression for a faster rotation .",
    "suppression becomes important already at relatively small values of @xmath77 .",
    "we can distinguish two substantially different regimes of suppression .",
    "if @xmath29 is greater than some characteristic value , @xmath78 , the growth rate decreases with an increase of @xmath74 approximately as @xmath79 and it does not vanish even at very large @xmath74 .",
    "it turns out , therefore , that rotation can never suppress the tayler instability in the region around the equator , where @xmath80 , but can only decrease its growth rate .",
    "note that the tayler s modes are complex in this region in contrast to the non - rotating case .",
    "the frequency (= i m @xmath73 ) is basically comparable to the growth rate and also decreases if rotation becomes faster .",
    "note also that similar dependence of the growth rate on @xmath74 was obtained by spruit ( 1999 ) who considered the instability in cylindrical geometry with the toroidal field dependent on the cylindrical radius alone , @xmath81 where @xmath13 is the cylindrical radius .",
    "the exact value of @xmath78 is rather difficult to calculate because of computational problems but , in the case @xmath75 , it is equal approximately to @xmath82 . for @xmath83 ,",
    "the effect of rotation is substantially stronger .",
    "in contrast to the instability near the equator , the instability at @xmath84 is characterized by the threshold , @xmath85 .",
    "the instability occurs if @xmath86 ( re @xmath87 in this region ) but it does not occur if @xmath88 since @xmath73 is imaginary at such @xmath74 .",
    "the threshold , @xmath85 , depends on @xmath29 and is @xmath89 if @xmath90 .",
    "the threshold value @xmath85 is lower for smaller @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , even a relatively slow rotation with @xmath91 can suppress the instability entirely in some region around the pole .",
    "note that the tayler modes become oscillatory beyond the threshold ( at @xmath88 ) : their growth rate is equal to zero but the frequency is always non - vanishing . in the region around the pole ( at @xmath92 ) ,",
    "the instability does not arise even if rotation is very slow ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "the critical value of the polar angle , @xmath94 , that restricts the stable region for a non - rotating star , is @xmath95 .     for @xmath75 and for @xmath96 ( solid )",
    ", @xmath97 ( dashed ) , @xmath98 ( dash - and - dotted ) , @xmath99 ( dash - dot - dotted ) , and @xmath100 ( dotted ) . the longitudinal wavenumber is @xmath101.,width=340 ]    in fig .  2 , we plot the growth rate and frequency for the case @xmath102 .",
    "qualitatively , the behaviour is same but suppression turns out to be more essential .",
    "again , the instability is most efficient at the equator and does not occur around the pole .",
    "this is qualitatively clear because , on the equator , with a neutral entropy gradient , we have an equivalent situation to the cylindrical geometry .",
    "the growth rate is maximal for small @xmath74 and is @xmath103 at the equator that is a bit lower than in the case @xmath75 .",
    "rotational suppression becomes important already at @xmath104 and can operate in two different regimes , depending on @xmath29 .",
    "the characteristic value @xmath78 that distinguishes these two regimes is @xmath105 in this case .",
    "unfortunately , we can not calculate the growth rate when both @xmath29 and @xmath74 are close to their critical values , @xmath106 and @xmath85 , respectively .",
    "this is caused by computational problems . at @xmath80 ,",
    "the growth rate decreases with an increase of @xmath74 approximately as @xmath79 and it does not vanish at large @xmath74 .",
    "rotation can never suppress the instability in this region of @xmath29 but can only reduce its growth rate . like the case @xmath107 , unstable modes are oscillatory in this region with the frequency being comparable to the growth rate .",
    "closer to the pole , at @xmath84 , the instability is characterized by the threshold , @xmath85 : the instability can occur if @xmath108 but it is suppressed if @xmath88 .",
    "for example , at @xmath109 , the critical value @xmath85 is @xmath110 but it is lower for smaller @xmath29 . in the region near the pole , @xmath111 , the instability is completely suppressed and does not occur at any @xmath74 .",
    "however , there exist stable oscillatory modes with a low frequency .     for @xmath112 and for @xmath96 ( solid )",
    ", @xmath113 ( dashed ) , @xmath114 ( dash - and - dotted ) , @xmath82 ( dotted ) , and @xmath115 ( thick solid ) . the longitudinal wavenumber is @xmath101.,width=340 ]    fig .",
    "3 plots the growth rate and frequency for the toroidal field with @xmath116 . like the previous cases ,",
    "the instability is most efficient at the equator and its growth rate decreases if @xmath29 decreases . generally , the instability at @xmath116 is suppressed stronger than in the cases @xmath75 and @xmath112 .",
    "however , there is a qualitative difference in comparison to these cases : there is no regime near the equator in which the growth rate is non - vanishing at large @xmath74 or , in other words , @xmath117 .",
    "it turns out that such regime of instability can occur only at a relatively large @xmath68 .",
    "the instability at @xmath116 is characterized by the threshold , @xmath85 , even in the region near the equator . the threshold is lower than for @xmath112 and is equal to @xmath118 at the equator . as usual , the threshold is lower for smaller @xmath29 .",
    "the field near the magnetic axis turns out to be stable .",
    "the instability does not occur at any @xmath74 in the region with @xmath119 .",
    "the condition of stability @xmath88 can easily be reformulated in terms of the angular velocity and magnetic field .",
    "rotation suppresses completely the tayler instability if the star rotates with the angular velocity @xmath120 we can also rewrite this inequality as the condition for the magnetic field , @xmath121    the tayler modes become oscillatory ( i m @xmath122 ) if condition ( 10 ) or ( 11 ) are satisfied .",
    "note that such behaviour was also seen in numerical modelling of the tayler instability by braithwaite ( 2006 ) .",
    "the frequency of marginally stable waves is of the order of @xmath123 at @xmath124 and it decreases @xmath125 at large @xmath74 .",
    "this new type of magnetohydrodynamic waves is determined by the coriolis and lorentz force and can exist at those values of @xmath74 which suppress the tayler instability .",
    "the dispersion relation for these waves can easily be obtained from eq.(6 ) in short wavelength approximation .",
    "consider perturbations with a very short radial wavelength for which one can use a local approximation in the radial direction , such as @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is the radial wavevector .",
    "if @xmath128 , then eq.(6 ) yields with the accuracy in terms of the lowest order in @xmath129 the following dispersion equation @xmath130 or @xmath131 the solution of this equation is @xmath132 if @xmath133 then we can expand a square root in a power series of @xmath134 .",
    "then , choosing the upper sign in eq.(14 ) , we obtain with accuracy in the lowest order in @xmath134 @xmath135 this dispersion relation describes a new type of oscillatory modes that can exist in rapidly rotating stars .",

    "the threshould value of @xmath74 at the equator is @xmath118 .",

    "we have considered the stability of the toroidal field in rotating stellar radiation zones .",
    "stability properties of the spherical magnetic configurations are generally qualitatively different from those of the cylindrical configurations .",
    "for instance , our calculations show that the instability is most efficient near the equator but the toroidal field can be stable near the symmetry axis .",
    "this is in the contrast to a widely accepted opinion based on the analysis of cylindrical configurations ( see , e.g. , spruit 1999 , zhang et al .",
    "2003 ) that the toroidal field is always unstable near the axis in the spherical geometry .",
    "however , a direct analogy between stability of an infinitely long cylinder with the azimuthal field and the toroidal field in stellar radiation zones is generally misleading . in order to apply the cylindrical geometry near the axis of a spherical star , one needs to make sure that i ) the length scale of perturbations in the axial direction is small compared to the radius and ii ) the radial ( cylindrical ) length scale of perturbations is small compared to the radius .",
    "it is clear that perturbations should be affected by the spherical geometry if their radial length scale is comparable to the stellar radius .",
    "therefore , the behaviour of such modes with a large radial length scale may be different in the spherical and cylindrical geometries .",
    "as far as perturbations with a small radial length scale are concerned , they are alway stable ( see eq.(14)-(15 ) ) .",
    "therefore , the analogy with an infinitely long cylinder is generally incorrect and the tayler instability can be suppressed near the magnetic axis in the spherical geometry .",
    "it seems that a dependence on the axial coordinate always makes perturbations more stable .",
    "rotation provides an additional stabilizing influence on the tayler instability .",
    "the effect of rotation is characterized by the parameter @xmath151 that can be large in radiation zones * ( @xmath152 if @xmath153 g)*. a reduction of the growth rate becomes significant already at a relatively low angular velocity , @xmath154 , that corresponds to @xmath104 .",
    "it turns out that the effect of rotation can be twofold and depends crucially on the radial dependence of the toroidal field .",
    "if the toroidal field increases with the spherical radius sufficiently rapidly ( @xmath155 ) then rotation can not suppress completely the tayler instability in the region around the equator , even if @xmath74 is very large .",
    "this region is more extended for larger @xmath68 but shrinks around the equator and disappear for smaller @xmath68 .",
    "the growth rate of instability in this region is non - vanishing for any angular velocity but it can be substantially reduced at large @xmath74 . at large @xmath74 , the growth rate descreases @xmath156 and",
    "is approximately equal to @xmath157 .",
    "this expression was also obtained by spruit ( 1999 ) for the growth rate near the rotation axis in a particular case @xmath81 .",
    "note , however , that the alfven timescale , @xmath158 , is typically short ( @xmath159 yrs if @xmath160 g ) compared to the stellar life - time , therefore even a suppressed instability with a reduced growth rate can be important in radiation zones .",
    "such region near the equator exists only if @xmath68 is sufficiently large ( @xmath161 ) but it shrinks and disappears if @xmath68 decreases . at smaller @xmath29 , the region is located where the rotational suppression is qualitatively different and where the instability is determined by the threshold value of @xmath74 .",
    "the tayler instability turns out to be suppressed completely in this region if @xmath162 .",
    "therefore , modes are stable everywhere in this region for such rapidly rotating stars .",
    "the threshold is not very high and corresponds approximately to @xmath154 .",
    "higher eigenmodes are suppressed stronger than the fundamental one and perturbations with a short radial wavelength are always stable .",
    "since the instability is suppressed at @xmath88 but not suppressed at @xmath108 , this implies that the magnetic field should satisfy the condition @xmath163 in order the instability could occur . estimating @xmath164 cm / s and @xmath165 g/@xmath166",
    ", we obtain that instability can arise in the radiation zone of the sun if @xmath167 g. this estimate of the critical field is more than two orders of magnitude higher than that obtained by kichatinov & rdiger ( 2008 ) .",
    "the hydrodynamic motions generated by instability can be important for the transport processes in radiation zones .",
    "motions in the unstable modes depend generally on the polar and azimuthal wavenumbers as well as on the parameter @xmath74 . in real conditions , @xmath74 is likely large ( @xmath168 ) and the radial length scale of eigenmodes is rather short . if it is shorter than @xmath169 or @xmath170 , then one can easily estimate from the continuity equation that the radial component of velocity is small compared to the polar and azimuthal ones",
    ". however , the character of motions can be different at the non - linear stage when the interaction between modes becomes essential .",
    "it turns out that a new type of magneto - inertial waves might exist in the radiation zones of rapidly rotating stars in the regions where @xmath88 and the tayler instability is suppressed .",
    "these waves are marginally stable and their dispersion relation is given by eq.(15 ) at large @xmath74 .",
    "the frequency of this oscillation decreases with an increase of @xmath3 .",
    "these waves are stable in our simplified model but they can be unstable in more realistic conditions ( the presence of a poloidal field , differential rotation , etc . ) .",
    "the magneto - inertial waves can play an important in various processes in the radiation zone ( mixing , transport of the angular momentum , formation of the tachocline , etc . ) .",
    "these waves will be considered in more detail in a subsequent publication .    _",
