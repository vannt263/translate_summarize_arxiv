    "it is sometimes argued that the quantum - mechanical description of the microcanonical distribution is simpler than the corresponding classical counterpart  @xcite .",
    "this is because the standard quantum microcanonical postulate asserts that if the energy of the system lies in the range @xmath0 to @xmath1 , then all of the energy eigenstates with energy @xmath2 $ ] are realised with equal probability  @xcite .",
    "while such a postulate does indeed provide an elementary statistical description of the quantum system in terms of a uniform probability distribution , it is not clear how this postulate ties in with other fundamental ideas in quantum mechanics .",
    "for example , in quantum mechanics the state of the system can be represented by a general superposition of energy eigenstates , whereas according to the standard quantum microcanonical postulate , superpositions of energy eigenstates with distinct eigenvalues are excluded .",
    "also , if an energy eigenvalue that lies in the interval @xmath3 $ ] is nondegenerate , then the standard postulate implies that the system can only be in a single eigenstate corresponding to that eigenvalue .",
    "these observations suggest that the standard postulate is perhaps too stringent to give rise to a satisfactory statistical description of a quantum system in isolation .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to study the consequences of a relaxation of the standard quantum microcanonical postulate .",
    "specifically , we consider the following generalisation of the microcanonical postulate : namely , that every quantum state possessing the same energy expectation value must be realised with an equal probability . according to this ` weaker '",
    "postulate various superpositions of energy eigenstates with distinct energies are no longer excluded ; likewise , a microcanonical state will never correspond to a single eigenstate ( except in the case of the smallest and the largest energy levels if these are nondegenerate ) .",
    "the idea that we investigate here is similar to the classical case , although there is a subtle difference .",
    "classically , the uncertainty in energy is fully characterised by a statistical distribution over the phase space , and for a classical microcanonical distribution having support on a level surface of the hamiltonian the energy variance vanishes .",
    "quantum mechanically , the contribution to the energy variance from the statistical distribution over the phase space also vanishes .",
    "however , if the specified energy level is not the largest or smallest energy eigenvalue , then there is an additional contribution to the energy variance that arises from the intrinsic quantum uncertainty .",
    "therefore , according to our quantum microcanonical postulate the energy variance of a system described by a quantum microcanonical ensemble need not vanish , even though the system is in isolation .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in ",
    "[ sec:2 ] we review briefly the formulation of standard quantum theory in terms of the geometry of the space of pure states , as described , e.g. , in @xcite and references cited therein .",
    "when the trajectory of a wave function is projected from hilbert space @xmath4 to the space @xmath5 of pure states ( rays through the origin of @xmath4 ) , the schrdinger equation on @xmath4 reduces to hamilton s equation on @xmath5 .",
    "more precisely , the space of pure states @xmath5 has a natural symplectic structure ; and the schrdinger trajectories , when projected onto @xmath5 , are the integral curves of the hamiltonian vector field obtained by taking the symplectic gradient of the function on @xmath5 defined by the expectation of the hamiltonian operator . as a consequence , the formulation of quantum mechanics on @xmath5 provides a natural environment in which one can study important issues arising in the context of hamiltonian mechanics , such as ergodicity conditions or the construction of equilibrium ensembles .",
    "for example , the dynamical approach to microcanonical equilibrium introduced by rugh  @xcite for classical systems can be seen to apply in the quantum regime .    in  [ sec:3 ]",
    "we introduce the microcanonical density of states that follows from our weakened microcanonical postulate , together with the associated microcanonical density matrix . in  [ sec:4 ] we derive a general integral representation for the density of states , expressed in terms of the energy eigenvalues .",
    "we then perform the integration explicitly in ",
    "[ sec:5 ] in the case for which the energy spectrum is nondegenerate . as an illustration",
    ", the properties of a system having an equally spaced energy spectrum are studied in detail in  [ sec:6 ] . in this example",
    "we study the relation between the energy and the temperature in some detail , which we plot for a number of different situations . in particular , a simple procedure for rescaling the energy shows that as the dimensionality of the hilbert space increases the system becomes more and more likely to take the intermediate energy value @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are , respectively , the largest and the smallest energy eigenvalues . to study the convergence of the distribution numerically , we compute in ",
    "[ sec:7 ] the hellinger distance between the density of states associated with an @xmath9-level system and an @xmath10-level system for @xmath11 .",
    "the result shows that the logarithmic plot of the relative distances of the distributions against the hilbert space dimensionality lies on a straight line with gradient @xmath12 . finally in  [ sec:8 ] we study the properties of systems having other nondegenerate spectra .",
    "in particular , we show numerically that there is an approximate symmetry relation that holds between a system having the spectrum @xmath13 and a system having the spectrum @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a constant .",
    "in order to investigate properties of a closed , isolated quantum system in equilibrium it will be useful first to recall the hamiltonian formulation of standard quantum mechanics .",
    "this has the advantage of allowing us to apply concepts arising in the corresponding classical theory of equilibria as outlined , for example , in ref .",

    "physical states in quantum mechanics are represented by elements of a complex hilbert space @xmath16 , which we assume to be @xmath10-dimensional .",
    "let us denote by @xmath17 a typical element of @xmath16 , so that the index @xmath18 runs over the range @xmath19 .",
    "the hamiltonian , which acts on elements of @xmath16 , can thus be denoted @xmath20 , and the expectation value of @xmath20 in the state @xmath17 is given by the expression @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the complex conjugate of @xmath17 .",
    "the hilbert space @xmath16 carries an essentially irrelevant complex degree of freedom given by the overall scale of the state vector .",
    "this follows from the fact that the expectation value of a physical observable is invariant under the complex scale transformation @xmath23 , where @xmath24 .",
    "it is useful in some applications to eliminate this extra degree of freedom by considering the space of equivalence classes under the relation @xmath25 for @xmath26 .",
    "this is the space of rays through the origin of @xmath16 , otherwise known as the projective hilbert space @xmath27 of complex dimension @xmath9 .",
    "it is well known that quantum theory , when formulated on the projective space @xmath5 , admits a representation in terms of the standard mathematical structure of hamiltonian mechanics .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "we find it convenient for our purposes to regard the projective space @xmath5 as a real manifold @xmath28 of dimension @xmath29 , letting @xmath30 @xmath31 denote a typical point in @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , each point @xmath32 represents a ray in the hilbert space @xmath4 . in this way we can regard the expectation ( [ eq:1 ] ) as determining a real - valued function @xmath33 on @xmath28 .",
    "the space of pure states , when regarded as the real even - dimensional space @xmath28 , is endowed with a symplectic structure , given by a nondegenerate , antisymmetric two - form @xmath34 .",
    "the dynamical laws governing the trajectories of quantum states , given by the schrdinger equation on @xmath35 , can then be represented on @xmath28 in hamiltonian form as follows : @xmath36 in other words , the space @xmath28 is a symplectic manifold upon which the evolution of a quantum state is governed by hamilton s equations , which in the language of symplectic geometry take the form ( [ eq:2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we can regard @xmath28 as the quantum analogue of a classical phase space . as a consequence we can also formulate our investigation of equilibrium states on @xmath28 .",
    "we begin this section by considering the foliation of the quantum phase space @xmath28 by level surfaces of the hamiltonian function @xmath33 .",
    "this is given by a family of hypersurfaces @xmath37 , @xmath38 $ ] , determined by level values @xmath39 of the hamiltonian function .",
    "the structure of the typical energy surface in quantum mechanics is quite intricate , even for a system described by low - dimensional hilbert space . in particular , as @xmath0 varies in the given range @xmath40 $ ] both the dimensionality and the topology of the associated energy surfaces can change .",
    "an example can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the structures of the energy surfaces for a three - level system are investigated in detail .    now given this foliation ,",
    "the ` number ' of quantum mechanical microscopic configurations ( pure states ) with expected energy in the small range @xmath0 and @xmath1 is @xmath41 , where the state density @xmath42 for energy @xmath0 is given by an expression of the form @xmath43 here the natural vector - valued ( @xmath44)-form @xmath45 on @xmath28 is defined by @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes the totally skew tensor with @xmath9 indices , and @xmath48 is the inverse of the natural riemannian metric @xmath49 on @xmath28 .",
    "the metric @xmath49 is compatible with the symplectic structure @xmath34 in the sense that @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the unique torsion - free covariant derivative operator on @xmath28 satisfying @xmath52 .",
    "it is a remarkable feature of the quantum phase space @xmath28 that it has both a natural riemannian metric and a compatible symplectic structure .",
    "these elements can be regarded as part of the natural geometry of any quantum system .    in the case of an isolated quantum mechanical system with energy in the small range @xmath0 to @xmath1",
    ", we can adopt the notion of the microcanonical ensemble in classical statistical mechanics ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , and identify the entropy of the system by use of the boltzmann relation @xmath53 here we are implicitly assuming what might be called the _ quantum microcanonical postulate _ , which asserts that _ for an isolated system in equilibrium all states on a given energy surface in the quantum phase space are equally probable_. as a consequence , the temperature @xmath54 of such a system is determined by the relation @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath15 is boltzmann s constant . thus for an isolated quantum system with expected energy @xmath0 , we assume that the equilibrium configuration is given by a uniform distribution on the energy surface @xmath57 , with entropy @xmath58 and inverse temperature @xmath59 , as given above .",
    "the corresponding probability density on @xmath60 , which we call the microcanonical @xmath28-distribution , is @xmath61 where @xmath62 here @xmath63 is the volume element on @xmath28 .",
    "it is a straightforward exercise to show that starting from the definition ( [ eq:8 ] ) of the density of states @xmath42 we can deduce the integral formula ( [ eq:3 ] ) .",
    "this can be seen as follows ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "first we note that at each point @xmath64 such that @xmath65 the volume element on @xmath28 can be written as a product @xmath66 where the @xmath67-form @xmath68 defined by @xmath69 is the volume element on the energy surface passing through @xmath70 , and @xmath71 on the other hand , as a consequence of the relation @xmath72 we observe that @xmath73 substituting this expression into ( [ eq:8 ] ) we obtain @xmath74 which agrees with expression ( [ eq:3 ] ) .",
    "a general measurable function @xmath75 on @xmath28 represents a nonlinear observable in the sense of kibble  @xcite and weinberg  @xcite .",
    "the usual ` linear ' observable of standard quantum mechanics then corresponds to the situation for which @xmath75 can be represented as the expectation of a hermitian operator . in either case , for each value of @xmath70 we interpret @xmath75 as the conditional expectation @xmath76 of the observable @xmath77 in the pure state @xmath70 .",
    "the unconditional expectation of @xmath77 in the microcanonical @xmath78-ensemble is then given by @xmath79 in the case of a linear observable we have @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the projection operator onto the state vector @xmath82 corresponding to the pure state @xmath64 . then the unconditional expectation in the state @xmath83 is @xmath84 where the quantum microcanonical density matrix @xmath85 , parameterised by @xmath0 , is defined by @xmath86 providing we only consider linear observables , i.e. as in standard quantum mechanics , the state of the system is then fully characterised by the density matrix @xmath85 .",
    "now suppose @xmath87 denotes the total phase space volume for states such that @xmath88 .",
    "then the density matrix @xmath85 can be calculated explicitly by use of a ` variation - of - parameters ' formula given by @xmath89 this representation can be verified as follows .",
    "from the definition of @xmath87 we can write @xmath90 and hence @xmath91 on the other hand , clearly @xmath92 , and thus we obtain ( [ eq:12 ] ) .",
    "as defined in equation ( [ eq:8 ] ) above , the density of states is given by the volume integral over @xmath28 of a delta - function having a support on the energy surface @xmath93 .",
    "our objective now is to perform the relevant integration explicitly for a generic hamiltonian , and obtain a representation for @xmath42 in terms of the energy eigenvalues .",
    "we find it convenient to pursue the calculation by lifting the integration from the phase space @xmath28 to the hilbert space @xmath4 , imposing the constraint that the norm of the hilbert space vector @xmath17 is unity .",
    "therefore , we write the expression ( [ eq:8 ] ) in the following form : @xmath94 the additional factor of @xmath95 arises here from the superfluous phase integration in ( [ eq:13 ] ) . by use twice of the standard integral representation @xmath96 we thus deduce that @xmath97 { \\rm d}^{n+1}{\\bar z}\\ ; { \\rm d}^{n+1}z .",
    "\\label{eq:15}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we now observe that we can diagonalise the hamiltonian by unitary transformation without affecting any of the terms in ( [ eq:15 ] ) on account of the fact that every ` ket ' vector @xmath17 is coupled to a corresponding ` bra ' vector @xmath22 . therefore , the density of states can be written in the form @xmath98 where @xmath99 are the energy eigenstates .",
    "this is of course a formal expression ; the integration can nevertheless be carried out if we regard ( [ eq:16 ] ) as the limit of a similar integral in which @xmath100 and @xmath101 are displaced into the complex along the negative imaginary axis .",
    "the integration over @xmath102 then reduces to a @xmath103-dimensional gaussian integral , which is readily performed to yield @xmath104 this is the desired integral representation for the density of states , expressed in terms of the energy eigenvalues .",
    "we proceed further by evaluating the integration in ( [ eq:17 ] ) in the case where the hamiltonian has no degenerate eigenvalues .",
    "let us consider the integration in the @xmath100 variable first .",
    "we observe that there are @xmath105 first order poles on the real @xmath100-axis .",
    "an application of cauchy s theorem thus gives us @xmath106 from which it follows that @xmath107 we now recognise the @xmath101-integration formally as the @xmath9-fold repeated integral of the @xmath108-function , defined by the truncated polynomial @xmath109 as a consequence , the density of states associated with a quantum system having a nondegenerate energy spectrum can be seen to be given by an expression of the form given by @xmath110    in addition to the function @xmath42 we find it useful for some purposes to introduce the related normalised density of states @xmath111 defined by @xmath112 the function @xmath111 thus satisfies the property that @xmath113 to calculate the normalisation factor we need to determine the total volume @xmath114 of the quantum phase space .",
    "this is given by @xmath115 where again the factor of @xmath95 in the denominator refers to the removal of the superfluous overall phase of the wave function .",
    "thus , making use of the integral representation of the delta - function , we have @xmath116 where in the last step we have used the identity @xmath117 this is in agreement , e.g. , with the result obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite by use of different methods .",
    "in particular , we note that in the case @xmath118 ( a two - dimensional hilbert space ) the space of pure states @xmath28 is isomorphic to the geometry of a round two - sphere with radius one - half .",
    "we now specialise the analysis further by considering a quantum system whose energy eigenvalues are equally spaced .",
    "there are many elementary systems , such as noninteracting particles with spin , having a spectrum of this kind .",
    "to fix the units of energy we set @xmath119 substituting this in ( [ eq:21 ] ) we obtain @xmath120}^{n}\\left(k-\\frac{e}{\\hbar\\omega } \\right)^{n-1 } \\prod_{l=0,\\neq k}^{n}\\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega(l - k)}. \\label{eq:25}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this expression can be simplified further by writing @xmath121 and hence the microcanonical density of states associated with a system having equally spaced energy spectrum is given by @xmath122}^{n } \\frac{(-1)^k \\left(k - e/\\hbar\\omega\\right)^{n-1 } } { k!(n - k)!}. \\label{eq:27}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] finally , dividing this expression by the normalisation factor ( [ eq:23 ] ) we obtain the following formula for the normalised density of states : @xmath123}^{n } \\frac{(-1)^k \\left(k - e/\\hbar\\omega\\right)^{n-1 } } { k!(n - k)!}. \\label{eq:28}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it will be useful now to indicate what this function looks like in various situations . in figure  [ fig:1 ] we plot @xmath111 for two , three , and four dimensional hilbert spaces .       as in the previous example , in the present case we can rescale the energy spectrum in such a way that we can directly compare the behaviour of the density of states as we increase the number of energy levels .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig:6 ] .",
    "we observe that the density of states becomes more peaked as we increase the number of energy levels .",
    "however , the location of the peak is no longer at @xmath124 , but rather closer to @xmath125 .    as a consequence of the skewed form of the distribution , the range of energy for which the derivative of @xmath111 with respect to @xmath0 remains positive",
    "is somewhat reduced .",
    "this implies that the range of energy associated with positive temperature is reduced from the previous example of linear energy spectrum .",
    "some examples are illustrated in figure  [ fig:7 ] where we plot the temperature dependence of the energy .",
    "as the temperature is increased , the energy grows monotonically and reaches a value around @xmath126 .",
    "the remaining values of the energy are associated with negative temperatures that are inaccessible in equilibrium .",
    "we have examined systems having a linear energy growth and a quadratic energy growth . in the linear case",
    "the microcanonical distribution is symmetric around its centre , while in the quadratic case the peaks of the distributions have shifted to the left with smaller energies .",
    "this leads to the question of what happens to the density of states associated with systems having other spectral structures .    in the case of a system with an infinite number of degrees of freedom ( and thus an infinite number of energy levels )",
    ", the energy spectrum can not grow more rapidly than quadratically in the number of energy levels .",
    "however , for a finite system there is in principle no limitation on how fast the system energy can grow .",
    "therefore , we would like to study the behaviour of the density of states associated with systems having the following two spectral structures : @xmath127 for @xmath128 .",
    "thus in one case the growth of the energy is enhanced as @xmath15 is increased , while in the other case the growth of the energy is suppressed .",
    "various densities of states associated with systems having spectra of the form ( [ eq:41 ] ) are computed numerically and plotted in figure  [ fig:8 ] .",
    "the result shows that as the rate of growth is increased , the location of the peak of @xmath111 becomes smaller , whereas when the rate of energy growth is suppressed , the peak of @xmath111 increases .",
    "in particular , the peak of @xmath111 for the system with energy @xmath129 is located approximately around @xmath130 , while the peak of @xmath111 for the system with energy @xmath131 is located approximately around @xmath132 .",
    "therefore , when @xmath133 , the values of energy that are accessible in equilibrium becomes negligible when @xmath129 , whereas if @xmath134 then virtually all values of @xmath135 $ ] are accessible",
    ".    in conclusion , we note that the analysis we have pursued here is based on a generalised microcanonical postulate , which relaxes the somewhat more stringent assumptions made in the standard quantum microcanonical postulate as outlined in , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite . to determine whether the assumption made in this paper reflects the actual equilibrium distribution of an isolated quantum system it will be desirable to examine the properties of interacting systems . in the case of a general interacting system ,",
    "some of the energy levels are typically highly degenerate , and thus we must return to the integral representation ( [ eq:17 ] ) with a view to deriving an efficient way to carry out the integration in the cases when there are higher - order poles .",
    "this is an intriguing open problem that we hope to investigate elsewhere ."
