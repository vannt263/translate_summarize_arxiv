    "for a long time , since holmberg s first analysis ( holmberg 1958 ) , disk galaxies , including the gas - rich late morphological types , have been taken as largely transparent systems .",
    "although with various refinements , this point of view has been shared by the authors of catalogs of galaxies , such as the relatively recent revised shapley - ames catalog of bright galaxies ( sandage & tamman 1981 ) , and thereby adopted by the majority of the astronomical community .",
    "holmberg inferred average values of the internal extinction on statistical grounds , that is by interpreting the correlation between inclination and mean surface brightness in a rather limited sample of 119 spirals of various morphologies . on the other hand , refined studies of the dust content and distribution of individual ,",
    "representative galaxies are scarce . in the edge - on sc galaxy ngc 891 , kylafis & bahcall ( 1987 )",
    "have been able to determine an overall transparency of the disk , when seen face - on , in a bandpass around 6000 .",
    "recently , however , some studies have shaken the widespread belief in transparent disks ( disney , davies & phillipps 1989 ; valentijn 1990 ) and the issue has rapidly become one of the most contended in the literature on normal galaxies , sometimes with opposite conclusions drawn by the analysis of the same , or similar , set of data ( valentijn 1994 ) .",
    "the idea of opaque galaxies has gained in the last years a certain acceptance and has been shared by the recent third reference catalogue of bright galaxies ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "this debate on the optical thickness of galactic disks is relevant to a number of issues important for extragalactic astronomy .",
    "we mention : ( i ) the morphology and internal structure of galactic components , such as bulges , disks , lenses , bars , etc ; ( ii ) the dark matter content of galaxies and clusters , and ( iii ) the luminosity corrections affecting redshift - independent measures of distances .",
    "the last point , in particular , touches on the field of the large scale structure of the universe , and of the deviations from the hubble flow .    for these reasons , observations and data analyses",
    "are becoming more refined with particular reference to selection biases ( burstein , haynes & faber 1991 ) , to redshift information ( chooniewski 1991 ; giovanelli et al .",
    "1994 ) and to multiwavelength imaging ( peletier et al . 1994 ; evans 1994 ) . at the same time",
    "the modelling has also become increasingly sophisticated .",
    "in fact , as it has been argued by most of the already cited authors , a fundamental problem in statistical evaluations of the extinction lies in the absence of accurate and sensitive observable indicators .",
    "surface brightness , diameters and colors have often been interpreted in the framework of models so naive and unrealistic to yield too simplistic and sometimes wrong results .",
    "a realistic modelling of dusty disks is thus strongly required . besides , if we postulate the possibility of large optical thicknesses and sizeable grain albedos , as it is the case for wavelengths shorter than 3@xmath1 m , then the effect of multiple scattering in composite ( bulge + disk ) systems , with dust interspersed with stars , must be included ( e.g. block et al .",
    "a remarkable progress on this track is achieved in the recent paper by byun , freeman & kylafis ( 1994 , hereafter bfk ) who have produced simulations of disk galaxies of various morphology and optical thickness .",
    "their treatment of the radiative transfer includes exactly the contribution of the first scattering , and approximately the higher scattering orders .",
    "they adopt a henyey - greenstein phase function and a single dust grain with average optical properties according to draine & lee ( 1984 ) .",
    "scattering events are also expected to introduce polarization in the otherwise unpolarized emission from normal stars .",
    "polarimetric studies of normal spirals , both observational and theoretical ones , are scarce .",
    "in view of the current interest in the properties of dusty disks such scarcity is remarkable since most of the information about the physical properties of dust grains is locked into their polarization effects . among the few observations of this kind ,",
    "we mention the detailed studies of m31 , m82 , m104 , and of the magellanic clouds ; they are summarized and referenced by wielebinski & krause ( 1993 ) .",
    "one of the fields where the analysis and simulation of polarization maps has been most effective in recent years is star formation , and , in particular , the study of protostellar envelopes ( see fischer , henning & yorke , 1994 and references therein ) . here",
    "the more recent and detailed models are based on monte carlo simulations which allow for arbitrary distributions of polydispersive mixtures of spherical dust particles . in all these models any observed polarization is imputed to transfer effects on light which is otherwise emitted unpolarized by stars .",
    "in particular , since dust grains are usually assumed to be spherical , homogeneous and optically isotropic , only the polarizing effect of scattering is taken into account .",
    "it is widely known , anyway , that in our galaxy the linear polarization introduced by the light propagation through the interstellar medium is best described as the effect of dichroic absorption by aligned , elongated grains ( spitzer 1978 ; gledhill & scarrot 1989 ) . sometimes , this polarization mechanism has been questioned but , indeed , only for particular situations , where the presence of a suitable toroidal magnetic field , that is the main ingredient for the alignment , is dubious or improbable ( menard 1989 ) .",
    "we present here the results of monte carlo simulations of realistic model galaxies within the frame of mie s scattering theory , that is for spherical dust grains with homogeneus and isotropic optical properties . in our study",
    "the dust grain is not a single , average one but instead we allow for a mixture of different materials and a continuous distribution of size .",
    "the phase function is consistently computed from mie s theory for each grain .",
    "the radiation transfer is exact to any scattering order and complete for the four stokes parameters , so that the output can be analyzed in the form of polarimetric , as well as photometric , maps . stars and dust three - dimensional distributions are the ones commonly accepted , and similar to those adopted by bfk .",
    "the present paper deals only with scattering events on spherical grains and does not include any dichroism in the absorption itself .",
    "the polarization properties may , therefore , be different from those produced by needles rotating , as widely believed , in a galactic meridian plane .",
    "although we deal in this study with the simplest of the realistic cases , that is , smooth distributions and spherical grains , the monte carlo method is ideal to probe more hostile situations .",
    "the effect of clumping in the obscuring dust , of non - spherical dust grains and of extinction by gas at short wavelengths are deferred to future papers .",
    "in the following we describe the model distribution here adopted to simulate the spatial distribution of the photon emitters ( stars ) and of the particles contributing to extinction ( dust ) .",
    "we describe the stellar spatial distribution in a spiral galaxy by two components : a spheroidal bulge and a 3-dimensional disk .",
    "we neglect dark massive halos , since we are only interested in luminous components , and also possible small - scale inhomogeneities such as spiral arms and star - forming regions .",
    "the surface brightness profiles of spheroidal systems is usually well described by the @xmath2 law ( de vaucouleurs 1959 ) : @xmath3 } , \\label{r14}\\ ] ]    where @xmath4 is the equivalent radius , and @xmath5 is the surface brightness of the corresponding isophote ; both @xmath6 and @xmath4 are measured on the sky plane . for numerical purpose ,",
    "it is convenient to have an analytical expression for the bulge luminosity density @xmath7 , which can be obtained deprojecting the profiles . since there is no simple , analytical expression for @xmath7 corresponding to equation ( [ r14 ] ) ( see young 1976 ) we choose to adopt the jaffe distribution which corresponds to the luminosity density ( jaffe 1983 ) : @xmath8 ^ 2 } , \\label{jaffe}\\ ] ]    where @xmath9 is the physical distance from the galactic center , and @xmath10 is the scale radius for wich we adopt @xmath11 ( see appendix  [ asas ] ) .    in principle , there is no need for an external truncation radius for the jaffe distribution since the volume integral converges for @xmath12 ; for numerical purposes , though , we have introduced a truncation radius @xmath13 .",
    "in fact , in absence of an external truncation , at large radii the bulge s light will dominate once again that of the ( exponential ) disk . in the simulations presented here",
    ", we have adopted the values @xmath14  kpc , @xmath15 .",
    "the value for @xmath4 is close to the one inferred for our galaxy ; the value for @xmath16 is such that @xmath17 corresponds to the point where the ratio between the bulge luminosity density and the density of the adopted disk is maximum ( sect .  [ dischi ] ) .",
    "the assumed luminosity density distribution for the disk is ( freeman 1970 ) @xmath18    where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the cylindrical radius and the height above the equatorial plane of the galaxy , respectively , and the costants @xmath21 , @xmath22 are the relative scale lengths ; the function @xmath23 describes the vertical behavior of the distribution , which is assumed to be either exponential or of the type `` sech@xmath24 '' ( van der kruit & searle 1981 ; wainscoat , freeman & hyland 1989 ) ; the results presented in this paper are for the exponential vertical distribution that is @xmath25 in analogy with the bulge case , we have introduced a horizontal , @xmath26 , and a vertical @xmath27 external truncation .",
    "our models are for @xmath28  kpc , @xmath29  kpc , which are similar to what is observed for the old disk population of the galaxy ; for the external truncations we adopt @xmath30 .      to simulate different hubble types , we have run models with different bulge / total luminosity ratios ranging from 0 ( resembling an sd galaxy , bt00 ) to 0.5 ( sa , bt05 ) .",
    "all our simulations are monochromatic and we have run models at the effective wavelengths of the b and i bandpasses , @xmath31 and @xmath32respectively .",
    "possible differences in the stellar population of the two components are taken into account by adopting a b - i color of the bulge larger than that of the disk .",
    "more precisely the luminosity of the bulge has been increased by one magnitude in the i band while the luminosity of the disk has been kept constant in both bands ; therefore we suppose an intrinsic b - i=0 for the disk and b - i=1 for the bulge .",
    "all of these prescriptions conform to those adopted by bfk .",
    "the only absorbing particles included in our code are dust grains ; we neglect the absorption above the lyman limit due to diffuse hydrogen gas , the possible presence of molecules , etc . .",
    "the dust is supposed to be smoothly   distributed in a disk with the same law ( eq .  [ [ disk ] ] ) as for the stellar disk @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the horizontal and vertical dust scale lengths . in this paper",
    "we are mainly interested in determining the effects of a _ standard _ dust layer on the structural parameters and appearance of a galaxy , we will devote a following paper to study the detailed structure and distribution of dust as inferred from the observed light distribution in spiral galaxies .",
    "the galactic parameters for the dust distribution are by far more uncertain than for the stars . for the computations presented here , we have assumed @xmath36  kpc , @xmath37  kpc and the same truncation factor as for the stellar disk .",
    "that is , while the radial extents of the stellar and dust disk are identical , we will always deal with dust disks which are vertically embedded into the star distribution .",
    "this is an important point , since several of the results in the following will be determined by the presence of sizeable stellar emission outside the obscuring layer .",
    "we assume that the dust physical properties ( i.e. the grain size distribution and materials , see below ) are independent of the position in the galaxy and therefore the absorption coefficient at wavelength @xmath38 can be written as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the extinction cross section per unit mass , averaged over the grain distribution and materials ( see eq . [ [ medie ] ] ) .",
    "it is common to normalize the total content of dust in the galaxy in terms of the optical depth along the simmetry axis of the galaxy ,    @xmath41    both for the exponential and sech@xmath24 distributions . as for the stellar disk ,",
    "the results here presented refer to vertically exponential dust disks .      in our model the grains",
    "are supposed to be spherical and to have a size distribution given by the mrn model ( mathis , rumpl & nordsiek 1977 ) , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the grain radius .",
    "we consider three materials : astronomical silicates , @xmath44 graphite , and @xmath45 graphite .",
    "the numerical silicates / graphite ratio is 1:1.12 , with 1/3 of the graphite having optical properties measured parallel ( @xmath44 ) , and 2/3 perpendicular ( @xmath45 ) to the c - axis .",
    "the lower and upper limits of the distribution are @xmath46  @xmath47 m and @xmath48  @xmath47 m , irrespectively of the material . very small grains and pah have not been included due to the large uncertainties both in their size distribution and optical constants .",
    "the dielectric constants adopted are the ones given by draine & lee ( 1984 ) , recently extended in the far uv and x - rays by martin & rouleau ( 1991 ) .",
    "all the relevant optical properties ( absorption and scattering cross section , albedo , phase function , and mueller matrix ) have been calculated using mie formulae .",
    "the resulting extinction curve is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ estinzio ] .    in our models",
    "the central optical depth of the disk is defined by the value at 5500 ; models at different wavelengths are still defined by  but all computations of optical thickness are scaled according to our extinction curve .",
    "the average value of a quantity @xmath49 , over the dust distribution , is here defined as    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the extinction cross section , the index @xmath52 referes to the material , and @xmath53 is its weight in the distribution ; both @xmath49 and @xmath51 depend on @xmath38    previous works dealing with scattering problems have often approximated the phase function @xmath54 with the henyey - greenstein ( hg ) formula ( henyey & greenstein 1941 ) , @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the asymmetry parameter ( that is the average value of @xmath57 weighted by the phase function ) ; @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the polar and azimuthal scattering angles , respectively .    in fig .",
    "[ duefasi ] we show a comparison between the average phase function for the distribution calculated with the monte carlo procedure implemented in our radiative transfer code and the hg phase function for which a value of @xmath56 averaged on the distribution according to equation ( [ medie ] ) has been used .",
    "the differences between the two phase functions are striking ( as an example , the b and i bands are shown ) : _ the hg approximation always underestimates the forward scattering _ by as much as 25 % , the difference being larger in the b band .    for the albedo and asymmetry parameter we obtain @xmath60 and @xmath61 in the b - band , and @xmath62 and @xmath63 in the i - band .",
    "monte carlo methods allow the life of each photon to be followed through scattering and absorption processes . here",
    "we provide a brief description of our computational scheme , deferring the interested reader to the appendix for a more detailed presentation .",
    "we determine first the position of the photon emission point , according to the bulge and disk luminosities as described in sect .",
    "[ distri ] .",
    "photons are emitted isotropically and unpolarized .",
    "the stokes parameters are defined for each photon on the plane perpendicular to its propagation vector , following the conventions in shurcliff ( 1962 ) ; the reference direction on such plane is the projection of the galactic @xmath20 axis ( i.e. the simmetry axis ) .",
    "all photons are emitted with the same intensity , or strength , that is with the first stokes parameter @xmath64 .",
    "the emission cycle requires five random numbers : three for the position and two for the direction ( see appendix  [ a_1 ] ) .",
    "then we determine the position of the scattering point , i.e. , the position at which the photon collides with a dust grain ; grains are assumed to be distributed as described in sect .",
    "this implies to determine first an optical depth @xmath65 for the scattering point , and then the geometrical position along the line of propagation where this @xmath65 is actually reached .",
    "it turns out that this second step is the most consuming , in terms of computational time , of the whole process ( appendix  [ a_2 ] ) .",
    "once the position of the scattering event is known , we pass to determine the characteristics of the dust grain , according to the size and composition distributions ( appendix  [ a_3 ] ) .",
    "note that in principle such a sequence renders rather straightforward to allow for situations where the physical properties of dust vary within the galaxy , e.g. with galactocentric distance .",
    "these steps require two more random numbers , one to locate the diffusion point , the other to fix the size and composition of the scatterer . knowing the radius and refractive index of the grain ( together with @xmath38 ) , it is now possible to compute the ( polar ) phase function and the albedo , and , by extracting a new random number , to choose the ( polar ) angle of scattering @xmath58 .",
    "together with the geometro - optical properties of the dust grain , and within the frame of mie s theory , @xmath58 determines completely the elements of the scattering ( mueller ) matrix .",
    "the matrix elements also enter into the expression for the azimuthal phase function , so that , by extracting a new , final random number we define completely direction and stokes vector of the scattered photon ( see appendix  [ a4 ] ) .",
    "the updated stokes parameters are calculated via the following transformation @xmath66 the rotation matrix @xmath67 transforms the initial stokes parameters into a new set whose reference direction for linear polarization lies in the scattering plane .",
    "@xmath68 is the relevant mueller matrix with reference to the scattering plane , which depends only on @xmath58 and on the dust properties ; the matrix @xmath69 provides the final transformation of the stokes parameters to the final reference direction , that is the projection of the @xmath20 axis onto the plane normal to the new direction of propagation . in our formulation",
    "we make use of normalized mueller matrices , the absolute values of the stokes parameter are adjusted according to the incoming intensity @xmath70 and to the albedo of the scatterer . in summary",
    "a single scattering cycle needs the extraction of four random numbers : one to locate the diffusion point , one to choose the size and type of grain , and two for the direction of the scattered photon .",
    "the scattering cycle is iterated until the photon escapes the dust layer . or dies because its strength @xmath70 goes below a threshold value ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "the output of the code consists of @xmath72 maps , for each stokes parameter , where @xmath72 is the number of bands of different galaxy inclination to the line of sight ( appendix  [ a_5 ] ) .",
    "the models presented here are obtained with @xmath72 = 15 , and each map has an extent of 201x201 pixels , with a spatial resolution of 0.2 kpc ; the resolution is therefore moderate both in space and in inclination .    a full model ( bulge+disk ) with enough signal to noise ratio to distinguish a clear polarization pattern in the outer parts of the galaxy ( with linear polarization degree of @xmath73 1% ) required a number of photon launches of the order of @xmath74 . anyway , photometric accuracies comparable to those of astronomical images are usually attainable with less than @xmath75 launches .",
    "the code has been tested on a variety of more simple and predictable situations : point sources within spherical scattering envelopes , rayleigh scattering , optically thin regimes , absorption only , etc ..",
    "in summary , the models presented here were all obtained for : bulge effective radius @xmath76 kpc , truncated at @xmath77 kpc ; disk radial scale length @xmath78 kpc , truncated at @xmath79 kpc ; disk exponential vertical scale length @xmath80 kpc , truncated at @xmath81 kpc ; dust radial scale length @xmath36 kpc , truncated at @xmath79 kpc ; dust exponential vertical scale length @xmath37 kpc , truncated at @xmath82 kpc .",
    "all of the results obtained do not depend on the adopted truncation factor as far as they exceed 5 scale lengths .",
    "we ran simulations for 6 different values of : 0.0 , 0.5 , 1.0 , 2.0 , 5.0 , 10.0 ; and for 4 different b / t ratios : 0.0 , 0.1 , 0.3 , 0.5 .",
    "the average angle  , where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the limiting values for the @xmath52-th inclination band . ] to the line of sight of the 8 independent inclination bands , was @xmath85= 20@xmath86 , 37@xmath86 , 48@xmath86 , 58@xmath86 , 66@xmath86 , 75@xmath86 , 82@xmath86 , 90@xmath86 .",
    "all these models were produced both at 4400 for the b - band , and at 9000 , for the i - band .",
    "we also ran some simulations , although not a complete set , at 3500  ( u - band ) .",
    "since the adopted range of parameters conforms to the one used by bfk , we can directly compare our results with theirs .",
    "all the results about minor and major axis profiles80@xmath86 and @xmath872 , resemble closely the type ii profiles defined by freeman ( 1970 ) .",
    "anyway , as noted by the same author , they often show up also in galaxies with a low dust content , such as s0 s , and therefore their explanation seems to require peculiar stellar distributions in addition to extinction effects . ] , total extinction , face - on corrections , isophote shapes and diameters agree remarkably well and therefore we refer to their work ( for a more thorough discussion see bianchi 1995 ) .",
    "most of differences between our results and those of bfk are mainly imputable to the choice of the extinction law .",
    "while bfk use the empirical data of rieke & lebofsky ( 1985 ) , that gives @xmath88 , we conform to the mrn and draine & lee ( 1984 ) model ( sect .",
    "[ compone ] , fig .",
    "[ estinzio ] ) and obtain @xmath89 .",
    "additional differences arise from the finite spatial resolution of our images and from the finite resolution in inclination to the line of sight , as explained in appendix  [ immaginare ] .",
    "however these differences are relevant only when intensity varies greatly with position and inclination ( the edge - on case )    we point out that the central surface brightness of disks with large optical depth still varies with inclination due to stars not immersed in dust , if indeed the dust scale height is smaller than for stars . in addition , in the b - band , the difference between edge - on and face - on central surface brightness is the same for models with @xmath90 , corresponding to 0.3 magnitudes . this common behavior makes the study of central surface brightness unsuitable to the determination of the optical depth of the dust disk in spiral galaxies . as for the influence of scattering ,",
    "the main ( and obvious ) result is a substantial reduction of the actual extinction for a given . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ differe ] , such reduction is higher for greater  and lower inclination , with a maximum of @xmath91 mag for b - band models . for edge - on models , the difference is less than 0.1 mag , so that neglecting the effect of scattering when fitting the brightness profiles of highly inclined objects can be rather justified ( ohta & kodaira 1995 ) .      the differences between models including scattering and models with absorption only can also be appreciated by analyzing the local extinction . in fig .",
    "[ loce ] we plot the central extinction ( @xmath92 ) for models in the b band ( @xmath93 ) with @xmath94 ( our inclination nearest to face - on ) as a function of the central optical depth .",
    "the straight line corresponds to the holmberg screen model , while dotted ones to sandwich models ( disney _ et  al .",
    "_ 1989 ) with different @xmath95 , the dust - to - stellar thickness ratio .",
    "the left panel is for models with absorption only , while the right panel includes the scattering : screen and sandwiches are the same in both panels , and only include absorption .",
    "models with absorption only show that the behavior of the central extinction in the pure disk models ( bt00 ) can be described locally by a sandwich with @xmath96 , while models including a bulge require inverse sandwiches , that is with dust extending higher than stars from the equatorial plane ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "this is because the bulk of the emission at the center , that is the bulge core , is located inside the dust layer .    in models with scattering ( right panel )",
    "we note that the central extinction is reduced by several tenths of magnitude since the radiation has a good probability to be diffused by the dust , rather than absorbed .",
    "this is because , with our assumptions about the dust composition and size distribution , the average albedo amounts to @xmath98 , both in the b and i - band .",
    "moreover the behavior of scattering models is very different from that of sandwiches .    in fig .",
    "[ loce1r0 ] we show the extinction at @xmath99 on the major axis , as a function of the local vertical optical depth , for the same models as in figure  [ loce ] . since the bulge contribution is small at this distance , all the models present nearly the same behavior , principally regulated by the disk . also",
    ", models with scattering show again that sandwiches are a poor approximation .",
    "it is interesting to note that for @xmath100 scattering plays such a role that extinction is basically absent .",
    "intensity images and b - i color maps bring additional information . in fig .",
    "[ compo ] we show images in the b - band and color maps for a bulge , a disk and a bt05 model , with inclination @xmath101 and @xmath102 . since the extinction for bulge and disk is due to the same dust disk , the bt05 model is simply a superposition of the first two images .",
    "we have used the same gray scale for the intensity images , while color maps have different scales to evidence the details .",
    "extinction is more pronunced in the bulge because stars and dust are not homogeneously mixed and the dust acts almost like a screen .",
    "however , extinction also modifies the shape of the disk which becomes asymmetric with respect to the major axis .",
    "color maps are positive everywhere , also in pure disks ( intrinsic b - i=0 ) , indicating a general reddening .",
    "the red color of the outer `` halo '' in the bt05 maps is due to the intrinsic ( b - i=1 ) color of the bulge ( the different appearance is due to different gray scales ) .",
    "the expected effect of scattering on colors is to render bluer the zones of an image where a substantial fraction of emerging radiation is contributed by forward scattering .",
    "this is due to the more asymmetric phase function at shorter @xmath38 ( sect .",
    "[ compone ] ) .",
    "this effect should be more evident in highly inclined objects and in the regions of the ( dust ) disk situated between the observer and the bright bulge core ( elvius 1956 ) .    analyzing the pure bulge color maps we do note a less red lane near the center , coincident with the dust disk plane , but still with b - i@xmath103 .",
    "this `` blue '' lane can not be accounted for by scattering effects , since it is present also in models with absorption only .",
    "it is due , instead , to the heavy extinction of the central parts .",
    "where this happens , the observed emission is mostly due to stars located out of the dust layer , and , therefore , the reddening is small .",
    "the reddest parts are in fact those where the local opacity ( along the line of sight ) is high but less than about 15 .",
    "we note that when scattering is included , due to the lower effective opacity for a given this effect is reduced and the central equatorial lane actually becames redder .",
    "the disk presents this lane as well , but the contrast is not so strong ; as an example , we show in fig .",
    "[ grad ] the results along the major axis of a pure disk with = 5 at various inclinations : the right panel is for a model with scattering , while the left is for pure absorption .",
    "the study of the color profile has been suggested by bfk as a possible tool to infer the ( local ) optical depth : color gradients are located in regions where the optical depth along line of sight is @xmath104 .",
    "our models agree with this result .",
    "besides , the shape of color profiles , and then the position of gradients , is about the same with or without scattering ; this means that pure absorption models can provide sufficiently good @xmath65 diagnostic .",
    "we have also performed simulations in u - band . scattering effects in this wavelength are similar to those in the b - band and , therefore , u - b color maps are not appreciably different from those obtained with simpler absorption models .",
    "we now examine the polarization properties of our models .",
    "the range of parameters explored is the same as for the surface brightness maps .",
    "while the polarization introduced by a single scattering is usually conspicuous , it will be seen that the predicted degree of linear polarization is low ( a few percent ) .",
    "this is due to three different causes :    1 .",
    "photons emerging from the same position in a map can be either _ primitive _ , unpolarized photons , emitted by stars and escaped without having been intercepted by dust , or scattered , polarized photons .",
    "the first cause of low polarization is , therefore , the dilution by primitive radiation , which is higher in the regions of higher surface brightness , such as the central parts of both bulges and disks .",
    "2 .   if we restrict ourselves to the contribution to a certain pixel of scattered photons only , the resultant polarization will be maximum if the scattered photons have similar histories .",
    "so , the requirement for a high degree of polarization is threefold : first , the main contribution must come from single scattering events ; second , photons must be scattered within a thin region along the line of sight ; third , the scattering region must be illuminated from a narrow solid angle .",
    "the first and second requirements are usually met in the parameter range of our models .",
    "the third one requires a compact stellar distribution with respect to the dust disk and is only met by the bulge component .",
    "3 .   the polarization will obviously be highest if the scattering grains are identical . as mentioned",
    "previously our models make use of a distribution of grains in size and composition , and to each size and composition our code assigns , for a given scattering angle , a different mueller matrix . as a result",
    ", photons emitted by the same star and scattered at the same point in the same direction may have quite different polarization properties , depending on the characteristics of the scattering grain .",
    "the maps that we will examine are obtained by averaging the images for the various stokes parameters within 10x10 pixel squares .",

    "the disk of dust is the same in all cases , namely the one with highest optical depth , @xmath105 .",
    "the degree of polarization comes out to be higher for larger optical depths . for the bt05 model of fig .",
    "[ polexa ] at 75@xmath86 inclination , the largest polarization degree is about 1.5% ; in the same conditions but with @xmath106 the maximum is 0.8% .",
    "the zones of highest polarization are always located on , or near , the major axis . another notable feature of our models is that , while increasing the location of the maximum polarization moves outward ; this is illustrated by the sequences in fig .",
    "[ polprof ] . that show the behavior of the polarization degree along the major axis , with galactocentric distance for some of our models .    clearly , for the reasons discussed above , the main contribution comes from scattering of the radiation from the bulge .",
    "this component has a more compact distribution with an emissivity highly peaked at the center , which is seen by the scatterers in the disk almost as a point source .",
    "the case of a pure bulge best illustrates the dilution of polarization by direct radiation ; the maximum degree of polarization does not vary appreciably with inclination .",
    "pure disks show very little polarization when seen face - on ; this fact is mainly due to the rather flat distribution of disk stars .",
    "the polarization degree increases with inclination , with a maximum around 50@xmath86 - 80@xmath86 and then decreases again slightly , due to the long line of sight through the disk when approaching 90@xmath86 . as a rule , in composite models",
    "the scattering of disk radiation will provide the polarization of the inner regions while the bulge will mainly polarize the external disk .",
    "note how the strong polarization of the outer disk in case of a pure bulge ( @xmath107 ) is diluted by direct disk light and reduced to 1.0 - 1.5% . as a consequence ,",
    "the morphology of the polarization pattern , when seen at favorable inclinations ( 50@xmath86 - 80@xmath86 ) , is different in systems with different bulge luminosities : late spirals will have a more uniform elliptical pattern , and early ones a two lobe structure aligned along the major axis .    as for the direction of the linear polarization vector",
    ", it is invariably aligned perpendicularly to the major axis .",
    "this means that , for the scattered field , the * e * component perpendicular to the plane of scattering * e@xmath108 * , is higher than the parallel one @xmath109 for most of the directions with a sizeable phase function .",
    "this is the situation commonly observed in scattering by small particles , where @xmath110 , as it is the case , for example , in electron scattering .",
    "when dealing with dust grains with refractive indexes around one , this is not the only possible situation .",
    "the pattern can be inverted , in principle , at larger values of @xmath111 , see for example fig .",
    "25 of van de hulst ( 1957 ) .",
    "we have performed a few simulations to check if , with larger grains or at smaller @xmath38 , the pattern would appreciably change , in the sense of a polarization pattern with a definite alignment along the equator , when seen edge - on .",
    "our results indicate that , for any reasonable dust composition and size distribution , this situation is difficult to achieve for @xmath112   .",
    "the reason is that , at such wavelenghts , the scattered field is mainly contributed by grafite ( @xmath113 ) grains which have a ( real ) refractive index @xmath114 .",
    "this requires , for a radical change in the pattern direction , values of @xmath115 , which means , in the visual ( @xmath116 ) , a lower cutoff @xmath117 m instead of the canonical @xmath118 m .",
    "the resulting polarization map for such a model is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ paralle ] ( note the low polarization degree ) .",
    "another point to mention is the comparison between the polarization maps and the isophotal ones : two aspects are noticeable .",
    "first , althought the brightest , inner parts show very little polarization , measurable values ( @xmath119 ) are diffuse over most of the galaxy image , well inside the 25 b - mag arcsec@xmath120 , and , therefore , accessible to observations ( fig .",
    "[ osserva ] ) .",
    "second , for a given model and inclination , we find little spatial correlation between extinction and polarization , even in highly inclined models with large @xmath121 ; for example , the equatorial dust lanes of highly inclined disks are not strongly polarized .",
    "this is another signature that polarization is mainly contributed by single scattering events in the outer layers of the disk .",
    "a clear prediction of our models concerns the wavelength dependence of the degree of linear polarization , which we find to increase from the b to the i - band .",
    "this appears to be a general rule , indipendently of b / t ratios , , and inclination .",
    "such effect is ascribed to the reduced extinction in the i - band and the subsequent increase of the number of single scatterings .",
    "most of the effects mentioned above are clearly depicted in fig .",
    "the positions of the maxima coincide with regions where the local optical depth is @xmath104 , similarly to what previously observed for color gradients .",
    "if the number of scattering is larger than one , mie scattering can in principle introduce a certain degree of local circular polarization . in all our model",
    "the circular polarization degree is contained within the noise level and never shows at levels higher then 0.1% .",
    "to study the extinction and polarization properties of dusty spiral galaxies , we have performed extensive monte carlo simulations using realistic galaxy models that include both a bulge and a disk component , simulating different hubble types .",
    "the scattering properties are calculated from mie s theory for each dust grain ; in addition , we follow the radiative transfer of the four stokes parameters .",
    "the grains are assumed to be spherical , with a power - law size distribution , and consisting either of graphite or silicate .",
    "this enables us to produce both photometric and polarimetric maps of the galaxy for different optical depths , inclinations and b / t ratios ; the main results derived from the analysis of such maps are summarized in the following .    in general , we find a very good agreement with the results of bfk , who used a series of approximations described above , concerning luminosity profiles , total extinction , isophote shapes and diameters .",
    "we have shown that the overall effect of scattering ( with respect to pure absorption ) is to reduce the extinction for a given .",
    "such decrement in the effective @xmath93 is particularly evident in the central parts of bright bulges , as shown in fig .",
    "[ loce ] , although the extinction fractional reduction is larger for late - type than for early - type spirals and increases with galactocentric distance .",
    "sandwich models , often used in the literature , are shown to fail dramatically in reproducing the extinction - optical depth relation when scattering is properly considered , and they should not be used . from the analysis of the b -",
    "i color maps we conclude that there is a net reddening of the galaxy due to dust even when scattering is included .",
    "in fact , the latter reduces on average the b - i color by about 0.1  mag , a mild but appreciable effect .",
    "radial color gradients are found to exist in regions where the optical depth is of order unity .",
    "the degree of linear polarization produced by scattering is usually small ( of the order of a few percent ) , but still practically measurable .",
    "the reasons for this behavior are : ( i ) there is a dilution effect by direct stellar ( unpolarized ) radiation ; ( ii ) scattering region is usually illuminated from a large solid angle , thus photons with different histories enter the same beam , and ( iii ) the distribution of grain sizes and materials degrades the coherence of the polarization .",
    "most of the polarization comes from light from the bulge which is single scattered by the outer layers of the disk .",
    "this is not surprising , of course , since the bulge is more compact and resembles a point source .",
    "the polarization degree increases with the optical depth and with inclination , flattening out above @xmath122 .",
    "the polarization pattern is found to be perpendicular to the major axis , independently of the morphology , inclination and optical depth ; this result depends only on the optical properties of the dust grains , and can be reversed only by shifting to much larger radii the lower limit for the dust size .",
    "it is interesting to note that some galaxies do show polarization patterns similar to those of our models ( scarrott , rolph , & semple 1990 ; fendt et al .",
    "1995 ) . among them",
    ", late type galaxies ( ngc 5907 , ngc 891 ) show polarization perpendicular to the major axis on the entire extent of the disk ; early type galaxies ( ngc 4594 , ngc 4565 ) , instead , show such polarization in the outer regions of the disk , whereas the central parts have polarization vectors consistent with dichroic absorption , that is parallel to the major axis .",
    "when polarization vectors are perpendicular to the major axis , the observed degree of linear polarization is about one percent , in agreement with our models .    finally , there is little correlation between extinction and polarization degree and there is a trend of increasing polarization from the b to the i band due to the reduced extinction in the i band and subsequent increase of single scatterings .",

    "photons are emitted by stars distributed in the galactic disk and bulge .",
    "the first step is to determine the coordinates of the star ( i.e. the photon emission point ) according to the star density distributions .",
    "using the jaffe law , and substituting equation ( [ jaffe ] ) in equation ( [ a1 ] ) , one finds a simple relation between the radial distance and a random number @xmath134 @xmath135 where @xmath16 is the truncating factor of the jaffe bulge and @xmath10 the scale radius .",
    "the @xmath2 and jaffe distributions are relatively similar , but the relation between @xmath10 and @xmath4 depends on which physical parameters , and parts of the galaxy , we intend to match best . to our purpose , we need the relation fitting the luminosity within a given @xmath9 , since this is the physical variable which we will directly associate with the monte carlo random numbers ( this will be the case for the disk radial distribution as well ) . in this sense ,",
    "when uniformly sampled over the luminosity content , the best correspondence between the two distributions is found for @xmath11 .",

    "a photon emitted in ( @xmath159,@xmath160,@xmath140 ) along the direction @xmath161 travels undisturbed until it collides with a dust grain .",
    "if undisturbed , the geometrical path within the dust distribution would be : @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the t - value corresponding to the point of exit from the dust disk .",
    "the total optical depth @xmath164 along this path is @xmath165 where we made use of equation ( [ norma ] ) , and @xmath166 .",
    "a fraction @xmath167 of the photons will then emerge undisturbed from the system , while the remaining @xmath168 will be absorbed or diffused in other directions .",
    "the point of diffusion is associated with a random number @xmath169 , which determines the total optical depth at the diffusion point according to @xmath170 or @xmath171 if @xmath65 is greater than @xmath164 , the photon will exit without scattering .",
    "this procedure , however , is quite inefficient : if @xmath164 is small , most of the photons will exit directly . to overcome this problem ,",
    "we have used the method of _ forced scattering _ introduced by cashwell & everett ( 1959 ; see also witt 1977 ) . with this method",
    "the photon is split into two components : one , with intensity @xmath172 , keeps travelling undisturbed and exits the dust disk , the other , with intensity @xmath173 is forced to scatter .",

    ", @xmath65 tends to the value for unforced scattering .",
    "the other stokes parameters are scaled accordingly . forcing the scattering has also the effect of reducing the noise in the resulting images , for the same total number of photons launches , but it is appreciably more time consuming .",
    "we performed a series of trial simulations using a point source embedded in spherical envelopes of optical opacity from 1 to 10 . as a result of these tests",
