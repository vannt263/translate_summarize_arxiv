    "the simplest vortex dynamics in a superfluid corresponds to the two - dimensional motion of a rectilinear vortex filament @xcite .",
    "in fact , in an infinite superfluid a vortex  charged \" with one quantum of counterclockwise circulation will move like an electron in a uniform magnetic field , ie performing a circular cyclotron motion ruled by : @xmath0 here @xmath1 denotes the vortex effective mass per unit length , @xmath2 the number density of the background superfluid at rest , @xmath3 the planck s constant and @xmath4 the two - dimensional coordinate of the vortex core .",
    "we note that the magnus force in the right - hand side of is formally equivalent to the lorentz force on a negative point charge in a uniform magnetic field parallel to the @xmath5 axis .",
    "actually , this electromagnetic analogy is only a part of a whole mapping by which a 2-d homogeneous superfluid can be mapped onto a ( 2 + 1)-d electrodynamic system , with vortices and phonons playing the role of charges and photons , respectively @xcite .",
    "for instance , any accelerated motion of a vortex would result in the radiation of sound waves in the superfluid , ie the emission of phonons , a process which is entirely analogous to the photon radiation mechanism stemming from an accelerated charge in electrodynamics . in practice , however , this simple picture only would apply to a superfluid formed by @xmath6he atoms , viz the boson isotope of helium , at low temperatures ( @xmath70.4 k ) . ordinary helium , on the other hand , contains a small amount of impurity , fermion @xmath8he atoms , which however produces a viscous drag force on a moving vortex at the lowest temperatures .",
    "in fact , below 0.4 k the scattering of thermal phonons by the vortex has negligible effects compared to the drag force due to @xmath8he scattering @xcite .",
    "in addition , at higher temperatures ( @xmath90.5 k ) , most of the elementary excitations of the superfluid @xmath6he that collide with the vortex are _ rotons _ , ie quasiparticles having their momentum around the minimum of the dispersion curve .",
    "in fact , ( see figure 1 ) only the elementary excitations with momentum below 0.5 @xmath10 can be regarded as phonons arising from a linear dispersion relation @xmath11 , whereas the rest of the dispersion curve do not yield thermal elementary excitations , except for a small interval around the minimum ( @xmath12 1.9 @xmath10 ) .",
    "quasiparticles with momentum at the right ( left ) of this minimum have their group velocity parallel ( antiparallel ) to their momentum and are called @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) rotons . above 0.5 k",
    "the source of the drag force on a vortex in ordinary helium is roton scattering , being the effect of @xmath8he collisions practically negligible .",
    "whatever the source , however , such a drag force can be written as two additional terms in the right - hand side of equation , viz @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote _ transversal _ and _ longitudinal _ friction coefficients , respectively @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to compare in figure 1 the dispersion curve for elementary excitations in superfluid @xmath6he , with the energy spectrum of @xmath8he atoms in ordinary helium .",
    "such solvated atoms behave like heavier free particles ( @xmath18 ) with an effective mass @xmath19 which exceeds two times the mass of a bare @xmath8he atom . as a final remark about figure 1",
    "we note that the terminations of both curves are due to unstabilities caused by roton creation processes .",
    "that is , any elementary excitation exceeding two times the roton energy should be unstable against decay into two rotons , whereas @xmath8he atoms exceeding the roton energy should decay into a low energy atom plus a roton .",
    "here it is important also to take into account another consequence of the above scattering processes , apart from the friction itself , that is the thermal excitation of vortex waves @xcite .",
    "these are helical waves in which each vortex line element executes a circular motion about the undisturbed line ( @xmath5 axis ) .",
    "the radius of such a circle is assumed to be much smaller than the wavelength , so the above elements will keep almost parallel to the @xmath5 axis , fulfilling an equation of motion like .",
    "in fact , such an equation has to be generalized to the situation where there exists an external superfluid flow of velocity @xmath20 : @xmath21 such an external superflow corresponds in our case to the local self - induced velocity generated by the vortex line curvature @xcite , @xmath22 , which points in a direction opposite to the one of the superfluid velocity field generated by the undisturbed vortex line .",
    "this self - induced velocity , being proportional to the line displacement @xmath23 from the @xmath5 axis , can be written as @xmath24 , where @xmath25\\label{p4}\\ ] ] corresponds to the well - known dispersion relation for kelvin waves of long wavelength @xmath26 , @xmath27 , being @xmath28 , @xmath29 1 @xmath30 vortex core parameter and @xmath31 = mass of a @xmath6he atom .",
    "notice that the wave vector @xmath32 , which points along the @xmath5 axis , can take positive or negative values depending on the two ways of generating the vortex helix .",
    "then , equation can be rewritten @xmath33 where @xmath34 corresponds to the cyclotron frequency arising from the equation of motion .",
    "actually , it is easy to check that the equation allows both possible directions for circular motion , since a replacement @xmath35 const , @xmath36 in leads to a quadratic equation in the angular frequency @xmath37 with solutions : @xmath38.\\ ] ] that is , in the limit @xmath39 we have either the counterclockwise cyclotron motion of frequency @xmath40 , or the usual clockwise polarization of kelvin waves @xmath41 ( cf ) , for vortices of counterclockwise circulation and negligible mass ( @xmath42 ) . actually , there is no experimental data about vortex trajectories , so the value of the vortex mass @xmath1 and hence of @xmath43 , can only be extracted from theoretical considerations . if @xmath1 is calculated from a classical hydrodynamical model , @xmath43 should be about 3 ps@xmath10 @xcite , whereas more recent theories , for which @xmath1 should be logarithmically divergent with the system size , lead to @xmath43 s of order @xmath44 ps@xmath10 , for typical experimental conditions @xcite .",
    "all these figures are consistent with the approximation @xmath45 for long wavelengths @xmath27 , where the dependence on @xmath32 of the frequency @xmath46 can be neglected @xcite .    finally , the vortex equation of motion is obtained by adding both effects , friction and oscillations together : @xmath47.\\label{p8}\\ ] ] note that in addition to the time dependence of @xmath48 , one should take into account a parametric dependence @xmath49 following the helix curvature .    to this point",
    "we have regarded the vortex coordinates as classical time - dependent variables , but it is important to observe in this respect that the above theoretical estimates of the cyclotron frequency yield values of @xmath50 greater than @xmath120.1 for @xmath51 k. this seems to indicate that a classical treatment can not be wholly satisfactory .",
    "moreover , even in the case of purely low - frequency kelvin waves , the need of a quantum mechanical analysis was early pointed out by fetter @xcite .",
    "such a theory was in fact used to study phonon scattering by a vortex @xcite , and it is our purpose to present in this article a more general treatment at which the vortex mass , and hence the cyclotron frequency , are included in the theory and assigned finite values .",
    "our starting point will be a vortex hamiltonian from which the equation of motion derives . then , after quantization of the vortex variables , we will show that such a hamiltonian consists of independent harmonic oscillator modes of frequencies @xmath43 and @xmath52 , which interact with the heat bath represented by the ordinary helium at a finite temperature .",
    "such an interaction is modelled through a generic momentum - conserving scattering hamiltonian , which is used to study the dissipative dynamics of the cyclotron modes .",
    "thus , we shall show that the friction turns out to be essentially unaffected by such oscillations , allowing us to extend our previous conclusions on the memory effects on straight vortex lines @xcite .",
    "a similar behaviour was long ago reported by fetter @xcite and sonin @xcite for the low - frequency kelvin modes , showing that the dissipation of such modes remains essentially equal to that of strictly rectilinear vortices .",
    "our main objective in the present paper will be to analyze , within the framework of linear response theory @xcite , the non - equilibrium dynamics and the equilibrium quantum fluctuations of the energy of the cyclotron modes .",
    "there exists an extensive literature on quantal brownian motion of harmonic oscillators @xcite , but it is important to realize that our problem presents a number of distinctive features that are not found in previous treatments , namely    \\(i ) most of such previous studies have been focused on the coordinates or the momentum of the oscillator , rather than on the energy , eg treatments of the time correlation function of the energy are rather uncommon .",
    "\\(ii ) it is evident that we are dealing with a very special heat bath , since in addition to being formed by fermi particles and bose quasiparticles , such bosons are characterized by a complex dispersion relationship which gives rise to different species ( phonons , rotons r@xmath53 and r@xmath54 ) .",
    "\\(iii ) the drag force on vortices that has been experimentally detected arise from scattering , thus we leave aside from our study the phonon radiation damping @xcite .",
    "we note that such a scattering interaction hamiltonian is also unusual since it must be nonlinear in the heat bath operators .",
    "in fact , most of the brownian motion models assume that the heat bath couples _ linearly _ to the harmonic oscillator , but in our case it is easy to realize that the scattering events must involve products of creation and annihilation operators of the particles that collide with the vortex .",
    "\\(iv ) our recent study @xcite has shown that the drag force could be affected by appreciable memory effects , so it will be important to extend our treatment beyond the usual markovian approximation to explore such possible effects .",
    "a suitable formalism to handle the above items can be found in reference @xcite , where a non - markovian calculation of the energetic susceptibility of a harmonic oscillator , weakly coupled to boson and fermion environments , was carried out .",
    "so , we shall base our treatment on the above formalism .",
    "this paper is organized as follows , in the following section we describe our quantum model for the dissipative vortex dynamics which leads to an analysis of vortex oscillations and memory effects .",
    "next in section 3 we summarize the main results of linear response theory applied to the vortex energy . in section 4 ,",
    "based on the previous calculation of the harmonic oscillator susceptibility , we analize memory corrections to the markov approximation . in section 5",
    "we calculate the response and time correlation functions , and study the dependence of the relaxation frequency on temperature and impurity concentration .",
    "finally , in section 6 we gather the summary and main conclusions of our study .",
    "we start from a vortex hamiltonian given by , @xmath55 where @xmath56 corresponds to the vortex velocity @xmath57 and @xmath58 denotes the vortex canonical momentum .",
    "the second term in corresponds to that of the vector potential ( central gauge ) in the electromagnetic analogy , and the @xmath5 dependence in which arises from @xmath49 and @xmath59 , corresponds to the rotation in the @xmath60-@xmath61 plane parametrized by @xmath5 , which results from following the helix path . note that both the canonical momentum @xmath58 and the hamiltonian are given per unit length of the @xmath5 axis .",
    "then , it is easy to verify that the hamilton equations lead from to the equation of motion .",
    "the two - dimensional coordinate @xmath48 of the vortex core can be written as the sum of the center coordinate @xmath62 of the cyclotron circle plus the relative coordinate @xmath63 from such a center .",
    "then , the quantization of such variables straightforwardly arises from the electromagnetic analogy : @xmath64\\label{p11}\\\\ { \\bf r } ' & = & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\\pi\\rho_sl}}[(a^\\dagger+a)\\hat{x}+i(a- a^\\dagger)\\hat{y}],\\label{p12}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) denotes a creation operator of right ( left ) circular quanta @xcite and @xmath67 denotes the vortex line length .",
    "the @xmath5 dependence of @xmath48 arises from the replacements @xmath68 , @xmath69 in and , and correspondingly for the annihilation operators .",
    "actually , fetter s theory identifies @xmath70 as the whole displacement from the @xmath5 axis ( see @xcite , equation ( 14 ) ) .",
    "analogous quantization for the canonical momentum @xmath58 leads through and to a vortex hamiltonian @xmath71 where it is worthwhile noticing that @xmath72 and @xmath73 in turn out to be independent of @xmath5 , as expected .",
    "the above hamiltonian can be written to first order in @xmath74 as , @xmath75 where both polarizations ( cyclotron and kelvin modes ) become decoupled . to prove this approximation",
    ", we first note that the set of eigenfunctions of are represented by wave functions corresponding to well - defined values of both numbers of circular quanta , right and left @xcite . on the other hand , the schrdinger equation for the hamiltonian ,",
    "can be easily solved by noting that the term proportional to @xmath73 in the expression , can be added to the corresponding term arising from @xmath72 , yielding a schrdinger equation formally equivalent to the one with @xmath76 , whose solution is well - known .",
    "thus , we find that to the first order in @xmath74 we obtain the same spectrum of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions as from , except for a slight correction in the radial coordinate of the wave functions , which has to be multiplied by the factor @xmath77 .",
    "the hamiltonian corresponds to helical oscillations of fixed wavelength @xmath78 . in the final step of our quantization procedure",
    "we shall assume that the system obeys periodic boundary conditions over a length @xmath67 along the @xmath5 axis , so @xmath32 will be restricted to values @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is a positive or negative integer .",
    "thus , the complete vortex hamiltonian is obtained by summing up the expression over all these values of @xmath32 : @xmath81 the above hamiltonian differs from the one of fetter s theory by the presence of the cyclotron modes of frequency @xmath82 ( cf @xcite , equation ( 11 ) ) .",
    "the heat bath hamiltonian is given by , @xmath83 where @xmath84 denotes a creation operator of @xmath6he quasiparticle excitations of momentum @xmath85 and frequency @xmath86 , and @xmath87 denotes a creation operator of solvated @xmath8he atoms of momentum @xmath88 , energy @xmath89 and spin 1/2 projection @xmath90 .",
    "note that we disregard any interaction between the heat bath particles themselves , since we shall work at low enough temperature and impurity concentration , so that such particles remain dilute allowing their treatment as a noninteracting gas .    to model the scattering interaction hamiltonian",
    ", we will consider a generic momentum - conserving form : @xmath91 e^{-i({\\bf k}-{\\bf q})\\cdot{\\bf r}},\\ ] ] where @xmath92 and @xmath93 denote scattering amplitudes depending on the momentum of the heat bath scatterers and the wave vector @xmath94 of the vortex wave .",
    "recalling that the vortex coordinate can be written as @xmath95 and taking into account that @xmath70 and @xmath96 commute , the exponential factor in can be factorized as @xmath97 .",
    "since the amplitude of the vortex wave was assumed to be very small , it is tempting to expand the last two exponentials retaining only first order terms in @xmath96 and @xmath70 .",
    "this procedure was analyzed by fetter @xcite for @xmath70 , finding that it leads to divergences at long wavelengths .",
    "the physical reason for this result can be understood by recalling that @xmath70 is linear in the creation and destruction operators , @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "consequently , an expansion in powers of @xmath70 is bound to fail whenever the energy per quantum @xmath100 becomes very small at long wavelengths , as the transitions should involve many of these  soft \" quanta @xcite .",
    "notice that this argument does not apply to @xmath96 since the operators @xmath101 and @xmath102 correspond to the high - frequency cyclotron quanta .",
    "this means that the treatment of kelvin modes represented by @xmath70 turns out to be considerably more complicated than that of the cyclotron modes represented by @xmath96 .",
    "in fact , only the phonon drag force arising from @xmath70 could be analyzed by fetter @xcite , but we shall see that all sources of friction acting on @xmath96 can be studied . to this aim ,",
    "let us set @xmath103 in while retaining only the first order term in @xmath96 . then , using the second - quantized expression for @xmath96 ( cf ) , performing the integral in @xmath5 and recalling the above - mentioned periodic boundary conditions , the interaction reads @xmath104 \\{\\delta_{k_z , q_z } + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\\pi\\rho_sl}}[i(q_x - k_x)(\\delta_{k , k_z - q_z } a_k^\\dagger + \\delta_{k , q_z - k_z}a_k ) \\nonumber\\\\ + ( q_y - k_y)(\\delta_{k , k_z - q_z } a_k^\\dagger - \\delta_{k , q_z - k_z}a_k)]\\}\\label{p18},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the kronecker - delta factors represent @xmath5-momentum conservation and the scattering amplitudes were assumed to be independent of the sign of @xmath32 , ie the interaction should be the same for both possible directions of a helical deformation .",
    "note that the first term between braces in does not contribute to the interaction , so it should be added to the heat bath hamiltonian .",
    "finally , summing up the expression over @xmath32 we obtain the interaction hamiltonian : @xmath105 \\nonumber\\\\ \\times[i(q_x - k_x)(a_{k_z - q_z}^\\dagger + a_{q_z - k_z } )   + ( q_y - k_y)(a_{k_z - q_z}^\\dagger - a_{q_z - k_z})].\\label{p19}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from and , we may realize that each cyclotron mode of unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath106 will evolve independently , interacting with the heat bath through the following terms of : @xmath107\\ ; [ ( q_y - k_y)+i(q_x - k_x)]a_k^\\dagger\\right.\\nonumber\\\\   + \\left.\\sum _ { { \\bf k } , { \\bf q},\\sigma } ^{(-)}[\\lambda_{{\\bf k }   { \\bf q}}^{(k ) }   \\,b_{{\\bf k}}^\\dagger \\ ,",
    "b _ { { \\bf q } } + \\gamma_{{\\bf k }   { \\bf q}}^{(k)}\\ , c_{{\\bf k},\\sigma}^\\dagger \\ ,   c _ { { \\bf q},\\sigma}]\\ ; [ ( k_y - q_y)+i(q_x - k_x)]a_k\\right\\},\\label{p21}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath108 sign above each summation symbol indicates that only the terms with @xmath109 must be considered .",
    "we recall , however , that for long wavelengths we have @xmath110 @xmath10 , so it will be valid to neglect @xmath32 in such @xmath5-momentum conservation relationships , except at extremely low temperatures ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath112 becomes , @xmath113\\ ; \\{[(q_y - k_y)+i(q_x - k_x)]a_k^\\dagger\\nonumber\\\\   + [ ( k_y - q_y)+i(q_x - k_x)]a_k\\}\\label{p22}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the time evolution of @xmath101 will be ruled by the hamiltonian given by the sum of , and .",
    "to study the time evolution of the vortex coordinate @xmath114 , it will be convenient to use a complex form @xmath115 since @xmath116 is simply written as a linear combination of @xmath117 . in reference",
    "@xcite we studied the cyclotron dynamics of a rigid rectilinear vortex , this being equivalent to considering a single term with @xmath118 in .",
    "we derived , within a weak - coupling approximation , a non - markovian equation of motion for the mean value of the vortex position operator , finding that cyclotron frequency values within the range @xmath119 ps@xmath10 lead to a very good agreement with the experimental determinations of the longitudinal friction coefficient @xmath17 ( equation ) , versus temperature and @xmath8he concentration .",
    "we showed that memory effects could represent up to @xmath120 of the @xmath17 value as the number of heat bath scatterers is increased , that is , such effects are found to be increasing with temperature and impurity concentration .",
    "the scattering amplitudes leading to such results reads as @xcite , @xmath121 where @xmath122 denotes the volume of the system , @xmath123 denotes the quasiparticle group velocity and @xmath124=18.54  , corresponds to an effective cross section for vortex-@xmath8he scattering .",
    "note that these amplitudes are in fact negligible with respect to the heat bath single - particle levels , @xmath125 and @xmath126 , for experimental sizes @xcite and not extremely low temperatures .",
    "the thermal excitation of vortex waves can be made consistent with the above experimental data , if we assume that the scattering amplitudes @xmath92 and @xmath93 in are well approximated by the @xmath127 values , and , respectively .",
    "note that this approximation is similar to the previous one , @xmath128 ( below equation ) and also to @xmath129 in .",
    "thus , each @xmath130 in will present the same dissipative evolution as @xmath131 ie , the same friction coefficient @xmath17 should be ascribed to all long - wavelength cyclotron modes .",
    "this generalizes the previous result @xcite , that the phonon friction coefficient associated to low - frequency kelvin modes turns out to be essentially the same as that of strictly rectilinear vortices .",
    "according to the standard framework of linear response theory @xcite , we will assume that , having the vortex reached thermal equilibrium with the heat bath before @xmath132 , a weak perturbing time dependent scalar field @xmath133 is coupled to the vortex hamiltonian from @xmath132 onward .",
    "then , the hamiltonian of the whole system can be written , @xmath134 where @xmath135 is given by , the vortex hamiltonian is given by , @xmath136 and the interaction hamiltonian is given by , @xmath137\\ ;",

    "as a final remark we note that from the susceptibility @xmath151 , one can readily get the equilibrium time correlation function , @xmath159 via the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite : @xmath160 , \\label{14}\\ ] ] where @xmath161 denotes the fourier transform of @xmath162 .",

    "our calculation of @xmath163 is completely analogous to the one leading to the harmonic oscillator susceptibility in reference @xcite .",

    "the expression for the susceptibility , on the other hand , is fully non - markovian and each pole @xmath176 of it yields a term proportional to @xmath177 in @xmath141 .",
    "then , the markov approximation consists in neglecting the set of such poles which are located far enough from the origin , so that they yield rapidly vanishing terms , ie terms which decay faster than any observational timescale .",

    "notice that @xmath222 in actually corresponds to @xmath223 , as can be easily verified by an elementary calculation of @xmath224 in the canonical ensemble .    to conclude , it is interesting to analyze how the relaxation frequency @xmath225 depends on temperature and impurity concentration . in figure 2 , @xmath226    is plotted against temperature for several @xmath8he concentrations @xcite .",
    "such curves actually correspond to @xmath196 ps@xmath10 , but it is important to remark that the dependence on @xmath43 turns out to be negligible for @xmath43 s within @xmath227 ps@xmath10 or less @xcite .",
    "it is also worth noticing that consistently with our weak - coupling approximation @xcite , the markovian friction coefficient @xmath172 always remains small compared to the coefficient @xmath228 of the magnus force in ( actually @xmath228 has virtually no dependence on temperature for @xmath51 k ) .",
    "the lowest curve in figure 2 corresponds to pure @xmath6he and it displays two well separated regimes @xcite , @xmath229 where @xmath230=8.62 k corresponds to the height of the roton minimum in the dispersion curve of figure 1 . note that the phonon - roton transition clearly manifests itself as an intermediate region of positive second derivative .",
    "the remaining curves in figure 2 correspond to finite @xmath8he concentrations that have been experimentally studied @xcite .",
    "such concentrations are low enough to allow a maxwell - boltzmann approximation for the @xmath8he statistics in .",
    "then , the low - temperature regime of @xmath172 , which is now dominated by impurity scattering , turns out to be proportional to @xmath231 and @xmath8he concentration @xcite .",
    "we may see from figure 2 that phonon effects are completely hidden in ordinary helium , since the @xmath8he domain extends as far as @xmath232 k. for higher concentrations such domain reaches higher temperatures hiding also the first portion of the roton curve .    finally , it is worthwhile observing that relaxation frequencies with any temperature dependence , rarely appear in models of quantal brownian motion of harmonic oscillators , since most of them assume , in contrast to our scattering model , linear couplings in the heat bath operators @xcite .",
    "a generalization of the quantum theory of vortex waves @xcite , has been proposed to study the damping of cyclotron modes .",
    "we have shown that the friction values should be practically unaffected by such oscillations , a result which was already known in the case of phonon scattering of low - frequency kelvin modes @xcite .",
    "all sources of dissipation arising in ordinary helium , viz phonons , rotons and @xmath8he atoms were considered , showing that appreciable memory effects must be taken into account in the evaluation of the friction coefficient .",
    "we have also analyzed memory corrections to the markov approximation in the case of the nonequilibrium energetics of cyclotron modes , finding this time that they are negligible .",
    "we have shown that the vortex response is of the debye type , ie it is ruled by a single relaxation frequency which governs the time correlation function as well .",
    "such a relaxation frequency is shown to embody all the complexity of the heat bath , in that very well separated regimes belonging to the different species comprising the superfluid helium , are recognized from its dependence on temperature and impurity concentration .",
