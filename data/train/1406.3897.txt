    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern generates high energetic proton - proton ( @xmath9 ) collisions with a luminosity of @xmath10 and provides the opportunity to study very high energy physics . at such a high energy , most attention",
    "is usually paid to the central rapidity region where most of the particles are produced and where most of the high @xmath11 signal of new physics is expected .",
    "indeed , the cdf collaboration has already observed such a kind of interesting phenomenon including the exclusive lepton pairs production @xcite@xcite , photon photon production @xcite , dijet production @xcite and charmonium ( @xmath12 ) meson photoproduction @xcite , etc .",
    "now , both atlas and cms collaborations have programs of forward physics which are devoted to studies of high rapidity regions with extra updated detectors located in a place nearly 100 - 400 m close to the interaction point @xcite .",
    "technical details of the atlas forward physics ( afp ) projects can be found , for example , in refs.@xcite .",
    "the physics program of this new instrumentation covers interesting topics like elastic scattering , diffraction , low - x qcd , central exclusive production ( cep ) and the photon - photon ( @xmath1 ) interaction , the last two being the main motivation for the afp project .",
    "cep is a class of processes in which the two interacting protons are not destroyed during the collision but survive into the final state with additional particle states .",
    "protons of this kind are named intact or forward protons .",
    "this is a rare interaction and can take place through strong effects like pomeron exchange or electromagnetic effects , i.e. , via photon exchange .",
    "the kinematics of a forward proton is often described by means of the reduced energy loss @xmath13 : @xmath14 where e is the initial energy of the beam , @xmath15 is the energy after the interaction and @xmath16 is the energy that the proton lost in the interaction . for cep ,",
    "the simple approximate relation between the reduced energy losses of both protons ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) and the mass of the centrally produced system m is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the square of the centre - of - mass energy .",
    "the simplest exclusive production is due to the exchange of two photons : @xmath21 where x is the centrally produced system . in such production at the lhc",
    ", the invariant mass of the photons can span up to 1 tev scales , high enough to reach scales of possible new physics .",
    "in addition , the production of these processes mainly through the qed mechanisms which are well understood and their predictions have a very small uncertainty . these make the two - photon exchange physics particularly interesting .",
    "therefore , we can use this kind of production mechanism to determine the luminosity at the lhc precisely@xcite , to study the interaction of electroweak bosons with over - constrained kinematics , to test the standard model ( sm ) at high energies or to study the new production channels that could appear , i.e. , susy@xcite , anomalous gauge couplings@xcite , unparticle@xcite and extra dimensions@xcite , etc .",
    "observing light - by - light scattering at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) has received quite some attention@xcite and it is believed a clean and sensitive channel to possible new physics . in this paper , we study the diphoton signal from graviton exchange in the large extra dimension ( led ) model via the main reaction @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the kk graviton in led .",
    "a similar study has been performed in ref.@xcite where the authors study the diphoton signal in both the led and randall - sundrum ( rs ) models and take @xmath1 sm production as the corresponding background . in our study we also consider the double pomeron exchange ( dpe ) production of the diphoton and present their cross section dependence on the energy loss of the proton @xmath13 and compare its production separately in the quark - quark collision mode to the gluon - gluon collision mode . our paper is organized as follows : we build the calculation framework in sect .",
    "2 including a brief introduction to the central exclusive diphoton production and equivalent photon approximation ( epa ) , the general diphoton exchange process cross section and a brief introduction to the led model .",
    "section 3 is arranged to present the input parameters and numerical results of our study .",

    "when the invariant mass of system x ( @xmath25 ) produced in the two - photon process is not too small , we can factorize the amplitudes for the interaction @xmath26 and introduce equivalent photon fluxes which play a similar role to the parton density functions for the hadron interactions .",
    "this is indeed the basis of the equivalent photon approximation ( epa)@xcite , and it allows us to calculate the proton cross section as the photon cross section plus two equivalent photon fluxes .",
    "two quasi - real photons emitted by each proton interact with each other to produce x : @xmath26 . deflected protons and their energy loss",

    "this is described by the epa mentioned above which differs from the point - like electron ( positron ) case by taking care of the electromagnetic form factors in the equivalent @xmath31 spectrum and effective @xmath31 luminosity : @xmath32\\ ] ] with @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the fine - structure constant , e is the energy of the incoming proton beam . which is related to the quasi - real photon energy by @xmath35 .",

    "the hierarchy problem strongly suggests the existence of new physics beyond the sm at tev scale@xcite . the idea that there exist extra dimensions ( ed ) which was first proposed by arkani - hamed , dimopoulos , and dvali@xcite , might provide a solution to this problem .",
    "they proposed a scenario in which the sm field is constrained to the common 3 + 1 space - time dimensions ( `` brane '' ) , while gravity is free to propagate throughout a larger multidimensional space @xmath65 ( `` bulk '' ) .",
    "the picture of a massless graviton propagating in d dimensions is equal to the picture that numerous massive kaluza - klein ( kk ) gravitons propagate in four dimensions .",
    "the fundamental planck scale @xmath66 is related to the planck mass scale @xmath67 according to the formula @xmath68 , where r and @xmath69 are the size and number of the extra dimensions , respectively .",
    "if r is large enough to make @xmath66 on the order of the electroweak symmetry breaking scale ( @xmath70 ) , the hierarchy problem will be naturally solved , so this extra dimension model is called the large extra dimension model ( led ) or the add model .",
    "postulating @xmath66 to be 1 tev , we get @xmath71 for @xmath72 , which is obviously ruled out since it would modify newton s law of gravity at solar - system distances ; and we get @xmath73 for @xmath74 , which is also ruled out by torsion - balance experiments@xcite . when @xmath75 , where @xmath76 , it is possible to detect a graviton signal at high energy colliders .    at colliders ,",
    "the exchange of a virtual kk graviton or the emission of a real kk mode could give rise to interesting phenomenological signals at tev scale@xcite .",

    "now we give the analytical calculations of the process @xmath83 at the lhc in the led model . in our calculation",
    "we use the de donder gauge .",
    "the relevant feynman rules involving a graviton in the led model can be found in ref.@xcite .",

    "the spin-0 states only couple through the dilaton modes , which have no contribution to @xmath1 processes .",

    "for the formulas and details we refer to the two original calculations@xcite for more details . inserting the amplitudes into eqs.([totcrosssection ] ) and ( [ partoiccrosssection ] ) we can obtain the total cross section .",

    "is taken to be 0.9 for central diphoton exchange and 0.03 for dpe processes@xcite .",
    "in all the results present in our work , we impose a cut of pseudorapidity @xmath27 for the final state particles since central detectors of the atlas and cms have a pseudorapidity @xmath118 coverage of 2.5 .",
    "the general acceptance cuts for all the signal and background events are @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the separation in the rapidity - azimuth plane and @xmath11 is the transverse momentum of the photons .",
    "our signal topology is simply that of two photons in the final states excited by graviton exchange .",
    "the main background comes from two sources : one is the background coming from sm @xmath0 production through one - loop contributions .",
    "the other comes from diffractive double pomeron exchange ( dpe ) [ or central exclusive diffractive ( ced ) production ] of the diphoton .",
    "let us first consider the sm @xmath83 one - loop production .",
    "though there is no tree level contribution to @xmath121 , it is still important to include loop effects of its contributions .",
    "the precise determination of this cross section has a special importance to test the renormalization procedure of the parts of the sm containing w gauge bosons .",

    "now let us see the background contributions from dpe or ced productions .",
    "different from ref.@xcite where one takes the sm @xmath1 production as the only background , here we also consider the dpe backgrounds .",
    "however , their results are for @xmath7 , where in this range , dpe indeed is small and not very important .",
    "but for the other choice of the forward detector acceptance it might be interesting to study them . in dpe , two colorless objects are emitted from both protons .",
    "their partonic components are resolved and create a heavy mass object x in the central detector in the pomeron - pomeron interaction .",
    "the event is characterized by two rapidity gaps between the central object and the protons . through the exchange of two pomerons a dijet system , a diphoton system ,",
    "a ww and zz pair , or a drell - yan pair can be created for instance . the dpe production cross section can be obtained within the factorized ingelman - schlein@xcite . in the ingelman - schlein model",
    ", one assumes that the pomeron has a well - defined partonic structure , and that the hard process takes place in a pomeron - proton or proton - pomeron ( single diffraction ) or pomeron - pomeron ( central diffraction ) processes .",
    "these processes are described in terms of the proton `` diffractive '' parton distribution functions ( dpdfs ) .",
    "similar to the parton distribution functions , the dpdfs are also obtained from deep inelastic scattering experiments@xcite .",
    "the difference is that they contain a dependence on additional variables describing the proton kinematics : the relative energy loss @xmath13 and four - momentum transfer t , which we introduce as @xmath122 where @xmath123 denotes either the quark or the gluon distributions with d refers to `` diffractive '' .",
    "@xmath124 is the flux of the pomerons and is expressed as @xmath125 with @xmath126 and @xmath127 being kinematic boundaries .",
    "@xmath128 is the partonic structure of the pomeron .",
    "@xmath129 here is the fraction of the proton momentum carried by the pomeron corresponding to the relative energy loss @xmath13 and @xmath130 is the fraction of the pomeron momentum carried by the struck parton .",
    "both pomeron flux factors @xmath131 as well as quark and gluon distributions in the pomeron @xmath132 were taken from the h1 collaboration analysis of the diffractive structure function at hera@xcite .",
    "therefore , the final forward detector acceptance s @xmath13-dependent convolution integral for the dpe production is given by @xmath133 diffraction usually dominates for @xmath134 which means that we can replace @xmath135 by 0.05 directly .",
    "we check this and find the difference is quite small , as expected .",
    "the dpe production cross section should be multiplied by the gap survival probability s=0.03 for lhc .",
    "this is different for @xmath1 exchange where s=0.9 and single diffractive production with s=0.6@xcite .",
    "we separate the dpe background contributions into three different parts based on different parton - collision modes include @xmath136 , @xmath137 and gg .",
