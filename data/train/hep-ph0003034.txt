    "in 1930 , after inferring the existence of the neutrino from the continuous electron spectrum of nuclear @xmath0-decay , w.  pauli remarked @xcite , `` i have done a terrible thing .",
    "i have postulated a particle that can not be detected . ''",
    "twenty - three years later , f.  reines and c.  l.  cowan @xcite reported the first detection of neutrinos via inverse @xmath0-decay .    encouraged by these events , the propensity of history to repeat itself , and a steady stream of positive experimental data , contemporary particle physicists and astrophysicists",
    "have recently explored the ramifications of so - called `` sterile '' neutrinos , denoted @xmath1 .",
    "the existence of such standard model - singlet fermions , which couple to the conventional ( or `` active '' ) neutrinos @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 solely through effective mass terms , is implied by the confluence of several neutrino oscillation experiments :    * * atmospheric neutrinos *  the super - kamiokande collaboration has reported convincing evidence for the suppression of the flux of @xmath3 and @xmath5 produced by cosmic ray collisions with the earth s upper atmosphere @xcite .",
    "( the measured flux of @xmath2 and @xmath6 is within expectation . ) in particular , there is a statistically significant zenith angle dependence of the high energy muon - like events which is consistent with neutrino oscillations . a two - neutrino vacuum mixing fit yields @xmath7 and @xmath8",
    ", if the neutrino mixing maximally with @xmath3 is @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "there are also matter - enhanced ( mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein or msw @xcite ) solutions @xmath9 and @xmath10 if the mixing partner is @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "channel over @xmath11 @xcite . ] * * solar neutrinos *  an array of solar neutrino experiments @xcite has observed an energy - dependent deficit of @xmath2 emitted by nuclear reactions in the sun .",
    "the kamiokande and super - kamiokande experiments observe about one - half of the expected flux of the highest energy solar neutrinos .",
    "the homestake chlorine experiment , sensitive to intermediate and higher energy neutrinos , sees approximately one - third of the expected flux .",
    "further , the soviet / russian - american gallium experiment ( sage ) and gallex record roughly one - half of the expected flux integrated over nearly the entire solar spectrum . the combined result is a distorted spectrum which is extremely difficult to reconcile with the standard solar model .",
    "global two - neutrino fits to these observations yield @xcite the large angle ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) and small angle ( @xmath12 , @xmath14 ) msw solutions and the `` just - so '' vacuum oscillation solution ( @xmath15 , @xmath10 ) .",
    "the neutrino mixing with @xmath2 may be @xmath3 , @xmath4 , or @xmath1 , depending on the solution . * * accelerator neutrinos *  the los alamos liquid scintillator neutrino detector ( lsnd ) experiment has recorded an excess of @xmath2 and @xmath6 events in accelerator - produced beams of @xmath3 and @xmath5 respectively @xcite .",
    "there are several allowed regions in the oscillation parameter space , all of which fall in the ranges @xmath16 and @xmath17 , assuming two - neutrino mixing .",
    "the agreement @xcite between the regions for the neutrino ( @xmath18 ) and antineutrino ( @xmath19 ) channels reinforces the oscillation interpretation .",
    "the karlsruhe rutherford medium energy neutrino ( karmen ) experiment has searched for excess events in the same channels @xcite , and despite a null result , a joint analysis of the karmen and lsnd data preserves some of the lsnd solution space @xcite .",
    "the mutual incompatibility of these disparate sets of results is _ prima facie _ evidence for the existence of a _ light _",
    "sterile neutrino @xmath1 , since the number of light weakly interacting neutrino species is known to be three ( namely , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 ) @xcite , an effectively three - neutrino mass matrix yields at most two independent @xmath20 s , and the active neutrinos are known to be very light compared to their charged leptonic counterparts .",
    "global fits of the data to three - neutrino mass matrices have borne out this conclusion , and several authors have indicated how to accommodate all of the data in a four - neutrino mixing matrix @xcite .    assuming that the current data is explained by oscillations and that future neutrino experiments confirm the reality of an additional light neutrino species , a number of workers have begun constructing theoretical models which yield the naturally small dirac _ and _ majorana neutrino masses required for appreciable active - sterile neutrino mixing . some of these models are generalizations of the traditional see - saw mechanism @xcite for generating light active neutrinos in the presence of very heavy sterile neutrinos @xcite .",
    "others involve restricted or extended couplings in the context of the standard model ( sm ) @xcite .",
    "many methods rely on new symmetries to ensure that both active and sterile neutrino masses are small and comparable .",
    "all of them can be classified as simple extensions of the sm gauge group and matter content ( including grand unified theories or guts ) , supersymmetric models , or superstring - inspired scenarios .",
    "the phenomenological consequences and uses of sterile neutrinos are equally interesting .",
    "in particular , resonant transitions among active and sterile neutrinos can alter significantly the dynamics of early universe cosmology and various astrophysical venues .",
    "indeed , significant consequences are almost guaranteed in phenomena such as big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) and core - collapse supernovae , whose outcome is determined or dominated by neutrino physics .",
    "transitions to and from sterile neutrinos can distort severely the active neutrinos energy spectra , resulting , for example , in nucleosynthetic abundances markedly different from the commonly accepted values .",
    "these effects are not invariably unfavorable .",
    "indeed , sterile neutrinos have been variously invoked to explain the origin of pulsar kicks @xcite , provide a new dark matter candidate @xcite , account for the diffuse ionization in the milky way galaxy @xcite , resolve the `` crisis '' in bbn @xcite , and help enable the synthesis of heavy elements in type ii supernovae @xcite .",
    "in these proceedings , we describe the interesting phenomenological implications of two of these scenarios .",
    "we recapitulate in sec . ii the physics of sterile neutrino dark matter , concentrating on the production of the cold , non - thermal variety . in sec .",
    "iii , we summarize our recent work on and the status of matter - enhanced active - sterile neutrino transformation solutions to heavy - element nucleosynthesis .",
    "we give conclusions in sec .",
    "the number of suitable candidates for the dark matter of the universe is staggering ! in eq .",
    "( [ omegatotal ] ) we have listed some of the possible constituents  without regard to their potential mutual exclusivity  of the total mass - energy of the universe ( measured as a fraction @xmath21 of the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) closure energy density ) :",
    "@xmath22    the astute reader will have noticed the addition of sterile neutrino dark matter to this list . if one light sterile species @xmath1 is required by the neutrino oscillation experiments , then the multi - generational structure of the sm argues strongly in favor of two additional steriles @xmath23 and @xmath24 . while more massive than their lighter sibling , these additional neutrinos could also have relatively small masses which are easily compatible with the data .    if there is a @xmath23 in the 200 ev to 10 kev mass range and a primordial lepton number @xmath25 in any of the active neutrino flavors , shi & fuller @xcite have shown that this asymmetry can drive resonant production of sterile neutrino dark matter in the early universe .",
    "furthermore , since the msw mechanism in this environment favors efficient conversion from active to sterile neutrinos only for the lowest energy neutrinos and the process itself destroys lepton number , the resulting @xmath23 spectrum is non - thermal and essentially `` cold . ''",
    "unlike conventional neutrino dark matter ( hot dark matter or hdm ) , this cold dark matter ( cdm ) candidate has a relatively short free - streaming length at the epoch of structure formation , so density fluctuations may grow unimpeded on galactic scales .",
    "for example , a @xmath26 ev sterile neutrino can contribute a fraction @xmath27 to the critical density and stream freely over only @xmath28 mpc , which corresponds to a structure cut - off @xmath29 , about the size of dwarf galaxies .",
    "for further details , please consult ref .",
    "what is the origin of the heavy elements ? the light elements ( h , he , d , and li ) are produced ( for the most part ) in the early universe and the intermediate mass elements ( up to fe ) during the `` main sequence '' evolution of stars , but the source of at least half of the nuclides heavier than iron is unknown .",
    "it is not difficult to understand why ordinary stellar evolution can not produce nuclei more massive than iron .",
    "the thermonuclear processes which take place in stellar interiors work gradually from hydrogen toward iron by fusing together ever heavier nuclei .",
    "since these thermal reactions can proceed only if the products are more tightly bound than the reactants , the path of stellar nucleosynthesis ends at iron , which is the most tightly bound nucleus .",
    "it is clear , then , that elements heavier than iron must form via some other process(es ) in some other environment(s ) .",
    "one pathway from iron to heavy nuclides such as plutonium , iodine , tin , lead , and gold is the * r*-process , so named because it proceeds via the * r*apid capture of neutrons on iron - sized `` seed '' nuclei . in the r - process ,",
    "seed nuclei capture neutrons so rapidly that they can leap past iron on the curve of binding energy versus atomic mass . after the r - process is complete , the now extremely neutron - rich nuclei @xmath0-decay to more stable elements on the periodic table , yielding some mass distribution of nuclides . in all but extreme astrophysical environments ,",
    "a key necessary condition for a successful r - process is a preponderance of neutrons over protons , as the heavy elements are quite neutron - rich .",
    "once seed nuclei are available for neutron capture to proceed , this requirement becomes having a large number of free neutrons for each seed nucleus .",
    "although the physics of the r - process is relatively well - known , the astrophysical environment in which it takes place has not been determined conclusively .",
    "the major contenders include type ii ( or core - collapse ) supernovae and binary neutron star mergers .",
    "the former is currently the most promising r - process site , and we now restrict ourselves to a discussion of supernova physics and how non - standard particle physics like neutrino oscillations can help enable the r - process .    a type ii supernova results from the catastrophic gravitational collapse of a massive star @xcite . specifically , a star with mass @xmath30 burns successively heavier fuels throughout its life , eventually accumulating an inner iron core . as indicated above",
    ", thermal fusion processes can not extract energy from iron to provide pressure support against gravity , so the core eventually collapses under its own gravity .",
    "abetted by the photodissociation of the iron nuclei , the core rapidly neutronizes via electron capture on protons . when the central core density reaches the saturation density of nuclear matter , the nucleons touch , and the core `` bounces , '' yielding an outgoing shockwave .",
    "unfortunately , the shock wave eventually dies out , as it loses all of its energy dissociating the mantle of the star .",
    "meanwhile , however , thermally produced neutrinos , trapped in the dense core , diffuse out and revive the shock ( the supernova explodes ! ) .",
    "the remaining neutrinos continue to leak out on a time scale of some 10 - 20 seconds , driving significant mass loss from the newly formed proto - neutron star .",
    "it is in this neutrino - driven `` wind ''",
    "@xcite that the r - process is believed to occur @xcite .",
    "the hot proto - neutron star emits neutrinos of all flavors , with average energies @xmath31 , where @xmath32 refers to the muon and tau neutrinos , and comparable luminosities .",
    "they stream nearly freely through a plasma of electrons , positrons , neutrons , and protons . by exchanging energy with the cooler plasma ,",
    "the neutrinos drive the r - process ingredients out of the gravitational potential well of the neutron star . as a fluid element of this neutrino - heated ejecta",
    "travels away from the surface of the star , its temperature gradually drops , its velocity increases , and the following sequence ensues :    * the reactions + @xmath33 + set the ratio @xmath34 of the number densities of neutrons and protons . contribute only negligibly to @xmath34 for the relevant neutrino energies . ]",
    "this number is usually written in terms of the electron fraction @xmath35 , the net number of electrons per baryon .",
    "charge neutrality of the plasma gives @xmath36 .",
    "thus a higher ( lower ) @xmath34 corresponds to a lower ( higher ) @xmath35 .",
    "the reactions in eqs .",
    "( 2 - 3 ) freeze out at a temperature @xmath37 , when their rates fall below the local expansion rate .",
    "* when the plasma cools to @xmath38 , @xmath39-particles ( @xmath40 nuclei ) start to form from the ambient neutrons and protons .",
    "* at lower plasma temperatures , some of the @xmath39-particles combine via three - body interactions into seed nuclei with mass number @xmath41 .",
    "* finally , at sufficiently low temperatures ( @xmath42 mev ) , the r - process occurs .    unfortunately , detailed numerical simulations @xcite have found that the r - process is _ precluded _ in neutrino - heated ejecta by a phenomenon termed the `` @xmath39-effect . ''",
    "the @xmath39-effect occurs when nucleons are taken up into @xmath39-particles , leaving nearly inert @xmath40 nuclei and excess neutrons ( the plasma is already neutron - rich ) .",
    "since the @xmath2 flux is still sizable in the region beyond freeze - out , the forward reaction in eq .",
    "( 2 ) proceeds to convert the leftover neutrons into protons .",
    "these protons and remaining neutrons quickly form additional @xmath39-particles before the forward reaction in eq .",
    "( 3 ) can reconvert the newly - formed protons .",
    "ultimately , nearly all of the free neutrons end up in @xmath40 nuclei , the electron fraction is driven to 0.5 , and the final neutron - to - seed ratio is too small to give even an anemic r - process !    we have shown in fig .",
    "1 the radial evolution of the electron fraction in the hot , high - entropy `` bubble '' above the proto - neutron star . we have used a simple model @xcite for the wind and taken representative values of the neutron star radius ( @xmath43 ) , expansion time scale ( @xmath44 ) , entropy per baryon ( @xmath45 ) , and neutrino spectral parameters @xcite .",
    "the @xmath39-effect begins when the temperature in the plasma drops to @xmath46 .",
    "comparison of the behavior with and without the @xmath39-effect illustrates its negative impact .",
    "0.5 cm    various calculations @xcite have shown that this problem persists for all reasonable variations in wind outflow and neutrino spectral parameters .",
    "since there is mounting evidence @xcite that the r - process must occur in neutrino - heated ejecta in type ii supernovae , a number of authors @xcite have attempted to circumvent the @xmath39-effect in order to enable heavy - element nucleosynthesis .",
    "the high neutron - to - seed ratio requirement for a successful r - process is met if @xmath35 is sufficiently small ( @xmath47 corresponds to neutron - rich ejecta ) ; the expansion rate of the ejecta is sufficiently high that the three - body reactions making seed nuclei are inefficient ; and/or the entropy of the plasma is high enough that nucleons prefer to remain free rather than bound in nuclei @xcite . increasing the expansion rate will not redress the @xmath39-effect , since @xmath39-particles form via relatively fast two - body processes . raising the entropy in the ejecta substitutes for the @xmath39-effect another process which decimates the neutron - to - seed ratio : neutrino neutral current spallation of @xmath40 nuclei @xcite .",
    "since the severity of the effect depends on the @xmath2 flux in the region of @xmath39-particle production , lowering @xmath35 without changing the @xmath2 flux also can not help enable the r - process .",
    "7.0 truein    0.5 cm    non - standard neutrino physics such as neutrino oscillations is an elegant solution to this problem , for resonant transformation between @xmath2 and some other species can directly influence the @xmath2 flux .",
    "given the hierarchy of the energies of the active neutrinos , matter - enhanced transformation between @xmath2 and @xmath3 or @xmath4 will actually enhance the @xmath39-effect .",
    "transformations among the active antineutrinos will affect only @xmath6 .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , however , various neutrino experiments imply the existence of a sterile neutrino which mixes appreciably with the active neutrinos .",
    "as long as the neutron star emits a negligible number of sterile neutrinos , effective active - sterile mixing in the form of @xmath48 and @xmath49 has the potential to forestall the @xmath39-effect by removing the offending @xmath2 s @xcite .    the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite and we @xcite have recently investigated this mixing scheme in neutrino - heated ejecta . shown in fig",
    "1 is the evolution of @xmath35 with radius for a representative set of mixing parameters . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors included all contributions to the effective mass @xcite of electron neutrinos except neutrino forward scattering on the `` background '' of other neutrinos emitted by the neutron star @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have also included this many - body effect .",
    "the behavior of @xmath35 for both analyses is indicated in the figure , both with and without the @xmath39-effect . in fig .",
    "2 , we have shown final electron fraction attained ( at @xmath50 in fig .",
    "1 ) without neutrino background effects .    in the absence of the neutrino background ,",
    "active - sterile mixing is a viable solution to the r - process problem . for a relatively large range of neutrino mixing parameters ,",
    "the final electron fraction is less than 0.3 , yielding a highly neutron - rich r - process environment . calculations with various choices of the outflow and neutrino spectral parameters have confirmed that this is also a _ robust _",
    "solution @xcite : a high neutron - to - seed ratio obtains for a wide range of supernova and mixing parameters .",
    "an additional benefit is that the @xmath20-@xmath51 region favored for enabling the r - process coincides with one of the four - neutrino mixing schemes explaining the current experiments @xcite .",
    "the presence of the neutrino background unfortunately mitigates this remedy , but the background gradually dies away as neutrinos diffuse out of the neutron star . at sufficiently late times",
    "after the supernova bounce and explosion , the probability of neutrino - neutrino forward scattering is sufficiently small that the scenario of ref .",
    "@xcite prevails . at these times",
    ", however , the neutrino fluxes have fallen sufficiently that there may not be a need for neutrino transformation to relieve the @xmath39-effect .",
    "if the total neutron - rich mass ejected at late times is sufficient to account for all of the r - process material in the galaxy , then there is no need to invoke non - standard neutrino physics . settling this issue",
    "requires a self - consistent calculation of the wind coupled with neutrino oscillations and including neutrino background effects . on the other hand ,",
    "if future experiments conclusively establish the existence of a light sterile neutrino in the mass range relevant for type ii supernovae , active - sterile mixing may have profound consequences for the synthesis of the heavy elements .",
    "the present solar , atmospheric , and accelerator neutrino experiments suggest the existence of a light sterile neutrino . while this is a radical departure from the folklore that sterile neutrinos ( if they exist ) are very heavy , future experiments @xcite may confirm their reality and force theorists to modify or discard cherished models of neutrino mass . as we have indicated in this paper ,",
    "the mixing of sterile and active neutrinos has potentially far - reaching consequences for cosmology and astrophysics .",
    "they may account for much of the dark matter of the universe",
    ". they may even be the reason why we have gold rings , tin cans , atomic bombs , and lead shielding !",
