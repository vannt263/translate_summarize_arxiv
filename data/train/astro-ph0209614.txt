    "in the past few decades , the existence has been shown of galaxies with a blue central disc surface brightness well below the freeman value of @xmath0=21.65 mag arcsec@xmath1 , which is typical of the average previously catalogued `` classical '' high surface brightness spirals ( hsbs ) . particularily in the last decade a considerable body of observational data has been collected on this class of low surface brightness galaxies ( lsbs ) , which may turn out to be crucial to studies of galaxy formation and evolution and of the ` cosmic ' chemical evolution , if ( as suggested by oneil & bothun 2000 ) they represent the majority of galaxies .    although there is no unambiguous definition of an lsb galaxy , we adopted as the limit between hsbs and lsbs a blue central disc surface brightness value of @xmath0=22 mag arcsec@xmath2 , a commonly used criterion .    though lsbs show a large variety of observed properties ( see below ) ,",
    "their obvious interest has motivated various theoretical studies towards an understanding of their nature . in a recent series of papers , the chemical and spectro - photometric evolution of `` classical '' hsb spiral galaxies",
    "was computed ( for various galactic masses and angular momentum ) and compared quite successfully to various types of observational quantities like colours , spectrum , star formation efficiency and gas fraction as well as to their tully - fisher relationship ( boissier & prantzos 1999,2000 ; boissier et al .",
    "2001 ; see also prantzos et al . ,",
    "this volume ) .",
    "these models have now been extended to cover lsbs ( boissier et al .",
    "2002 , and this volume ) , based on the suggestion of dalcanton et al .",
    "( 1997 ) that lsbs have a larger angular momentum than hsbs , as used also by jimenez et al .",
    "( 1998 ) in their models .",
    "observations have shown a large variety of lsb galaxies , from dwarfs to giants and from `` blue '' to the red edge of galactic colours , which indicates that they form a heterogeneous family . in our models",
    "we explore a possible link between hsb and lsb discs , without an _ a priori _ idea of which of the lsbs should actually be linked to hsbs .",
    "we therefore have to consider the whole range of lsbs , which can be achieved by the use of the following data sets available in the literature . for each sample",
    "at least detailed surface photometry , colours and 21 cm hi line spectra should be available .    _",
    "oneil et al .",
    "lsbs sample _ : the data from oneil et al .",
    "( 1997a , b ) provide information on the surface brightness , scale - length , absolute magnitude of the disc and colours for 127 lsbs , 80 % of which are well fitted by an exponential profile , justifying the use of a disc - model for studying lsbs .",
    "these data showed that a large fraction of lsbs were redder than previously thought .",
    "hi data for subsets are given in oneil et al .",
    "( 2000a ) and chung et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . some objects are members of clusters ( pegasus and cancer )",
    ".    _ de blok et al .",
    "lsbs sample _ : for 21 late - type field lsbs de blok et al .",
    "( 1995 ) published disc scale - lengths , absolute magnitudes and colours , while for subsets interferometric hi data are given in de blok et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , abundances in de blok & van der hulst ( 1998a ) , co line upper limits in de blok & van der hulst ( 1998b ) and h@xmath3 rotation curves in mcgaugh et al .",
    "their gas content is also available from van den hoek et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .    _ bulge - dominated lsbs sample _ : although most lsbs seem to be late - type objects without any apparent bulge , some of them clearly do have bulges , and we should not exclude these from our analysis , to avoid introducing a bias against the most evolved lsb discs .",
    "for this reason , we also use the sample of 20 lsbs from beijersbergen et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .    _ giant lsbs sample _ : we used the data of matthews et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , which provides surface photometry and hi spectra for 16 giant lsb galaxies , with high luminosities ( 10@xmath4 l@xmath5 ) and large scale - lengths ( @xmath6 kpc ) .",
    "though lsb giants are relatively rare , they may play an important role in our investigation of the link between hsbs and lsbs because of their similar sizes / velocities ( note that there are many more hsbs with large line widths than with small ones , like for lsbs ) .",
    "_ infrared - selected lsbs sample _ : a new sample of lsbs selected from the 2mass near - infrared survey ( monnier ragaigne et al .",
    "2002 ) is used as well . though these 4,000 objects were selected on their low @xmath7 band central disc surface brightness ,",
    "@xmath8@xmath918 mag arcsec@xmath2 , they turned out to be bluer than expected and their @xmath10 band central disc surface brightness lies in the range of @xmath1121 - 22.5 mag arcsec@xmath2 , around the optical selection criterion for lsbs we adopted . here",
    ", we use the subset of 20 galaxies for which we presently have available @xmath12 surface photometry , hi spectra and @xmath13 photometry .",
    "this sample allows the exploration of the link between optically hsb and lsb galaxies , as can be seen in figure 1 , where has been labelled as mr2002 .    because the data come from various sources , we have homogenised them for a proper comparison with our disc models , as follows : ( 1 ) all distance - dependent quantities were corrected to a hubble constant of 65 km / s / mpc ; ( 2 ) the data were corrected to face - on , i=0@xmath14 , assuming lsb discs to be optically thin , which seems justified by the fact that their colours are independent of inclination ( e.g. oneil et al .",
    "1997a ) ; ( 3 ) the absolute total disc magnitudes , @xmath15 , are deduced from an exponential fit to the exponential profiles ( e.g. oneil et al .",
    "1997a ) , and ( 4 ) the total gas mass is obtained by correcting the hi mass for the helium fraction ( @xmath16/@xmath17=1.4 ) .",
    "the molecular component in lsbs is generally negligible , though a number have now been detected in co ( matthews & gao 2001 ; oneil et al . 2000b , and references therein ) .    the large diversity between , and among , the lsbs in these samples is obvious from the plots shown in figure 1 .",
    "though most properties can be fitted with our  simple  models , which have a smoothly changing star formation rate over time , in order to explain the wide range in colours , especially the red objects in the oneil et al .",
    "sample , star bursts and truncations need to be added to the star formation history of the `` simple '' models ( boissier et al . ,",
    "this volume ) .",
