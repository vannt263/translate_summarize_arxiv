    "to do this we use a bayesian detection scheme similar to that reported in @xcite . from the number of photons collected in a given detection time step , we update the probability that the ion is in a bright state via @xmath19 where @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) is the conditional probability the ion is in a bright ( dark ) state given @xmath22 photons , @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) is the conditional probability of getting @xmath22 photons given the ion is in a bright ( dark ) state , and @xmath25 ( ( @xmath26 ) ) is the current probability the ion is in the bright ( dark ) state .",

    "even an error rate of @xmath95 in a detection time would result in a significant contribution to the measured rate .",

    "we used an artificial background to match the photon count rate of a bright ion to determine the contribution of the measured rate from detection errors .",
    "out of @xmath99 events we obtained an average detection time of 6 ms with no errors found .",
    "this bounds the contribution to @xmath100/s which is well below the statistical uncertainty .",
    "decay out of the detection channel is dominated by decays from to and . in two separate experiments ,",
    "we determine the contribution from each of these decays by repumping using either 350 or 622 after the ion is confirmed dark and measure the fraction returning to the bright state . from these measurements and the branching ratios determined in section  [ 3p1measurements ] the percentage of decays going to and are 0.497(19 ) and 0.562(30 ) respectively .",
