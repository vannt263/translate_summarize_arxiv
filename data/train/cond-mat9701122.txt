    "several infinite - range models for disorder - free glassiness have been proposed;@xcite the majority were studied via a mapping to intrinsically random systems.@xcite this approach relies on the observation that certain infinite - range periodic and random models have identical leading order ( in @xmath5 ) high - temperature expansions .",

    "response to a small time - varying field in the fabricated array should probe its diverging relaxation time at the glass transition.@xcite in this paper we study the behavior of this periodic network in its low - temperature non - ergodic regime .",

    "here @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the temperatures associated with the dynamical instability , `` superheating '' , and a speculated equilibrium transition as discussed in the text .",
    "the system of our study is a stack of two mutually perpendicular sets of @xmath8 parallel thin superconducting wires with josephson junctions at each node ( figure 1 ) that is placed in an external tranverse field @xmath12 .",
    "the classical thermodynamic variables of this array are the @xmath0 superconducting phases associated with each wire . in the absence of an external field",
    "the phase differences would be zero at each junction , but this is not possible for finite @xmath12 and the phases are thus frustrated .",
    "here we assume that the josephson couplings are sufficiently small so that the induced fields are negligible in comparison with @xmath12 , an important point for the experimental realization of this network.@xcite we can therefore describe the array by the hamiltonian = - _ m , n^2n s_m^ * j_mn s_n [ h ] where @xmath13 is the coupling matrix = (    cc 0 & + ^ & 0    ) [ j ] with @xmath14 and @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the index of the horizontal ( vertical ) wires ; @xmath17 where the @xmath18 are the superconducting phases of the @xmath0 wires . here we have introduced the flux per unit strip , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the inter - node spacing and @xmath21 is the flux quantum ; the normalization has been chosen so that @xmath9 does not scale with @xmath8 .    because every horizontal ( vertical ) wire is linked to every vertical ( horizontal ) wire , the connectivity in this model is high ( @xmath8 ) and it is accessible to a mean - field treatment.@xcite for @xmath22 there exist an extensive number of metastable solutions separated by barriers that scale@xcite with @xmath8 . a similar long - range network with disorder was previously found to display a spin glass transition@xcite for @xmath23 ; in the absence of short - range phase coherence between wires @xmath24 )",

    ", we can not exclude the possibility that at low temperatures a single low - lying state appears ; however it seems very likely that even in this case it will be irrelevant because the system is trapped in one of the many metastable glassy states .",
    "furthermore we have not observed such states in our direct numerical simulations of @xmath29 array .    in the thermodynamic limit of @xmath30 ( with fixed area ) ,",
    "the system is accessible to a static and dynamical high - temperature study;@xcite this was performed using a modified tap method.@xcite this will be discussed in more detail when the coupled dynamical equations are derived in section ii ; at temperatures above the dynamic instability the system is still in equilibrium and these equations can be solved analytically .",
    "the glass transition is characterized by a diverging relaxation time and a jump in the edwards - anderson order parameter , and does _ not _ coincide with an accompanying static transition .",
    "this calculated glass transition temperature ( @xmath9 ) assumes that cooling from high temperatures occurs infinitesmally slowly ; in practice , the system s effective glass transition temperature ( @xmath31 ) will correspond to the system s failure to equilibrate and will be a function of its finite cooling time - scale . for the sake of notational simplicity , we will not distinguish between the effective and the `` adiabatic '' glass transition temperature in the text that follows unless explicitly stated .",
    "below the glass transition temperature ( @xmath9 ) , the system can no longer equilibrate .",
    "in contrast to the situation for @xmath32 , the response and the correlation functions are _ not _ a function of time differences but rather are history - dependent ; furthermore we can no longer relate them with the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "this makes the solution of these equations rather complicated .",
    "the low - temperature state of the system is determined by the sample history ; here we shall consider the simplest scenario in which the temperature is reduced linearly from an initial @xmath33 slightly above @xmath9 to a final temperature @xmath34 ) in a time @xmath35 .",
    "the final state of the system at time @xmath36 is controlled by both time - scales @xmath37 and @xmath35 , and we expect qualitatively different behavior depending on their relative magnitude . here",
    "we shall focus on the limiting cases @xmath38 and @xmath39 .    physically in the limit of very fast cooling ( @xmath38 ) , we expect the state immediately following the quench to have minimal overlap with that observed at time @xmath37 so that @xmath40 . assuming that the solutions of the dynamical equations are well - defined in the limit when the microscopic time - scale goes to zero",

    "@xmath42 may depend only on their ratio @xmath43 on dimensional grounds : @xmath44 . since @xmath45",
    "we expect @xmath46 , and this functional form of @xmath42 remains@xcite at larger values of @xmath47 . similarly in this fast - cooling regime",
    "we expect @xmath48 , so that in the limit of small @xmath49 there is a quasi - fdt relation ( @xmath50 ) , which remains valid@xcite over the full range @xmath51 .",
    "the other limiting case is that of slow cooling ( @xmath39 ) , where we expect that the correlation and response functions will have their only time - dependence through the specified cooling process @xmath52 where @xmath53 : @xmath54 $ ] and @xmath55 $ ] .",
    "if this conjecture is correct , it implies that the system has a non - decaying memory of its past history . of course this assumes again that the solutions to the dynamical equations are well - defined in the limit of vanishing microscopic time - scales . for the sherrington - kirkpatrick model,@xcite this `` adiabatic ansatz '' for linear @xmath56 leads@xcite to the solutions @xmath57 and @xmath58 , which result in a field - cooled susceptibility in qualitative agreement with a previous equilibrium result.@xcite",
    "however application of the same method to the @xmath4 ising model leads to a delta - function solution for the response function;@xcite this form is worrisome given the original adiabatic nature of the ansatz .",
    "however , in principle the response could be broadened to be long compared to the microscopic time - scale but short compared to the final measurement time.@xcite when we started our numerical study of this problem , our expectations were therefore that the only time scale in the slow cooling process is set by the cooling rate , @xmath59 , and that the response and the correlation functions depend only on the ratios @xmath60 and @xmath60 as indicated in the @xmath61 column of table 1 .",
    "this hypothesis turned out to be only partially correct .",
    "instead we have found that indeed just below @xmath9 the correlation and response functions depend only on the ratios @xmath60 and @xmath60 but @xmath62 is a _ new _ time - scale @xmath63 that emerges in this cooling regime ; however there is evidence that the exponent @xmath64 vanishes at low temperatures , indicating that `` adiabatic cooling '' is recovered .",
    "we note that a finite value of @xmath64 implies a decaying memory and hence ageing , and thus the disappearance of @xmath64 means that the system recovers its memory and thus `` rejuvenates '' at low temperatures .",
    "our expectations for the three cooling regimes are summarized in table i. in section ii .",
    "we derive the dynamical equations for the array in the low - field @xmath65 regime .",
    "the system goes out of equilibrium at a temperature @xmath9 ( determined by the cooling rate ) , and we study its low - temperature ( @xmath66 ) behavior numerically in all three cooling regimes ; our results are presented in section iii .",
    "we also probe the structure of phase space in this glassy regime ( section iiid ) where the periodic array is stuck in one of an extensive number of metastable states .",
    "@xcite what happens to these states when the temperature is decreased ?",
    "each state , formed at @xmath9 , may evolve smoothly ; alternatively it can further subdivide as in the case of the ( disordered ) sherrington - kirkpatrick model .",
    "we find that in this periodic array there is no further subdivision down to zero temperatures , and that the number of metastable states remains exponentially large .",

    "we see that @xmath270 is constant even in the slow cooling regime indicating `` perfect '' memory .",

    "appear as the temperature is lowered . in this case application of a heat pulse",
    "removes some of this subdivision and results in a partial loss of memory . for the periodic array",

    "if the metastable states did subdivide with decreasing temperature , the correlation and response functions obtained with and without the application of a moderate heat pulse would be different ; in the former case memory of some of the subdivisions would be erased .",

    "first we simulated finite - size arrays with @xmath280 at very low temperatures and confirmed that the number of metastable states grows exponentially with system - size .",
    "we also studied the distribution of overlaps between these states , and our results are displayed in figure 14 for @xmath280 . here",
    "we see that the overlap distribution evolves to a sharp peak with a maximum that shifts to lower @xmath281 with increasing number of wires @xmath8 .",
    "in particular we do not observe any states with large overlaps for @xmath282 ; furthermore @xmath283 suggests that for large values of @xmath8 the states are equidistant in phase space .",

    "the equidistance of metastable states does not imply that the structure of the phase space is simple .",
    "in particular the basins of attraction associated with different metastable states appear to be complicated .",

    "the results are displayed in figure 15 .",
    "we see that the probability to evolve to _ different _ states remains finite even if the starting overlap is close to unity .",
    "our results suggest that @xmath287 for @xmath30 .",

    "first we note that the energy required to flip @xmath71 spins can not be larger than @xmath288 .",
    "the probability of evolving to a different metastable state after the flipping of @xmath71 spins is roughly @xmath289 so the probability to find _ some _ @xmath71 spins which lead to this result is @xmath290 .",

    "we note that this result implies that the distribution of barriers and overlaps are _ not _ related .    .",
    "the data shown here are the results of a direct numerical simulations of a finite size arrays with @xmath280 ; the gray , dashed and black curves correspond to @xmath292 and @xmath293 respectively .",
    "what are the observable consequences of the different behavior in the response and the correlation functions for the three cooling regimes ?",

    "hence the response involves a four - spin term ( @xmath297 ) . here",
    "we discuss the magnetization induced by a small increment of magnetic field applied at time @xmath298 ; this is of course the simplest possible case .",
    "still the value of the observed moment will depend on the relative magnitudes of @xmath298 , @xmath35 , @xmath62 and @xmath37 as indicated in the schematic of figure 16 .",
    "we proceed to discuss each separate case below .     indicating the time - scales involved in a finite - cooling experiment as discussed in the text ; @xmath9 and @xmath299 refer to the temperature and time when the system goes out of equilibrium , and @xmath298 and @xmath62 are the time - scales associated with the onset of an additional field and ageing",

    "t_c ~0^t_h ( d^2) h dt = x d^2_0 ( ) ^2 ( t_h- t_g)h [ fmoment ] where we have used the `` fast cooling '' scaling form for the correlation function exhibited in table i. since the fast - cooling response function decays with time , ( [ fmoment ] ) indicates an `` ageing '' moment which decreases as a function of decreasing ratio @xmath301 ( @xmath302 ) .",
    "( [ fmoment ] ) also implies markedly different behavior if @xmath303 or @xmath304 ; this is the array analogue of the standard zero - field vs. field cooled susceptibility measurement often performed on spin glasses.@xcite      now the cooling is continued after the field application ( cf .",
    "figure 13 ) , and the dominant contribution to the expression for the moment , ( [ moment ] ) , will come from the range @xmath306 where @xmath62 is the `` ageing '' time - scale discussed in the slow cooling regime in section iii .",
    "here there are two possibilities :    _ ( a ) @xmath307 _    in this case the correlation and the response functions are non - decaying ( cf . figs . 4 - 7 ) and the moment is a constant as in ( [ mconst ] ) .",
    "_ ( b ) @xmath308 _    the correlation and response functions have no memory on time - scales greater than @xmath62 ; therefore the moment is zero .",
    "the system is displaying ageing analogous to that observed in spin glasses;@xcite as in the latter case , there appears to be a `` rejuvenation '' associated with improved memory at low temperatures where @xmath62 increases .",
    "we also remark that application of a a.c .",
    "field could lead to a direct experimental determination of @xmath309 ; there we expect @xmath310 as shown below in figure 17 . here",
    "we define @xmath311 .",
    "we note that the low - frequency part of the displayed curves is universal and so would provide an experimental determination of the time - scale associated with ageing , @xmath62 .    .",
    "here we show the results for the cooling rates @xmath312 ( upper curve ) and @xmath313 ( lower curve ) .",
    "the upper curve shows imaginary part of susceptibility measured at reduced temperature @xmath314 ; the lower curve corresponds to the measurement at @xmath315 .",
    "the frequency @xmath316 is measured in units of the inverse characteristic time , @xmath317 , corresponding to the decay of the correlation function . here",

    "the moment is simply a constant with no time - dependence but with possible dependence on the cooling rate if @xmath230 .",
    "in conclusion we have studied history - dependence and ageing in a periodic model in the _ absence _ of disorder . in the case of a fast quench ( @xmath179 ) a generalized fluctuation dissipation theorem relation ( @xmath323 ) exists between the correlation and the response functions , and furthermore the latter exhibit a predicted scaling form.@xcite in the other limit of slow cooling ( @xmath39 ) there is numerical evidence for the existence of an `` ageing '' time - scale @xmath62 such that for @xmath324 the system forgets its past , but for @xmath325 it has `` perfect memory '' .",
    "this additional time - scale increases to that associated with the cooling process with decreasing temperature , indicating that at low temperatures the system recovers its memory and an adiabatic solution ( cf .",
    "table i ) reappears .",
    "however the form of this solution does not ressemble ( cf .",
    "8) the `` adiabatic ansatz''@xcite @xmath326 and @xmath327 , which is probably _ never _ correct .",
    "we speculate that this is due to the presence of an extensive number of states exactly at the glass transition , where the time - scale associated with the cooling process is significantly less than that of the system s relaxation .",
    "by contrast , in the sherrington - kirkpatrick model such `` branching of states '' occurs at lower temperatures where the cooling and relaxation times are comparable ; in this case the assumption that there are no additional time - scales@xcite leads to results which agree with those obtained by thermodynamic methods.@xcite    we also speculate on two different scenarios for the decrease of the exponent @xmath64 ( @xmath328 ) with decreasing temperatures , and the reappearance of the adiabatic solution .",
    "one is that the latter solution is always present for @xmath329 , but its weight is proportional to a high power of @xmath330 , and thus is only observable at lower temperatures .",
    "another possibility is that @xmath331 corresponds to a second dynamical transition at lower temperatures .",
    "below the temperature associated with this second dynamical instability the metastable states would not evolve dramatically with subsequent cooling , leading to the absence of further ageing effects .",
    "naturally the emergence of @xmath62 from an analytic ansatz for the dynamical equations would provide additional insight to this issue .",
    "unfortunately these equations are difficult to solve in the slow - cooling regime since the corrections to long - time behavior are of the same order as the leading terms themselves .    just below its glass transition temperature",
    ", the periodic array becomes stuck in one of an extensive number of metastable states that are equidistant in phase space .",
    "our numerical studies indicate that there is _ no further subdivision _ of these states at lower temperatures , in contrast to the situation for the ( disordered ) sherrington - kirkpatrick model .",
    "however the probability to evolve to different metastable states remains finite even if the starting overlap is very close to unity , which suggests that the distribution of barriers and the overlaps are _ not _ simply related .",
    "it would be interesting to know if these features of the periodic array s low - temperature phase space are signatory of a glass with distinct dynamic and static transitions .",
    "naturally there remain several questions to be addressed in future projects .",
    "a key feature of this periodic array is that it can be realized experimentally;@xcite a calculation and subsequent experimental determination of its nonlinear response be quite interesting . in a real system",
    "there are everpresent induced screening currents ignored in the present treatment , and the addition of these terms could lead to novel memory effects . amusingly enough , ageing effects are not present in the disordered long - range array ; a study of the crossover between the periodic and the random networks might provide further insight into the origin of this widespread but mysterious phenomenon .    we would like to acknowledge useful discussions with j. kurchan , d. sherrington , m. stephens , and thank a. schweitzer for his help in optimizing the numerical code .",
