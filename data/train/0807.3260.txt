    "a natural problem in dynamical systems is to determine which measured dynamics admit topological or smooth realisations .",

    "in this paper , we tackle the following question : _ given a manifold @xmath0 , which measured dynamical systems can be realised as uniquely ergodic minimal homeomorphisms on @xmath0 ? _",
    "our main result asserts that this class of dynamical systems is stable under extension .",
    "[ theo.extension ] let @xmath0 be a compact topological manifold of dimension at least two .",
    "assume we are given    * a uniquely ergodic minimal homeomorphism @xmath1 on @xmath0 , with invariant measure  @xmath2 ; * an invertible ergodic dynamical system @xmath3 on a standard borel space , which is an extension of  @xmath4 .",
    "then there exists a uniquely ergodic minimal homeomorphism @xmath5 on @xmath0 , with invariant measure @xmath6 , such that the measured dynamical system @xmath7 is isomorphic to @xmath3 .",
    "let us recall the classical definitions .",
    "a _ measured dynamical system _ is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a probability space and @xmath10 is a bi - measurable bijective map for which @xmath11 is an invariant measure .",
    "given two such systems @xmath8 and @xmath3 , the second is an _ extension _ of the first through a measurable map @xmath12 if @xmath13 are full measure subsets of @xmath14 , the map @xmath15 sends the measure @xmath16 to the measure @xmath11 , and the conjugacy relation @xmath17 holds on @xmath18 .",
    "if , in addition , the map @xmath15 is bijective and bi - measurable , then the systems are _ isomorphic_. a measurable space @xmath19 is called a _ standard borel space _ if @xmath20 is the borel @xmath21-algebra of some topology on @xmath22 for which @xmath22 is a polish space ( _ i.e. _ a metrizable complete separable space ) . throughout the text",
    "all the topological spaces will be implicitly equipped with their borel @xmath21-algebra , in particular all the measures on topological spaces are borel measures . note that if some measured dynamical system @xmath3 satisfies the conclusion of theorem  [ theo.extension ] , then it is obviously isomorphic to a dynamical system on a standard borel space , thus it is reasonable to restrict ourselves to such systems .",
    "we say that a homeomorphism @xmath1 on a topological space @xmath0 , with an invariant measure @xmath2 , is a _ realisation _ of a measured dynamical system @xmath8 if the measured dynamical system @xmath4 is isomorphic to @xmath8 .",
    "independently of theorem  [ theo.extension ] we will prove the following result .",
    "[ theo.circle-rotation ] any irrational rotation of the circle admits a uniquely ergodic minimal realisation on the two - torus .",
    "the proof of this result relies on a rather classical construction .",
    "the realisation is a skew - product @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a continuous map .",
    "it will be obtained as the limit of homeomorphisms conjugated to the  trivial \" homeomorphism    theorems  [ theo.extension ] and  [ theo.circle-rotation ] can be associated to provide a partial answer to the realisation problem on the two - torus .",
    "remember that a measured dynamical system @xmath8 is an extension of some irrational circle rotation if and only if the spectrum of the associated operator on @xmath25 has an irrational eigenvalue .",
    "therefore , as an immediate consequence of theorem  [ theo.extension ] and  [ theo.circle-rotation ] , we get the following corollary .",
    "if an ergodic measured dynamical system on a standard borel space has an irrational eigenvalue in its spectrum , then it admits a uniquely ergodic minimal realisation on the two - torus .",
    "this result is known not to be optimal : indeed there exist uniquely ergodic minimal homeomorphisms of the two - torus that are weakly mixing ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "actually , it might turn out that _ every _ aperiodic ergodic system admits a uniquely ergodic minimal realisation on the two - torus ; at least no obstruction is known to the authors .",
    "for instance , we are not able to answer the following test questions :    * does an adding machine admit a uniquely ergodic minimal realisation on the two - torus ? * what about a bernoulli shift ?",
    "our original motivation for studying realisation problems was to generalise denjoy counter - examples in higher dimensions , that is , to construct ( interesting ) examples of homeomorphisms of the @xmath26-torus that are topologically semi - conjugate to an irrational rotation .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ theo.extension ] actually provides a topological semi - conjugacy between the maps @xmath5 and @xmath1 ( see theorem  [ theo.extension-bis ] below ) .",
    "thus another corollary of our results is : _ any ergodic system which is an extension of an irrational rotation @xmath27 of the two - torus can be realised as a uniquely ergodic minimal homeomorphism which is topologically semi - conjugate to @xmath27 . _ for more comments on realisation problems and generalisations of denjoy counter - examples , we refer to the introduction of our previous work  @xcite .",
    "the reader interested in the smooth version can consult  @xcite , and especially the last section .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ theo.extension ] relies heavily on our previous work .",
    "given the main result in  @xcite , theorem  [ theo.extension ] essentially reduces to a realisation problem on cantor sets : roughly speaking , we have to turn a measured extension into a topological skew - product . concerning this issue",
    ", remember that the classical realisation problem on cantor sets has been solved by hansel - raoult and krieger .",
    "improving the work of jewett , they have proved the so - called jewett - krieger theorem : _ any ergodic system admits a uniquely ergodic minimal realisation on a cantor set _ ( @xcite ) .",
    "a relative version of this result has later been provided by weiss ( @xcite ) , allowing the realisation of a measured extension as a topological semi - conjugacy . in the present text",

    ", we choose a small neighbourhood @xmath1062 of @xmath1063 and a continuous map @xmath1064 , @xmath140-close to the identity of @xmath1022 , equal to @xmath1065 on @xmath1066 , and that coincides with the identity on the boundary of @xmath1062",
    ". then we set for @xmath1067 , @xmath1068 if the neighbourhoods @xmath1062 are chosen small enough then the sets @xmath1069 for @xmath1070 are pairwise disjoint and the above formulae do make sense . for the points @xmath105 that do not belong to one of these sets , @xmath1071 is defined to be the identity map of @xmath1022 . * we choose an open interval @xmath1072 of length @xmath140 which depends continuously on @xmath1073 and such that for every @xmath1074 it contains @xmath1027 whenever @xmath105 belongs to @xmath1057 for some @xmath1075 .",
    "then we consider the horizontal strip @xmath1076 .        1 .",
    "the first item of the lemma is a consequence of the definition of @xmath33 .",
    "2 .   since the map @xmath1077 is @xmath140-close to the identity map of the circle @xmath1025 , the homeomorphism @xmath1078 is @xmath140-close to @xmath998 .",
    "3 .   let @xmath406 be a @xmath33-invariant continuous graph .",
    "then @xmath1079 is a @xmath1080-invariant continuous graph .",
    "hence there exists a point @xmath1081 such that @xmath1082 .",
    "let @xmath1032 be an integer such that @xmath1083 .",
    "we claim that @xmath406 is @xmath1084-dense in @xmath1085 .",
    "indeed consider a point @xmath105 in @xmath1063 .",
    "on the one hand , for every @xmath1086 , the point @xmath1087 belongs to the graph @xmath406 .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath1088 , by our choice of @xmath105 we have @xmath1089 and this point belongs to @xmath1090 by our choice of @xmath1065 and since @xmath1091 .",
    "now remember that the length of the interval @xmath1027 is less than @xmath1028 and that the integer @xmath222 was chosen in such a way that the sequence @xmath1092 is @xmath1028-dense in @xmath1020 .",
    "this shows the claim .",
    "+ since the intervals @xmath1033 are pairwise disjoint , there is at most one integer @xmath1093 such that @xmath1094 . by construction",
    "the union @xmath1095 is @xmath1028-dense in @xmath1025 .",
    "therefore the graph @xmath406 is @xmath1007-dense in @xmath1096 .",
    "4 .   let us once again consider a @xmath33-invariant continuous graph @xmath1097 . as",
    "above for every @xmath1088 and @xmath1098 such that @xmath1083 , the point @xmath1099 belongs to the set @xmath1090 which is included in the strip @xmath1100",
    ". there is at most one @xmath1013 such that @xmath1101 .",
    "hence , @xmath1102 as a consequence , we get @xmath1103 ( the second inequality follows from the definition of the intervals @xmath1104 and the integer @xmath222 ) .",
    "we set @xmath1109 . assuming that the sequence @xmath1110 has been constructed",
    ", we consider a small positive number @xmath1111 ( the conditions on @xmath1111 will be detailed below ) and we apply the lemma to @xmath1112 . the lemma provides the maps @xmath1113 and @xmath1114 , and we have @xmath1115 by the second item of the lemma the homeomorphisms @xmath1113 and @xmath999 are @xmath1111-close , so if @xmath1111 has been chosen small enough , then @xmath1116 is @xmath1117-close to @xmath1118 .",
    "one can thus assume that the sequence @xmath1119 is a cauchy sequence .",
    "it converges to a homeomorphism @xmath28 of the two - torus , which will be a skew - product of the form required by the theorem ( because of the first item of the lemma and since @xmath1120 is closed in the space of circle homeomorphisms ) .",
    "it remains to check that , as soon as the sequence @xmath1121 decreases sufficiently fast , the map @xmath28 satisfies the conclusions of the theorem .",
    "let us address the minimality . by item 3 of the lemma , at step @xmath218",
    "every @xmath1122-invariant continuous graph is @xmath376-dense in @xmath1001 .",
    "consequently we can choose @xmath376 small enough so that every @xmath1123-invariant graph is @xmath1124-dense in @xmath1001 .",
    "since @xmath1123 is conjugate to @xmath999 , every orbit is dense in an invariant circle , and there exists a positive integer @xmath1125 such that every piece of orbit @xmath1126 is again @xmath1124-dense in @xmath1001 .",
    "this last property is open : the sequence @xmath1127 can be chosen so that this property is shared by the limit map @xmath28 , namely , every piece of @xmath28-orbit of length @xmath1125 is @xmath1124-dense .",
    "this entails the minimality of @xmath28 .",
    "we now turn to the ergodic properties .",
    "let @xmath1100 be the horizontal strip given by item 4 of the lemma when applied at step @xmath218 and let @xmath1128 .",
    "then @xmath1129 is a horizontal strip : the intersection of @xmath1129 with any circle @xmath1130 is an interval , whose length is less than @xmath1124 if @xmath376 is small enough .",
    "furthermore , for every @xmath1123-invariant continuous graph @xmath406 , the set @xmath1131 is an open subset of the circle whose lebesgue measure is bigger than @xmath1132 .",
    "then the unique ergodicity of the rotation @xmath991 entails the following fact .",
    "there exists a positive integer @xmath1125 with the following property : every @xmath1123-orbit of length @xmath1125 spends more than a ratio @xmath1133 of its time within the strip @xmath1129 , in other words for every point @xmath31 , @xmath1134    since @xmath1135 is open , every point @xmath31 has a neighbourhood @xmath1136 such that this inequality remains true when we replace @xmath31 by any point @xmath1137 and @xmath1123 by any map which is @xmath1138-close to @xmath1123 ( for some positive @xmath1138 ) .",
    "thus , by compactness , the property expressed in the fact is open , and shared by the map @xmath28 as soon as the sequence @xmath1127 tends to @xmath351 fast enough . as a consequence , for any @xmath28-invariant measure @xmath11 one has @xmath1139    for any positive integer @xmath358 we set @xmath1140 for any @xmath28-invariant measure @xmath11 , the measure of @xmath1141 is bounded from below by @xmath1142 and is positive if the sequence @xmath1121 goes to @xmath351 fast enough ; hence @xmath125 has measure @xmath324 .",
    "remember also that @xmath1129 is a strip of thickness less than @xmath1124 .",
    "thus the intersection of @xmath125 with any vertical circle is empty or reduced to a point : @xmath125 is a measurable graph over a set of full lebesgue measure .",
    "the unique ergodicity of the rotation @xmath991 implies that @xmath28 is also uniquely ergodic , the only invariant measure being the measure @xmath11 defined by the formula @xmath1143 this completes the proof of theorem  [ t.exotic-rotation ] .",
