    "extended ly@xmath2 regions are a common feature of high redshift radio galaxies ( @xmath32 , hzrg ) and quasars ( heckman et al .",
    "1991 ; see also narrow band ly@xmath2 images of hzrg in , e.g , kurk et al .",
    "2001 ; chambers , miley & van breugel 1990 ; mccarthy et al .",
    "most morphological and kinematic studies are based on the high surface brightness regions .",
    "these regions are clumpy , irregular and often aligned with the radio axis .",
    "they are characterized by extreme kinematics , with measured fwhm and velocity shifts @xmath41000 km s@xmath5 ( baum & mccarthy 2000 , villar - martn , binette & fosbury 1999 , mccarthy , baum & spinrad 1996 ) , compared to values of @xmath1few hundreds in low redshift radio galaxies ( baum , heckman & van breugel 1990 , tadhunter , fosbury & quinn 1989 ) .",
    "although gravitational motions can not be rejected , it is likely that a perturbing mechanism is responsible for the extreme kinematics .",
    "the apparent connection between the radio and the kinematic properties suggests that such a mechanism could be shocks generated by the interaction between the radio outflow and the gas in situ ( van ojik et al .",
    "1997 ) . galactic winds ( heckman , armus & miley 1990 ) are an alternative possibility .",
    "in addition to these regions , low surface brightness ly@xmath2 halos extending beyond the radio structures have been detected in some hzrg .",
    "the kinematic properties of such halos have been studied in detail only in one case , the radio galaxy mrc1243 + 036 ( van ojik et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the halo shows quiescent kinematics [ fwhm(ly@xmath2)@xmath1 250 km s@xmath5 ] compared to the regions inside the radio structures [ fwhm(ly@xmath2)@xmath11200 km s@xmath5 ] .",
    "the authors propose that the halo is a large rotating gaseous disc originating from the accretion associated with the formation of the galaxy .",
    "such quiescent low surface brightness halos ( lsbhs , hereafter ) are important since they show the gas properties unaffected by kinematic perturbations .",
    "we are undertaking a research program using high s / n keck spectroscopy of a sample of high redshift radio galaxies ( @xmath72.5 ) whose goal is to search for kinematically unperturbed ly@xmath2 halos in hzrg .",
    "we will study the kinematic and ionization properties , as well as observed properties such as surface brightness , size and luminosity .",
    "constraints will also be set on the halo mass and its possible origin .",
    "the results on the radio galaxy uss0828 + 193 are presented in this paper . in a forthcoming paper",
    "we will discuss the results on the rest of the sample .",
    "uss0828 + 193 ( rttgering , miley & chambers 1995 ) ( @xmath02.57 ) is a large radio source ( @xmath170 kpc)=72 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 and @xmath8=0.5 . in this cosmology , 1",
    "arcsec corresponds to @xmath15 kpc ] showing a double morphology and a jet extending from the core to the northern hot spot .",
    "the optical hst image shows an irregular morphology consisting of several clumps aligned with the radio axis ( pentericci et al .",
    "1999 , see also fig .  1 top panel in this paper ) .",
    "the high polarization level ( @xmath1 10 per cent ) implies that the uv rest frame continuum is dominated by continuum from the active nucleus ( agn ) scattered by ( most probably ) dust in the extended gas ( vernet et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the spectra were obtained with the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris , oke et al .",
    "1995 ) with its polarimeter ( goodrich , cohen , putney 1995 ) at the keck ii 10 m telescope in december 1997 .",
    "we used a 300 line mm@xmath5 grating and 1 arcsec wide slit which provide a dispersion of 2.4    pixel@xmath5 and an effective resolution of fwhm@xmath110.5    ( instrumental profile ) .",
    "the exposure time was 5 hours .",
    "the seeing ( @xmath11.0 arcsec ) was measured with the m5v type star located inside the slit .",
    "the slit was oriented along the radio axis , with pa 44@xmath9 ( carilli et al .",
    "1997 ) . for a more detailed description of the observations and data reduction see vernet et al . 2001 .",
    "each individual frame was calibrated in wavelength and corrected for slit curvature using arc spectra .",
    "this initial wavelength calibration was refined using strong sky lines . in order to compensate for residual distortions ( shifts ) due to flexures in lris , we extracted from every frame a section around lya+nv 1240 and one around civ 1550+heii 1640 ( civ and heii respectively , hereafter ) .",
    "the individual sub - frames corresponding to the same spectral range were spatially aligned ( using the continuum centroid ) and combined . the two final frames ( one for ly@xmath2+nv and another one for civ+heii ) were also spatially aligned , assuming that the continuum centroid has the same spatial position at all wavelengths .",
    "this is reasonable in this small spectral range , taking also into account that the spatial resolution element has a large physical size ( @xmath1 5 kpc ) .",
    "the spectra ( ly@xmath2+nv and heii+civ frames ) were divided in several apertures along the spatial direction and a spectrum was extracted for each one .",
    "the apertures were selected so that the gas has apparently similar kinematic properties across the spatial extension of a given aperture .",
    "the apertures were also selected to obtain enough s / n ratio in ly@xmath2 , civ and heii ( if possible ) to fit the line profiles ( see figs .  3 and 4 ) .",
    "separate apertures were defined for the gas beyond the radio structures .",
    "figure 1 ( top panel ) shows the overlay between the optical wfpc2 hst image and vla contours ( see pentericci et al .",
    "1999 for a description ) .",
    "the 2-dimensional ly@xmath2 keck spectrum is shown on the bottom panel spatially aligned with the image .",
    "we identified the radio core with the brightest component in the nicmos hst image .",
    "our main conclusions would not be affected if we chose to identify the radio core with the vertex of the ionization cone described by pentericci et al .",
    "( 1999 ) or the brightest optical component .",
    "an interesting feature is already obvious in this figure : a low surface brightness ly@xmath2 halo extending for @xmath1 16 arcsec or 80 kpc inside and beyond the radio structures .",
    "it extends to much larger distances than the material observed on the hst images ( @xmath14 arcsec ) .",
    "the hst image shows , therefore , only a small fraction of the total distribution of material .",
    "the kinematics of this halo is more quiescent than the kinematics of the brightest regions .",
    "we show in fig .  2 the 2-dimensional spectrum ( contours ) of the main emission lines .",
    "seven apertures were selected in the spatial direction for the kinematic analysis , which are indicated in fig .",
    "the corresponding 1-dimensional spectra in the ly@xmath2 and the civ+heii regions are shown in fig .",
    "apertures @xmath10 correspond to the low surface brightness ly@xmath2 halo .",
    "although very noisy , civ and heii are detected in apertures @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( see fig .",
    "the ly@xmath2 and heii spectral profiles were analysed and fitted in each aperture with one , two or three gaussians , depending on the quality of the fit .",
    "civ , in spite of being a strong line , turned out to be very difficult to constrain due to the presence of the doublet components ( for a discussion on the uncertainties on interpreting the kinematics of the extended gas in hzrg using rest frame uv emission lines see villar - martn et al .",
    "therefore the results of the multiple component fit are only shown for lya and heii .",
    "those presented for civ correspond to a single gaussian fit . for each kinematic component ,",
    "the fwhm ( corrected for instrumental broadening in quadrature ) and the velocity shift relative to the emission at the continuum centroid were calculated ( the heii line at the continuum centroid was used to estimate the zero velocity ) .",
    "some of the fits are shown in fig .",
    "three kinematic components are found in lya : ( i ) a narrow component with fwhm@xmath13400 km s@xmath5 detected in all apertures ; ( ii ) a broad component with fwhm@xmath11200 km s@xmath5 detected in all apertures except @xmath12 and @xmath14 ( note this is also detected beyond the radio lobe in aperture @xmath15 ) ; ( iii ) a very broad component with fwhm@xmath12500 km s@xmath5 only found in apertures @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( brightest regions ) .",
    "the best fit to the heii profile reveals two components in apertures @xmath16 and @xmath17 similar ( in fwhm ) to components ( i ) and ( ii ) in ly@xmath2 .",
    "narrow heii ( aperture @xmath11 ) and civ ( apertures @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) are also detected .    _",
    "( i ) the narrow component ( @xmath13400 km s@xmath5 ) : _ the spatial variation of the kinematic properties of this component are shown on panels @xmath18 ( fwhm ) and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) in fig .  6 .",
    "different symbols are used for ly@xmath2 ( circles ) , heii ( stars ) and civ ( triangles ) . this component extends across the whole object ( @xmath180 kpc ) and beyond the radio structures .",
    "the kinematic properties are very uniform across the whole spatial extension .",
    "there are no obvious changes associated with the radio structures .",
    "ly@xmath2 is very sensitive to absorption by neutral hydrogen and the interpretation of the spectral profile in terms of pure kinematics is risky .",
    "in fact , van ojik et al . (",
    "1997 ) found that the entire blue wing of the ly@xmath2 ( spatially integrated ) profile of this galaxy is absorbed by neutral gas associated with the galaxy .",
    "however , the fact that a similar narrow component has been found in heii ( which is not a resonance line ) strongly supports the existence of a narrow component in ly@xmath2 in addition to the broad components .",
    "this is also supported by the very narrow profile of civ and heii in apertures @xmath11 and @xmath12 and the very narrow peak observed on top of the civ and heii lines in the inner apertures , @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( see fig .",
    "_ ( ii ) the broad component ( @xmath11200 km s@xmath5 ) _",
    "( open circles for ly@xmath2 , open triangles for civ and stars for heii in panels @xmath21 and @xmath22 in fig .  6 ) .",
    "this component is also spatially extended ( @xmath111 arcsec ) and with quite uniform fwhm across the object , with no apparent link with the radio structures .",
    "this kinematically perturbed gas is also found in the ly@xmath2 halo .",
    "the measured fwhm is consistent within the errors for the three emission lines ( heii , civ , ly@xmath2 ) where it is detected , with marginal evidence for narrower ly@xmath2 .",
    "this could be due to absorption by neutral hydrogen .",
    "this component extends beyond the radio structures ( aperture @xmath15 ) .",
    "seeing effects might be responsible for spreading the detection of this component beyond the radio lobes .",
    "astrometry errors are not likely to be responsible ( see below ) .    _",
    "( iii ) the very broad component ( @xmath12500 km s@xmath5 ) _ ( solid circles in panels @xmath21 and @xmath22 in fig .",
    "6 ) is spatially extended and it is only detected in ly@xmath2 in apertures @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "this component ( which extends across the entire object and beyond the edge of the radio lobes ) shows no apparent association with the radio structures .",
    "the kinematic properties are similar to those of low redshift radio galaxies ( fwhm and velocity shift of a few hundred km s@xmath5 , e.g. tadhunter , fosbury & quinn 1989 ) .",
    "this suggests that there is no ( or little ) interaction and this gas is unperturbed by the jet / radio lobes .",
    "absorption of ly@xmath2 photons could explain the difference in the velocity shift of ly@xmath2 and heii in the inner apertures .",
    "the kinematics of this narrow component is consistent with gravitational motions .",
    "this gaseous component also emits civ and heii lines .",
    "it is the first time that lines other than ly@xmath2 are detected from the low surface brightness halo of a hzrg .",
    "this implies that the gas is ionized .",
    "it is not a mirror of neutral hydrogen that reflects ly@xmath2 by resonant scattering ( villar - martn , binette & fosbury 1996 ) .",
    "there is marginal evidence for continuum detection in the halo ( see fig .  4 ) .",
    "the nature of this continuum is very uncertain",
    ". it could be due to scattered light , although stars can not be rejected .",
    "the large equivalent widths of civ and heii suggest that the gas is not ionized by stars , but rather by a mechanism related to the active nucleus .",
    "this is also implied by the civ / heii@xmath11 value measured for the narrow component ( at least in aperture @xmath12 and maybe also aperture @xmath11 , see fig  4 ) , similar to the ratio measured in aperture @xmath16 and consistent with measurements in other hzrg ( e.g. villar - martn , tadhunter & clark 1997 ) .",
    "this suggests the same ionization mechanism in the low surface brightness halo and the bright regions , in spite of the different kinematic properties .",
    "since the halo extends beyond the radio structures where shocks are unlikely to be present , the ionization mechanism is probably ionization by the central agn ( ionization by the continuum generated by hot shocked gas is an alternative mechanism ) .",
    "on the other hand , the detection of civ emission shows that the halo has been enriched with heavy elements at very large distances from the nuclear region .",
    "it is not possible to constrain the metallicity using only the civ / heii ratio , but solar abundances are certainly possible ( villar - martn , tadhunter & clark 1997 , vernet et al .",
    "2001 ) . a galactic wind ,",
    "whose presence is suggested by the broad component detected at similar distance from the nucleus , might be the mechanism responsible for the enrichment of the gas .      the broad component ( @xmath11200 km s@xmath5 )",
    "is apparently detected beyond the eastern radio lobe .",
    "errors in the astrometry are unlikely to be responsible : if the active nucleus were located at the vertex of the ionization cone described by pentericci et al .",
    "( 1999 ) or at the brightest optical feature , the broad component would extend even further beyond the edge of the radio lobe .",
    "however , we do not discard the possibility that seeing effects might be smearing the emission enough that the broad component actually does not extend beyond the radio lobes .",
    "if the detection beyond the radio structures is real , this implies that the motions of this gas are not a consequence of jet - cloud interactions .",
    "evidence for perturbed gas beyond radio structures has been found in other objects ( e.g. villar - martn , binette and fosbury 1999 , solrzano - iarrea , tadhunter & axon 2001 ) .",
    "galactic winds could be an alternative possibility .",
    "clouds exposed to ram pressure of the wind can be accelerated to several hundred km s@xmath5 and shifted by @xmath11000 km s@xmath5 ( heckman , armus & miley 1990 ) .",
    "the integration along the line of sight through several such clouds could explain the broad fwhm of this component .",
    "gas free - falling into the galaxy during the formation process from a large distance can also explain fwhm of this order ( lehnert & becker 1998 ) .",
    "the nature of the very broad component ( @xmath12500 km s@xmath5 ) in apertures @xmath16 and @xmath17 is not clear .",
    "it might be scattered light from a hidden broad line region ( vernet et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "( hereafter , we will refer to the gas emitting the narrow component as the low surface brightness halo , lsbh ) .",
    "the integrated ly@xmath2 flux @xmath23 of the lsbh along the slit is 1.64@xmath2410@xmath25 erg s@xmath5 @xmath26 , which corresponds to a luminosity @xmath27=3.8@xmath2410@xmath28 erg s@xmath5 . for pure case b recombination and @xmath2910@xmath30 k ,",

    "the ionized halo has a biconical geometry .",
    "we have assumed that the cone axis is on the plane of the sky with an opening angle for the individual cones of @xmath190@xmath9 ( barthel 1989 ) .",

    "the authors found that the ly@xmath2 profile in eleven ( including uss0828 + 193 ) out of eighteen distant radio galaxies shows deep troughs which they interpret as hi absorption by absorbers that are likely to be physically associated with the galaxy hosting the radio source or its direct environment.2.92 ) , which shows large scale absorption troughs ( rttgering et al .",

    "the gas outside the ionization cones is neutral and we see it in absorption and the gas inside the cones is ionized and we see it in emission .",

    "respectively were considered .",
    "these are the projected distance values at which the broad component is detected at both sides of the continuum centroid ( see fig .",

    "the rest is neutral ( or with very low ionization level ) and we see it as absorption features imprinted on the ly@xmath2 profile      we have considered several scenarios :    * a rotating disc ( evidence for large discs associated with low redshift radio galaxies is discussed in  4.5.1 ) .",
    "signs for rotation of the extended gas in nearby radio galaxies have been found by several authors ( heckman et al .",

    "in this case , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the radius of the disc ( 40 kpc ) , @xmath34 is half the amplitude of the rotation curve and @xmath61 is the inclination angle of the disc with respect to the plane of the sky .",
    "this formula is applicable when we measure the rotation along the line of nodes .",

    "van ojik et al . ( 1996 ) propose that the giant ly@xmath2 halo associated with the radio galaxy mrc 1243 + 046 ( @xmath03.6 ) has settled as a rotating disc whose orientation ( the plane of the disc ) is within @xmath120@xmath9 of the orientation of the radio axis .",

    "if this is the case for the lsbh in uss0828 + 193 , the rotation axis would be approximately along the slit , since this was aligned with the radio axis .",
    "+ the ly@xmath2 velocity curve of the narrow component in uss0828 + 193 does not resemble a standard keplerian rotation curve for a slit located along the line of nodes .",
    "however , it is interesting to note that the observed pattern is similar to what we expect from a rotating disc if the slit was not aligned with the line of nodes , but rather close to the perpendicular direction and with some impact parameter with respect to the rotation center ( i.e. there is a distance between the center of the slit and the center of rotation ) .",
    "such a pattern is expected if the disc has a certain inclination relative to the plane of the sky . a close analysis of the civ line profile in the two inner apertures ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ,",

    "4 ) reveals the presence of a very narrow peak ( on top of a dominant broader component ) .",
    "the velocity shift of this narrow peak has been plotted in fig .",

    "the properties of the low surface brightness halo in uss0828 + 193 are , therefore , consistent with the expected properties for the extended gaseous halo , a required ingredient for galaxy formation models .",
    "however , the existence of the halo does not necessarily imply that uss0828 + 193 is a galaxy in the process of formation .",
    "similar halos have been found in lower redshift radio galaxies , where the galaxy is expected to be fully formed .",

    ", the consistency of the lsbh properties in uss0828 + 193 with expectations for the initial gas reservoir , suggests that the halo gas is part of the material from which the galaxy started to grow .",
    "we discuss here several structures found around other types of galaxies at different redshifts which might have the same origin as the low surface brightness halos found around distant radio galaxies .    * galactic envelopes : observations of absorption line systems in the spectra of background quasars have provided evidence for large ( @xmath123100 @xmath124 kpc ) extended gaseous envelopes that surround galaxies of a wide range of luminosity and morphological type ( e.g. chen , lanzetta & webb 2001 ; lanzetta et al .",

    "the authors propose that these structures are the results of mergers .",
    "the lsbh found around uss 0828 + 193 and other distant radio galaxies , might be the progenitors of the discs found at low redshift .",
    "therefore , giant gaseous halos ( @xmath4 several tens of kpc ) are found to be often associated with galaxies in general : active and non active , of different morphological types and luminosities and at different epochs .",
    "the origin and nature of such halos is not clear and different explanations have been proposed for different objects , but the definitive answer is uncertain .",
    "an interesting possibility is that these halos have a similar origin related to the formation process of the galaxies .",
    "by means of the spectral decomposition of the emission line profiles in uss0828 + 193 , we have isolated the emission from a giant ( @xmath180 kpc ) reservoir of apparently kinematically unperturbed gas , whose kinematics is consistent with being gravitational in nature .",
    "emission lines other than ly@xmath2 ( civ , heii ) have been detected for the first time in such a halo .",
    "this implies that the gas is ionized ( probably by the continuum from the agn ) and enriched with heavy elements .",
    "we find marginal evidence for continuum detection from the halo .",
    "we propose that the low surface brightness halo in uss0828 + 193 ( and other hzrg ) could be part of a gaseous reservoir that surrounds the entire object .",
    "we have considered several possible scenarios to explain the origin of the halo .",
    "the gas could have settled in a rotating disc .",
    "this is suggested by the velocity pattern of the halo emission , although 3-dimensional spectroscopy would be necessary to set tighter constrains on the kinematic patterns .",
    "evidence for giant gaseous discs has been found by other authors in low redshift radio galaxies and elliptical galaxies .    the halo could also be a group of individual clouds ( galactic satellites ? ) in a virialized system . in this case , the expected mass is @xmath18@xmath2410@xmath68 m@xmath57 .",
    "a similar value is estimated if the halo is infalling towards the center of the potential well .",
    "such values are similar to estimates of masses of low redshift radio galaxies , and smaller than typical masses of cd elliptical galaxies at low redshift .",
    "if this result is confirmed , we conclude that uss0828 + 193 will not become like the cd galaxies we see at the present epoch , unless mergers are involved .",
    "alternative scenarios that we have discussed ( also consistent with the observations ) are a cooling flow from a hot phase and outflows ( galactic winds ) . in this last case ,",
    "star forming rates @xmath1500 m@xmath57 yr@xmath5 are required , consistent with estimates for lyman break galaxies .",
    "the properties of the low surface brightness ly@xmath2 halo detected in the radio galaxy uss0828 + 193 are consistent with the expectations for the original gaseous reservoir from which the galaxy started to form .",
    "this does not necessarily imply that the galaxy is in the process of formation .",
    "we have also discussed the possible link of the low surface brightness halos with a ) the very extended envelopes found around galaxies of different morphological types and luminosities based on studies of absorption line systems in the spectra of background quasars b ) the giant ly@xmath2 halos associated with some ly break galaxies c ) the very extended reservoirs ( claimed to be discs ) of neutral gas associated with some nearby radio galaxies and elliptical galaxies .",
