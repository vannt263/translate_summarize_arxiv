    "the lattice boltzmann method ( lbm ) is a useful tool for simulations of the complex hydrodynamic phenomena such as turbulent flows , multiphase flows and suspensions .",
    "it is even believed that the subsequent development of the lattice boltzmann method may provide a new paradigm in the kinetic modeling due to its mathematical simplicity and computational efficiency @xcite .",
    "one important issue , which attracted considerable attention recently , is the enhancement of stability of the method @xcite .",
    "we remind that the early predecessor of the lbm , the lattice gas method of frisch , hasslacher and pomeau @xcite , was consistent with the @xmath0 theorem by the microscopic detailed balance and was supported by nonpolynomial equilibria ( maximizers of the fermi - dirac entropy ) .",
    "the method was was unconditionally stable , but in the course of the subsequent development of the lbm this feature of the unconditional stability , which otherwise would distinguish the lattice boltzmann method among other methods of computational fluid dynamics , was gradually lost .",
    "the reason why this happened can be traced back to the earliest versions of the lbm , derived from the lattice gas model , where the true nonpolynomial equilibria were replaced by their low - order polynomial approximations . of course , this was motivated by a search for computationally more effective schemes , beginning with the work of higuera , succi and benzi @xcite , and which eventually culminated in the athermal single relaxation time lattice bhatnagar - gross - krook model ( lbgk ) @xcite based on polynomial equilibria .",
    "later studies aimed at restoring the @xmath0-theorem for the lbm are well documented ( see , e.  g.  @xcite ) . at present ,",
    "the entropic lbgk models which combine computational efficiency of the standard lbgk with the unconditional stability pertinent to genuine kinetic models are constructed @xcite .",
    "first results of simulation of high reynolds number flows confirm the theoretically expected significant overall gain in performance of the lbm by using the entropic formulations @xcite .",
    "the present study is motivated in part by a recent publication @xcite entitled `` nonexistence of @xmath0 theorems for the athermal lattice boltzmann models with polynomial equilibria '' .",
    "therein , the authors demonstrated that polynomial equilibria used in the lattice boltzmann method on the two - dimensional triangular lattice ( the d2q7 model , see section [ new ] ) do not minimize any convex function , at least when parameters of these local equilibria are in a certain range .",
    "since the fact that polynomial equilibria are at odds with the maximum entropy principle ( and thus they are not local equilibria in a thermodynamic sense ) was pointed out already for some time ( see , for instance , @xcite ) , and actually the experience gained from many studies of various discrete velocity models @xcite does not indicate that polynomials are expected as local equilibria , it is therefore not surprising that the computation @xcite failed to derive a suitable entropy function for the d2q7 model .    in this paper , we revisit the problem of finding the @xmath0 function for the d2q7 model .",
    "our approach to derivation of the @xmath0 function follows the method suggested earlier in @xcite . the straightforward computation presented in detail results in the unique boltzmann - like entropy function for the d2q7 setup , thereby enabling construction of the entropic lattice boltzmann models for this lattice .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section [ elbm ] , for the sake of completeness , we review briefly the athermal lbgk and the athermal entropic lbm , in particular , the entropic lbgk .",
    "this section contains no new results . in section [ new ]",
    ", we consider the 2dq7 lattice , and find the appropriate @xmath0 function . in section [ secequilibrium ]",
    ", we find an approximate solution to the equilibrium distribution and discuss its accuracy .",
    "finally , in section [ discussion ] we put the entropic lattice boltzmann method into a perspective with other recent approaches to stabilization of the athermal lattice boltzmann models .",
    "in this section , for the sake of completeness , we briefly compare the entropic lattice boltzmann method ( elbm ) and the standard lattice boltzmann method ( lbm ) of athermal hydrodynamics .    in both the lbm and elbm methods ,",
    "one considers populations @xmath1 of discrete velocities @xmath2 , where @xmath3 , at discrete time @xmath4 .",
    "the discrete velocities form the links of a regular and sufficiently isotropic lattice , and it may also include a zero vector . it is convenient to introduce @xmath5-dimensional population vectors @xmath6 . in the isothermal case ,",
    "local hydrodynamic variables ( density @xmath7 and momentum density @xmath8 ) are defined at lattice sites @xmath9 as : @xmath10 the elbm begins with finding a convex function of populations , @xmath0 , which satisfies the following condition : if @xmath11 minimizes @xmath0 subject to the hydrodynamic constraints ( [ hyd ] ) , then @xmath12 also verifies the galilean invariance of the stress tensor : @xmath13 here @xmath14 is sound speed .",
    "the @xmath0 function which satisfies this condition to the accuracy of @xmath15 , and thus is valid to all purposes of incompressible simulations was derived in @xcite for the the d1q3 and the d2q9 lattices .",
    "later , this result was extended to the three - dimensional d3q27 lattice in @xcite .",
    "recently , other @xmath0 functions which verify equation ( [ gi ] ) to the accuracy of @xmath15 were found for isotropic bravais lattices in @xcite , in particular for the d2q6 model . in order to illustrate this",
    ", we list here the results for the @xmath0 functions and their minimizers for the @xmath16 lattices @xcite .",
    "let @xmath17 be the spatial dimension . for @xmath18 ,",
    "the three discrete velocities are @xmath19 . in higher dimensions ,",
    "the discrete velocities are tensor products of the discrete velocities of these one - dimensional velocities .",
    "the @xmath0 function is boltzmann - like : @xmath20    here @xmath21 is the weight associated with the @xmath22th discrete velocity @xmath23 . for @xmath18 , the weights corresponding to the velocities @xmath24 are @xmath25 . for @xmath26 ,",
    "the weights are constructed by multiplying the weights associated with each component direction .",
    "the local equilibrium which minimizes ( [ app : h ] ) subject to the fixed density and momentum reads : @xmath27 the speed of sound , @xmath14 , in this model is @xmath28 .",
    "once the entropy function @xmath0 is found , the basic equation of elbm to be constructed and to be solved is @xmath29    { \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\delta$}}_i[{\\mbox{\\boldmath$f$}}(\\mathbf{r},t)],\\ ] ] where the right hand side represents the collision process .",
    "the @xmath5-dimensional vector function @xmath30 ( so - called bare collision integral ) , must satisfy the conditions : @xmath31 @xmath32 moreover , the local equilibrium vector @xmath33 must be the only zero point of @xmath30 , that is , @xmath34 , and , finally , @xmath33 must be the only zero point of the local entropy production , @xmath35 .",
    "the conditions just listed are standard requirements taken directly from the well known theory of the continuous boltzmann equation .",
    "the lattice specifics comes through the factor @xmath36 $ ] in equation ( [ lbm ] ) . here",
    "@xmath37 is a fixed parameter in the interval @xmath38 $ ] , and is related to the viscosity ( the limit @xmath39 is the zero viscosity limit ) .",
    "the scalar function @xmath40 is the nontrivial root of the nonlinear equation @xcite : @xmath41).\\ ] ] it is the function @xmath40 which ensures the discrete - time @xmath0-theorem , unlike in the continuous - time case where it essentially suffices to ensure only the entropy production inequality .",
    "function @xmath40 has to be computed numerically on each lattice site at each time step . in the fully resolved hydrodynamic limit , when @xmath42 , the solution @xmath43 tends to its limiting value @xmath44 .    in practice ,",
    "construction of the bare collision integral @xmath30 is guided by simplicity . for the @xmath0 functions ( [ app : h ] ) , the local equilibria are given by explicit formula ( [ ted ] ) , and thus the bgk form , @xmath45 becomes available for efficient numerical realizations .",
    "we further refer to this model as the entropic lattice bgk ( elbgk ) .",
    "a gradient single - relaxation time models circumventing the bgk form , and which are readily constructed once just the @xmath0-function is known , were developed in @xcite ( see also their discussion in the context of reaction kinetics , @xcite ) .",
    "the standard ( nonentropic , second - order polynomial ) lbm can be considered as a truncation of the elbm s just discussed .",
    "this truncation is done in three steps .",
    "first , the local equilibria are replaced by their second - order in @xmath46 polynomials .",
    "for example , for @xmath47 , if we expand the local equilibrium ( [ ted ] ) to second order in @xmath48 , we derive the polynomial equilibrium of the standard d2q9 model @xcite . in order to distinguish between the local equilibria when they are minimizers of appropriate entropy functions and the @xmath49th order polynomial approximations to them",
    ", we denote the latter as @xmath50 .",
    "second , instead of nonlinear bare collision integrals one considers linearized forms , @xmath51 .",
    "the simplest option is the bgk form which becomes always available , @xmath52 .",
    "third , when the latter expression is substituted into the right hand side of equation ( [ lbm ] ) , the root of the equation ( [ step ] ) is replaced by @xmath44 .",
    "obviously , these operations do not leave the @xmath0-theorem intact , and it is maybe not surprising that a polynomial can not be itself a minimizer of any entropy function anymore , as was demonstrated for the d2q7 lattice in @xcite .",
    "in the subsequent section we find the @xmath0 function for this lattice without assuming a polynomial ansatz for the equilibrium .",
    "the discrete velocities of the d2q7 model at each site of a planar triangular lattice consist of a zero vector @xmath53 , and of six vectors of equal length , @xmath2 , where @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "the explicit form of the seven - dimensional vectors corresponding to the @xmath56 and @xmath57 components of velocities are as follows :    @xmath58    accordingly , the population vector @xmath6 is , @xmath59 by symmetry arguments , it is sufficient to seek the @xmath0 function of the form , @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are two convex functions of one variable to be determined .",
    "[ we could equally begin with a more general form , @xmath63 , assuming a separate unknown function for each population .",
    "however , the result would be the same . ]",
    "the local equilibrium @xmath33 is the minimizer of the function @xmath0 ( [ htrial ] ) subject to the constraints , @xmath64    let us denote the inverse of the derivative of @xmath65 and @xmath66 as @xmath67^{-1}$ ] and @xmath68^{-1}$ ] .",
    "then , the formal solution to the minimization problem reads , @xmath69 here @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are lagrange multipliers associated with the constraints .    by choosing various pairs of functions for @xmath73 and @xmath74 constitutive relations for the stress tensors ( [ gi ] ) is satisfied with varying degrees of accuracy , and the goal is to find such functions @xmath73 and @xmath74 for which the error reduces to higher orders in the powers of velocity @xmath46 .",
    "we rewrite the constitutive relation ( [ gi ] ) in the form of a discrepancy of the components of the stress tensor as : @xmath75 note that the sound speed is not yet defined in these expressions .",
    "in fact , as we will see soon , the choice of the sound speed is a solvability condition in our procedure .",
    "the next step is crucial @xcite : we are going to find such functions @xmath73 and @xmath74 which contain no discrepancy up to the orders @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 . in order to do this , we expand the terms in equations ( [ defect ] ) to relevant orders around the point @xmath79 : @xmath80 here primes denote corresponding derivatives .    substituting expansions ( [ expansion ] ) in equations ( [ defect ] )",
    ", we require that discrepancy ( [ defect ] ) vanishes to second order in @xmath81 .    at zero order",
    "we have two identical equations : @xmath82 whereupon , @xmath83 there are no terms linear in @xmath81 in the expansion of @xmath84 . at second order",
    "we get the following equations : @xmath85 ^ 2}{\\mu_0(\\chi)+6\\mu(\\chi)}\\right\\ } \\zeta_x^2+\\left(2c_{\\rm s}^2-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\mu''(\\chi ) \\zeta_y^2,\\label{t2xx}\\\\ t^{(2)}_{yy}&=&\\left(\\frac{3}{2}c_{\\rm",

    "thus , setting to zero each term in front of each combination @xmath87 in equations ( [ t2xx ] ) , ( [ t2yy ] ) , and ( [ t2xy ] ) , we obtain five equations : @xmath88 ^ 2}{\\mu_0(\\chi)+6\\mu(\\chi)}=0,\\label{xxx}\\\\ \\left(2c_{\\rm s}^2-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\mu''(\\chi)=0,\\label{xxy}\\\\ \\left(\\frac{3}{2}c_{\\rm s}^2-\\frac{3}{8}\\right)\\mu''(\\chi)=0,\\label{yyx}\\\\ \\left(2c_{\\rm s}^2-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)\\mu''(\\chi ) + \\frac{12[\\mu'(\\chi)]^2}{\\mu_0(\\chi)+6\\mu(\\chi)}=0,\\label{yyy}\\\\ \\frac{12[\\mu'(\\chi)]^2}{\\mu_0(\\chi)+6\\mu(\\chi)}-\\mu''(\\chi)=0 . \\label{xy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equations ( [ xxy ] ) and ( [ yyx ] ) are identical . assuming @xmath89 , equations ( [ xxy ] ) and ( [ yyx ] ) fix the value of sound speed : @xmath90 it is straightforward to demonstrate that with the value of sound speed ( [ ss ] ) the remaining three equations are resolvable . indeed , substituting ( [ ss ] ) into the zero - order relation ( [ zeroe ] ) , we obtain , @xmath91 substituting equations ( [ ss ] ) and ( [ relation ] ) into equations ( [ xxx ] ) , ( [ yyy ] ) , and ( [ xy ] ) , we find out that each of the latter three equations reduce to the same ordinary differential equation : @xmath92 ^ 2 } { \\mu(\\chi ) } - \\mu''(\\chi)=0.\\ ] ] the general solution to this equation is @xmath93 now , from the requirement that @xmath89 we get @xmath94 , and furthermore @xmath95 by required concavity of @xmath0 .",
    "substituting the general solution ( [ diff : gen ] ) into the equation ( [ diff ] ) , we find @xmath96 . from equation ( [ relation ] ) we then have @xmath97 . therefore , @xmath98 , so that @xmath99 , and similarly , @xmath100 , where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are arbitrary constants",
    ". thus , we obtain the family of boltzmann - like @xmath0 function of the 2dq7 model : @xmath103 as is well known , adding a linear combination of the locally conserved quantities to the entropy function is immaterial , so we can fix @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the base of natural logarithm , and @xmath106 : @xmath107 in the next section , we shall study the equilibria corresponding to the entropy function ( [ result2 ] ) ..",
    "by construction , the expansion of the minimizers of @xmath0 ( [ result2 ] ) around the point @xmath108 to the order @xmath109 satisfy all the usual requirements needed to derive the athermal navier - stokes equations ( cf .  ref .",
    "@xcite , see also below for the present case ) .",
    "the exact minimizers are nonpolynomial , and are not always available in a closed form . nevertheless , a glimpse of the full solution is possible since the explicit solution can be computed for a few special cases .",
