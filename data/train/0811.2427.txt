    "recent astrophysical and cosmological observation give precise determination on the relic density of cold dark matter in the range  @xcite @xmath1 .",
    "the well motivated candidate for dark matter ( dm ) is weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) , especially the lightest neutralino .",
    "in addition to the direct and indirect experiments to explore wimp , the large hadron collider has already started to reveal the secret of tev energy and is expected to find several superpartners and to determine their properties .",
    "in particular , the feasibility was investigated to determine the neutralino s mass @xmath2  @xcite and relic abundance @xmath3  @xcite from lhc measurements .",
    "an analogous study has also been done in the context of the linear collider , where accuracy of a similar determination would be much better  @xcite .",
    "however neutralino is found as an apparently stable state in lhc detectors , but may not be the true lsp and therefore not dm in the universe .",
    "instead , it could decay into an even lighter and weakly interacting state , the real lsp , outside the detector .",
    "therefore it is necessary to confirm that we need another measurement of neutralino by direct or indirect experiment and also the mass and relic density should be consistent each other .",
    "moreover , the neutralino relic abundance , as determined at the lhc , may come out convincingly outside the wmap range .",
    "if @xmath3 comes out below wmap range , several solutions have been suggested which invoke non - standard cosmology , e.g. quintessence - driven kination , while preserving the neutralino as the dm in the universe .",
    "however , if at the same time direct and indirect dm searches bring null results , or even worse , the lightest super particle turns out to be charged particle such as scalar tau , this will provide a strong indication against the neutralino nature of dm .",
    "in fact , these inconsistencies can be perfectly explained with axino or gravitino cold dark matter , which is dubbed as e - wimps  @xcite .",
    "therefore this framework give us an opportunity to probe the features of the early universe , since the relic density of e - wimps depends on the reheating temperature @xmath0 .",
    "cosmic lithium problems also can be solved with gravitino dm  @xcite .    in this talk , based on ref .",
    "@xcite , we investigate the determination of reheating temperature in the e - wimp scenario using the possible collider measurement of mass and relic density of nlsp , such as neutralino or stau etc .",
    "the spin-@xmath4 axino ( the fermionic superpartner of an axion ) and the spin-@xmath5 gravitino ( the fermionic superpartner of a graviton ) are both well - motivated e - wimps .",
    "the former arises in susy extensions of models incorporating the peccei - quinn solution to the strong cp problem .",
    "the latter is an inherent ingredient of the particle spectrum of supergravity models .",
    "the characteristic strength of their interactions with ordinary matter is strongly suppressed by a large mass scale , the peccei - quinn scale @xmath6 in the case of axinos and the ( reduced ) planck scale @xmath7 for gravitinos .",
    "the mass of them are very model dependent and can vary from kev up to tev  @xcite for axino and from ev to tev for gravitino . in this work",
    "we want to remain as model - independent as possible and will treat @xmath8 and @xmath9 as free parameters .",
    "the possibility of axinos as cold dm was pointed out in  @xcite , while axinos as warm dm was considered in  @xcite .",
    "the heavy axino was studied in  @xcite .",
    "the gravitino as a cosmological relic was extensively studied in the literature . for more references",
    "refer to  @xcite .",
    "there are two generic ways to produce axinos or gravitinos .",
    "one proceeds via scatterings and decay processes of ordinary particles and sparticles in thermal bath .",
    "its efficiency is proportional to their density in the plasma which is a function of @xmath0 ( _ thermal production _ ) .",
    "the other comes from ( out - of - equilibrium ) decays of the nlsps , after their freeze - out , to e - wimps ( _ non - thermal production _ ) .",
    "the thermal production ( tp ) of axinos and gravitinos is a function of @xmath0  @xcite . for high @xmath0 , both are almost proportional to @xmath0 . for axino  @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is temperature - dependent strong coupling constant , which in the above expression is evaluated at @xmath0 .",
    "note that , @xmath12 , and for gravitino  @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 stands for the gluino mass evaluated at a scale @xmath15 . in the axino case",
    ", there is a sharp drop - off below @xmath16 due to boltzmann suppression factor @xmath17 , with @xmath18 denoting here squark and gluino mass ; at lower @xmath0 superpartner decay processes become dominant but are less efficient  @xcite .    for the non - thermal production ( ntp ) ,",
    "the relic abundance is simply given by = .",
    "[ eq : ntp ] the total abundance of the lsps is the sum of both thermal and non - thermal production contributions and it is natural to expect that the lsp makes up most of cdm in the universe , thus we can write @xmath19 once the neutralino nlsp is discovered and its mass is determined at the lhc with some precision , and so also @xmath20 , then eq .  ( [ eq : oh2relation ] )",
    "will provide a relation between @xmath0 and @xmath21 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     for gravitino lsp , the analogous plots are shown in figures  [ fig : gravitinotr ] and  [ contour_gravitino1 ] . for gravitino lsp , big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn )",
    "gives strong constraint since the lifetime of nlsp is around @xmath22 sec to @xmath23 sec due to the suppressed interaction .",
    "the neutralino nlsp is almost excluded with @xmath24 due to bbn  @xcite .    while @xmath25 is independent of the axino mass , in the gravitino case @xmath26 .",
    "thus @xmath27 while @xmath28 .",
    "in other words , if tp dominates , @xmath29 , we find @xmath30 .",
    "and then ntp dominates , @xmath0 drops down as shown in figure  [ fig : gravitinotr ] ( right panel ) .",
    "the turnover between the tp and ntp dominance allows one to derive a conservative _ upper bound _",
    "@xmath31 which , unlike for the axino cdm , even without knowing the gravitino mass .",
    "this is plotted in fig .",
    "[ contour_gravitino1 ] ( right panel ) .    for stau nlsp case , in our numerical example in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : gravitinotr ] , with @xmath32 , where we have also taken @xmath33 , the condition @xmath34 implies @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "increasing @xmath37 to @xmath38 and @xmath39 to @xmath40 leads to @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "more detailed study on @xmath0 bound with stau nlsp considering only thermal production and using the constraint from bound state effects can be seen in  @xcite .",
    "we studied the possible determination of reheating temperature with axino or gravitino lsp dark matter .",
    "we find that once we know the mass of nlsp and other parameters determining its relic abundance from collider data we can give the reheating temperature depending on the mass of lsp . even though the relic abundance of the nlsp is not measured precisely ,",
    "if the order of magnitude is much smaller or larger than wmap range then we can obtain conservative bound on the reheating temperature .",
    "note added : recently , and long after our work was published , a paper appeared  @xcite which , using a different set of variables ( nlsp stau lifetime and mass , instead of our gravitino mass and nlsp mass ) and neglecting non - thermal contribution to @xmath43 , rederived several of our results .",
    "specifically , with stau mass around @xmath44 , an upper limit on the reheating temperature of @xmath45 was obtained , in agreement with ours .",
