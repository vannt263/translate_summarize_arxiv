    "gx  1 + 4 belongs to a rare class of accreting x - ray pulsars with low mass companion stars .",
    "this pulsar , with a spin period of about two minutes , had a very interesting pulse period history since its discovery ( lewin , ricker , & mcclintock 1971 ) and shows unusual torque - luminosity relation ( paul , rao & singh 1997 , chakrabarty et al .",
    "spin downs observed in gx  1 + 4 in spite of a large accretion rate corresponding to a persistent x - ray luminosity of a few times 10@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 , suggests a very high magnetic field strength of the neutron star , 10@xmath4 g ( makishima et al .",

    "low intensity state , gx  1 + 4 pulse profile has a narrow dip that goes down to 1020% of the average count rate and is believed to be an eclipse caused by the accretion column ( dotani et al .",
    "1989 , galloway et al .",
    "the source also shows some low flux episodes associated with remarkable spectral changes ( naik , paul & callanan 2005 ) .    a low mass companion star and possibility of a very wide orbit with orbital period of about 300 days ( pereira , braga & jablonski 1999 ) or more ( hinkle et al .",
    "2003 ) also makes gx  1 + 4 somewhat unique among the x - ray binaries .",
    "the only other known symbiotic star with a neutron star as the secondary is 4u 1700 + 24 ( galloway et al .",
    ". a velocity of about 250 km s@xmath3 of the stellar wind ( chakrabarty & roche 1997 ) , low compared to the wind velocity in hmxbs , and a low orbital velocity of the neutron star results in a large wind accretion radius around the neutron star .",
    "it is also possible that mass accretion takes place via roche robe overflow of the red giant companion ( pereira et al .",
    "except for the period when it was undetected with exosat , gx  1 + 4 has been one of the brightest hard x - ray sources in the galaxy . the x - ray spectrum of gx  1 + 4 is a simple power - law type , modified at low energies by absorption and at high energies as an exponential cut - off .",
    "a narrow iron k@xmath5 line of varying intensity always adorns the spectrum .",
    "equivalent width of the iron fluorescence line is found to be related to the column density of the absorbing material .",
    "based on this relation , kotani et al .",
    "( 1999 ) suggested that the circumstellar material that causes the absorption and line emission is in the form of a spherical shell at a distance of about 10@xmath6 cm from the neutron star .",
    "we have investigated the x - ray spectrum of gx  1 + 4 at high energy resolution using an observation with the high energy transmission grating ( hetg ) of the chandra x - ray observatory .",
    "this data was supplemented with a simultaneous observation with the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) .",
    "the photoionized wind characteristics of gx  1 + 4 is expected to be different from the well known high mass x - ray binary systems like cen x-3 ( wojdowsky et al . 2003 ) , vela x-1 ( sako et al . 1999 , schulz et al . 2002 ) and gx  3012 ( watanabe et al . 2003 ) due to differences in wind density and velocity . here",
    "we present the observations and the data reduction method in  2 , timing and spectral analysis in  3 followed by a discussion on the results obtained in  4 .",
    "gx  1 + 4 was observed with chandra high energy transmission grating and the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( weisskopf et al .",
    "2002 ) in 2002 from august 5 , 21:34 ut to august 6 14:58 ut , for a duration of 57 ks .",
    "the hetg consists of two transmission gratings , a medium energy grating ( meg ) with an energy range of 0.45.0 kev and a high energy grating ( heg ) with an energy range of 0.810.0 kev .",
    "the dispersed grating spectra are imaged by the imaging spectrometer . based on the spectral information from the ccds",
    ", the grating spectra can be sorted for various grating orders , giving a low background and a first order spectral resolution of 0.023   for the meg and 0.12   for the heg . for chandra",
    "hetg observation with acis - s , event1 mode data was reprocessed using the package chandra interactive analysis of observations ( ciao , version 3.0 ) following the cxc guidelines .",
    "the zeroth - order ccd spectrum was highly affected by pile - up resulting in a low count rate and hard spectrum .",
    "we have , therefore , not used the zeroth - order ccd spectrum for any further analysis . for extraction of the grating spectrum , the zeroth - order source position was determined by analyzing the heg / meg dispersion lines and the data read - out streak of the zeroth order image .",
    "for part of the chandra observation , gx  1 + 4 was also observed simultaneously with the pointed instruments of the rxte giving a wider spectral coverage . for spectral analysis",
    ", we have used data from the proportional counter array ( pca ) of the rxte ( jahoda et al .",
    "1996 ) for a duration of 13 ks within the time range of 06:0713:25 ut on august 6 , 2002 .",
    "ftools version 5.2 was used for reduction of the rxte data and timing analysis . for timing analysis , light curve from a longer time base between august 5 23:38 ut to august 6 14:34 ut",
    "was used with an useful exposure of 28 ks .",
    "the pca standard 1 mode data were used for timing analysis , which covers the entire spectral band of the detectors i.e , 2 - 60 kev .",
    "standard 2 mode data in the band of 3 - 30 kev from three proportional counter units were used for spectral analysis .",
    "from the long term light curve obtained with the rxte all sky monitor it appears that during the present observation and for about 50 days prior to this , the source was in a somewhat low intensity state .",
    "the 220 kev flux during this observation was 3.8@xmath710@xmath8 erg @xmath9 s@xmath3 ( see the section on spectral analysis ) .",
    "the standard 1 mode data of rxte - pca has a time resolution of 0.125 s , and the chandra hetg observation was made with a time resolution of 3.24 s. lightcurves from both rxte and chandra were barycenter corrected for timing analysis .",
    "pulses were clearly detected both with chandra and rxte with a pulse period of 138.170 @xmath10 0.001 s. the lightcurves are shown in figure 1 with a bin size equal to the pulse period . strong pulse to pulse intensity variations can be seen clearly , even in the chandra data .",
    "the pulse profiles , as shown in figure 2 , have a narrow dip , characteristic of gx  1 + 4 in medium and low state",
    ". the broad characteristics of the pulse profile measured with chandra and rxte seem to be identical except for some smearing of the chandra profile due to a poorer time resolution .",
    "near the two edges of the dip , there is a slight difference between the two pulse profiles .      for spectral analysis of the chandra grating spectra",
    ", we created the ancillary response files for the meg and heg + ve and ve first order spectra using a ciao script .",
    "the background subtracted positive and negative first order spectra of both meg and heg were combined along with their response matrices and rebinned to improve statistics for spectral fitting with a ciao thread of tools . at the observed count rate ,",
    "the meg and heg spectrum do not suffer from any pile - up problem .",
    "standard procedure prescribed by the rxte guests observer facility was adopted for background estimation and spectral response generation .    for spectral analysis",
    "we have used the package xspec ( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "we have first fitted the gx  1 + 4 spectra taken with rxte - pca and chandra hetg ( both heg and meg ) simultaneously with a model consisting of a high - energy exponential cutoff power - law , a narrow emission line at 6.4 kev , and line of sight photoelectric absorption ( morrison and mccammon 1983 , model _ wabs _ in xspec ) .",
    "the galactic ridge emission and cxb background components were separately included in the model for rxte - pca spectrum with appropriate normalizations ( valinia & marshall 1998 ) .",
    "for the rxte - pca spectrum , an absorption edge at fixed energy of 4.8 kev was also included in the model to account for the xenon l - shell absorption related uncertainty .",
    "the relative normalization of the model was allowed to vary between the three instruments and the heg / meg normalization constants were about 90% of the same for rxte - pca .",
    "residuals of the heg spectral fit shows some excess photons around 6.9 kev and we have therefore included another one line component at this energy .",
    "the equivalent hydrogen column density of the absorbing material was found to be 2.3@xmath710@xmath11 atoms @xmath9 and the power - law component has a photon index of 0.77 , cutoff energy at 5.6 kev and e - folding energy of 9.8 kev .",
    "there is indication of a very weak soft excess at energies below 1.5 kev , that can be fitted to a blackbody type spectrum with a temperature of @xmath00.1 kev .",
    "however , we refrain from adding such a component to the spectral model as a very weak soft excess can also be produced by small inhomogeneities in the line of sight absorption .",
    "the chandra - hetg and rxte - pca spectra are shown together in figure 3 , along with the model components and the residuals to the best fit model .",
    "a @xmath12 of 623 was obtained for 706 degrees of freedom ( @xmath13 = 0.88 ) , which is an acceptable fit . parameters of the best fit spectral model are given in table 1 .",
    "the 220 kev flux during this observation is 3.8@xmath710@xmath8 erg @xmath9 s@xmath3 , corresponding to a source luminosity of 4.2@xmath710@xmath14 erg s@xmath3 at an assumed distance of 10 kpc .",
    "we would like to mention here that there is a substantial uncertainty in the actual distance to gx  1 + 4 , which affects the luminosity estimate .    to investigate the line emissions in detail",
    ", we further analyzed the meg and heg spectra separately .",
    "the meg spectrum ( 0.35.6 kev ) fits well with an absorbed power - law and there is no prominent emission line in the meg energy band . to inspect the iron k shell energy range in detail",
    "we have fitted a power - law model to the 5.57.5 kev spectrum from heg with a line at 6.4 kev .",
    "the iron fluorescence line has a width of 12@xmath108 ev , smaller than grating energy resolution of @xmath035 ev at 6.4 kev .",
    "the residual to this model clearly shows some excess around 6.95 kev and inclusion of another line component at this energy reduced the @xmath15 by 7 for 93 degrees of freedom , corresponding to a f - test false detection probability of 2.0@xmath710@xmath16 .",

    "the 6.4 kev k@xmath5 fluorescence line from neutral or lowly ionized iron has been observed in gx  1 + 4 many times in the past .",
    "the line equivalent width is usually found to have a dependence on the absorption column density , implying that the line originates from a spherical circumstellar shell .",
    "the very low ionization state of the iron , as derived from the ratio of the line centre energy to the k shell absorption edge energy indicates that the circumstellar shell is at a large distance of about 10@xmath26 cm from the neutron star ( kotani et al .",
    "1999 ) . in the present observation , the equivalent absorption column density , determined very accurately with the chandra detectors , is rather low , 2.3@xmath710@xmath11 atoms @xmath9 .",

    "can also produce a different line equivalent width .",
    "it is also possible that a part of the observed equivalent width of 70 ev may originate from re - processing of hard x - rays in the accretion disk , like the other low mass binary pulsar her x-1 ( endo et al . 2000 ) .",
    "if the orbital period of gx  1 + 4 is correct , the companion star subtends a substantial solid angle to the compact object ( pereira et al .",
    "1999 , also see hinkle et al 2003 ) , hence surface of the companion star can also be a x - ray reprocessing region producing part of the iron fluorescence line .",
    "wind velocity of the red giant companion star ( 250 km s@xmath3 ) , or rotational velocity of matter in the outer accretion disk , both can produce an intrinsic line width of a few ev , comparable to the present measurement .",
    "one important discovery from the present work is the presence of a ly@xmath1 line from hydrogen - like iron and the conspicuous absence of any emission line from helium - like iron . in the x - ray irradiated wind of gx  1 + 4",
    ", we do not detect any emission line from helium - like iron , which in some other sources like in vela x-1 ( sako et al .",
    "1999 , schulz et cl . 2002 ) and cen x-3 ( wojdowsky et al 2003 ) indicates presence of onion - like structures with continuously changing ionization degree and different ionization level of metals .",
    "the uniqueness of gx  1 + 4 is a large alfven radius and a comparatively low wind velocity of the companion star .",
    "it appears that in gx  1 + 4 , the 6.4 kev and the 6.95 kev lines originate from two completely different regions .",
    "one possibility is that while the 6.4 kev fluorescence line originates from cold material very far from the neutron star ( circumstellar shell , and/or accretion disk , surface of companion star ) , the hydrogen - like line originates from a hot gas inside or near the alfven shell , where the ionisation parameter is likely to be high .",
    "similar x - ray spectrum , with a hydrogen - like iron emission line and absence of helium - like line has been detected in her x-1 ( jimenez - garate et al .",
    "2005 ) , another one accreting x - ray pulsar with a medium mass companion star .",
    "if the 6.95 kev line is produced from plasma very close to the neutron star ( a few @xmath27 ) , gravitational redshift will cause line centre energy to shift to lower value . at the same time , the differential redshift over the size of the plasma will also cause the line to broaden . since the line detected with hetg has an upper limit of 40 ev on its width ( 90% confidence limit ) , we do not think that this line is produced very close to the ns surface where gravitational redshift would be important .",
    "we first explore whether the hydrogen - like iron line observed in the gx  1 + 4 spectrum with chandra - hetg can be produced from a mixture of hydrogen - like and fully stripped iron inside the alfven shell .",
    "a fraction of the accretion material , while being transported from the inner accretion disk to the accretion column via the magnetospheric surface , may diffuse inside the magnetospheric boundary .",
    "we presume that outside the magnetosphere , the wind density is very low except in the disks .",
    "the iron atoms in the outer accretion disk or in the circumstellar material are near neutral while iron inside the alfven radius are hydrogen - like or fully stripped . assuming a neutron star radius of 10 km , and a mass of 1.4 m@xmath28 , the alfven radius of gx  1 + 4 in the present state of luminosity ( 4.3@xmath710@xmath14 erg s@xmath3 ) can be expressed as ( frank , king & raine 2002 ) @xmath29 where b@xmath30 is the surface magnetic field strength in unit of 10@xmath26 gauss .",
    "we mention that the discussion here and in the next section is subject to the luminosity based on an assumed distance of 10 kpc , which is rather uncertain .",
    "it is also subject to a bolometric correction to the luminosity compared to the measured flux in the 2 - 20 kev band , which we can not do in absence of simultaneous hard x - ray measurement .    for some fraction of the iron atoms to remain in hydrogen - like state and at the same time not to have a significant amount of helium - like iron ( since we do not detect any helium - like line ) , the ionization parameter ( @xmath31 = @xmath32 ) at the alfven radius should be in the range of 3.5 @xmath24log(@xmath31)@xmath24 4.5 , where @xmath33 is the particle density and @xmath34 is the distance from the neutron star . for log(@xmath31 ) = 3.5",
    ", the particle density at the alfven radius should be @xmath35 with a corresponding thompson optical depth of @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the thickness of the diffused gas inside the alfven radius .",
    "we have simulated the line emissivity from such a photoionized spherical gas cloud with an input power - law x - ray spectrum at the centre , as measured during the present observation . in the simulation , carried out with the xstar package + ( http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/xstar/xstar.html ) , different values of neutron star surface magnetic field was assumed ( b = 10@xmath26 , 10@xmath38 , and 10@xmath39 gauss ) , and different values for the uniform gas density was chosen in such a way that the ionization parameter in each case has a value of log@xmath31 = 3.5 , 4.0 , or 4.5 at the outer boundary of the sphere .",
    "the simulated 6.95 kev line flux from this ionized gas cloud was found to be comparable to the observed line flux of 7@xmath710@xmath40 photons @xmath9 s@xmath3 for the case where b = 10@xmath39 gauss , log(@xmath31 ) = 3.7 , and @xmath41 . a smaller magnetic field ( i.e. smaller alfven radius ) and larger gas density can also produce an equal amount of line flux with a larger thompson optical depth",
    ".    however , such a scenario seems to be implausible because the mass required to be present inside the alfven radius is very large , of the order of @xmath42 gm .",
    "even with a slow infall onto the neutron star at 10% of the free fall velocity , this should produce an unpulsed x - ray luminosity comparable to or greater than the total x - ray luminosity measured during this observation .",
    "in addition , the diffusion rate through a strong magnetic field is expected to be very low ( elsner and lamb , 1984 ) compared to the mass required for production of the observed line intensity .    [",
    "[ line - emission - from - gas - flowing - onto - the - neutron - star - along - the - magnetic - field - lines ] ] line emission from gas flowing onto the neutron star along the magnetic field lines ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    we subsequently examined the line flux expected from material flowing onto the neutron star in the shape of an accretion curtain ( miller 1996 ) over the dipole magnetic field structure as it leaves the inner accretion disk . for a crude estimate of mass in this shell type structure , the material required to produce the observed x - ray luminosity is assumed to flow at 10% of the free - fall time - scale and the solid angle subtended by the accretion curtain to the neutron star is assumed to be @xmath43 steradian . from simulations with xstar we found that irradiation of the accretion curtain by the central x - ray source can produce the observed flux of the 6.95 kev line without producing any other prominent emission line if the thickness of the accretion curtain is about 10% of the alfven radius .",
    "this is in accordance with the fact that in the accretion disks surrounding strongly magnetised neutron stars , the transition zone is known to be rather broad ( ghosh and lamb , 1979 ) .",
    "if the boundary layer is sharp , it causes a larger material density in the accretion curtain and low ionisation parameter and therefore can not produce the observed hydrogen - like iron line , unless the alfven radius is too small .",
    "therefore , it appears that the observed line emission from hydrogen - like iron is produced by x - ray irradiation of gas flowing from the inner accretion disk onto the neutron star along the magnetic field lines rather than material diffused into the alfven sphere .",
    "the 6.95 kev line flux depends critically on the ionisation parameter , and hence on the mass accretion rate and alfven radius / magnetic field strength of the neutron star .",
    "this may explain why such a line has not been detected in the hetg spectrum of other accretion powered x - ray pulsars , except in her x-1 ( jimenez - garate et al .",
    "in gx  1 + 4 , this hydrogen like iron emission line may have a significantly different equivalent width at a different mass accretion rate .",
    "we also note that the detection of this line with the present chandra hetg observation is only at 3@xmath44 level and the upper limit for emission lines from helium - like iron is not very small compared to the line flux of the hydrogen - like iron .",
    "if the 6.95 kev line does indeed originate from the accretion curtain , a flux variation of this line with pulse phase would be expected while the 6.4 kev line flux is independent of the pulse phase ( paul & nagase , 1999 ) .",
    "we have carried out a pulse phase resolved spectroscopy of the heg data with four phase bins , but the very low flux of the 6.95 kev line caused a very low sensitivity for flux variation measurement and the result was inconclusive .",
    "the future astro - e2 x - ray calorimeter , which will have a much higher sensitivity for narrow emission lines and a factor of five better energy resolution in this energy band will be very valuable to unravel the actual line emission mechanism in gx  1 + 4 .",
