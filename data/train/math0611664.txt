    "the main purpose of this section is to show that the conclusions of theorems [ thm : uniform - ratio - bound ] and [ thm : uniform - difference - bound ] may fail if the poisson process governing the arrivals of observations is replaced by an arbitrary renewal process .",
    "the general setup is as follows .",
    "let @xmath375 be i.i.d .",
    "random variables taking values in the positive integers , and assume that @xmath376 are i.i.d .",

    "for each @xmath388 , define @xmath389 it is not difficult to see that @xmath390 , and @xmath391 is a stopping rule for @xmath392 .",

    "similarly , if @xmath27 is @xmath125$]-valued then so is @xmath402 , and theorem  b implies that @xmath403 .",
    "the sharpness of these inequalities depends on the value of @xmath120 : the first bound is sharp if @xmath404 , that is , if @xmath405 .",
