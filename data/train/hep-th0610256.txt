    "it is well known that magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) waves @xmath5 $ ] play an important role in the field of space plasma . in astrophysics",
    ", it remained for a long time the preferred theory in the description of the dynamics of various astrophysical plasma systems such as the formation of the solar corona which is associated with the problem of the plasma heating and the solar wind acceleration @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "indeed , many examples could be given in the application of the mhd theory namely in space plasma , like as the study of the linear properties of the fast magnetosonic propagating in inhomogeneous plasma which is done by several authors @xmath7 $ ] in order to model these waves in coronal loop .",
    "t. k. suzuki et al .",
    "@xmath8 $ ] proposed a collisionless plasma in which the damped fast mhd waves are responsible of the heating and acceleration of winds from rotating stars due to the observational evidence for locally strong magnetic fields in stellar atmospheres .",
    "in cosmology , after the observation of the cosmic microwaves background ( cmb ) radiations in 1965 , it is believed that mhd played a major role in shaping the radiation spectrum during the so - called plasma epoch .",
    "in fact , the evidence that the plasma was magnetized has been confirmed after the measurements of background magnetic fields which are of the order of @xmath9gauss .",
    "moroever , most of the theories predict that these magnetic fields are the amplified remnants of a seed cosmological magnetic field generated in the early universe [ 11 ] .",
    "the presence of such field in the primordial plasma influences the acoustic waves pattern of the cmb anisotropy power spectrum @xmath10 $ ] , e.g. adams et al .",
    "@xmath11 $ ] argued that the primordial density fluctuations that are generated in inflationary universe enter the horizon before the last photon scattering , and initiate magneto - acoustic oscillations in the photon - baryon plasma due to the presence of primordial magnetic fields .",
    "these oscillations distort the primordial spectrum of fluctuations and affect cmb anisotropy .",
    "therefore , dealing with the features of mhd wave dynamics is a significant part of cosmological plasma , and because of the magnetic forces , the theory of mhd is more complicated and fascinating than hydrodynamics itself due to the influence of the magnetic field on the traditional sound waves which consequently transform to slow and fast magneto - acoustic waves .",
    "furthermore , a new kind of wave appears , called alfvn wave , which arises from magnetic tension and propagates along the field lines without disturbing the thermal pressure or density of the plasma .    on the other hand ,",
    "there has been a large interest in the study of physical phenomena on a non commutative ( nc ) spacetime .",
    "the idea of  spacetime noncommutativity is not new and was first discussed by snyder in 1947 @xmath12.$ ] at this time the theory of renormalization was not yet well established and the goal was to introduce a natural cut - off to deal with infinities in quantum field theory .",
    "however this theory was plagued with several problems such as  the violation of unitarity and causality which make people abandoning it .",
    "the appearance of such theory , baptized noncommutative geometry , as a limit of string theory has generated a revival of interest for this theory @xmath13 $ ] .    in the framework of noncommutative geometry the position vector @xmath14",

    "when spacetime is noncommutative on short distance scales , this may have an imprint on early universe physics , and leads to an interesting consequence at a microscopic level .",
    "indeed , it could be one of possible scenarios that may cause the generation of the density perturbations and primordial magnetic fields in the inflationary universe @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "such studies allow to predict some bounds on noncommutativity scale @xmath20 which may have a temperature dependence [ 21 ] .",
    "our work is devoted to study the mhd waves by taking into account the space modification , and focusing on the description of a homogeneous plasma in a non - smooth space .",
    "the aim of this work is to make a theoretical background in the field of ncmhd waves and seek some future works to study this topic . opening",
    "this new window inevitably leads to deal with the interactions of space deformation and plasma waves , which could be considered as a new experimental area for testing space noncommutativity contribution .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the second section",
    "we start with a brief review of noncommutative classical electrodynamics , from which we derive the ncmaxwell equations .",
    "then in the third section , and by assuming a small @xmath26 matrix , we establish the modified mhd equations to first @xmath27parameter for a single conductor medium . as an application , in the fourth section we deal with a particularly interesting case of a high conductor @xmath28 fluid which is considered as plasma medium .",

    "the authors deduced that the phase speed of these waves is different from @xmath72 ( with small modification ) in case of a transverse propagation with respect to the background magnetic field induction , while the parallel propagation propagation is unchanged .",

    "in our study , we focus on the classical behavior of the electromagnetic waves propagating through a plasma with high conductivity in the presence of both , a magnetic field , and nc space . this treatment is based on the classical mhd theory which is worked out in the framework of nc maxwell theory .",

    "this modification plays a role of another velocity which is added to the usual alfvn velocity , consequently , enhances the value of this latter .",

    "however in our study , we consider that the magnetic pressure is dominant in such way that @xmath193 .",
    "according to the fig .",
    "3 , it turns out  that in compressible plasma , the phase velocity related to the fast waves is slightly enhanced due to space noncommutativity .",

    "this extreme modification on the fast which is around @xmath194 which occurs when the propagation is perpendicular ( @xmath195 ) with respect to the mean magnetic field , and becomes smaller with @xmath196 when the fast waves is nearly alfvnic in parallel or anti - parallel . also , the noncommutativity effect on the fast mode is proportional to the phase speed of the wave which varies as a function of the propagation angle .",
    "in contrast , from fig .",
    "4 , the quantity @xmath182 that corresponds to modification rate of the slow mode has a high dependence on plasma @xmath1 variation .",
    "although this rate is much smaller comparing with @xmath181 , the noncommutative effect could slightly appear when plasma @xmath192 is higher than @xmath197 , which means that the noncommutativity affects the slow mode as long as the plasma is strongly compressed ( high @xmath117 ) .",
    "the extreme modification on slow mode occurs mainly in oblique propagations between @xmath198 and @xmath199 , and as it is expected from fig.2 , the noncommutativity effect vanishes for @xmath195 at which originally there is no perpendicular propagation of the slow mode .",
    "in addition , no modification appears on parallel and anti - parallel slow waves which correspond to the maximum phase velocity of this mode .",
    "this means that no proportionality between noncommutativity effect and the phase velocity of the slow wave .",
    "it is important to discuss the interesting physical case when @xmath200 , which means a total domination of the magnetic pressure on compressible plasma due to the strength of the mean constant magnetic field @xmath201 or the plasma is not relatively enough compressed .",

    "while in fig.2 , as it is expected , the slow mode vanishes in case of @xmath206 which is equivalent to the incompressible plasma case .",
    "in this letter , we have studied the propagative phenomenon of the electromagnetic waves in a homogeneous plasma under the effect of a magnetic field and space - space uncertainty . by using a physical model which considers plasma as a high conductor single fluid medium ,",
    "the ideal ncmhd equations are established with the help of nc maxwell theory .",
    "because of a quasi - static motion of the fluid , we neglected the relativistic effect which is very small and it is below the order of @xmath207 . in this treatment , the behavior of the electromagnetic waves propagating in this medium are studied in both cases , incompressible and compressible plasmas .",
    "it turned out that in an incompressible plasma , the alfvn mode undergoes a modification which appears as a small additional velocity which enhances the value of the usual alfvn velocity in commutative space .    on the other hand , it is deduced that the influence of space noncommutativity on the fast waves in a compressible plasma is proportional to the phase velocity .",
    "moreover , the high oblique fast waves undergo a strong modification which is about @xmath208 times higher than the perturbed parameter @xmath174 , and a weak modification occurs in case of nearly parallel and anti - parallel propagation . for the slow mode ,",
    "the influence of space noncommutativity is very small especially when @xmath1 is low than @xmath197 .",
    "this effect could slightly appear when @xmath1 is beyond the value of @xmath209 , at which , the extreme modification on the slow mode occurs in oblique propagations between @xmath198 and @xmath199 , and vanishes in the parallel one .",
    "in addition , for @xmath200 there is no influence of space noncommutativity on slow mode while this influence on the fast mode is nearly identical to that for  @xmath210 which is higher in perpendicular propagation .",
    "the impact of space noncommutativity on cosmological mhd waves properties may lead to new consequences on the study of the influence of such waves on cmb temperature spectrum .",
    "although the effect of the space noncommutativity may decrease after the inflationary universe due to the decreasing in energy scale , the presence of a primordial magnetic field excites any possible effect of space - space uncertainty on the primordial photon - baryon plasma before the last scattering .",
    "any role of space noncommutativity at that time depends on its scale @xmath211 .",
    "several scenarios based on space noncommutativity , aimed to explain the mechanism behind the generation of the primordial magnetic field , hence , possible constraints on @xmath211 parameter have been involved .",
    "in fact , the possibility that @xmath211 has a temperature dependence has been discussed in [ 20 , 21 ] , where the authors mentioned that the world is commutative at low temperature but becomes more noncommutative once the temperature is higher than a certain threshold temperature @xmath212 . in ref . [ 21 ] , an intensive discussion on the temperature dependence of @xmath213-parameter based on the constraints on the primordial magnetic field which is @xmath214 at the beginning of nucleosynthesis ( see ref . [ 31 ] ) , the authors argued that the presence of noncommutativity may be not so efficient beyond nucleosynthesis scale .",
    "however , its effect can not be omitted due to high temperature especially when the radiations dominate the plasma .",
    "hence , this drives our attention , that this effect can be treated as a perturbative correction in the study of the distortion of the primordial spectrum of fluctuations by mhd waves before the last scattering .",
    "as we have seen in this letter , the space noncommutativity influences the compressible oscillations depending on their propagation angle , on the other hand , the fact that the velocity of the fast waves depends on the propagation angle between the wave - number and the magnetic field , the cmb anisotropy would be affected @xmath11 $ ]",
    ". this could reduce the impact of noncommutativity on some branches of the mhd waves , therefore , this leaves imprints on the primordial spectrum of the fluctuations anisotropy .",
    "furthermore , such an influence may also correct the magnitude of the primordial magnetic field , this is because the noncommutativity can play a role of an additional magnetic field applied on the medium .",
    "in addition , dealing with the influence of the ncmhd waves on cmb radiations may provide a better estimation of the scale of @xmath213 parameter during plasma epoch .",
