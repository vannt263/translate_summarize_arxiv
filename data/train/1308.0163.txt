    "the recent identification of the new particle discovered at the lhc as a higgs boson with a mass of 125 gev / c@xmath4 completes the picture of particles and forces described by the standard model @xcite .",
    "however , it does not mark the end of the story as , unfortunately , the standard model is an incomplete description of nature . puzzles still remain , for example , in explaining the existence of dark matter and the matter@xmath5antimatter asymmetry .",
    "search for the effects of fundamental cp symmetry violation ( c is the charge conjugation symmetry and p is space parity ) can shed light on the latter problem . via the cpt theorem",
    "( t is the time - reversal invariance ) , cp violation means also t symmetry nonconservation . in this connection ,",
    "search for the t , p - parity nonconservation effects @xcite including the permanent electric dipole moments ( edm ) of elementary particles and nuclear schiff momenta ( nsm ) , becomes now one of the most intriguing problems of modern physics .",
    "almost half a century ago sandars @xcite and shapiro @xcite realized that very perspective experiments towards the search of violation of fundamental symmetries can be performed on atoms , molecules and solids containing heavy elements .",
    "though the possible cp violation mechanism within the standard model generate too small effects , many extensions to the standard model give rise to such t , p - odd effects which are already in the reach of modern experiments . recently a molecular experiment on the ybf beam has succeed to obtain a very rigid upper bound on the electron edm  @xcite , @xmath6 . up to now , the best limitation on the nuclear t , p - odd interactions was archived in atomic hg experiments @xcite .",
    "the difficulties of all these searches are not only experimental .",
    "to interpret the measured data in terms of the electron edm , nuclear schiff moments etc .",
    "one should know a number of parameters , which are determined by the electronic structures of systems under consideration .",
    "these parameters can not be measured , their evaluation constitute a problem of ab initio electronic structure study that is especially challenging for solids .",
    "there are other properties of interest in different applications which , similar to the t- and p - odd effects , are sensitive to a change of densities of the _ valence _ electrons in _ atomic cores _ : hyperfine magnetic dipole and electric quadruple constants , chemical shifts of x - ray emission lines , volume isotope and mssbauer shifts , etc .",
    "@xcite . in the present paper",
    "we introduce and implement a new method of calculation of the above mentioned characteristics ( describing the state of atoms in solids rather than the chemical bonding and called below the `` core characteristics '' , `` core properties '' or `` core parameters '' for simplicity ) which take account of both relativistic and correlation effects explicitly and , from other side , is valid for the periodic structures . as a first application of this method we have evaluated the parameter @xmath0 ( see below ) that is required to study the t , p - violating interaction in the pbtio@xmath1 crystal .",
    "the use of the pbtio@xmath1 crystal to search for the schiff moment of the @xmath2pb nucleus has recently been suggested by mukhamedjanov and sushkov in ref .",
    "@xcite . according to the authors of  @xcite",
    "one can reach a sensitivity up to ten orders of magnitude better than the current result for hg @xcite . at",

    "the pb and ti atoms are displaced along the tetragonal axis ( `` c '' on fig .",
    "1 ) with respect to their non - ferroelectric positions .",
    "in contrast to a similar ferroelectric phase case in batio@xmath1 , the displacements of the atoms in pbtio@xmath1 are much bigger @xcite .",
    "this leads to a strong ferroelectricity of pbtio@xmath1 which can induce strong internal effective fields .",

    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ interaction ] ) that for the interpretation of measurements in terms of nsm one should know @xmath0 . up",
    "to now only a few models for calculating @xmath0 were considered in crystals . in these models",
    "a local electronic structure in a vicinity of a heavy - atom nucleus was simulated by a cluster of nearest atoms and a system of point charges @xcite or by considering an effective state of pb in oxygen environment @xcite . in the present paper",
    "the @xmath0 parameter is evaluated using a new approach to study the core characteristics in solids . for comparison and accuracy estimation a value of @xmath0 for the @xmath3 state of a @xmath2pbo molecule",
    "has also been considered using the same approximations made in solid state calculations and using two - component relativistic coupled clusters approach with single , double and perturbative triple cluster amplitudes ( ccsd(t ) ) .",
    "solid state calculations can be efficiently performed using the hartree - fock method or density functional theory . in these",
    "approaches the wave function of a crystal is built as a slater determinant of one - electron crystalline orbitals ( cos ) @xmath15 .",
    "the cos are formed as linear combinations of bloch functions @xmath16 . in the approximation of linear combination of atomic orbitals ( lcao ) , the bloch functions are written as ( e.g. , see @xcite ) : @xmath17 where @xmath18 runs over all the lattice vectors , @xmath19 is the atomic coordinate in the zero reference cell on which @xmath20 is centered . by solving the hartree - fock or kohn - sham equations",
    "one obtains the co - lcao expansion coefficients @xmath21 for one - electron eigenstates @xmath15 :    @xmath22    one - electron reduced density matrix in a direct lattice takes the following form :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is a density matrix in a reciprocal lattice and is determined by coefficients @xmath21 .    to calculate the core characteristics in a heavy - element compound",
    ", a four - component relativistic approach is required in general .",
    "however , such four - component calculations are already complicated for molecular systems and become much more difficult for solids .    in the given study we have extended a two - step concept for calculation of heavy - atom core characteristics developed earlier by our group for molecules @xcite on the case of periodic structures ( solids ) . the new implementation of the concept is as follows .",
    "firstly , an electronic calculation for valence and outer - core electrons is performed using the dft or hartree - fock method for a given crystal .",
    "inner - core electrons of heavy atoms are excluded from calculations using the generalized relativistic effective core potential ( grecp ) method @xcite . secondly ,",
    "since the inner - core parts of the valence one - electron `` pseudo - wavefunctions '' are smoothed in the grecp calculations , they have to be recovered using some core - restoration method @xcite before using them to evaluate the core characteristics .",
    "the non - variational restoration , which is based on a proportionality of valence and virtual spinors in the inner - core region of heavy atoms , is used presently , in which one generates _",
    "equivalent _ basis sets of one - center four - component spinors @xmath25 and smoothed two - component pseudospinors @xmath26 in all - electron dirac - fock(-breit ) and grecp / scf calculations of the same configurations of a considered atom and its ions @xcite .",
    "in addition a basis set of one - component functions @xmath27 is generated , where @xmath28 denotes spatial and eigen - spin variables .",
    "@xmath27 are then expanded in the basis set of one - center two - component atomic pseudospinors @xmath29    the atomic two - component pseudospinors are replaced by equivalent four - component spinors while the expansion coefficients from eq .",
    "( [ expansion ] ) are preserved : @xmath30    one - component @xmath31 functions can be expanded in the basis of @xmath32 functions .",
    "this operation corresponds to a similarity transformation of the density matrix : @xmath33 where @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) is a density matrix in the basis of @xmath32 ( @xmath36 ) functions .",
    "a mean value of one - electron operator @xmath37 corresponding to a core property on a given atom in the zero reference cell can be evaluated as follows : @xmath38 where @xmath39 are matrix elements of operator @xmath37 in the basis of four - component functions @xmath36 . in the current implementation of restoration procedure",
    "the _ one - component _ functions @xmath32 are taken in the form of contracted gaussians that leads to analytical integration at step ( [ transf ] ) .",
    "the developed code was interfaced to use the periodic density matrix ( [ denmat ] ) calculated by crystal09 code @xcite . to perform the grecp / restoration evaluation of core characteristics in _ molecules _ with the spin - orbit effects taken into account at the grecp calculation stage",
    ", the code is also developed to the case when the _ two - component _ molecular spinors @xmath40 are used .",
    "the code is interfaced to use the two - component density matrices obtained in grecp calculations using the dirac12 @xcite and mrcc @xcite codes .",
    "it was shown in a number of papers @xcite that commonly used density functionals , such as pbe @xcite and pw91 @xcite , give extremely poor predictions of volume and strain of ferroelectrics such as pbtio@xmath1 and batio@xmath1 .",
    "a modified ( wc ) exchange density functional exploiting the generalized gradient approximation was proposed by wu and cohen in ref .",
    "it was shown that the exchange wc functional significantly improves prediction of structural properties over the other popular functionals .",
    "more recently , a hybrid b1-wc functional was suggested which gives rather good description of both structural and electronic properties of ferroelectric oxides @xcite .",
    "the latter functional was applied in the present paper for calculation of the valence electronic structure of tetragonal pbtio@xmath1 , whereas the @xmath41 inner - core electrons of pb were excluded from the calculation using the valence ( semi - local ) version of grecp @xcite taken from our previous studies @xcite . to describe pb in the pbtio@xmath1 crystal a new basis set consisting of @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44",

    "the positions of atoms _ _ u__@xmath45 are given in terms of the lattice constants .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     it follows from table [ tdftresults ] that the spin - orbit contribution to @xmath0 at the ccsd(t ) level is about 5% .",
    "the scalar - relativistic b1-wc calculation of @xmath0 parameter reproduces the scalar - relativistic ccsd(t ) value almost exactly .",
    "moreover , all of the density functional based descriptions also reproduce the spin - orbit contributions with good accuracy .",
    "in contrast , the hartree - fock method gives rather poor prediction of both spin - orbit contribution and the total value . a correlation contribution estimated as a difference between the dft and hf results",
    "is about three times bigger for the solid state case ( see above ) .",
    "this can indirectly explain the failure of describing the properties of pbtio@xmath1 ferroelectric phase by the most popular exchange - correlation functionals mentioned in @xcite .",
    "taking into account these results and a more complicated structure of pbtio@xmath1 crystal one can expect an error of 15% for the solid - state results .",
    "a new method that is based on the two - step concept of calculation of core - localized characteristics in solids is proposed and implemented .",
    "the developed approach is applied to evaluation of the @xmath0 parameter of t , p - odd interaction in a periodic model of the pbtio@xmath1 crystal .",
    "the calculated interaction energy is found to be @xmath46 .",
    "the accuracy of the developed method for the case of dft treatment of electronic correlations is investigated and estimated as 15% for the considered system .",
    "it can be increased further by explicit treatment of correlation effects in solids within the coupled clusters approach , though this method is not generally available to - date for calculation of periodic systems .",
