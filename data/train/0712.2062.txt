    "collective motion phenomena in nature have attracted the interest of scientists and other authors for quite a long time  @xcite .",
    "the question of the advantage of living and moving in groups , for instance , is a favorite one among evolutionary biologists  @xcite . in a different perspective",
    ", physicists are mostly concerned with the mechanisms at the origin of collective motion , especially when it manifests itself as a true , non - trivial , emerging phenomenon , i.e. in the absence of some obvious cause like the existence of a leader followed by the group , a strong geometrical constraint forcing the displacement , or some external field or gradient felt by the whole population .",
    "moreover , the ubiquity of the phenomenon at all scales , from intra - cellular molecular cooperative motion to the displacement in group of large animals , raises , for physicists at least , the question of the existence of some universal features possibly shared among many different situations .",
    "one way of approaching these problems is to construct and study minimal models of collective motion : if universal properties of collective motion do exist , then they should appear clearly within such models and thus could be efficiently determined there , before being tested for in more elaborate models and real - world experiments or observations .",
    "such is the underlying motivation of recent studies of collective motion by a string of physicists  @xcite . among them ,",
    "the group of tamas vicsek has put forward what is probably the simplest possible model exhibiting collective motion in a non - trivial manner .    in the `` vicsek model ''  @xcite",
    ", point particles move off - lattice at constant speed @xmath0 , adjusting their direction of motion to that of the average velocity of their neighbors , up to some noise term accounting for external or internal perturbations ( see below for a precise definition ) . for a finite density of particles in a finite box",
    ", perfect alignment is reached easily in the absence of noise : in this fluctuation - less collective motion , the macroscopic velocity equals the microscopic one . on the other hand , for",
    "strong noise particles are essentially non - interacting random walkers and their macroscopic velocity is zero , up to statistical fluctuations .",
    "vicsek _ et al .",
    "_ showed that the onset of collective motion occurs at a finite noise level .",
    "in other words , there exists , in the asymptotic limit , a fluctuating phase where the macroscopic velocity of the total population is , on average , finite .",
    "working mostly in two space dimensions , they concluded , on the basis of numerical  @xcite simulations , that the onset of this ordered motion is well described as a novel non - equilibrium continuous phase transition leading to long range order , at odds with equilibrium where the continuous xy symmetry can not be spontaneously broken in two space dimensions and below  @xcite .",
    "this brought support to the idea of universal properties of collective motion since the scaling exponents and functions associated to such phase transitions are expected to bear some degree of universality , even out of equilibrium .",
    "the above results caused a well - deserved stir and prompted a large number of studies at various levels  @xcite .",
    "in particular , two of us showed that the onset of collective motion is in fact discontinuous  @xcite , and that the original conclusion of vicsek _ et al .",
    "_ was based on numerical results obtained at too small sizes  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the discontinuous character of the transition was challenged in two publications , one by the vicsek group  @xcite and another by aldana _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite .    here , after a definition of the models involved ( section  [ models ] )",
    ", we come back , in section  [ transition ] , to this central issue and present a rather comprehensive study of the onset of collective motion in vicsek - style models . in section",
    "[ ordered ] , we describe the ordered , collective motion phase . section  [ discussion ] is devoted to a general discussion of our results together with some perspectives .",
    "most of the numerical results shown were obtained in two space dimensions , but we also present three - dimensional results . wherever no explicit mention is made , the default space dimension is two .",
    "similarly , the default boundary conditions are periodic in a square or cubic domain .",
    "let us first recall the dynamical rule defining the vicsek model  @xcite .",
    "point particles labeled by an integer index @xmath1 move off - lattice in a space of dimension @xmath2 with a velocity @xmath3 of fixed modulus @xmath4 .",
    "the _ direction _ of motion of particle @xmath1 depends on the average velocity of all particles ( including @xmath1 ) in the spherical neighbourhood @xmath5 of radius @xmath6 centered on @xmath1 .",
    "the discrete - time dynamics is synchronous : the direction of motion and the position of all particles are updated at each timestep @xmath7 , in a driven , overdamped manner : @xmath8 \\label{evicsek}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is a normalization operator ( @xmath10 ) and @xmath11 performs a random rotation uniformely distributed around the argument vector : in @xmath12 , @xmath13 is uniformely distributed around @xmath14 inside an arc of amplitude @xmath15 ; in @xmath16 , it lies in the solid angle subtended by a spherical cap of amplitude @xmath17 and centered around @xmath14 .",
    "the particles positions @xmath18 are then simply updated by streaming along the chosen direction as in @xmath19 note that the original updating scheme proposed by vicsek _",
    "_ in  @xcite defined the speed as a backward difference , although we are using a forward difference . the simpler updating above , now adopted in most studies of vicsek - style models , is not expected to yield different results in the asymptotic limit of infinite size and time .",
    "the `` angular '' noise term in the model defined above can be thought of as arising from the errors committed when particles try to follow the locally - averaged direction of motion .",
    "one could argue on the other hand that most of the randomness stems from the evaluation of each interaction between particle @xmath1 and one of its neighbors , because , e.g. , of perception errors or turbulent fluctuations in the medium .",
    "this suggests to replace eq.([evicsek ] ) by : @xmath20   \\label{en2}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is a random unit vector and @xmath22 is the number of particles in @xmath5 .",
    "it is easy to realize that this `` vectorial '' noise acts differently on the system . while the intensity of angular noise is independent from the degree of local alignment , the influence of the vectorial noise decreases with increasing local order .      in the original formulation of the vicsek model as well as in the two variants defined above",
    ", the only interaction is _",
    "alignment_. in a separate work  @xcite , we introduced a two - body repulsion / attraction force , to account for the possibility of maintaining the cohesion of a flock in an infinite space ( something the vicsek model does not allow ) . here , we only study models without cohesion .",
    "nevertheless , we have considered , in the following , the case of a pairwise repulsion `` force '' , to estimate in particular the possible influence of the absence of volume exclusion effects in the basic model , which leaves the local density actually unbounded .",
    "we thus introduce the short ranged , purely repulsive interaction exerted by particle @xmath23 on particle @xmath1 : @xmath24^{-1 } \\ ; , \\label{eforce2}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the unit vector pointing from particle @xmath1 to @xmath23 and @xmath26 is the typical repulsion range . equations ( [ evicsek ] ) and ( [ en2 ] ) are then respectively generalized to @xmath27 \\label{evicsek2}\\ ] ] and @xmath28\\ ; ,   \\label{en3}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 measures the relative strength of repulsion with respect to alignment and noise strength .",
    "the natural order parameter for our polar particles is simply the macroscopic _ mean velocity _ , conveniently normalized by the microscopic velocity @xmath0 @xmath30 where @xmath31 stands for the average over the whole population . here",
    ", we mostly consider its modulus @xmath32 , the _ scalar order parameter_.    in the following , we set , without loss of generality , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and express all time- and length - scales in terms of these units .",
    "moreover repulsive force will be studied by fixing @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "this leaves us with two main parameters for these models : the noise amplitude @xmath37 and the global density of particles @xmath38 .",

    "however , it was later shown in  @xcite that beyond the typical sizes considered originally the _ discontinuous _ nature of the transition emerges , irrespective of the form of the noise term . recently , the discontinuous character of the transition was argued to disappear in the limit of small @xmath0  @xcite .",

    "@xcite does possess localized , propagating solitary solutions rather similar to bands  @xcite .",
    "although the stability of these solutions need to be further investigated , these results indicate that these objects are robust and that their existence is guaranteed beyond microscopic `` details '' .",
    "however , the emergence of regular , stable , bands and sheets is obviously conditioned to the shape and the boundary conditions of the domain in which the particles are allowed to move . in rectangular domains with at least one periodic direction , these objects can form , span across the whole domain , and move .",
    "but in , say , a circular domain with reflecting boundary conditions , they can not develop freely , being repeatedly `` frustrated '' .",
    "nevertheless , simulations performed in such a geometry indicate that the transition remains discontinuous , with the ordered phase consisting of one or several dense packets traveling along the circular boundary .",

    "however , one may suspect that intrinsic fluctuations are crucial in the systems considered here if only because some of the effective noise terms will be multiplicative in the density .",
