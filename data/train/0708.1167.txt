    "our approach has the benefit of being  berry - phase - free \" in the sense that it does not need to call for a berry phase argument to explain the smf and demonstrates the newtonian nature of the conversion of the magnetic response of electronic spins into an electrostatic voltage drop .",
    "this is further illustrated with classical dynamical simulations for a system of classical magnetic dipoles in a rotating magnetic field mimicing the dw .",
    "in addition we show that if one abandons the stoner model and accounts for a non - spin component of the magnetic moments forming the dw , the cancellation between the smf and the zeeman potential is incomplete , leaving behind a non - zero net smf , which can be experimentally measured .",
