    "over the past few decades , real - time instability of the system of chiral fermions coupled to dynamical gauge fields has been attracting a lot of attention in various fields of physics , ranging from astrophysics to condensed matter physics .",
    "this instability manifests itself in the decay of the initial imbalance between the densities of the left- and right - handed fermions at the expense of the generation of magnetic fields with nonzero magnetic helicity ( or , in other words , winding number of magnetic flux lines ) . in the astrophysical context",
    ", the phenomenon of chiral plasma instability is actively discussed as the mechanism responsible for the generation and enhancement of primordial magnetic fields @xcite as well as for the transfer of magnetic field energy from short to cosmological scales @xcite .    in the context of condensed matter physics ,",
    "chiral plasma instability was initially discussed and experimentally detected as the so - called helical instability of liquid @xmath0he @xcite .",
    "it was also considered as a mechanism of spontaneous magnetization of topological magnetic insulators @xcite . in experiments",
    "in which chirally imbalanced weyl semimetal states are created from dirac semimetals by applying parallel electric and magnetic fields @xcite chiral plasma instability might manifest itself in the spontaneous emission of circularly polarized terahertz - range electromagnetic radiation @xcite .    in heavy - ion collisions , chiral plasma instability might lead to enhanced emission of circularly polarized soft photons @xcite .",
    "it should be also important for the correct estimate of the lifetimes of chirality imbalance and magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "however , the estimates of @xcite suggest that in heavy - ion collisions the volume and the lifetime of the quark - gluon plasma might be too small for the instability to develop .",
    "the origin of this instability of chirally imbalanced dirac fermions is the chiral magnetic effect ( cme ) @xcite - electric current flowing parallel to the magnetic field in the presence of chirality imbalance . within the linear response approximation",
    "the contribution of cme to the electric current is @xmath1 the commonly quoted value for the chiral magnetic conductivity @xmath2 is @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the so - called chiral chemical potential which parameterizes the difference between the fermi levels of right- and left - handed fermions and hence also the total axial charge of the system .",
    "the value of @xmath2 , however , strongly depends on frequency @xmath5 and wave vector @xmath6 of electromagnetic field , and , in the limit of constant and homogeneous magnetic field , on the way in which the limits @xmath7 and @xmath8 are taken @xcite .    in order to see how the cme current ( [ cme_current ] ) can lead to instability , one can insert it into the classical maxwell equations , along with the conventional ohmic current @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the electric conductivity . assuming the unbroken translational invariance both in time and space ,",
    "we can write these so - called anomalous maxwell equations @xcite in frequency - momentum space as @xmath11 from these equations we find the following four - branch dispersion relation for transversely polarized plane waves with the wave vector @xmath12 @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 label different branches of the dispersion relation .",
    "the corresponding polarization vectors @xmath16 for the electric field @xmath17 correspond to circularly polarized waves with opposite helicities ( handedness ) for opposite @xmath18 .",
    "while for nonzero electric conductivity @xmath10 the imaginary part of @xmath5 in ( [ anomalous_maxwell_dispersion ] ) is always positive and hence corresponds to decaying plane waves , nonzero chiral magnetic conductivity can also lead to exponentially growing solutions if the absolute value of the wave vector @xmath19 is smaller than @xmath2 . from ( [ anomalous_maxwell_dispersion ] )",
    "it is also easy to see that for a given wave vector @xmath6 , only one of two helical mode will exhibit exponential growth .",
    "for example , for @xmath20 ( and hence @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) and @xmath23 the exponentially growing solution has the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 is an arbitrary amplitude and @xmath26 .",
    "it is important to stress that since this solution grows monotonously in time , here we use the terms `` circular polarization '' , `` handedness '' and `` helicity '' to describe the rotation of the vectors @xmath17 and @xmath27 along the @xmath28 axis , rather than in time .",
    "the growth of long - wavelength electromagnetic waves and the decay of short - wavelength waves predicted by the anomalous maxwell equations ( [ anomalous_maxwell ] ) is a novel mechanism for the inverse cascade in relativistic magnetohydrodynamics @xcite , which transfers energy from long- to short - wavelength helical magnetic fields .",
    "the fact that the exponentially growing solution ( [ exp_growing_solution ] ) has the helical structure of the form ( [ exp_growing_solution ] ) also suggests the mechanism which can stop the growth of electromagnetic field at later times .",
    "namely , let us recall that for massless chiral fermions the time evolution of the axial charge is governed by the anomaly equation : @xmath29 where the axial charge @xmath30 is defined as the difference between the charges @xmath31 and @xmath32 of the right- and left - handed fermions , @xmath33 is the electromagnetic coupling constant and we have integrated over space to get rid of the spatial divergence of the axial current . for simplicity , in this paper we consider only a single flavor of dirac fermions with electromagnetic coupling @xmath34 .    for the exponentially growing solution ( [ exp_growing_solution ] )",
    "the product @xmath35 is negative : @xmath36 .",
    "is only possible for exponentially growing or decaying solutions .",
    "e.g. circularly polarized electromagnetic waves in a dissipationless medium always have @xmath37 . ] the anomaly equation ( [ volume_integrated_anomaly ] ) then dictates that the time derivative @xmath38 of the axial charge is negative .",
    "since we have assumed @xmath21 , @xmath20 , we see that the growing helical solution ( [ exp_growing_solution ] ) will result in the decrease of @xmath39 and hence of @xmath4 .",
    "this depletion of chirality imbalance should eventually suppress the chiral magnetic conductivity in ( [ cme_current ] ) and hence slow down or stop completely the exponential growth in ( [ exp_growing_solution ] ) .",
    "however , the above analysis of the chiral plasma instability , which follows @xcite , essentially relies on an assumption that the electric current takes the form @xmath40 with constant ohmic and chiral magnetic conductivities .",
    "in reality , both @xmath10 and @xmath2 depend on the frequency and wave vector of electromagnetic field in a nontrivial way @xcite .",
    "one can also expect a strong dependence of @xmath10 and @xmath2 on the spatial and temporal modulation of the axial charge density , which will in general appear at late evolution times @xcite .",
    "moreover , as the instability might lead to quite large strengths of electric and magnetic fields , nonlinear effects beyond the linear response result ( [ cme_current ] ) might become important .",
    "using linear response approximation to describe the interactions between the fermions and the electromagnetic fields is in fact similar to the lyapunov analysis of the full quantum evolution , which is in general nonlinear .",
    "what concerns inter - fermion interactions , so far they were taken into account only indirectly , by using the relaxation time approximation @xcite or the decoherence of the fermionic wave functions @xcite .",
    "a consistent inclusion of all these effects in the anomalous maxwell equations ( [ anomalous_maxwell ] ) would be certainly difficult with approaches based e.g. on the chiral kinetic theory @xcite , chiral hydrodynamics @xcite or the langevin - type effective theory @xcite .",
    "this situation clearly calls for a more first - principle description of the real - time dynamics of chirally imbalanced plasma which would overcome these limitations and approximations . in this paper",
    ", we report on the numerical study of the real - time chiral plasma instability within the framework of the so - called classical statistical field theory ( csft ) @xcite , which captures the first nontrivial order of the expansion of the full quantum evolution operator in powers of the planck constant .",
    "csft is currently the state - of - the art method for numerical simulations of real - time quantum evolution .",
    "the csft approximation is justifiable as long as the characteristic occupation numbers of the physically relevant gauge field modes are large .",
    "that is , the dynamics of the gauge fields should be almost classical .",
    "on the other hand , the real - time dynamics of fermions is exact in csft .",
    "taking into account that in all previous studies gauge fields were also treated classically , the applicability of the csft approach is obviously wider than that of the previously used approaches .",
    "an approach very similar to csft has been recently used in @xcite to study the real - time dynamics of cme .",
    "however , in this work the back - reaction of fermions on the electromagnetic field , which is the origin of the chiral plasma instability , was not taken into account .",
    "the real - time dynamics of axial charge was also studied in @xmath41-dimensional abelian higgs model in the pioneering work @xcite .",
    "our studies are based on the non - compact formulation of lattice quantum electrodynamics , which avoids potential problems with monopole condensation in the strong - coupling phase @xcite . for fermions",
    ", we use the massless wilson - dirac hamiltonian which has a low - energy chiral symmetry . at sufficiently high energies",
    ", this symmetry is broken due to the wilson term . in the condensed matter context , this breaking is a natural feature of any model description of dirac and weyl semimetals @xcite . in section  [ sec : chirality_pumping ]",
    "we demonstrate that the effect of this explicit breaking is , however , not very large ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "therefore we hope that our results should be also at least qualitatively relevant in the context of high - energy physics , where the chiral symmetry is exact at the level of the lagrangian , or tends to be exact at sufficiently high energies .     in the single - particle dirac hamiltonian . on the right : by filling more right - handed eigenstates and less left - handed eigenstates ( or vice versa).,title=\"fig:\",width=113 ]   in the single - particle dirac hamiltonian .",
    "on the right : by filling more right - handed eigenstates and less left - handed eigenstates ( or vice versa).,title=\"fig:\",width=113 ] +    in order to introduce the initial chirality imbalance , we have started the simulations with a state in which more right - handed eigenstates and less left - handed eigenstates are filled , as depicted on the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : init_mua_methods ] .",
    "such a state is an excited state of the many - body dirac hamiltonian , even in the absence of electromagnetic fields .",
    "it is an idealized description of the result of `` chirality pumping '' process in parallel electric and magnetic fields @xcite or in intense circularly polarized laser beams .",
    "alternatively , we have also considered the introduction of the chiral chemical potential into the single - particle dirac hamiltonian , which changes the energies of the right- and the left - handed dirac points ( see left panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : init_mua_methods ] ) .",
    "such initial state has nonzero axial charge but is still the ground state of the many - body hamiltonian in the absence of interactions with electromagnetic fields . in simulations which started from this state",
    "we have not found any signatures of instability or the transfer of helicity from fermions to electromagnetic fields .",
    "the axial charge density exhibited only small fluctuations on top of the large mean value .",
    "presumably , the reason for such a behavior is that nonzero chiral chemical potential corresponds to the physical situation in which our system is connected to an infinite reservoir of axial charge , which is capable of maintaining its initial value at a constant level .",
    "since the anomaly equation ( [ volume_integrated_anomaly ] ) holds also at nonzero chiral chemical potential , this also implies that the magnetic helicity can only exhibit small fluctuations , possibly related to the violation of the anomaly equation due to lattice artifacts . since",
    "such behavior is not really interesting , we do not discuss this setup in what follows .",
    "the structure of this paper is the following : in section [ sec : methods ] we start with a brief summary of the details of our numerical csft algorithm . in appendix",
    "[ apdx : csft_derivation ] we provide a more detailed derivation of this algorithm with a bias towards non - relativistic field theories and condensed matter systems , which might hopefully complement the existing literature on csft ( see e.g. @xcite for derivations which are more in the spirit of relativistic quantum field theory ) . in this appendix",
    "we also demonstrate explicitly the absence of any nontrivial jacobian in the integration measure in the csft algorithm , and discuss some practical aspects of our csft simulations on parallel computers . in section [ sec : chirality_pumping ]",
    "we present the results of the simulations of the chirality pumping process .",
    "first , we consider chirality pumping in external parallel electric and magnetic fields in the absence of backreaction and verify the validity of the anomaly equation ( [ volume_integrated_anomaly ] ) in our numerical setup .",
    "after that we consider the effect of backreaction of fermionic current on the chirality pumping process and demonstrate that the dynamical screening of the external electric field prevents the system from acquiring large axial charge density at late evolution times .    in section [ sec : chiral_instability ] , we consider the decay of the initial chiral imbalance and the generation of electromagnetic fields with nonzero helicity . in order to trigger the decay , we start simulations with several initially excited modes of electromagnetic field . following the energies of helical modes in momentum space ,",
    "we demonstrate that only long - wavelength modes of definite helicity grow and all other modes decay with time .",
    "this is a direct numerical evidence of the inverse cascade phenomenon @xcite due to chiral plasma instability .",
    "we find , however , that the dependence of the strength of the inverse cascade on the initial conditions and parameters of the simulations is significantly more complex than predicted by the anomalous maxwell equations ( [ anomalous_maxwell ] ) .",
    "in particular , in the simulations which exhibit most rapid growth of helical magnetic fields the axial charge does not decay at all . correspondingly , the mechanism which stops the inverse cascade in our simulations is not related to the axial charge decay , again in contrast to the expectations based on the equations ( [ anomalous_maxwell ] ) @xcite .",
    "rather , we observe that in most simulations which do exhibit axial charge decay the inverse cascade emerges for the electric rather than for magnetic fields . in section [ sec : conclusions ]",
    "we conclude with a general discussion of our results and an outlook .",
    "we consider the many - body fermionic hamiltonian coupled to dynamical non - compact electromagnetic fields on the lattice , so that the full hamiltonian @xmath42 of our system is @xmath43 .",
    "the fermionic hamiltonian @xmath44 reads @xmath45 where the labels @xmath46 , @xmath47 denote the sites of the three - dimensional cubic lattice , @xmath48 , @xmath49 are the spinor - valued fermionic creation and annihilation operators which satisfy the anti - commutation relation @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the massless single - particle wilson - dirac hamiltonian with the wilson coefficient @xmath52 : @xmath53 here @xmath54 is the vector potential of the lattice gauge field , @xmath55 denotes the unit lattice vector in the direction @xmath56 , @xmath57 is the fermi velocity , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the dirac @xmath58- and @xmath60-matrices and @xmath61 is the generator of chiral rotations : @xmath62 where @xmath63 are the pauli matrices . in ( [ h_wd ] )",
    "we have assumed that the lattice spacing is unity .",
    "thus in what follows all dimensionful quantities are expressed in units of the lattice spacing .    the lattice hamiltonian @xmath64 of electromagnetic field is the straightforward lattice discretization of the corresponding continuum hamiltonian : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the external current ( which is required , e.g. , to switch the external electric and magnetic fields on and off ) and the operator of the magnetic field strength tensor @xmath67 is defined in terms of the finite differences of the vector potential operator @xmath68 as @xmath69 the operators of the electric field @xmath70 and the vector potential @xmath68 are canonically conjugate and satisfy the commutation relations @xmath71 } = -i \\delta_{xy } \\delta_{ij}}$ ] .",
    "we impose periodic boundary conditions in all spatial directions both for the gauge and the fermionic fields",
    ".    in our csft algorithm , described in detail in appendix [ apdx : csft_derivation ] , we numerically solve the classical equations of motion of the electromagnetic field with the hamiltonian ( [ h_em ] ) @xmath72 where the initial value of the time derivative @xmath73 is the initial value of the electric field @xmath74 and @xmath75 is the vacuum expectation value of the fermionic electric current , which can be calculated as @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the single - particle operator of electric current , @xmath78 is the quantum evolution operator defined by the single - particle schrdinger equation @xmath79 } u { \\left ( 0 , t \\right ) } , \\quad u { \\left ( 0 , 0 \\right ) } = i , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath80 is the initial density matrix which characterizes the initial occupation numbers @xmath81 of single - particle states @xmath82 : @xmath83 in our case , @xmath82 are the eigenstates of the single - particle hamiltonian ( [ h_wd ] ) .",
    "if some occupation numbers are exactly zero ( which can be the case at zero temperature ) , some components of the quantum evolution operator @xmath84 completely decouple and can be discarded in the solution of the equation ( [ single_particle_schrodinger ] ) .",
    "this can be used to speed up the algorithm , typically by a factor of two ( for a standard zero - temperature fermi distribution ) .",
    "the expectation value @xmath75 in ( [ continuum_maxwell ] ) describes the effect of backreaction of fermions on the electromagnetic fields .",
    "we thus have a closed set of equations ( [ continuum_maxwell ] ) , ( [ fermionic_current_vev ] ) and ( [ single_particle_schrodinger ] ) , which allows to evolve the fermionic quantum states and the classical electromagnetic fields in a self - consistent way",
    ". one can also explicitly check that this evolution conserves the total energy @xmath85 of electromagnetic field and fermions up to the work done by the external current @xmath86 : @xmath87 we have solved the evolution equations ( [ continuum_maxwell ] ) and ( [ single_particle_schrodinger ] ) using the leap - frog integrator , which slightly violates the conservation of energy ( [ energy_conservation ] ) . at sufficiently small time step this violation is completely under numerical control , see fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_joint ] in the appendix [ apdx : csft_derivation ] .    in the csft approach",
    ", one can also partially take into account the quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic fields , encoded in the nontrivial wigner transform @xmath88 of the initial density matrix @xmath89 , where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the initial values of electric and magnetic fields . to this end",
    "one should additionally average all observables over @xmath92 and @xmath93 , sampled with the probability @xmath88 .",
    "however , in our work we have not taken these initial quantum fluctuations into account for the following reasons . first ,",
    "in the case of anomaly equation ( [ volume_integrated_anomaly ] ) with massless fermions we have found that the effect of initial fluctuations of electromagnetic fields is much more significant than in the case of e.g. schwinger pair production @xcite with @xmath94 ( so that only the ground state energies @xmath95 contribute ) have little effect on the schwinger pair production rate .",
    "correspondingly , only a few samples of @xmath92 and @xmath93 are enough for reliably computing the expectation values . ] , and hence much more samples of the initial fields are required to reach acceptable statistical errors . partially this can be explained by the large value of the electromagnetic coupling constant , which was @xmath96 in most of our simulations .",
    "we expect that the role of initial fluctuations will be smaller for a smaller value of @xmath33 , say , @xmath97 . in the latter case , however , the characteristic time scale of the chiral plasma instability increases significantly above our current simulation times .",
    "in addition , taking into account initial quantum fluctuations of electromagnetic fields makes it impossible to assume spatial homogeneity of electromagnetic fields along some of the lattice directions , which is essential to speed up the csft simulations at large lattice sizes .",
    "thus while the effect of quantum fluctuations on the chiral plasma instability might be potentially very significant and interesting , we can not study it with our presently available computational resources and leave it for the future work . in this work",
    ", we avoid the statistical averaging over the initial values of the fields @xmath93 , @xmath92 by using the very simple form of the initial density matrix @xmath88 which is just a delta - function on some particular , specifically chosen initial values .",
    "we thus completely neglect the quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic fields .",
    "nevertheless , this approximation is still certainly wider than the chiral kinetic theory or hydrodynamical approximation .",
    "in this section we study the real - time evolution of the axial charge @xmath39 in the background of constant parallel external electric and magnetic fields . in the absence of backreaction",
    ", such setup provides a direct check of how well the anomaly equation ( [ volume_integrated_anomaly ] ) holds for the wilson - dirac hamiltonian with inexact chiral symmetry @xcite , which we further use to study the chiral plasma instability in section  [ sec : chiral_instability ] .",
    "the effect of backreaction is also interesting since the anomaly equation ( [ volume_integrated_anomaly ] ) is known to receive nontrivial corrections if the electromagnetic fields are dynamical @xcite .    in order to induce the constant external electric field",
    "@xmath98 , we switch on the external current of the form @xmath99 .",
    "constant external magnetic field is induced by the static circular external current flowing around the plaquettes with @xmath100 , @xmath101 for all @xmath102 , where @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 are lattice sizes .",
    "this static current is like a thin solenoid piercing a stack of lattice plaquettes , with the field strength being equal to @xmath106 outside of solenoid and @xmath107 inside it .",
    "lattice fermions , however , acquire only the aharonov - bohm phase @xmath108 when encircling such a solenoid if one imposes the flux quantization condition @xmath109 the total external current which we insert in the equations ( [ continuum_maxwell ] ) is the sum of the two currents which create constant electric and magnetic fields .    for the initial state of the fermionic fields , we use the eigenstates of the wilson - dirac hamiltonian @xmath110 }",

    "we consider only the limit of zero temperature , correspondingly , only the states with negative energies are initially occupied .",
    "the wilson - dirac hamiltonian which we use in our simulations does not have exact chiral symmetry , and there is no uniquely defined axial charge operator which would exactly satisfy the anomaly equation ( [ volume_integrated_anomaly ] ) and commute with the hamiltonian .",
    "rather , the anomaly equation ( [ volume_integrated_anomaly ] ) can only hold approximately , in the limit of large lattice volume and sufficiently smooth , slowly changing and small gauge fields @xcite .",
    "we thus use the simplest possible definitions of the operators of the axial charge density @xmath111 and the total axial charge @xmath39 : @xmath112 the time - dependent expectation value of the axial charge density is calculated similarly to the expectation value of electric current in ( [ fermionic_current_vev ] ) : @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the single - particle projector on a single lattice site @xmath46 : @xmath115 } _ { x_1 x_2 } = \\delta_{x_1 x } \\delta_{x x_2}$ ] .",

    "[ fig : effect_br ] ( green line ) .",
    "external electric field is switched off at the time @xmath135 .",
    "one can see that starting from this moment of time the axial charge exhibits only some small - scale fluctuations around the nonzero mean value .",

    "we now consider the situation in which the external electric and magnetic fields are switched on permanently .",

    "it is thus natural to expect that particle - anti - particle pairs produced by the external electric field will tend to screen this field , just as in the case of schwinger effect in @xmath140 dimensions . to check this conjecture , on the right panel of fig .",

    "after that the electric field exhibits some fluctuations around zero with the amplitude which is approximately five times smaller than the initial field value .",
    "we thus conclude that the effect of backreaction on the chirality pumping is to stop the growth of the axial charge by screening the external electric field down to zero .",
    "in this section , we consider a situation in which some initial chiral imbalance is already created e.g. by chirality pumping , and the parallel electric and magnetic fields are adiabatically switched off while keeping nonzero value of the total axial charge @xmath39 and hence the chiral chemical potential @xmath4 . in this setup",

    "this block - diagonal structure can be used to greatly reduce the number of independent components of @xmath357 which enter the equations ( [ modes_leapfrog ] ) .",
    "we have used translational invariance in two out of three spatial lattice directions to speed up the evolution algorithm on large lattices with sizes up to @xmath359 , assuming translational invariance in two out of three spatial directions .    for the evolution of electromagnetic field we use the equations which directly follow from ( [ csft_eqfin ] ) : @xmath360 in our simulations",
    ", we use the value @xmath361 .",
    "we have checked that decreasing @xmath327 down to @xmath362 does not change our results up to some small unimportant fluctuations .    in principle , leapfrog - type time discretization ( [ modes_leapfrog ] ) allows the existence of fermionic doublers in time direction - that is , the symmetric finite differences in ( [ modes_leapfrog ] ) are zero if the mode functions oscillate as @xmath363 .",
    "such doubler modes correspond to another flavour of dirac fermions with an opposite signature of the @xmath61 matrix .",

    "whether fermionic modes with such high frequencies are excited we have calculated the average norm of forward finite differences of @xmath357 as @xmath364 . since",
    "the size of the single - particle hilbert space is equal to @xmath365 this quantity should be of order of @xmath366 if @xmath357 are smooth functions of @xmath249 . on the other hand , doubler modes with @xmath367 yield the contribution of order of unity . in our simulations",
    "we have checked that the above norm remains of order of @xmath368 for all evolution times and does not exhibit any tendency to grow .",
    "this suggests that the doubler modes remain practically unexcited during the evolution .",
    "another important characteristic of the discretization of the evolution equations ( [ continuum_maxwell ] ) and ( [ single_particle_schrodinger ] ) is the precision with which the conservation of energy ( [ energy_conservation ] ) holds . for the leap - frog equations ( [ modes_leapfrog ] ) and",

    "[ fig : energy_joint ] we show the time dependence of the fermionic energy @xmath369 , the energy @xmath370 of electromagnetic fields and their total .",
    "one can see that while both @xmath369 and @xmath370 change quite strongly during the evolution , their sum is conserved with a very good precision , which again shows that the time step @xmath361 is small enough .    the discrete evolution equations ( [ modes_leapfrog ] ) and ( [ em_fields_leapfrog ] ) are ideally suited for parallelization on multi - node computers .",
    "indeed , the largest amount of computer time is required to solve the evolution equation ( [ modes_leapfrog ] ) for the @xmath371 matrix @xmath357 .",
    "taking into account that only half of the single - particle fermionic states are filled at zero temperature , this size can be reduced by a factor of two down to @xmath372 .",
    "the evolution of electromagnetic field ( [ em_fields_leapfrog ] ) requires only the total electric current summed over all fermionic modes , and is computationally very cheap .",
    "thus it is natural to distribute the rows of the @xmath357 matrix over multiple nodes . on each node",
    ", one performs the elementary evolution step ( [ modes_leapfrog ] ) for the rows attributed to this node and calculates the partial traces of the electric current and other fermionic bilinear operators over these rows .",
    "the results are sent to the master node , which calculates the total current and performs the evolution of the electromagnetic field according to ( [ em_fields_leapfrog ] ) .",
    "since the amount of data transferred by network from each slave node to the master node is significantly smaller than the amount of data stored at each slave mode ( for realistic lattice sizes and node numbers , the number of rows of @xmath357 per node is large ) , the speed of the algorithm scales practically linearly with the number of slave nodes .",
    "such parallelization also solves the problem with very large amount of ram memory required to store the matrix @xmath357 ( @xmath373 gb for the @xmath374 lattice when one uses 8-byte double accuracy numbers for all fields ) , which is simply split over different nodes . in order to further decrease the required ram size ,",
    "we use the 4-byte float numbers to store @xmath357 .",
    "we have explicitly checked that the reduction from double to float real numbers practically does not affect our results .",
    "the extensive parallelization also allows us to avoid the stochastic summation over all modes @xcite , which introduces additional statistical noise in the results and can therefore significantly affect potentially unstable evolution which we study in this work .",
    "instead , we perform exact summation over all initially occupied fermionic states ."
