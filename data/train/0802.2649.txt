    "theoretical approaches based on covariant density functional theory ( cdft ) remain undoubtedly among the most successful microscopic descriptions of nuclear structure .",
    "the cdft approaches are derived from a lorentz invariant density functional which connects in a consistent way the spin and spatial degrees of freedom in the nucleus .",
    "therefore , it needs only a relatively small number of parameters which are adjusted to reproduce a set of bulk properties of spherical closed - shell nuclei  @xcite and it is valid over the entire periodic table . over the years , relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) models based on the cdft have been successfully applied to describe ground state properties of finite spherical and deformed nuclei over the entire nuclear chart  @xcite from light nuclei  @xcite to super - heavy elements  @xcite , from the neutron drip line where halo phenomena are observed  @xcite , to the proton drip line  @xcite with nuclei unstable against the emission of protons  @xcite .",
    "the relativistic cranking approximation has been developed to calculate rotational bands  @xcite . for a description of nuclear excited states , the relativistic random phase approximation ( rrpa )  @xcite and the quasiparticle rrpa ( rqrpa )",
    "@xcite have been formulated as the small amplitude limit of the time - dependent rmf models .",
    "these models have provided a very good description for the positions of giant resonances and a theoretical interpretation of the low - lying dipole  @xcite and quadrupole  @xcite excitations .",
    "proton - neutron versions of the rrpa and the rqrpa have been developed and successfully applied to the description of spin / isospin excitations as the isobaric analog resonance ( iar ) or the gamow - teller resonance ( gtr )  @xcite .",
    "recently , several attempts have been made to extend the rmf and rrpa formalism beyond the mean field approach , first of all , to solve the well known problem of the rmf single - particle level density in the vicinity of the fermi surface which is too low because of the too small effective mass .",
    "the energy dependence of the single - nucleon self - energy was emulated in a phenomenological way  @xcite and microscopically by coupling the single particle configurations to low - lying surface vibration  @xcite .",
    "this provided a considerable improvement for the description of the single - particle spectra .",
    "an addition , the quadrupole motion has been studied within the relativistic generator coordinate method ( gcm )  @xcite .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , we have extended the relativistic rpa by introducing a coupling to collective vibrations using the techniques developed and realized long ago for non - relativistic approaches in terms of the green s function formalism  @xcite .",
    "an induced additional interaction between single - particle and vibrational excitations provided a strong fragmentation of the pure rrpa states causing the spreading width of giant resonances and the redistribution of the pygmy strength to lower energies .",
    "this method does not include pairing correlations and therefore it is restricted essentially to the few nuclei with doubly closed shells in the nuclear chart .    in the present work we consider systems with pairing correlations .",
    "again , we are guided by ideas of the quasiparticle time - blocking approximation ( qtba ) developed and applied for non - relativistic systems in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , which takes into account quasiparticle - phonon coupling ( qpc ) and pairing correlations on an equal footing .",
    "however , our approach is based on cdft and formulated in terms of relativistic green s functions of the dirac - hartree - bogoliubov ( dhb ) or the dirac - hartree - bcs ( dhbcs ) equations . similar , but in details different , approaches developed earlier within a non - relativistic formalism can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the main assumption of the quasiparticle - phonon coupling model  @xcite is that the two types of elementary excitations  two - quasiparticle and vibrational modes  are coupled in such a way that configurations of @xmath6 type with low - lying phonons strongly compete with simple @xmath7 configurations close in energy or , in other words , that quasiparticles can emit and absorb phonons with rather high probabilities .",
    "obviously , these processes should affect both the ground and excited states and therefore , the corresponding amplitudes should be taken into account both in the single - nucleon self - energy and in the effective interaction in the nuclear interior .    in order to describe excited states in nuclei , we extend covariant density functional theory by coupling the quasiparticles to low - lying vibrations in a consistent way using effective interactions derived from the same lagrangian without additional phenomenological parameters .",
    "first of all , we use the well - known quasiparticle formalism , where , in terms of second quantization , nucleon creation and annihilation operators become components of a two - component operator mixing a creation and annihilation of a particle into a single quasiparticle .",
    "this leads to the fact , that for systems with pairing correlations all quantum operators become tensors in the two - dimensional quasiparticle space .",
    "in particular , the relativistic energy functional is expressed in terms of the relativistic extension of the valatin density matrix @xcite of double dimension containing the normal as well as the abnormal densities . as discussed in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite pairing correlations can be considered in a very good approximation as a non - relativistic effect and therefore the full density functional is a sum of the relativistic energy functional depending on the normal density and derived from the underlying lagrangian and a non - relativistic pairing energy @xmath8 , depending on the abnormal density .",
    "the equations of motion are the self - consistent relativistic hartree bogoliubov ( rhb ) equations .",
    "they are derived from this general functional by variation with respect to the valatin density matrix .",
    "they are solved numerically and the self - consistent fields obtained in this way , which do not depend on the energy , form the static part of the nucleon self - energy .",
    "this static part determines the nuclear ground state in the mean field approximation .",
    "the static effective interaction used in conventional qrpa approximation is derived as the second derivative of the same energy functional and therefore it contains no additional parameters .",
    "it enables us to go a step further and to compute amplitudes , or vertices , which describe the emission or absorption of phonons by quasiparticles within the relativistic framework .",
    "these amplitudes form the essential ingredient for the following considerations .",
    "they determine an additive energy - dependent and non - local term in the self - energy of the single - quasiparticle equation of motion and , consequently , an induced effective interaction between the quasiparticles .",
    "both of these quantities have an influence on the @xmath9- as well as on the @xmath10-channel .",
    "for the calculation of the response of a nucleus in an external field we use the bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "it contains both the static and the induced effective interactions and it is formulated in the doubled two - quasiparticle basis of the dirac - hartree - bogoliubov eigenstates .",
    "this bethe - salpether equation describes the quasiparticle - phonon coupling and pairing correlations on the equal footing .",
    "it is solved using the quasiparticle time blocking approximation ( qtba ) developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which allows the truncation to @xmath6 configurations and guarantees that the solution is positive defined .",
    "we also use the subtraction procedure introduced and justified in the ref .  @xcite . as in the case without pairing it avoids double counting of the qpc . at zero energy ,",
    "i.e. at the ground state , particle vibrational coupling should have no influence , because the correlations induced by qpc in the ground state have already been taken into account in the rhb description through the parameters of the energy functional initially fitted to reproduce experimental data , such as nuclear binding energies and radii .",
    "therefore , the relativistic mean field contains effectively all the correlations in the static approximation . the energy dependence of the self energy influences only excitations at finite energy in the nucleus .    in the present work we develop the relativistic quasiparticle time blocking approximation ( rqtba ) and apply it for the description of electric dipole excitations in even - even spherical open - shell nuclei , such as the tin ( @xmath0 ) isotopes @xmath11sn and the ( @xmath2 ) isotones @xmath3sr , @xmath4zr , @xmath5mo .",
    "the rqtba method , whose physical content is an extension of the rqrpa by a coupling to low - lying collective vibrations , provides spectra enriched with the @xmath6 states .",
    "they cause a strong redistribution of the rqrpa strength . as a result",
    ", we obtain an additional broadening of the giant dipole resonance and a spreading of the soft dipole mode ( pygmy resonance ) to lower energies in the nuclei under investigation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ form ]",
    "we formulate basic relations of our approach in a rather general form .",
    "in section [ appl ] we give a more detailed formalism for spherical nuclei in the form adopted for numerical calculations .",
    "section [ details ] is devoted to the description of some numerical details and to the presentation of our results for even - even semi - magic nuclei .",
    "finally , section [ outlook ] contains conclusions and an outlook .",
    "in this subsection we recall the general formalism of covariant density functional theory with pairing , introduce notations and determine conventions used later on .    in open - shell nuclei ,",
    "pairing correlations play an essential role and have to be incorporated consistently in a description of the ground state as well as of excited states including many - body dynamics . considering @xmath10-correlations in addition to the usual @xmath9-interaction , existing in normal systems",
    ", one has to provide a unified description of both @xmath10- and @xmath9-channels .",
    "in contrast to hartree- or hartree - fock theory , where @xmath10-correlations are neglected , and where the building blocks of excitations ( the quasiparticles in the sense of landau ) are either nucleons in levels above the fermi surface ( particles ) or missing nucleons in levels below the fermi surface ( holes ) , we have now quasiparticles in the sense of bogoliubov which are described by a combination of creation and annihilation operators .",

    "6@xmath316 have been calculated with the same restrictions and selected using the same criterion as in the ref .",
    "@xcite and in many other non - relativistic investigations in this context .",
    "only the phonons with energies below the neutron separation energy for the examined tin isotopes and below 10 mev  for the @xmath2 nuclei enter the phonon space since the contributions of the higher - lying modes are supposed to be small . our previous experience within the non - relativistic approach of ref .",
    "@xcite without the restriction of the phonon space by the energy have shown that the inclusion of the high - lying modes into the phonon space cause the change of the mean energies and widths of the resonances comparable with the smearing parameter ( imaginary part of the energy variable ) used in the calculations , because the physical sense of this parameter is to emulate contributions of remaining configurations which are not taken into account explicitly .    as a test of numerical correctness of our codes , the response equation has been solved both in the dhbcs basis and in momentum - channel space and identical results have been obtained . since the quasiparticle - phonon coupling amplitude ( [ phiphc ] ) has a pole structure , its contributions to the final result for the strength function decrease considerably when we go away from the fermi surface . therefore , this coupling has been taken into account only within the @xmath7-energy window @xmath318 25 mev around the fermi surface .",
    "this restriction means that above this energy we have no poles induced by the complex configurations , and obtain the pure rqrpa poles , but with larger strength which comes from the integral contribution of the lower - lying energy spectrum .",
    "it has been checked that a further increase of this window does not influence considerably the strength functions at energies below the value of this window .",
    "although a large number of configurations of the @xmath6 type are taken into account explicitly in our approach , nevertheless we stay in the same two - quasiparticle space as in the rqrpa , therefore the problem of completeness of the phonon basis does not arise and , therefore , the phonon subspace and the subspace of the @xmath6 states can be truncated in the above mentioned way .",
    "another essential point is , that on all three stages of our calculations the same relativistic nucleon - nucleon static interaction @xmath140 has been employed .",
    "the vertices ( [ gammaj ] ) entering the qpc energy - dependent interaction are calculated with the same force . therefore no further parameters are needed , and our calculation scheme is fully consistent .    the subtraction procedure developed in the ref .",
    "@xcite for self - consistent schemes has been incorporated in our approach . as it was mentioned above",
    ", this procedure removes the static contribution of the quasiparticle - phonon coupling from the static interaction in the @xmath9-channel .",
    "therefore , the qpc interaction takes into account only the additional energy dependence introduced by the dynamics of the system .",
    "it has been found in the present calculations as well as in the calculations of the ref .",
    "@xcite that within the relatively large energy interval ( 0 - 30 mev ) the subtraction procedure provides a rather small increase of the mean energy of the giant dipole resonance ( about 0.7 mev for tin region ) and gives rise to the change by a few percents in the sum rule .",
    "this procedure restores the response at zero energy and , therefore , it does not disturb the symmetry properties of the rqrpa calculations .",
    "the zero energy modes connected with the spontaneous symmetry breaking in the mean field solutions , as , for instance , the translational mode in the dipole case , remain at exactly the same positions after the inclusion of the quasiparticle - vibration coupling . in practice , however , because of the limited number of oscillator shells in our calculations this state is found already in the rqrpa without the qpc at a few hundreds kev above zero . in cases , where the results depend strongly on a proper separation of this spurious state , as , for instance , for investigations of the pygmy dipole resonance in neutron rich systems , we have to include a large number of the @xmath7-configurations in the rqrpa solution to avoid mixing of the spurious state with the low - lying physical states .      in figs .

    "calculations within the rqrpa are shown by the dashed curves , and the rqtba - by the solid curves .",
    "experimental data are taken from the exfor database @xcite .",
    "these three figures clearly demonstrate how the two - quasiparticle states , which are responsible for the spectrum of the rqrpa excitations , are fragmented through the coupling to the collective vibrational states .",
    "the effect of the particle - vibration coupling on the low - lying dipole strength below and around the neutron threshold within the presented approach is shown in the left panels of the figs .",
    "[ f1]-[f3 ] .",
    "our calculations for the tin chain give us an example how the low - lying strength develops with the increase of the neutron excess .",
    "in the doubly - magic @xmath319sn two first relatively weak rrpa peaks appear between 9 and 10 mev .",
    "quasiparticle - phonon coupling redistributes these structures and shifts them about one mev lower . in the @xmath320sn due to the pairing correlations in the neutron system the whole rqrpa picture is shifted towards higher energies , and there is practically no strength below 10 mev . in the corresponding figure we find only the strength caused by the fragmentation of the higher - lying rqrpa peaks above 11 mev . in the @xmath321sn",
    "the neutron excess becomes enough to form the pronounced pygmy mode situated in the rqrpa at about 9.2 mev and spread over many states of the @xmath6 nature beginning from 5 mev .",
    "[ f2 ] shows how this tendency develops in the more neutron - rich nuclei : more strength is split to this region and this strength goes to lower energies .",
    "the lorentz fit parameters for the calculated gdr in the energy intervals : ( 10 - 22.5 ) mev for the tin chain and ( 10 - 25 ) mev for the @xmath2 chain are displayed in table  [ tab1 ] and they are compared with the corresponding data of refs .  @xcite . in our work",
    "the lorentz fit is performed in such a way that the obtained lorentzian has the same momenta of -2,-1 and zero orders as our microscopical strength function .",
    "this method works well if the model strength function is rather close to the lorentz shape . from the table  [ tab1 ]",
    "we notice that the inclusion of the particle - phonon coupling in the rqtba calculation induces a pronounced fragmentation of the photo absorption cross sections , and brings the mean energies and widths of the gdr in much better agreement with the data , for all the examined nuclei .",
    "the contribution of the low - lying strength below 10 mev to the dipole spectrum is quantified in table  [ tab2 ] . for the each nucleus",
    ", we have calculated the following quantities : the non - energy weighted sum @xmath327 , which is obtained by direct integration of the strength , and the energy - weighted quantity @xmath328 , which is an integral of the cross section expressed in the percentage of the classical thomas - reiche - kuhn sum rule .",
    "both quantities have been calculated with rqrpa and rqtba to emphasize the effect of the quasiparticle - phonon coupling for the two energy intervals : ( 0 - 10 ) mev and ( 0 - 8 ) mev .",
    "the choice of the intervals is determined by the fact that , from one hand , in our approach we associate the pygmy modes with the dipole strength which originates from the first pronounced rqrpa peaks of the isoscalar nature , and these peaks are situated in the tin isotopes just below 10 mev . from the other hand , the measurements of the low - lying strength excited in these nuclei in the real - photon scattering experiments @xcite are restricted by the energy around 8 mev because at higher energies the sensitivity of these experiments decreases considerably . therefore , we have included the strength , calculated in the both energy intervals , into the table [ tab2 ] .",
    "the integral contribution of the low - energy portions calculated within the rqtba agrees very well with the available data that can be seen from table [ tab2 ] : the inclusion of the coupling to phonons noticeably improves the description .",
    "moreover , below 8 mev in the most of the examined nuclei we observe that the quasiparticle - phonon coupling is the only mechanism which brings the strength to this region where the pure rqrpa has no solutions at all .",
    "we have found also general agreement of our results for @xmath329sn and @xmath3sr with the relatively recent studies of the low - lying dipole strength in refs .",
    "@xcite in the quasiparticle phonon model ( qpm ) @xcite , although our analysis of transition densities leads to somewhat different conclusions ( this analysis will be considered in a special publication ) .",

    "works a clear dependence of the pdr strength and centroid energies on the neutron - skin thickness was demonstrated .",
    "although the integral strength is described rather good within our approach , the level densities of the obtained low - lying spectra seem to be underestimated as compared to the experimental works . in the other words , in our approach",
    "the effect of fragmentation of the rqrpa excitations due to coupling to phonons is not enough . to obtain a more realistic effect",
