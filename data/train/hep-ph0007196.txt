    "the starting point for the study of nonleptonic weak transitions is the analysis of short - distance effects using perturbative qcd .",
    "the results are expressed using the operator product expansion ( ope ) as a series of local operators . in practice ,",
    "only operators of dimension six are considered .",
    "we will argue that operators of dimension eight are also relevant , and that most previous analyses of nonleptonic amplitudes must be reconsidered .",
    "nonleptonic weak amplitudes represent probably the most difficult calculations in qcd .",
    "since the w - boson propagator is a constant up to @xmath9 in momentum space , the amplitude is sensitive to strong interaction physics at _ all _ energy scales .",
    "therefore , one must control simultaneously the very low , intermediate and high energy portions of the calculation .",
    "there are two key ideas , both introduced by wilson@xcite , that are used in this regard .",
    "one consists of separating the different energy scales and integrating out those effects from high energy .",
    "this yields an effective low energy theory with modified interactions .",
    "the second is the tool for doing this - the operator product expansion ( ope ) - in which the effects of high energy are replaced by local operators ordered according to increasing dimension .",
    "the latter can be applied at any scale , and as we reduce this scale we successively integrate out more and more physics , thereby changing the coefficients of the operators . specifically , one can consider the physics above and below some energy scale @xmath4 . throughout the paper , we will refer to @xmath4 as the _ separation scale_. for example , if one takes the complete set of all local dimension-@xmath10 operators . ]",
    "@xmath11 with the right quantum numbers , the operator product expansion tells us that a @xmath12 amplitude can be written to leading order in dimension as _",
    "w^(s = 1 )  =  g_f   v_usv_ud^ * _ d _ i  c_i^(d ) ( )   _ i^(d ) _  .",
    "[ dim1 ] here the @xmath13 are coefficients which describe the short distance physics with @xmath14 .",
    "the subscript ` @xmath4 ' on the operator matrix element indicates that the matrix element is to include all physics up to the energy scale @xmath4 ( _ i.e. _ with @xmath15 ) .",
    "the short distance ope does not by itself solve the problem of nonleptonic amplitudes .",
    "however , it does tell us that the remaining task is to calculate the low energy matrix elements of local operators .",
    "an example of this appears in fig .",
    "[ fig : dim8fig1 ] , where the long - distance ( low - energy ) and short - distance ( high - energy ) parts of a nonleptonic weak transition are depicted separately .",
    "let the separation scale be @xmath4 .",
    "then the gluons shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dim8fig1](a ) have @xmath15 and are associated with long - distance propagation .",
    "the blackened disc denotes all the ( short - distance ) effects with @xmath14 .",
    "we next look into the short - distance regime via fig .",
    "[ fig : dim8fig1](b ) .",
    "now there are only hard gluons with @xmath14 which propagate over short - distances .",
    "if the separation scale @xmath4 is large enough , the physics at the higher energies can be analyzed with perturbative qcd .",
    "because of this , the short - distance effects will appear local when viewed by low energy probes . also , observe in fig .",
    "[ fig : dim8fig1](b ) that the w - boson mass has been taken to infinity and so the process shown there corresponds to the range @xmath16 .",
    "the most obvious candidates for the basis of weak nonleptonic operators are those with dimension six , formed as the product of two currents , _ 1 q_2   |q_3 q_4  . [ dim2 ] since the hamiltonian is the product of two weak currents , the coefficients of these operators are dimensionless .",

    "the coefficients of these operators have engineering dimension ( energy)@xmath19 . in the original papers@xcite on the weak interaction ope it was stated explicitly that the coefficients of dimension - eight operators are of order @xmath2 , and this has been accepted ever since .",

    "matrix element evaluations in dimensional regularization must be sensitive to energies _ above _ the scale @xmath4 .",
    "2 .   in this case",

    "3 .   mixed evaluations ,",
    "in which one calculates the coefficients using dimensional regularization and the matrix elements using a form of a cutoff , are inherently inconsistent .",

    "however , the key new feature here is that the matrix elements of the dimension - eight operators must be added directly to that of dimension six in order to form the @xmath105 matrix element .",
    "other @xmath105 operators will also have similar relations involving dimension - eight effects when converting from cutoff schemes .",
    "we discuss this point in the appendix .",
    "we have uncovered a basic problem with existing calculations of weak amplitudes .",
    "the coefficients in the ope are calculated using dimensional regularization and hence do not include dimension - eight operators . however , all matrix elements are calculated with some variation of a cutoff and hence also do not contain the effects of dimension - eight operators . when one connects the matrix elements to those in the @xmath79 scheme , one needs to consider _ both _ dimension - six and dimension - eight operators as our example shows in eq .",
    "( [ va37 ] ) .",
    "however in practice this is not done , and the result is then inconsistent .",
    "lattice evaluations of operators@xcite rely on the finite lattice spacing to remove all short distance physics .",
    "this is a true cutoff , as the effects of short distance physics is simply not present in the simulation .",
    "most current lattice calculations identify the inverse lattice spacing with the scale @xmath4 that defines the matrix element , although there are alternative possibilities ( see item 1 below for an example ) .",
    "therefore , to convert from lattice regularization at any fixed lattice spacing to a dimensional scheme requires the addition of both dimension - six and dimension - eight operators .",
    "this can be done as part of the ` improvement ' procedure@xcite which attempts to correct for the effects of lattice artifacts , including the effects of finite lattice spacing . on the lattice",
    "the effects of higher dimension operators can be more severe , as the lack of chiral invariance can generate a dimension seven operator@xcite , whose effect also needs to be corrected for .",
    "the present state of the art does not yet include the effects of dimension eight operators , but in the future it should be possible to correct also also for these .    quark model ( and also large n@xmath108 ) matrix elements are in a far more difficult situation@xcite . in these cases ,",
    "low energy models are postulated , and the models only make sense below 1  gev or so .",
    "these models are treated with a cutoff of order 1  gev , and can not contain the required short - distance physics . while lattice methods are correctible to account for dimension - eight effects , the same appears doubtful in quark model methods .",
    "we then must conclude that there are very large intrinsic uncertainties associated with these methods .",
    "there are several strategies for overcoming the basic inconsistency we have revealed :    1 .   in principle , the best way is avoid the need for a cutoff in the matrix element calculation - to have a method which is sensitive to all scales .",
    "this can then directly yield @xmath105 matrix elements .",
    "one possible procedure is the lattice analysis of the kaon @xmath109-parameter in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the scale @xmath71 is held fixed while the lattice spacing is varied .",
    "the various values of the lattice spacing are then used to perform an extrapolation to the continuoum limit , at fixed @xmath71 .",
    "although this was done to remove lattice artifacts , it also has the effect of removing the need for dimension - eight effects ( since the separation scale in the matrix element is sent to infinity ) .",
    "a second procedure is the evaluation that we provided in the first half of this paper , based on sum rule techniques where one knows the vacuum polarization functions at all scales  @xcite . in this method",
    "there is no obstacle to a full evaluation , because we can take the separation scale to infinity .",
    "see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a calculation sensitive to all distance scales . in general",
    ", the lattice seems most suited for a systematic program of extrapolating matrix elements to very large separation scales .",
    "we caution , however , that this has not yet been done in all cases of interest .",
    "2 .   a less ambitious but still valuable strategy would be to work at values of separation scale @xmath4 large enough that the problems of higher dimensions are numerically insignificant . stated in a different way , at large enough @xmath4 the matrix element evaluation",
    "will already contain all the needed ingredients , and residual dimension - eight effects that are missing will be small enough .",
    "this option is likely only available for lattice regularization , where it is tied to the ability to decrease the lattice spacing .",
    "quark model methods make sense only at low energy and can not be extended to larger @xmath4 .",
    "the question in this case is how large @xmath4 must be for a result of a given accuracy .",
    "we have addressed this for our model hamiltionian above with the result that @xmath110  gev appears to be required . if the lattice is used to give estimates of matrix element of the dimension eight operators calculated in sect .",
    "iii , these results could be used to provide a second estimate of the relative importance of these terms .",
    "an advantage of this method is that one does not need to be highly accurate or highly consistent .",
    "if the dimension - eight effects are small at a given @xmath4 , then we do not need to match them to the rest of the calculation .",
    "we instead use the estimated size to produce an error bar due to this effect .",
    "if the error bar is small enough , we need need not consider dimension - eight operators further .",
    "3 .   alternatively",
    ", one might adopt a cut - off scheme for both the matrix elements and the ope coefficients .",
    "this would bring dimension - eight operators into the ope , and their matrix elements would also need to be computed .",
    "however , this option appears difficult to carry out to the accuracy that we desire . at one loop ,",
    "a cut - off scheme is only moderately difficult .",
    "one needs to be careful to preserve gauge invariance and other symmetres .",
    "one also needs to find a scheme that is equally useful for the perturbative calculation of the coefficients and for the calculation of the matrix elements if one is going to match them consistently .",
    "this latter requirement is likely difficult .",
    "however , it will be extremely difficult to implement a cut - off scheme at two loops .",
    "the presence of a dimensionful parameter upsets the normal power counting , and requires great care in properly defining the operators beyond one loop .",
    "in addition , the separation of nested loops in a cutoff scheme is subtle and can potentially lead to troubles with gauge invariance and other symmetries .",
    "4 .   yet another option would be to continue to follow the most standard practice ( of using dimensional regularization for the wilson coefficients and a cutoff procedure for the operator matrix elements ) , but to correct the matrix elements to include the short distance effects from dimension - eight operators . in this case one",
    "would calculate both dimension - six and dimension - eight operators in some cutoff scheme , then add the contributions together with the right coefficient to form the dimensionally regularized matrix element .",
    "this is what is done earlier in eq .",
    "( [ va37 ] ) .",
    "this allows one to use the extensive work that has been performed calculating the ope coefficients .",
    "it remians to be seen if this procedure can be successfully carried out in all cases of interest .",
    "much of the existing work in the field is done at low values of @xmath4 .",
    "various quark model and large - n@xmath108 methods use @xmath111  gev , at which scales these effects are apparently extremely important .",
    "these calculations must be considered to contain enormous uncertanties , at least until further work is done .",
    "lattice calculations are typically carried out with @xmath112  gev , although there is recent progress at working at higher @xmath4 . at this scale ,",
    "dimension - eight contributions appear to still be larger than other effects which are included , such as scheme dependence and two - loop evaluation of the coefficient functions .",
