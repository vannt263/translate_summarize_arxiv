    "the fact that compact conformations of polymers are principal configurations of the native states of globular proteins makes them an important subset of all the physically accessible conformations .",
    "since compact conformations occupy space as densely as possible , one of the simplest ways to model them is to use hamiltonian walks ( hws ) on a lattice , which are , by definition , self - avoiding walks ( saws ) that visit all the lattice sites exactly once @xcite . in order to make this model more capable for capturing different features of various physical phenomena ( such as protein melting @xcite or protein folding @xcite ) local interactions",
    "can be introduced , but even in its simplest form , with no interactions taken into account , the problem of enumeration and classification of hamiltonian walks proved to be extremely difficult .",
    "studies of hamiltonian walks are primarily focused on finding the overall numbers @xmath2 of open and closed hws on lattice with @xmath3 sites . it is expected that limiting value of @xmath14 exists when @xmath15 , and its particular value @xmath16 corresponds to the configurational entropy per monomer ( site ) .",
    "this means that to the lowest approximation , @xmath2 behaves as @xmath6 and , therefore , the so - called connectivity constant @xmath7 can be interpreted as average number of steps available to the walker having already completed a large number of steps .",
    "the leading corrections to the exponential term are expected to have the power - law form @xmath17 ( as in the case of ordinary self - avoiding walks ) , and the stretched exponential form @xmath9 , with @xmath10 , so that @xmath2 should scale as @xmath18 expectations of such forms are based on the exact studies of hws on the manhattan @xcite and some fractal lattices @xcite , as well as on results obtained for closely related models of collapsed interacting self - avoiding walks on square @xcite and cubic lattice @xcite . in the case of collapsed saws appearance of the stretched exponential term , which is not present in the scaling form for non - interacting saws , was explained as a consequence of surface effects .",
    "namely , a collapsed saw forms a compact globule , with a sharp boundary separating it from the surrounding solvent , so that monomers on the boundary have smaller number of contacts with other monomers than those in the bulk of the globule , and therefore surface tension should arise .",
    "for homogeneous lattices one can assume that the boundary itself is homogeneous surface , and then straightforward arguments @xcite lead to the conclusion that term @xmath9 , with @xmath19 ( @xmath20 being the dimensionality of the lattice ) , should appear .",
    "exact studies @xcite , series analysis of data obtained via exact enumeration @xcite , as well as monte - carlo simulations @xcite of collapsed saws on homogeneous lattices , certainly confirm existence of the stretched exponential term with the proposed formula for @xmath11 .",
    "although it is believed that hw model corresponds to the interacting saw model at temperature @xmath21 , in spite of the continuous improvements of exact @xcite and monte carlo @xcite enumeration techniques , direct confirmation of scaling relation for hws on non - oriented homogeneous lattices has not been achieved yet .",
    "apart from manhattan lattice , scaling forms for hamiltonian walks were obtained only for some fractal lattices , where stretched exponential corrections for both open and closed hws were found only for @xmath22-simplex fractals with even @xmath22 @xcite . even in that cases ,",
    "its presence can not be explained using a simple generalization of the argument used for collapsed self - avoiding walks on homogeneous lattices .",
    "however , results of the studies on fractals suggest that stretched exponential term can be expected on lattices where larger number of entangled conformations is possible . in order to get a deeper insight into this issue ,",
    "here we apply an exact recursive method for enumeration and classification of hws on modified three - dimensional sierpinski gasket family of fractals .",
    "in contrast to most of the previously in this context studied fractals , which were embedded either in two - dimensional spaces or spaces with dimensionality higher than 3 , each member of the family studied in the present paper is embedded in three - dimensional space .",
    "therefore , hws on these fractals can be understood as a toy model for compact polymers critical behaviour in realistic nonhomogeneous 3d media , which , to the best of our knowledge , has not been studied so far .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "modified 3d sierpinski gasket fractals , as well as the method itself , are described in the next section .",
    "explicit forms of the recursion relations , obtained for the types of hamiltonian walks which are needed for generation and enumeration of all closed conformations are presented for the first three members of the fractal family . numerically analyzing these relations we find scaling form @xmath23 .",
    "using some general features of these relations ( obtained in [ ap : kb ] and [ app : xasimptotika ] ) , we argue that such form should be correct for the whole fractal family , and derive the closed - form formula for the exponent @xmath11 . in section 3",
    "we extend the method to open hws , explicitly apply it again on the first three fractals , and then generalize it .",
    "it turns out that the number of open hws scales as @xmath24 , with the same values of the connectivity constant @xmath25 and the exponent @xmath11 as for the closed hws , but with @xmath26 .",
    "general features of the recursion relations for open hws are derived in [ app : ac ] and [ app : dh ] .",
    "all the obtained results are summarized and discussed in the section 4 , and some auxiliary considerations , needed for the discussion , are given in appendix e.",
    "three - dimensional modified sierpinski gasket ( 3d msg ) fractal is constructed recursively , starting with a unit tetrahedron .",
    "the first step of the construction , so called generator @xmath27 of order @xmath28 , is obtained by joining @xmath29 unit tetrahedrons into a @xmath8 times larger tetrahedral structure ( see ) in such a way that vertices of neighboring unit tetrahedrons are connected via infinitesimal junctions .    .",
    "vertices of neighboring unit tetrahedrons are connected via infinitesimal junctions . ]    enlarging the generator @xmath8 times , and substituting the smallest tetrahedrons with @xmath27 , and then repeating this procedure @xmath30 times , one obtains @xmath31 - generator of order @xmath32 , which contains @xmath33 sites .",
    "the complete 3d msg fractal with parameter @xmath8 is obtained when @xmath34 , and its fractal dimension @xmath35 is equal to @xmath36/{\\ln b}\\ , .\\ ] ] one should note here that ordinary 3d sierpinski gasket ( sg ) fractal with parameter @xmath8 is constructed in a similar way , with the only difference being that neighboring unit tetrahedrons in 3d sg lattice are not moved apart , as is the case for the 3d msg fractal . this small change does not alter the basic properties of the lattice , such as its fractal dimension , but it simplifies the complicated scheme needed for enumeration of closed hamiltonian walks on 3d sg fractals @xcite and allows for enumeration of extremely long open hws on 3d msg fractals with @xmath1 , and 4 .",
    "in addition , general conclusions about scaling forms of the numbers of hws on 3d msg fractal with arbitrary @xmath13 can be derived , as will be explained in what follows .    by definition ,",
    "each hamiltonian walk on @xmath37 structure visits all its @xmath38 sites exactly once . in     msg fractal .",
    "the generator consists of 40 vertices , which are numbered consecutively from the first ( arbitrarily chosen ) vertex visited by the hw , to the last one ( which is connected with the first one ) .",
    "one can notice that hw conformation within the unit tetrahedron can be either one - stranded ( @xmath39-type ) , like the one connecting the sites 26 - 27 - 28 - 29 , or two - stranded ( @xmath40-type ) , like the conformation traversing the tetrahedron with vertices 4 - 5 - 12 - 13 . ]",
    "an example of closed hamiltonian walk on the generator @xmath41 is shown .",
    "one can notice that this hw can be decomposed into @xmath42 parts ( within the ten unit tetrahedrons ) , which are either one- or two - stranded .",
    "this observation can easily be generalized to generators of higher order and any @xmath8 : any closed hw on @xmath31 can be decomposed into @xmath43 parts within the same number of generators @xmath37 , from which the generator @xmath31 is made of .",
    "these parts traverse each @xmath44 either once or two times , and we shall call the corresponding configurations @xmath39- or @xmath40-type hw steps , respectively , whereas numbers of hws of these types within a @xmath44 will be denoted by @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively . using these numbers ,",
    "the overall number of closed hws on @xmath31 can be expressed as @xmath47 where @xmath48 are the numbers of closed hws configurations within @xmath31 , with @xmath49 steps of @xmath40type , and @xmath50 @xmath39steps .",
    "for instance , the path presented in is one of @xmath51 possible closed hws within the @xmath41 , contributing to the term @xmath52 in the corresponding equation .",
    "the upper limit @xmath53 in the sum in is equal to 0 for @xmath54 , whereas for @xmath13 it can be shown ( see [ ap : kb ] ) that @xmath55 due to the self - similarity of the lattices under study , the numbers @xmath48 do not depend on @xmath30 , and , also , numbers @xmath45 and @xmath46 fulfil recursion relations of the following form : @xmath56 where coefficients @xmath57 and @xmath58 depend only on @xmath49 and @xmath8 , and are positive integers for all @xmath13 , including zero for @xmath54 . for instance , for @xmath54 these relations are recursion relations are the same as for the 4-simplex fractal lattice @xcite . ]",

    "one should notice here that the fact that scaling form obtained for open hws is determined by the behavior of the numbers @xmath45 and @xmath46 only , means that contribution of one and two  leg hw conformations ( @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109type walks ) , _ i.e. _ hws with their ends in the interior of @xmath37 fractal structures , is not significant .",
    "furthermore , in sections 2 and 3 it was elaborated that the main mathematical reason for obtaining scaling forms with the stretched exponential correction term is the fact that @xmath191 , meaning that entangled conformations ( with large number of two - stranded parts ) dominate over those in which hws rarely return to already visited fractal generators .",
    "results of the study of hws on 3d msg fractals , presented in this paper , should be compared with the results recently obtained for other fractal lattices @xcite . for @xmath22-simplex fractal lattices with even values of @xmath22 the same asymptotic behavior of the hw numbers",
    "was found , @xmath192 , but with @xmath193 , which differs from the formula derived here for @xmath11 .",
    "the existence of the term @xmath9 was also related with the facts that : ( 1 ) entangled hws prevail , and ( 2 ) hws with `` interior '' terminating points do not contribute to the asymptotic behavior of hw numbers , as in the 3d msg fractals case . for odd @xmath22 , stretched exponential terms in the scaling forms for hws on @xmath22-simplex fractals do not exist , hws with `` interior '' terminating points do affect the scaling forms for the numbers of open hws , and entangled conformations do not dominate in this case . for given - mandelbrot and 2d",
    "modified sierpinski gasket fractals ( which are two - dimensional generalizations of the sierpinski gasket and 3-simplex fractal , respectively ) stretched exponential terms are also absent , whereas again , one and two  leg conformations are necessary for obtaining the scaling forms for open hws , and , due to the specific topology of these lattices , only one - stranded hw conformations are possible .",
    "therefore , results of the present study confirm the assumption that existence of the stretched exponential term is related with the issue of hw entanglement",
    ". however , the discrepancy between the formulas obtained for the exponent @xmath11 for different fractal families , and , more generally , the question which properties of the underlying lattice and in what way determine @xmath11 , deserves further consideration . to this end",
    "we recall that stretched exponential terms were obtained for hws on manhattan @xcite , as well as for low - temperature saws on square @xcite and cubic @xcite lattice . in this context",
    ", one should also mention the spiral saws on 2d regular lattices @xcite and lattice animals on some hierarchical lattices . whereas , to the best of our knowledge , physical interpretation of the stretched exponential term for the 2d spiral saw models has never been proposed , its presence in the scaling forms obtained for lattice animals on hierarchical lattices was directly connected with the existence of the sets of sites with different coordination numbers @xcite .",
    "utilizing similar idea , in the case of low - temperature ( collapsed ) saws it was explicitly explained in @xcite why term of the form @xmath9 , with @xmath19 for regular lattices , should arise .",
    "however , as was elaborated in @xcite , direct application of such approach on hws on fractal lattices does not give satisfactory result .",
    "yet , the scaling forms obtained in this paper can be expound in the spirit of the physical reasoning given in @xcite , as will be explained in the following paragraph .",
    "we shall first focus on closed hws on @xmath37 with the maximal number of two - stranded @xmath40 conformations within the unit tetrahedrons .",
    "such hws represent maximally entangled closed ( mec ) compact conformations and they accomplish the maximal possible connectedness between the generators @xmath37 of all orders @xmath30 .",
    "now , from all the @xmath38 sites visited by such maximally entangled hw , observe those which belong to one - stranded conformations ( @xmath39-steps ) within the unit tetrahedrons , and which are directly connected only with the sites belonging to the same unit tetrahedron .",
    "for instance , vertices 9 and 10 , or 15 and 16 in represent examples of such sites . since these sites are not directly connected with the other tetrahedrons of the lattice ( via hw )",
    ", they are the maximally isolated sites within the maximally entangled closed hw conformation .",
    "it is shown in [ app : diskusija ] that number @xmath194 of such sites is equal to @xmath195 and one can easily see that , using this expression , scaling relation for the numbers od closed hws can be transformed into the following form @xmath196 in a similar way ( see [ app : diskusija ] ) , one can show that scaling relation for open hws can be expressed as @xmath197 where @xmath198 is the number of maximally isolated sites on @xmath37 visited by maximally entangled open hw ( which is an open hw with the maximal number of @xmath40-steps on unit tetrahedrons and with both loose ends being of type @xmath107 , on all levels @xmath30 ) .",
    "comparing forms and with the scaling relations expected for hws on homogeneous lattices , one can say that in this case terms @xmath199 and @xmath200 play the role of the stretched exponential correction term @xmath9 in the case of homogeneous lattices .",
    "indeed , for homogeneous lattices @xmath201 , with @xmath19 , is proportional to the number of sites on the lattice boundary , which have smaller number of neighbors than the bulk sites , and in that sense they are similar to the maximally isolated sites within the maximally entangled hws on 3d msg lattices .",
    "therefore , one might generally expect that scaling relation for the number of hws on nonhomogeneous lattices instead of stretched exponential correction term has a term @xmath202 , where @xmath203 is the number of conveniently defined `` maximally isolated sites '' .",
    "relation between @xmath203 and the overall number of lattice sites @xmath3 depends on the particular topology of the lattice under study , which is the reason why different scaling forms , as functions of @xmath3 , are obtained .    conclusion of the previous paragraph can be supported by performing a similar analysis in the case of hws on previously studied fractal families @xcite .",
    "for instance , for @xmath22-simplex fractals maximally isolated sites can be defined in a similar way as for 3d msg fractals , _",
    "i.e. _ these are the sites which are directly connected by maximally entangled hw only with the sites within the same fractal generator they belong to . here , maximally entangled hws are those that contain maximal number of maximally - stranded hw parts .",
    "then , it can be shown @xcite that @xmath204 and @xmath205 , where @xmath206 .",
    "since overall numbers of closed and open hws on @xmath22-simplex fractal with even @xmath22 asymptotically behave as @xmath207 ( see ( 5.8 ) in @xcite ) and @xmath208 ( formula ( 5.14 ) in @xcite ) , respectively , they immediately fit into the scaling relation @xmath209 , where @xmath210 and @xmath211 for both types of hws . for odd values of @xmath22 , however , it can be shown @xcite that number @xmath203 of maximally isolated sites , for both open and closed hws , is proportional to @xmath38 , so that any term of the form @xmath202 can only contribute to the leading term @xmath6 .",
    "this certainly is in accord with the scaling forms found in @xcite for odd @xmath22 , which do not have stretched exponential corrections .    to conclude",
    ", we may say that presented exact study of hamiltonian walks on modified three - dimensional sierpinski gasket fractals supports the idea that entangled conformations are of the most physical importance for the behavior of compact polymers in inhomogeneous media .",
    "the introduced concept of `` maximally isolated sites '' proved to be useful in physical interpretation of different scaling forms obtained for hamiltonian walks on all so far studied fractals . whether such concept can be applied on homogeneous and other nonhomogeneous lattices will be the matter of our further investigations .",

    "it is not difficult to show that the number of junctions which connect @xmath43 generators @xmath37 into the generator @xmath31 is equal to @xmath216 from the restraint that each site of the lattice has to be visited exactly once , follows that each junction ( _ i.e. _ its middle point ) can be traversed at most once . now , suppose that closed hw conformation within @xmath31 consists of @xmath217 @xmath39-steps and @xmath218 @xmath40-steps .",

    "here we give some details of derivation of the conclusion that numbers of two - leg hw configurations are not needed for obtaining the scaling form of the overall number of open hws .",
    "first we notice that recursion relation for the two - leg hw configuration of the type @xmath108 , given in , follows from the fact that dangling ends of the two strands can reside either ( 1 ) in the same generator @xmath37 , thus forming @xmath108 or @xmath109step within it , or ( 2 ) in two different generators @xmath37 , thus forming two one - leg steps , either of @xmath106 or @xmath107type .",
    "it is not difficult to see that case ( 1 ) can be obtained by cutting a step of some @xmath39type configuration .",
    "therefore , each @xmath39type configuration with @xmath49 @xmath39steps and @xmath50 @xmath40steps gives rise to @xmath49 @xmath108type configurations with @xmath307 @xmath39steps , @xmath50 @xmath40steps and one @xmath108step , which are obtained by cutting a @xmath39step , whereas by cutting its @xmath40steps ( which can be done in two ways for each @xmath40step ) one can obtain @xmath308 different @xmath108type configurations with @xmath49 @xmath39steps , @xmath309 @xmath40steps and one @xmath109step . in a similar way , by cutting an @xmath40type hw configuration , one can obtain an @xmath109type configuration . from these observations",
    "straightforwardly follows that @xmath310 applying a reasoning similar to one used in the previous appendix , one can obtain that polynomials @xmath311 and @xmath312 , corresponding to two - leg configurations with dangling ends in different generators , have the following forms @xmath313 with @xmath314 and @xmath315 being constant positive integers , @xmath316 , and @xmath317    next , recursion relations are obtained by dividing with the recursion relation for @xmath46 , given in .",
    "therefore , coefficients @xmath158 are defined as @xmath318 and @xmath319 as @xmath320 where @xmath321 corresponds to @xmath322 , respectively . then , from and relations directly follow .    for @xmath101 , @xmath66 tends to 0 , so that from one obtains @xmath323 finally , using these approximate forms while multiplying with , relation is obtained , with coefficients @xmath170 equal to @xmath324 and @xmath325",
    "in this appendix we want to derive the formulae and for the numbers @xmath194 and @xmath326 of maximally isolated sites within the maximally entangled closed ( mec ) and maximally entangled open ( meo ) hamiltonian walks , respectively . since mec hws on the generator @xmath37 of order @xmath30 are closed hws with the maximal number of @xmath40-steps , and maximally isolated sites within mec hw are `` interior '' vertices of @xmath39-steps made through unit tetrahedrons ( _ i.e. _ not the vertices at which hw enters or exits the tetrahedron ) , number @xmath194 is equal to @xmath327 where @xmath328 is the number of unit tetrahedrons traversed by @xmath39-steps . in order to calculate @xmath328 , and consequently @xmath194 , we observe maximally entangled @xmath39-type ( meb ) hws , _",
