    "the measurement and analysis of the peculiar velocities of galaxies forms a major probe of the cosmic structure formation process .",
    "the galaxy velocities reflect the large - scale matter flows which according to the gravitational instability scenario for cosmic structure formation go along with the formation and emergence of structure in the universe .",
    "they are the response to the gradually unfolding underlying inhomogeneities in the cosmic matter distribution . as a result , the comparison of the induced cosmic flows on megaparsec scales with the underlying matter distribution represents a potentially powerful instrument to further our insight into the dynamics of cosmic structure formation process and in inferring the values of a variety of key cosmological parameters .    over the past two decades",
    "a major effort has been directed towards compiling large samples of galaxy peculiar velocities ( see @xcite and @xcite for reviews of the subject ) . by opening up the window on the dynamics of the cosmic structure formation process the analysis of these catalogues of galaxy peculiar velocities",
    "has lead to enormous progress in our understanding of the process .",
    "this is particularly true for scales larger than @xmath3 , scales on which structure formation still resides in the linear phase of development .",
    "in particular the mark iii catalog , with an effective depth @xmath4 , stands as a landmark achievement @xcite .    despite the successes progress has remained limited given the sizeable random and systematic errors that beset catalogues of peculiar velocities of galaxies and clusters .",
    "it allowed the mapping of the cosmic flow field in only a rather restricted volume of the nearby universe .",
    "perhaps even more significant is that the low quality of the peculiar velocity data , in combination with their inhomogeneous and sparse spatial distribution , has prevented the development of an equally compelling and complete view of cosmic dynamics at the higher spatial resolution needed to probe and understand the dynamics of nonlinear structures .",
    "it is on these scales of a few megaparsec that the structure formation process has progressed to the more advanced quasi - linear stage and has left an imprint of genuinely recognizable cosmological structures and patterns .",
    "the characteristic flattened and filamentary features of the cosmic web , as well as the underdense void regions , are particularly outstanding examples .",
    "as yet it has not been possible to map the flows in and around these emerging structures .",
    "progress in the study of large scale motions will not only depend on the availability of a substantially larger , better defined and considerably more accurate sample of galaxy peculiar velocities .",
    "equally important will be the use of a more sophisticated machinery to handle the discrete , sparse and usually inhomogeneously sampled galaxy velocity datasets .",
    "it does remain a challenge to transform these into properly defined velocity maps throughout the surveyed volume .",
    "it brings to the fore the issues of interpolation of discrete data to any location within a given volume as well as the issue of the choice for a proper filtering prescription . as a consequence of the specific choices and assumptions involved with a particular method",
    "not all information inherent in the dataset is preserved , and the resulting analysis does usually not include all available large and small scale properties of the peculiar velocity field . as for the first issue , the data interpolation , the measured peculiar velocities need to be interpolated into regions devoid of data .",
    "a conventional approach is that of interpolation of the discrete data set to regular grid locations by means of a fixed interpolation kernel .",
    "a notable example is that of the tsc kernel ( see * ? ? ?",
    "it is straightforward to show , however , that this will result in a mass - weighted quantity  @xcite .",
    "this has confused comparisons with analytically derived results , as most of these concern volume - weighted quantities .",
    "the second aspect is that of the filter choice for the interpolation procedure .",
    "one may apply a _ fixed _",
    ", _ global _ or _ local _ filter kernel . for sensibly defined field values",
    "it is important that data get filtered over an appropriately large volume . amongst other",
    ", shot - noise effects should be suppressed .",
    "conventionally , the galaxy peculiar velocities are filtered on a uniform fixed scale set by the requirement that also the sparsest sampled regions are properly averaged over .",
    "the resulting velocity map is one in which all the velocity information on scales smaller than the filter size has been filtered out .",
    "the most widely applied example is that of gaussian filters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this study",
    "we investigate the performance of the _ delaunay tessellation field estimator _",
    " dtfe  towards recovering the spatial density field and velocity flow in the nearby universe .",
    "dtfe is a self - adaptive density estimation and multidimensional interpolation scheme which does not make use of any artificial , user - specified filtering @xcite .",
    "currently dtfe is the most elaborate tessellation - based filter and interpolation scheme available to the field of astrophysics and astronomy ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : nnadapt ] ) .",
    "it belongs to a wider generic class of natural neighbour interpolations schemes . as a linear multidimensional field interpolation scheme dtfe",
    "may be regarded as the linear first - order equivalent of the higher order natural neighbour algorithms ( nn - neighbour ) for spatial interpolation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "dtfe and nn - neighbour schemes are based upon the use of the voronoi and delaunay tessellations of a given spatial discrete point set @xcite ( see @xcite for an excellent and extensive overview ) .",
    "voronoi and delaunay tessellations epitomize a purely locally defined division of space .",
    "their self - adaptive nature concerns both spatial resolution and local geometry , to which they adjust through their definition as region of influence amidst their _ natural neighbours_. dtfe uses the high level of sensitivity of the voronoi / delaunay tessellation to the local point distribution to produce an estimate of the local density at each sample point @xcite . for telling illustrations see @xcite .",
    "subsequently , it uses the delaunay tessellation as multidimensional spatial interpolation grid .",
    "unique within the context of nn - neighbour techniques .",
    "dtfe includes the explicit extension towards the self - adaptive determination of density fields on the basis of the spatial distribution of the point set itself , defined by @xcite .",
    "also important is that its linear nature ascertains its applicability to large data sets involving more than a million points .",
    "we apply dtfe to the study of the spatial mass distribution and velocity field in the local universe on the basis of a sample of galaxy positions and velocities inferred from the psc@xmath0  catalog @xcite .",
    "a uniform , densely sampled and fully volume - covering sample of galaxy peculiar velocities in the local universe does not ( yet ) exist .",
    "we take the alternative of using the galaxy velocities and positions inferred from the uniform all - sky psc@xmath0  galaxy redshift sample .",
    "the psc@xmath0  galaxy sample is the last and best defined galaxy redshift selection from the iras catalog @xcite .",
    "this context guarantees the near uniform and well - defined depth and sky coverage essential for a self - consistent reconstruction of density and velocity fields within its volume of the nearby universe @xcite .",
    "although this involves a reconstruction on the basis of linear perturbation theory and the velocity field therefore does not contain proper nonlinear components the spatial patterns outlined by the galaxies positions do provide a reasonable spatial configuration to test dtfe over its ability to recover patterns in the velocity field .",
    "this case study will demonstrate the virtues and potential of the dtfe method in the analysis of observational data , in particular in the capacity of dtfe to reveal intricate anisotropic patterns and that of rendering the multiscale character of both density and velocity fields .",
    "the objective of this study is first and foremost the production of maps of the volume - weighted velocity and density fields throughout the nearby universe .",
    "the self - adaptive nature of the dtfe technique yields an optimal resolution of the most interesting features , and this will enable the identification of characteristic patterns in the flow field and of their principal sources in the local density field . by default  to the dtfe method  this includes shear flows , ( super)cluster infall and void outflow . by illuminating their relationship to the nearby and surrounding large scale structures",
    "the dtfe procedure will help in increasing our understanding of the dynamics of the formation of the various structural components of the cosmic web @xcite ( also see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "an additional aspect of the presented study is the dtfe performance in a non - uniformly sampled galaxy distribution .",
    "because the psc@xmath0  galaxy catalog on which our analysis is based involves a flux - limited selection of galaxies the sampling density gradually decreases outward .",
    "while dtfe is capable of correcting the density values accordingly it also introduces a differential resolution scale along the reconstructed density and velocity field maps .",
    "while dtfe guarantees the preservation of an optimal share of information on the velocity field , this will automatically diminish with the outwardly decreasing selection function and the corresponding decrease in sampling density .",
    "the spectral coverage of the reconstructed dtfe fields will therefore be seriously affected towards the outer region of the psc@xmath0  volume , the velocity field reconstructions less so as they are dominated by lower frequency components .",
    "we introduce the psc@xmath0  sample in section 2 , along with a short description of the linearization process to produce the sample of galaxy positions and ( peculiar ) velocities .",
    "this is followed by an outline of the dtfe procedure for density and velocity fields in section 3 . a cosmographic description of the spatial structures within the psc@xmath0  volume of the local universe is contained in section 4 , after which in section 5 we turn to the velocity flow field within the same volume .",
    "the issue of the differential spatial resolution of the dtfe density and velocity maps is discussed at some length in section 6 , while we describe some four specific features in the local universe in section 7 .",
    "finally , we discuss the spatial distribution of the velocity divergence field and its relation with the density distribution . given the rather scant information on the velocity shear field we briefly treat its appearance in section 9 .",
    "section 10 concludes our study with a summary and a description of prospects and relation to other work .",
    "for the study of the structure and kinematics of the local cosmic neighbourhood we base outselves upon the psc@xmath0  catalog .",
    "the iras - psc@xmath0  catalog @xcite is an extension of the @xmath5-jy catalog @xcite .",
    "it contains @xmath6 galaxies with a flux at @xmath7 m larger than @xmath8-jy . for a full description of the catalog , selection criteria and the procedures used to avoid stellar contamination and galactic cirrus , we refer the reader to @xcite . for our purposes",
    "the most important characteristics of the catalog are the large area sampled ( @xmath9 of the sky ) , its depth with a median redshift of @xmath10 , and the dense sampling ( the mean galaxy separation at @xmath11 is @xmath12 ) .",
    "it implies that pscz contains most of the gravitationally relevant mass concentrations in our local cosmic neighbourhood , certainly sufficient to explain and study the cosmic flows within a local volume of radius @xmath13 .",
    "because of the flux - limited nature of the psc@xmath0  catalog , there is a decrease in the objects sampling as a function of distance from the observer .",
    "this is quantified by the radial selection function of the catalog , @xmath14 , where the selection function is defined as the fraction of the galaxy number density that is observed above the flux limit at some distance @xmath15 . to ascertain the proper number density of objects each galaxy",
    "is weighed by the inverse of the selection function ( see eqn .",
    "[ eq : densvornu ] ) . for the selection function we used the expression @xmath14 described in @xcite .",
    "in addition to this selection function correction , further necessary corrections are that for the @xmath16 of the missing sky devoid of data , due to the cirrus emission and unobserved areas , and that for redshift distortions . here",
    "we have followed @xcite in using their spatially reconstructed psc@xmath0  catalog .      to translate the redshift space distribution of galaxies in the pscz catalog into galaxy positions and velocities in real space we use base our study on a galaxy sample which has been processed by the linear theory for gravitational instability  @xcite .",
    "our sample has been obtained along the lines of _ method i _ described in @xcite .",
    "the method is a specific realization of an iterative technique to minimize redshift - space distortions @xcite . for a detailed exposition of the method",
    "we refer to @xcite . starting with the original redshift distribution as input and computing the corresponding peculiar velocity fields , the spatial position of each galaxy",
    "is corrected accordingly .",
    "this is repeated in each iterative step until the spatial distribution of the galaxies and the inferred peculiar velocities are mutually consistent . in order to minimize the uncertainties derived from the lack of information on scales larger than the psc@xmath0  catalog",
    ", the velocity predictions in the pscz region were made in the local group frame [ lg ] .    in order to translate the distribution of galaxies into a gravitational field , and implied velocity field a value for the @xmath17 parameter , the ratio between the linear velocity field factor @xmath18 @xcite and the ( supposedly ) linear bias factor @xmath19 between galaxy and mass density , needs to be assumed .",
    "a value of @xmath20 has been adopted .",
    "the reliability of the corresponding modelled density and velocity has been confirmed in several studies , including density - density and velocity - velocity comparisons with other surveys ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "while the reconstruction procedure assumes linearity , one may expect its validity to extend into the early nonlinear stages @xcite .",
    "at hindsight , this claim may indeed be confirmed given the recovery by our dtfe technique of well - behaved mildly nonlinear density and velocity divergence distribution functions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pscz_den - div_pdf ] and sect .",
    "[ sec : divvpdf ] ) .    an important condition for a consistent linear reconstruction of the velocity and density field is that the density fluctuations should have a small amplitude . in order to ascertain this",
    "the gravity field has been smoothed with a tophat filter whose radius is @xmath21 within the inner @xmath22 and subsequently increases following the average intergalaxy distance ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : pscz_intergal ] ) .",
    "an additional implicit requirement for the linearization process is that the vorticity modes in the peculiar velocity field are to be minimized .",
    "for the well - defined and representative sample of pscz catalog this is accomplished for @xmath23 . for comparison",
    ", it may be worthwhile to realize that a gaussian kernel of @xmath24 was employed by @xcite to obtain a succesfull and representative linearization of the measured velocity field of the mark iii catalog @xcite .",
    "a complication for the linearization procedure is that of the velocity field around high density regions . in the immediate surroundings of clusters of galaxies ,",
    "the inflow of matter becomes so fast that they turn into triple - valued redshift regions .",
    "@xcite addressed this problem by considering two different samples . in one sample",
    "the triple - valued regions were collapsed , in the other they were not .",
    "results showed that the implicit smoothing procedure of the linearization procedure minimizes this effect .",
    "differences between collapsed and uncollapsed samples are less than @xmath25 for the bulk flow and velocity shear components , and consistent at the @xmath26 level . here",
    "the velocity model which leaves the triple - valued regions uncollapsed has been followed .",
    "-0.5truecm    the final product of the linearization velocity reconstruction procedure is a galaxy catalog containing for each individual galaxy its _ real spatial position _ and its _",
    "peculiar velocity_. our dtfe analysis of the psc@xmath0  density and velocity field is based upon this density and linearized velocity field .",
    "the delaunay tessellation field estimator ( dtfe ) interpolation method was introduced by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , for rendering fully volume - covering and volume - weighted fields from a discrete set of sampled field values , including the density field as defined by the point sampling itself .",
    "dtfe involves an extension of the interpolation procedure described by @xcite , who used delaunay tessellations for the specific purpose of estimating the cosmic velocity divergence field , and showed the method s superior performance with respect to conventional interpolation procedures .",
    "the dtfe method is based upon the _ voronoi and delaunay tessellations _ of the point sample ( see * ? ? ? * , and references therein ) .",
    "a delaunay tetrahedron is defined by the set of four points whose circumscribing sphere does not contain any of the other points in the generating set @xcite ( triangles in 2d ) .",
    "the delaunay tessellation is intimately related to the voronoi tessellation of the point set , they are each others _ dual_. the voronoi tessellation of a point set is the division of space into mutually disjunct polyhedra , each polyhedron consisting of the part of space closer to the defining point than any of the other points @xcite . these spatial volume - covering divisions of space into mutually disjunct triangular ( 2-d ) or tetrahedral ( 3-d ) cells adapt to the local density and geometry of the point distribution .",
    "astronomical exploitation of voronoi and delaunay tessellations have as yet remained rather limited , despite the fact that a great many studies are based on observations which by their nature represent a discretely and irregularly sampled probe of an underlying smooth distribution .",
    "nonetheless , in recent years the self - adaptive virtues of voronoi tessellations have been recognized in a gradually increasing stream of astronomical studies .",
    "most of these seek to use the density sensitivity of voronoi cell volumes and even delaunay cell volumes to detect density peaks like clusters of galaxies amidst a general background of galaxies . in astronomy ,",
    "the first application of voronoi tessellations as density / intensity estimators was forwarded by @xcite , who sought to identify x - ray clusters as overdensities in x - ray photon counts .",
    "more recently , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite used similar algorithms to isolate clusters within catalogues of galaxy positions produced by galaxy sky or redshift surveys .",
    "the explicit and additional ability of the more elaborate dtfe formalism to trace sharp density contrasts impelled @xcite to compute the surface density map for a galaxy from the projection of the dtfe volume density field .",
    "the obtained surface density map was used to compute the gravitational lensing pattern around the object , upon which @xcite evaluated the method in its ability to trace higher - order singularities .      the point in case for its pattern tracing characteristics is provided by the right - hand panel of figure  [ fig : pscz_lin_vel ] ( also see fig .  4 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , showing the 2-dimensional delaunay triangulation for a section along the @xmath0-supergalactic plane through the galaxy set which we analyze in this work , the psc@xmath0  catalog .",
    "the dtfe method exploits these virtues and adapts automatically and in an entirely natural fashion to changes in the density or the geometry of the distribution of sampling points . instead of involving user - defined filters which are based upon artificial smoothing kernels",
    "the resulting main virtue of dtfe is that it is intrinsically _ self - adaptive_. in essence , it involves filtering kernels which are defined by the _ local density and geometry _ of the point process or object distribution .",
    "the voronoi tessellation is used to obtain optimal _ local _ estimates of the spatial density ( see sect .",
    "8.5 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the tetrahedra of its _ dual _ delaunay tessellation are used as multidimensional intervals for linear interpolation of the field values sampled or estimated at the location of the sample points ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch . 6 ) .    on the basis of its interpolation characteristics",
    "dtfe is the first order version of a wider class of tessellation - based _ multidimensional _ and entirely _ local _ interpolation procedures , commonly known as _ natural neighbour interpolation _ @xcite ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "6 ) . in a variety of applied sciences",
    "the concept of natural neighbour interpolation and other advanced tessellation applications have already found wide application . particularly successful and noteworthy",
    "examples may be found in computer visualisation and surface rendering , geophysics ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and engineering mechanics @xcite .",
    "a crucial aspect of the success of the delaunay interpolation procedure @xcite is that it reproduces the _ volume - weighted _ velocity field , correcting a few fundamental biases in estimates of higher order velocity field moments . while , often unintentionally , most conventional interpolation schemes yield the _ mass - weighted _ velocity , it are the _ volume - weighted _ velocity estimates which figure in analytical expressions .",
    "this is particularly true for velocity field perturbation analyses within the context of gravitational instability scenarios based on primordial gaussian perturbations .",
    "the validity of the delaunay ( and therefore also dtfe ) velocity field interpolation scheme is perhaps most strongly emphasized by its success in reproducing the nonlinear velocity divergence distribution function , specifically in its detailed agreement with second order perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the derived distribution function appears to be so accurate that it enables the accurate determination of cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "this is even more interesting as a mildy non - gaussian velocity divergence distribution would enable the breaking of the degeneracy between the cosmic matter density @xmath27 and the bias @xmath19 between the matter and galaxy distribution@xcite .",
    "an essential and unique step of the dtfe procedure concerns the determination of field values at the sample points . for the velocity field this simply involves the measured velocities at the sample points .",
    "more complex is the issue for the density / intensity field .",
    "tessellation - based methods for estimating the density have been introduced by @xcite and @xcite . on the condition that the sample points are sampled proportionally to an underlying density / intensity field",
    ", the voronoi tessellation is used to define optimal  local  density estimates @xcite .",
    "a minor modification was introduced by  @xcite : in order to assure the mass - conserving nature of the dtfe interpolation procedure the sample point density estimates relate to the _ contiguous _ voronoi cell ( see fig .  [ fig : pscz_lin_vel ] ) .    amongst the nn - neighbour schemes , dtfe is unique in including the tessellation - based density estimates on the basis of the sampling point distribution itself . by restricting itself to a linear interpolation scheme",
    "it remains feasible to apply the method to data sets of millions of points .",
    "the latter is essential for the viability of the technique within a cosmological context .",
    "three major characteristics of the megaparsec scale universe are the ( 1 ) the _ weblike _ spatial arrangement of galaxies and mass into elongated filaments , sheetlike walls and dense compact clusters , ( 2 ) the existence of large near - empty _ void regions _ and ( 3 ) the hierarchical nature of the mass distribution , marked by substructure over a wide range of scales and densities . according to the standard paradigm of cosmic structure formation ,",
    "the theory of gravitational instability @xcite this intricate spatial pattern has emerged as a result of the gravitational growth of tiny ( gaussian ) density perturbations and the accompanying tiny velocity perturbations in the primordial universe . @xcite demonstrate the ability of dtfe to succesfully reproduce and quantify these key aspects of the nonlinear weblike cosmic matter distribution in the megaparsec universe :    * the hierarchically structured matter distribution is resolved to the smallest possible resolution scale set by the particle number density . * dtfe retains the morphology cq .",
    "shape of the features and patterns in the matter distribution .",
    "the characteristic anisotropic filamentary and planar features of the _ cosmic web _ are fully reproduced in the continuous dtfe density field . *",
    "the near - empty voids in the spatial matter distribution are reproduced optimally .",
    "both their flat internal density distribution as well as their sharp outline and boundary are recovered in detail through the interpolation characteristics of the dtfe algorithm as well as by its tendency to suppress the shot noise in these sparsely sampled regions @xcite .",
    "the relation between the cosmic density and cosmic velocity field is an important piece of information on the dynamics of the cosmic structure formation process .",
    "when dtfe is applied to n - body simulations of structure formation , it does manage to succesfully reproduce the physical and spatial correlation between cosmic density and velocity fields for highly nonlinear structures .",
    "an early analysis of a gif @xmath28bodysimulation did show a few remarkable examples ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : the velocity flows in and around the cores of high - density regions  for as long as it concerns single - stream laminar flows  are traced in detail by the dtfe density and velocity maps . within the same simulations ,",
    "the voidlike regions were rendered as super - hubble expanding bubbles , consistent with our view of void dynamics @xcite .",
    "considerably more detailed recent studies  @xcite confirmed that dtfe manages to trace the correspondence between velocity and density field over a large range of scales , resolving both small and large scale features of the velocity field .    extrapolating this observation , and encouraged by the success of voronoi - based methods in identifying dark halos in n - body simulations @xcite",
    "@xcite used dtfe to assess the six - dimensional phase space density distribution of dark halos in cosmological @xmath29-body simulations . while a fully six - dimensional analysis may be computationally cumbersome @xcite",
    ", the splitting of the problem into a separate spatial and velocity - space three - dimensional tessellation may indeed hold promise for an innovative analysis of the dynamical evolution of dark halos .",
    "the performance of dtfe has been tested extensively with respect to the performance of the rigid grid tsc method and the spatially adaptive sph method .",
    "the tsc procedure is rigid with respect to the spatial scale as well as the shape of the mass distribution .",
    "sph kernels are adaptive with respect to the local density of points but lack sensitivity to the geometry of the mass distribution .",
    "@xcite present numerous tests of the ability of dtfe to resolve spatial substructure and to detect anisotropic features .",
    "with respect to spatial resolution , dtfe manages not only to resolve maps of self - similar soneira - peebles models with the highest spatial resolution but also to recover the underlying scaling indices .",
    "both the tsc and sph fields fail completely in reproducing the proper scaling properties .",
    "while tsc does not produce any scaling at all , sph does manage to reproduce scaling of the density field over a wide range of spatial scales .",
    "however , it fails fully in recovering the proper scaling indices .",
    "in addition , dtfe is also the only procedure whose density field has an _ autocorrelation function _ which agrees completely , down to the smallest scales , with the _ two - point correlation function _ of the soneira - peebles point distribution .    also with respect to its ability to recover weblike features in the cosmic matter distribution",
    "the virtue of dtfe with respect to the tsc and sph methods becomes more evident . while the sph procedure fares considerably better than tsc its spherical smoothing kernel",
    "does introduce some artefacts and deficiencies when it gets to resolving the finest features .",
    "defined by a fixed number of neighbours , sph tends to smear out the smallest structures , particularly for anisotropically shaped ones , and results in features which occupy a significantly larger volume than the corresponding galaxy distribution .",
    "however , also dtfe patterns do contain some artefacts , of which the triangular imprint of its smoothing kernel is the most pronounced one .",

    "interesting features may also be observed in other regions of the sample volume : an interesting filamentary extension towards [ sgy , sgz]@xmath128 \\hmpc$ ] can be observed in the y - z map .",
    "vorticity is not expected to play any role of significance as a result of the `` linearized '' origin of our pscz velocities .",
    "the top - hat filter of @xmath181 used to defined the velocity sample is an ensurance for the linearity of practically all sample velocity data .",
    "the presence of vorticity in our dtfe reconstructions should therefore provide us with a reasonably good impression of the influence of systematic artefacts in our maps .",
    "regions populated with considerable large or abundant clusters ( e.g. great attractor , pisces - perseus ) , do retain some measure of vorticity , even after smoothing .",
    "also the dtfe method itself also introduces a small spurious vorticity component as a result of its linear interpolation scheme .",
    "a careful analysis of this artefact in our maps , and the effects for the dtfe velocity reconstruction , will be presented in @xcite .",
    "the delaunay tessellation field estimator ( dtfe , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has been applied to a combined analysis of the density and velocity flow field in the local universe .",
    "the prime objective of this study has been the production of optimal resolution three - dimensional maps of the volume - weighted velocity and density fields throughout the nearby universe , the basis for a detailed study of the structure and dynamics of the cosmic web at each level probed by underlying galaxy sample . in order to have a reasonably complete sample of galaxy peculiar velocities throughout the surrounding local universe we used the psc@xmath0  galaxy redshift catalog translated into galaxy positions and velocities by means of the method i linearization process of @xcite .",
    "the spatial galaxy distribution of the psc@xmath0  catalog defines a voronoi and delaunay tessellation .",
    "these epitomize the most pure locally defined division of space in the psc@xmath0  volume . the self - adaptive nature of the voronoi / delaunay tessellations concerns both spatial resolution and local geometry . the high level sensitivity to the local point distribution",
    "is exploited by dtfe @xcite to produce an estimate of the local density at each sample point .",
    "the delaunay tessellation is subsequently used as adaptive multidimensional spatial interpolation grid .",
    "the construction of the voronoi and delaunay tessellation is the most demanding task of the dtfe routine .",
    "once this has been accomplished , they can be used for both the density and velocity field ( and basically any relevant field ) .    because dtfe is based upon linear interpolation and",
    "involves constant field gradients within each delaunay tetrahedron , the analysis of the cosmic velocity field automatically yields maps of the velocity divergence , shear and even vorticity .",
    "the spatial distribution of these quantities in dtfe is marked by a discontinuous zeroth order map marked by delaunay regions in which divergence , shear or vorticity has a constant value . to sensibly relate the dtfe velocity divergence and shear fields it is necessary to smooth over a scale comparable to that of the corresponding delaunay cells .",
    "earlier studies @xcite have made clear that dtfe is particularly optimalized for the analysis of mass distributions marked by one or more of the essential aspects of the nonlinear cosmic web of the megaparsec universe @xcite .",
    "one of the main advantages of dtfe is its large dynamic range , allowing it to trace small scale structures along with the large scale environment in which they are embedded .",
    "the spatial and morphological adaptivity of dtfe is ideally suited for dissecting the essential components of the nonlinear weblike cosmic matter distribution .",
    "it resolves a hierarchically structured matter distribution to the smallest possible resolution scale set by the particle number density .",
    "perhaps most outstanding is the ability of dtfe to retain the morphology cq .",
    "shape of the features and patterns in the matter distribution : the characteristic anisotropic filamentary and planar features of the _ cosmic web _ are fully reproduced in the continuous dtfe density field @xcite .",
    "also the third major characteristic of the nonlinear megaparsec universe , the dominant existence of near - empty voids , is resolved by dtfe .",
    "both their flat internal density distribution as well as their sharp outline and boundary are recovered in detail , while shot noise in these sparsely sampled regions tends to be suppressed .",
    "the maps of the psc@xmath0  local universe reveal a sharply defined density field in which many familiar structures and features can be recognized at an optimal spatial resolution .",
    "the region around the local group and its filamentary extension towards the hydra - centaurus and shapley complexes as well as the pisces perseus supercluster are prominently resolved in the dtfe density fields . moreover , these features are as clearly and sharply defined in the corresponding velocity flows .",
    "perhaps the most outstanding features in the velocity vector fields are the radially expanding void regions . in comparison to earlier published maps of the density field and velocity flow in the psc@xmath0  sample volume",
    "@xcite the dtfe maps have a considerably sharper defined appearance . while conventional maps suppressed small scale details and were at loss in undersampled void regions , in particular wrt the interpolation of the velocity field , the dtfe fields reveal a beautifully textured flow field .",
    "the dtfe flows are marked by prominent bulk flows , shear flows and radial inflow ( coma cluster ) .",
    "arguably the most outstanding and unique feature of the dtfe maps is the sharply defined radial outflow regions in and around underdense voids , marking the dynamical importance of voids in the local universe .",
    "the present study includes two specific aspects and challenges for dtfe : ( 1 ) the application of dtfe to reconstruct the density field as well as the corresponding velocity field in the same cosmic volume and ( 2 ) the gradually diminishing spatial resolution as a function of radial distance as a consequence of the flux - limited nature of the psc@xmath0  sample .",
    "while one may correct estimated density values by taking into account the well - defined radial selection function , it is not possible to correct for the loss in spatial resolution : the lower galaxy sampling density goes along with a loss , at increasing distances , in spectral coverage of the maps .",
    "a full recovery would have to involve pre - conceived notions on the cosmological structure formation scenario , cq .",
    "the power spectrum .",
    "the relatively prominent central values in the density , velocity divergence and shear maps are a reflection of this effect . on the other hand",
    ", the velocity field itself  less affected by the lack of high frequency spectral power at large distances  for all practical purposes appears to be uniformly covered by the dtfe reconstruction .",
    "the sharply outlined edges of superclusters and the radial outflow of voids are found throughout the psc@xmath0  volume .",
    "we have addressed the relationship between the density field and velocity field by correlating the density values with the local velocity divergence and shear .",
    "overall , the linear density - velocity divergence relationship is accurately reproduced .",
    "this reflects the origin of the galaxy velocities , having been computed from a redshift map through a linearization procedure .",
    "these simple quantitative relations do not express the spatial coherence and correlations within the velocity field .",
    "the tight spatial correspondence between density features and velocity flows in the dtfe maps  voids with radial outflow , elongated and flattened superclusters with bulk and shear flows  does demonstrate the remarkable adaptive nature of the dtfe technique and its promise of understanding the dynamics of the cosmic web .",
    "the maximum expansion rate of voids defines a sharp cutoff in the velocity divergence pdf .",
    "it enabled us to test the self - consistency of the dtfe method .",
    "indeed it confirmed the value of @xmath182 of the cosmology underlying the galaxy velocity data .    for furthering our insight into the velocity field in the nearby universe it would be desirable to be able to probe quasi - linear contributions to the velocity field .",
    "techniques like the fam@xmath183 of @xcite , applied in combination with the dtfe algorithm , would offer a potentially promising approach . while this study has shown the potential of dtfe towards a succesfull analysis of velocity fields it concerns a test on the basis of a sample of pre - processed galaxy velocities .",
    "this includes the assumption that the velocity field linearization @xcite has succesfully dealt with redshift - space distortions and sampling effects .",
    "ultimately we will seek to develop a dtfe - based formalism to directly analyze samples of galaxy peculiar velocities on the basis of the `` raw '' observational data .",
    "the challenge is found in a few aspects .",
    "one aspect concerns errors and sampling effects .",
    "a second aspect involves redshift distortions .",
    "a third complicating aspect involves fundamental assumptions behind the velocity field reconstruction procedure , such as the requirement of laminarity of the flow .",
    "an extensive study of various sampling effects , such as decreased sampling density and inhomogeneous sampling , on simulation - based data do show that the noise level of the dtfe velocity reconstructions does increase but that this does not involve any systematic shifts @xcite . given the acclaimed optimal triangulation properties of delaunay grids underlying the development of dtfe",
    "this may not come as a surprise . the same study involved tests of the effects of a variety of different error contributions .",
    "they induced similar effects as a less balanced galaxy sampling .",
    "these results will be presented in an extensive study and report on error and sampling effects in a forthcoming paper . more challenging issues concern the physically more profound aspects of redshift distortions and higher - order flow characteristics . as a first - order version of the wider class of natural - neighbour interpolation schemes @xcite",
    ", dtfe may be extended to a higher - order natural neighbour interpolation scheme based upon the delaunay tessellation of a galaxy sample .",
    "such a formalism would enable a more complex treatment of nonlinear velocity flows , possibly even of multistream flows .",
    "already we have been working towards the implementation of these higher - order interpolation schemes ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review on the basics ) , and we plan to look into the possibility on the basis of routines made available through ` cgal `  . on the other hand , highly mixed virialized regions will remain beyond the scope of these interpolation techniques .",
    "this may hardly be considered a constraint given the fact that for the foreseeable future the focus of nearly all galaxy peculiar velocity surveys will be the dynamics of large scale structures .",
    "the inversion from redshift to real space data may be facilitated and enabled by using the virtues of a delaunay grid for the solution of pdes .",
    "the use of delaunay tessellations as grids for the numerical solution of pdes has been first described by @xcite , their success provides substantial imperative for the formulation of the redshift space to real space inversion following these lines .    in the meantime dtfe has been elaborated upon through the development of a number of specific feature detecting techniques .",
    "the mmf @xcite forms a highly promising tool for selection and identification of filamentary and planar structures and their spatial relationship with neighbouring structures .",
    "the watershed based void detection algorithm developed by @xcite has been applied towards the analysis of the hierarchical evolution of voids ( see * ? ? ? * ) . in all cases , the fully adaptive and optimal tessellation based characteristics of dtfe form the crucial starting point .",
    "we are very grateful to e. branchini for providing us with the pscz sample of galaxy positions and linearized velocities .",
    "also we wish to thank w. schaap for the use of dtfe routines and for useful comments and f. bernardeau for crucial advice .",
    "we greatly benefited from discussions about velocity fields and delaunay tessellations with bernard jones and manolis plionis .",
