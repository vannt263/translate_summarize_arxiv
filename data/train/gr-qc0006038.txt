    "it has been known for a long time that owing to planar property and mutual focussing , colliding plane waves ( cpw ) result in spacelike singularities [ 1 ] .",

    "[ 2 ] , however constitutes an example contrasting this category , namely , it possesses a cauchy horizon ( ch ) instead of a spacelike singularity .",
    "naturally , this solution initiated a literature devoted entirely on the quest of stability of horizons formed hitherto .",
    "ch formed in spacetimes of cpw was shown by yurtsever to be unstable against plane - symmetric perturbations [ 3 ]",
    ". a linear perturbation analysis by cx reveals also an analogues result [ 4 ] .",
    "any such perturbation applied to a cpw spacetime will turn the ch into an essential singularity .",
    "a second factor that proved effective in weakening the strength of a singularity in cpw is the electromagnetic ( em ) field itself . in other words , the degree of divergence in",
    "the curvature scalars of colliding pure gravitational waves turn out to be stronger than the case when em field is coupled to gravity .",
    "in particular , collision of pure em waves must have a special significance as far as singularity formation is concerned .",
    "such an interesting solution was given by bell and szekeres ( bs ) which describes the collision of two linearly polarized step em waves [ 5 ] .",
    "the singularity ( in fact a ch ) formed in the interaction region of the bs solution was shown to be removable by a coordinate transformation .",
    "on the null boundaries , however it possesses esential curvature singularities which can not be removed by any means .",
    "since cross polarization and em field both play roles in the nature of resulting singularity it is worthwhile to purse these features together .",
    "this invokes a cross polarized version of the bs ( cpbs ) solution which was found long time ago [ 6,7 ] .",
    "this metric had the nice feature that the weyl scalars are all regular in the interaction region .",
    "cross polarization , however , does not remove the singularities formed on the null boundaries . in this paper",
    "we choose cpbs solution as a test ground , instead of bs , with various added test fields to justify the validity of a ch stability conjecture proposed previously by helliwell and konkowski ( hk ) [ 8,9 ] . unlike the tedious perturbation analysis of both cx and yurtsever the conjecture seems to be much economical in reaching a direct conclusion about the stability of a ch .",
    "this is our main motivation for considering the problem anew , for the case of untested solutions in cpw . in this paper",
    "we look at the spacetimes : a ) single plane wave with added colliding test fields and b ) colliding plane waves having non - singular interaction regions with test field added , fig.1 illustrates these cases",
    ".    the terminology of singularities should be follwed from the classification presented by ellis and schmidt [ 10 ] .",
    "singularities in maximal four dimensional spacetimes can be divided into three basic types : quasiregular ( qr ) , scalar curvature ( sc ) and non - scalar curvature ( nsc ) . the ch stability conjecture due to hk is defined as follows .    for all maximally extended spacetimes with ch",

    ".    expressed otherwise , the conjecture suggests to put a test field into the background geometry and study the reaction it will experience . if certain scalars diverge then in an exact back - reaction solution the field will respond with an infinite strength to the geometry ( i.e action versus reaction ) .",
    "such an infinite back - reaction will render a ch unstable and convert it into a scalar singularity . + the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we review the cpbs solution and the correct nature of the singularity structure is presented in appendix a. section iii , deals with geodesics and test em and scalar field analyses . in section iv , we present an exact back reaction calculation for the collision of cross polarized em field coupled with scalar field .",
    "the derivation of weyl and maxwell scalars are given in appendix b. the insertion of test null dusts to the background cpbs spacetime and its exact back reaction solution is studied in section v. appendix c is devoted for the properties of this solution .",

    "it can be seen easily that for @xmath10 the metric reduces to bs . unlike the bs metric , however , this is conformally non - flat for @xmath11 , where the conformal curvature is generated by the cross polarization . as a matter of fact",
    "this solution is a minimal extension of the bs metric .",
    "a completely different generalization of the bs solution with second polarization was given by cx [ 11 ] .",
