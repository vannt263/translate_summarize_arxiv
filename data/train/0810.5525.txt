    "superdeformed nuclei were first observed in fission isomers in the actinide region @xcite .",
    "a theoretical explanation of the occurrence of fission isomers , based on shell effect corrections on the liquid drop potential energy surface , was , at then , offered by strutinsky @xcite .",
    "the main result was the possible existence of a second minimum in the potential energy as function of nuclear deformation .",
    "it is expected nowadays that a third minimum may occur corresponding to hyper - deformed nuclei @xcite .",
    "a superdeformed rotational band in @xmath4dy in the form of series of @xmath5-ray energies was first populated in the heavy - ion fusion - evaporation reaction @xmath6pd ( @xmath7ca , 4n ) @xmath4dy @xcite . since then extensive experimental and theoretical studies have been undertaken . at present superdeformed bands",
    "have been observed in various atomic mass region @xcite .",
    "most notable regions are at @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 in which axes ratios are , respectively , close to @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "superdeformed nuclei enjoy several characteristics that make them of particular interest theoretically and experimentally .",
    "for beside their extreme shape and stability against fission they show great regularity in their rotational bands and exhibit some type of universal phenomenon in relation to the existence of nearly identical bands in pairs of nuclei in different mass region and as a result their dynamic moments of inertia are approximately similar @xcite .",
    "it is expected that the process of the decay of superdeformed nuclei to normal deformed nuclei could proceed through quantum tunneling @xcite .    for high - spin ,",
    "superdeformed rotational spectra follow , in general , approximately that of a rigid rotor . hence the kinematics and the dynamic moments of inertia are nearly constant with slight gradual increase with angular momentum , at low angular frequency . at high angular frequency",
    "the dynamic moment of inertia shows irregular behavior .    in this work we consider the q - deformation of the enveloping lie algebra @xmath14 @xcite , which has recently attracted much interest for the calculation of rotational spectra of deformed @xcite and superdeformed nuclei @xcite .",
    "the validity of the standard @xmath14 model has , however , been recently questioned @xcite . a generalized form of the model which is obtained by replacing the angular momentum spectral expression @xmath15 by @xmath16 has been used to describe successfully the vibrational , transitional and the rotational nuclear spectra of well deformed nuclei @xcite .",
    "here we apply this generalized form to the calculation of the rotational transition energies , the kinematic moments of inertia and the dynamic moments of inertia for 79 superdeformed energy bands in the region @xmath17 , and compare it with the experimental data .",
    "a sensitive measure of the applicability of a model to superdeformed bands is the dynamic moment of inertia .",
    "this is becuse , it is inersely proportional to the difference of the transition energies and these transition energies are closly spaced .",
    "the model shows remarkable agreement with the experimental data in the rotational region at low angular frequency ( @xmath18 @xmath19 ) . a comparison with the standard @xmath14 model is also made .",
    "it is also shown that in addition to the previously predicted deviation of the standard @xmath20 in the case of deformed nuclei , it does so for the case of the superdeformed nuclei considered in this work .",
    "it is also concluded , contrary to the expectation of reference @xcite , that in the rotational region the generalized @xmath14 does not in general coincide with the standard one .    in the following section we present a brief description of the model and in the next section we present our results and conclusion .",
    "the @xmath21algebra is a @xmath22 deformation of the @xmath23 lie algebra and is generated by the operators , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , which obey the commutation relations @xcite@xcite : @xmath27   = \\pm j_{\\pm},\\mathrm{\\;\\;\\;\\;}\\left [ j_{+},j_{-}\\right ]   = \\left [   2j_{0}\\right ]   , \\label{comut}\\ ] ]    with @xmath28 = @xmath25 , @xmath29= @xmath24 and @xmath30   $ ] is the @xmath22 number defined as @xmath31   = \\frac{q^{x}-q^{-x}}{q - q^{-1}}\\label{grindeq2}\\ ] ]    in terms of the parameterization @xmath32 , this equation takes the form : @xmath31   = \\frac{e^{\\tau x}-e^{-\\tau x}}{e^{\\tau}-e^{-\\tau}}=\\frac{\\sinh\\tau x}{\\sinh\\tau}\\label{grindeq3}\\ ] ] in the @xmath14 formalism it is suggested that rotational spectra of nuclei can be well described by a hamiltonian proportional to the second - order casimir operator of the quantum algebra of @xmath20 in a manner similar to that of the @xmath33 rotator algebra ..    the second - order casimir operator of @xmath14 is : @xmath34   \\left [   j_{0}+1\\right ] \\label{grindeq4}\\ ] ]    with eigenvalues @xmath35",
    "\\left [   i+1\\right ]   $ ] .",
    "a deformed @xmath22 like - rotor is a quantum system described by the @xmath20 invariant hamiltonian @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the moment of inertia for @xmath38 and @xmath39 the bandhead energy .",
    "the parameters @xmath37and @xmath39 are regarded as constants of the model . the rotational energy spectrum can be then expressed as @xmath40   } { \\sin^{2}\\left\\vert \\tau\\right\\vert } + e_{0}\\label{grindeq6}\\ ] ]    where here a pure imaginary @xmath41is assumed .    an extended version of this model is obtained by replacing @xmath42 by @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",
    "the addition of the parameter c allows for the description of nuclear anharmonicities in a way similar to that of the interacting boson model and the generalized variable moment of inertia model .",
    "the energy spectrum in this case becomes : @xmath45   } { \\sin^{2}\\left\\vert \\tau\\right\\vert } + e_{0},\\label{grindeq7}\\ ] ]    which contains three parameters : the moment of inertia @xmath46 , the deformed parameter @xmath47 , and the anaharmonicity parameter @xmath48 .    in our application of the model in order to fit the three parameters in equation we make use of the transition energies of 79 sd bands in the @xmath1 region that are reported for the nuclei au , tl",
    ", bi , pb , and po @xcite . the kinematic @xmath49 and the dynamical moment of inertia @xmath50 are calculated from the following defining relations :    @xmath51(\\hbar^{2}mev^{-1})\\label{grindeq8}\\ ] ] @xmath52(\\hbar^{2}mev^{-1})\\label{grindeq9}\\ ] ]    where the transition energy @xmath53 is @xmath54    we have used as a quantitative measure for best fit the root mean square ( rms ) @xmath55 defined as : @xmath56    where @xmath57  is the number of levels fitted .",
    "a representative sample of the fitting parameters and the rms of the two models , for the studied nuclei , are presented in table i and table ii",
    ". out of the 79 studied sd bands 20 of them have the anharmonic parameter @xmath58 which we do not include in the tables , since they lead to no comparison between the two models .",
    "these bands are:@xmath59bi sd , @xmath60hg sd3 , @xmath61hg sd1 , sd4 , @xmath62hg sd2 , sd3 , @xmath63hg sd6 , @xmath64hg sd3 , @xmath63pb sd2 , @xmath64pb sd2 , @xmath59pb sd2 , sd3 , sd4 , sd5 , sd6 , @xmath62tl sd1 , sd2 , @xmath61tl sd2 , @xmath63tl sd3 , sd4 .",
    "in addition 12 sd bands ( @xmath61au sd3 , @xmath65hg sd1 , @xmath60hg sd4 , @xmath62hg sd1 , @xmath66hg sd1 , @xmath64hg sd2 , @xmath60tl sd2 , @xmath63tl sd5 , @xmath63pb sd1 , @xmath64pb sd3 , @xmath67pb sd4 , @xmath68pb sd2 )  have @xmath69 , which are out side the rotational region @xcite . figs .",
    "1 - 2 clearly illustrate that our calculations of the moments of inertia are in good agreement with experimental data at low angular frequency .",
    "both models give good fit for the kinematic moment of enertia but they show marked disagreement for the dynamic moment of inertia at high angular frequency .",
    "the models fail to account for the uprising and the down turn of the dynamic moment of inertia .",
