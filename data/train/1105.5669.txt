    "we have characterized concept classes @xmath0 that are distribution - free pac learnable under the family of all non - atomic probability measures on the domain .",
    "the criterion is obtained without any measurability conditions on the concept class , but at the expense of making a set - theoretic assumption in the form of martin s axiom .",
    "in fact , assuming martin s axiom makes things easier , and as this axiom is very natural , perhaps it deserves its small corner within the foundations of statistical learning .    generalizing the result over function classes , using a version of the fat shattering dimension modulo countable sets ,",
    "did not pose particular technical difficulties .",
    "however the finiteness of this combinatorial parameter is no longer necessary for pac learnability of a function class under non - atomic measures , just like it is the case for the classical distribution - free situation",
    ".    it would be still interesting to know if the present results hold without martin s axiom , under the assumption that the concept class @xmath0 is image admissible souslin ( @xcite , pages 186187 ) .",
    "the difficulty here is selecting a measurable learning rule @xmath13 with the property that the images of all learning samples @xmath52 , @xmath102 , are uniform glivenko - cantelli .",
    "an obvious route to pursue is the recursion on the borel rank of @xmath0 , but we were unable to follow it through .",
    "now , a concept class @xmath0 will be learnable under non - atomic measures provided there is a hypothesis class @xmath86 which has finite vc dimension and such that every @xmath51 differs from a suitable @xmath498 by a null set .",
    "if @xmath0 consists of all finite and all cofinite subsets of @xmath1 , this @xmath86 is given by @xmath14 .",
    "one may conjecture that @xmath0 is learnable under non - atomic measures if and only if it admits such a `` core '' @xmath86 having finite vc dimension .",
    "is this true ?",
    "another natural question is : can one characterize concept classes that are uniformly glivenko  cantelli with respect to all non - atomic measures ?",
    "apparently , this task requires yet another version of shattering dimension , which is strictly intermediate between talagrand s `` witness of irregularity '' @xcite and our vc dimension modulo countable sets .",
    "we do not have a viable candidate .",
    "is it possible to construct an example of a concept class of finite vc dimension which is not consistently pac learnable @xcite without additional set - theoretical assumptions , just under the zfc axiomatics ?    finally , our investigation open up a possibility of linking learnability and vc dimension to boolean algebras and their stone spaces .",
    "this could be a glib exercise in generalization for its own sake , or maybe something deeper if one manages to invoke model theory and forcing .",
    "the author is most grateful to two anonymous referees for their thorough reading of the paper and numerous useful suggestions which have helped to improve the presentation considerably .",

    "<S> the new parameter can be also expressed as the classical vc dimension of @xmath0 calculated on a suitable subset of a compactification of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we do not make any measurability assumptions on @xmath0 , assuming instead the validity of martin s axiom ( ma ) . </S>",
    "<S> similar results are obtained for function learning in terms of fat - shattering dimension modulo countable sets , but , just like in the classical distribution - free case , the finiteness of this parameter is sufficient but not necessary for pac learnability under non - atomic measures .    </S>",
