    "capacity of a noisy information channel characterizes the amount of information per one symbol which is reliably transmitted through the channel in the limit of a long message send @xcite .",
    "this general definition can be made more precise , as one specifies what kind of information is transmitted and which additional resources can be used . for a discussion on different classes of channel capacities see e.g.  @xcite .    in particular , the capacity of a classical channel characterizes the average number of classical bits of information that can be reliably transmitted through the channel in a long sequence of symbols .",
    "alternatively , it refers to the average dimensionality of a discrete vector space such that every vector of symbols from this space transmitted through the channel can be recovered with a high fidelity with a help of a suitable error correction scheme .",
    "analogously , the quantum capacity @xmath0 of a quantum channel characterizes the average number of qubits per a single use of the channel that can be reliably recovered from long sequences of transmitted states .",
    "alternatively , this capacity characterizes the average dimensionality of the hilbert subspace such that every quantum state belonging to this subspace can be transmitted through the channel and recovered with a vanishing error . in consequence ,",
    "a quantum channel of a positive quantum capacity can preserve coherent superposition of states or quantum entanglement at least for some quantum states .",
    "the action of a quantum channel can be modeled by an interaction of a quantum system with an environment .",
    "capacity of a quantum channel can be expressed  @xcite in terms of the _ coherent information _ , defined as the difference between the von neumann entropy of the output state and the entropy of the environment after the evolution  @xcite  see sec .",
    "[ definitions ] . a transformation which maps an input state into the state of the environment after the evolution",
    "is called the _ complementary channel _  @xcite .    although the definitions of the classical and the quantum channel capacities are similar , these two notions differ in several ways . to show this consider the _ dephasing channel _ , which for a given basis removes all off  diagonal elements of the density matrix .",
    "this channel transforms any coherent superposition of pure orthogonal states into their statistical mixture , however , any classical state remains unchanged .",
    "therefore , the classical capacity of this channel can be positive , while its quantum capacity is equal to zero , as there does not exist even a two - dimensional hilbert subspace which survives the action of the channel  @xcite . in the present work we study a family of _ selfcomplementary _ quantum channels , which transform an input state and an initial state of the environment into two identical states . by definition ,",
    "the coherent information of such a channel and its quantum capacity are equal to zero , while its classical capacity can be positive .",

    "we show that in contrast to the dephasing channel , a generic selfcomplementary channel is not entanglement breaking  @xcite , as it can preserve some residual coherences .",
    "the fact that the quantum channel capacity of a selfcomplementary channel is equal to zero can be related with the famous no  cloning theorem , see sec .",
    "[ sec : remarks ] .",
    "since the no  cloning theorem does not hold for classical states , which are orthogonal or coincide , the classical channel capacity of a selfcomplementary channel can be positive .    we study also memory effects induced by the time evolution under the action of selfcomplementary channels .",
