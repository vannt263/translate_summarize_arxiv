    "it is a well - known fact that the continued fraction expansion of a real number can be analyzed in terms of the dynamics of the interval map @xmath4 , known as the _ gauss map_. a generalization of this map is given by the family of _ @xmath1-continued fraction transformations _",
    "@xmath5 , which will be the object of study of the present paper . for each",
    "@xmath6 $ ] , the map @xmath7 \\to [ \\alpha-1 , \\alpha]$ ] is defined as @xmath8 and , for @xmath9 , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a positive integer .",
    "each of these maps is associated to a different continued fraction expansion algorithm , and the family @xmath5 interpolates between maps associated to well - known expansions : @xmath12 is the usual gauss map which generates regular continued fractions , while @xmath13 is associated to the _ continued fraction to the nearest integer _ , and @xmath14 generates the _ by - excess continued fraction _ expansion . for more about @xmath1-continued fraction expansions , their metric properties and their relations with other continued fraction expansions we refer to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this family has also been studied in relation to the brjuno function @xcite , @xcite .",
    "every @xmath5 has infinitely many branches , and , for @xmath15 , all branches are expansive and @xmath5 admits an invariant probability measure absolutely continuous with respect to lebesgue measure .",
    "hence , each @xmath5 has a well - defined metric entropy @xmath16 : the metric entropy of the map @xmath5 is proportional to the speed of convergence of the corresponding expansion algorithm ( known as _ @xmath1-euclidean algorithm _ ) @xcite , and to the exponential growth rate of the partial quotients in the @xmath1-expansion of typical values @xcite .",
    "nakada @xcite , who first investigated the properties of this family of continued fraction algorithms , gave an explicit formula for @xmath16 for @xmath17 , from which it is evident that entropy displays a phase transition phenomenon when the parameter equals the golden mean @xmath18 ( see also figure [ tuningdiagram ] , left ) : @xmath19    several authors have studied the behaviour of the metric entropy of @xmath5 as a function of the parameter @xmath1 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) ; in particular luzzi and marmi @xcite first produced numerical evidence that the entropy is continuous , although it displays many more ( even if less evident ) phase transition points and it is not monotone on the interval @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "subsequently , nakada and natsui @xcite identified a dynamical condition that forces the entropy to be , at least locally , monotone : indeed , they noted that for some parameters @xmath1 , the orbits under @xmath5 of @xmath1 and @xmath21 collide after a number of steps , i.e. there exist @xmath22 such that : @xmath23 and they proved that , whenever the _ matching condition _ holds , @xmath16 is monotone on a neighbourhood of @xmath1 .",
    "they also showed that @xmath24 has _",
    "mixed monotonic behaviour _ near the origin : namely , for every @xmath25 , in the interval @xmath26 there are intervals on which @xmath16 is monotone , others on which @xmath16 is increasing and others on which @xmath16 is decreasing .",
    "in @xcite it is proven that the set of parameters for which holds actually has full measure in parameter space .",
    "moreover , such a set is the union of countably many open intervals , called _ maximal quadratic intervals_. each maximal quadratic interval @xmath27 is labeled by a rational number @xmath28 and can be thought of as a stability domain in parameter space : indeed , the number of steps @xmath29 it takes for the orbits to collide is the same for each @xmath30 , and even the symbolic orbit of @xmath1 and @xmath21 up to the collision is fixed ( compare to _ mode - locking _ phenomena in the theory of circle maps ) .",
    "for this reason , the complement of the union of all @xmath27 is called the _ bifurcation set _ or _ exceptional set _ @xmath2 .",
    "numerical experiments @xcite , @xcite show the entropy function @xmath16 displays self - similar features : the main goal of this paper is to prove such self - similar structure by exploiting the self - similarity of the bifurcation set @xmath2 .    the way to study the self - similar structure",
    "was suggested to us by the unexpected isomorphism between @xmath2 and the real slice of the boundary of the mandelbrot set @xcite . in the family of quadratic polynomials , douady and hubbard",
    "@xcite described the small copies of the mandelbrot set which appear inside the large mandelbrot set as images of _ tuning operators _ : we define a similar family of operators using the dictionary of @xcite .",
    "( we refer the reader to the appendix for more about this correspondence , even though knowledge of the complex - dynamical picture is strictly speaking not necessary in the rest of the paper . )",
    "our construction is the following : we associate , to each rational number @xmath28 indexing a maximal interval , a _ tuning map _ @xmath31 from the whole parameter space of @xmath1-continued fraction transformations to a subset @xmath32 , called _ tuning window_. note that @xmath31 also maps the bifurcation set @xmath33 into itself . a tuning window @xmath32 is called _ neutral _ if the alternating sum of the partial quotients of @xmath28 is zero .",

    "let us now briefly recall the main construction of @xcite , which will be essential in the following .",
    "each irrational number has a unique infinite continued fraction expansions , while every rational number has exactly two finite expansions . in this way",
    ", one can associate to every rational @xmath113 two finite strings of positive integers : let @xmath114 be the string of even length , and @xmath115 be the one of odd length .",
    "for instance , since @xmath116=[0;3,2,1]$ ] , the two strings associated to @xmath117 will be @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "let us remark that , if @xmath120=[0;s_1]$ ] then @xmath121 .",
    "now , for each @xmath122 we define the _ quadratic interval _ associated to @xmath28 as the open interval @xmath123 whose endpoints are the two quadratic irrationals @xmath124 $ ] and @xmath125 $ ] .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath28 always belongs to @xmath27 , and it is the unique element of @xmath126 which is a convergent of both endpoints of @xmath27 .",
    "in fact @xmath28 is the rational with minimal denominator in @xmath27 , and it will be called the _ pseudocenter _ of @xmath27 .",
    "let us define the _ bifurcation set _ ( or _ exceptional set _ in the terminology of @xcite ) as    @xmath127\\setminus \\bigcup_{r \\in ( 0 , 1)\\cap \\mathbb{q } } i_r\\ ] ]    the intervals @xmath27 will often overlap ; however , by ( @xcite , prop .",
    "2.4 and lemma 2.6 ) , the connected components of @xmath128\\setminus { \\mathcal{e}}$ ] are themselves quadratic intervals , called _ maximal quadratic intervals_. that is to say , every quadratic interval is contained in a unique maximal quadratic interval , and two distinct maximal quadratic intervals do not intersect .",
    "this way , the set of pseudocenters of maximal quadratic intervals is a canonically defined subset of @xmath129 and will be denoted by @xmath130 we shall sometimes refer to @xmath131 as the set of _ extremal rational values _ ; this is motivated by the following characterization of @xmath131 :    [ stringlemma ] a rational number @xmath132 $ ] belongs to @xmath131 if and only if , for any splitting @xmath133 of @xmath60 into two strings @xmath62 , @xmath63 of positive length , either @xmath134 or @xmath135 with @xmath136 odd .    using this criterion , for instance , one can check that @xmath137 $ ] belongs to @xmath138 ( because @xmath139 ) , and so does @xmath140 $ ] , while @xmath141 $ ] does not ( indeed , @xmath142 ) .",

    "note that , from remark [ inclusion ] and ergodicity of the gauss map , it follows that the lebesgue measure of @xmath33 is zero .",
    "let us now relate the previous construction to the dynamics of @xmath1-continued fractions .",
    "the main result of @xcite is that for all parameters @xmath1 belonging to a maximal quadratic interval @xmath27 , the orbits of @xmath1 and @xmath21 under the @xmath1-continued fraction transformation @xmath5 coincide after a finite number of steps , and this number of steps depends only on the usual continued fraction expansion of the pseudocenter @xmath28 :    [ matching ] let @xmath27 be a maximal quadratic interval , and @xmath153 $ ] with @xmath154 even .",
    "let @xmath155 then for all @xmath30 , @xmath156    equation is called _ matching condition_. notice that @xmath112 and @xmath157 are the same for all @xmath1 which belong to the open interval @xmath27 . indeed ,",
    "even more is true , namely the symbolic orbits of @xmath1 and @xmath21 up to steps respectively @xmath112 and @xmath157 are constant over all the interval @xmath27 ( @xcite , lemma 3.7 ) .",
    "thus we can regard each maximal quadratic interval as a stability domain for the family of @xmath1-continued fraction transformations , and the complement @xmath33 as the bifurcation locus .",
    "one remarkable phenomenon , which was first discovered by nakada and natsui ( @xcite , thm .",
    "2 ) , is that the matching condition locally determines the monotonic behaviour of @xmath16 :    [ nakada ] let @xmath27 be a maximal quadratic interval , and let @xmath158 be as in theorem [ matching ] .",
    "then :    1 .   if @xmath159 , the entropy @xmath16 is increasing for @xmath30 ; 2 .",
    "if @xmath160 it is constant on @xmath27 ; 3 .   if @xmath161 it is decreasing on @xmath27",
    "let us now define _ tuning operators _ acting on parameter space , inspired by the dictionary with complex dynamics ( see the appendix ) .",
    "we will then see how such operators are responsible for the self - similar structure of the entropy .",

    "indeed , the exterior of the mandelbrot set is biholomorphic to the exterior of the unit disk @xmath536 the _ external ray _ at angle @xmath537 is the image of a ray in the complement of the unit disk : @xmath538 the ray at angle @xmath537 is said to _ land _ at @xmath539 if @xmath540 .",
    "this way angles in @xmath541 determine parameters on the boundary of the mandelbrot set , and it turns out that the binary expansions of such angles are related to the dynamics of the map @xmath530 .",
