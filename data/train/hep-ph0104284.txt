    "at the quark level , the decays @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 denotes either @xmath17 or @xmath18 , are generated by the short - distance effective hamiltonian for @xmath19 . or @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "] within the standard model ( sm ) , the decay @xmath14 proceeds via @xmath22 penguin and box - type diagrams , and its branching ratio is expected to be highly suppressed .",
    "likewise , the forward - backward ( fb ) asymmetry of the lepton in @xmath15 is exceedingly small .",
    "however , in models with an extended higgs sector these observables may receive sizable contributions , and thus provide a good opportunity to look for new physics .",
    "the models to be considered are a type - ii two - higgs - doublet model ( 2hdm ) and a supersymmetric extension of the sm with minimal flavour violation ( see , e.g. , )  that is , we assume the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix to be the only source of flavour mixing .",
    "an interesting feature of these models is that large values of @xmath4 , the ratio of the two vacuum expectation values of the neutral higgs fields , may compensate for the inevitable suppression by the mass of the light leptons @xmath17 or @xmath18 .",
    "the calculation of higgs - boson exchange diagrams contributing to the @xmath19 transition has been the subject of many investigations @xcite . as pointed out in ,",

    "our study extends previous analyses in several ways .",
    "we include , for example , other rare @xmath5 decays in addition to @xmath6 to constrain possible scalar and pseudoscalar interactions outside the sm .",
    "we also assess their contributions to various observables in @xmath24 transitions such as @xmath25 .",
    "so far all experimental results yield only upper bounds on the decay modes governed by @xmath24 .",
    "the best upper limits at present come from processes with muons in the final state , and we therefore concentrate on the @xmath26 mode .",
    "specifically , we address the viability of the short - distance coefficients in the presence of scalar and pseudoscalar interactions with the measured @xmath6 rate and the experimental bound @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) @xcite , as well as with the restrictions imposed by the upper limits on @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "the effective hamiltonian describing the quark transition @xmath19 in the presence of non - standard higgs bosons is reviewed in . in , we discuss the hadronic matrix elements required for the decays @xmath14 and @xmath29 .",

    "readers who are not particularly interested in the details of the computation , can skip this part and proceed to the discussion of our results , which are obtained in the framework of the type - ii 2hdm and supersymmetry ( susy ) with minimal flavour violation .",
    "attention is focused on the interesting case of large @xmath4 , and a comparison is made with the results of previous studies . in , we derive model - independent upper bounds on scalar and pseudoscalar interactions , and explore their implications for the branching fraction of @xmath31 , as well as the corresponding fb asymmetry , using presently available data on the decays @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 . as an application",

    "we have carried out a study of exclusive @xmath5 decays governed by the @xmath19 transition in extensions of the sm with minimal flavour violation and new scalar and pseudoscalar interactions , focusing on the dimuon final state , and taking account of existing experimental data on @xmath32 as well as the upper limits on @xmath34 and @xmath8 decays .",
    "we have restricted the discussion to the interesting case of large @xmath4 , which may compensate for the inevitable suppression of scalar and pseudoscalar couplings by the lepton mass of @xmath17 or @xmath18 .",
    "our main findings can be summarized as follows .",
    "we have presented in a model - independent manner expressions for the @xmath14 branching fraction and the differential decay spectrum of @xmath29 , together with the corresponding fb asymmetry , which is extremely tiny within the sm . in particular",
    ", we find that scalar and pseudoscalar interactions can , in principle , lead to striking effects in the decay distribution of @xmath13 , while the branching ratio of @xmath243 is essentially unaffected by the higgs - boson contributions .",
    "we have demonstrated that once the constraint from @xmath34 is taken into account , the effects of scalar and pseudoscalar couplings on the decay @xmath13 are much smaller . in view of the inherent uncertainty of the predictions for exclusive @xmath5 decays due to the form factors",
    ", it seems extremely unlikely that a measurement of the decay spectrum alone can provide a clue to new physics with scalar and pseudoscalar interactions .",
    "we have also investigated the fb asymmetry of @xmath9 in @xmath13 decay , which turns out to be at the level of a few per cent .",
    "our analysis suggests that the observation of a nominal fb asymmetry of , say , @xmath11 , together with a branching ratio of about @xmath12 , will be challenging but might be feasible at the lhc and the tevatron . as more precise data on the @xmath34 branching ratio",
    "are available , more stringent upper limits will be placed on the fb asymmetry due to scalar interactions .",
    "the essential conclusion of our model - independent analysis is that current experimental data on @xmath34 decay already exclude large values of the wilson coefficients @xmath267 and @xmath150 of scalar and pseudoscalar operators , so that striking effects are not likely to show up in the decay spectrum of @xmath13 and the corresponding fb asymmetry of the muon .",
    "even so , the fb asymmetry provides an independent window to physics beyond the sm , especially to models with an extended higgs sector , and its observation would be an unambiguous signal of new physics .    in extensions of the sm with minimal flavour violation , we have calculated the higgs - boson contributions to the wilson coefficients of scalar and pseudoscalar operators , and investigated how the new - physics parameters are constrained by existing experimental data on rare @xmath5 decays . within the type - ii 2hdm framework , where the higgs sector corresponds to the one of the mssm , we found no appreciable fb asymmetry or any large deviation from the sm prediction for the @xmath8 branching fractions .",
    "as for the decay @xmath34 , the branching ratio turns out to be in the range @xmath239@xmath240 for @xmath23 and @xmath238 , which is within the errors of the sm prediction of @xmath241 .",
    "ultimately , the smallness of the new - physics contributions is caused by the mass of the charged higgs boson , which is strongly constrained by the measured @xmath6 branching fraction ( @xmath268 ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that within the type - ii 2hdm there are no sizable new - physics effects on the @xmath5 decay modes described above , apart from @xmath32 .",
    "by contrast , within susy , the effects of chargino and neutral higgs - boson contributions on the @xmath34 branching fraction can be enormous while satisfying the @xmath6 bounds .",
    "we have considered a susy scenario with a scalar top quark with large mixing and a mass much lighter than the scalar partners of the light quarks .",
    "we find that for a given set of parameters obeying the @xmath269 constraint , the upper limit on @xmath198 severely constrains the masses of charginos and charged higgs bosons . as a typical result , the lower bound",
    "@xmath270 has been derived for @xmath259 , @xmath255 , and @xmath256 .",
    "the remaining observables are estimated to be @xmath271 and @xmath272 ( for @xmath262 ) , the latter being close to the present upper limits . clearly , the analysis of the decay @xmath34 is complementary to the study of @xmath8 and @xmath6 decays , which leads to constraints on the remaining short - distance coefficients , @xmath273 , and @xmath95 . a combined analysis of these decay modes , therefore , provides a powerful tool to constrain physics transcending the sm .",
