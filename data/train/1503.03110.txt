    "it is now well established that in graphene monolayers , the electronic excitations with crystal momentum close to the @xmath1 or @xmath2 points of the brillouin zone ( bz ) , are chiral quasiparticles behaving as massless dirac fermions .",
    "these excitations dominate the low temperature physics leading to a number of remarkable phenomena in clean samples.@xcite impurities , adatoms and structural defects change these properties and there has been a considerable effort to study and characterize the different types of defects and disorder in graphene @xcite as well as the effect of doping on them@xcite .    the problem of disorder and electron localization has attracted the attention of many groups for dirac fermions tend to elude localization in systems with anderson - type disorder.@xcite impurities leading to short range disorder at the atomic scale generate inter - valley mixing and break the symplectic symmetry opening the route to strong localization .",
    "bilayer graphene ( blg ) presents some fundamental differences due to its crystallographic structure .",
    "it consist of a stacking of two graphene layers and in the most common structure , known as the bernal stacking , only one of the two non - equivalent sites @xmath3 of the honeycomb lattice of the top layer lies on top of a site of the bottom layer .",
    "the resulting structure , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , induces a weak coupling of the two layers .",
    "the unit cell has four carbon atoms leading to four @xmath4-bands , two of them having a parabolic dispersion relation around the @xmath1 and @xmath2 points of the bz and that touch each other at the fermi energy @xcite .    in most of the experimental setups",
    ", blg lies on top of a substrate and the impurities are adsorbed on the top layer only .",
    "when atoms like hydrogen or fluorine are adsorbed they are bounded to a single c atom .",
    "one of the most interesting aspects of this system is that its electronic structure can be controlled with an electric field applied perpendicular to the layers @xcite . in biased blg",
    "a gap opens at the fermi level and impurities may induce a bound state in the gap @xcite . as noted in ref .",
    "[ ] , the impurity spectral density and the existence of the bound states may depend on the polarity of the field .",
    "a finite impurity concentration generates a gate dependent impurity band creating new and encouraging alternatives to control the transport properties .",
    "however , in contrast to the important activity in the study of disordered graphene , the problem of blg with a diluted concentration of adatoms inducing short range potentials has not been investigated in detail .    in this work",
    "we study the problem of a low concentration of impurities in biased and unbiased blg .",
    "we present a model that aims to describe fluorinated blg , an extension of the model of ref .",
    "[ ] used to discuss the experiments of ref . [ ] .    in section",
    "ii we present the model and revisit the single impurity problem . in section iii",

    "the last term of the hamiltonian describes the hybridization of the impurity and the graphene orbitals of the top layer @xmath33 with the sum taken over all the sites with an impurity on top , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the coordinate of site @xmath31a similar expression holds for @xmath36 .",

    "[ fig2 ] ) . for @xmath50",
    "the impurity spectral density @xmath51 has the characteristic structure of a resonant state , the real part of the self - energy shifts the maximum from @xmath52 towards the dirac point generating a narrow resonance at the renormalized energy @xmath53 . for the impurity parameters used in this calculation ,",
    "the renormalized energy is an order of magnitude smaller than the bare energy ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "close to the dirac point the impurity spectral density shows the characteristic @xmath55 behavior of the ldos of the @xmath22 sites . for @xmath56",
    "a gap opens at the dirac point and the impurity spectral density @xmath57 may show a bound state within the gap .",
    "an important effect of the polarity of the field @xmath16 is apparent from the figure : a _ negative _ voltage @xmath16 leads to a bound state within the energy gap close to the top of the valence band while for a _ positive _ @xmath16 the bound state energy ",
    "if observed  lies exponentially close to the conduction band edge .",
    "this is due to the structure of the ldos at the @xmath22 sublattice : for positive @xmath16 the ldos at the edge of the conduction band @xmath58 behaves as @xmath59 , as in the 4d electron gas where a strong coupling to the impurity is required to split a bound state out of the band ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1]e ) ) .    for impurities on the @xmath26 sites ( right panels of fig .",
    "2 ) the results are somewhat different .",
    "for @xmath50 the width of the impurity resonance is much broader due to the larger ldos of the underlying c atom . for small and _ positive",
    "_ @xmath16 the bound state lies close to the gap centre while for small _ negative _ @xmath16 no bound state occurs .",
    "this effect can be understand by looking at the ldos at the @xmath26 sites in the biased blg ( see fig 1e ) ) . there , the ldos of the conduction band for small and positive @xmath16 presents a 1d - like van hove singularity leading always to a bound state , while for @xmath60 a 3d - like singularity at the edge of the conduction band requires a minimum value of the parameters to split a state out of the band",
    "however , this effect , discussed in ref .",
    "[ ] , is observed only for extremely small values of the bias voltage .",
    "for physically relevant values of the gap , bound states occur for both polarities although their position depends on the sign of @xmath16 .",
    "these asymmetries illustrate the importance of the polarity of the electric field on the electronic structure of the impurity doped system .",
    "the variation of the impurity energy @xmath61 with @xmath16 depends on the way the electric field is induced in the system and on the characteristic of the impurity . to minimize the number of parameters in the model we present results with constant , @xmath16 independent , @xmath61 .",
    "having in mind the one impurity problem results , summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the more relevant case of many impurities can be easily interpreted .",
    "here we present results for the case of a small concentration of adatoms on the top layer .",
    "calculations using density functional theory show that , in the case of fluorine atoms , the adsorption energies on the two non - equivalent sites , @xmath22 and @xmath26 , are almost equal .",
    "some estimations , however , suggest that there could be a tiny energy gain for adatoms on the @xmath26 sites @xcite .",
    "interestingly , in other carbon based systems like monolayer graphene with substitutional nitrogen impurities , it has been observed that as the nitrogen concentration increases , impurities tend to be absorbed preferentially in one of the two equivalent sublattices @xcite .",
    "these self - organized structures of the nitrogen doped graphene are stabilized by the impurity - impurity interaction that favors impurities on the same sublattice , an effect that scales quickly with the impurity concentration @xcite . for the case of diluted fluorine adatoms on blg",
    "there are no evidences of clustering on one sublattice .",
    "moreover , the interaction between impurities on graphene is known to depend crucially on the type of impurity and on the adsorption geometry @xcite . based on these facts , in what follows",
    "we consider different impurity distributions , going from @xmath62 of the impurities in each sublattice to @xmath63 of them on the @xmath26 sites .",
    "we start with a detailed analysis of the ldos at the impurity and at the different sites of the blg .      to calculate @xmath57 in the many impurities case we first use the chebyshev polynomials method which has proven to be very efficient to deal with realistic impurity concentrations @xcite .",

    "a remarkable detail is the emergence of a small gap for @xmath73 .",
    "this gap is reminiscent of the gap that occurs in graphene monolayers for a finite concentration of impurities lying on the same sublattice @xcite .",
    "the effect is due to a global inversion symmetry breaking due to the different structure of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 sublattices . in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", disordered systems would not present real gaps but energy windows with exponentially small dos and it would be more appropriate to talk about pseudo - gaps rather than about real gaps .    for a gated system with positive @xmath68 ev the gap induced in the pristine blg",

    "the impurities generate a band that extends from the bottom of the conduction band towards the centre of the gap and is separated by a pseudo - gap from the valence band .",

    "[ fig3 ] . for @xmath50",
    "there is no pseudo - gap on top of the valence band . for positive @xmath16",
    "an impurity band is formed within the blg gap and a narrow resonance appears close to the bottom of the conduction band .",
    "the former is due to the impurities adsorbed on the @xmath26 sites while the later is due to the narrow resonance of the impurities on the @xmath22 sites ( see fig . [",
    "interestingly , for negative @xmath16 two separated and narrow impurity bands are formed within the blg gap .",
    "again , these bands are due to the impurities adsorbed on different sublattices , the lower energy one is narrower and comes from impurities on the @xmath22 sublattice .",
    "other impurity distributions , like the one shown at the central panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] where @xmath75 of the impurities are on the @xmath26 sublattice , can be viewed in a first approximation as an interpolation between the two previous cases where the spectral weight of the @xmath22 and @xmath26 impurities change according to their concentration .",
    "as we show below , in gated blg , the impurity bands formed within the gap of the pristine sample are bands of strongly localized states .    in order to better characterize the effect of impurities on the electronic structure of the system we evaluate the average ldos on the four non - equivalent sites of the blg , @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .",
    "notably , in some cases , for @xmath78 and @xmath56 , the ldos of the valence band of the host blg is almost unaffected by the impurities .",
    "in particular , the narrow van hove singularity of the @xmath24 sites is essentially insensitive to the presence of the adsorbate .",
    "this suggests that at least in the valence band no strong localization effects occur with this type of impurity doping . as we show in next section , in gated samples , clear evidence of strong localization",
    "are observed for states within the gap and close to the impurity resonances occurring in the conduction band .      to estimate the localization length @xmath79 we evaluate the two - point correlation function @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the retarded propagator from the impurity orbital at site @xmath82 to the one at site @xmath83 . in the localized regime",
    "this quantity decreases exponentially when the distance @xmath84 between impurities increases.@xcite for large @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) , the configurational average of its logarithm is well described by the following expression @xcite @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are fitting parameters .",

    "[ fig6 ] the localization length @xmath116 for the gated and ungated blg cases and different impurity distributions are shown for a cluster with typical radius of the order of @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the mean impurity - impurity distance .",

    "there , all states are strongly localized with a maximum of @xmath89 at the centre of the band .",
    "the impurity spectral density shows a sharp resonance at the bottom of the conduction band .",
    "this resonance is due to localized states that are much more extended than those in the gap . in the valence band",
    "the localization length is too large for a good estimation with the system size used in the calculation . for negative @xmath16 two narrow impurity bands , separated from each other and from the valence and conduction bands by small pseudo - gaps ,",

    "where two distinct strongly localized impurities bands may exist inside the gap , one could expect deviations of @xmath123 from a single vrh theory . in that case , a generalization of eq.(15 ) to the case of two narrow impurity bands might be needed .",
    "finally , due to the dependence of the low energies electronic structure on the polarity of the electric field , the model predicts a dependence of the transport properties on the sign of @xmath16 . such asymmetry is not clearly observed in experiments with fluorinated graphene @xcite . if all impurities where adsorbed on the @xmath26 sublattice these asymmetries would be difficult to observe due to the similarities on the dos and the localization length obtained for the two polarities , see top panels of fig .",

    "<S> . the effect of impurity doping on the local density of states with and without a gated electric field perpendicular to the layers is analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> we look for anderson localization in the different regimes and estimate the localization length . in the biased system , the field induced gap is partially filled by strongly localized impurity states . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the structure , distribution and localization length of these states depend on the field polarization . </S>"
