    "the faithful linear representations of bigelow - krammer - lawrence of the artin braid groups @xmath0 are probably one of the most important recent discoveries in the theory of braid groups , and as such , have been intensively studied over the last few years .",
    "they have also been extended to other groups , such as artin - tits groups of spherical type ( see for instance  @xcite ) . however , with the exception of a few results  @xcite , their generalisation in a more topological direction , to braid and mapping class groups of surfaces for example , as well as the linearity of these groups , are open problems in general .",
    "the aim of this paper is twofold .",
    "the first is to underline the relevance of short exact sequences of braid groups and their generalisations to the study of representations of these groups .",
    "as we shall recall in section  [ section2 ] , the burau and bigelow - krammer - lawrence representations appear when one studies certain ` mixed ' extensions of @xmath1 arising from fibrations at the level of configuration spaces .",
    "this extension splits , and in the simplest case , its kernel is the fundamental group of the @xmath2-punctured disc @xmath3 .",
    "the burau representation then occurs as the induced action of @xmath1 on the homology of the infinite cyclic covering @xmath4 of @xmath3 .",
    "the bigelow - krammer - lawrence representations may be obtained in a similar way in terms of the borel - moore middle homology group of a @xmath5-covering of @xmath3 ( see section  [ section2.3 ] for more details ) .",
    "motivated by these constructions , one possible strategy for obtaining linear representations of ( surface ) braid groups is to study exact sequences of these groups . with this in mind",
    ", we recall the definitions of surface braid groups and their short exact sequences in section  [ section3 ] , as well as the known results concerning the splitting of these sequences ( lemma [ lem : fibrations ] ) . in the case of the short exact sequence of `",
    "mixed ' artin braid groups , the induced short exact sequence on the level of commutator subgroups brings into play groups and homomorphisms that appear in the construction of bigelow - krammer - lawrence representations of @xmath1 ( see the end of section  [ section2.3 ] ) .    before stating similar results for exact sequences of surface braid groups , in section  [ section4 ] , we recall the basic definitions pertaining to the lower central series @xmath6 of a group @xmath7 , and",
    "we show that if @xmath7 is the braid or mixed braid group ( with a sufficiently large number of strings ) of a compact orientable surface @xmath8 with a single boundary component , the quotient group @xmath9 is a semi - direct product of free abelian groups .",
    "we provide group presentations for such quotients ( lemma [ lem : presgamma ] and corollary [ cor : decgammamix ] ) that will play an important rle in the rest of the paper .    in  @xcite , an and ko described an extension of the bigelow - krammer - lawrence representations of @xmath1 to braid groups of orientable surfaces of positive genus and with non - empty boundary .",
    "however , it is not currently known whether these representations are faithful .",
    "the representation is based on the regular covering arising from a projection of the @xmath2-th braid group of a surface @xmath10 with non - empty boundary onto a specific group @xmath11 , constructed in a technical manner in order to satisfy certain homological constraints ( section  3 and definition 2.2 of @xcite ) and which turns out to be a heisenberg group ; more recently , the above projection has been independently studied by christian blanchet to obtain a representation of a large subgroup of the torelli group of a surface with one boundary component containing the johnson subgroup @xcite .",
    "the second aim of our paper is to show that technical construction proposed in  @xcite of the representations may be described in terms of lower central series and exact sequences of surface braid groups : this is the object of section  [ section5 ] .",
    "as we mentioned above , in the case of artin braid groups , the induced short exact sequence on the @xmath12-level gives rise to elements used in the construction of the bigelow - krammer - lawrence representations . in the case of surface braid groups ,",
    "the corresponding construction on the same level does not work ( proposition [ nolinearext ] ) , but if we take this construction a stage further , to the @xmath13-level , we obtain the corresponding objects of the an - ko representations .",
    "more precisely we show how to use the @xmath13-level to extend bigelow - krammer - lawrence representations and we prove that such extensions are unique up to isomorphism ( propositions [ fondpropex ] and [ fondprop ] ) , according to definition [ fonddef ] .",
    "we finish the main part of the paper with another possible application of the lower central series of surface braid groups by showing that the standard length function on @xmath1 admits a unique extension to a homomorphism whose source is the braid group of a surface of positive genus with one boundary component ( proposition [ fondpropcons ] ) , and that there is no such extension if the surface is closed and orientable ( proposition [ fondpropcons2 ] ) . in an appendix , we discuss the relationship between the splitting of the ` mixed ' surface braid group sequences and that of their restriction to the corresponding pure braid groups . in the terminology of  @xcite",
    ", we show that this restriction never give rises to an _ almost - direct _ product ( an almost - direct product structure means that the extension is split , and that the induced action of the lower central series quotient @xmath14 on the kernel @xmath15 is trivial ) .",

    "surface braid groups are a natural generalisation of both the classical braid groups and of the fundamental group of surfaces .",
    "first defined by zariski during the 1930 s , they were re - discovered by fox during the 1960 s , and have been used subsequently in the study of mapping class groups .",
    "we recall the definition due to fox of these groups in terms of fundamental groups of configuration spaces  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath10 be a connected surface .",
    "let @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the set of @xmath2-tuples @xmath18 for which @xmath19 for some @xmath20 .",
    "the fundamental group @xmath21 is called the _ pure braid group _ on @xmath2 strands of the surface @xmath10 ; it shall be denoted by @xmath22 .",
    "there is a natural action of the symmetric group @xmath23 on @xmath24 by permutation of coordinates ; the fundamental group @xmath25 is called the _ braid group _ on @xmath2 strands of the surface @xmath10 and shall be denoted by @xmath26 .",
    "then @xmath24 is a regular @xmath27-fold covering of @xmath28 that gives rise to the following short exact sequence :    @xmath29    regarded as a subgroup of @xmath30 , the group @xmath31 acts on @xmath32 .",
    "the fundamental group @xmath33 will be called the _ mixed braid group of @xmath10 on @xmath34 strands _ , and shall be denoted by @xmath35 .",
    "notice that @xmath35 embeds canonically in @xmath36 .",
    "these intermediate groups between pure braid and braid groups of a surface , known as ` mixed ' braid groups , play an important rle in  @xcite .",
    "they were defined previously in  @xcite , and were studied in more detail in  @xcite in the case where @xmath10 is the @xmath37-sphere @xmath38 .",
    "we recall that @xmath39 is isomorphic to the pure braid group on @xmath2 strands , usually denoted by @xmath40 , while @xmath41 is isomorphic to the braid group @xmath0 on @xmath2 strands . in",
    "what follows , the mixed braid group on @xmath34 strands @xmath42 will be denoted simply by @xmath43 .    the fibration @xmath44 given by forgetting the first @xmath45 coordinates is a locally - trivial fibration whose fibre over a point @xmath46 may be identified with the orbit space @xmath47 .",
    "from now on we denote @xmath48 by @xmath49 .",
    "let us also denote @xmath50 by @xmath51 ; this group turns out to be isomorphic to the subgroup of @xmath52 consisting of braids where the last @xmath2 strands are trivial ( vertical ) .",
    "the long exact sequence in homotopy of the above fibration yields a short exact sequence .",
    "let @xmath53 .",
    "the fadell - neuwirth fibration @xmath54 induces the short exact sequence : @xmath55    in a similar way , we may obtain the more well - known short exact sequence of pure braid groups .",
    "@xmath56 here @xmath57 denotes the fundamental group of @xmath58 , which is isomorphic to the subgroup of @xmath59 consisting of pure braids where the last @xmath2 strands are vertical .",
    "notice that the short exact sequences @xmath60 and @xmath61 split for all @xmath62 , where the section is given geometrically by adding @xmath45 trivial strands ` at infinity ' ( see for instance @xcite ) .      when @xmath63 , the short exact sequence @xmath61 plays a central rle in the study of vassiliev invariants of braid groups and of lie algebras related to pure braid groups .",
    "we refer to @xcite for the classical case and to @xcite for analogous results in the case of surface braid groups .    in what follows , we will focus on the relevance of such short exact sequences to linear representations of braid groups and their topological generalisations .",
    "let us start with the case @xmath63 .",
    "the group @xmath0 may be interpreted as the mapping class group of @xmath49  @xcite .",
    "we thus obtain an action of @xmath0 on @xmath49 that induces an action on @xmath64 , the latter being isomorphic to the free group @xmath65 on @xmath2 generators .",
    "this action , which is faithful , coincides with the action by conjugation of @xmath0 on @xmath66 defined by the natural section of @xmath60 . in this way",
    ", we recover the famous artin representation of the braid group @xmath0 as a subgroup of the group of automorphisms of @xmath65 .",
    "analogously , we have an action of @xmath40 as the pure mapping class group of @xmath49 on @xmath67 what is faithful and coincides with the action by conjugation of @xmath40 on @xmath68 defined by the natural section of @xmath61 .",
    "composing the artin representation with the magnus representation associated to the length function @xmath69 ( see for instance @xcite ) we obtain the ( non reduced ) burau representation of @xmath0 . in the case of the pure braid group ,",
    "we obtain the gassner representation of @xmath40 ( @xcite ) in a similar way .",
    "the burau representation also has a homological interpretation ( see for instance chapter 3 of @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , it admits certain generalisations .",
    "indeed , for any @xmath70 we may observe that @xmath0 , regarded as the mapping class group of @xmath49 , acts on @xmath71 and therefore on its fundamental group , @xmath72 .",
    "the induced action of @xmath0 on @xmath72 coincides with the action by conjugation of @xmath0 on @xmath72 defined by the natural section of @xmath60 . in order to look for ( linear ) representations , we consider regular coverings associated with normal subgroups of @xmath72 , and we try to see if the induced action on homology is well defined . in other words , we wish to study surjections of @xmath72 onto a group @xmath73 subject to certain constraints .",
    "when @xmath63 , we consider as before the length function @xmath74 . since the action of @xmath0 on @xmath66 commutes with @xmath75 , @xmath0 acts on the regular covering @xmath76 of @xmath49 .",
    "the induced action on the first homology group of @xmath76 is the ( reduced ) burau representation of @xmath0 .",
    "for @xmath77 , let @xmath73 be the group @xmath78 .",
    "the corresponding morphism @xmath79 for @xmath77 sends the classical braid generators @xmath80 to @xmath81 and the generators @xmath82 , corresponding to the generators of @xmath64 , to @xmath83 . since the action of @xmath0 on @xmath72 commutes with @xmath84 , it turns out that @xmath0 acts on the regular covering of @xmath85 , and the induced action on the borel - moore middle homology group of such a covering space is in fact the @xmath45th bigelow - krammer - lawrence representation of @xmath0 . in this way",
    ", for @xmath77 we obtain faithful linear representations of @xmath0 ( see @xcite for @xmath86 and @xcite for @xmath87 ) .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a complete description of these constructions . in",
    "what follows , we first motivate the choice of the above projections @xmath79 using the lower central series of the corresponding groups .",
    "we then explain how the study of the lower central series of surface braid groups can be used to obtain the representations given in @xcite .",
    "we will define also the notion of extension of a representation in a completely algebraic manner , and its obstructions .",
    "if we wish to consider surjections of @xmath72 onto some group @xmath88 , in order to obtain a linear representation using the approach described above , the group @xmath88 should be abelian .",
    "considering the short exact sequence @xmath60 on the level of abelianisation , we obtain the following commutative diagram of short exact sequences : @xmath89   &   b_k({\\ensuremath{\\mathbb d}}_n )   \\ar[d]^{\\bar q_k }    \\ar[r ]     & b_{k , n }   \\ar[d]^{r_{k , n } } \\ar[r ]           &   b_n    \\ar[d]^{r_{n } } \\ar[r ]         & 1\\\\ 1 \\ar[r ]   &   \\ker \\bar\\psi_k   \\ar[r ]                           & b_{k , n}/ \\gamma_2(b_{k , n } )   \\ar[r ] &   b_n/ \\gamma_2(b_n )   \\ar[r ]    & 1 } } \\end{xy}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are abelianisation homomorphisms , and @xmath92 is the homomorphism satisfying @xmath93 .",

    "following  @xcite , we will call such a splitting extension an _ almost - direct _ product . the important remark for us in theorem 3.1 of @xcite is that such an exact sequences induces exact sequences on the level of the lower central series quotients ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "since @xmath40 is an iterated almost - direct product of free groups , @xmath40 ` inherits ' various properties of @xmath65 , and it is possible to use this structure to derive a presentation for the lie algebra associated to the lower central series of @xmath40 and to construct a universal finite type invariant for braid groups  @xcite . on the other hand , the fact that @xmath40 acts trivially on the abelianisation of @xmath65 allows us to compose the artin representation with the magnus representation , thus yielding the gassner representation ( we refer to @xcite for the details ) .",

    "the case @xmath111 was proved in  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath486 , as we recalled in section 3 , the sequence @xmath457 splits only if @xmath10 has boundary ( lemma  [ lem : fibrations ] ) . however , even when the sequence @xmath457 splits , the extension is never an almost - direct product .",
    "in fact , a straightforward calculation on the level of group presentations ( given for instance in @xcite ) shows that the natural section ( corresponding to adding a strand ` at infinity ' ) does not define a trivial action on the level of abelianisation ( see also relation ( _ v _ ) of proposition [ prop : presmb ] ) .",
    "the statement then follows from the following proposition , which shows that the existence of an almost - direct product structure is independent of the choice of section .",
    "let @xmath487 be a split extension of groups .",
