    "silicon photonic systems are gaining momentum but device complexity will again be limited by interconnect technology . out of plane optical interconnect techniques have been proposed @xcite , but these are not compatible with emerging cmos silicon photonics standards which permit only a single silicon optical wave guiding layer @xcite . in - plane crossing structures , which are cmos compatible , have been demonstrated @xcite , but these can introduce losses and may be sensitive to fabrication variations .",
    "long range communications between waveguides through unguided radiation in the silicon slab have been proposed as an alternate interconnect solution @xcite .",
    "this particular approach uses thin , shallow ridge silicon on insulator waveguides which , when operated in the tm mode , can radiate into the te modes of the slab @xcite .",
    "this te radiation is traditionally considered a loss mechanism , however as it is a coherent process , with appropriate control over the radiation it could be utilised as a resource @xcite .",
    "we have previously shown that it is possible to control the radiation direction @xcite and also generate directed , collimated beams @xcite .",
    "the nature of this radiation is quite sensitive to the waveguide geometry and thus may not be robust to fabrication variations .",
    "further , if this radiation is to be used as an interconnect , then the unbound nature of this radiation may lead to undesired interaction with intermediate functional blocks .",
    "adiabatic techniques are well known in photonics , principally being invoked when properties of a single waveguide or two waveguide system are changed slowly , for example with adiabatic tapers @xcite .",
    "slow changes can also be used to effect population transfer between waveguides through a technique called coherent tunnelling adiabatic passage ( ctap ) which is a spatial analogue of the well - known stirap ( stimulated raman adiabatic passage ) protocol in quantum optics @xcite .",
    "ctap was originally proposed for massive particles in tight - binding systems @xcite and then extended to waveguides @xcite .",
    "ctap has the advantage that the transport is extremely robust against fluctuations in the coupling between sites .",
    "ctap also has the surprising feature that the population in the intervening site is greatly suppressed , and in the adiabatic , tight - binding limit , is identically zero .",
    "this unusual behaviour raises the question of whether ctap may be exploited to achieve robust long range coupling between waveguides via unbound radiation , but without exciting this radiation .",
    "here we propose and numerically demonstrate the combination of ctap and lateral leakage to achieve a new type of coupler .",
    "light guided within one waveguide can be transferred over a long distance to another waveguide through use of an unbound lateral leakage state which is coupled to both waveguides . due to the nature of ctap , this coupling is extremely robust , being relatively independent of coupling length and remarkably , the intermediate radiation is not populated during the coupling .",
    "we also show that this technique can be used to bypass an intermediate waveguide without cross - talk .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : section [ section : ctap ] presents a brief over view of the ctap protocol in the context of optical modes and section [ section : lateral leakage ] reviews lateral leakage and shows how coupling between bound waveguides modes and lateral leakage radiation can be controlled .",
