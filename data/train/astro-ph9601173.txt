    "with deep _ rosat _ observations of blank fields , up to @xmath6% of the soft ( @xmath7 ) cosmic x - ray background ( xrb ) has been resolved into individual sources ( e.g. hasinger et  al.1993 ) .",
    "a number of groups have worked / are currently working on identification programs of these _ rosat _ sources and we can expect that we will have the overall picture of the origin of most of the soft ( @xmath8 kev ) x - ray background including contributing source populations and their cosmological evolution . with asca observations of blank fields , the xrb at higher energies ( 2  10 kev ) have also been resolved into sources , although the resolved fraction of the total xrb flux is smaller than that of _ rosat _ because of the limited spatial resolution .",
    "while these observational efforts are rapidly in progress , the unified theory of agns and supporting x - ray observations of agns for the basic framework of the unified scheme have provided insights to the origin of the bulk properties of the xrb . in particular , intrinsic photoelectric absorption observed in the x - ray spectra of seyfert 2 galaxies ( e.g. awaki et  al.1991 ; mulchaey et  al.1992 ) , consistent with the view of the unified scheme that a seyfert 2 galaxy is a seyfert 1 seen at an angle where a torus surrounding the central engine blocks the line of sight . a wide range of absorption column densities",
    "have been observed ( schartel et al .",
    "1995 ) for a hard x - ray flux - limited sample of agns by piccinotti et al .",
    "models of the xrb with evolving populations of unabsorbed and internally - absorbed agns with various absorption column densities , based on the unified scheme of agns have been successfully made consistent with many observational properties of the xrb ( madau et  al.1994 ; comastri et  al.1995 ) .",
    "in particular , they explained the global spectral shape of the xrb , especially the characteristic break at 30 kev and source counts in soft and hard x - rays .",
    "while these models are basically successful , there is still room for major modifications , given current observations .",
    "a recent _ asca _ observation of ngc 3628 by yaqoob et  al.(1995 ) showed that the x - ray ( @xmath9 10 kev ) spectrum of this spiral galaxy , which had previously been classified as a starburst , is rather flat . based on this observation",
    ", they argued that the contribution of low - luminosity extragalactic x - ray sources , like ngc 3628 , to the @xmath10 kev xrb could be significant .",
    "such a low x - ray luminosity population has been deliberately neglected in the madau et  al.(1994 ) and comastri et",
    "al.(1995 ) models .",
    "also these models assumed a simple version of the agn unified scheme where the ratio of the numbers of absorbed and unabsorbed objects does not depend on their intrinsic x - ray luminosity .",
    "however , barcons et  al.(1995 ) argued that this is not likely to be the case but rather the fraction of the unabsorbed agns ( type 1 ) should increase with the intrinsic luminosity .    besides detailed studies of the nature of individual x - ray sources which can contribute to the xrb , statistical properties of the spatial fluctuation of the unresolved background",
    "provide us with other perspectives of cosmic x - ray sources .",
    "fluctuations of the unresolved xrb have been used to infer the @xmath11 relation below the source detection flux - limit ( e.g. shafer 1983 ; hasinger et  al.1993 ; barcons et al . 1994 ) .",
    "the angular auto - correlation function is often used to describe spatial structure of the xrb .",
    "many authors discussed the constraints on the combination of the x - ray volume emissivity and clustering properties of the x - ray sources from the acf ( or upper limits of acf ) ( e.g. danese et  al.1993 ; carrera et  al.1991 ; soltan & hasinger 1994 ) .",
    "while the xrb acf traces the properties of all the x - ray sources along the line of sight and thus the interpretation is highly model dependent , cross - correlating catalogs of known sources with the xrb gives more concrete information on the xrb constituents .",
    "in particular , cross - correlation functions ( ccf ) of unresolved xrb spatial fluctuations with galaxy catalogs give information on the contribution of these galaxies and objects clustered with these sources to the xrb ( jahoda et  al.1991 , 1992 ; lahav et  al.1993 ; miyaji et  al.1994 ; roche et  al.1994 ; barcons et  al.1995 ) .",
    "auto and cross - correlation function analyses over a large region of the sky occasionally discover new components of cosmic x - ray emission .",
    "the auto - correlation of the _ heao-1 _",
    "a2 hard x - ray map nearly over the whole sky at high galactic latitudes revealed a weak large - scale component at @xmath12 , which perhaps is associated with structures in the supergalactic plane ( jahoda 1993 ) . using the _ rosat _ all - sky survey ( rass ) data , soltan et  al.(1995 ) found an extragalactic extended component in the acf of at 1 kev at a scale of 5 degrees .",
    "they also found an angular correlation at 5  10 degree scales in the ccf between the 1 kev xrb and the positions of the abell clusters .",
    "they modeled the latter component as a 10 mpc scale diffuse gas surrounding clusters of galaxies , which itself had not been recognized in any previous observation .",
    "they found , however , that clusters of galaxies , considering this putative circum - cluster emission and clustering of clusters , explain only about a third of their extended 1 kev acf component .",
    "thus the main portion of the extended acf could represent still a new population of cosmic x - ray emission and investigating their nature is only possible by statistical analyses over a large region of the sky .    in this paper ,",
    "we present the results and possible interpretations of a cross - correlation analysis between the soft ( @xmath01 kev ) x - ray sky observed with _ rosat _",
    "pspc all - sky survey and the hard ( 2  15 kev ) x - ray sky observed with the _ heao-1 _",
    "a2 experiment .",
    "the purpose of the correlation between soft - hard x - rays presented in this paper is two - folded .",
    "zero - lag and angular cross - correlation functions ( ccfs ) between surface brightnesses contain information on x - ray sources common to these two bands .",
    "thus this would give additional constraints to the population synthesis models .",
    "especially , it would give a check to the models based on unabsorbed and absorbed agns .",
    "a large area correlation study also may give a clue to the nature of the extended acf component that soltan et  al.(1995 ) found .",
    "the scope of this paper is as follows : in sect.[sec : dat ] , we explain the data used .",
    "we explain the ccf calculation and present the results of the calculation in sect . [",
    "sec : ccf ] .",
    "sect.[sec : form ] presents formulations relating observed ccf with models including individual sources in the population synthesis models and extended components . in sect.[sec : mod ] , we use the formulation to compare various models with the observations .",
    "the purpose of the section is to check the effects of various components on the observed ccf and we do not intend to construct a complete model consistent with all the existing constraints .",
    "such an elaborate modeling would be a topic of a future paper .",
    "finally we conclude our discussion in sect .",

    "the period of short - term enhancements has been excluded and non - cosmic backgrounds ( particle background , solar scattered x - rays and the long - term enhancements ) have been subtracted as explained in snowden et  al.(1995 ) .",
    "soltan et  al.(1995 ) selected a relatively large portion of the high galactic latitude sky which is free from contamination by galactic structures to investigate the extragalactic structures in the soft x - ray sky : @xmath13 we also use this area for our correlation with the hard x - ray sky .",

    "the range of the galactic column in the region is @xmath20 and the conversion factors in that region differ from the mean value by @xmath21 .",
    "therefore we use the average @xmath22 value for the whole region for the analysis .",
    "we have used the all - sky hard x - ray map constructed from the combination of the hed3 and med detectors of the _ heao-1 _",

    "these give a fair estimate of the uncertainties of the correlation function .      in order to evaluate the contribution to the ccf from bright _ rosat _ sources , we have made a list of bright sources by performing a source detection procedure to the r6 map in the region defined in eq.([eq : rosreg ] ) .",
    "the source detection has been made to the map gridded in @xmath41 pixels , larger than the _ rosat _ pspc point spread function , and thus is much less sensitive than the source detection procedure directly applied to the full - resolution _ rosat _ all - sky survey data .",

    "we use the coarsely rebinned map to obtain a complete r6 flux - limited sample of bright sources .",
    "as described by hasinger et  al.(1993 ) , the source detection have been made in two steps : the first step is to slide a detection cell over the map and find excess over the region immediately surrounding the cell ( ldetect ) .",
    "a background map was created by removing the sources detected in the ldetect procedure , filling the holes by the mean counts surrounding them , and making a bi - cubic spline fit to the filled map .",
    "this procedure gives a more robust measure of the backgound for the source detection than taking the background from immediate surroundings .",
    "then we slid the detection cell again to the original map to find significant excess counts over the background map created in the above process ( mdetect ) .",

    "the size of the detection cell has been taken to be 3@xmath143 cells @xmath42 and the source detection threshold is set at a significance of @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the probability that the random poisson fluctuation make the excess counts in the cell .",
    "this roughly corresponds to a 4@xmath45 excess of a gaussian fluctuation . since the _ rosat _ pspc psf and extents of clusters of galaxies ( except for closest ones , which have been excluded from the analysis ( sect .",
    "[ sec : exc ] ) are much smaller than the size of the detection cell , the source list from the mdetect procedure is expected to be free from significant biases .    in the least sensitive areas , the detection limit was 0.08 r6 cts s@xmath16 .",

    "the comastri et al .",

    "the contribution of this population to our correlation calculated using above assumptions is only @xmath163 for either t2 or t3 .",

    "thus this estimate is insensitive to the detailed behavior of the cosmological evolution .",
    "the above estimation shows that the low x - ray luminosity galaxies can not explain the observed excess correlation in t2 or h2 .",

    "they speculated that this component could be due to the clustering of groups of galaxies .",

    "@xmath166 from the clusterings of agn and clusters used in model p1 using eq .",
    "[ eq : wshc ] ( in this case , two bands in the expression are the same ) are two orders of magnitude smaller than the actual values observed by soltan et al .",
    "we also checked if the agn and cluster clusterings can explain the excess correlation in our zero - lag ccfs ( t2 and h2 ) .",
    "the expected clustering effects to the _ rosat _  heao-1 zero - lag ccfs ( because of the beam smearing , the zero - lag values are mainly due to the clustering at a scale of 1@xmath33 ) for the same model are also two orders of magnitude smaller than the observed excesses . for these estimates , we have assumed a form @xmath167 for @xmath168 and @xmath169 for @xmath170 .",

    "the expected correlation is insensitive to the cosmological evolution of clustering and we have used @xmath172 . since the discrepancies are two orders of magnitude , we also expect that the clustering of low x - ray luminosity objects ( galaxies , low - luminosity agns ) , which have not been considered in the above calculation , can not make much contribution , since their 2  10 kev x - ray volume emissivity should be lower than that of agns ( miyaji et al .",
    "thus we expect that the soltan et al.s extended acf component truely represents a new population of x - ray structure .",

    "we constrain the nature of this component by comparing the upper - limit to our @xmath173 ccf with their acf and also investigate the contribution of this component to our zero - lag ccf . since the spatial resolution of their acf measurement is much higher than our ccf measurement , we have smoothed their acf with the beam of our ccf ( see eq . [ [ eq : etac ] ] ) and compared it with our ccf . the smallest angle where there is no overlap of the beams is at @xmath174 . at this angle ,",
    "the smoothed acf value is @xmath175 , while the 2@xmath45 upper - limit of our ccf ( t2 ) is @xmath176 . assuming that the detected r6 acf is dominated by a single component with a single spectrum , the hard - to - soft flux ratio @xmath177 of this component is : @xmath178 the upper limit to this ratio is 1.3 ( tot cts s@xmath16 ) ( r6 cts s@xmath16)@xmath16 .",
    "this corresponds to a raymond & smith plasma with @xmath179 kev or a power - law photon index of @xmath180 for a galactic column density of @xmath181 .",
    "assuming that the structure causing the extragalactic 1 kev ( r6 ) acf in soltan et  al.(1995 ) in the ( @xmath182 ) comes from a single extended component , we have calculated the expected zero - lag r6-a2 ccf ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "these values are shown under the models e1 ( assuming a @xmath133 2 kev raymond - smith spectrum ) and e2 ( @xmath133 1 kev ) ( e represents the extended ) .",
    "a heavy metal abundance of 0.4 ( cosmic ) has been used in these estimations . since the _ rosat _ r6 ( 1 kev ) band is dominated by the fe l emission lines , this estimate is sensitive to the heavy element abundance and",
    "should be taken as a rough measure .",
    "figure [ fig : wth_m ] shows the comparisons of the observed and modeled angular ccf for the source - removed cases .",
    "the models shown are e1 and e2 in addition to p1 as labeled . as we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : wth_m ] , model ( p1+e1 ) could explain the zero - lag amplitude of the ccfs .",
    "this means that if the extended component in the r6 acf is a thermal plasma with @xmath4 kev this would also explain the excess zero - lag ccf over the model p1 prediction in our source - removed ccfs within 2@xmath45 .",
    "considering that the h2 zero - lag correlation still exceeds the model p1+e1 , while statistical significance is poor , a flatter spectrum in the @xmath154 kev range for this component is preferred .",
    "it is possible that the r6 acf signal soltan et al .",
    "( 1995 ) found is composed of more than one component .",
    "for example , a composite model with a small - scale ( @xmath183 ) hard component and a large - scale ( @xmath184 ) soft component would better explain the data .",
    "as we see from the analysis presented above , agns and clusters account well for the correlation between the _ rosat _ bright r6 sources ( @xmath185 r6 cts s@xmath16 , corresponds to @xmath186 ) and the _ heao-1",
    "_ a2 surface brightness .",
    "this correlation is dominated by the poisson effect from individual clusters of galaxies in the local universe . on the other hand , the correlations between the residual r6 background and the _ heao-1 _",
    "1 a2 surface brightnesses are about a factor of 3  4 larger than the poisson effect expected from the population synthesis model by comastri et  al.and clusters of galaxies based on the known x - ray luminosity functions .",
    "we have considered a few possible components which have not been considered in the population synthesis model , i.e. , agn - group association , unabsorbed ( scattered ) soft component in type 2 agns , and low - luminosity x - ray galaxies .",
    "any of these three are not likely to explain the observed excess correlation .    due to the large collimator beam of the _ heao-1 _",
    "a2 experiment , the zero - lag correlation could also be contributed by the clustering effect or an extended component .",
    "the extragalactic 1 kev ( r6 ) angular auto - correlation function ( acf ) by soltan et al .",
    "( 1995 ) clearly shows an extended structure up to a separation of several degrees .",
    "the origin of this component is not clear at this moment .",
    "they showed that the effects of rich clusters including the cluster - cluster clustering and the putative @xmath187 mpc - scale diffuse gas component in their model to explain the abell cluster  1 kev cross - correlation function only amounts to about one third of the r6 acf signal .",
    "they suggested diffuse emission from groups of galaxies could possibly contribute to the r6 acf .",
    "however , statistical properties concerning poor groups , e.g. luminosity / temperature functions and clustering properties with rich clusters / agns , are scarcely known . comparing the 1 kev acf with the upper - limit to our r6 ",
    "a2 ( tot ) ccf at @xmath188 , the minimum angular separation where beams do not overlap , we have constrained the spectrum of the extended structure causing this r6 acf signal .",
    "this corresponds to a raymond & smith plasma of @xmath189 kev or a power - law photon index of @xmath190 .",
    "suppose the component responsible for the 1 kev acf has a spectrum with an equivalent color - temperature of @xmath191 2 kev , this component explains the correlation in excess of the population synthesis model expectation , assuming that the extended r6 acf structure is composed of a single component .",
    "a picture where there are a harder small - scale component and a softer large - scale component would better explain the data .",
    "there remains also a possibility that some major change to the comastri et  al.population synthesis model or an introduction of a new population is needed , while the extended component has a lower temperature ( or a steeper spectrum ) .",
    "the current observation can not discriminate between these two , since it is limited by the low spatial resolution of the _ heao-1 _ a2 experiment . a large area survey at @xmath154 kev with higher spatial resolution in a future mission such as _ abrixas _ ( friedrich et al . 1996 )",
    "would enable us to discriminate between these two pictures . with an analysis similar to that presented here , but with a higher spatial resolution , we can constrain the spectrum of the extended component and give another crucial observational constraint to the population synthesis models simultaneously .",
