    "within the front form dynamics@xcite , where the state of the system is defined at @xmath0 , if one uses the impulse approximation of the plus component of the electromagnetic current ( @xmath1 ) in the drell - yan frame to calculate the form factors , the pair production from the incoming photon ( pair - term contribution ) is in general suppressed by light - front momentum conservation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this was seen in schematic covariant models for spin - zero composite systems @xcite .",
    "however , even in the drell - yan frame the pair term is present in @xmath1 for spin - one systems and is necessary to keep the rotational properties of the matrix element of the current@xcite .    to avoid the difficulties associated with the rotational properties of the impulse approximation some physically motivated schemes to extract form factors from the current were used@xcite . in another approach , free of these ambiguities@xcite ,",
    "the plus component of the momentum transfer is non zero while the transverse momentum transfer vanishes in the breit frame .",
    "this can be achieved by departing from the drell - yan condition by rotating the system around the @xmath2-direction , i.e , a non - kinematical transformation , and thus changing the direction of the momentum transfer in the @xmath3 plane .",
    "however , by relaxing the drell - yan condition , a light - front pair term can contribute to the plus component of the current , which can be studied in the pion example , as a prototype of a relativistic system of bound constituents . in this work ,",
    "the composite system of a constituent quark and antiquark , is described by an ansatz for the bethe - salpeter amplitude which is nonconstant and symmetric with a pseudo scalar coupling of the constituent to the pion field .",
    "our aim here is to discuss , within that model , the magnitude of the pair contribution to the pion electromagnetic form factor for momentum transfers in the @xmath4 plane in the breit - frame , as has been done in ref.@xcite .",
    "the work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present the model of the pion bethe - salpeter amplitude and its eletromagnetic current in impulse approximation . in sec .",

    "the electromagnetic current of the pion is calculated in impulse approximation , using a pseudoscalar coupling between pion and quark fields , given by the effective lagrangian ( see , e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the coupling constant from the goldberg - treiman relation at the quark level , and @xmath7 is the mass of the constituents and @xmath8 the pion decay constant .",
    "the electromagnetic current of @xmath9 in impulse approximation is build from the covariant expression , which correspond to the feynman triangle diagram ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath10\\ ,   \\label{jmu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the number of colors , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the initial and final momenta of the system , @xmath15 is the momentum transfer and @xmath16 the spectator quark momentum .",
    "the factor 2 stems from isospin algebra .",
    "our ansatz for the analytical form of the vertex function describing the momentum part of the coupling between the constituents and pion is : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the regulator parameter . by imposing the charge normalization condition @xmath19 , the constant @xmath20",
    "this model satisfies current conservation @xmath21@xcite .",
    "we consider breit frames , with the momentum transfer @xmath22 and using the light - front variables , i.e. @xmath23 , one has @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the drell - yan frame with @xmath26 is recovered for @xmath27 , while the @xmath28 condition @xcite comes with @xmath29 .",
    "( the angle @xmath30 of ref.@xcite corresponds to @xmath31 ) .",
    "the pion electromagnetic form factor is extracted from the general covariant expression : @xmath32 evaluating the plus component of the current in eq.([jmu ] ) , which has two non vanishing contributions : @xcite : @xmath33 the integration over the interval of @xmath34 defines @xmath35 ( see fig .",

    "this second term contributes to both @xmath50 and @xmath51 , due to the analytic structure of the symmetric vertex function of eq .",

    "also , the factors containing gamma matrices in the numerator and the phase space factors @xmath36 and @xmath54 appearing in the denominator are left out@xcite , and then one gets : @xmath55 \\frac{p^+}{m^2_\\pi - m^2_{0 } } \\ . \\label{wf2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 , is a normalization factor and @xmath57 , with @xmath58 ; @xmath59 and the square of the free mass is @xmath60 .",
    "the light - front wave function , eq.([wf2 ] ) , is symmetric by the interchange of quark and antiquark momenta , therefore it is not plagued by the conceptual difficulties associated with the use of the nonsymmetric regulator @xcite .",

    "in this model , we have two free parameters : the constituent quark mass @xmath7 , which is chosen as 0.220 gev @xcite and the regulator mass , @xmath18 , found to be 0.6 gev from the fit of the experimental value @xmath70 mev . the pion mass used is 0.140 gev . with these parameters , the charge radius from @xmath71 ,",
    "comes out to be 0.74 fm , which is about @xmath72 larger than the experimental value ( @xmath73 fm @xcite ) .",
    "the probability of the @xmath74 fock - state component in the pion in the model is calculated to be @xmath75 , differently from the nonsymmetric regulator model of ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath76 .",
    "we note that , in a previous work@xcite it was necessary a probability around 0.5 - 0.75 of the valence wave function to fit the data on deep inelastic scattering .     for @xmath29 .",

    "2 , the results for the pion form factor are shown and compared to the experimental data .",
    "the full - model calculations , eq .",
    "( [ ffactor ] ) , nicely agree with the new data for the pion form factor @xcite .",
    "therefore , our symmetric vertex model can reproduce the form factor data consistently with the experimental value of @xmath8 , while for the nonsymmetric regulator this was not achieved@xcite .",
    "we observe that the model reproduces simultaneously @xmath8 and the experimental form factor for constituent quark mass in the range between 0.2 and 0.3 gev .",
    "the separate contributions to the pion form factor , @xmath80 and @xmath81 for @xmath29 , are shown in fig .",
    "2 . differently from the case",
    "@xmath82 , the form factor is dominated by the pair production process for @xmath29 , except near @xmath83 . also , we observe that the form factor is completely dominated by the pair - term contribution at high values of the momentum transfer , which appears to be fairly model independent as well@xcite .      the contributions of the instantaneous part of the dirac propagator to @xmath39 and @xmath38 , called @xmath78 and @xmath87 , respectively , are also shown in fig . 2 for @xmath29 .",
    "the value of @xmath88 is nonzero because of the specific analytic structure of the vertex function@xcite .",
    "we also observe that @xmath86 dominates @xmath89 at higher momentum transfers .",
    "one can understand this by looking at the diagram of fig .",
    "1(b ) , where in principle the spectator quark can be exchanged between the incoming and outgoing pion at a given instant @xmath90 , while the quark - antiquark pair has been produced by the virtual photon at an earlier stage . as the magnitude of the momentum @xmath91 increases , the time fluctuation for the virtual process decreases and favors the instantaneous exchange of the spectator quark between the initial and final pion , which finally explains the dominance of @xmath86 in the pion form factor . in fig .",
    "3 , the results for the various contributions to the pion form factor for @xmath92 ( gev / c)@xmath85 as a function of the angle @xmath93 are shown . for increasing angles , the form factor changes smoothly from valence to pair - term or nonvalence dominance .    in summary",
    ", we verified that the new data for the pion electromagnetic form factor@xcite is satisfactory described by our symmetric ansatz of the vertex function when the experimental value of @xmath94 is fitted and the constituent quark mass is chosen in the range between 0.2 and 0.3 gev .",
    "we performed a detailed analysis of the contribution of the light - front pair - term to the form factor for different momentum transfer directions in the breit frame .",
    "such contribution is unique and does not depend on the particular choice of bethe - salpeter vertex , as long as the four - dimensional impulse approximation is used to calculate the electromagnetic current .",
    "another interesting outcome of our symmetric model is that the probability of the pion valence component , @xmath63 , is about 0.77 ) , at variance with previous covariant calculations where @xmath95@xcite .",
