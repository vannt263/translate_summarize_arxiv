    "nuclear spin polarization is a necessary condition for many types of physics experiments including studies of nuclear structure , nuclear reactions , fundamental interactions , and condensed matter physics .",
    "many of these experiments require the polarization of radioactive ion beams ( ribs ) .",
    "for example , ground state nuclear magnetic dipole ( @xmath1 ) and electric quadrupole moments ( @xmath2 ) are critical in the study of nuclear structure , especially as one moves away from the valley of stability .",
    "currently , the best reach for such measurements has been demonstrated by ribs polarized in fragmentation reactions .    quenched magnetic moment values are observed for the extremely neutron - deficient nuclei @xmath3c and @xmath4cu .",
    "the small @xmath1 value of the proton drip line nucleus @xmath3c ( @xmath5=1.3 mev ) leads to a large deviation of the deduced isoscaler expectation value @xmath6 for the @xmath3li-@xmath3c mirror pair when compared to observed trends for @xmath7 nuclei @xcite .",
    "shell model calculations were shown to better reproduce @xmath6 when isospin mixing was included @xcite .",

    "@xmath4cu represents the heaviest @xmath8 nuclide with a known @xmath1 value .",
    "the magnetic moment is smaller than predicted in shell model calculations that assume @xmath9ni is a good doubly - magic nucleus @xcite .",
    "the quadrupole moments of the b isotopes also provide evidence for changes in nuclear structure .",
    "@xmath10 was found to be twice as large as expected from shell model calculations @xcite .",
    "the larger @xmath2 was considered evidence of a proton halo covering a neutron core . near the neutron drip line",
    ", the experimental @xmath2 moments for odd - mass @xmath11b , @xmath12b , and @xmath13b were found to be nearly constant , independent of neutron number @xcite .",

    "the result reveals that both proton and neutron quadrupole polarization charges may be reduced near the neutron drip line @xcite .    from these examples",
    ", it is apparent that moment measurements play an important role in nuclear structure studies . as stated earlier , in order to perform any moment measurement , the nuclei must be spin polarized .",
    "there is a strong dependence of polarization on the momentum of the fragment nucleus , therefore , it is crucial to know the magnitude of polarization prior to the experiment . while fragmentation reactions are key in producing exotic nuclei , these nuclei come with low rates .",

    "fragments detected at small angles with respect to the normal beam axis were shown to have a polarized spin in the low - intensity wings of the momentum distribution .",

    "<S> intermediate - energy heavy - ion collisions can produce a spin polarization of the projectile - like species . </S>",
    "<S> spin polarization has been observed for both nucleon removal and nucleon pickup processes . </S>",
    "<S> qualitative agreement with measured spin polarization as a function of the momentum of the projectile - like fragment is found in a kinematical model that considers conservation of linear and angular momentum and assumes peripheral interactions between the fast projectile and target . </S>",
    "<S> better quantitative agreement was reached by including more realistic angular distributions , de - orientation caused by @xmath0-ray emission , and by correcting for the out - of - plane acceptance . </S>",
    "<S> the newly introduced corrections were found to apply to both nucleon removal and nucleon pickup processes . </S>"
