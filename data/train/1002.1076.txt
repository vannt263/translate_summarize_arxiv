    "one main objective of the _ integral _ hard x  ray satellite is the regular survey of the whole sky at high energies ( above 20 kev ) .",
    "this makes use of the unique imaging capabilities of the ibis instrument@xcite which permits the detection of sources at the mcrab level with a typical localization accuracy of 2 - 3 arcmin above 20 kev .",
    "a substantial fraction of the remaining objects ( @xmath130% ; see e.g. ref .  )",
    "had no obvious counterpart at other wavelengths and therefore can not be associated with any known class of high - energy emitting sources .",
    "to this aim , since 2004 our group has been actively performing a successful observational campaign for the optical identification of these unidentified objects : up to now we identified more than 100 _ integral _ sources and found that about half of them are active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , mostly located in the nearby universe ( at redshift @xmath2 0.1 ; see ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "here we present the continuation of this work with the use of the new _ integral _ detections of unidentified sources reported in the recently published 4@xmath0 ibis survey.@xcite",
    "using the criterion applied to our past works ( see e.g. ref .  ) , we positionally cross - correlated the 208 unidentified objects belonging to the 4@xmath0 ibis survey@xcite with x  ray ( _ rosat _ , _ xmm - newton _ ) , radio ( nvss , sumss , mgps ) and far - infrared ( iras ) catalogues ",
    "available online using simbad  and with archival x ",
    "ray observations ( _ swift _ , _ chandra _ ) .",
    "this was made in order to reduce the source error circle and pinpoint the putative optical counterpart .",
    "a few cases in which a catalogued emission - line optical object is present in the ibis error box were also considered .",
    "we also included in our sample the source igr j01054@xmath37253 , not included in the 4@xmath0 ibis survey but recently discovered during an _ integral _ key programme observation,@xcite and for which an arcsec - sized x  ray position obtained with _ swift",
    "_ is available in the literature.@xcite    this allowed us to pick out , and perform optical spectroscopy on , 25 candidate counterparts .",
    "the list of selected objects is reported in the 1st column of table 1 .",
    "while it is known@xcite that the presence of a single , bright soft x  ray object within the ibis error circle indicates that it is with a high probability the lower - energy counterpart of the corresponding _ integral _ source , the same can not be said for radio and far - infrared sources , or for optically peculiar objects .",
    "thus , for the ibis sources which were selected using catalogues at wavelengths longer than soft x  rays , we caution the reader that the association with the selected optical object should await confirmation via a pointed observation with a soft x - ray satellite such as _ xmm - newtom _ , _ chandra _ or _",
    "swift_. to stress this issue , when needed , we put an asterisk beside the source name in table 1 .",
    "in this work , 6 telescopes located in northern and southern hemisphere observatories were used ; moreover , spectra from the 6df@xcite and sdss@xcite on - line archives were also employed . in the following ,",
    "the list of the telescopes used for the classification reported in table 1 is given :    1.5 m telescope at ctio , chile ;    1.5 m `` cassini '' telescope in loiano , italy ;    1.8 m `` copernico '' telescope in asiago , italy ;    1.9 m `` radcliffe '' telescope at saao , south africa ;    2.1 m telescope in san pedro mrtir , mexico ;    2.5 m telescope at apache point observatory , new mexico , usa , for the sdss spectra ;    3.58 m ntt telescope at eso - la silla , chile ;    3.9 m aat telescope of the anglo - australian observatory in siding spring , australia , for the 6df spectra .",
    "table 1 reports , for each selected object , the corresponding classification obtained through optical spectroscopy , the object redshift and the name of the telescope used for the identification ; fig . 1 reports the spectra of the optical counterparts of some of these 25 selected ibis sources .    as one",
    "can see from table 1 , most objects ( 17 , i.e. , 68% ) have an extragalactic origin , and are nearly equally divided into type 1 and type 2 agns ( 9 and 8 cases , respectively ) .",
    "six of them ( 5 of type 1 and only 1 of type 2 ) have @xmath4  0.1 , indicating that this new , deeper ibis survey is able to detect more distant agns .",
    "only 32% ( 8 sources ) of our identifications are instead of galactic nature .",
    "interestingly , half of them are ( likely magnetic ) cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) : these identifications increase by 13% the number of hard x - ray emitting cvs detected with _",
    "integral _ up to now ( see ref .  ) .",
    "we here presented the identification of a first set of 25 sources of unknown or uncertain nature , 24 of which belonging to the 4@xmath0 ibis survey .",
    "we found that 2/3 of them have an extragalactic nature , with redshifts in the range 0.0190.606 , while the remaining ones are galactic sources .",
    "it is noteworthy that the majority of the latter ones are ( possibly magnetic ) cvs .",
    "these preliminary results further confirm the _ integral _ capabilities of detecting agns and hard x - ray emitting cvs .",
    "we also stress that with this work we already reduced by 12% the number of unidentified sources of the 4@xmath0 ibis survey , bringing it from 208 to 184 .",
    "this research has made use of the simbad database operated at cds , strasbourg , france , of the nasa / gsfc s heasarc archive , and of the hyperleda catalogue operated at the observatoire de lyon , france .",
