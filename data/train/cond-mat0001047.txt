    "the discovery that some alkali - doped c@xmath3 compounds are superconducting @xcite with a transition temperature as high as 40 k for the fulleride c@xmath3cs@xmath4 under pressure @xcite has triggered considerable interest in the study of fulleride doped materials at low temperatures .",
    "much effort has been concentrated in trying to understand whether such large values of @xmath8 can be caused by the coupling of electrons to phonons .",
    "the electron - phonon coupling constants for c@xmath3 have been estimated both from experiments @xcite and calculations @xcite .",
    "there exists some consensus on the fact that c@xmath3 compounds are @xmath9wave bcs - like superconductors driven by the coupling to selected intramolecular phonons @xcite . on the other hand , no calculation of this",
    "coupling exists in the literature for the case of c@xmath0 .",
    "since the associated alkali compounds display no superconductivity , with a smooth and continuous behavior of the resistivity down to about 1 k  @xcite , it is an important issue to compare the electron - phonon coupling constant for c@xmath0 with those of c@xmath3 .    in the present paper",
    "we address this problem from a theoretical point of view , computing the deformation potential of c@xmath0 and extracting the associated total electron ",
    "phonon coupling constant , @xmath10 .",
    "it will be concluded that the resulting value of @xmath10 is much smaller than in c@xmath3 , essentially ruling out the possibility of a superconducting phase at low temperatures for doped fullerides built out of c@xmath0 .",
    "this negative result , which can be understood in rather general , qualitative structural terms , as well discussed at the end of sec .",
    "iii , has two positive oucomes : first , it provides further evidence for the @xmath9wave bcs - like mechanism at the basis of alkali - doped fullerides superconductivity .",
    "second , it sheds light on the properties fullerenes have to exhibit to be `` good '' building blocks of eventual organic superconductors , indicating the direction of the highly symmetric , small fullerenes ( cf . also refs .",
    "@xcite ) , a strategy which seems to be universally valid also for other compact systems , like the atomic nucleus  @xcite .    in the production of fullerene clusters by means of laser vaporization or arc discharge",
    "the yield of c@xmath0 can be optimized , by varying the experimental conditions  @xcite , up to a ratio of about 10% of c@xmath0 with respect to c@xmath3 .",
    "this allows the production of sufficiently large amounts of c@xmath0 for the synthesis of c@xmath0 molecular crystals  @xcite .",
    "hence , the structural and electronic properties of c@xmath0 can be experimentally studied , and compared with those of c@xmath3 . in analogy with the case of solid c@xmath3",
    ", c@xmath0 crystals can be doped with alkali metals , and the conductivity of the resulting compounds can be investigated .    on the theoretical side , _ ab - initio _ methods based on the local density approximation ( lda )  @xcite",
    "have been applied to the study of the ground - state properties of c@xmath0 .",
    "the ionic configuration , characterized by a d@xmath11 geometry , is consistent with the nmr measurements  @xcite , and the electronic structure agrees reasonably well with ups data .",
    "we adopt in this work the ground - state geometry of ref .",
    "the vibrational properties of c@xmath0 have been studied in  @xcite , starting with the same geometry .",
    "a simplified model like the bond charge model ( bcm ) is nevertheless able to reproduce the experimental values for the optically active frequencies within 4%  @xcite .",
    "indeed , beyond the electronic and vibrational properties , _ ab  initio _ methods also allow to compute the coupling between these two degrees of freedom without the need of introducing any adjustable parameter . however , _ ab - initio _ methods in the case of large clusters , such as c@xmath3 and c@xmath0 , are computationally demanding and may not be particularly transparent . as an alternative , in order to extract the electron - phonon coupling constants , it is possible to adopt a simplified numerical method which already proved to be satisfactory in the case of c@xmath3  @xcite .",
    "this method , albeit approximated , has been shown to lead to quite satisfactory results , also because it is devised to take into account accurate phonon eigenvectors , which are known to influence very strongly the matrix elements of the deformation potential .",
    "in fact , the relative strength of the latter is strictly related to the bond stretching associated to the ionic displacements . in the present work , using the scheme introduced in ref.@xcite for c@xmath3 , we address the case of c@xmath0 .",
    "our calculation starts with the determination of the electronic states of fullerene - c@xmath0 , and the corresponding electron density , within dft - lda .",
    "we include the exchange and correlation effects according to the parametrization of perdew and zunger  @xcite of the monte - carlo results of ceperley and alder  @xcite .",
    "no gga corrections are considered , since lda is known to yield very accurate results for the equilibrium geometry and charge density in such covalently bonded carbon sistems  @xcite .",
    "the role of carbon atoms is taken into account using _ ab - initio _ norm - conserving pseudopotentials @xcite .",
    "a spherical basis , made up with states which are solution of a central potential which mimics the @xmath12=0 component of the lda local potential , is employed .",
    "spherical wavefunctions with @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively up to 15 and 20 are included in the basis ( this gives @xmath15 4000 basis vectors ) .",
    "the kohn - sham equations are solved in matrix form on this basis , as described in more detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that work",
    "the maximum values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 were slightly different , but the results are essentially the same .",
    "the homo - lumo gap is 1.87 ev , in agreement with other lda calculations  @xcite . as in c@xmath3",
    ", errors due to the neglect of both self - energy and excitonic effects nearly cancel each other , leading to a theoretical value close to the experimentally measured optical gap ( 1.6@xmath160.2 ev ) .",
    "the kohn - sham levels up to about -10 ev are in overall agreement with the ups spectra .",
    "the symmetries of the homo and lumo levels ( @xmath17 ) are the same as those obtained in  @xcite .",
    "the different results of ref .",
    "@xcite are probably an artifact due to the limited basis set used there .",
    "the energies and eigenvectors of the vibrational normal modes have been taken from a bcm calculation  @xcite .",
    "then , following  @xcite , we have parametrized the _ ab - initio _ electronic density in terms of @xmath1 hybrid orbitals obtained as linear combinations of the four @xmath18 and @xmath19 valence orbitals of each carbon atom .",
    "three of the hybrid orbitals are directed along the bonds connecting the atom with its three nearest neighbors , while the fourth is determined by orthogonality conditions and takes care of the additional @xmath20-bonding present in the fullerenic cages .",
    "the radial wave functions of the @xmath18 and @xmath19 orbitals are taken as standard slater wave functions ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) , where the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 have been adjusted in order to obtain the best fit to the c@xmath0 charge density computed in lda .",
    "this leads to @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( to be compared with similar values obtained in the case of c@xmath3  @xcite ) . for comparison ,",
    "the atomic values are @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "after having determined the hybrid orbitals , we can write the contribution to the total electronic density arising from a single atom , and carry out a multipole expansion of it around the center of the cluster . adding the contributions of the 70 atoms one obtains the total density .",
    "the deformation potential associated with a normal mode @xmath29 is then @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the displacement of the @xmath32-th ion , @xmath33 is the total lda electronic potential , and @xmath34 represents the whole set of ionic coordinates whose equilibrium values are @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the pseudopotential term of @xmath33 displays an explicit dependence on the ionic positions , therefore the calculation of its gradient presents no difficulties .",
    "on the other hand , the hartree and exchange - correlation ( xc ) terms depend on @xmath37 _ implicitly _ through the electronic density @xmath38 .",
    "we thus write @xmath39 = \\sum_{n } \\frac{\\partial v_{\\rm hartree , xc }   [ \\varrho]}{\\partial \\varrho } \\vec q_n \\cdot \\vec \\nabla_n\\     \\varrho(\\vec r,\\{\\vec r\\ } ) .",
    "\\label{dercomp}\\ ] ] one can easily calculate @xmath40 , while the gradient of the total density is determined by assuming , within the present hybrid orbital model , that upon moving the ions according to the phonon eigenvectors the hybrid orbitals change their direction but _ not _ their shape .",
    "this makes the calculation quite simple and transparent , since it is possible to visualize the effect of a normal ionic displacement on the electronic orbitals .",
    "finally , we can evaluate the matrix elements of the deformation potential , @xmath41_{ij } \\equiv \\langle i | v_{def}^{(\\alpha ) } | j \\rangle$ ] , between kohn - sham wavefunctions .",
    "if we are interested in the behavior of the conductivity in alkali - doped fullerites , or in the photoemission spectrum of c@xmath0 , we should start from phonon energies , and deformation potentials , evaluated by using the electronic density of a negative charged ion . on the other hand , because the density of the 280 valence electrons of c@xmath0 is not appreciably altered by adding a few more electrons , one expects the matrix elements of the deformation potentials associated with c@xmath0 and with c@xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) , to be rather similar .",
    "we evaluate , for each phonon @xmath29 , the _ reduced _ matrix elements @xmath41_{ii}$ ] ( corresponding to a given electronic state @xmath44 ) which are denoted by @xmath45 , as well as the partial electron - phonon coupling constants @xmath46 defined as @xmath47 in the above expression , @xmath48 is the density of levels at the fermi energy , @xmath49 are the phonon frequencies , and @xmath50 is @xmath51 , @xmath52 being the degeneracy of the phonon state  @xcite .",
    "the results corresponding to the lumo ( @xmath17 ) and the @xmath53 and @xmath54 phonons , are collected in table i. we only report those phonons yielding a non ",
    "negligible partial coupling , i.e. , @xmath55 mev . for these phonons",
    ", we also show the value of the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the raman peaks ( @xmath56 ) , due to the decay to electron ",
    "hole pairs , widths which are connected to the partial couplings by the relation @xcite    @xmath57    these widths show up as additional broadenings of the raman peaks when the lumo electronic state becomes occupied , e.g. , in the case of k@xmath5c@xmath0 .",
    "the differences between the widths of the raman peaks of k@xmath5c@xmath0 and those of the peaks of bare c@xmath0 films have been measured  @xcite , and are reported in the last column of table i. however , a direct comparison with the theoretical results displayed in the fifth column of table i is not straightforward for several reasons .",
    "first of all , it must be observed that subtracting the phonon widths measured in pure c@xmath0 from that measured in k@xmath58c@xmath0 leads , in some cases , to unrealistic negative values .",
    "then , one should be aware of the fact that the frequencies and symmetry assignements of the experimental peaks are affected by some uncertainty . in any case , we followed the assignements given in refs . @xcite and @xcite , which are different from those of ref .",
    "@xcite , since the former refer to low  temperature , higher resolution spectra , and rely also on calculations of the phonon peaks strength  @xcite .",
    "finally , the value of @xmath48 is not known with a high accuracy : we assume a value of 12 ev@xmath59 as suggested by ref .",
    "@xcite , but any value within the range 630 ev@xmath59 seems to be equally possible @xcite .",
    "the total electron ",
    "phonon coupling constant @xmath10 ( sum of the partial coupling constants ) computed making use of the results reported in the fifth column of table i , and of the empirical values of @xmath56 ( seventh column of table i ) , are quite similar and of the order of 0.1 . keeping in mind the above  mentioned caveats , we may hence speak of an overall agreement between the results of the present calculation and the experimental findings .",
    "if @xmath48 varies between @xmath60 and @xmath61 ev@xmath59 , the theoretical total coupling constant varies between @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "these values must be compared with a value essentially equal to 1 obtained in the case of c@xmath3 ( cf .",
    ", e.g. ,  @xcite and @xcite , as well as references therein ) .    in a system where superconductivity is associated with the electron - phonon coupling , the transition temperature @xmath8 can be calculated making use of mcmillan s solution of the eliashberg equation  @xcite @xmath64 ,   \\label{tc}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is a typical ( logarithmic averaged ) phonon frequency , and @xmath66 the coulomb pseudopotential @xcite .",
    "while the above expression leads to @xmath67 10 - 15 k for c@xmath3 , making use of typical values @xmath680.2 - 0.3 , it predicts a vanishing value for c@xmath0 , even allowing for uncertainties of the order of 50 to 100 @xmath69 in the estimated value of @xmath10 .",
    "this result testifies to the fact that the transport properties in fullerites are not simply dictated by the general features common to all these systems .",
    "going from c@xmath3 to c@xmath0 , deformation plays a very important role with respect to the electron - phonon interaction , by breaking the symmetries of electronic and vibrational levels , and by weakening their coupling .",
    "in fact , in order to better understand the origin of the large reduction of the coupling strength in going from c@xmath3 to c@xmath0 , we have analyzed , for both clusters , the phonon eigenvectors of the low  frequency modes which couple to the electronic lumo state , and compared them with the spatial localization of the latter .    in the low ",
    "frequency region , as illustrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is possible to recognize , with no ambiguity , the relation between a group of slightly splitted vibrational modes of c@xmath0 and the corresponding quintuplet of an @xmath70 mode of c@xmath3 .",
    "this can be done by classifying the modes of both clusters according to the largest common symmetry subgroup , @xmath71 .",
    "we focus on the @xmath72 mode of c@xmath3 at 408 cm@xmath59 , which is associated with one of the largest @xmath74 .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we can trace the five modes associated with the @xmath72 vibration of c@xmath3 to the @xmath75,@xmath76 and @xmath77 modes of c@xmath0 at 425 , 415 and 442 cm@xmath59 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath76 mode does not couple with the lumo of c@xmath0 , hence about 2/5 of the coupling strength is lost .",
    "the remaining modes are associated with a higher @xmath78 with respect to the case of c@xmath3 , further reducing the coupling .",
    "finally , a large reduction effect comes from the different spatial localization of the lumo wave functions in c@xmath3 and c@xmath0 .",
    "in particular , we have explicitly verified that the shape of the molecular deformation associated with the above mentioned normal modes is quite similar in the two clusters  @xcite . however , in the case of c@xmath3 the lumo wave function is concentrated in the neighborhood of the bonds which undergo the largest stretching while in c@xmath0 , the lumo wave function is distributed on a larger region .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "1 the stereographic projection of c@xmath3 lumo wave function on a spherical surface with radius 3.4 @xmath79 , while in fig .",
    "2 a similar projection - but on an ellipsoidal surface whose radii are 3.55 @xmath79 and 4.20 @xmath79 - is presented for the case of the lumo wave function of c@xmath0 . in both figures ,",
    "the thick continous lines mark the bonds which vary by more than 6% under the phonon displacement fields .",
    "the weakness of the electron - phonon matrix elements in the case of c@xmath0 reflects itself also in the shape of the photoemission spectrum of c@xmath6 , as is shown below . in the photoemission experiment",
    ", we are dealing with the process c@xmath6@xmath80",
    "c@xmath0 @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the incident photon and @xmath83 the emitted electron .    in order to define the ground state of c@xmath6 , we start from the full electron - phonon hamiltonian , @xmath84_{ij } c^\\dagger_i c_j (   \\gamma^\\dagger_{\\alpha } + \\gamma_{\\alpha } ) , \\label{heph}\\ ] ] where the first term contains the kohn - sham energies @xmath85 , the second term is the free phonon term and the last term is the usual bilinear electron - phonon coupling term .",
    "the 280 valence electrons of c@xmath0 are assumed to be frozen ( we call @xmath86 their wavefunction ) , while the extra electron of c@xmath6 is assumed to occupy one of the two ( degenerate ) lowest unoccupied states of c@xmath0 whose wavefunctions are labeled by @xmath87 ( @xmath44=1,2 ) . the basis used for solving eq .",
    "( [ heph ] ) is built up with these one electron states coupled to 1 , 2 or 3 different phonons ( let us call @xmath88 a phonon wavefunction ) .",
    "the matrix thus obtained , which turns out to be of the order of 5000 @xmath895000 , is diagonalized by using the lanczos method .",
    "we denote by @xmath90 its lowest eigenvalue and by @xmath91 the corresponding wavefunction .",
    "this should then describe the ground state of the charged molecule c@xmath6 , @xmath92    assuming that the emitted electron does not interact with the system left behind ( sudden approximation  @xcite ) , and that its wavefunction is described by a plane wave , the transition probability for the emission process , from the initial state @xmath91 to a final state of energy @xmath93 in which the neutral c@xmath0 has 1 , 2 or 3 phonons @xmath29 excited ( we denote by @xmath94 the corresponding total vibrational wavefunction ) , is given by the fermi golden rule , @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the ( dipole ) external field , @xmath97 ( the energy of the 280 frozen electrons does not appear neither in the initial nor in the final state ) , and @xmath98 is the electron energy .",
    "if we substitute eq .",
    "( [ totpsi ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ golden ] ) , and assume that the dominant terms are those corresponding to the lumo ( i.e. , to the state @xmath99 ) , we can factor out the dipole matrix element , and we are left with @xmath100    we have plotted the results for @xmath101 in fig .",
    "the scale has been set in such a way that @xmath102 and the numbers in the horizontal axis correspond to @xmath98 .",
    "while the shoulder at 300 cm@xmath59 and the tail extending from 400 to 800 cm@xmath59 indicate the presence of satellite peaks containing 1 and 2 phonons ( as emphasized by the thin curves ) , the rather smooth behavior of the cross section and the strength of the main peak with respect to the satellites , as compared to the corresponding quantities in the case of c@xmath3 , testify to the fact that the electron - phonon coupling in c@xmath6 is much weaker than in c@xmath7 ( see inset of fig .",
    "while the overall behavior of the photoemission cross section predicted by theory is confirmed by the experimental data , lack of resolution does not allow for a detailed comparison .",
    "the calculated electron - phonon coupling in c@xmath0 is found to be about one order of magnitude weaker than in c@xmath3 . in particular",
    ", we estimate the total dimensionless electron ",
    "phonon coupling constant @xmath10 to be about @xmath103 .",
    "the decrease with respect to c@xmath3 is understood on the basis of the symmetry reduction , and the different shape and spatial localization of the lumo wavefunction in c@xmath0 .",
    "the calculated @xmath10 value is consistent with the lack of the superconducting phase transition reported in the literature at temperatures as low as 1 k. this value agrees also with the overall features of two relevant experimental measurements : the broadening of raman peaks in k@xmath5c@xmath0 and the photoemission cross section in c@xmath6 . in the latter case",
    ", experiments with higher resolution would be required to test in detail the theoretical predictions .",
    "this work has been partially supported by the infm advanced research program class .",
