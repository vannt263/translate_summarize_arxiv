    "although there exist numerous cosmological and astrophysical indications which confirm the presence of the non - baryonic dark matter , the nature of this substance remains unknown @xcite .",
    "one of the most important motivations for the extension of the standard model ( sm ) is to introduce an appropriate candidate for dark matter . among the various candidates proposed by the theories beyond the sm , weakly interacting massive particles ( wimp ) are the most popular one .",
    "for instance supersymmetry models with r parity @xcite , the extra dimensional models with conserved kaluza - klein ( kk ) parity @xcite , the t - parity conserved little higgs model @xcite , and so on provide a wimp dark matter candidate . meanwhile , these models introduce others degrees of freedom besides of the dark matter which have not been confirmed experimentally until now .",
    "of course , in addition to the dark matter there exist others motivations such as neutrino oscillation , baryon asymmetry , hierarchy problem , and so on for considering such models .",
    "however , maybe it seems natural to consider the most economical model for the explanation of these anomalies .",
    "for instance , if we want to explain dark matter anomaly , adding a singlet scalar to the sm content to play the dark matter role is the most minimal model .",
    "several authors have studied the singlet scalar dark matter @xcite . alternatively , adding a singlet fermion together with a singlet higgs to the sm content leads to a renormalizable theory for explanation of the dark matter @xcite .",
    "losing the renormalizablity of the theory we can have more minimal model with singlet fermionic dark matter ( sfdm ) @xcite . in all above scenarios ,",
    "the weak interactions of wimps are the main key for explaining the thermal production of them in the early universe ( for review see @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , these weak interactions can provide an opportunity for search dark matter candidates through their production in high energy accelerators @xcite , their direct detection @xcite , and their indirect detection i.e. astrophysical observations of the annihilation or decay products of the dark matter in our galaxy or beyond .",
    "in fact , the dark matter anomaly is a mutual problem between particle physics and astrophysics ; on one hand , we need to know particle physical properties of dark matter to attribute a galaxy distribution to it and on the other hand we need to know the distribution of the dark matter to construe a direct or indirect detected signals as dark matter signals .    in the wimp scenario , the weak interaction of dark matter would produce observable sm particles , such as charged anti - matter particles , photons and neutrinos . among these ,",
    "neutrinos and photons have advantage in comparison to others because they keep their source information during the streaming .",
    "moreover , the very small cross sections of the neutrinos make their flux very difficult to detect .",
    "therefore , the gamma ray signature of the dark matter has been investigated extensively ( for review see @xcite and references therein ) . since the continuum gamma ray emission from dark matter annihilation could be confused with astrophysical backgrounds , e.g. emission from galactic cosmic rays or millisecond pulsars , the study of the monochromatic gamma ray is important .",
    "monochromatic gamma ray signatures have been studied for some dark matter candidates in the literature @xcite . in this paper",
    "we investigate monochromatic gamma ray in the context of the sfdm model .",
    "the most minimal model , which includes a singlet fermion to serve as dark matter , is discussed in @xcite . in this model the leading interaction between dark matter and the sm particle is given by the dimension - five term @xmath1 .",
    "here @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the sm higgs doublet , the dark matter fermion and a new physics scale , respectively . moreover , it is possible to explain the dark matter production in the early universe by a renormalizable theory if the higgs sector of the sm is extended by a new singlet higgs @xcite .",
    "also in the noncommutative space - time we can have a singlet fermionic dark matter which is involved in the noncommutative induced @xmath5 gauge theory @xcite .",
    "there are also some others phenomenological studies on this model @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we reobtain the thermal average of the annihilation of sfdm into the sm particles",
    ". then , demanding the correct relic abundance we derive the coupling of sfdm with the singlet higgs versus dark matter mass . for this calculation",
    "we use a set of higgs masses so that the recent cms and atlas results are respected .",
    "then we obtain the cross section of the annihilation of sfdm pairs into two photons .",
    "the thermal average of this cross section is calculated throughout a favorite wimp mass interval including resonance region .",
    "we depict the sfdm annihilation cross section into two photons versus dark matter mass , @xmath6 , using @xmath0 consistent with relic abundance condition .",
    "we have organized the paper as follows : in the next section , we review the renormalizable extension of the sm by a singlet fermion which can be served as a cold dark matter and derive the @xmath0 consistent with the relic density abundance . in section [ sec3 ] , we calculate the two photons annihilation of the singlet fermion pairs and its thermally averaged cross section . we summarize our result in the last section .",
    "it is possible to consider a singlet dirac fermion beyond the sm which can serve as cold dark matter .",
    "the lepton number and baryon number of this new fermion are taken to be zero .",
    "hence , there is not any mixing between the new fermion and the sm fermions .",
    "if a singlet higgs is added to this model , the interactions between the singlet fermion and sm particles can be explained by a renormalizable manner .",
    "explicitly , the singlet fermion and singlet higgs are coupled as follows : _ int = g_s|s , and the singlet higgs can be coupled with the sm higgs through the following terms : [ hs]l_sh=-_1h^hs-_2h^hs^2.therefore , in addition to the above terms , we need to add the following terms for singlet fermion and singlet higgs to the sm lagrangian : _ = |(i/-m_),[selfs]l_s=1 2 ( _ s)(^s)-s^2-s^3-s^4.the scalar potential given in ( [ hs ] ) and ( [ selfs ] ) together with the sm potential , @xmath7 , lead to the vacuum expectation values h= (    c 0 + v_0 +    ) s = x_0 for the sm higgs doublet which gives rise to the electroweak symmetry breaking and for the singlet scalar higgs , respectively .",
    "these quantities are written with respect to the parameters introduced in the lagrangian by the following relations derived from the extremum conditions , @xmath8 and @xmath9 : & & ^2=_0v_0 ^ 2+(_1+_2x_0)x_0 , + & & m_0 ^ 2=-x_0-x_0 ^ 2 - -_2v_0 ^ 2.we define the scalar fields @xmath10 and @xmath11 as the deviation from the vacuum expectation values of @xmath2 and @xmath12 , respectively . as it is obvious",
    "these fields are not mass eigenstates .",
    "the various components of the mass matrix are written as follows : & & ^2_h_h = s=0=2_0v_0 ^ 2 , + & & ^2_s_h = s=0=x_0+x_0 ^ 2- , + & & ^2_hs_h = s=0=(_1 + 2_2x_0)v_0 .",
    "the mass eigenstates @xmath13 and @xmath14 are h_1= ( ) s+ ( ) h , + h_2= ( ) s- ( ) h , where the mixing angle @xmath15 is defined by ( ) , with @xmath16 . the higgs boson masses @xmath17 and @xmath18 are given by m^2_1,2=. this extension of the sm introduces some new parameters . in the sense of experiment , there exist allowed regions in the parameters space where it is possible to explain the relic abundance of the singlet fermions so that they serve as cold dark matter @xcite . before the study of monochromatic gamma ray ,",
    "we give a reanalysis of the relevant parameters . at the tree level of perturbation ,",
    "the annihilation of the singlet fermions into the standard model particles is given by @xcite v_rel & = & ( 1- ) + & & ( + .",

    "now we can compute the thermal average of the cross section over @xmath11 , @xmath28 , which is given by @xcite [ thermal average ] v=_4m^2^ds ( s)(s-4m^2)k_1 ( ) , where @xmath29 is the modified bessel function of order @xmath30 .",

    "we consider the sfdm with mass below 200 gev which is the range of fermi - lat data in hand @xcite .",
    "moreover , we take the sm higgs mass 125 gev which is consistent with the new reported value by atlas and cms , and 500 gev for the other higgs .",
    "therefore , the annihilation of sfdms into higgs particles is not possible .",
    "there are a couple of free parameters in the thermally averaged annihilation cross section , in addition to the dark matter mass and higgs masses : the coupling between the singlet fermion and singlet higgs , @xmath0 , the higgses mixing parameter @xmath15 , and the coupling constants between singlet higgs and the sm higgs , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the dependency of @xmath35 and @xmath36 occurs through the decay width of the higgs messenger to the lighter higgs in denominator , so in our desired range of energy these coupling constants are not relevant .",
    "this decay rate is also dependent on the mixing angle which is fixed in our calculation .",
    "demanding the correct relic abundance for the dark matter we derive @xmath0 in terms of @xmath6 . since in our calculations",

    "it is clear that , if one considers a stronger mixing then the values of @xmath0 should be smaller . it is notable that , the valley represents the first resonance region where the dark matter mass is about half of the standard model higgs mass .",

    "now , according to the model presented in the previous section , we derive the cross section for the annihilation of two dark matter particles into gamma ray pairs .",
