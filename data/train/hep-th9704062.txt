    "it is generally difficult to conclude the suppression or enhancement of the quantum coherence solely from the perturbation formula  ( [ eq : five.eleven ] ) .",
    "the reason is that the effect of intermediate state sum can depend on the details of the upper potential curve .",
    "nevertheless , when the well of the upper potential is narrow enough , we can show that the quantum coherence is always suppressed .",

    "( [ eq : five.eleven ] ) gives for the parity odd state , @xmath164 since the second term of  ( [ eq : five.eighteen ] ) is negative definite , we see that the perturbation always lowers the odd state energy , @xmath165    the perturbative corrections in ( [ eq : five.seventeen ] ) and  ( [ eq : five.eighteen ] ) are proportional to the wave function at the origin , which satisfies @xmath166 $ ]  @xcite , and therefore the correction to the energy splitting itself is proportional to the zeroth order energy splitting , @xmath167 .",
    "since the correction can not excess the zeroth order value in a reliable region of perturbation theory , we should have @xmath168 . by combining ( [ eq : five.twentyone ] ) and  ( [ eq : five.nineteen ] ) , therefore we find @xmath169 which shows that the quantum coherence is suppressed .    although we derived the suppression of quantum coherence for the very special configuration in the weak coupling adiabatic picture",
    ", we expect that this suppression of quantum coherence is more general at least for small  @xmath11 .",
    "this is based on the following physical picture : when a particle tunnels the barrier in the lower potential curve , it has a small probability to cross to the upper potential curve .",
    "this potential curve crossing means that the particle enters deep inside the tunneling region of the upper potential curve and repelled back by the upper potential ( as is expected in the diabatic picture ) , which in turn leads to the suppression of quantum tunneling of the particle .",
    "this argument leads to the general suppression of quantum coherence by potential crossing .",
    "this is also consistent with the suppression of barrier transmission in the scattering process by the non - adiabatic potential crossing effect  @xcite .",
    "our explicit analyses both in the weak and strong potential crossing interactions suggest the general suppression of quantum coherence by potential crossing , which is analogous to the effect of ohmic dissipation on quantum coherence  @xcite . in this connection",
    ", we may note that the formula  ( [ eq : five.eleven ] ) and the ohmic dissipation in the caldeira - legget model  @xcite both correspond to the dipole approximation .",
    "however , an analysis of the basically non - perturbative tunneling effect in the second order perturbation theory needs a great care ; for this reason , we were able to explicitly analyze the very specific case in ( [ eq : five.fourteen])([eq : five.sixteen ] ) .",
    "this suppression phenomenon of quantum coherence may become important in the future when one takes the effects of the environment into account in the analysis of potential curve crossing in physical and chemical processes .",
    "motivated by the presence of interesting weak and strong duality in the model hamiltonian  ( [ eq : two.one ] ) of potential curve crossing , we analyzed a perturbative approach to potential crossing phenomena .",
    "we have shown that straightforward perturbation theory combined with the zeroth order wkb wave functions provides a reliable description of general potential crossing phenomena .",
    "our analysis is based on the local data as much as possible without referring to global stokes phenomena  @xcite .",
    "formulated in this manner , perturbation theory becomes more flexible to cover a wide range of problems . from a perturbative view point ,",
    "the treatment of the landau - zener formula in the adiabatic picture is most complicated since it does not contain the coupling constant in the prefactor .",
    "we pointed out that this absence of the coupling constant in the prefactor is related to the presence of an interesting kink - like topological object in the present formulation of adiabatic picture .",
    "the absence of the coupling constant in the prefactor is thus perfectly consistent with perturbation theory , provided that a more precise criterion of perturbation theory  ( [ eq : two.eleven ] ) is satisfied . in effect , we explained why the prefactor of the landau - zener formula should come out to be very close to unity in perturbation theory .    the suppression of quantum coherence by potential curve crossing , which to our knowledge has not been discussed before in this context ,",
    "has also been neatly formulated in our treatment , in the both limits of very strong and very weak potential crossing interactions .    from a view point of general gauge theory ,",
    "it is not unlikely that the electric - magnetic duality in conventional gauge theory is also related to some generalized form of potential crossing in the so - called moduli space  @xcite .",
    "we hope that our work may turn out to be relevant from this view point also .",
