    "in recent years a variety of observations and observational methods have been used to contribute to our understanding of the global star formation history of the universe .",
    "it is generally agreed that @xmath1 , the comoving space density of the star formation rate ( sfr ) in galaxies , rises by an order of magnitude between @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite . despite several observations encompassing @xmath4 and @xmath5 however ,",
    "@xcite it is still unclear whether the evolution of @xmath1 reaches a peak around @xmath6 and decreases significantly thereafter ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "there is a clear discrepancy between values of @xmath1 estimated from observations at radio or far - infrared ( fir ) wavelengths and those estimated from h@xmath0 and uv measurements .",
    "even when simple extinction corrections to the uv and h@xmath0 measurements are made , however , systematic differences persist between estimates of sfr or @xmath1 made at differing wavelengths , this can be seen , for example , in the distribution of sfrs for ( 1 ) individual objects in a study of local galaxies by ( * ? ? ?",

    "several efforts have been made to address this concern .",
    "a detailed investigation of some of these issues is presented in @xcite , with particular emphasis on obscuration at uv wavelengths .",

    "we extend these investigations by first deriving an sfr - dependent ( or luminosity - dependent ) attenuation from existing observations .",
    "we then examine its efficacy by applying it to h@xmath0 and uv estimates of sfr for a large sample of local galaxies .",
    "the examination is subsequently expanded to investigate the effects of the application to global sfr densities , derived from h@xmath0 or uv measurements , spanning a broad redshift range ,    in section  [ firjust ] we comment on the use of fir and 1.4ghz luminosities as estimators of sfr .",

    "the intrinsic sfr of a galaxy can not be estimated directly from observations at uv or optical wavelengths because of the uncertainties caused by the presence of unknown amounts of obscuring dust .",
    "indicators of sfr at longer wavelengths , at which dust is transparent , are sought as an alternative . in the past few decades fir luminosity has been used extensively as an estimator of current star formation rate in galaxies , and throughout this paper we have adopted the calibration given by @xcite , which is shown in table  [ sfrcal ] . while fir luminosity is expected to be an excellent sfr tracer for strong , compact , dusty starbursts , the situation is less clear when",
    "the disks of normal galaxies are being examined .",
    "the uncertainties in using fir luminosity as an sfr estimator for normal galaxies are described by @xcite , and while fir luminosity in late - type star - forming galaxies appears to correlate well with other estimators of sfr , this is not generally the case for early - type spirals and ellipticals .    at still longer wavelengths ,",

    "admittedly , there are still concerns over the details of the physical processes which produce this correlation @xcite . while the currently favoured explanation are processes related to star formation",

    "the scatter in the radio - fir correlation for disk galaxies , while smaller , is also significant and its origins remain unknown . despite these concerns , long - wavelength estimators of sfr",
    "provide a valuable tool which avoids the effects of obscuration , thus allowing useful insights into the properties of star formation in various galaxy populations .",
    "star forming galaxies in the local universe have been shown to exhibit a correlation between obscuration and fir luminosity , as seen for example in @xcite .",
    "this implies that the obscuration in a galaxy is related to its sfr .",
    "this same general effect can also be seen in other recent results , e.g. , @xcite , particularly their figure  11 , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "@xcite demonstrate a trend between fir luminosity ( @xmath21 ) and the inverse of the balmer decrement for a small population of normal hubble types as well as some markarian starbursts .",
    "a similarly small sample of nuclear starburst and blue compact galaxies analysed by @xcite show a clear trend between colour excess , ( or uv spectral index ) , and @xmath21 .",
    "both trends are in the sense of increasing obscuration with increasing @xmath21 .",
    "the scatter in these trends is notable , however , and may be related to intrinsic differences within galaxy populations , as well as between the different populations analysed .    now , since fir luminosity for these objects can be treated as an estimator of a galaxy s _ intrinsic _ star formation rate , this suggests that these relations can be recast in terms of obscuration ( colour excess , for example ) and sfr@xmath22 . using the data of @xcite we perform a least squares fit to the balmer decrement ( not its inverse ) and @xmath23 to derive @xmath24",

    ". we can combine equations [ bdecvsfir ] and [ dust ] to form a direct relationship between colour excess and fir luminosity .",
    "figure  [ ebvsfir ] shows the resulting relation , along with the data used to derive equation  [ bdecvsfir ] , ( modified from figure  10 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and data taken from the independent sample of starburst and blue compact galaxies by @xcite . since a negative colour excess is unphysical , we assume that luminosities which give rise to @xmath30 from this relation correspond to zero attenuation , and this is seen in the flattening of the line in figure  [ ebvsfir ] .",
    "below @xmath31 the data from @xcite appear to be consistent with the trend seen in the @xcite data , but at higher luminosities even greater colour excesses are seen .",
    "this suggests that for high - sfr galaxies in the local universe , the following analysis may be somewhat conservative .",
    "the relation between colour excess and fir luminosity can now be transformed to one between colour excess and sfr , using our adopted calibration for sfr@xmath22 , and we then find the colour excess appropriate to a given _ intrinsic _ sfr : @xmath32.\\ ] ]    this , then , forms the crux of an sfr - dependent reddening relation . given the intrinsic sfr for a galaxy ( which may be derived from radio as well as fir luminosities , for example ) , and a reddening curve , the attenuation to be applied at all wavelengths can be calculated . using the standard formulation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the intrinsic luminosity , @xmath33 , is related to the observed value , @xmath34 , by : @xmath35 and since all the assumed sfr calibrations are directly proportional to luminosity , this can be considered to be a relation between intrinsic and observed sfr .",
    "additionally , and most importantly , since equation  [ crux ] is monotonic even a measurement of the _ attenuated _ sfr can be used to estimate the amount of reddening .",
    "this is done by substituting equation  [ crux ] into equation  [ standard ] ( cast in terms of sfr rather than luminosity , since the sfr calibration constant cancels ) and solving numerically the resulting transcendental equation , which for the wavelength of h@xmath0 can be written : @xmath36 .",
    "\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , by assuming such a form for an sfr - dependent obscuration , even observations of a single h@xmath0 emission line ( or other star - formation - sensitive line , such as [ oii ] ) may be used to estimate attenuation and intrinsic sfr .",
    "now the colour excess appropriate for the stellar continuum , @xmath37 , is related to that for nebular gas emission lines by @xmath38 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as a result it should in principle be possible to apply the same procedure to derive appropriate corrections for uv - continuum estimates of sfr .",
    "combining equations  [ gasstar ] , [ crux ] and [ standard ] gives the following relation for uv wavelengths : @xmath39 , \\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "recent results from @xcite suggest , however , that observed ( attenuated ) uv luminosity at short wavelengths ( @xmath43 nm ) is a very poor indicator of sfr .",
    "they find that while galaxies with high sfrs ( and intrinsic uv luminosities ) show increased levels of obscuration ( see figure  11 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) consistent with our primary assumption , the obscuration is such as to attenuate the observed uv luminosities to a remarkably constant level for a broad range of extinctions ( see figure  17 of * ? ? ?",
    "this results in a situation where equation  [ uvtransc ] effectively becomes degenerate , and a knowledge of only the observed uv luminosity is insufficient to regain information about the extent of the obscuration and the corresponding intrinsic luminosity or sfr .",
    "in contrast with this result , figure  3 from @xcite , comparing sfr@xmath8 derived from observations at @xmath44 nm to sfr@xmath45 , does not show the expected degeneracy , suggesting that perhaps the effect is stronger at shorter wavelengths .",
    "as we later show , we also find no such degeneracy in u - band derived sfrs , supporting this suggestion .",
    "the above method is thus explored below with regard to uv luminosities using the relations already derived , but placing emphasis on wavelengths longer than 160 nm which appear less likely to show this degenerate effect .",
    "the relationship between ( obscured ) h@xmath0- and uv - based measures of sfr and measurements of intrinsic sfr ( for which we use sfr@xmath22 or sfr@xmath45 ) are given by equations  [ hatransc ] and [ uvtransc ] .",
    "these relations are compared with observational measurements for a sample of local galaxies in figures  [ extfir ] and [ extrad ] , using data selected from the compilation of @xcite .",
    "figure  [ extrad ] emphasises the validity of the radio - fir correlation for this sample , and justifies the strong emphasis on 1.4ghz based estimates of sfr ( and subsequently @xmath1 ) in our analysis .",
    "the  knee \" of the curves shown in figures  [ extfir ] and [ extrad ] marks the sfr at which the derived colour excess from equation  [ crux ] goes to zero from higher values at higher sfrs .",
    "for sfrs lower than this value we assume there is no attenuation of the observed luminosity ( and hence sfr ) .",
    "the sfr - dependent reddening formulation seems to account well for the observed discrepancy between sfr@xmath46 and sfr@xmath22 or sfr@xmath45 ( figures  [ extfir]a and [ extrad]a ) .",
    "it is also clear that , while this prescription may be useful for examining the trends over large samples , the extent of the intrinsic scatter in the relevant correlations seen in the observations , is quite large , up to two orders of magnitude in some cases .",
    "any detailed analysis of individual galaxies should thus be treated with caution , and quoted uncertainties in any derived results should reflect this .",
    "the attenuation of the uv - derived sfrs , however , appears to be less effectively modelled . as shown by the dot - dashed lines in figures  [ extfir](b ) and [ extrad](b ) the attenuation implied at u - band by equation  [ uvtransc ]",
    "is insufficient to reproduce the observed sfr@xmath8 .",
    "the observations of local galaxies imply even greater levels of obscuration , and the degeneracy in observed uv luminosities with respect to intrinsic uv luminosity found by @xcite possibly suggest greater levels still . the trend seen by @xcite",
    "could be illustrated in figures  [ extfir](b ) and [ extrad](b ) by a horizontal line at sfr@xmath47yr@xmath12 , for intrinsic sfrs @xmath48yr@xmath12 .",
    "this would intercept the solid line in these figures at a value of intrinsic sfr @xmath49yr@xmath12 , ( less for the longer uv wavelength models ) and the implied obscuration would be greater than given by equation  [ uvtransc ] ( for @xmath50 nm ) for objects with larger intrinsic sfrs . again ,",
    "knowledge of only the observed uv luminosity would be insufficient to establish the extent of the obscuration in the degenerate case .    to establish whether or not the trend seen in the local u - band measurements is consistent with the results of @xcite",
    ", we have applied several robust regression algorithms @xcite to the data of figures  [ extfir](b ) and [ extrad](b ) .",
    "we find positive , non - zero slopes in all cases , even when considering only data having values of intrinsic sfr @xmath48yr@xmath12 ( the  flattest \" portion of these diagrams ) .",
    "our best estimate of the slope , from the ordinary least squares bisector @xcite , is @xmath51 ( for logarithmic values of sfr ) , with a pearson correlation coefficient of 0.5 .",
    "this may be compared with an approximate slope of 0.68 ( for @xmath52sfr@xmath53 ) for the relation predicted by equation  [ uvtransc ] at 150 nm ( _ not _ u - band ) .",
    "this result will be made use of in section  [ empirical ] .",
    "while it is possible that some incompleteness in the data has artificially skewed the slope to positive values , it is also possible that there is a real trend in the u - band data which is absent in the shorter wavelength ( 160 nm ) data .",
    "this suggestion is not unreasonable , as the level of obscuration expected at u - band ( 365 nm ) is less than at 160 nm for a given intrinsic luminosity , or sfr .",
    "it is also consistent with the non - degenerate trend seen in figure  3 of @xcite based on 200 nm observations .",
    "if this is the case , then it is possible that a method similar to the one we analyse here may be useful for correcting uv observations at wavelengths between u - band and 160 nm .",
    "indeed , it should be emphasised that the empirical trends presented by the uv data ( both in figures  [ extfir](b ) and [ extrad](b ) , as well as figure  3 of @xcite @xcite , and in @xcite @xcite ) are still evidence of a form of sfr - dependent obscuration , albeit one implying even greater levels of attenuation than predicted by equation  [ uvtransc ] .",
    "we have so far considered the effects of a sfr - dependent obscuration on samples of galaxies taken from the local universe .",
    "now , building on the conclusions of the previous section , we consider how this might affect the evolution of the global sfr density , given the simplified assumption of no evolution in the properties or effects of dust . in light of the shortfall in the level of attenuation predicted by equation  [ uvtransc ]",
    "we will treat the magnitude of the predicted corrections to @xmath9 as lower limits to the required correction , and examine the resulting implications .",
    "in applying the sfr - dependent reddening correction to samples at high redshifts , we need to assume that the locally - derived trend between obscuration and sfr is still valid . obviously this may not be the case , particularly since our understanding of galaxy evolution implies that the metallicity of the inter - stellar medium increases with time .",
    "for example , @xcite find a dearth of high - redshift galaxies with @xmath54 .",
    "extremely red galaxies , a class of objects defined by @xmath55 , may actually be a population of dusty star - forming galaxies at high redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , however , so the extent of obscuration at high redshifts is still unclear ( but see also the discussion of such objects in * ? ? ? * ) . in the absence of more extensive evolutionary constraints",
    ", we begin with this simple assumption and anticipate that ( 1 ) evolutionary effects may be able to be incorporated as more data becomes available , and ( 2 ) remaining discrepancies will serve to direct attention to those wavelengths and redshifts deserving of further investigation .",
    "we present a compilation of uncorrected global sfr density ( @xmath1 ) measurements in figure  [ sfd1 ] .",
    "this emphasises the magnitude of the attenuation corrections required to reconcile the various estimates at different wavelengths .",
    "in addition to the uv surveys @xcite and h@xmath0 surveys @xcite , we also show results from fir observations @xcite and 1.4ghz radio surveys @xcite .",
    "all measurements have been converted to our assumed cosmology and sfr calibrations for consistency .    to correct existing uv and h@xmath0 estimates of @xmath1 using the sfr - dependent reddening formulation described above",
    "requires a knowledge not just of @xmath1 itself , but of the appropriate h@xmath0 or uv luminosity function , since the corrections to be applied are sfr ( and hence luminosity ) dependent .",
    "we have initially considered our derived relations , applying the corrections derived from equations  [ hatransc ] and [ uvtransc ] for a number of published h@xmath0 and uv surveys , sampling a broad redshift range .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ sfd2 ] .",
    "the local 1.4ghz measurement from @xcite of @xmath56yr@xmath12mpc@xmath57 ( after converting to @xmath58 and using our assumed sfr@xmath45 calibration ) , derived from a measurement of the local 1.4ghz lf of revised shapley - ames spiral galaxies , is consistent with the value of @xmath59yr@xmath12mpc@xmath57 obtained by integrating the local 1.4ghz lf for spiral galaxies from @xcite .",
    "also shown in figure  [ sfd2 ] are two models for the evolution of @xmath1 .",
    "the solid line is derived from a fit to the evolving 1.4ghz lf for star - forming galaxies , measured by @xcite and based on the local lf of @xcite , and is anchored at @xmath2 by that point .",
    "the dashed line is a model for the fir luminosity density derived by @xcite from measurements of the cosmic far - infrared background .",
    "this model has been converted to sfr density using the sfr calibration of fir luminosity given by @xcite .",
    "the effectiveness of correcting estimates of @xmath1 by assuming an sfr - dependent obscuration is discussed separately below for three broad redshift regimes .      for redshifts out to @xmath61 applying the sfr - dependent correction to ( 1 ) the uncorrected uv lfs of @xcite and @xcite , and ( 2 ) the n[ii ] and aperture corrected ( but not extinction corrected ) h@xmath0 lf of @xcite all give consistent results .",
    "the magnitude of the correction for @xmath9 in this redshift range is a factor of about 3 .",
    "while this correction may need to be considered a lower limit the true value is probably not much greater than this , since both corrected @xmath9 estimates and the corrected @xmath62 estimate are consistent with the trend in the radio - based @xmath1 measurements spanning this redshift range ( see also section  [ empirical ] ) .",
    "the one remaining discrepancy is a factor of @xmath63 difference between the 1.4ghz and h@xmath0 based estimates of @xmath1 at @xmath64 .",
    "the results of @xcite are shown in figure  [ sfd2 ] with the reddening correction originally applied by those authors .",
    "@xcite have also derived a local h@xmath0 sfr density which is consistent with this measurement .",
    "the sfr - dependent formulation results in a correction similar to the @xmath65 magnitude often assumed for this local population , and is unlikely to increase by more than a few tens of percent the value of @xcite .",
    "( at higher redshifts the evolving h@xmath0 lf provides greater numbers of higher luminosity systems , which results in larger corrections to @xmath62 . )",
    "@xcite address this discrepancy by suggesting that a significant fraction of star formation occurs in the cores of giant molecular clouds , which would imply much greater obscuration than derived from a balmer decrement reddening correction assuming a simple dust screen .",
    "regardless of the mechanism , however , the obscuration must be such that it explains the observed trends of figures  [ extfir ] and [ extrad ] .",
    "hence , at least in the local universe , the correction can not be much greater than that which we examine in this analysis . at higher redshifts ,",
    "perhaps , the amount of attenuation could be greater , although the trend of figure  [ extfir](a ) is sufficient to explain the discrepancy in @xmath62 at @xmath66 ( see section  [ z2 ] ) .    an alternative explanation for this discrepancy questions the calibration of sfr@xmath45 .",
    "this is ultimately based on the calibration of non - thermal radio luminosity , @xmath67 , to supernova rate , @xmath68 , in our own galaxy @xcite .",
    "if the escape of cosmic ray electrons from our galaxy is significant , lowering the observed @xmath67 for a given sfr , then the derived calibration constant will be larger than had we seen all the radio emission .",
    "hence , in external systems where we may see more , even most , of the radio emission produced by the star - formation , the derived sfr will be too great . @xcite",
    "argues against this scenario , however , stating that significant variations in the ratio @xmath69 would violate the observed radio - fir correlation .    a third possibility is suggested by preliminary estimates of the local h@xmath0 luminosity density from the kpno international spectroscopic survey ( kiss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this survey finds a local h@xmath0 luminosity density somewhat higher than that measured by @xcite .      within this redshift regime",
    "there is a discrepancy between estimates of @xmath71 from different analyses . for @xmath72 ,",
    "the fir - based values of @xcite are comparable to the radio - based results of @xcite , but those of @xcite lie a factor of @xmath73 lower ( figure  [ sfd1 ] ) .",
    "possible sources for this discrepancy have been discussed by @xcite , who emphasise that their analysis covers a much larger area than that of @xcite , and uses different methods for fitting galaxy spectral energy distributions .    from @xmath74 , the application of the sfr - dependent reddening to h@xmath0 lfs @xcite results in sfr densities which are consistent with the observational radio - derived values , and the fir - derived values of @xcite .",
    "this is highly encouraging , and suggests that the form of sfr - dependent reddening described by equation  [ hatransc ] may be applicable as far out as @xmath75 .",
    "it also implies little evolution in the form and extent of obscuration , at least in a global , population - averaged sense .",
    "obviously details for individual galaxies will vary significantly , as evidenced by the large scatter in figures  [ extfir ] and [ extrad ] .",
    "the integration of the luminosity function to derive estimates of @xmath1 has the effect of averaging over this scatter , minimising its effect .",
    "the resulting integral measure is thus more robust to the variations in individual galaxies , and reflects instead the general trend such as that modelled by equation  [ hatransc ] . a further observational estimate of @xmath62 at @xmath76 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* not shown in figures  [ sfd1]-[sfd3 ] ) may also be consistent with these results , as they comment that their value is consistent with the ",
    "high \" estimate of @xcite if they apply the calzetti prescription for dust attenuation .    the same treatment with the uv lfs of @xcite give a factor of @xmath77 corrections to @xmath9 .",
    "the corrected @xmath9 still lies a factor of @xmath73 lower than @xmath71 , @xmath78 or the corrected @xmath62 ( figure  [ sfd2 ] ) .",
    "this is not unexpected , and is consistent with the interpretation of equation  [ uvtransc ] as providing lower limits for the corrected @xmath9 .",
    "it is possible , on the other hand , that lower metallicities and obscurations at higher redshifts for galaxies of a given luminosity imply some evolution in the calibration of sfr@xmath8 .",
    "such an effect would be in the sense that a given _ observed _ uv luminosity at higher redshifts implies _ lower _ levels of sfr .",
    "this would give a calibration coefficient which decreases with redshift , reducing the observed @xmath9 , and the correction for any obscuration would also decrease with redshift .",
    "if this effect is large enough , it could exacerbate the discrepancy between @xmath9 and the 1.4ghz and fir estimates .",
    "this extreme scenario would be inconsistent with the results of the h@xmath0 corrections in this redshift regime , which suggest that any such evolution in the level of obscuration is probably small .      at the high redshift end , @xmath80 ,",
    "the uv lfs of @xcite have also been re - examined assuming an sfr - dependent reddening . despite the large uncertainties associated with extrapolating equation  [ uvtransc ] to high redshifts , and the expectation that in its present form the correction is likely to be underestimated",
    ", it is encouraging to see that the results lie midway between the predictions of the two models shown .",
    "the corrected estimates using equation  [ uvtransc ] are bracketed by the predictions from the model evolving radio lf and the fir background model .",
    "they are also consistent with the lower limit derived from sub - mm scuba observations of the hubble deep field @xcite , @xmath81yr@xmath12mpc@xmath57 in our cosmology .",
    "the correction derived from equation  [ uvtransc ] approaches a factor of 10 at @xmath82 , and may _ still _ need to be considered a lower limit to the true correction given the results of @xcite .",
    "the extremely large uncertainties associated with extrapolating the locally - derived sfr - dependent reddening models to such high redshifts , though , dictate the use of caution when interpreting these results .",
    "it is still interesting to note that if these corrections are indeed underestimates and the true values need to be higher , they would lie closer to the extrapolations from the 1.4ghz luminosity functions estimated by @xcite , almost an order of magnitude above the estimates from the fir background .",
    "the inadequacy of equation  [ uvtransc ] in fully explaining the observed levels of obscuration prompts two questions .",
    "the obvious one relates to the origin of the obscuration , and is discussed briefly below .",
    "the second is :  independent of the mechanism producing the obscuration , is the local _ empirical _ relation between sfr@xmath8 and intrinsic sfr sufficient to explain the discrepancies in @xmath1 at higher redshifts ? \"",
    "we examine this by applying the empirical relationship for local galaxies observed in figures  [ extfir](b ) and [ extrad](b ) to @xmath9 measurements at all redshifts .    for this simple analysis",
    "we treat the relationship between sfr@xmath8 and sfr@xmath22 ( or sfr@xmath45 ) described by the @xmath83 m attenuation ( the solid curve in these figures ) as a mathematically convenient description of this empirical relation .",
    "we also assume this relationship is valid at shorter wavelengths ( where the attenuation may be still greater , given the results of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but particularly at @xmath84 m , where the measurements from @xcite were made .",
    "applying the sfr - dependent correction to all the @xmath9 points based on this empirical result gives the diagram shown in figure  [ sfd3 ] .",
    "good agreement is now seen between all uv , h@xmath0 and radio - derived values for @xmath1 .",
    "the effectiveness of this application is dominated by the effective correction to the data of @xcite , since the corrections at low - redshift are not modified greatly ( due to the lf being dominated by lower - luminosity sources ) .",
    "the primary conclusion here is that the empirical relation between local u - band estimates of sfr@xmath8 and intrinsic sfr is sufficient to account for obscuration in 280 nm observations at @xmath85 .",
    "two possible scenarios to explain the shortcomings of equation  [ uvtransc ] are discussed in this light .",
    "first , dust in star forming galaxies may be characterised by a reddening curve even greyer than that of @xcite .",
    "the situation may be explained if the attenuation at wavelengths between @xmath86 m is comparable to that observed locally in u - band .",
    "one model producing this effect may be a heavily dust - enshrouded starburst , optically thick below @xmath87 m , but having  holes \" which allow some portion of uv light to escape unattenuated .",
    "this would result in a uniform  blocking \" of all emission below the optically thick cutoff , and produce the required constant attenuation as a function of ( uv ) wavelength .",
    "the effective reddening curve for this scenario may , however , not be consistent with the results of the fir dust luminosity analysis presented in @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the dust attenuation remains as given by @xcite , but there is some additional process which needs to be invoked to explain the shortfall in the u - band derived sfrs seen in figures  [ extfir](b ) and [ extrad](b ) .",
    "this may be the case , for example , if the relative contribution of the old stellar population to the u - band luminosity is greater at low sfr .",
    "( luminosities at shorter uv wavelengths would have less  contamination \" from the old stars , so would be affected less or not at all in this scenario . )",
    "this would imply that the u - band derived sfrs in low - sfr systems are _ over_-estimated , and need to be revised downward .",
    "then , combined with a suitable revision of the u - band / sfr calibration , this would account for the discrepancies .",
    "there are still problems with this suggestion as well , since low - sfr systems also tend to be low - luminosity systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* their figure  3 ) , and this implies the _ relative _ contribution from the old stellar population may not change much with sfr .",
    "in addition , whatever mechanism is invoked needs to be able to reproduce the degenerate relationship between observed uv luminosity and obscuration at shorter wavelengths found by @xcite .",
    "more investigation of the result described here is obviously still required .",
    "although the application of the locally observed empirical sfr@xmath8 to sfr@xmath22 relation to shorter wavelengths and higher redshifts may account for the @xmath9 discrepancies it does not explain their physical origin .",
    "it does emphasise that the trend observed locally in u - band is consistent with the discrepancies at much higher redshifts and at shorter wavelengths .",
    "this is consistent with the result for the h@xmath0 correction suggesting little net evolution , if any , in the level of obscuration at least out to @xmath88 .",
    "we have modelled an sfr - dependent attenuation by dust , characterised by the calzetti reddening curve .",
    "corrections derived from this model have been applied to a large sample of local galaxies , spanning a wide range in intrinsic sfr , to examine the effects on local h@xmath0- and uv - derived sfr estimates .",
    "subsequently , measurements of @xmath1 for a broad range of redshift have also been corrected using this model .",
    "it is clear from the observational data investigated here , as well as the smaller samples of @xcite and @xcite , that some form of sfr - dependent extinction is implied .",
    "the investigated prescription appears sufficient to explain the general trend between sfr@xmath46 and sfr@xmath45 or sfr@xmath22 .",
    "it also accounts for the discrepancies between estimates of @xmath62 and @xmath78 or @xmath71 out to @xmath88 , with the exclusion of the local @xmath62 estimate of @xcite .",
    "this is strongly suggestive of little or no evolution in the extent or form of the obscuration at rest - frame h@xmath0 wavelengths . as a result ,",
    "this may serve as a useful tool in making corrections for obscuration in estimates of sfr@xmath46 or @xmath62 in the absence of more direct methods ( such as for the nicmos grism surveys of @xcite and @xcite , and the recent sofi / isaac results of @xcite , which lack balmer decrement information ) .",
    "the examined prescription for correcting uv - based estimates of sfr and @xmath1 was less effective .",
    "although the predicted corrections reduce the level of observed discrepancy with obscuration - free estimators , they do not fully account for the observed levels of attenuation in local u - band estimates of sfr@xmath8 .",
    "there may also be concerns that a degenerate relation ( at shorter wavelengths ) would prevent application of the iterative method used .",
    "the use of this method to estimate lower limits for the corrections to @xmath9 is more encouraging , though , particularly for @xmath89 where the magnitude of the required correction is unlikely to increase by much .",
    "the situation becomes more complex at higher redshifts , and here evolutionary effects , as well as a more complete understanding of the obscuration in galaxies at uv - wavelengths , may need to be incorporated .    the empirical relationship observed at u - band for local galaxies between sfr@xmath8 and sfr@xmath22 or sfr@xmath45 was also examined .",
    "it was used to correct high - redshift estimates of @xmath9 , resulting in values consistent with @xmath78 and @xmath71 for uv wavelengths longer than 160 nm .",
    "this may support the result from the h@xmath0 analysis , suggesting minimal evolution in the extent of dust obscuration .",
    "the mechanisms producing the obscuration are still in question , and prompt further investigation of dust models and the characteristics of dust on uv - wavelength radiation .",

    "<S> different wavelength regimes and methods for estimating the space density of the star - formation rate ( sfr ) result in discrepant values . </S>",
