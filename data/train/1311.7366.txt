    "this statement is especially valid for testing ep in case of a quantum motion of antiatoms .",
    "detailed studies of gravitational properties of antimatter are planned by most groups involved in experiments with antihydrogen ( @xmath0 ) @xcite .    here",
    "we discuss a possibility of exploring gravitational states of @xmath0 @xcite with potentially very precise spectroscopic methods .",
    "we study the behaviour of @xmath0 bounded in the gravitational field near a material surface under the influence of alternating magnetic field , with the frequency adjusted to induce resonance transitions between lowest gravitational states .",
    "this approach gives access to the gravitational energy level spacing and thus to the gravitational mass of @xmath0 .",
    "in this section we will study a motion of an @xmath0 atom , localized in the gravitational state near a horizontal plane mirror , under the influence of the alternating magnetic field .",
    "the interaction of magnetic field with _ a moving through the field _ ground state @xmath1 atom @xcite is dominated by interaction of an average magnetic moment of an atom @xcite in given hyperfine state with the magnetic field .",
    "we will focus on the alternating magnetic field with a gradient in the vertical direction .",
    "this condition is needed for coupling the field and the center of mass ( c.m ) @xmath0 motion in the gravitational field of the earth .",
    "it allows one to induce resonant transitions between quantum gravitational states of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "such states have similar properties with those , discovered for neutrons @xcite , in particular they are characterised by the following energy ( @xmath2 ) and spatial ( @xmath3 ) values : @xmath4{\\frac{\\hbar^2m^2g^2}{2 m } } \\left(\\lambda_n+\\delta \\right),\\\\ & h_n&=\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2mmg } } \\lambda_n , \\label { hn } \\\\ & \\mathop{\\rm ai}(&-\\lambda_n)=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath5 is the gravitational mass of @xmath0 , @xmath6 is the inertial mass of @xmath0 ( we distinguish between @xmath5 and @xmath6 in view of discussing ep test ) , @xmath7 is a gravitational field intensity near the earth surface , @xmath8 is an airy function @xcite , @xmath9 is a universal complex shift of gravitational levels due to the interaction with a material ( perfectly conducting ) wall @xcite .",
    "all the states acquire equal width depending on material surface substance @xmath10{\\frac{\\hbar^2m^2g^2}{2m}}|\\delta|$ ] .",
    "this width corresponds to the lifetime of @xmath11 s in case of a perfectly conducting surface and is twice larger for silica @xcite .",
    "we will consider the magnetic field in the form : @xmath12    here @xmath13 is an amplitude of a constant , vertically aligned , component of magnetic field , @xmath14 is the value of magnetic field gradient , @xmath15 is a distance measured in a vertical direction , @xmath16 is a distance measured in horizontal direction , parallel to a surface of a mirror .    time - varying magnetic field ( [ magn1 ] ) is accompanied with an electric field ( @xmath17=-\\frac{1}{c } \\partial \\vec{b}/\\partial t$ ] ) .",
    "however , for the ultracold atom velocities , corresponding interaction terms are small and thus will be omitted .",
    "inhomogeneous magnetic field couples the spin and spatial degrees of freedom .",

    "the meaning of the interaction terms is the following .",

    "we will treat only @xmath0 atoms in a @xmath33-state ( below we will show that excitation of other states in a studied process is improbable ) .",
    "the term @xmath34 is a model operator , which effectively accounts for the hyperfine interaction and reproduces the hyperfine energy splitting correctly .",
    "the term @xmath35 describes the field - magnetic moment interaction : @xmath36 here @xmath37 and @xmath38 are magnetic moments of positron and antiproton respectively .",
    "as far as the field @xmath39 changes spatially and temporally , this term couples the spin and the c.m . motion .",
    "we will assume that in typical conditions of a spectroscopy experiment @xmath0 velocity @xmath40 parallel to the mirror surface ( directed along @xmath16-axis ) is of order of a few @xmath41 and is much larger than a typical vertical velocity in lowest gravitational states ( which is of order of @xmath42 ) .",
    "we will treat motion in a frame moving with the velocity @xmath40 of the @xmath0 atom along the mirror surface .",
    "thus we will consider the x - component motion as a classical motion with a given velocity @xmath40 and will substitute @xmath16-dependence by @xmath21-dependence .",
    "we will also assume that @xmath43 , where @xmath44 cm is a typical size of an experimental installation of interest .",
    "this condition is needed for `` freezing '' the magnetic moment of an atom along the vertical direction ; it provides the maximum transition probability",
    ".    we will be interested in the weak field case , such that the zeeman splitting is much smaller than the hyperfine level spacing @xmath45 .",
    "the hierarchy of all mentioned above interaction terms can be formulated as follows : @xmath46 and thus it assumes using the adiabatic expansion for solving eq.([schr ] ) ; it is based on the fact that an internal state of an @xmath0 atom follows adiabatically the spatial and temporal variations of external magnetic field . neglecting non - adiabatic coupling , an equation system for the amplitude @xmath47 of a gravitational state @xmath48 has the form : @xmath49 transition frequency @xmath50 is determined by gravitational energy level spacing .",
    "this fact is used in the proposed approach to access gravitational level spacing by scanning the applied field frequency , as will be explained in the following .    in this formalism",
    "the role of the coupling potential @xmath51 is played by the energy of an atom in a fixed hyperfine state thought of as a function of ( slowly varying ) distance @xmath15 and time @xmath21 . @xmath52",
    "the gravitational state wave - function is given by the airy function @xcite .",
    "energy @xmath53 is the eigenvalue of internal and magnetic interactions @xmath54 , where the c.m .",
    "coordinate @xmath18 and time @xmath21 are treated as slow - changing parameters .",
    "corresponding expressions for eigen - energies of a @xmath33 manifold are :    @xmath55    subscripts @xmath56 are standard notations for hyperfine states of a @xmath33 manifold in the magnetic field .",
    "the presence of constant field @xmath13 produces the zeeman splitting between states @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "as far as energy of states @xmath59 depend on magnetic field linearly , while for states @xmath60 it depends quadratically , only transition between @xmath59 states take place in case of a week field . in the following",
    "we will consider only transitions between gravitational states in a @xmath61 manifold .",
    "qualitative behavior of the transition probability is given by the rabbi formula , which can be deduced by neglecting high frequency terms compared to resonance couplings of only two states , initial @xmath62 and final @xmath63 , in case the field frequency @xmath64 is close to the transition frequency @xmath65 : @xmath66 the factor @xmath67 appears in front of the right - hand side of the above expression due to the fact that only two @xmath68 of four hyperfine states participate in magnetically induced transitions .",
    "it is important that the transition frequencies @xmath69 do not depend on the antiatom - surface interaction up to the second order in @xmath70 .",
    "this is a consequence of the already mentioned fact that all energies of gravitational states acquire equal ( complex ) shift due to the interaction with a material surface .    a resonant spectroscopy of @xmath0 gravitational states could consist in observing @xmath0 atoms localized in the gravitational field above a material surface at a certain height as a function of the applied magnetic field frequency .",

    "second , @xmath0 atoms are affected by alternating magnetic field ( [ magn1 ] ) while moving parallel to the mirror . an excited gravitational state is resonantly populated .",
    "third , the number of @xmath0 atoms in an excited state is measured by means of counting annihilation events in a detector placed at a height @xmath74 above the mirror .",
    "the value of @xmath74 is chosen to be larger , than the spatial size of the gravitational ground state and smaller than the spatial size of the final state ( [ hn ] ) , @xmath75 , so that the ground state atoms pass through , while atoms in the excited state are detected .",
    "we present a simulation of the number of detected annihilation events as a function of the field frequency in fig.[figtrans ] for the transition from the ground to the @xmath76-th excited state , based on numerical solution of equation system eq.([adiab ] ) .",
    "corresponding resonance transition frequency is @xmath77 hz . the value of the field gradient , optimized to obtain the maximum probability of @xmath78 transition during the time of flight @xmath79 s , turned to be equal @xmath80 gs / m , the corresponding guiding field value , which guarantees adiabaticity of the magnetic moment motion , is @xmath81 gs .    -th gravitational state.,width=377 ]    it follows from ( [ egrav ] ) that the @xmath0 gravitational mass could be deduced from the measured transition frequency @xmath82 as follows : @xmath83    let us mention that in the above formula @xmath7 means the _ gravitational field intensity _ near the earth surface , a value which characterizes properties of field and is assumed to be known with a high precision . at the same time all the information about gravitational properties of @xmath0 is included in the gravitational mass @xmath5 .",
    "equality of the gravitational mass @xmath5 and the inertial mass @xmath6 , imposed by the equivalence principle , results in the following expression : @xmath84    assuming that the spectral line width is determined by the lifetime @xmath85 s of gravitational states , we estimate that the gravitational mass @xmath5 can be deduced with the relative accuracy @xmath86 for @xmath87 annihilation events for the transition to the @xmath76-th state .",

    "we study main properties of the interaction of gravitationally bound @xmath0 with magnetic field and find the probabilities of resonance transitions from ground to excited states . in the proposed approach",
    "the number of annihilation events is countered as a function of the applied field frequency .",
    "the spatial positioning of the annihilation detector at a height , corresponding to the classical turning point of the second gravitational state ensures that only @xmath0 atoms in the final state are detected .",
