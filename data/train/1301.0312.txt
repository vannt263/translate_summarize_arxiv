    ", in the film geometry , there appears a first - order phase transition between these states , which forms a line ( ccl ) ending at a film critical point outside the bulk coexistence curve in the @xmath3-@xmath6 plane @xcite , where @xmath6 is the reservoir chemical potential @xcite .",
    "we call it the capillary condensation transition even for binary mixtures , though this name has been used for the gas - liquid phase transition in porous media @xcite . around ccl ,",

    "then , the dynamics is one - dimensional in an early stage but the fluid flow in the lateral directions accelerates the late - stage coarsening even under the no - slip boundary condition on the walls @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , porcheron and monson @xcite numerically studied the dynamics of extrusion and intrusion of liquid mercury between a cylindrical pore and a reservoir .",
