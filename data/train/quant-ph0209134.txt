    "scattering of atoms by a resonant standing light wave is one of the basic phenomena of the atom optics .",
    "the number of publications on this subject is huge ( see , e.g. , the books @xcite and the references therein ) . a very special place in this field belongs to a series of works on atoms with a wide excited resonance level , the width of which is determined mainly by spontaneous radiative transitions to nonresonant atomic levels @xcite .",
    "realizability of such a scheme was demonstrated in the experiment @xcite .",
    "ar * atoms were prepared initially in a metastable state @xmath0 ( @xmath1_2 $ ] state , correspondingly , in the paschen and standard spectroscopic notations @xcite ) . in the experiment , the resonant light field of the wavelength",
    "801 nm coupled the level @xmath2 with the excited level @xmath3 , which corresponded to the state @xmath4_2 $ ] .",
    "70% of its width was determined by transitions to levels different from @xmath2 and , finally , to the ground level @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "1 ) . in principle , in ar * there is another transition , @xmath6 , in which 98% of the width of the excited level is determined by spontaneous decay to levels different from @xmath2 @xcite . in any case , for both transitions the model of a two - level system with a wide excited level decaying predominantly to levels different from the metastable one works reasonably well .",
    "this is the model to be considered in this work .",
    "both in the experiment @xcite and , most often , in the theory @xcite , the investigated regimes of scattering corresponded to the weak - scattering bragg regime .",
    "this means that the atomic - beam incidence angle was close or equal to the bragg angle and the resonance coupling was not too strong . in terms of the rabi frequency @xmath7 and the width of the excited level @xmath8",
    ", the last assumption implies that @xmath9 . in this case , the decay dynamics of an atomic system was shown to obey the usual exponential law @xcite . under some special conditions",
    "the effects like population trapping were predicted to take place @xcite .",
    "but , again , the residual atomic population was shown to approach its asymptotic non - zero level exponentially @xcite .    in this work",
    "we will investigate the dynamics of spontaneous decay in the system under consideration at different conditions .",
    "first , we will consider the case of strong rabi coupling , @xmath10 and @xmath11 . and , second , we will consider the case of normal ( or almost normal ) incidence of atoms upon the standing wave .",
    "this is the diffraction regime of scattering , in which many diffraction maxima can arise from the initially well collimated atomic beam .    by investigating the decay dynamics in such a regime",
    "we find that the total time - dependent populations of both metastable and excited levels fall non - exponentially .",
    "in contrast to standard predictions , the atomic populations are characterized by power - law dependencies on the interaction time @xmath12 .",
    "the effect is not connected with formation of any kind of grey or dark states ( as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) because asymptotically , at very long time , atomic populations tend to zero .",
    "but , owing to scattering , the radiative decay appears to be slowed down .",
    "in addition , we find that in atoms scattered by a standing light wave the rabi oscillations of atomic populations appear to be strongly suppressed compared to a pure two - level system in a resonance field .",
    "the physical interpretation of these effects is given .",

    "we will consider only the resonance case , when the light frequency equals the energy spacing between some two discrete nondegenerate atomic levels , @xmath3 and @xmath2 , @xmath29 .",
    "we assume that @xmath2 and @xmath3 are , respectively , an infinitely narrow metastable and a wide excited atomic levels , and the width @xmath8 of the excited level is determined predominantly by its spontaneous decay to the ground atomic level ( inset of fig .",

    "so , the main predictions of the carried out consideration are ( i ) suppression of the rabi oscillations in the case of atom scattering ( compared to a pure two - level system ) and ( ii ) slowing down the radiative decay and formation of nonexponential ( power - law ) tails in the dependencies @xmath207 . qualitatively , our interpretation of these effects consists of the following .",
    "the rabi oscillations are suppressed owing to inhomogeneous - broadening - like effects when the partial probabilities of scattering are summed over the diffractions beams .",
    "the power - law dependencies and slowing down of the radiative decay arise because of the position - dependent modulation of the field - strength amplitude in a standing light wave and , hence , the position - dependent modulation of the decay rate of slowly decaying quasienergy atomic levels @xmath78 . as the result , of this modulation the manifold of the arising quasienergy levels is characterized by continuously varying with @xmath22 and approaching zero at @xmath208 width .",
    "populations at these quasienergy levels decrease exponentially but with different , @xmath22-dependent rates , and their superposition gives rise to the non - exponential decay laws .",
    "we assume that observation of these effects can be made in the framework of an experiment similar to @xcite though with some modifications , to provide the conditions for the strong rabi coupling and the normal - incidence diffraction regime of scattering . to compare directly the time evolution of atomic populations in atoms scattered by a standing light wave and in a pure two - level system",
    ", one can make two series of similar measurements : in a standing light wave and in a single travelling wave of a doubled field strength amplitude . in the last case",
    "the standing - wave scattering effects disappear and the large - amplitude rabi oscillations and the usual exponential decay have to be observed .    finally , the above - described scattering - induced suppression of the radiative decay in the case of strong rabi coupling reminds the effect of interference stabilization in rydberg atoms in a strong light field @xcite , @xcite . in both cases the effects of slowing down the decay processes are related to formation of narrow quasienergy levels and interference of transitions from different levels to the common continuum .",
    "we find this analogy important because it establishes links between different regions of physical phenomena and demonstrates a rather general character and fruitfulness of the idea of interference stimulated by sufficiently strong interactions .",
