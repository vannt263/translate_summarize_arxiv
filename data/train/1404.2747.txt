    "the general relativistic two - body problem has become of renewed importance in view of the current development of gravitational - wave detectors .",
    "it is plausible that the first detections will concern binary systems made of _ spinning _ black holes , because the spin - orbit interaction can increase the binding energy of the last stable ( circular ) orbit , and thereby lead to a larger gravitational wave output .",
    "this gives a strong incentive for improving our analytic knowledge of the gravitational spin - orbit interaction in binary systems .",
    "several analytical - relativity methods are currently being actively pursued : post - newtonian ( pn ) theory @xcite , gravitational self - force ( gsf ) theory in black hole backgrounds @xcite , and the effective - one - body ( eob ) formalism @xcite .",
    "recent years have witnessed a useful synergy between these methods , with information flowing between them ( and flowing also from the results of full numerical relativity simulations ) @xcite .",
    "the present work will show another instance of such a synergy between analytical methods : we consider a binary system where a body having a small mass @xmath1 and a small spin @xmath2 moves on a circular orbit of radius @xmath3 and orbital frequency @xmath4 around a non - spinning body having a large mass @xmath5 .",
    "we shall start by using analytic gsf theory @xcite to compute to linear order in the mass ratio @xmath6 , the spin - orbit coupling @xmath7 of particle 1 , which is equivalent to knowing the spin precession @xmath8 of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the gsf result for @xmath8 ( considered as a function of @xmath4 ) will be expanded to high order in a pn expansion , by using the same technology that we recently used @xcite to derive the pn expansion of detweiler s redshift function @xcite .",
    "the latter pn - expanded result will then be transcribed within the eob formalism in terms of higher order contributions to one of the two ( gauge - invariant ) effective gyro - gravitomagnetic ratios ( @xmath9 ) characterizing spin - orbit couplings within the eob formalism .",
    "in addition , we shall compare our results to a recent work by dolan et al .",
    "@xcite which has provided both an analytical gsf derivation of @xmath8 and numerical data on the strong - field behavior of the first - order gsf contribution to @xmath8 . we shall find that our new high pn - order results on @xmath8 are able to capture strong - field features that are beyond the reach of the currently available low pn - order ones .",
    "detweiler @xcite has emphasized the usefulness of computing gauge - invariant quantities from gsf theory .",
    "he pointed out that ( quasi-)circular orbits provide a calculable gauge - invariant function @xmath10 via the existence of a helical killing vector [ 1.1 ] k^_=_t + _ .",
    "the function @xmath10 relates the norm @xmath11 of @xmath12 [ computed with the regularized perturbed metric @xmath13 @xcite , and evaluated along the world line @xmath14 of particle 1 ] , [ 1.2 ] |k|^2=-[g_^r k^k^]_1 , to the orbital frequency @xmath4 of the considered circular motion .",
