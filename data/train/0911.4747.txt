    "to understand the physical conditions of o and b stars and their immediate environments there can be no better mode of study than high - dispersion ultraviolet spectroscopy . the spectral energy distributions of hot stars peak in this regime , and",
    "it is also here that absorption lines arising from a wide range of excited atomic states appear in high concentration .",
    "these lines provide a rich and rather unexplored area for the study of markers of atmospheric temperature , pressure , kinematics , and chemical composition .",
    "in addition , atoms undergoing far - uv transitions  see \" down to deep layers of the atmosphere because of the local relative transparency .",
    "the resulting intense uv radiation field is responsible for creating departures from lte in these transitions and influencing the calibration of spectral diagnostics .",
    "once atmospheres of single hot stars are understood , this knowledge can be extended to the interpretation of spectra of distant ensembles of hot stars and star formation regions .",
    "at about the turn of this century the era dawned in which specific far - uv spectral lines observed in ob clusters embedded in highly redshifted galaxies can be studied from the ground at optical wavelengths ( e.g. , de mello 2000 et al .",
    ", pettini et al .",

    "2003 , shapley et al .",
    "2003 , de mello et al . 2004 ) .",
    "in the two decades leading up to and including this milestone , enormous progress was made in understanding the atmospheres and origin of ob stars .",
    "first came high - resolution spectroscopic observations of the middle - uv during the extended period ( 1978 - 1996 ) of the _ international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) _ satellite .",
    "next , the 1999 launch of the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) , _ brought access to the far - uv for hundreds of hot stars in the milky way and magellanic clouds .",
    "this era of grand exploration and surveys closed with the decommissioning of _ fuse _ in 2007 .",
    "the final reprocessing of the _ fuse _ spectra ( covering the wavelength region 920   to 1188 ) now permits the examination of a wealth of homogeneous high - quality material .    for o and b stars one consolidation of these gains was the addition of a fine set of middle - uv and far - uv spectral atlases .",
    "examples of the former are the _ copernicus _ atlas of @xmath0sco ( rogerson et al . 1977 ) and _",
    "iue _ pictorial atlases of o and b stars ( walborn , nichols - bohlin , & panek 1985 , rountree & sonneborn 1993 , walborn , parker , & nichols 1995 ) .",
    "pellerin et al .",
    "( 2002 ) inaugurated a second group of digitized atlases with their atlases of o and early - b type stars of all luminosity classes .",
    "this work had the goal of exhibiting the general behavior of the strong photospheric lines and the so called uv wind lines with effective temperature t@xmath2 and luminosity class .",
    "valuable supplemental information about the molecular h@xmath1 lines formed in the interstellar medium ( ism ) was also provided . from the point of view of stellar researchers , these features contaminate many of the far - uv photospheric lines of most galactic stars .",
    "this atlas was closely followed by a second spectral atlas on ob stars in the two magellanic clouds by the same group ( walborn et al .",
    "this work concentrated on the behavior of wind lines with respect to metallicity as well as temperature and luminosity .",
    "in addition to these atlases , blair et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have published a compendium of _ fuse _ spectra of hot stars in the magellanic clouds .",
    "this atlas focused on the identification of far - uv resonance lines arising from the ism that are sometimes found at multiple velocities .",
    "specialized atlases are now underway for the purposes of displaying the behavior of specific elements in particular types of stars . for example , an atlas depicting lines of heavy metal elements in _ iue _ spectra of late - b and early b stars has recently been published by adelman et al . (",
    "2004 ) .    the first far - uv high - dispersion spectral coverage published for a b star was the _ copernicus _ atlas of @xmath0scorpii ( b0.2v ; walborn 1971 ) by rogerson & upson ( 1977 ;  ru77 \" ) .",
    "rogerson & ewell ( 1985 ;  re85 \" ) published a detailed tabulation of photospheric and ism lines identified in this atlas .",
    "the re85 work was undertaken at a time when spectral synthesis tools were not commonly available , and when reliable identifications lay in the hands of a comparative handful of experienced spectroscopists who were also specialists in atomic physics .",
    "even so , in the absence of commonly available spectral syntheses programs at that time , it was difficult to make wholesale line identifications without significant numbers of errors .",
    "this situation has changed dramatically in the intervening years with the development of spectral line synthesis tools that make use of extensive atomic line libraries ( as well as the organization of the line libraries themselves ) .    inspired by the _ copernicus _",
    "atlas , we decided to address the need for the identification of lines in high - dispersion far - uv spectra along the b main sequence .",
    "thus , the first goal of our work is to select and provide far - uv spectral data for main sequence b0 to b9 stars .",
    "the atlas spectra should be sharp - lined enough to permit the resolution of a majority of dominant individual atmospheric lines and to provide spectral data products in a common , continuous - spectrum format ranging in wavelength from near the short - wavelength limit of the _ fuse _ regime to the red wing ( 1225 ) of lyman@xmath3 .",
    "such an assemblage requires not only the cojoining of all _ fuse _ spectral detector segments but also ( for b0 ) of second - order scans of _",
    "copernicus s _  u1 \" multiplier , and echelle spectra from _ iue _ or the _ hubble space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis)_. this is necessary to extend our coverage from the _ fuse _ long - wavelength limit of 1188   to 1225 , as justified below .",
    "our second goal is to choose three spectra among our atlas sample that capture the low , high , and midpoints of the excitation range of ions in b star atmospheres and to identify all possible absorption lines that make a noticeable contribution to these spectra according to published atomic line libraries .",
    "this addition changes the emphasis of the atlas from the classical high - level montage presentation to a  detailed \" attribution of the spectral features .",
    "our third goal is to discuss those metallic lines identified from the second goal in the context of diagnostics of effective temperature , luminosity , and heavy element abundances .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the selection of spectra and the methodology for data conditioning and line identification are set forth in @xmath42 .",
    "section @xmath43 displays portions of the atlas and a detailed list of all ( several thousand ) of our line identifications as well as a list of  clean \" lines across much of the b - star domain .",
    "we also discuss an example of the important ciii 1176   region used as a temperature diagnostic for this spectral type . in @xmath44",
    "we give relevant statistics from our identifications for the b0 , b2 , and b8 exemplars we call spectral templates .",
    "we provide a comparison of our results with an earlier critique of the rogerson & ewell ( 1985 ) line attributions for the @xmath0sco atlas .",
    "we finally give commentary on a number of possible spectral markers for physical conditions in these stars atmospheres .",
    "the primary purpose of this atlas is to provide a continuous spectrum from 930   to 1225   of every spectral subtype of a galactic b - type star near the main sequence .",
    "this means that the atlas is based largely but not exclusively on _ fuse _ spectra , a requirement introduces some complications because it necessitates that data from other instruments be used for coverage beyond the long - wavelength limit of _ fuse _ at 1188 .",
    "this in turn imposes changes at this wavelength in instrumental sampling , resolution , and , most important of all , a shift to a spectrum of a second star that often reflects slightly different physical properties .",
    "our rationale for extending the atlas wavelength coverage is , first , that we wanted to bridge the broad  middle uv \" and  far - uv \" regimes empirically defined by the coverages of _ iue _ and _ fuse _ ultraviolet explorer missions .",
    "one may define this bridge region in practice as the interval between the long - wavelength limit of _ fuse _ coverage and 1225 - 6 ,   where the roll - off in sensitivity at short wavelengths commences for the _ iue _ short wavelength ( swp ) camera .",
    "second , our aim is to include the lyman @xmath3 line , which along with higher lyman members covered by the _ fuse _ detectors , is an important ingredient in determining the radiative and thermal equilibria of a star s atmosphere and thus its physical structure .",
    "note that the innermost 6 - 8 ngstroms in the lyman @xmath3 lines are dominated by an ism component in spectra of b stars located in the galactic plane ( e.g. , bohlin 1975 ) .",
    "thus by extending atlas coverage to 1225   we can ensure coverage of photospheric lines on both sides of the lyman @xmath3 line core .",
    "important spectral diagnostics of temperature and ionization are also included in this region , including sometimes strong resonance lines of siiii ( 1206 ) and siii ( 1193 - 1194 ) .",
    "finally , the identification of metallic lines in this region may help distinguish spectral lines formed in atmospheres in stars embedded in redshifted galaxies from those of the local hydrogenic lyman forest .",
    "the selection of atlas stars required that the spectra have high signal - to - noise ratios and exhibit sharp and single lines .",
    "whenever possible , they must also represent normal ( solar - like ) photospheric abundances and not suffer much ism absorption ( in practice this means e@xmath5 @xmath6 0.4 ) . to find suitable far - uv spectra we combed through all b - type iii - v class material in the mast/_fuse _ archive and identified stars with sharp - lined spectra .",
    "for coverage above the long - wavelength limit of _ fuse _ spectra , we included spectra from either the _ iue _ or hst/_stis _ archive . to follow the discussion on specific stars below , the reader is referred to the final list of our selected atlas stars in table1 . as a unique case , and being sharp - lined and bright , the star @xmath0scorpii is a ",
    "ready made \" representative of type b0v .",
    "( note , however , that its wavelength coverage starts at 948.7 , and not 930 , ngstroms .",
    "we also note that wavelength corrections have been introduced following an erratum in the original rogerson & upson paper . ) for other stars we inspected spectral previews of several hundred stars and in some instances the fits data themselves to make nine additional selections .",
    "spectral types were taken from the skiff ( 2007 ) catalog , which in the case of multiple assignments fortunately showed at most a small range in range of estimated spectral subtypes .",
    "our star selections required a few compromises .",
    "notably , both of our latest type stars , hd182308 and hd62714 , have peculiar abundances .",
    "hd182308 has been variously classified as b8v ( floquet 1970 ) and b9p(hg)mn ( cowley 1968 ) .",
    "a detailed inspection of its far - uv line strengths confirms that this star s atmosphere has anomalous abundances consistent with the hgmn class class of peculiar b stars .",
    "hd62714 has been classified as b9/b9.5heb7vp : ( houk & cowley 1975 ) . because we noticed that some far - uv lines of chromium or manganese appeared anomalous in strength , the classifications of these two stars as chemically peculiar seems appropriate . for purposes of this atlas",
    ", we designated hd182308 as b8vp and hd62714 as b9vp . with these exceptions to our stipulated ideal criteria , we list the star selections for this far - uv spectral atlas in table1 .",
    "the ordering of stars in this table was facilitated by the progression with spectral subtype of the important ciii 1176   complex ( see discussion in @xmath4[node1176 ] ) , strengths of a few fe - line ( principally complexes ) , as well as the effective temperatures reported by kilian ( 1994 ; for @xmath0sco ) , glagolevskij ( 1994 ) , by t@xmath2 values determined by fitzpatrick & massa ( 1999 ) and morel & butler ( 2006 ) , and by the @xmath7 temperature calibration of b stars of napiwotzki , schoenbrunner & wenske ( 1993 ) .",
    "our selections left an unfilled gap in our spectral subtypes at b7 .",
    "however , this gap in t@xmath2 is rather small as the temperatures of the hd182308 and hd62714 both seem to be slightly high for stars having these spectral subtypes .",
    "reddening ( e(b - v ) ) values , which generally correlate with ism column density , are taken from several sources in the literature .",
    "values for the bright stars we used for  adjunct \" ( @xmath81188 ) spectra , are @xmath9 0.10 .",
    "panchromatic data from the same instrument ( _ copernicus _ ) were available for only one star , @xmath0sco . for the other spectral types we used observations for the same star both below and above 1188   wherever possible .",
    "however , as noted in @xmath42.1 , we were obliged to provide this extension by using coadded echelle _ iue _",
    "spectra for another star of virtually the same spectral type in the following cases : for type b1 ( @xmath10cma ) , b2 ( @xmath11peg ) , b2-b3 ( @xmath12cas ) , b3-b4 ( @xmath13her ) , and b8p - b8 ( @xmath14oct . ) for b5 ( hd94144 ) , b6v ( hd30122 ) , and ( b9p ) hd62714 echelle _ stis _ spectra were utilized .",
    "because the temperature of our b1 star hd113012 is already nearly as high as @xmath0sco ( and to exclude it from the atlas would risk instead adopting another spectrum with much broader lines ) , it was expedient to use _ copernicus _ of @xmath0sco a second time to extend the coverage of hd113012 for the limited range 1188   to 1225.sco for type b0.5 . ] the details of the adjunct spectra are noted as parenthesized , second - line entries in table1 .",
    " final \" data reprocessings of _ iue _ and _ stis _ echelle spectra were completed in 1997 and 2006 , respectively .",
    "( the recent refurbishment of the hst by the space shuttle atlantis ensure a new generation of stis data will follow . )",
    "the _ fuse _ data were reprocessed with calfuse version 3.2 ( dixon et al .",
    "2007 ) during 2007 - 8 .",
    "these spectra were ingested into the mast archive , and we retrieved them from this facility .",
    "the _ fuse _ spacecraft utlized four independent telescopes and spectrographs .",
    "paraphrasing the _ fuse archival instrument handbook _ ( kaiser & kruk 2009 ) , each of the telescopes illuminated its own holographic diffraction grating / camera mounted on a rowland circle spectrograph and fed light to one of two far - uv microchannel plate detectors that illuminated two microchannel plate detectors via lif and sic coated mirrors .",
    "each of the detectors recorded spectra from a pair of these optical channels , one each from focused a camera mirror coated with lif or sic and therefore optimized for a limited wavelength range . nearly complete far - uv coverage of the spectrum is provided by two nearly identical  sides \" of the instrument , each of which includes two pairs of lif and sic detectors .",
    "flux at almost all wavelengths is recorded by at least two segments ( the region 1015 - 1075   is covered in four segments ) .",
    "table2 lists in italics the coverages of each of the _ fuse _ detector segments . both _",
    "iue _ and _ hst / stis _ data were obtained through large science apertures with an echelle grating optimized for high orders .",
    "references for this instrument and data processing are given , respectively , in garhart et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and kim quijano et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .    the spectral resolutions ( full width half maxima ) of these spectra , as taken from ru77 or the cited data handbooks are as follows : _ copernicus _ 12 - 15 kms@xmath15 , _ fuse _ 15 kms@xmath15 , _ stis _ 12 - 15 kms@xmath15 , and _ iue _ 30 kms@xmath15 .",
    "thus , the resolution of these instruments is approximately matched to the rotational broadening criterion we imposed in our star selection .",
    "the conditioning steps for _ fuse _ data were comparatively more complex , first , because of the well known nonlinear excursions of the wavelength scale .",
    "these effects are largely due to electron repulsion in the detector that can distort the faithful deposition of photoelectrons .",
    "such excursions are typically not robust with time and can not be modeled reliably .",
    "in addition to this , systematic shifts due to the positioning of the star image in a large science aperture are present .",
    "a third problem is the presence of optical vignetting (  worms \" ) across the detector field that caused artificial and uncharacterizable depressions in certain detector segments , particularly the lif 1b segment ( see chapter  4 of the fuse instrument handbook ; kaiser & kruk 2009 ) . because several instrumental idiosyncracies appear in _ fuse",
    "_ detector sides 1 and 2 spectra , most researchers have learned to work with the segments of these two sides separately and compare them in the end as if they were independent observations .",
    "we will do the same here , as we describe the steps to our building two cojoined spectra from the 4 detector segment pairs .    in almost all cases",
    "multiple exposures had been taken of our target stars .",
    "therefore , for each of the eight detector segments our first conditioning steps were to cross - correlate to the nearest pixel , co - weight , and add the individual spectral exposures .",
    "coweighting was implemented by means of a simple",
    "pixel - to - pixel fluctuation metric used to compute signal - to - noise ratios ( stoehr 2007 ) . in this coweighting step",
    "we omitted any spectra ( e.g. , resulting from incorrect pointings ) with weights less than @xmath16 the of the maximum weighted observation .",
    "visual inspection then verified that all spectra had been shifted to the nearest pixel of the fiducial ( first ) observation in the series .    except for linear interpolation over subpixel scales noted below , our only modifications to the fluxes were to substantially remove the flux depression due to the worm in the region from 1130   to 1160   of the lif 1b segment .",
    "this was done by passing a high order filter having the same degree over the 1b and 2a segment fluxes and then interpolating to the original pixel scale .",
    "the 1b worm was  removed \" by dividing of the 2a spectrum polynomial fit by the 1b fit in the wavelength region affected by the worm and applying the quotient to the original 1b spectrum .",
    "it was necessary to devote considerable attention to our correction of the wavelength scale .",
    "the raw wavelengths exhibits frequent departures of 0.03   or larger from linearity over occasionally even a few ngstroms .",
    "this was accomplished by first determining a trial linear wavelength calibration ( generally , by a small , and always subpixel , shift of the spectrum ) to match computed lyman and werner transitions from a single rotational state of the zeroth vibrational level to the ground state of molecular h@xmath1 lines in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the parameters of these transitions were provided by an on - line tool created as part of the  h2ools \" project ( mccandliss 2003 ) .",
    "this tool allowed us to identify these molecular ism features in all our spectra and and to coplot them on a common wavelength scale .",
    "our procedures permitted us to detect wavelength scale nonlinearities and correct them by imposing shifts on a subpixel scale ( 0.01 ) over adjacent wavelength segments to bring the observations into conformity with the theoretical h@xmath1 line  comb . \"",
    "this procedure was repeated for all segments of the two _ fuse _ detector sides .",
    "( we caution the reader than some departures over small wavelength regions as large as @xmath17   may yet exist , although we have tried to correct them all . ) as a last step for conditioning _ fuse _ data , we corrected the wavelengths for the most recent stellar radial velocity tabulated in simbad .",
    "the final spectra were resampled linearly to the original uniform mesh of the original observations , which for _ fuse _ is 0.013   pixel@xmath15 . the long wavelength ( @xmath81188 ) sampling is 0.031",
    "pixel@xmath15 for _ iue , _ and 0.0052   pixel@xmath15 for _ stis_. the wavelength spacing for the far - uv region of the _ copernicus _ atlas is about 0.022    pixel@xmath15 .",
    "the original wavelengths and counts from ru77 were used in our re - presentation of their atlas .",
    "next we cojoined the spectra , both below the demarcation wavelength 1188   ( fuse ) and above it . the first step consisted of cojoining the side 1 spectra , consisting of segments",
    "sic1b , lif1a , sic1a , lif2a and lif1b ( where lif2a was used to plug a 4ngstrom gap in the side 1 coverage ) .",
    "we spliced these segments at wavelengths where no conspicuous lines are present in our template b0 , b2 , or b8 spectra .",
    "the wavelengths of the _ fuse _ spectra are given within parentheses in table2 .",
    "the spectra for each of the two _ fuse _ sides are cojoined with the _ iue _ or _ stis _ spectra , preserving the original uniform wavelength spacings and adopting a scale factor for the long wavelength spectrum that provides a continuity in flux across the 1188   demarcation .    as an aid to users of the atlas data",
    ", we denote those wavelengths for which ism lines have important contributions , particularly for the atomic and molecular hydrogen features in the spectrum that can be contaminated by absorptions from interstellar gas .",
    "these lines often merge together in aggregates covering a few ngstroms .",
    "we located these wavelength regions by selecting a high - quality spectrum with a mixture of broad photospheric and contrasting sharp ism lines .",
    "we used a coaddition of 71 _ fuse _ exposures of hd195965 ( b0v ; e@xmath5@xmath18 + 0.41 ; sasseen et al .",
    "2002 ) as an ism line template .",
    "we modified the ranges of the spectra for each of the atlas stars and forced the ism - dominated windows to be the same between pairs of spectral segments covering the same wavelength ranges .",
    "as a last step in constructing spectra over broad wavelengths , we spliced _",
    "iue _ and _ stis _ echelle order segments to the segment - merged _ fuse _ spectra .",
    "splice points were selected at wavelengths where the local noise fluctuations of the neighboring orders were approximately equal .",
    "for the _ iue _ spectral spectments we made splice points at 1188.0 , 1192.5 , 1205.5 , 1215.5 , and 1225.0 .   for _ stis _ the splice points were more closely spaced , about every 3.5 ,   again starting at 1188.0 .",
    "we selected as templates , that is representatives from which to identify lines over the b spectral range , the spectra of @xmath0sco ( b0 ) , hd37367 ( b2 ) , and hd182308 ( b8p ) .",
    "we chose hd182308 rather than the cooler hd62714 because the lines of hd182308 are narrower .",
    "we used an effective temperature of 13,100k to compute synthetic spectra for our cool - star template as this is close to the mean of the t@xmath2 values of these two cool stars ( table1 ) . likewise , because the lines of @xmath0sco are among the narrowest of any nearby early b star , we chose this as our representative b0 type . despite the uncalibrated nature of its linearized fluxes , the spectral resolution and signal - to - noise ratio , of the _ copernicus _ spectrum rival or exceed the quality of the _ fuse _ material .",
    "we determined from our spectral synthesis model tool that the transition between the dominance of feiii lines to feii lines occurs at about 23,000k .",
    "this is about the expected surface temperature of a b2v star .",
    "accordingly , we chose the hd37367 spectrum as our middle - ionization template spectrum .",
    "we emphasize that the temperatures chosen for our three spectral templates serve only to identify observed lines and not fit them quantitatively .      to prepare for the identification of lines in our spectral templates , we compiled a line library from three sources : the kurucz ( 1993 ) line library , the vienna atomic line database (  vald \" ; piskunov et al .",
    "1995 , kupka et al .",
    "1999 ) , and the on - line atomic line database of van hoof ( 2006 ) .",
    "the kurucz line library has the advantage of being comprehensive and theoretical , meaning that its coverage is not compromised in the far - uv by absorptive optical coatings .",
    "however , this list has become dated .",
    "the vald and van hoof databases are periodically updated and both present a recommended oscillator strength ( log@xmath19 ) value for a line if more than one have been published . the vald library is supported by an interactive web form .",
    "the form allows the user to state the stellar effective temperature and a line depth threshold criterion , e.g. , 1% line depth , above which lines will be included in a returned list .",
    "we exercised this option , and chose t@xmath2 = 23,000k in our requests .",
    "the van hoof library is likewise extensive and is convenient to use on line , especially during our frequent manual cross - checking of best identifications .",
    "our library did not screen out lines of highly excited ions from the kurucz atlas contribution . for completeness",
    ", we note that howk et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have suggested empirical revisions to log@xmath19 s of several feii resonance lines in the range 1050   to 1150   on the basis of fittings of ism lines in _ fuse _ spectra .",
    "however , the corrections they recommend are generally within a factor of two of the log@xmath19 values in our assembled line library .",
    "such corrections have little bearing on the identification of saturated features and could be disregarded .",
    "we were able to combine these three line lists and excise duplicate entries listing the same ion and nearly the same wavelength and atomic level excitation .",
    "the latter actions were performed by a computer program . however , because the tolerated differences of wavelengths and excitations for the same line could vary by ion , some duplications were identified and excised/ manually . in cases of duplicate entries with the kurucz list",
    ", we exercised a preference for the van hoof or vald log@xmath19 s and wavelengths .",
    "all our line identifications were based on our now well defined line library , thereby requiring all these lines have either measured or published log@xmath19 values in the literature . in order to make line identifications we used a line annotation facility in the spectral line synthesis program ",
    "synspec of hubeny , lanz , and jeffery ( 1994 ) .",
    "this program can be run interactively to compute and plot spectral fluxes over a specified wavelength range once the user specifies key input parameters such as metallicity ( assumed to be solar ) , stellar effective temperature t@xmath2 , log@xmath20 , and microturbulence . in our models we used log@xmath20 = 4 and @xmath14 = 2 kms@xmath15 .",
    "the t@xmath2 values were models closest in integral kilokelvins to the numbers in table1 .",
    "we compared line synthesis results from standard kurucz ( 1990 ) and non - lte models calculated by tlusty from the so - called ",
    "b2006 \" grid ( lanz & hubeny 2007 ) .",
    "the line strengths produced from the two sets of models typically differed by amounts equivalent to a temperature change of 1,000k for models having a t@xmath2 appropriate to @xmath0sco and much smaller than this for a model appropriate to type b8 model . for the purposes of line identifications either set of models would serve just as well for the b8 model . in this case the low precision of log@xmath19 s far outweighs uncertainties in the atmospheric t(@xmath0 ) s in the computed line strengths .      in the last several years",
    "a few middle - uv spectral atlases have been published with annotations for most visible spectral lines ( e.g. , leckrone et al .",
    "we attempted as a key part of our  detailed atlas \" to extend this philosophy by identifying all atomic lines responsible for far - uv absorptions in b0 , b2 , and b8 main sequence spectra ( and presumably for subtypes in between ) .",
    "we set the short - wavelength limit of our identification list no shorter than at 949 ,   the starting wavelength of the re85 line list , because little purpose would be served by attempting to identify photospheric lines to the blue of this limit , where h and h@xmath1 lines blanketing dominates .",
    "the particular challenge faced in the far - uv is the blending of closely spaced lines that can not be resolved even in stars with rotational broadenings no larger than the _ iue _ instrumental width of about 30kms@xmath15 .",
    "our procedure was to compute spectral line models in narrow wavelength intervals , often no larger than 3 ngstroms , and to overplot the synthesis and the identifications provided by synspec .",
    "manual intervention was often required in the working version of the line list for the following reasons :    * some lines can not be identified with certainty according to their published log@xmath19 values .",
    "this is because some @xmath19s are too small and they underpredict the line strengths , just as others are too large .",
    "our procedure in such cases was first to seek the best candidate line , next to artificially increase its log@xmath19 by a factor of 30 in our working line list , and finally to rerun the _ synspec _ synthesis .",

    "we note that our line list also includes overpredicted lines , that is , identifications predicted from synspec with no visible counterparts in the observed spectrum .",
    "the construction of our line list proceeded after first putting into place semiautomated error checking procedures .",

    "this presentation of our  detailed atlas \" is different from that of most other atlases .",
    "typically , spectral atlases present a pictorial montage of all spectral types over the full wavelength range surveyed .",
    "our atlas consists of three core products : ( 1 ) extensive line identification lists , ( 2 ) a graphical plot of line identifications of the three template spectra and , ( 3 ) data files containing merged spectra in flexible image transport system ( fits ) format .",

    "our detailed line lists for the three b0 , b2 , and b8 template spectra are presented in table3 .",
    "the table is divided into three subpanels a - c .",
    "each subpanel first lists the star number for which a line has been identified (  1 , \"  2 , \" and  3 \" correspond to spectral types b0 , b2 , and b8 , respectively ) , then in two columns the identified wavelength from our line list sources , and finally the ion identification .",
    "the two wavelength columns represent _ either _ the  primary \" or  member \" ( secondary ) of a line group , respectively , such that one of the columns is always unfilled . here  group \" refers to a common resolution window in which the wavelength of the primary line is located .",

    "secondary group members follow their associated group primaries , even if the secondary s wavelength is slightly smaller than the primary s .",
    "a glance at the beginning of table3 suggests a trend that is indeed born out by the full listing across the whole far - uv range : 35 of the first short - wavelength lines on the first page are contained in the b0 spectrum .",
    "this same page contains only 17 lines identified for the b8 star .",

    "a series of amorphous ci lines , largely formed in the photosphere , can be seen in the lower panel .",
    "this is an example of the lowering of the typical ion state seen at the long wavelength end of the atlas .",

    "the electronic version of this paper contains a full set of three - panel spectral plots , covering our full spectral range , similar to figs.1 and 2 .",
    "the fits products available through mast are two - extension binary table files .",
    "each extension contains data for a _ fuse _ detector side as well as salient details about the observation ( only one extension is needed for the single _ copernicus _ atlas spectrum of @xmath0sco ) .",
    "the first fits extension contains _ fuse _",
    "side1 data as well as data for wavelengths above 1181 .",
    "the spectral data are arranged in three columns consisting of wavelengths , fluxes , and an integer flag with value 0 , 1 , or 2 .",
    "fluxes at wavelengths shorter than 1188   have a flag value 0 if they are formed mainly in an ism feature , , a value 1 if they are formed mainly in the photosphere , and a value 2 ( side 1 only ) if they are associated with a wavelength greater than 1188   and come from an observation of a star other than the star oberved for wavelengths below this limit .",
    "full coverage plots can be made either by ignoring the flags or coplotting each set of segments with with their separate flag codings .",
    "the wavelength and flux vectors are in native units ( wavelengths in ngstroms , fluxes in ergs s@xmath15@xmath25@xmath15 ) .",

    "we exhibit as figures 3 and 4 a montage of 8 of the 10 atlas spectra in the region of the ciii 1176   complex .",
    "this aggregate consists of a series of six primary ciii lines arising from levels at @xmath27 = 6.5ev .",
    "annotations of the ions responsible for primaries in _ most _ line groups are given for the three templates in fig.3 - at the top for b0 and at the bottom for b2 .",
    "these annotations are staggered even - odd vertically in the figure so as to make the identifications readable . in fig.4",
    "the line crowding is severe enough that we were obliged to display line identifications for b8 alone . in this case",
    "the two rows of annotations alternate at the top and bottom of the plot .",
    "these figures demonstrate that the ciii complex forms a useful diagnostic not only for early b types but for late b stars as well . however , we note that the precise positions of individual components become shifted by blends from nearby fe - group line blends .",
    "the 1176   region is an especially instructive example of the interplay of carbon and heavy element lines .",
    "at least a few lines in this wavelength region remain visible through all b types ( e.g. criii 1182 ) or at least at the early or late ends of the b domain ( e.g. , for b0-b8 : ni 1172 and 1177 ; for b5-b9 : civ 1169   and siiii 1182 ) . some of these indicators , such as a pair of weak ciii and civ lines , are visible to earlier types .",
    "in fact , from a few o star spectra examined outside our atlas sample , we discovered that various ciii lines in the wavelength interval shown in fig.3 can form a diagnostic for differentiating between late o spectral types and also between main sequence and giant stars ( see @xmath4[chem ] ) .",
    "the number of lines found in our spectral templates for b0 , b2 , and b8p is 2288 , 1612 , and 2469 , respectively . of these , 7.9% , s . ] , 2.1% , and 2.2% could not be identified from our line library .",
    "the percentages of lines that are overpredicted are 12.5% , 5.5% , and 5.6% , respectively .",
    "conversely , similar percentages , namely 13% , 7% , and 6% of our found features , have  uncertain \" ( low log@xmath19 ) criterion .",
    "we expect that the great majority of these are actually valid identifications and their log@xmath19s are too low .",
    "for example , random spot checks of the log@xmath19 s required to match the observed strengths with our spectral syntheses suggest that the log@xmath19 error distribution is likewise consistent with a broad gaussian with two approximately equal  weak \" and  strong \" tails .",
    "photospheric lines account for 93.7% , 87.0% , and 91.3% of the identifications in the respective templates .",
    "the few percent complement of these are due to ism features , which become increasing numerous with decreasing wavelengths .",
    "for example , shortward of 1148 , we identified a total of 200 h@xmath1 lines that are either dominant or secondary contributors to absorption features .",
    "of these only two identifications are clearly h@xmath1 primary lines in the @xmath0sco spectrum , a star located along the  scorpius ism tunnel . \"",
    "more typically , h@xmath1 lines comprise the overwhelming contribution of the ism component in our b2 and b8p template spectra and account for the lower two percentages ( 87.0% , 91.3% ) for these cases compared to the overall identification rates .    as to photospheric features",
    ", we made a total of 5800 photospheric atomic line identifications in the three template stars , of which 4216 are unique .",
    "we expect that synthetic photospheric and ism spectra could be computed solely from this list of unique lines .",
    "this also means that altogether our list includes 13.7% of our adopted line library tabulations over its range of 949 to 1225 .",
    "we believe this high rate ( particularly considering the inclusion of excited ions in our line list ) speaks to the general success of our identification efforts .",
    "we estimate that this percentage would be as high as 15 - 16% if we excluded wavelength regions blanketed by saturated resonance , hydrogen , or h@xmath1 ism lines .    from our line statistics we find a few trends with spectral type .",
    "the first of these is the a comparatively high rate of uncertain identifications and nonidentifications for b0 spectral features , suggesting an incompleteness in log@xmath19 s for transitions arising from thrice ionized fe - group elements .",
    "however , at least part of this is likely a residual of the problem that interfered with the identification efforts by re85 .",
    "many of re85 s still unconfirmed identifications may well prove to be correct at some future point when quantitative measurements of these lines are made .",
    "a second trend with spectral type is in the number of far - uv photospheric lines identifed across the range of b spectra .",
    "we found a local minimum at type @xmath28b2 in the number of detected lines .",
    "some 20 - 25% of the comparative dearth of identifications at type b2 arises from obscuration of photospheric lines by the larger wavelength regions dominated by strong ism h@xmath1 and photospheric resonance lines arising from ions like siiii .",
    "the rest of this dearth is a consequence of the ionizations changing from thrice and single ionization states to second ionizations as one moves toward b2 from b0 and b8 .",
    "thus , the addition of lines of twice - ionized states does not compensate for the loss of lines from the other two ion stages .",
    "an additional detail is that over 91% of the identified photospheric lines in the b2 spectrum are also visible ( as primary or secondary lines ) in either the b0 or b8 spectrum .",
    "conversely , some 67% and 53% of the lines in the b0 and b8 spectrum are _ not _ visible in the b8 and b0 spectrum , respectively .",
    "some 608 primary or secondary lines remain visible across the entire b main sequence domain .",
    "a third trend is that the percentage of isolated primary lines in resolution wavelength bin groups declines dramatically across the early b spectral range ( from 81% at b0 , 66% at b2 , to 59% at b8p ) and also with decreasing wavelength .",
    "some of these  isolated \" primary lines are barely resolved , and these can be utilized only in a sharp - lined spectrum .",
    "for this reason the list of least contaminated lines ( table4 ) runs to only 5% of the total line list .    the general expectation that the fe- group lines dominate the far - uv spectra of hot stars",
    "is borne out by our identifications .",
    "indeed iron itself dominates this population .",
    "numbers of iron lines identified in the associated ion stages are exhibited in table5 .",
    "lines of chromium , followed closely by manganese , are a distant second to the incidence of iron lines .",

    "overall , we found 6 excited lines from this ion in our photospheric syntheses ( including 3 resonance lines apparently not in dispute ) .",

    "s ii :  * several 3ev lines at 1095.0 , 1116.1 , 1124.4 , 1124.9 ( strong ) , and 1131.6   make their appearances at b1-b2 and strengthen with advancing type .",
    "the less excited lines at 1006.2 and 1045.7   increase more slowly , making them possible abundance indicators ( along with the just noted siii lines ) .",
    "* cl ii :  * the line at 1087.3 , arising from a level at 3.5ev , is the only clii feature available in the far - uv , but is blended with an feii and niii line at b2 .",
    "the far - uv cl lines are not suitable for constraining thermodynamic information about b - star atmospheres .",
    "abundances of chlorine from far - uv lines of clii or cliii may be estimated only with great care .",
    "* cr iii :  * the number density of cr@xmath30 peaks at about b2 , and the strengths of several available low - excitation lines increase noticeably .",
    "these lines include 967.5 , 1040.0 , 1041.3 , 1047.0 , 1055.8 , 1065.3 , 1073.7 , 1119.9 , 1132.7 , and 1146.3 .",
    "arising at 4 ev , the 1181.7 and 1187.5   lines slowly _ decrease _ , suggesting that they would make the best chromium abundance diagnostics .",
    "this is a fortunate circumstance , e.g. for the study of abundances in late - type chromium - rich b peculiar spectra , as these lines are just within the wavelength limits of both _",
    "iue _ and _ fuse _ high dispersion spectra .",
    "* cr ii :  * there are no reliable lines in the _ fuse _ regime for this ion that are visible across the entire b domain .",
    "the single 1219.5   line becomes visible at about o9.5 and becomes contaminated by blends beyond type b2 .",
    "* mn ii :  * just one semi - resolved line , 1161.2 , is visible for this ion . to the extent it can be resolved from nearby lines its strength increases slowly with type . therefore it can potentially serve as an abundance diagnostic , particularly in late b spectra where it is likely to be used to distinguish between normal b and mn - rich bp populations .",
    "* fe iv :  * a few lines with excitations of 19 - 20 ev are visible in the b0 to b2 range , and they decrease in strength with type : 1022.6 , 1047.2 , 1135.2 , 1156.2 , and 1157.4 .",
    "of these lines 1157   is among the most useful iron ionization diagnostics in early b spectra , first because of its nearly constant strength and second because of its proximity to the strengthening feiii 1157.5   line , which is a serviceable line for middle b spectra .    *",
    "fe iii :  * for the most part the numerous lines of feiii decrease in strength within the b range , e.g. 961.7 , 997.5 , 1005.1 , 1030.9 , 1045.9 , 1047.9 , 1057.5 , 1058.5 , 1076.5 , and 1117.3 .",
    "however , the features at 959.3 and 979.0   increase in strength slowly , attaining a maximum at b2 , and then decrease very slowly by 5 - 10% at b8 .",
    "contrasted with other feiii lines , these can be used for abundances .",
    "arising at 6.1 ev , the 1063.4   line increases in strength to b2 and remains roughly constant at later types .",
    "given this dependence , the line might be used as a secondary abundance indicator in late b stars .",
    "a few other lines exhibit more complicated dependences .",
    "for example 1164.7   ( 9.9 ev ) decreases in strength from b0 to b2 and disappears at later types .",
    "in addition to the feiv lines noted above , this line is a useful temperature diagnostic for the b0-b2 stars .",
    "because the 1221.0   line undergoes a maximum at b2 , it may serve as a secondary abundance indicator in this narrow domain and a secondary temperature indicator for early and late b spectra .",
    "* fe ii :  * all photospheric fe ii lines increase in strength through the b spectral domain ( but note the presence of ism lines of both feii and feiii in some b and o - type stars ( walborn et al .",
    "2002 ) . only isolated feii lines at 994.5 , 1075.6 , 1115.8 , 1150.6 , 1160.9 , and 1190.8   are visible for all b types .",
    "several are visible only near type b2 : 1091.5 , 1112.0 , 1116.9 , 1121.9 , 1124.1 , 1125.4 , and 1195.4 .    * co iv :  * seven high - excitation ( 16 - 17 ev ) lines are probably visible in late o stars and at type b0 , of which three are uncertain identifications .",
    "the likely identifications are at 1115.1 , 1116.0 , 1118.2 , and ( to type b1 ) 1188.0 .",
    "* co iii :  * lines at 1049.7 and 1116.8   arise from low ( 1.9 ev ) and high ( 9 ev ) excitation states , respectively .",
    "the contrast this pair of lines offers to one another suggests that they could be used to form a temperature diagnostic .",
    "both lines increase in strength with advancing type .",
    "* ni iii :  * because 973.7   increases strength through b2 to become blended at b5 , it does not offer a reliable ionization diagnostic .",
    "the 979.2   line shows only a slight increase in strength through the b types .",
    "this suggests it might be used as an abundance indicator in b stars .",
    "it can be added that a ptiii line at 1080.0   in the hd182308 spectrum ( b8vp ) is the only platinum line we have found .",
    "as this is the among the strongest unblended lines of this element in the far - uv spectrum of a b8-b9 star , it is not surprising to find it in a hg - mn b peculiar - type spectrum , it will certainly be present in others .    finally , the ari 1048.2   line is strongly contaminated by the ism in all or nearly all of the atlas spectra , including @xmath0sco . in general ,",
    "a number of atomic ism lines appear in all three spectra , including singly ionized atoms of c , n , o , and cl . in spectra later than b2 it is often difficult to assess the relative strengths of the photospheric and ism contributions , particularly since either contribution alone can saturate the core .",

    "<S> most of the spectra we assembled are from the archives of the _ fuse _ satellite , but for nine stars wavelength coverage above 1188   was taken from high - resolution _ iue _ or echelle _ hst / stis _ spectra . to represent the tenth star at type b0.2v we used the _ copernicus _ atlas of @xmath0sco . </S>",
    "<S> we made extensive line identifications in the region 949   to 1225   of all atomic features having published oscillator strengths at types b0 , b2 , and b8 . </S>",
    "<S> these are provided as a supplementary data product , - hence the term _ detailed _ atlas . </S>",
    "<S> our list of found features totals 2288 , 1612 , and 2469 lines , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we were able to identify 92% , 98% , and 98% of these features with known atomic transitions with varying degrees of certainty in these spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining lines do not have published oscillator strengths . </S>",
    "<S> photospheric lines account for 94% , 87% , and 91% , respectively , of all our identifications , with the remainder being due to interstellar ( usually molecular h@xmath1 ) lines . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the numbers of lines with respect to the distributions of various ions for these three most studied spectral subtypes . </S>",
    "<S> a table is also given of 167 least blended lines that can be used as possible diagnostics of physical conditions in b star atmospheres .    </S>",
