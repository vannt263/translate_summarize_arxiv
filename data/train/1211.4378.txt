    "a two - level atom ( tla ) that interacts with squeezed light fields ( or squeezed reservoirs ) may exhibit characteristic dynamics and fluorescence properties that depend on the strength and/or phase of the squeezing @xcite .",
    "for example , different decay rates for the two atomic - dipole quadratures @xcite and subnatural linewidth of resonance fluorescence peaks @xcite , were predicted .",
    "some of these features persist when the more realistic non - minimum - uncertainty state of thermal squeezed light is considered @xcite .",
    "recently it has also been shown that the error induced in coherent control of atoms by quantum fluctuations and light - atom entanglement may be either suppressed or enhanced when a squeezed light pulse is used for such control @xcite . however , a challenging limitation on the observability of most of these phenomena is the rather poor spatial overlap between the dipole radiation pattern of the atom and available paraxial sources of squeezed light .",
    "for this reason , atomic interaction with squeezed light in a cavity has been considered @xcite .",
    "a completely different approach towards observing such phenomena involves emulating the interaction of atoms with squeezed light , while the atom actually interacts with a reservoir in a thermal or vacuum state .",
    "this may be achieved by controlling accessible parameters of the atomic system without affecting the state of the inaccessible reservoir , thereby creating an effectively squeezed reservoir .",
    "for example , in @xcite two states of a laser - driven four - level - atom are shown to be coupled to an effectively squeezed reservoir whose properties are determined by the laser parameters .",
    "more proposals using multilevel atoms can be found in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that when a tla is driven by a strong classical field , while coupled to a thermal reservoir , it may be viewed as coupled to an effectively squeezed reservoir , as long as the rabi frequency of the driving field is not too small compared to the spectral width of the reservoir .    here",
    "we show that modulations of the level - spacing of a tla coupled to a thermal reservoir can lead to the same effect as its coupling to a squeezed reservoir .",
    "the key principle of our approach , that allows for effective squeezing , is the breakdown of the rotating - wave - approximation ( rwa ) of the field - atom interaction , resulting in an interaction similar to that obtained for a squeezed reservoir .",
    "the rwa implies neglecting the counter - rotating terms in the system - reservoir coupling that oscillate at least as fast as the level - spacing frequency , @xmath0 , and is valid for times much larger than @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "however , at shorter times , the counter - rotating terms are responsible for the appearance of terms characteristic of a squeezed reservoir in the master equation of the system , although it is coupled to a thermal , non - squeezed , reservoir , as was shown in @xcite for quantum brownian motion ( conversely , when adopting the rwa but considering the interaction with a squeezed field mode , the effect of squeezing is reminiscent of the existence of counter - rotating terms @xcite ) . the question is whether modulation of the level - spacing can help preserve the counter - rotating terms even at times much longer than @xmath1 and thus lead to coupling to an effectively squeezed reservoir .",
    "such modulations have been extensively studied for both short , non - markovian , time scales and long , markovian , ones , and shown to drastically modify atomic decay @xcite , decoherence @xcite and thermodynamics @xcite , through either zeno - like suppression of the coupling to the reservoir or anti - zeno - like enhancement .",
    "we find that when the level - spacing modulations of a tla that is coupled to a thermal reservoir , are sufficiently fast and strong to break the rwa , the practically achievable degree of squeezing does not exceed that of a `` classically squeezed state '' @xcite , namely , a state wherein the effective squeezing parameter of the reservoir , @xmath2 , and its effective mode occupation at @xmath0 , @xmath3 , satisfy @xmath4 .",
    "in such a state the quadrature noise of the reservoir can not be less than that of the vacuum @xcite . emulating quantum squeezing ,",
    "so that @xmath5 @xcite , is possible , in principle , by this method , but rather impractical using present - day technology . in order to preserve the counter - rotating terms at long times ,",
    "i.e. make them non - oscillatory in time , the required modulation strength and frequency is found to be of the order of @xmath0 , which makes this scheme suitable for the microwave regime rather than the optical one .",

    "for instance , when @xmath131 we obtain @xmath161 , @xmath162 , whereas for @xmath163 we get @xmath164 , @xmath165 , and the corresponding ratios for these @xmath166 cases are @xmath167 .      making use of eq .",

    "this spectrum is proportional to that of the fluorescent light emitted by the atom and it reveals both effects of the modulation .",
    "first of all , even if squeezing was absent and the spectrum would still be a lorentzian of width @xmath172 , the modulation changes it from the unmodulated thermal value , @xmath173 .",
    "perhaps the more interesting effect however , is that of squeezing @xcite , namely the spectrum is actually not a single lorentzian , rather it is a sum of two lorentzians with different widths @xmath158 and @xmath174 . as in the dipole dephasing case , the effect becomes more apparent as the two widths become more distinct . in fig .",
    "3 we present , for the case @xmath175 , the comparison of the fluorescence spectrum with and without modulation .",

    "the spectrum is comprised of the three well known lorentzian peaks centered at @xmath0 and @xmath179 @xcite , but here it is modified by squeezing .",
    "in fact , we obtain a phase - dependent phenomenon , namely the widths of the fluorescence peaks , @xmath180 and @xmath181 , change when the phase of the strong field is varied .",
    "the phase dependence is only due to squeezing and provides a very good evidence of the effective squeezing induced by the modulation . in fig .",
    "4 we plot the central peak of the spectrum , a lorentzian of width @xmath180 , for @xmath166 and different values of @xmath182 . taking the case @xmath131 for example , and beginning with @xmath183 , @xmath184 and the only effect of the modulation is the modification of the reservoir modes occupancy @xmath3 with respect to the thermal one @xmath143 .",
    "this results in a narrower peak , @xmath185 instead of @xmath186 without modulation .",
    "when @xmath182 is varied to @xmath187 , @xmath180 gets a positive contribution from the squeezing term @xmath188 and as a result the peak broadens to @xmath189 .",
    "the narrowest peak is obtained for @xmath190 for which @xmath191 .",
    "we need to find a dipole transition , whose resonant energy @xmath0 can be controlled such that the two levels are still well separated from others . moreover , in the sinusoidal modulation considered in sec .",
    "v , the amplitude and frequency must exceed @xmath0 .",
    "this leads us to consider two almost degenerate states whose energy splitting may be controlled by oscillating fields in the microwave regime . since the effects discussed here involve coupling to radiation , it is also preferable that the dipole moment of the transition be large , as for rydberg levels .",
    "let us now discuss the timescale of the above phenomena .",
    "both the dipole dynamics and the fluorescence spectral widths are appreciable for @xmath192 .",
    "the two rates @xmath193 become distinct when there is squeezing , and in the cases discussed here , are of the order of @xmath194 to @xmath195 , with @xmath196 , where @xmath197 is the photon - reservoir temperature in energy units , and @xmath195 is the corresponding width without modulation .",
    "hence , we wish to observe phenomena at times @xmath198 .    recalling the atomic damping in the cavity , @xmath109 from eq .",
    "( [ gta ] ) , we have @xmath199 , with @xmath200 . here",
    "@xmath9 is the dipole matrix element of the tla transition and @xmath201 is the cavity mode volume , taken here to be of the order of the transition wavelength cubed .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath202 where @xmath203 is the atomic transition spontaneous emission rate in free space .",
    "the above expression shows that the considered effects grow with the temperature divided by the cavity linewidth , so that high temperatures and narrow - linewidth cavities ( still in the bad - cavity limit ) are preferable .",
    "finally , let us recall the conditions of validity for some of the approximations taken in our analysis .",
    "the derivation of the reservoir spectrum in the bad - cavity limit requires @xmath204 and @xmath205 . the long - time limit in sec .",
    "iv b is valid for @xmath206 , i.e. in our case we demand @xmath207 .",
    "_ example : rydberg levels_. consider the circular rydberg level @xmath208 . by dipole selection rules",
    ", it can only decay to the lower circular level @xmath209 or to the almost degenerate level @xmath210 .",
    "we choose @xmath211 and @xmath212 as our excited and ground states , respectively , and by a static magnetic field can induce an energy ( frequency ) shift , of say , @xmath213ghz ( the @xmath214 transition frequency is @xmath215ghz ) .",
    "another magnetic field , this time rf , is used for the modulation .",
    "it oscillates at a frequency of @xmath216ghz and is strong enough to induce an energy shift of a few ghz .",
    "for example , a scheme for atom fluorescence may consist of first preparing the atom in state @xmath211 , then applying modulations and measuring the fluorescence spectrum . since the atom may also decay to the lower circular state @xmath217 , the spectrum may have an additional peak at @xmath218ghz , but the interesting peak for our purposes is the one at @xmath219ghz .",
    "to evaluate the typical timescale of such an experiment , we calculated the dipole matrix element of the above @xmath220 transition by assuming that for such high @xmath221 numbers the electronic wavefunctions are hydrogenic ( see appendix d ) .",
    "this is such , since in these large @xmath221 s the last electron is far from the rest of the atom and effectively `` sees '' a unit positive charge like the hydrogen nucleus .",
    "we obtained , e.g. for the @xmath222 component of the dipole , @xmath223 , where @xmath224 is the electron charge and @xmath225 the bohr radius .",
    "the spontaneous emission rate of the transition then becomes @xmath226hz , and by taking @xmath227hz , we obtain , at room temperature @xmath228k , @xmath229hz .",
    "this means that the experiment should last @xmath230ms to @xmath231ms .",
    "we also verified that the conditions of validity mentioned above are satisfied .",
    "the effect can be further enhanced by effectively increasing the reservoir temperature by shining on the atom hot thermal radiation , or the radiation from any other strong incoherent source , which is wideband around @xmath0 .",
    "this study used the apparent equivalence between counter - rotating terms in the reservoir - atom interaction and the relaxation of an atom coupled to a squeezed reservoir , to show how to engineer a thermal - reservoir so that it emulates a squeezed - reservoir . the key point that allows us to achieve this goal",
    "is the breaking of the rotating - wave approximation even at long times , by fast and strong system energy - modulation . to this end",
    ", we derived a general master equation , without invoking the markov and rotating - wave approximations , so as to render the effect of modulation in clear form .",
    "the master equation assumes a two - level system , yet , it is easily generalized to any system - reservoir interaction of the form @xmath232 , where @xmath233 is a system operator with matrix elements between different energy states of the system and @xmath22 is a reservoir operator with a continuous spectrum : e.g. , for a system of a harmonic oscillator with lowering operator @xmath234 , @xmath235 , and in the master equation @xmath236 are replaced by @xmath237 ( with a modification for the energy correction term @xmath238 ) .",
    "extension of the treatment to energy - level modulation in multilevel or multipartite systems described by large angular momenta @xcite is expected to yield qualitatively new features .    in order to illustrate our scheme for squeezed reservoir engineering , we considered the case of an atom inside a cavity , namely a lorentzian reservoir , in the markov regime , and applied sinusoidal modulations .",
    "we discussed possible measurable effects in atomic - dipole dephasing and fluorescence , along with experimental considerations and a possible realization of a system comprised of two atomic rydberg levels .",
    "we would like to thank ido almog and serge rosenblum for fruitful discussions .",
    "we acknowledge the support of dip , isf and the wolfgang pauli institute ( e.s . ) .",
    "ii , we found the resulting effective reservoir parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 for case _ c _ ,",
    "where modulations are considered and only the @xmath239 and @xmath240 terms exist . looking at their difference , @xmath241,\\ ] ] we can see that quantum squeezing , i.e. @xmath139 that satisfies @xmath242 , becomes largest for @xmath243 , i.e. for zero temperature , when the original reservoir has no thermal excitations .",
    "this is indeed what we observe for the lorentzian reservoir in sec .",
    "iv and the modulation from sec . v. taking @xmath244 , @xmath129 and modulation parameters @xmath132 and @xmath131 , nearly perfect quantum squeezing of @xmath245",
    "is achieved , with @xmath246 and @xmath247 .",
    "the problem remains to find a realization using present - day technology . as mentioned before , since fast and strong modulation is more suitable for microwave frequencies , and since here we saw that sufficiently low temperatures are needed for @xmath248 , it is natural to consider superconducting qubits in circuit qed cavities @xcite .",
    "then for @xmath249ghz and typical dipole matrix elements @xmath250 we find @xmath251khz .",
