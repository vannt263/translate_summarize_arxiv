    "this picture is consistent with radiative hydrodynamical simulations by @xcite and the very recent high - resolution global simulations by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the driving mechanism of angular momentum transfer of gas in circumplanetary disks is not yet well understood . for accretion disks in general ,",

    "we introduce a gas depletion factor and model the situation when a gas giant opens a gap , or gas in the protoplanetary disk is globally depleted . for the evaluation of mri activity , we use the elsasser number . the elsasser number is proportional to the ionization degree , which we calculate for several conditions using the method developed by @xcite . for ionization sources ,",
    "we take into account galactic cosmic rays , x - rays from the host star , and the decay of short - lived radionuclides . in section",

    "there are two criteria for the mri to be active @xcite .",
    "first , the ionization degree of the disk gas should be high enough to couple to the magnetic field .",
    "we use the elsasser number to investigate mri activity .",
    "the elsasser number is written as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the @xmath4 component of the alfvn velocity , @xmath5 is the magnetic diffusivity , and @xmath6 is the keplerian frequency . in order for the mri to operate , @xmath7 must be larger than unity @xcite . the region where @xmath8 is a dead zone .",
    "the magnetic diffusivity can be written as follows @xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 ( the ratio of the number densities of electrons and neutral gas molecules ) is the ionization degree .",

    ", we consider only ohmic dissipation and neglect the ambipolar and hall diffusivities that mostly work to stabilize the mri .",
    "if we know the strength of the magnetic field and the temperature of the gas , we only need the ionization degree to estimate @xmath7 ( note that ions and charged dust grains are much heavier than electrons and therefore their motion is negligible ) . in this work",
    ", we treat the magnetic field as a parameter and calculate the ionization degree of an isothermal disk .",
    "the ratio of gas pressure , @xmath12 , and the @xmath4 component of magnetic pressure , @xmath13 , represents the @xmath4 component of the plasma beta , which is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the net vertical magnetic field , @xmath16 is the @xmath4 component of alfvn velocity , @xmath17 is the sound speed , which is assumed constant , and @xmath18 is the gas density .",

    "we assume @xmath22 is constant and choose @xmath24 and @xmath25 , which are optimistic values for mri .",
    "the higher net field strength means that more magnetic flux threads the disk .",
    "second , the wavelength of the most unstable mode , @xmath26 , should be smaller than the scale height of the disk .",
    "this corresponds to the condition for a weak magnetic field : if the magnetic field is too strong , magnetic tension prevents disk gas from becoming turbulent .",
    "we refer to the region with @xmath27 as the magnetically dominated atmosphere where the mri is suppressed .",
    "thus , from equation ( [ 528 ] ) , the condition to be mri - active is written as @xmath28 or equivalently , @xmath29 when the mri is driven , magnetic fields are amplified by turbulence and the magnetically dominated atmosphere encroaches on the active region .",

    "( see equation ( 37 ) of * ? ? ?",
    "this implies that the real plasma beta at the border becomes @xmath31 .",

    "then , the mid - plane temperature can be written as @xmath172 where @xmath173 is the jupiter mass .",
    "when the mid - plane temperature exceeds about 1000k , gas in the disk will be sufficiently ionized to have the mri .",
    "the inner disk may be hot enough to have thermal ionization especially during the early phases of gas giant formation ; however , the outer disk seems to remain cool .",
    "more detailed calculations of the mid - plane temperature of circumplanetary disks have been done by @xcite .",
    "another possibly important mechanism for satellite formation is the capture of planetesimals when they cross circumplanetary disks @xcite ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for the gas - poor case ) .",
    "since our results suggest a large surface density , capture is expected to be effective .",
    "non - axisymmetry in the density structure caused by these proto - satellites may play a role in angular momentum transport and it may be interesting to analyze that effect .",
    "we estimated the size of regions that can sustain magnetic turbulence in circumplanetary disks .",
    "we calculated the ionization degree in disks accounting for galactic cosmic rays , x - rays from the host star of the surrounding protoplanetary disk , and the decay of short - lived radionuclides as ionization sources , and evaluated the mri activity .",
    "we adopted the @xmath75 model and solved the diffusion equation of a disk with infalling mass flux from a protoplanetary disk , obtained by @xcite . even by varying parameters such as gas infall rate , magnetic field , dust - to - gas mass ratio , and radius of dust grains over a wide range , it was difficult to find a sufficiently sized mri - active region that can sustain well - developed turbulence , a region where both the elsasser number is larger than unity and the magnetic pressure is sufficiently smaller than the gas pressure .",
    "we found that the surface density that can sustain well - developed mri turbulence is @xmath1740.001 - 0.01 g @xmath72 , even without dust grains , for a typical satellite - forming region .",
    "note that we have performed the calculations for a very optimistic set of assumptions for activation of the mri .",
    "if metals are frozen out onto dust grains or cosmic rays are shielded by stellar activities , situations become much severer to sustain mri .",
    "if there are mri - active regions , we can estimate the accretion stress with the empirical formula of @xcite .",
    "however , we find that the mri is unlikely to be well developed in circumplanetary disks with cosmic rays , x - rays , and radionuclides ; even if the mri can be initiated , the active turbulence can not be sustained .",
    "as long as the mri is the only mechanism of gas accretion in less massive disks , our results suggest that disk surface density increases until it becomes gravitationally unstable . if this is the case , the picture of satellite formation should be changed . in order to examine this suggestion",
    ", we have to investigate other possible mechanisms such as spiral density waves , baroclinic instability , or global magnetic braking .    in this paper",
    ", we have used the analysis of @xcite for the formation phases of circumplanetary disks .",
    "however , the long - term evolution of the gas infall rate from a protoplanetary disk to a circumplanetary disk is not yet well understood . to investigate this further ,",
    "it is necessary to know the evolution of protoplanetary disks , such as the gap opening timescale and its effect on density structure .",
    "we need to study how a change in the density of protoplanetary disks affects the infall rate onto circumplanetary disks .",
    "we thank sanemichi z. takahashi and hiroshi kobayashi for fruitful discussions .",
