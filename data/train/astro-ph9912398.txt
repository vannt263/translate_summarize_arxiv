    "for some time now the existence of a warp in our galaxy has been well known .",
    "first seen in neutral hydrogen emission , it s presence in several other components have since been reported , i.e. iras point sources ( @xcite ) , co gas ( @xcite ) , and dust ( @xcite ) .",
    "studies of the galactic warp have been mostly limited to it s spatial structure ( see binney 1992 for review ) because the kinematic signature of a warp primarily manifests itself in the component tangential to the line - of - sight ( los ) of an observer near the galactic plane , the component that can not be directly measured by radio observations . for stars , on the other hand ,",
    "this component is in principle accessible via proper motions , but in practice this approach has been limited by the small magnitude of the expected systematic motion ( @xmath12 @xmath2 ) , which is smaller than the zonal systematic errors in traditional catalogues .",
    "the advent of astrometry from space , inaugurated with the hipparcos satellite , signals a new era in the study of galactic kinematics ; the high precision ( @xmath3 ) and accuracy ( @xmath4 ) of the proper motions combined with and inertial frame means that it is now possible to detect the kinematic signature expected from a galactic warp .",
    "once the spatial structure of the warp is determined , its kinematic signature will yield direct information on the precession rate of the warp .",
    "earlier we reported results from a subsample of the hipparcos catalogue ( @xcite ) . in that study",
    "we looked exclusively at distant ob stars toward the anticenter ( between 70 and 290 degrees in galactic longitude ) , expecting such stars to trace the motions of the gaseous component from which they were recently born .",
    "unexpectedly it was found that their kinematics did not follow the predicted signature of a long - lived warp , either precessing or not .",
    "this led to the conclusion that either there are additional systematic vertical motions in the galaxy s gaseous component , or that the warp is not a long - lived structure .",
    "in this contribution we use a larger sample of ob stars from the hipparcos catalogue to reinvestigate their systematic vertical motions . as before , our interpretation of the data is based upon a comparison between the observed kinematics of the selected sample of ob stars , and the `` observe '' kinematics of a sample created using a synthetic catalogue generator .",
    "the synthetic catalogues are generated based on an assumed statistical model of the ( warped ) stellar distribution , kinematics and observational errors . by making the identical selections and cuts on the simulated catalogues",
    "as are made on the actual data , any biases present or introduced in the sample of ob stars due to errors or selection criterion are likewise reproduced in the synthetic samples as well . in this way",
    "the modeled kinematics are translated into observed quantities which can be directly compared with those of the selected sample of stars .",
    "in essence , rather than attempting to remove or correct biases in the observed sample , we introduce the same biases into the model in order to determine what is actually detectable .    in the following section the new sample of ob stars",
    "is described , while in sect .",
    "3 the model for the errors used for the synthetic catalogues is presented .",
    "4 details an improved estimate of the distances and in sect .",
    "5 , using a simple model for the galactic warp , we find spatial parameters consistent the distribution of the hipparcos ob stars . in sect . 6 we discuss the estimation of the systematic vertical motions , derive the kinematic signature resulting from a long - lived precessing warp , and compare the observed and expected kinematic signatures .",
    "7 describes the bias introduced in the estimation of the vertical motions by errors in the distance and how these , in conjunction with a smaller amplitude and precession , can produce smaller systematic motions than otherwise expected .",
    "we present our conclusions in sect .",
    "the sample of ob stars used here to study the galactic warp is taken from the 10544 ob stars in the hipparcos catalogue ; after excluding 3 stars whose spectral typing is no more specific than `` o '' or `` b '' , we find 4538 stars with a parallax @xmath5 .",
    "stars with measured parallaxes @xmath6 are retained , as their exclusion would unfavorably bias the sample with respect to distance .",
    "in the tycho catalogue there are 857 stars brighter than @xmath7 magnitude 7.5 which do not appear in the hipparcos catalogue , which has a total of 24384 stars brighter than this magnitude .",
    "this suggests that the hipparcos catalogue is approximately 97 percent complete to this magnitude limit . from our sample alone ,",
    "based on the distribution of apparent magnitudes brighter than magnitude 7 , we estimate that the subsample of 3840 ob stars with @xmath8 is 98 percent complete ( @xcite ) . of these brighter stars ,",

    "4 we will improve upon these distance estimates , but nevertheless complete spectral classification is needed to calculate a photometric parallax . for the 7279 ob stars with complete spectral classification supplied by hipparcos ,",
    "the absolute magnitudes and colors from schmidt - kaler ( 1982 ) are used to calculate the photometric parallax . for 141 stars without luminosity classification h@xmath9 linewidths",
    "were used to determine luminosity class .",
    "the 3121 remaining stars without luminosity classification have photometric distances derived from their reddening and estimated absorptions .",

    ", the sample of all ob stars brighter than 7.5 will be considered in the following section .",
    "these are 3840 in number , with 789 not having an initial luminosity classification ( nonlc stars ) . as we expect that our estimation of the luminosity classes for these stars will be more susceptible to error than those with full spectral classification",
    ", it is important to be aware of biases in their distribution . indeed , because of the use of the michigan spectral survey in the southern sky ( @xcite and references therein ) , 745 of the bright nonlc stars ( 94 % ) are in the north ( @xmath10 deg ) .",
    "this zonal bias results in a photometric error that is systematically larger in the northern part of the sky than the south , as the following section describes .",
    "= 6.0 cm    = 7.0 cm    to account for the higher photometric error introduced by the nonlc stars , it is necessary to describe their distribution not only on the sky , but also with respect to other relevant variables .",

    "[ nolclego ] the relative fraction of nonlc stars with respect to apparent magnitude for b9 , b8 , b5 and b3 spectral types .",
    "the fact that the nonlc stars are primarily restricted to these types , and not hardly seen in types b7 , b6 , and b4 , indicates that the nonlc stars are in general typed at a lower resolution than those stars with luminosity class . for stars of spectral types earlier than b2 the relative fraction of nonlc stars does not vary strongly with apparent magnitude .    while in sect .",
    "4 only a magnitude cut is applied , in sects . 5 and 6 two additional cuts are employed ; stars with a parallax of @xmath11 and a vertical velocity greater than 50 @xmath12 are removed . the parallax cut is imposed to avoid being biased by local structure , such as gould s belt , which dominates the distribution of nearby ob stars .",
    "the velocity cut is astrophysically motivated by the presence of runaway stars , which through close encounters have reached escape velocities , and thus do not possess kinematics principally determined by the galactic potential .",
    "the typical threshold detection value for the relative space velocity of runaway stars varies from 40 to 65 @xmath12 ( blaauw  1993 ,  torra  et  al .",
    "1997 ) , thus our value of 50 @xmath12 applied to one component is conservative , especially as it is approximately seven times greater than the velocity dispersion of this population .",
    "the velocity cut is applied to galactocentric radial bins , excluding those stars which deviate from each bin s median velocity by more than @xmath13 , reducing the sample of bright , distant ob stars to 895 in number ( less 34 ) , 142 of which are nonlc stars .",
    "meanwhile 255 are cut from all the stars with @xmath14 , leaving 4283 stars , 1291 of which are nonlc stars .",
    "the calculation of the individual and mean vertical velocity is discussed in sect .",
    "in order to interpret the observed kinematics of ob stars from the hipparcos catalogue , a program was developed to generate synthetic catalogues based on a statistical model of the spatial and velocity distributions of the ob stars ( drimmel  et  al .",
    "1997 , 1999 ) .",
    "the model distribution is non - axisymmetric , being described by spiral arm segments , most important of which is the local orion arm , which has a pitch angle of 8 degrees and a spur projecting toward the outer perseus spiral arm .",
    "the synthetic catalogue generator produces catalogues with distributions in galactic longitude and latitude ( @xmath15 ) , apparent magnitude , and proper motion , which closely resemble those of the distant ( @xmath5 ) ob stars in the hipparcos catalogue ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the synthetic catalogue generator uses a galactic dust distribution model based on the 240@xmath16 cobe data ( drimmel & spergel , in preparation ) to calculate absorbtions .",
    "this model is a refined version of the earlier work of spergel  et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) , adding nonaxisymmetric structure to the dust distribution model , the most important of which is dust associated with the local orion arm . the added structure in the dust distribution results in additional reddening in the directions tangent to the local arm , thus improving the modeled longitude distributions ( see drimmel  et  al .",
    "1999 as compared to drimmel  et  al .",
    "this same model is used to estimate reddenings and absorptions to the nonlc stars .",
    "observational errors are modeled for generating observed quantities .",
    "the simulated catalogues in smart  et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) used parallax errors , @xmath17 , equal to 1mas , and proper motion errors , @xmath18 , were described by simple functions of galactic latitude , as seen in the hipparcos catalogue ( @xcite ) .",
    "these errors are actually better described as varying with ecliptic latitude and apparent magnitude .",
    "we have thus improved our model for @xmath17 and @xmath18 by interpolating from tables 3.2.4 - 6 given in the first volume of the hipparcos catalogue ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have also added a 0.01 magnitude error to the apparent magnitudes . for our purposes here the hipparcos errors in position ( @xmath15 ) are negligible .",
    "however , the improvement of the model of photometric distance error makes the greatest difference in the simulated observable kinematics of the synthetic catalogues .",
    "previously our error model involved adding a relative gaussian error of 25 percent of the distance .",
    "however , if the errors are normally distributed in absolute magnitude , it is the errors in the distance modulus that are normally distributed .",
    "we now model the error in photometric distance by assuming a normal distribution of errors in the absolute magnitude .",
    "this error is not only the result of the intrinsic scatter of absolute magnitudes , termed `` cosmic error '' , but also due to errors introduced by uncertainties in the determination of the absorption , intrinsic scatter in the colors , and misclassification errors .",
    "not all these errors are guaranteed to be gaussian .",
    "the photometric error of our observed sample of stars is evaluated using the photometric parallax @xmath19 verses trigonometric parallax @xmath20 distribution for the sample of 3840 ob stars brighter than 7.5 .",
    "[ pipi_all ] shows the @xmath19@xmath20 distributions for the north and the south .",

    "[ pipi_nord ] shows the @xmath19@xmath20 diagrams for the north decomposed into the stars with and without luminosity class .",
    "it can be seen that the northern stars which possess full initial classification ( fig .",
    "5 left ) have approximately the same scatter as the southern stars ( fig .",
    "4 right ) , and we will assume the same error model can be used for both .",
    "one difference between the northern and southern stars with full initial classification is a systematic bias of @xmath19 in the south for stars with @xmath20 centered at 7.5mas .",
    "this bias is due to the presence of stars in the direction of @xmath21 ophiuchus whose absorptions are systematically overestimated .    assuming that the observational errors in the hipparcos trigonometric parallax are well described , we can estimate the photometric error using the synthetic catalogue generator , comparing observed and generated @xmath19@xmath20 distributions .",
    "for the northern stars with luminosity classification an error model which approximately reproduces the observed distribution of trigonometric and photometric parallaxes is @xmath22 where the apparent magnitude term can be interpreted as being the result of a higher occurrence of classification error at fainter magnitudes , and the absolute magnitude term can be interpreted as an increasing cosmic error and/or uncertainty for the more luminous stars . to characterize the distribution a robust linear fit is made to the observed @xmath19@xmath20 distribution in the north ( fig .",
    "[ pipi_nord ] ) , giving a slope of 0.77 and a mean absolute deviation in @xmath20 of 1.28 , after 17 stars are excluded whose absolute deviations in @xmath20 are greater than 6 mean absolute deviations ( presumably misclassified stars ) .",

    "= 7.0 cm    however , before applying such errors the distribution of nonlc stars must be modeled .",

    ". this may indeed be the case as radio data yield a warp amplitude between .3 and .4kpc at a galactic radius of 10kpc ( @xcite ) , while our warp parameters produce an amplitude of .8kpc . in fig .",
    "[ h_allonone24s1 ] the signature expected from our standard warp ( @xmath139 ) is shown together with the signature of a warp with half amplitude ( @xmath140 ) .",
    "lastly , the warp may be precessing in the direction of galactic rotation . fig .",
    "[ h_allonone24s1 ] shows the expected signal of a warp of half amplitude precessing at @xmath141 .",
    "while these three effects , taken together , have significantly reduced the expected velocity signature , we still have not recovered the negative velocities seen in our hipparcos sample .",
    "could higher precession rates , or higher errors in the photometric distances produce the velocity signature that we detect ?",
    "the fourth model in fig .",
    "[ h_allonone24s1 ] shows the effect of a precession rate of @xmath142 on a warp of half amplitude with elevated photometric error ( @xmath143 ) . in this extreme case",
    "negative vertical motions are finally achieved .",
    "we have confirmed with a larger and more complete sample of distant ob stars that the observed kinematics and structure perpendicular to the galactic plane are together inconsistent with the hypothesis of a long - lived non - precessing warp .",
    "however , with a revised model for the errors , negative systematic velocities can be produced , but only with excessively large precession rates , a smaller warp and large photometric errors . a precession rate even as high as @xmath144 is questionable on physical grounds , for it would require that the warp was precessing faster than galactic rotation at a galactocentric radius of only 11kpc !    could the photometric error parameter even be as high as one magnitude ?",
    "the @xmath19@xmath20 distribution of models generated with such errors ( see fig . [ sigm_1 ] ) , compared to the observed @xmath19@xmath20 distribution ( fig .",
    "[ pipi_nord ] ) would suggest not .",
    "if we do not accept such large photometric errors and precession rates we are left with the same conclusions that we arrived at in our previous work ; either the galactic warp is not long - lived , or there are other systematic motions present in the galactic disk .",
    "galactic companions could be responsible for a short - lived warp , or at least modify the velocities , but the regularity of the galactic warp out to at least 16kpc from the galactic center makes this seem unlikely .",
    "nevertheless , numerical simulations will have to be carried out to explore this possibility .",
    "alternatively , the presence of other systematic vertical oscillations in the galactic disk could mask the kinematic signature of the warp , but should also be evidenced by accompanying deviations from the galactic plane .",
    "the warp amplitudes as inferred from the ob stars found here ( .4 to .8kpc at @xmath145 ) are larger than those found in the hii gas ( .3 to .4kpc at @xmath145 , @xcite ) and the dust ( .3 kpc at @xmath145 , @xcite ) , and may suggest the presence of such structures .",
    "in addition dehnen ( 1998 ) also finds that the kinematics of nearby stars are not consistent with a galactic warp that begins within the solar circle and could thus produce a local tilt in the stellar distribution .",
    "indeed , the observed slopes and anomalous kinematic signature may not be due to a warp at all , but to some other as yet unidentified phenomenon .",
    "the possibility of other systematic motions being present in the disk complicates any evaluation of the kinematics of the galactic warp .",
    "until a deeper and more accurate astrometric survey is completed the possibility of other kinematic effects can not be excluded nor , if present , be disentangled from the expected kinematic signature of the warp in the stellar distribution .",
    "such a survey will eventually be given by a future astrometric mission like gaia , which will also , via parallaxes , largely dispense with the bias introduced by the photometric distance errors .",
