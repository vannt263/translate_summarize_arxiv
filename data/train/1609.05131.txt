    "each kidney has an outer layer , called the _",
    "cortex _ , and an inner layer , known as the _ medulla _ @xcite .",
    "much of the space in these regions is filled by the functional units of the kidney , which are termed _",
    "depending on the organism , each kidney contains thousands to millions of nephrons .",
    "nephrons are responsible for the production of urine .",
    "kidneys contain two types of nephrons , cortical ( short ) and juxtamedullary ( long ) nephrons , each of which is surrounded by a net of capillaries .",
    "cortical nephrons remain almost entirely in the cortex , while juxtamedullary nephrons extent deep into the medulla .",
    "each nephron consists of a _ glomerulus _ and a _",
    "renal tubule_. further , each renal tubule consists of various permeable or impermeable segments @xcite .",
    "additionally , each nephron has access to a collecting duct for removal of the produced urine .",
    "kidneys are connected with the rest of the body by two blood vessels , the renal artery , which carries blood into the kidney , and the renal vein , which carries blood out of the kidney to recirculate the body .",
    "in addition , urine is excreted from the body through the ureter .",
    "blood coming from the renal artery is delivered to the afferent arterioles .",
    "a steady flow of blood coming from the afferent arteriole of a nephron is filtered in the glomerulus and flows into the renal tubule .",
    "the blood flow is maintained constant in each glomerulus by the constriction or relaxation of its afferent arteriole @xcite .",
    "nearly all of the fluid that passes through the renal tubules is reabsorbed and only a minor fraction results in urine .",
    "fluid is reabsorbed from the renal tubules in two stages : first by the renal interstitium and then by the surrounding capillaries .",
    "the processes underlying reabsorption are driven by the pressures in the interstitial spaces @xcite .",
    "although the pressures in the renal interstitium are important determinants of kidney function , there is a lack of investigations that look at the factors affecting them . here",
    "we develop a computational model of the rat kidney , for which several experimental data exist , and use it to study the relationship between arterial blood pressure and interstitial fluid pressure .",
    "in addition , we study how tissue flexibility affects this relationship and how the model predictions are affected by the uncertainty of key model parameters .",

    "the compartments fall in three categories : ( i ) _ regions _ that model the cortical and medullary interstitial spaces , ( ii ) _ pipes _ that model the blood vessels and renal tubules , and ( iii ) _ spheres _ that model the glomeruli .",
    "a schematic diagram depicting the arrangement of the compartments ( 135 ) is shown on figure  [ nephronmodel ] and a summary is given in table  [ tb:1 ] . to facilitate the description of the model equations below",

    "for example , the model accounts for differences in the location within the cortex or medulla , in the pre- and post - glomerular vascular supply , dimensions , reabsorptive capacity , etc .",

    "exceptions to this are the arcuate arteries and veins ( compartments 4 and 19 , respectively ) , which anatomically are located between the cortex and the medulla @xcite , so we compute @xmath36 for these compartments by the average of @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the volumes of the compartments , besides the regions and the afferent arterioles ( compartments 1 , 2 and 6 , 12 ) , depend _ passively _ on the pressure difference that is developed across their walls : @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 are constants .",
    "in particular , @xmath38 denotes a reference volume , and @xmath39 denotes the pressure difference across the walls of the compartment when @xmath41 equals @xmath38 .",
    "the parameters @xmath40 are a measure of the distensibility of the compartments .",
    "a large @xmath40 value indicates a compartment that is very distensible , while a low value @xmath40 indicates a more rigid compartment . in the model",
    ", we use @xmath42 such that an increase in @xmath35 or a decrease in @xmath36 leads to an expansion of the volume @xmath41 , and _",
    "vise versa_.    for a model pipe , let @xmath43 and @xmath44 denote the pressures at its inflow and outflow nodes , respectively .",
    "these pressures are related by a modified form of the poiseuille law : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the viscosity of the flowing fluid , @xmath47 is the length of the pipe , and @xmath48 is its radius . in the model , we assume @xmath46 and @xmath47 to be constants , while we compute @xmath48 based on the compartment s volume ( i.e. @xmath49 ) .",
    "equation   reduces to the common poiseuille equation for the impermeable pipes @xcite , while for the permeable pipes , it is assumed that @xmath2 is linearly distributed along the length of the pipe with a value of 0 at the end of the pipe .",
    "pressure at node c1 equals the arterial blood pressure @xmath50 , which in our model is a free variable .",
    "pressures at nodes c18 and c32 are kept constant at 4  mmhg and 2  mmhg , respectively , in agreement with the values of venous and ureter pressures used in previous modeling studies @xcite .",
    "the afferent arterioles are unique vessels in the sense that they _",
    "actively _ adjust radii such that blood flows through them at a fixed rate @xcite .",
    "in the model , we assume that blood flow in the afferent arterioles that feed the short and long nephrons ( i.e. @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively ) are kept fixed at 280  nl / min and 336  nl / min , respectively , as in previous modeling studies of renal hemodynamics , for example @xcite .    we compute the radii of the afferent arterioles by the poiseuille equation @xcite , which yields @xmath53 note that equations   and imply that whenever the pressure difference along the afferent arterioles @xmath54 and @xmath55 increases , the radii @xmath56 and @xmath57 decrease .",

    "the cortical and medullary interstitial spaces , i.e.  compartments 1 and 2 , lie outside of the compartments 335 and therefore must be calculated separately using a different set of equations .",
    "we obtain the first of such relationships by assuming that the net accumulation of interstitial fluid within the cortex and medulla is zero . that is @xmath60 where the flows @xmath2 are weighted based on the total number of the compartments contained in the full model ( table  [ tb:1 ] ) .",
    "equations   and require the oncotic pressures @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which in turn require the cortical and medullary protein concentrations @xmath61 and @xmath62 for equation  .",
    "protein concentrations in the cortical and medullary regions are computed assuming that the total mass of protein contained in each region , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively , remains constant .",
    "thus , @xmath65 we use the values @xmath66  mgr and @xmath67  mgr , which are computed such that the resulting model predicts reference pressures in the renal cortex and medulla of @xmath686  mmhg , similar to those estimated experimentally @xcite .",
    "cortical and medullary interstitial volumes @xmath69 and @xmath70 are assumed to change proportionally ; thus , @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the proportionality constant .",
    "the combined volume of the interstitial regions @xmath73 is calculated based on the total volume of the kidney @xmath74 according to @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are found by summing the total volumes of the pipe and glomerulus compartments contained within each region .",
    "finally , the total volume of the kidney @xmath74 is calculated by @xmath78 where in this case @xmath79 refers to the pressure external to the kidney , which is set to 0  mmhg .",
    "equation   assumes that the total volume of the kidney is determined by the distensibility of the renal capsule @xmath80 , which is stretched by the difference of the pressures developed across it , i.e. @xmath81 .      values for the model parameters are given in table  [ tb:3 ] .",
    "these values are chosen such that at a reference arterial blood pressure @xmath82 = 100  mmhg the model predicts pressures and volumes that are in good agreement with either direct experimental measurements @xcite or previous modeling studies @xcite .",
    "the pressure - volume relationships used in the model , equations   and , require values for the parameters @xmath40 .",
    "we assume that ( i ) @xmath40 scale proportionally to the reference volumes @xmath83 and ( ii ) the coefficients @xmath84 depend only on the histology of the associated compartment .",
    "that is , we group the compartments as follows :    * group g1 : renal capsule ( @xmath80 ) and papillary collecting duct ( @xmath85 ) * group g2 : glomeruli ( @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) * group g3 : renal tubules ( @xmath88@xmath89 ) and proximal collecting ducts ( @xmath90@xmath91 ) * group g4 : pre - afferent arteriole blood vessels ( @xmath92@xmath93 ) * group g5 : post - afferent arteriole blood vessels ( @xmath94@xmath95 and @xmath96@xmath97 )    then we assign the same flexibility value @xmath84 to all members of each group ( table  [ tb:3 ] ) . with this formulation , the model compartments in each histological group experience the same fractional change in volume whenever they are challenged by the same pressure gradient @xmath98 .    the available experimental data do not permit an accurate estimate of the values of the flexibility parameters .",
    "for this reason , we treat the flexibilities of the five groups @xmath99 as _ independent random variables_. to facilitate the comparison among the different groups , we set @xmath100 where @xmath101 are constants , and @xmath102 are random variables configured to have mode 1 .",
    "we estimate the values of @xmath101 empirically based on _ ex vivo _ measurements reported in  @xcite ( table  [ tb:3 ] ) .     of the histological groups g1g5 used in this study . ]    for each simulation , @xmath102 are drawn from the log - normal distribution ( figure  [ fig : lambda_pdfs ] ) , which is chosen such that ( i ) @xmath103 attain non - negative values , ( ii ) arbitrarily large values of @xmath103 are allowed , and ( iii ) low @xmath103 values are more frequent than large ones .",
    "we choose the latter condition assuming that the experimental procedures ( anesthesia , renal decapsulation , tissue isolation , etc . )",
    "utilized in @xcite likely increase rather than decrease tissue flexibility , thus our computed @xmath101 likely overestimate rather than underestimate @xmath99 .",
    "finally , we configure the log - normal distributions such that @xmath104 and @xmath105 have log - standard deviation of 1.1 , and @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 have log - standard deviation of 1.25 ( figure  [ fig : lambda_pdfs ] ) . according to our experience , such configuration reflects the degree of the uncertainty in our estimated values of @xmath101 , for which we consider @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 less accurately estimated than @xmath112 and @xmath113 .        for the sensitivity analysis of the model described in the previous sections ,",
    "we adopt a _ variance - based method _ which is best suited for non - linear models @xcite .",
    "let @xmath114 denote a generic model , where @xmath115 is an output value and @xmath116 are some random inputs ( in our case those represent the uncertain parameters ) .",

    "the first - order index @xmath123 indicates the fraction by which the variance of @xmath115 will be reduced if only the value of the factor @xmath117 is certainly specified @xcite .",
    "similar , the total - order index @xmath124 indicates the fraction of the variance of @xmath115 that will be left if all factors besides @xmath117 are certainly specified @xcite .",
    "we compute both indices , because generally for a non - linear model the factors are expected to interact in a non - additive way , and therefore @xmath124 is expected to be larger than @xmath123 .",
    "the difference @xmath125 characterizes the extent of the interactions with the other factors that @xmath117 is involved with .      to better characterize the contribution of the individual factors @xmath102 of equation  , in the variance of @xmath19 and @xmath20",
    ", we calculate their first- and total - order sensitivity indices given in   and .",
    "we compute the indices according to the method proposed by saltelli @xcite , which is computationally less demanding than a straightforward application of the formulas in and .    briefly , according to the saltelli method we form two input matrices : @xmath126 by generating monte carlo samples @xmath127 and @xmath128 for the factors @xmath102 .",

    "see @xcite .      for the numerical solution",
    ", we combine the model equations  into a system of 69 coupled non - linear equations . given a value for the arterial blood pressure @xmath50 and a choice for the flexibility parameters @xmath102 , the resulting system is solved to yield the values for the pressures at the interstitial regions @xmath19 and @xmath20 , the pressures at the model nodes @xmath140@xmath141 , and the volumes of the compartments @xmath69@xmath142 .    to obtain solutions , we implement the system in `",
    "matlab ` and use the standard root - finding function ( ` fsolve ` ) .",
    "this function computes solutions to the model equations iteratively by starting from a given initial approximation .",
    "for the initial approximation we use the reference values from literature ( table  [ tb:3 ] ) .",
    "note that by the construction of the model , the solution at reference can be obtained trivially , and thus no root - finding is necessary for this step .",
    "in the first set of simulations , we investigate how the pressures in the interstitial regions @xmath19 and @xmath20 are affected by the arterial blood pressure @xmath50 for selected choices of the flexibility parameters when @xmath50 varies in the range 80180  mmhg .",
    "in particular , we make the following choices for the flexibility parameters :    * case 1 : @xmath143 * case 2 : @xmath144 * case 3 : @xmath145 * case 4 : @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath150    figure  [ fig : selected ] shows key solution values .",
    "case 1 corresponds to a kidney with rigid compartments . in this case",
    ", pressure does not affect the volume of the compartments except of the two afferent arterioles @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "for example , at elevated @xmath50 , the pressure differences along the afferent arterioles @xmath54 and @xmath55 increase . as a result ,",
    "the arterioles constrict in order to maintain constant blood flow ( equations   and ) . given that total kidney volume @xmath74",
    "does not change as given by equation  , the reduction in afferent arteriole volume increases the volume of the interstitial regions @xmath69 and @xmath70 given by equation  . in turn ,",
    "increases in interstitial volumes reduce the protein concentrations @xmath61 and @xmath62 by equations   and the oncotic pressures @xmath15 and @xmath16 that promote uptake @xmath153 and @xmath154 of interstitial fluid by equations  . however , due to tubular reabsorption @xmath155@xmath156 , the flow of fluid into the interstitial spaces is kept constant ( equations   and ) .",
    "thus , in order to maintain a constant uptake and avoid accumulation of interstitial fluid , @xmath19 and @xmath20 increase . _ vise versa _ , a decrease in @xmath50 has the opposite effects and results in a decrease of @xmath19 and @xmath20 . because the total volume of the afferent arterioles is only a minor fraction of the volume of the interstitial regions ( @xmath682% , see table  [ tb:3 ] ) , even large changes of @xmath56 and @xmath57 induce small changes of @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , the total change in @xmath19 and @xmath20 , across the full range of @xmath50 variation , is in the order of 0.1  mmhg ( see blue curves in figure  [ fig : selected ] ) .",
    "case 2 corresponds to a kidney with distensible compartments .",
    "this case is similar to case 1 ; however , the changes of @xmath19 induced by the constriction of the afferent arterioles is followed by an expansion of the renal capsule ( equation  ) , which increases whole kidney volume @xmath74 .",
    "so , in this case , the cortical and medullary interstitial volumes @xmath69 and @xmath70 increase to a larger extent compared with case 1 in order to accommodate the expansion of @xmath74 . as a result , interstitial protein concentrations @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and oncotic pressures @xmath15 , and @xmath16 drop by larger amounts than in case 1 . consequently , significant drops in @xmath19 and @xmath20 follow ( see orange curves in figure  [ fig : selected ] ) .",
    "case 3 corresponds to a kidney with very flexible compartments and renal capsule . through the same effects as in cases 1 and 2 , changes in arterial pressure",
    "@xmath50 lead to similar changes in @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "because in this case the expansion of whole kidney volume @xmath74 is greater than in case 2 , due to the increased flexibility of the renal capsule @xmath80 , the interstitial pressures are affected to a greater extent too ( see yellow curves in figure  [ fig : selected ] ) .",

    ", @xmath50 affects severely the pressures in the pre - afferent arteriole vascular compartments @xmath157 , @xmath158 , and @xmath159 ( equation ) , which are not regulated by the active constriction / dilation of the afferent arterioles . as a result , whenever @xmath50 increases , @xmath157 , @xmath158 , and @xmath159 also increase , leading to an increase of the associated pre - afferent arteriole vascular volumes @xmath160 , @xmath161 , and @xmath162 .",
    "note that the increase of @xmath160 , @xmath161 , and @xmath162 opposes the reduction of @xmath151 and @xmath152 caused by constriction of the afferent arterioles . in this particular case ,",
    "opposite to what happens in cases 1 - 3 , the increase of the total volume of the pre - afferent arteriole compartments @xmath160 , @xmath161 , and @xmath162 exceeds the reduction of the total volume of the afferent arterioles @xmath151 and @xmath152 . as a result ,",
    "the interstitial regions are compressed , which in turn leads to increases of the protein concentrations @xmath61 and @xmath62 and oncotic pressures @xmath15 and @xmath16 . because the uptake of interstitial fluid is maintained constant ,",
    "this leads to reductions of @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "finally , the reductions of @xmath19 and @xmath20 are further amplified by constriction of the renal capsule that follows the reduction of @xmath19 .      from the previous section ,",

    "in contrast to the apparent lack of any trend between the computed pressures @xmath19 and @xmath20 and the input factors @xmath107 , the model predicts a high degree of correlation between @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the associated correlation coefficient reaches as high as 0.95 ( figure  [ fig : corr_7_factors ] right panel ) , which indicates that @xmath19 and @xmath20 are predicted to change _ in tandem _ in a seemingly linear way .      to better characterize the contribution of the individual factors @xmath102 in the variance of @xmath19 and @xmath20",

    "it is observed @xmath167 and @xmath168 , which indicate that the medullary pressure @xmath20 is more susceptible to interactions than cortical pressure @xmath19 .",
    "this behavior is expected , given that the afferent arterioles ( compartments 6 and 12 ) , which initiate the changes in @xmath19 and @xmath20 , are located exclusively in the cortex , while the medulla is susceptible mostly to secondary interactions initiated by the expansion / constriction of the renal capsule .     and @xmath20 at elevated arterial blood pressure ( @xmath134  mmhg ) .",

    "we develop a multi - compartmental computational model of the rat kidney .",
    "the model is constructed using conservation laws ( equations   and ) , fluid dynamics ( equation  ) , simplified pressure - volume relationships ( equations   and ) , and constitutive equations specific to the physiology of the kidney ( equations   and  ) .",
    "we assign values to the model parameters ( tables  [ tb:1 ] and [ tb:3 ] ) using experimental measurements when such measurements were available and previous modeling studies when direct measurements were not available . however , the data required for the flexibility parameters @xmath84 are sparse and do not suffice for an accurate estimation of their values . to that end , we choose to model these parameters as random variables with probability distributions that permit values spanning multiple orders of magnitude ( section  [ sec : params ] and figure  [ fig : lambda_pdfs ] ) .    to determine the probability distributions of the random variables , we define five histological groups within the model kidney",
    ". _ group g1 _ models thick and relatively inflexible structures , for which we use pressure - mass data obtained from whole kidneys in dogs @xcite .",
    "_ group g2 _ models the glomeruli , for which we use pressure - volume data measured in rats @xcite . _",
    "group g3 _ models the various segments of the nephrons and the proximal parts of the collecting duct , for which we use pressure - radius measurements of the rat proximal tubule @xcite . _ groups g4 and g5 _ model the blood vessels , for which we use pressure - volume measurements of the systemic circulation measured in rats @xcite .",
    "we combine the post - afferent arteriole vasculature in one group ( group g5 ) , despite that it consists of segments of the arterial and venous vascular trees @xcite .",
    "we are motivated to do so by the fact that these vascular segments have considerably thiner walls and therefore should be considerably more flexible than the pre - afferent arteriole segments @xcite .",
    "output from the model leads to a range of predictions depending on the choices of the flexibility values .",
    "generally , increased arterial blood pressure is predicted to increase the pressure in both interstitial spaces ( figure  [ fig : hist_7_factors ] ) . as arterial",
    "blood pressure increases from 100  mmhg to 180  mmhg , interstitial pressures are predicted to increase on average by @xmath683  mmhg .",
    "changes of similar magnitude have been observed in the kidneys of rats @xcite and dogs @xcite . upon a limited number of flexibility choices , however , the model predicts decreased interstitial pressures as a result .",
    "further , the model predicts a tight correlation between the cortical and the medullary pressures , figure  [ fig : corr_7_factors ] ( right panel ) , which is also in agreement with the experimental observations reported in @xcite . concerning the four case studies of section  [ sec : select ] ,",
    "cases 2 and 3 are in best agreement with the experimental observations in  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , case 4 deviates from the experimental observations .     and interstitial pressures @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "changes in @xmath50 are transmitted to @xmath19 and @xmath20 primarily by two pathways : one is mediated by afferent arteriole volumes ( @xmath151 , @xmath152 ) which is marked with red arrows , the other is mediated by pre - afferent arteriole volumes ( @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 ) and is marked with blue arrows .",
    "the two pathways have competing effects .",
    "secondary interactions are denoted with dashed lines . for simplicity , some of the secondary interactions are omitted . ]    as arterial blood pressure @xmath50 increases , mainly two distinct pathways that lead to interstitial pressure @xmath19 and @xmath20 changes can be identified ( figure  [ fig : block_summary ] ) .",
    "the first pathway ( denoted with red ) leads to _ increase _ of interstitial pressure upon constriction of the afferent arterioles .",
    "the second pathway ( denoted with blue ) leads to _ decrease _ of interstitial pressure upon dilation of the pre - afferent arteriole blood vessels .",
    "primarily , both pathways lead to changes in interstitial volumes @xmath69 and @xmath70 , which are subsequently transmitted to protein concentrations @xmath61 and @xmath62 , oncotic pressures @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and finally to @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the two pathways have competing effects ; the first leads to changes of @xmath19 and @xmath20 towards the same direction as @xmath50 , while the second leads to changes of @xmath19 and @xmath20 towards the opposite direction of @xmath50 .",
    "it is important to note that , in general , both pathways are active .",
    "however , the model results ( figure  [ fig : hist_7_factors ] ) indicate that under most circumstances the first pathway dominates over the second .",
    "the model predictions appear particularly sensitive to the flexibility of the pre - afferent arteriole blood vessels ( histological group g4 ) ( figure  [ fig : indices_7_factors ] ) .",
    "such behavior is attributed mostly to the fact that blood pressure is only regulated by the afferent arterioles , which are located after these vessels @xcite .",
    "the lack of pressure regulation , in the pre - afferent arteriole compartments , leads to larger internal pressure @xmath169 changes upon increases in arterial pressure @xmath50 than in the rest of the compartments .",
    "for example , as @xmath50 increases from 100  mmhg to 180  mmhg , assuming an increase in the interstitial pressures of @xmath685  mmhg , we see that the compartments of group g4 are stretched by a pressure difference of @xmath687075  mmhg , while the walls of the rest of the compartments are stretched by a pressure difference of @xmath685  mmhg .",
    "thus , in view of the pressure - volume relations given by equation   the resulting change in total kidney volume @xmath74 , which mediates the changes in interstitial pressures , is mostly affected by @xmath170 rather than @xmath171 , @xmath172 , @xmath173 , or @xmath174 .",
    "the model developed in this study uses several simplifications .",
    "for example , the current model assumes perfect autoregulation of blood flow for equations   , which limits its applicability to cases with arterial blood pressures between 80  mmhg and 180  mmhg @xcite .",
    "the model does not account for the differences in tubular reabsorption , e.g.  coefficients @xmath10 in , occurring between diuretic and antidiuretic animals or for pressure - diuretic responses @xcite .",
    "further , the model assumes linear pressure - volume relationships for equations   and .",
    "lifting those limitations requires a more detailed model , the development of which will be the focus of future studies . despite these limitations ,",
    "the present model could be a useful component in comprehensive models of renal physiology .",
