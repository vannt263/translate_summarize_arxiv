    "liquid helium is a unique system of strongly interacting atoms which becomes a quantum liquid ( helium  ii ) when the temperature is lower then some critical temperature @xmath2 .",
    "this critical temperature @xmath2 can be well estimated by two parameters : the de broglie thermal wavelength @xmath3 and the @xmath1-scattering length @xmath4    of the helium atoms .",
    "thus we may suppose that in liquid helium , a phase transition occurs to a quantum liquid when the de broglie thermal wavelength overlaps two nearest neighbors of helium atoms : @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the effective diameter of helium atoms .",
    "this equation yields the temperature @xmath7 , which is very close to the experimental value @xmath8 of the phase @xmath9-transition in liquid helium .",
    "the study of liquid helium  ii , and quantum liquids more generally , has been an active area of experimental and theoretical research ever since kapitza s @xcite discovery of the superfluidity in helium  ii .",
    "based on some experimental facts , landau  @xcite assumed that in liquid helium  ii there exist two types of elementary excitations : phonons and rotons .",
    "he also phenomenologically introduced the roton energy spectrum ( see eq.([1 ] ) ) to explain the thermodynamic behavior of liquid helium  ii .",
    "bogoliubov  @xcite first found theoretically the spectrum of quasi - particles in a dilute bose gas .",
    "this theory can be used for a bose gas when the temperature is close to zero , the particle density @xmath10 is low ( @xmath11 ) , and the wavenumbers of the particles are sufficiently small ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the relation between the energy spectrum of the elementary excitations of liquid @xmath13he and the structure factor of the liquid was found by feynman  @xcite .",
    "feynman also proposed a phenomenological model of the roton as a localized vortex ring with characteristic size of the order of the mean atomic distance in liquid helium  ii .",
    "the vortex rings were observed experimentally by rayfield and reif @xcite ; however , there has been no experimental confirmation that the vortex ring and roton are the same excitations in liquid helium .",
    "we also note that a variety of many - body theories have been applied to the problem since 1990 and a quantitative description of a roton has been obtained from variational integral equations , from a variational monte carlo method and by an imaginary time exact path integral .",
    "thus , a correct model of roton quasi - particles should be based on `` first principles '' and lead to quantitative agreement with experimental data .",
    "recently such a model was proposed in the paper  @xcite , where it was found that the roton is an excitation of a cluster of @xmath14 atoms , presumably having a central atom surrounded by a shell of @xmath15 atoms situated at the vertices of a regular icosahedron . in that paper",
    "we considered the number of atoms @xmath16 of the roton cluster as a fitting parameter that was found from the experimental data of yarnell _ et al _",
    "@xcite .",
    "in fact , the theory developed in @xcite does not need fitting to experimental data . to formulate this theory",
    "completely self - consistently we should find an additional equation for the chemical potential of roton excitations . in this paper",
    ", we calculate the vibrational energy spectrum of the roton cluster excitations with an arbitrary number of atoms in the cluster by the schrdinger - type equation with a self - consistent confining potential derived in @xcite .",
    "using scattering theory we have formulated the modified born approximation ( mba ) and have found the @xmath1-scattering length @xmath17 for helium atoms from the lennard - jones interatomic potential .",
    "we also derive in this paper the equation for the chemical potential @xmath18 of a roton cluster , which allows us to show that the smallest stable roton clusters in liquid helium  ii indeed contain @xmath14 atoms .",
    "moreover , we have found the numbers of atoms @xmath16 for the roton clusters which are in a vibrational state @xmath19 with arbitrary quantum numbers @xmath20 .",
    "this self - consistent approach allows us to accomplish all calculations for the parameters of the roton cluter excitations in helium  ii and leads to a quantitative agreement with experimental data .",
    "in particular , the roton clusters with @xmath21 are in the symmetric vibrational state @xmath22 and the energy spectrum of roton cluster excitations can be derived in the form  @xcite : @xmath23 which coincides with landau s empirical formula .",
    "the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) for roton cluster excitations can be derived by a hartree - fock variation procedure for the trial wave function @xmath24 where @xmath25 . in this procedure",
    "we represent the interaction potential by two parts : @xmath26 and @xmath27 , where @xmath26 is the repulsive part and @xmath27 is the attractive part . the repulsive part of this potential can be approximated by a hard sphere potential , @xmath28 and the attractive part ( the confining many - body effective potential ) is @xmath29 the parameters @xmath30 are found by the stationarity conditions @xmath31 ( see below ) .",
    "this potential takes into account all forces between @xmath32 atoms of the cluster and those of the surroundings , and also long - range many - body attractive forces among atoms of the cluster  @xcite .",
    "this hartree - fock variation procedure directly leads to a nlse : @xmath33 here the normalisation condition for the wave function @xmath34 has the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the roton cluster volume and the parameters @xmath30 are given by eq.([3 ] ) . because eq.([e1 ] ) follows from a hartree - fock variational procedure the number of atoms forming the roton cluster should satisfy the condition @xmath37 ( not necessarily @xmath38 ) . but below we will suppose the spherical symmetry of the roton clusters , which can only be accurate with a large number of atoms ( for example one may demand @xmath39 ) .    despite its",
    "apparently similar form , equation ( [ e1 ] ) should not be confused with the well - known gross - pitaevskii equation  @xcite .",
    "both contain the same hard - sphere repulsive potential to describe short - range collisional interactions .",
    "however , in the gross - pitaevski equation the attractive harmonic potential , if present , describes an external trap ; in equation ( [ e1 ] ) the harmonic @xmath27 is a effective long - range many - body interaction , found by the variational procedure .",
    "thus while the gross - pitaevski equation is only valid in the limit of low particle density , @xmath40 , and small wavenumbers , @xmath12 , equation ( [ e1 ] ) remains valid at high densities , @xmath41 , provided @xmath42 ( or more precisely , provided @xmath43 ) . in the limit when @xmath44 and @xmath45 the confining many - body potential @xmath27 vanishes and equation ( [ e1 ] ) does",
    "becomes just the gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "equation ( [ e1 ] ) is semiclassical , and as mentioned above , all phenomena in helium ii , including roton excitations , should be described quantum mechanically .",
    "we present below a quantisation procedure for the nlse based on a self - similar solution .    following the method of  @xcite ( for",
    "the @xmath46 case see  @xcite ) it can be shown that this nlse ( [ e1 ] ) has a self - similar solution when the dimensionless parameter @xmath47 $ ] satisfies the condition @xmath48 .",
    "evidently , this is true for @xmath49 because in this case @xmath50 , and even for @xmath51 we find that this parameter is small enough : @xmath52 .",
    "further , we have already shown  @xcite that the self - similar evolution of the atoms in the roton clusters described by the nlse ( [ e1 ] ) can be derived from a hamiltonian in the space of the ellipsoidal coordinates of the roton cluster : @xmath53 where @xmath54 are the canonical momenta , @xmath55 are the ellipsoidal coordinates , and @xmath56 is the renormalized mass .",
    "the interaction constant @xmath57 and the parameters @xmath30 of the self - consistent confining potential @xmath58 of the roton cluster in eq.([2 ] ) are given by  @xcite : @xmath59 the quantisation of the hamiltonian  ( [ 2 ] ) yields a schrdinger equation for the roton wave function @xmath60  : @xmath61 where the potential @xmath62 has the form @xmath63 the parameters @xmath30 must satisfy the stationarity conditions @xmath31 , which just yield eq.([3 ] ) again .",
    "we note that the equation ( [ 4 ] ) is not the standard schrdinger equation because it given in the space of ellipsoidal parameters @xmath55 .",
    "this schrdinger type equation can be solved by an expansion of the potential energy ( [ 5 ] ) in a series with the variable @xmath64 , subject to the condition @xmath65 . in the quadratic approximation",
    "we find @xmath66 where the constant @xmath67 and the matrix @xmath68 are given by @xmath69 the eigenvectors @xmath70 of the matrix @xmath68 obey @xmath71 where the second equation is just the normalisation condition .",
    "thus the coordinate transformation @xmath72 is orthogonal . using eqs.([6]-[9 ] ) , we can now write the schrdinger equation ( [ 5 ] ) as @xmath73 we note that the energy spectrum of eq.([10 ] ) does not depend on the renormalized mass @xmath74 ( which for some problems can be redefined  @xcite ) . here",
    "the eigenfrequencies @xmath75 are given by equation @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the identity matrix , or , in explicit form , @xmath78 this allows us to find the eigenfunctions @xmath79 and eigenenergies @xmath80 by @xmath81 where the hamiltonian @xmath82 is that defined by the schrdinger equation ( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "these eigenfunctions @xmath79 are @xmath83 where @xmath84 are hermite polynomials and @xmath85 .",
    "the eigenenergies in eq.([12 ] ) have the form @xmath86 where @xmath87 at @xmath88 are the quantum numbers of a 3d quantum harmonic oscillator .",
    "assuming now spherical symmetry of the roton clusters , we find @xmath89 ( for @xmath88 ) where @xmath90 is given by  @xcite : @xmath91 here @xmath92 is the particle density of liquid helium , giving @xmath93   .",
    "for example , in the case @xmath21 we have @xmath94   .",
    "we note that the value of the parameter @xmath95 defined by the particle density @xmath10 of liquid helium is very close to the value of the @xmath1-scattering length @xmath4    for the helium atoms . from eq.([15 ] ) it also follows that @xmath96 when @xmath97 , so the physical sense of the parameter @xmath95 is the same as that of @xmath17 : an effective radius of the helium atoms .    in this spherically symmetric case eq.([11 ] ) yields the eigenfrequencies @xmath98 , @xmath99 . here",
    "the frequency @xmath100^{1/2}\\hbar m^{-1}\\bar{a}^{-5/2}$ ] follows from eq.([3 ] ) when @xmath89 for @xmath101 .",
    "let us define the energy of a symmetric excitation @xmath102 and the energy of an asymmetric excitation @xmath103 . then , taking into account eq.([15 ] ) , we find @xmath104",
    "at first we consider in detail the calculation of the @xmath1-scattering length @xmath17 for helium atoms based on the lennard - jones intermolecular potential .",
    "the schrdinger equation for the @xmath1-scattering wave and appropriate boundary conditions are : @xmath105 @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the wavenumber , @xmath108 is the radial @xmath1-scattering wavefunction , @xmath109 is the phase shift of the @xmath1-scattering wave , @xmath110 is the reduced mass , and @xmath111 is the scattering potential . defining the @xmath1-wave scattering length as usual by @xmath112 $ ] , we can write it in the form  @xcite : @xmath113 ( with the appropriate normalisation condition for the wave function )",
    ". when the born approximation is valid one can make in eq.([19 ] ) the substitution @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the wave function of free particle .",
    "however , for slow particles this approximation is generally meaningless  @xcite because of divergence of the integral in eq.([19 ] ) . in the case",
    "@xmath116 we can instead formulate a modified born approximation ( mba ) , based on the substitution @xmath117 in eq.([19 ] ) , where @xmath118 is the heaviside step function .",
    "thus we suppose that the wave function is zero when @xmath119 ( i.e. the region @xmath119 is unattainable for a slow particle ) .",
    "this leads to the equation : @xmath120 for example , let us consider intermolecular interactions with the potential @xmath121 where @xmath122 .",
    "eq.([20 ] ) then yields @xmath123 the exact solution of eqs.([17],[18 ] ) for this potential leads to an equation which differs from eq.([21 ] ) only in the coefficient : @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is the gamma function .",
    "note that in the born approximation the integral diverges in eq.([19 ] ) .",
    "for example , at @xmath126 we find @xmath127 in the mba and @xmath128 in the exact solution ; at @xmath129 we have @xmath130 in the mba and @xmath131 in the exact solution .",
    "we note that the mba leads to the most accurate results when the potential @xmath111 has some characteristic length @xmath132 where @xmath133 .",
    "it asymptotically leads to the exact solutions for exactly integrable model potentials when @xmath134 .",
    "the condition @xmath133 does hold for helium intermolecular interactions given by the lennard - jones potential : @xmath135 $ ] . in this case calculating the integral in eq.([20 ] ) one can find a fifth order algebraic equation : @xmath136 where @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "we use in this paper the parameters of the intermolecular lennard - jones potential for helium atoms calculated by a self - consistent - field hartree - fock method  @xcite : @xmath139 and @xmath140   , where @xmath141 . for these values",
    "we find from eq.([22 ] ) that @xmath142 , and @xmath143   .",
    "taking into account the limited accuracy of our calculations we will assume in this paper that @xmath4    @xcite , which is very close to the result based on this mba method .",
    "let us denote @xmath144 the energy per particle of the roton cluster in the ground state and @xmath145 the energy per particle of ground state of the bulk . then taking into account that the energy of a bound state of two particles in the roton cluster is given by @xmath146 ( to within some additive constant @xmath147 ) and the energy of two particles in the ground state of the bulk is @xmath148 ( to within an additive constant @xmath147 ) we can find @xmath149 where @xmath147 is the contribution of the bulk to the ground state of the roton cluster . here",
    "@xmath111 is the lennard - jones potential .",
    "thus the chemical potential @xmath18 and the gap @xmath150 of the roton cluster are  : @xmath151 the equation @xmath152 is fulfilled because from eq.([1 ] ) it follows that @xmath153 . using the above definitions one can find the positive parameter @xmath154 $ ] which yields @xmath155 .",
    "thus from eq.([24 ] ) follows that @xmath156 .",
    "this value coincides to three decimal places with the experimental value of the roton gap  @xcite : @xmath157 .",
    "because @xmath145 is the energy per particle of the ground state of the bulk we can write @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the ground energy of the bulk and @xmath160 is the number of atoms in the bulk .",
    "the ground state energy per particle @xmath145 in the helium bulk can be found via the diffusion monte carlo method  @xcite : @xmath161 .",
    "this yields the bulk parameter @xmath162 .",
    "the equation @xmath163 holds only for the symmetric roton cluster excitation  @xcite with vibrational quantum numbers @xmath164 and @xmath165 . in the general case ,",
    "the roton cluster excitations with arbitrary vibrational quantum numbers satisfy the generalised equation for the number of atoms @xmath166 in the roton cluster : @xmath167 , where @xmath168 . hence , combining eqs.([14 ] ) and ( [ 24 ] ) we find the generalised equation for the number of atoms @xmath166 in the roton cluster in the form @xmath169     ( left side in ( [ 27 ] ) ) .",

    "we can write eq.([26 ] ) in explicit form @xmath179 where again @xmath180 , and @xmath181 . eq.([27 ] ) is equivalent to a fifth order algebraic equation for the variable @xmath16 .",
    "we can formulate the stability conditions of the roton cluster as @xmath182 and @xmath183 , where we are considering here the number of atoms @xmath16 in the roton cluster as a variable parameter . combining these equations with eq.([4 ] ) and",
    "eq.([15 ] ) one can rewrite these two stability conditions in the form @xmath184 where @xmath185 is given by eq.([16 ] ) and @xmath186  is the thermal de broglie wavelength of a helium atom .",
