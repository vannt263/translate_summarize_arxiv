    "the study of cross - cultural experiences through mass - mediated contact is a topic of much interest in the social sciences @xcite .",
    "many of those studies have focused on the effects of cultural product consumption on audience beliefs , emotions , and attitudes toward the group originating these cultural products .",
    "for instance , several works have investigated the process by which international audiences develop american values , norms and stereotypes about america through the experience of watching american television series @xcite .",
    "other works have explored the political impact of international television across borders @xcite .",
    "the expansion of broadcasting and telecommunication industries in recent times has led to an increase in the exchange of mass media products across countries and social groups . as a consequence , people of different groups that may have had little direct contact with each other can , however , have access to their reciprocal mass media messages .",
    "for example , the growth of media channels in east asia has brought changing patterns of cultural consumption : younger generations in china are drawn to korean pop stars ; korean people have begun to collect chinese films ; japanese audiences await the broadcast of non - japanese asian dramas @xcite .    in the current research in complex systems , there is also much interest in the investigation of models of social dynamics @xcite .",
    "many of these systems have provided scenarios for investigating new forms of interactions and for studying new collective phenomena in non - equilibrium systems @xcite . in this context , the model introduced by axelrod @xcite to investigate the dissemination of culture among interacting agents in a society has attracted much attention from physicists @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the agent - agent interaction rule is such that no interaction exists for some relative values characterizing the states of the agents that compose the system .",
    "this type of interaction is common in social and biological systems where there is often some bound or restriction for the occurrence of interaction between agents , such as a similarity condition for the state variable @xcite .",
    "in particular , the effects of local and global mass media on a social group have been studied by using axelrod s model @xcite . some different formalisms for mass media based on axelrod s model have also been proposed @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the problem of cross - cultural interactions through mass media in a model where two separated social groups , each with its own internal dynamics , get information about each other solely through reciprocal global interactions .",
    "we address the question of whether two societies subject to reciprocal mass media interactions become more similar to each other or if they can mantain some diversity .",
    "specifically , our system consists of two populations of social agents whose dynamics is described by axelrod s model , mutually coupled through global interactions .",
    "the global interactions act as fields that can be interpreted as mass media @xcite . in our model ,",
    "the mass media content reaching one population corresponds to the statistical mode or cultural trend originated in the other population , and viceversa .",
    "the existence of non - interacting states in the dynamics , as well as the competition between the time scales of local agent - agent interactions and the responses of the endogenous global fields , lead to nontrivial collective behaviors , such as the emergence of a largest minority group in a population , sharing a state different from that of the applied global field , and the occurrence of localized ordered states . in this last case , one population reaches a homogeneous state while several states coexist on the other .",
    "this situation can be considered as a social analogue to a chimera state arising in globally coupled populations of oscillators @xcite .    in sec .  1 we present the model for two interacting populations of social agents and characterize the collective behavior on the space of parameters of the system .",

    "<S> we investigate the problem of cross - cultural interactions through mass media in a model where two populations of social agents , each with its own internal dynamics , get information about each other through reciprocal global interactions . as the agent dynamics , we employ axelrod s model for social influence . </S>",
    "<S> the global interaction fields correspond to the statistical mode of the states of the agents and represent mass media messages on the cultural trend originating in each population . </S>",
    "<S> several phases are found in the collective behavior of either population depending on parameter values : two homogeneous phases , one having the state of the global field acting on that population , and the other consisting of a state different from that reached by the applied global field ; and a disordered phase . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the system displays nontrivial effects : ( i ) the emergence of a largest minority group of appreciable size sharing a state different from that of the applied global field ; ( ii ) the appearance of localized ordered states for some values of parameters when the entire system is observed , consisting of one population in a homogeneous state and the other in a disordered state . </S>",
    "<S> this last situation can be considered as a social analogue to a chimera state arising in globally coupled populations of oscillators . </S>"
