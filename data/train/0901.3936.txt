    "in recent years there has been a growing interest in the possibility that the metallic phase of cuprate superconductors has an instability towards microscopically phase - separated charge and spin inhomogeneities @xcite and that this instability might be related to the high temperature superconductivity ( htsc ) itself @xcite . in an inhomogeneity picture ,",
    "the modulated charges ( stripes ) could in principle support either superconductivity or charge density wave @xcite . when the stripes are static , charge density wave overwhelms .",
    "however , if the stripes are dynamic , the charge fluctuations might suppress the charge density wave and open a pseudogap that serves as a precursor for superconductivity .",
    "this nanometer - scale phase instability could lead to a strong spin - charge - phonon coupling , giving possible evidence of unconventional electron - phonon coupling in htsc .",
    "the existence of static stripes is now generally accepted due to the observation of inhomogeneous charge distribution in certain compounds such as la@xmath5nd@xmath6sr@xmath3cuo@xmath4 and la@xmath7ba@xmath8cuo@xmath4 @xcite . however , dynamic stripes  which are particularly important  are not easily and unambiguously detectable . due to the absence of a clear experimental signature ,",
    "the possible existence of dynamic inhomogeneous state has been difficult to establish @xcite .",
    "so far , dynamic inhomogeneity has been suggested by the observation of a second order parameter well above @xmath9 .",
    "for example , a multi - component response , as a sign of dynamic inhomogeneous state in la@xmath10sr@xmath3cuo@xmath4 has been consistently observed in different experiments , such as muon - spin rotation , scanning tunneling spectroscopy , and angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy @xcite . in a recent inelastic scattering study , reznik @xmath11 @xmath12 .",

    "however , inelastic scattering measurements do not yield direct information on  modulated \" cu - o bond distances .",
    "clearly , if the charge is inhomogeneously distributed in the cuo@xmath13 plane , such that some copper sites have more charge than others , a modulation of in - plane cu - o bond length would occur .",

    "we present an accurate determination of the in - plane cu - o bond length modulation by detecting the cu - o atomic displacements .",
    "splitting of the in - plane cu - o bond distance below a characteristic temperature @xmath14 is clearly present , providing a solid evidence for the existence of local lattice instability in optimally - doped la@xmath10sr@xmath3cuo@xmath4 .",

    "in contrast , below a characteristic temperature @xmath14 ( @xmath14@xmath1880 k ) , it exhibits a remarkable upturn , indicating the occurrence of local lattice distortion @xcite .",
    "previously , a similar local lattice distortion was found and explained by using a two - componen model where a distorted local low temperature tetragonal ( ltt ) lattice coexists with the undistorted local low temperature orthorhombic ( lto ) lattice @xcite . in this study",

    "this result suggests that the out - of - plane cu - o bond is not involved in the local lattice instability , i.e. , the local lattice distortion occurs within the cuo@xmath13 plane .",

    "the local lattice instability below @xmath14@xmath18 80 k is described by the in - plane cu - o bond splitting . due to the well - known fact that there is no static lattice / charge modulation in optimally - doped la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath4 and the failure to detect the inhomogeneous state by any slow techniques",

    "lattice instability at this length scale is expected to produce exotic lattice dynamical properties such as a certain kind of phonon mode softening and strong coupling between the lattice and charge degrees of freedom , leading to polaron formation .",
    "regarding the specific nature of the polaron , two different types of cu - o bond stretching modes can be considered as possible candidates : the pseudo - jahn - teller mode @xcite ; and the @xmath41-type mode @xcite .",
    "these modes are schematized in fig .",
    "below @xmath9 , the beat feature is weakened but it is still clearly discernible , which indicates the persistence of dynamic lattice instability below @xmath9 .",
    "incidentally the sharp decrease of the local cu - o lattice displacements was found in ion channeling experiments , where a drop of the variable amplitude at @xmath24 was detected @xcite .",
    "these results indicate that the vibration of planar oxygen becomes silent as the superconducting transition occurs .",
    "we conclude that the decrease in vibration is due to the transition of the cuo@xmath13 planar lattice dynamics from an incoherent state to a coherent state as the pairing occurs .      besides",
    "the characterization of the in - plane cu - o bond local lattice instability in la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath4 , another important topic is whether or not and how this local lattice instability relates to the nature of the superconductivity in this system . in the following we investigate some specific perturbations of the local lattice instability by impurity doping .",
    "we have used three different transition metal elements ( mn , ni , and co ) to replace the cu in the la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath4 parent compound .",

    "in all mn - doped samples , the upturn of @xmath31@xmath33 occurs below @xmath14@xmath1880 k. in ni - doped samples , the @xmath14 slightly decreases .",
    "for example , the @xmath14 value is about 70 k in 3% ni - doped sample .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the drop of @xmath31@xmath33 occurs at @xmath24 .",
    "thus it is clear that the upturn of @xmath31@xmath33 below @xmath14 is due to the occurrence of local lattice instability while the drop of @xmath31@xmath33 below @xmath24 is due to the superconducting phase coherence . using two simple equations we can roughly estimate the magnitudes of the upturn part and the drop part :    @xmath50    @xmath51    where @xmath31@xmath52 represents the contribution of local lattice instability to the total @xmath31@xmath33 , and @xmath31@xmath53 is due to the phase coherence below @xmath9 . using eqs .",

    "8(c ) one can see that @xmath31@xmath52 has the largest magnitude in the optimum superconductor la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath4 .",
    "with increasing mn doping , the magnitude of @xmath31@xmath52 slightly decreases but the contribution from @xmath31@xmath52 persists in all samples up to @xmath16=0.05 , indicating that mn doping does not suppress the local lattice instability .",
    "on the other hand , the contribution of @xmath31@xmath52 decreases rapidly in the ni- and co - doped samples . with 5% of ni(co)-doping the upturn of @xmath31@xmath33",
    "is completely smeared out , indicating that the local lattice instabilities are strongly suppressed by ni and co dopants .",
    "8(d ) plots the magnitude of the drop of @xmath31@xmath33 due to the superconducting phase coherence below @xmath24 .",

    "it is interesting to notice that in mn - doped samples , the drop in @xmath31@xmath33 is observed in all samples , despite the decrease in magnitude .    on the basis of these results",
    "we can draw the conclusion that the mn - doped samples favor the local lattice instability while the ni and co dopants are strongly harmful to the local lattice instability .",
    "the perturbation of local lattice instability is related to the suppression of superconductivity induced by impurity doping .",
    "that is , the introduction of ni and co dopants strongly suppresses the local lattice instability and thus severely suppresses the superconducting transition .",
    "in contrast to the ni and co dopants , the mn dopants cause less perturbation on the local lattice instability , resulting in a constant onset superconducting transition temperature .",
    "it is reasonable to imagine that in mn - doped samples , the introduction of mn dopants leads to the separation of the superconducting domains . near the mn dopants ,",
    "regions of non - superconducting domains are formed . with increasing mn doping ,",
    "more and more non - superconducting regions are formed and large superconducting domains could be divided into small superconducting droplets . as the distance between the superconducting droplets becomes large , the tunneling is prohibited and the superconductivity disappears .",
