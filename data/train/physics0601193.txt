    "the basic natural modes of magnetized plasmas such as those that occur in molecular clouds , cometary plasmas and stellar atmospheres are of great interest .",
    "when the frequencies are low then a class of linear waves , referred to collectively as alfvn waves , are known to exist and are of importance to the understanding of many basic plasma phenomena @xcite .",
    "the linear approximation to these waves breaks down at large amplitudes where nonlinear effects become important in their propagation .",
    "one such large amplitude wave is a magnetoacoustic wave , which modifies the background magnetic field in an oscillatory fashion , and so can be considered as a pump wave that drives other waves nonlinearly .",
    "such large - amplitude pump waves may occur in conditions such as seen in solar and space plasmas .",
    "for example , solar shock waves can set up large amplitude standing magnetoacoustic waves in coronal loops or magnetic flux tubes @xcite .    by considering perturbations of this large amplitude pump",
    ", we can investigate the possibility of exciting natural modes of the system , such as alfvn waves , due to a resonant interaction between the pump wave and the natural waves . in the single ion species case",
    "this basic phenomenon was predicted by @xcite , and subsequently pursued by several authors @xcite . for a pump magnetic field parallel to the background magnetic field in a single ion species plasma ,",
    "the excited waves are alfvn waves travelling in opposite directions along the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "if ion - cyclotron effects are included , the excited waves are the fast and slow ( ion  cyclotron ) alfvn waves travelling in opposite directions @xcite .",
    "more general behavior is allowed in the case where the excited waves are permitted to travel obliquely to the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the parametric excitation of waves in a dusty magnetized plasma has been investigated in ref.@xcite , but in the approximation where the dust is taken to be immobile . in that case",
    "the oppositely travelling pair of waves are modified , with the presence of a cutoff frequency in the fast alfvn wave .",
    "furthermore , an interaction between a pair of fast waves or a pair of slow waves was found to exist .",
    "the corresponding growth rates of the slow - fast and fast - fast pairs were maximized as a function of the dust concentration .",
    "many space and laboratory plasmas are multicomponent , i.e. , contain multiple ion species .",
    "it is therefore of great interest to investigate the effects of the additional species on the linear and nonlinear properties of the waves in the plasma .",
    "for instance , it is often the case that in the presence of an additional ion component an extra mode is excited , or forbidden regions of frequency are introduced .",
    "one area of study of multi - ion plasmas is the bi - ion plasma .",
    "the inclusion of one extra ion species often captures the basic information of several extra species .",
    "the bi - ion plasma has particular importance in plasma fusion , laboratory plasmas and in astrophysical environments , with the secondary ion usually positively charged .",
    "a dusty plasma adds another level of interest to the topic of multicomponent plasmas , due to the dust properties .",
    "dust is an additional impurity of large mass and often of negative charge . under the simplest approximation ,",
    "all the dust grains may be considered to have the same mass and equilibrium charge , and so are equivalent to a second ion species .",
    "this is the case considered in this paper .",
    "it is known that the inclusion of dust in a plasma may introduce cutoff frequencies into the basic alfvn waves , and introduce a low frequency mode , whose nature is different from that in a bi - ion plasma due to the dust grain s extremely high mass @xcite .",
    "qualitative differences to the bi - ion case arise when charge perturbations of the grains are included , leading to an additional damping mechanism @xcite , or when a spectrum of dust grain sizes and charges is allowed for @xcite .",
    "dust is found , in varying amounts , in many astrophysical and space environments such as molecular clouds and the rings of saturn .",
    "dusty plasmas have also been studied closely experimentally , since the heavy grain mass introduces low frequency effects that may be studied in real time .",
    "an immediate consequence of the presence of an additional ion species is its modification of the background free - electron number density .",
    "this influences the propagation of plasma and electromagnetic waves @xcite .",
    "if in the case of a dusty plasma we fix the grain charge , then the grain becomes entirely defined in terms of its mass and charge , and as such acts just like another ion in the plasma ( albeit of negative charge ) .",
    "the state of charge neutrality may be written as : @xmath0 here @xmath1 is the number density of plasma electrons ( with the charge @xmath2 ) , and the two ion species ( of signed charge @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) , respectively . for laboratory dusty plasmas ,",
    "the grain charge is negative ( i.e. , @xmath5 ) and large ( @xmath6 ) , so that an appreciable proportion of the negative charge in the plasma may reside on the dust particles . for astrophysical dusty plasmas ,",
    "@xmath7 may only be of the order of unity , which is often the case for a canonical bi - ion plasma . in environments such as the interstellar medium , where the dust grain is in an electron - proton plasma with little ultra - violet radiation present , the dust grains acquire a negative charge .",
    "on the other hand , exposure to ultraviolet light from nearby stars can cause ionization of the grains , leaving a residual positive charge .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the propagation of plane hydromagnetic waves ( alfvn waves and magnetoacoustic waves modified by the presence of a secondary ion or dust species in a bi - ion plasma ) , propagating parallel to the pumped magnetic field of a large amplitude magnetoacoustic wave .",
    "we generalize ref.@xcite where the second heavy space was assumed immobile , to the case where both ions are fully mobile .",
    "a further generalization is the inclusion of pressure .",
    "the background magnetic field and plasma density are taken to be uniform , at frequencies well below the electron plasma and cyclotron frequencies .",
    "first , we find the dispersion equation of the pump wave , and then concentrate on pump waves of large wavelength . we then obtain a coupled pair of equations of motion governing the perturbed plasma .",
    "resonant interactions are sought , and growth rates of the waves parametrically excited by the pump are calculated and discussed .",
    "the most general set of equations used to describe two mobile ion - like species , plus electrons , is a three - fluid model . in this picture",
    "we employ three momentum equations for the electrons and the two ion species , where we include both the ions inertia terms , while ignoring the electron inertia .",
    "this is valid if the frequencies of interest are well below the electron cyclotron frequency .",
    "in addition we use maxwell s equations and two mass continuity equations for each of the ion species , ignoring maxwell s displacement current .",
    "the primary species ( assumed positively charged ) shall be denoted with a  1 \" subscript , and the secondary species ( either positively or negatively charged ) shall be denoted with a  2 \" subscript . in this notation",
    "we may write the current density as @xmath8 where the two ion species and electrons have velocities denoted by @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "we employ the parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 , which measure the distribution of charge in the plasma amongst the ions . employing the total charge neutrality condition , given in eq.([movequil ] ) , we may write this as @xmath14 in terms of these parameters .",
    "note that in the limit of a single ( primary ) ion species , we have @xmath15 and @xmath16 .    ignoring collisions , but including the effects of pressure , the starting equations for the velocities , electric and magnetic fields and each number density are the momentum equations , the two ion continuity equations , and ampere s law neglecting the displacement current : @xmath17 here , @xmath18 are the two heavy species and electron pressures , and @xmath19 are the heavy masses . the magnetic field @xmath20 includes the background magnetic field @xmath21 .    finally , by assuming either an isothermal or an adiabatic equation of state , we have @xmath22 for each species , where @xmath23 are the individual sound speeds . though it is not imperative , we shall assume isothermal changes , which permits us to write down @xmath23 in terms of the plasma temperatures , i.e. , @xmath24 is the square of each thermal speed , where @xmath25 is each temperature and @xmath26 is boltzmann s constant .    at this point",
    "we choose to eliminate the electron variables from eqs.([movi])([movmax2 ] ) , and use faraday s law to eliminate the electric field @xmath27 .",
    "there are then two choices for the way to proceed .",
    "we can add and subtract the momentum equations and deal with a total fluid velocity and the current density @xmath28 .",
    "instead we shall employ the most direct method , which is to deal with the ion velocities @xmath9 and @xmath10 separately , since our equations will exhibit the most symmetry this way . by employing the charge neutrality condition to all orders , the following system of nonlinear partial differential equations",
    "is found : @xmath29 in eqs.([movcont])([moveuld ] ) @xmath30 are the densities of each massive component of the plasma and @xmath31 are the corresponding ( signed ) cyclotron frequencies , with @xmath32 .",
    "also @xmath33 and @xmath34 are pseudo - squared thermal speeds associated with the electron pressure ( if @xmath35 we allow @xmath36 to be imaginary ) .",
    "the presence of both @xmath37 and @xmath38 in both equations of motion , is a consequence of the elimination of the electron variables from the equations . to be more explicit ,",
    "the electron density fluctuations generate fluctuations in both the ion densities through the charge neutrality condition , which produces this coupling in the momentum equations . the second term on the right hand side of eq.([movmag1 ] )",
    "is the hall term ; it is important when the wave frequency is comparable to either of the cyclotron frequencies .",
    "also , we see that the two species are strongly coupled through the momentum equations , via the third term on the right hand side in each .",
    "this is an additional hall - type term associated with the relative motion of the two species .",
    "note eqs.([movcont])([moveul ] ) reduce , in the case of a single species plasma ( @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the wave frequency and @xmath41 are the alfvn speeds associated with each ion .",
    "the charge neutrality condition implies that the wave frequencies are restricted to the regime @xmath42 , which may be restated as @xmath43 there exists a wide range of physical environments for which all of the above mentioned conditions are met .",
    "suppose there is a constant background magnetic field in the @xmath44-direction , given by @xmath45 .",
    "we now periodically pump the field , with a periodic modulation : @xmath46\\hat{{\\bf z } } , \\label{movinitb}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the pump frequency . here",
    "@xmath48 is a constant dimensionless quantity which determines the amplitude of the pump .",
    "more precisely , @xmath48 is an expansion parameter , which permits us to keep track of our terms , by matching powers of @xmath48 .",
    "the parameter @xmath49 on the other hand is a dimensionless quantity that we include to capture any necessary frequency information , i.e. , @xmath50 , such that the average of @xmath49 over @xmath47 is @xmath51 . by specifying a particular choice of normalization condition",
    ", we may solve for @xmath49 .",
    "we later in fact impose the condition that the energy density in the pump system is a constant over @xmath52 , and calculate the resulting @xmath49 .",
    "since we are interested in a large amplitude pump wave , @xmath48 will typically be @xmath53 .",
    "however , since this field has no spatial dependence , it does not satisfy our wave equations .",
    "hence this is an approximation to a wave with a large wavelength .",
    "we must therefore modify the pump with an envelope of some wavelength . since the pump wave magnetic field points in the @xmath44-direction , the wavevector should point perpendicular to this to satisfy @xmath54 . for a planar geometry plasma ,",
    "we choose the axes such that the wave varies in the @xmath55-direction , with wavenumber @xmath56 . by denoting the pump magnetic field ( and all subsequent pump fields ) with a  0 \" superscript , we have @xmath57\\hat{\\bf z}. \\label{movpump}\\ ] ] in a cylindrical plasma , with @xmath58 denoting the radial distance from the cylindrical axis , we have @xmath59\\hat{\\bf z } , \\label{movpumpj}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the 0th order bessel function of the first kind .",
    "note that @xmath61 in eqs.([movpump ] ) and ( [ movpumpj ] ) .    in the absence of a wave",
    ", we shall suppose that the plasma is stationary , with ion densities @xmath62 and charge ratios of @xmath63 .",
    "the effect of pumping will be to modify the velocity , density and charge imbalance to order @xmath48 , so that @xmath64 these quantities define the pump wave , and we now proceed to solve the equations ( [ movcont])([moveuld ] ) to order @xmath48 ( i.e. , the linear solution ) .    by inspecting the form of the magnetic field in eq.([movpump ] ) [ or ( [ movpumpj ] ) ] , and eqs.([moveul ] ) and ( [ moveuld ] )",
    ", we note that the velocity can not have a @xmath44-component .",
    "hence , the velocities of the ion species must be of the form @xmath65 for planar waves . from the resulting pair of equations we ascertain the form of each velocity component and density : @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are amplitudes independent of space and time , to be determined . then , from the continuity equations , we have @xmath69    for the cylindrical plasma case , we make the substitutions : @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the azimuthal angle and @xmath75 is the 1st order bessel function of the first kind .",
    "then it is found that all the relationships ( [ movtransvel])([movconamp ] ) still hold .",
    "it follows that the modes in the planar and cylindrical plasmas satisfy the same dispersion equation .    upon substitution of eqs.([movv_x])([movconamp ] ) into eqs.([movcont])([moveuld ] ) , written to first order in @xmath48 , the following dispersion equation of the pump wave is obtained : @xmath76 here , we have defined @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a hybrid cutoff frequency as @xmath79 .",
    "also we have introduced @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 which allow us to specify the cold / warm plasma regimes , with @xmath84 and @xmath85 related through : @xmath86 .",
    "note that as @xmath87 ( i.e. , a single species ) we are left with the nondispersive relation @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the combined sound speed in this limit .",
    "this is the familiar fast magnetoacoustic wave characteristic for @xmath90 .",
    "however , in the presence of a secondary ion species the fast magnetoacoustic wave gains an additional mode and the relationship is dispersive , see fig.[mov1 ] .     versus normalized pump wavenumber @xmath91 with @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "( a ) the warm plasma , with @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "( b ) the cold plasma , with @xmath96.,width=377 ]     versus normalized pump wavenumber @xmath91 with @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "( a ) the warm plasma , with @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "( b ) the cold plasma , with @xmath96.,width=377 ]    it is easy to show that the parameters @xmath97 and @xmath98 are always positive , while @xmath99 for the cold plasma and is positive if any of @xmath100 are nonzero .",
    "although fig.[mov1 ] is for a plasma in which the secondary ion species is positive , the same basic qualitative features are present when the second ion species is negative . for the warm plasma",
    "the effect of the @xmath101 term in the dispersion relation is to cause the lower branch to increase without bound as @xmath102 , as indicated in fig.[mov1](a ) .",
    "physically , it can be thought of as the fast magnetoacoustic mode being converted into an acoustic mode for large @xmath56 due to the inclusion of pressure .",
    "however , if the plasma is cold ( i.e. , @xmath99 ) then the lower branch experiences a resonance as @xmath102 , as indicated in fig.[mov1](b ) . in this limit @xmath97 becomes the square of a resonance frequency , given by @xmath103 which gives rise to a forbidden frequency region between @xmath104 and @xmath78 , since @xmath105 whenever @xmath106 .",
    "the ratio of the @xmath55-velocity amplitudes @xmath107 to the magnetic field parameter @xmath49 are of particular importance to our later discussion , so we briefly discuss them here . in terms of the frequency and wavenumber ,",
    "we find , @xmath108 where @xmath109 finally , to complete the set of pump quantities , we find that the velocity in the @xmath110-direction is given by @xmath111 with @xmath112 given similarly .",
    "this is quite different to the single ion species case , where @xmath113 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath114 is dramatically altered by the choice of branch from the dispersion relation ; see fig.[mov2 ] , where for brevity we plot @xmath115 only .",

    "the solid curve is for the upper branch of the dispersion relation , the dashed curve is for the lower branch of the dispersion relation .",
    "note that on the vertical axis we plot the absolute value of this ratio , since we are interested here in the ratio of _",
    "consequently one of the two dashed curves experiences a discontinuity in its first derivative when it touches the horizontal axis.,width=377 ]    we see that as @xmath119 , the @xmath55-component approaches a finite positive value while the @xmath110-component approaches zero for the upper branch of the dispersion relation . on the other hand the @xmath55-component approaches large values and the @xmath110-component passes through zero for the lower branch of the dispersion relation .",
    "note that the two branches stemming from the upper branch of the dispersion relation become singular as @xmath120 .",
    "this motivates the need for a normalization condition relating the pump field amplitudes of the velocities @xmath67 , magnetic field @xmath49 , and density @xmath68 .",
    "a reasonable way to proceed is to assume that as we vary @xmath47 the energy density @xmath121 in the pump system is fixed .",
    "the appropriate relation in a fluid description for general magnetoacoustic waves is ( e.g.  @xcite ) , @xmath122 where @xmath123 , and the summation in the final term is over each plasma species . in our approximations the electric energy term",
    "may be neglected compared to the magnetic energy . by switching to dimensionless units and setting @xmath124 ,",
    "then all our variables are given uniquely in terms of the basic plasma parameters . by using the expressions for @xmath115 and @xmath125 we may solve for @xmath49 .",
    "the result is @xmath126 [ using @xmath127 from eq.([movf1 ] ) ] .",
    "a plot of @xmath49 versus wavenumber is given in fig.[mov3 ] for each branch @xmath128 .",
    "versus normalized pump wavenumber @xmath117 due to the normalization condition ( [ movbnorm ] ) , with @xmath118 and @xmath95 .",
    "the solid curve is for the upper branch of the dispersion relation , the dashed curve is for the lower branch of the dispersion relation.,width=377 ]    it is important to note that @xmath129 as @xmath120 for the upper branch .",
    "it follows that all the velocity amplitudes are well behaved near @xmath130",
    ".    the remaining pump quantities to solve for are the charge ratios @xmath131 .",
    "these may be obtained by imposing the charge neutrality condition on both the background plasma and on the perturbations to the equilibrium .",
    "this is justified since we are interested only with frequencies that are much less than that of the electron plasma frequency .",
    "this means the electrons have sufficient time to respond to the perturbations from the equilibrium and neutralize the plasma at each point in space .",
    "thus , on the perturbed plasma we impose the condition , @xmath132 where we have ignored the effects of dust ( or ion ) charging , that is , @xmath4 is constant .",
    "it is then straightforward to obtain the charge ratios in terms of the densities , and subsequently in terms of the velocity amplitudes and @xmath49 , as follows : @xmath133 this implies that the amount of charge that resides on each species is temporally coupled to the other .",
    "using the derived set of quantities characterizing the pump wave we may , in principle , investigate the possibility of excited modes propagating at arbitrary angles with respect to the @xmath44-axis , as in ref.@xcite .",
    "however , by removing the @xmath55-dependence in the pump waves our calculations become much more tractable , with the requirement that our excited waves are restricted to _ parallel _",
    "propagation along the @xmath44-axis , see ref.@xcite .    for an infinitely extended medium ,",
    "the perpendicular wavenumber of the excited waves is then zero .",
    "however , this would clearly be inconsistent with wavenumber matching of a propagating pump with finite perpendicular wavenumber .",
    "we therefore envisage this analysis to apply to a standing wave ( in the transverse direction ) pump in a finite geometry system , such as a cylindrical or toroidal laboratory plasma , or an astrophysical magnetic flux tube ; by seeking localized solutions for distances transverse to the magnetic field such that @xmath134 in a planar plasma , or @xmath135 in a cylindrical plasma , we can recover the initially proposed form for the magnetic field eq.([movinitb ] ) . in other words",
    ", we are taking @xmath55 small rather than @xmath136 small , to ensure that the fields will look approximately uniform in the perpendicular direction , i.e.  that the wavelength is effectively very long on the length scale of interest . in the parallel direction , however , the pump fields are uniform , we place no such restriction on distances and excited wavelengths , and we can apply wavenumber matching of the excited wave fields in that direction , as discussed in section vi .",
    "then in the region near the @xmath44-axis we have @xmath137_{k_{0}x\\sim\\bar{\\varepsilon}}{&\\!\\!}={&\\!\\!}b_{0 } ( 1+\\bar{\\varepsilon}b\\cos(\\omega_{0}t ) ) \\hat{\\bf z},\\label{movmag2}\\\\ \\left[{\\bf v}_{1}^{(0)}\\right]_{k_{0}x\\sim{\\bar{\\varepsilon}}}{&\\!\\!}={&\\!\\!}{\\bf 0 } , \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\",

    "since the magnetic field has now simply a periodic variation in time it resembles a canonical parametric pump .",
    "the problem then resembles a parametric amplifier , such as a harmonic oscillator with a time - varying spring constant . for use in the excited wave equations we must also compute the derivatives near the @xmath44-axis , given here : @xmath139_{k_{0}x\\sim\\bar{\\varepsilon}}{&\\!\\!}={&\\!\\!}{\\bf",

    "next we wish to test the stability of the self consistent linear solution given in eqs.([movmag2])([movrhoderiv ] ) , now regarded as a finite - amplitude pump wave , to the excitation of waves propagating along the magnetic field direction . we must however be careful since this is only a linearized pump solution . to proceed",
    "we will adopt the basic methodology of refs.@xcite , but shall attempt to refine the argument .    the basic technique is to perturb each quantity , i.e. , @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 , by an arbitrarily small amount as measured by an expansion parameter @xmath144 .",
    "for example , take an arbitrary field , say @xmath97 , with a known linear representation of the pump field : @xmath145 .",
    "then refs.@xcite proceed by perturbing this quantity in the following way : @xmath146 however , since @xmath147 has neglected terms of @xmath148 , the term of @xmath149 is even more so negligible in this expansion ( recall that @xmath144 is arbitrarily small ) .",
    "the problem lies in the fact that we are ultimately interested in the stability of the _ exact _ pump solution , say @xmath150 , with @xmath151 thus , we shall perform the following expansion instead : @xmath152 upon substitution into our set of nonlinear differential equations ( [ movcont])([moveuld ] ) , we obtain a set of equations of the following structure ( no approximations ) : @xmath153 where @xmath154 are differential operators acting on their respective arguments which we may treat as functions ( for brevity we have suppressed their dependence on fields other than @xmath97 ) .",
    "now @xmath155 by definition of an exact pump solution .",
    "also , the term of @xmath156 can certainly be neglected .",
    "next , we taylor expand @xmath157 and write @xmath158 we are then permitted to neglect this term of @xmath159 when inserted back into eq.([movabcd ] ) .",
    "this gives us a set of equations for the perturbation @xmath160 , in terms of the @xmath161 , to sufficient accuracy , i.e. , @xmath162 note that @xmath161 has served two purposes .",
    "first , it gives us an approximate description of the corresponding exact solution @xmath163 , and second , it allows us to investigate its stability without ever having to find @xmath164 .",
    "our task then is to ascertain the primed variables which are the excited fields . as stated previously , we are interested only in plane waves that travel parallel to the @xmath44-axis . in this case",
    ", any longitudinal components will decouple completely and merely describe a linear acoustic wave , so we may set the @xmath44-component of the primed velocity to zero .",

    "these types of modifications will occur near each natural frequency ; see fig.5(b ) for a simplified representation of this effect .",
    "in fact an exact solution would be more complicated with the identification of harmonics etc , but this figure should illuminate the key feature of the interaction .",
    "this is described as a _",
    "parametric interaction _ between the excited fields due to the pump fields .",
    "in order to proceed we consider the case in which the interaction is greatest , as in refs.@xcite .",
    "it is clear that this effect will be greatest when the right hand side of eq.([movfourdisp ] ) is large , which is the resonance condition .",
    "this occurs when one of the fourier transforms on the right hand side is resonant , in other words when their arguments are near one of the @xmath194 s , as conveyed in fig.[mov5 ] .",
    "since the right hand side of eq.([movfourdisp ] ) involves terms of the form : @xmath223 and @xmath224 , it follows that there will be a large parametric interaction when @xmath192 _ or _",
    "@xmath191 satisfies this .",
    "now , as mentioned earlier we are restricting our attention to positive @xmath40 ( without loss of generality ) . under this condition",

    "suppose the secondary species is negatively charged and @xmath225 ( i.e. , @xmath226 ) .",

    "that is , the resonance condition describes the coupling of a pump wave with two daughter waves .",
    "moreover , if @xmath231 then we can have @xmath232 , @xmath233 or @xmath234 and the same conditions for resonance apply .",
    "similar rules apply for @xmath235 and for a plasma where the secondary species is positive .",
    "let us now address the issue of the treatment of the wavenumber @xmath177 in our pair of interacting waves .",
    "first , note that in the @xmath44-direction the _ pump _ wavenumber @xmath136 is zero .",
    "for the natural modes we have that a wave given by @xmath236 is physically equivalent to a wave given by @xmath237 .",
    "thus our two interacting waves will be given by @xmath238 and @xmath239 , where @xmath240 are any combination of @xmath241 .",
    "hence the wavenumbers associated with each interacting wave are equal and opposite , i.e. , @xmath242 which is a statement of conservation of momentum in the @xmath44-direction .",
    "the fact that the right hand side is zero reflects the spatial uniformity of the pump wave .",
    "this tells us that if the approximately spatially uniform standing pump wave decays , then it does so into two daughter waves of equal wavelength travelling in opposite directions .",
    "since the wavenumber magnitudes are equal we may just consider the wavenumber @xmath177 without referring to the sense of polarization .",
    "this is a direct generalization of the previous investigations in @xcite .    with the above framework",
    "we now proceed to solve for @xmath74 from the fourier transform relationship .",
    "we discuss the method involved in obtaining @xmath74 in the case where a left handed wave interacts with a right handed wave , denoted @xmath243 . here we may assume , without loss of generality , that @xmath244 in eq.([movcorrection ] ) , where @xmath245 is any one of @xmath246 .",
    "this will interact with @xmath247 ( i.e. , @xmath248 may be any one of @xmath249 ) .",
    "following the methodology of ref.@xcite we form another equation corresponding to ( [ movfourdisp ] ) under the transformation @xmath250 . in the resulting two equations ,",
    "we neglect the obviously nonresonant terms @xmath223 and @xmath251",
    ". additionally , due to our particular choice of interaction , i.e. , left - right , we neglect @xmath252 and @xmath253 , and retain only @xmath254 and @xmath255 .",

    ", it is at this point that the conservation of energy and momentum rules are used to explicitly obtain @xmath261 .",
    "the procedure is to use @xmath198 to solve for @xmath262 in terms of @xmath177 .",
    "these solutions are then added together and equated to @xmath47 .",
    "the resultant expression is then solved for @xmath177 and subsequently substituted into the expressions for @xmath262 .",
    "this process explicitly shows that the resonance condition , for a given value of pump frequency @xmath47 , uniquely determines the frequencies and wavenumbers of the excited waves .",
    "now , this is all possible since the solution of @xmath198 in the one species limit is merely a quadratic , see eq.([movquad ] ) .",
    "however , in our case we must solve a cubic .",
    "as such , the resulting expressions for @xmath261 are too complicated to be reproduced here .",
    "let us just note that it is still true that @xmath47 determines them uniquely .    in order to solve for @xmath243 in eq.([movmaindisp ] ) we taylor expand @xmath263 around @xmath264 to order @xmath48 , then use the fact that @xmath265 , to obtain @xmath266 where @xmath267 while @xmath268 can be treated similarly .",

    "@xmath271 ) with the modification that @xmath272 is of the opposite sign .",
    "this technique may also be applied to both the left - left interactions and the right - right interactions .",
    "this includes the possibility of a slow wave interacting with a fast wave ( e.g. , @xmath205 and @xmath206 ) , and waves of equal frequency interacting .",
    "these sorts of interactions occur only because of the velocity derivative terms in ( [ movvelderiv ] ) & ( [ movvelderiv2 ] ) . in obtaining @xmath74",
    "we must retain and neglect the appropriate selection of fourier transforms according to the choice made .",
    "here we introduce @xmath273 and @xmath274 as two ( possible equal ) left hand modes , and @xmath275 and @xmath276 as two ( possible equal ) right hand modes .",

    "it is worth noting that in other types of parametric problems , such as modulational and beam instabilities , a graphical approach is useful in classifying the instabilities ; they occur where two normal mode lines cross and reconnect @xcite . in those cases",
    "the number of interacting modes is finite , and the nonlinear dispersion relation can be obtained in closed form . in our case , however , we can not obtain the nonlinear dispersion relation in closed form , due to the infinite number of interacting modes ; the decay interaction of the two excited modes with the pump is postulated in the first approximation , and the classification of the instability is relatively straightforward .",
    "from the expressions for @xmath278 it is easy to see that these quantities are real valued when we are in a frequency - wavenumber regime such that a pump wave can propagate .",
    "hence @xmath74 is either purely real or purely imaginary . if @xmath74 is real then what we have found is a correction to the natural mode frequency which adds an extra fourier component to the field expansions .",
    "if @xmath74 is imaginary then the daughter waves will either undergo exponential growth or decay .",
    "moreover , since there will exist both a positive and a negative imaginary frequency solution and since the frequency is conserved , this implies that one of the daughter waves will grow and the other will decay . in such cases",
    "the presence of one exponentially growing daughter wave implies that anywhere in which @xmath279 is a region of instability . in this case",

    "two out of each of these three are the modified fast and slow ( ion - cyclotron ) modes .",
    "there were three basic types of interactions allowed ; left - right , left - left and right - right , each of which has several combinations dependent on both the choice of branch from the pump wave ( upper and lower ) and the choice of natural mode ( slow and fast ) , giving rise to twelve interactions in total for any particular plasma .",
    "we derived the frequency changes to the natural modes , corresponding to growth rates when the perturbation to the frequency was imaginary .",
    "we can summarize the main features of the instabilities for the left ",
    "right interactions ( opposite sense circular polarization ) as follows :    \\(i ) of the four combinations allowed , three are unstable when the number density of the second massive species is substantial , and all four are unstable when the number density of the second massive species is low .",
    "\\(i ) these interactions involve six and two combinations respectively when the second species is positive , and the reverse when the second species is negative .",
    "this follows simply from the assortment of handedness of natural modes .",
    "\\(ii ) of these only the @xmath310 interaction is stable , while the others display interesting behaviors . in particular , in the positive case , the @xmath306 curve approaches @xmath322 as @xmath323 where the excited wavenumber @xmath177 experiences a resonance , while its growth rate is maximal at @xmath52 just below @xmath324 in the negative case .",
    "\\(iii ) in contrast to the left ",
    "right interactions , the upper pump mode can give the strongest instabilities .",
    "the @xmath309 interaction has a large growth rate between @xmath325 and @xmath326 in the positive second species case , and at higher values of pump frequency in the negative second species case .    in several of the above interactions the growth rate starts at a nonzero value",
    "this occurs in the cases where the starting value of @xmath52 have a corresponding nonzero value for @xmath136 , so the velocity derivative terms are nonzero .",
    "a possibility for further work would be to allow the excited waves to be fully oblique , rather than simply parallel to the background magnetic field .",
    "in doing so we would be able to remove the long pump wavelength assumption , which may lead to interesting features . in the single ion case",
    "this was treated in ref.@xcite , albeit without pressure .",
    "it is anticipated that implementation of the accompanying additional wavenumber matching rules , in both the @xmath44 and @xmath55 directions , would be algebraically complicated .",
