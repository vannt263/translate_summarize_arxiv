    "the observational features in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and x - ray binaries can be successfully explained by the standard geometrically thin , optically thick accretion disc model ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "the motion of the matter in the standard thin model of the accretion disc is approximately keplerian , and the energy released in the accreting gas is radiated away locally . in the past two decades , another type of accretion flow has been considered that the energy released due to heating processes in the flow may be trapped within accreting gas . as , only the small fraction of the energy released in the accretion flow is radiated away due to inefficient cooling , and most of the energy",
    "is stored in the accretion flow and advected to the central object .",
    "this type of accretion flow is called as advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) .",

    "they suggested accretion in such systems are under weakly collisional condition .",
    "moreover , they suggested thermal conduction as a possible mechanism by which the sufficient extra heating is provided in hot accretion flows . in following ,",
    "johnson & quataert ( 2007 ) studied the effects of electron thermal conduction on the properties of a spherical hot accretion flows .",
    "their model is applicable for sgr a@xmath0 in the galactic centre . because , electron heat conduction is important for low accretion rate systems .",
    "they also found a supervirial temperature in the presence of thermal conduction .",

    "since the observational evidences and magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) simulations have expressed the toroidal magnetic field and the magnetic diffusivity are important in accretion flows ( see faghei 2011a and references therein ) , faghei ( 2011a ) examined the self - similar solutions of viscous and resistive adafs in the presence of a toroidal magnetic field .",
    "but , he did not consider the effects of thermal conduction in his model . while , the recent studies of resistive accretion flows have represented that thermal conduction can play an importance role in such systems ( e.g. sharma et al .",
    "2008 ; ghanbari et al .",
    "sharma et al . ( 2008 ) studied the effects of thermal conduction on magnetized spherical accretion flows using global axisymmetric mhd simulations . in their model , when the magnetic energy density becomes comparable to the gravitational potential energy density , the plasma due to resistivity is heated to roughly the virial temperature , the mean inflow becomes highly subsonic , and most of the energy released by accretion is transported to large radii by thermal conduction and the accretion rate became much smaller than bondi accretion rate .",
    "moreover , they found that for a larger values of conductive parameter , energy transport through thermal conduction becomes the dominant energy transport mechanism at small radii .",

    "they studied induction equation of magnetic field in a steady state that is not according to anti - dynamo theorem ( e.g. cowling 1981 ) and is useful only in particular systems where the magnetic dissipation time is much longer than the age of the system . on the other hand",
    ", this assumption implies that the flow is in balance between escape and creation of the magnetic field .    in this paper",
    ", we adopt the presented solutions by tanaka & menou ( 2006 ) and faghei ( 2011a ) .",
    "thus , we will investigate the influences of thermal conduction on a viscous and resistive adaf in the presence of a toroidal magnetic field .",
    "moreover , it is assumed that magnetic diffusivity in the present model is not constant , and escaping and creating of magnetic field are unbalanced . from some aspects",

    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the basic equations of constructing a model for quasi - spherical magnetized advection dominated accretion flow with thermal conduction will be defined . in section 3 ,",
    "self- similar method for solving equations which govern the behaviour of the accreting gas was utilized .",
    "the summary of the model will appear in section 4 .",
    "we suppose a rotating and accreting gas around a schwarzschild black hole of mass @xmath2 . the flow is assumed to be in advection dominated stage , where viscous and resistive heating are balanced by the advection cooling and thermal conduction .",
    "we use a spherical coordinate ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) centred on the accreting object .",
    "furthermore , the flow is assumed to be steady and axisymmetric ( @xmath6 ) , and the equations will be considered in the equatorial plane , @xmath7 .",
    "thus , all flow variables are a function of only @xmath3 . for the sake of simplicity , the general relativistic effects are ignored and newtonian gravity is used .",
    "the magnetic field in the present model has only a toroidal component . under assumptions ,",
    "the model is described by the following equations :    the continuity equation with mass loss is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is density , @xmath10 is the radial infall velocity , and @xmath11 the mass - loss rate per unit volume .",
    "the radial equation of momentum is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the angular velocity of the flow , @xmath14 is the keplerian angular velocity , @xmath15 the isothermal sound speed , which is defined as @xmath16 , @xmath17 being the gas pressure , and @xmath18 is alfven speed , which is defined as @xmath19 , @xmath20 being the magnetic pressure .",
    "the angular momentum transfer equation is @xmath21,\\ ] ] where the right - hand side of above equation describes the effects of viscous torques due to shear ( @xmath22 , here , is kinematic coefficient of viscosity ) . as noted in the introduction , we assume both of the kinematic coefficient of viscosity and the magnetic diffusivity due to turbulence in the accretion flow .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to use these parameters in analogy to the @xmath1-prescription of shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) for the turbulent , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the magnetic prandtl number , which is assumed a constant of order of unity , @xmath25 is the magnetic diffusivity , and @xmath1 is a free parameter less than unity .    the energy equation becomes @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the dissipation rate by viscosity @xmath28 and resistivity @xmath29 , @xmath30 represents the energy loss through radiative cooling , and @xmath31 is the energy transported by thermal conduction . for the right - hand side of the energy equation , we can write @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the advective transport of energy .",
    "we exploit the advection factor , @xmath34 , that describes the fraction of the dissipation energy which is stored in the accretion flow and advected into the central object rather than being radiated away . in general , the advection factor depends on the details of the heating and radiative cooling mechanisms and will vary by position ( e.g. watari 2006 , 2007 ; sinha et al .",
    "2009 ) . here",
    ", we assume a constant @xmath35 for simplicity .",
    "clearly , the flow in the case of @xmath36 is in the extreme limit of no radiative cooling and in the limit of efficient radiative cooling , we have @xmath37 .    as mentioned , the inner regions of hot accretion flows are collisionless and the electron mean free path due to coulomb collision is larger than the radius .",
    "this property is described as _",
    "( cowie & mckee 1977 ) . the traditional equation of heat flux due to thermal conduction ,",
    "@xmath38 which @xmath39 being the thermal conduction coefficient , is not valid for such systems . because this equation is suitable for the collisional plasma ,",
    "in which mean free path of electron energy exchange is smaller than temperature scale height .",
    "cowie & mckee ( 1977 ) derived the heat flux for the collisionless plasma as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a factor is less than unity and is called as saturation constant .",
    "now , the viscous and resistive heating rates and the energy transport by thermal conduction are expressed as @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the current density , @xmath46 being the magnetic field .",
    "we used a minus sign in equation ( 10 ) . because we want thermal conduction as energy transport mechanism outward . on the other hand",
    ", heat conduction flux will be behaved like a cooling mechanism in accretion flow . finally ,",
    "since we consider only the toroidal field , the induction equation with field escape can be written as @xmath47=\\dot{b}_{\\varphi}.\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the toroidal component of magnetic field and @xmath49 is the field escaping / creating rate due to a magnetic instability or dynamo effect .",

    "thus , this parameter will be constant throughout the disc . while , khesali & faghei ( 2008 , 2009 ) showed that it varies by position .",
    "in hot accretion flows , typical value of @xmath51 is in the range @xmath53-@xmath54 ( e.g. de villiers et al .",
    "2003 ; beckwith et al .",
    "2008 ) . here",
    ", we will also consider the magnetically dominated case ( @xmath55 ) . because , when thermal instability happens in an adaf , the mhd numerical simulations imply that the thermal pressure rapidly decreases while the magnetic pressure increases due to the conservation of magnetic flux ( machida et al .",
    "this will result in large @xmath51 and forms a magnetically dominated accretion flow ( bu et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the self - similar method is useful to understand of the physics of accretion flows .",
    "this method is familiar due to its wide range of applications in many research fields of astrophysics .",
    "self - similar solution , although constituting only a limited part of problem , is often useful to understand the basic behaviour of the system .",
