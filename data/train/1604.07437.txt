    "the treatment of convection in stellar envelopes is one of the largest sources of uncertainty in the interior modeling of late - type stars .",
    "convection in stellar models is usually described by the mixing length theory ( mlt ; bhm - vitense 1958 ) , which represents convection with a single characteristic length that is proportional to the local pressure scale height @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a free parameter .",
    "there are other 1d formulations ( e.g. , arnett et al .",
    "2010 ) , but these are not devoid of free parameters either .",
    "mlt and other formulations define the thermal stratification of the convective envelope , which is essentially adiabatic , and the primary weakness affecting these formulations is that the existence of the freely adjustable scale factors , like @xmath3 , permits a wide range of adiabatic structures .",
    "the mixing length parameter is usually held at a constant value for stars at all phases of evolution . most frequently , this value is the one needed to model the sun such that it has the correct radius and luminosity at the solar age .",
    "an issue with the mixing length parameter is that it is not unique , even for calibrated solar models .",
    "while calibrated models all have the correct radius , even with chemical composition constrained , the value of @xmath3 depends on the atmospheric model ( the @xmath4-@xmath5 relation ) used , the equation of state , and also on whether or not diffusion and gravitational settling of helium and heavy elements are included in the models .",
    "clearly , @xmath3 alone does not contain intrinsic information about convective dynamics , and a value that is suitable for one model may not be appropriate for another .",
    "the mixing length parameter determines the radius of a stellar model , and hence predictions of stellar radii can be incorrect .",
    "additionally , since the parameter is usually held constant in stellar model calculations , the dependence of convection on the properties of stars , such as surface gravity , effective temperature and metallicity are eliminated .",
    "this is the case despite the fact that data suggest that the mixing length parameter should depend on stellar properties such as metallicity ( e.g. bonaca et al . 2012 ) and other properties ( yildiz 2006 ; lebreton et al .",
    ". the limitations of the mixing length approximation have led to studies of stellar convection using three - dimensional radiative hydrodynamic ( 3d rhd ) simulations .",
    "simulations have been applied to dwarf stars ( e.g. , ramrez et al .",
    "2009 ) , giants ( e.g. , ludwig & kucinskas 2012 ) , and several targeted studies of individual stars ( e.g. , robinson et al . 2004 , 2005 ;",

    "2006 , 2007 ; ludwig et al . 2009 ; behara et al .",
    "2010 ) .",

    "the current focus of research in the community is to determine how the properties of convection from 3d simulations can be applied to 1d models of stars .",
    "for example , one of the properties that can be extracted from 3d simulations of convection is the @xmath4-@xmath5 relation , which can be used as the outer boundary condition of 1d stellar models .",
    "tanner et al . ( 2014 ) have shown that the @xmath4-@xmath5 relation depends on the properties of a star and is generally quite different from the approximate models , such as the eddington @xmath4-@xmath5 approximation ( see e.g. mihalas 1978 ) , or even semi - empirical ones , such as the krishna swamy relation ( 1966 ) or the val models ( vernazza et al . 1981 ) .",
    "trampedach et al .",
    "( 2014 ) have made available a suite of @xmath4-@xmath5 relations derived from 3d simulations , and codes to use them easily .",
    "the second , crucial , parameter that is the focus of research is the mixing length parameter itself .",
    "the idea of determining an effective mixing length parameter from simulations of convection is not new .",
    "early efforts to derive a relationship between @xmath3 and stellar parameters include the use of 2d simulations by ludwig et al .",
    "( 1999 ) to map out the envelope specific entropy in the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane , and translate it into a mixing length parameter .",
    "however , this was not widely adopted .",
    "more recently , trampedach et al .",
    "( 2014 ) calibrated the mixing length parameter by matching averages of 3d simulations to 1d stellar envelope models .",
    "they found that this led to @xmath3 varying from 1.6 for the warmest dwarf , which is just cool enough to have a convective envelope , and up to 2.05 for the coolest dwarf in their grid .",
    "magic et al .",
    "( 2015 ) used a different approach and used the entropy profiles to determine values of the mixing length , from this they provide a functional form for the mixing length that depends on , , and metallicity .    in this letter , we use the simulations from tanner et al .",

    "( 2013 ) to show that the entropy in the adiabatic regions of 3d simulations can be expressed more conveniently in a single - valued functional form when projected on a rotated -  plane .",
    "the method proposed in this letter builds upon the pioneering work of others , but offers a few advantages .",
    "first , a single - valued functional form is convenient from a modelling perspective .",
    "for example , in stellar evolution codes , the desired stellar model entropy can be evaluated as the model evolves without the need for multidimensional interpolation in the -  plane .",
    "second , and more importantly , calibrating against thermodynamic quantities is not dependent on particular modelling codes . in the absence of an improved model that accurately describes convective dynamics in stars , the most direct route to improving stellar models through calibration may be to leverage existing parameterized convection models such as mlt .",
    "while thermodynamic quantities ( in this case the entropy adiabat , ) can always be related to parameters like the mixing length , the translation renders the calibration model - dependent .",
    "this is indeed useful if one wishes to calibrate models with a particular stellar evolution code , but it can not be applied generally since the interpretation of parameters such as @xmath3 is specific to the model . instead , we choose to look at how fundamental physical quantities , such as the specific entropy , vary in the -plane .",
    "one of the major weakness affecting models constructed using the mlt is the freely adjustable scale factor @xmath3 , which permits a wide range of adiabatic structures . this , and three other free parameters ( see e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the mlt formalism to account for geometric properties of convection , set the entropy profile below the photosphere , and determine the asymptotic limit of the entropy ( or ) that is reached when convection is efficient , and the stratification is very near to adiabatic .",
    "this is in turn reflected in a large uncertainty in the calculated radii .    with mlt models alone",
    ", there is no way to determine which asymptotic entropy , or adiabat , is correct . to illustrate this , in figure  [ fig : mlt ]",
    "we show the specific entropy profiles of four 1d stellar models with identical stellar atmosphere parameters , each computed with a different value of @xmath3 .",
    "the specific entropy in both 1d models and 3d simulations was calculated with the opal @xcite equation of state tables . near the surface",
    "there exists a steep entropy gradient where radiative transfer of energy dominates , and the stratification is convectively stable . further down , the entropy reaches a minimum and the entropy gradient switches sign , indicating that the region is convectively unstable .",
    "the entropy gradient continues to flatten with depth , with the entropy approaching a near - constant value that depends on @xmath3 , and remains roughly constant throughout the convective region until the effect of overshoot near the interior edge of the convective envelope changes the profile again .",
    "one advantage of 3d simulations over 1d models is that simulations do not have an arbitrarily set mixing length parameter , and instead converge to a thermal structure that self - consistently links the deep adiabatic layers to the radiative atmosphere .",
    "also shown in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : mlt ] is the mean entropy profile for a 3d simulation with the same  and  as the 1d models .",
    "there are no free parameters ( beyond factors for artificial viscosity and the subgrid scale model ) , so the resulting entropy profile is unique to the surface gravity , effective temperature and chemical composition of the simulation . comparing the simulated entropy profile to the mlt models , we see that there is a value of @xmath3 that can reproduce the simulated",
    ". however , the complete entropy profile in the simulation can not be matched by any of the mlt models , and this can be for a number of reasons , such as the use of an inconsistent @xmath4-@xmath5 relation or more likely , the absence of dynamical effects in the 1d models .",
    "we shall concentrate only on in our approach to mixing length calibration .",
    "this is similar to the recent work of magic et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , where the entropy adiabat is related to the mixing length parameter ; what we show here , is that the evolution of  could potentially be described as a function of a single variable , which would be simpler to implement in 1d stellar evolution codes .",
    "in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : mlt ] , we show contours of constant  as obtained from 3d simulations by magic et al .",
    "( 2015 ) plotted on the -  plane .",
    "also shown on the plot for reference are evolutionary tracks ( computed with the grevesse and sauval ( 1998 ) mixture and metallicity @xmath6 ) , which are included to show the region of main - sequence stellar evolution .",
    "one striking feature of the  contours is that they are nearly parallel , and for a particular chemical composition ,  appears to be a smooth function of  and .",
    "the smoothly - varying nature of the  contours leads us to believe that a simple projection of the -  plane may sufficient to exploit the fundamental relationship between , , and .",
    "we show that this is indeed possible in figure  [ fig : rotate ] , where simulations performed independently by tanner et al .",
    "( 2013a , b ; 2014 ) and magic et al .",
    "( 2013 ) are presented on different projections of the -  plane .",
    "these simulations were performed with different codes and with different radiative transfer schemes , and while the simulations had similar equations of state and metallicities , they differed in their atmospheric structures : the tanner et al .",
    "simulations assume gray atmospheres while magic et al .",
    "do not . for all these simulations , the envelope entropy , ,",
    "can be projected on to a one - dimensional curve when plotted against a linear combination of  and ( i.e. the -plane becomes @xmath7 ) .    in this work , the precise values of the constants @xmath8 and @xmath9 for each metallicity",
    "were selected with a non - linear least squares minimization to a pre - determined function .",
    "first , a function of the form @xmath10 was selected by visual inspection to represent the dimensionally - reduced dataset .",
    "the choice of function is arbitrary , but the authors note that the resulting parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 are not particularly sensitive to this , provided that the function can adequately reproduce the variation of .",
    "this function function comprises six parameters that define the relationship of  across the -  plane , and the least - squares minimization algorithm of @xcite was then used to determine their values ( listed in table [ table : params ] ) .",
    "the process is repeated for different convective envelope compositions ( see figure  [ fig : metal ] ) , each of which require a unique projection of the -  plane .",
    "this fitting process effectively reduces the dimensionality of the initial variation of  by projecting the -   plane onto an axis that is aligned with the convective envelope adiabats .",
    "the process used in this work is only one possible method for reducing the dimensionality of the problem , and further study using other statistical tools , such as principle components analysis , may yield additional insights into the fundamental relationship between convection zone entropy and the stellar surface parameters .",
    ".parameters for the function fit to  from magic _",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     since the convection zone adiabatic entropy value in a stellar model is determined by the mixing length parameter , the curves in figure  [ fig : metal ] basically show how we need to change @xmath3 as a function of  and . of course , the first step would be to determine which numerical value of @xmath3 yields a particular given the rest of the physics to set the mixing length scale , and thus determine how  changes with @xmath3 . after setting the relationship between  and @xmath3 , all that is required",
    "is to follow this relationship ( i.e. the curve in figure  [ fig : metal ] ) as the star evolves .",
    "since each time step in a stellar evolution calculation changes  and we will need to keep changing @xmath3 as we evolve a model .",
    "the two panels of figure  [ fig : entropycal ] outline in principle the steps that must be taken to translate the adiabatic specific entropy derived from a 3d simulation into the corresponding entropy calibrated value of @xmath3 to be used in the 1d mlt stellar model .",
    "figure  [ fig : entropycal](left ) shows , in the same entropy calibration plane as figure  [ fig : metal ] , the locus of a set of 3d simulations , all with the same chemical composition , but with different values of   in the deep part .",
    "also in the left panel , are three 1d mlt models , all with the same metallicity and surface conditions as the 3d simulations . presented relative to the projected and coordinates in this way",
    ", the evolution tracks begin on the zero - age main sequence with a relatively low , which increases as the model approaches the terminal age . for the purpose of demonstrating our calibration method , we will focus only on the main - sequence phase of the evolution tracks . because in the 1d mlt models , for a given composition , we have @xmath11 , all three models were chosen , for the sake of clarity in plotting , to share the same values of @xmath0 and @xmath12 , and to differ from each other only in the assumed @xmath3 .    in order to have  in 1d models",
    "match that of 3d simulations , the mlt parameter @xmath3 must be selected ( and varied with evolution ) so that the evolution track matches the locus of the 3d simulations . to illustrate this",
    ", we will consider a particular and  represented by the vertical dashed line in the left panel of the figure .",
    "the three example main - sequence mlt models ( identified on each evolution track with circles ) do not match the predicted by 3d simulations , but it is clear that a value for @xmath3 could be selected to reproduce the 3d simulated in the 1d mlt model .",
    "the intersection of the vertical line with the locus of the 3d simulations thus yields the correct entropy calibrated value of for the model with this particular and .",
    "the corresponding value of @xmath3 that will result in the desired can then be read off the plot on the right hand panel of figure  [ fig : entropycal ] .    as we emphasized earlier",
    ", a mapping between the entropy calibrated @xmath3 and  will not be general .",
    "it depends sensitively on various aspects of the stellar surface conditions , some of which are imperfectly understood , and are treated differently by various researchers .",
    "the specific calibrated value of @xmath3 is thus model dependent , as it depends on the details of the inputs used in the stellar evolution calculations .",
    "the calibration process described above can not be carried out once ( for each chemical composition ) to determine a value of @xmath3 that can applied to all other stellar models . instead ,",
    "the procedure illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : entropycal ] would need to be applied as part of the stellar evolution calculation .",
    "the calibration is also particularly sensitive to the details of the @xmath4-@xmath5 relation .",
    "this effect is well - known in solar model construction , where , for example a larger value of @xmath3 is needed to match the solar radius using a krishna - swamy model atmosphere than an eddington approximation model atmosphere .",
    "this is an important distinction between previous attempts at mixing - length calibration , and the technique we present in this letter . for the calibration to remain generally applicable to stellar models",
    ", it must relate to the thermal structure of the convective envelope , and for the purpose of improving the accuracy of stellar radii , calibrating against  is appropriate .",
    "our method shows that the evolution of  in the  -  plane can be presented in a convenient functional form , and we leave the final step of mapping from  to @xmath3 to the modeller .",
    "we have provided a simple prescription of how 3d simulations can be used to calibrate the mixing length parameter in 1d stellar models .",
    "the calibration procedure based on the specific entropy adiabat presented in this paper provides a reliable way , based on simple and well established physical principles , of evaluating theoretically stellar radii of late - type stars . in this respect ,",
    "the method is very general , since it depends only on the chemical composition and the well understood thermodynamic properties of deep convective stellar envelopes ."
