    "the field of @xmath8-ray pulsars has been revolutionized by the launch of the _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ; @xcite ) . over the past eight years",
    ", _ fermi _ has detected over 200 @xmath8-ray pulsars and has furthermore measured their light curves and spectral characteristics in unprecedented detail . _",
    "second pulsar catalog ( 2pc ; @xcite ) describes the properties of some 117 of these pulsars in the energy range 100  mev@xmath9100  gev .",
    "this catalog includes the vela pulsar @xcite , one of the brightest persistent sources in the gev sky .",
    "recently , _ h.e.s.s . _ detected pulsed emission from the vela pulsar in the 20@xmath9120  gev range ( a. abramowski et al .",
    "2016 , in preparation ) .",
    "this followed the detection of the crab pulsar by _ veritas _ and _ magic _ in the very - high - energy ( @xmath10100  gev ) regime ( and now possibly up to 1  tev ; @xcite ) . in this paper , we will focus on the gev band light curves of the vela pulsar .    despite the major advances made after nearly 50 years since the discovery of the first pulsar @xcite ,",
    "many questions still remain regarding the electrodynamical character of the pulsar magnetosphere , including details of the particle acceleration and pair production , current closure , and radiation of a complex multi - wavelength spectrum .",
    "physical emission models such as the slot gap ( sg ; @xcite ) and outer gap ( og ; @xcite ) fall short of explaining these global magnetospheric characteristics .",
    "more recent developments include the global magnetospheric properties .",
    "one example is the force - free ( ff ) inside and dissipative outside ( fido ) model @xcite that assumes ff electrodynamical conditions ( infinite plasma conductivity , @xmath11 ) inside the light cylinder and dissipative conditions ( finite @xmath12 ) outside .",
    "the wind models of , e.g. , @xcite provide an alternative picture where dissipation takes place outside the light cylinder .",
    "although much progress has been made using the physical models , geometric light curve modeling still presents a crucial avenue for probing the pulsar magnetosphere in the context of traditional pulsar models , as these emission geometries may be used to constrain the pulsar geometry ( inclination angle @xmath6 and the observer viewing angle @xmath7 with respect to the spin axis @xmath13 ) , as well as the @xmath8-ray emission region s location and extent .",
    "this may provide vital insight into the boundary conditions and help constrain the accelerator geometry of next - generation full radiation models .",
    "geometric light curve modeling has been performed by , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite using standard pulsar emission geometries , including a two - pole caustic ( tpc , of which the sg is its physical representation ; @xcite ) , og , and pair - starved polar cap ( pc ) @xcite geometry .",
    "a notable conclusion from the 2pc was that the spectra and light curves of both the millisecond pulsar ( msp ) and young pulsar populations show remarkable similarities , pointing to a common radiation mechanism and emission geometry ( tied to the @xmath0-field structure ) .",
    "the assumed @xmath0-field structure is essential for predicting the light curves seen by the observer using geometric models , since photons are expected to be emitted tangentially to the local @xmath0-field lines in the corotating pulsar frame @xcite .",
    "even a small difference in the magnetospheric structure will therefore have an impact on the light curve predictions .",
    "for all of the above geometric models , the most commonly employed @xmath0-field has been the retarded vacuum dipole ( rvd ) solution first obtained by @xcite .",
    "however , other solutions also exist .",
    "one example is the static dipole ( non - rotating ) field , a special case of the rvd ( rotating ) field  @xcite .",
    "@xcite furthermore modeled high - energy ( he ) light curves in the context of og and tpc models using an ff @xmath0-field geometry ( assuming a plasma - filled magnetosphere ) , proposing a separatrix layer model close to the last open field line ( tangent to the light cylinder at radius @xmath14 where the corotation speed equals the speed of light @xmath15 , with @xmath16 the angular speed ) , which extends from the stellar surface up to and beyond the light cylinder . in addition , the annular gap model of @xcite , which assumes a static dipole field , has been successful in reproducing the main characteristics of the @xmath8-ray light curves of three msps",
    ". this model does not , however , attempt to replicate the non - zero phase offsets between the @xmath8-ray and radio profiles .    in this paper ,",
    "we investigate the impact of different magnetospheric structures ( i.e. , the static dipole and rvd ) on the predicted @xmath8-ray pulsar light curves .",
    "additionally , we incorporate an offset - pc dipole @xmath0-field solution @xcite into our geometric modeling code .",
    "this analytic heuristic model mimics deviations from the static dipole such as what occur in complex solutions , e.g. , dissipative ( e.g. , @xcite ) and ff ( e.g. , @xcite ) fields .",
    "these complex @xmath0-fields usually only have numerical solutions , which are limited by the resolution of the spatial grid .",
    "hence , it is simpler to investigate the main effects of these structures using analytical approximations such as the offset - pc dipole solution . in combination with the different @xmath0-field solutions mentioned above , we assume standard tpc and og emission geometries .",
    "_ geometric _ models assume constant emissivity @xmath17 in the rotational frame .",
    "we have also incorporated an sg @xmath3-field associated with the offset - pc dipole @xmath0-field ( making this latter case an _ emission _ model ) , which allows us to calculate the @xmath18 in the acceleration region in the corotating frame from first principles .",
    "we have only considered the tpc ( assuming uniform @xmath18 ) and sg ( assuming variable @xmath18 as modulated by the @xmath3-field ) models for the offset - pc dipole @xmath0-field , since we do not have @xmath3-field expressions available for the og model within the context of an offset - pc dipole @xmath0-field . the fact that we have an @xmath3-field solution enables us to solve the particle transport equation on each @xmath0-field line , yielding the particle energy ( lorentz factor @xmath19 ) as a function of position .",
    "we can then use this factor to test whether the particle reaches the curvature radiation reaction ( crr ) limit , i.e. , where acceleration balances curvature radiation losses .",
    "we have implemented a chi - squared ( @xmath20 ) method to search the multivariate solution space for optimal model parameters when we compare our predicted model light curves with _ fermi _ lat data for the vela pulsar . in this way , we are able to determine which @xmath0-field and geometric model combination yields the best light curve solution , how the different light curve predictions compare with each other , and which pulsar geometry ( @xmath6,@xmath7 ) is optimal  @xcite .    in section  [ sec : geometries ] we describe the geometric pulsar models and @xmath0-field structures we considered .",
    "section  [ sec : implementation ] details the implementation of an offset - pc dipole @xmath0-field in our code .",
    "we also discuss the implementation of the associated sg @xmath3-field and the matching of the low - altitude and high - altitude solutions using a matching parameter ( scaled radius ) @xmath21 .",
    "we briefly describe the implementation of a @xmath22 method in order to find the best - fit ( @xmath6,@xmath7 ) for the different model combinations . in section  [ sec : results ] , we present our solution of the transport equation for the offset - pc dipole @xmath0-field , as well as our light curve predictions and best - fit ( @xmath6,@xmath7 ) contours for the vela pulsar . in section  [ sec : investigate ] we investigate the effects of lowering the minimum photon energy as well as multiplying the @xmath3-field by a factor of 100 when constructing model light curves , before we compare , in section  [ sec : comparison_models ] , our results to previous multi - wavelength studies from other works .",
    "our conclusions follow in section  [ sec : conclusions ] . given the length of this paper , we summarize our main conclusions here :    1 .",
    "the sg @xmath3-field is relatively low .",
    "we thus find that the particle energy only becomes large enough to yield significant curvature radiation at large altitudes above the stellar surface , so that particles do not always attain the radiation - reaction limit .",
    "our overall optimal light curve fit is for the rvd field and og model ; for this @xmath0-field , the tpc model is statistically disfavored .",
    "3 .   for the static dipole field , neither og nor tpc model is significantly preferred .",
    "4 .   we found that a smaller pc offset is favored for the offset - pc dipole field when assuming constant emissivity , and a larger pc offset favored for variable emissivity , but not significantly so .",
    "when multiplying the sg @xmath3-field by a factor of 100 , we found improved light curve fits , with @xmath6 and @xmath7 being closer to best fits from independent studies , as well as crr at lower altitudes .",
    "the geometric tpc pulsar model was first introduced by @xcite . @xcite revived the physical sg model of @xcite , including general relativistic ( gr ) corrections , and argued that the sg model may be considered a physical representation of the tpc model .",
    "this gap geometry has a large radial extent , spanning from the neutron star ( ns ) surface along the last closed field line up to the light cylinder .",
    "the original definition stated that the maximum radial extent reached @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "this was later extended to @xmath24 for improved fits ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "typical transverse gap extents of @xmath25 of the pc angle have been used @xcite .",
    "the og model was introduced by @xcite and elaborated by @xcite .",
    "they proposed that when the primary current passes through the neutral sheet or null - charge surface ( ncs ; with a radius of @xmath26 , i.e. , the geometric surface across which the charge density changes sign ) the negative charges above this sheet will escape beyond the light cylinder .",
    "a vacuum gap region is then formed ( in which the @xmath3-field parallel to the local @xmath0-field , @xmath27 ) .",
    "analogously , the geometric og model has a radial extent spanning from the ncs to the light cylinder .",
    "we follow @xcite and @xcite who considered a one - layer model with a transverse extent along the inner edge of the gap .",
    "the @xmath0-field is one of the basic assumptions of the geometric models ( others include the gap region s location and the @xmath18 profile in the gap ) .",
    "several @xmath0-field structures have been studied in this context , including the static dipole @xcite , the rvd ( a rotating vacuum magnetosphere which can in principle accelerate particles but do not contain any charges or currents ; @xcite ) , the ff ( filled with charges and currents , but unable to accelerate particles , since the accelerating @xmath3-field is screened everywhere ; @xcite ) , and the offset - pc dipole ( which analytically mimics deviations from the static dipole near the stellar surface ; @xcite )",
    ". a more realistic pulsar magnetosphere , i.e. , a dissipative solution @xcite , would be one that is intermediate between the rvd and the ff fields .",
    "the dissipative @xmath0-field is characterized by the plasma conductivity @xmath12 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which can be chosen in order to alternate between the vacuum ( @xmath28 ) and ff ( @xmath11 ) cases ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we studied the effect of different magnetospheric structures ( static dipole , rvd , and offset - pc dipole , further discussed below ) and emission geometries ( tpc and og ) on pulsar visibility and @xmath8-ray pulse shape , particularly for the case of the vela pulsar .",
    "the solution for a @xmath0-field surrounding a rotating ns in vacuum was first derived by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . the general expression for this rvd field in the rotation frame ( where @xmath29 ) is given by @xmath30 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + { \\hat{{\\mathbf{r}}}}{\\hat{{\\mathbf { r}}}}{\\boldsymbol{\\cdot}}\\left[3\\frac{{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}(t)}{r^3}+3\\frac{\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}(t)}{cr^2}+\\frac{\\ddot{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}(t)}{c^2r}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the magnetic moment @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the first and second time derivatives of the magnetic moment , and ( @xmath34,@xmath35,@xmath36 ) are the cartesian unit vectors",
    ". see @xcite for the rvd solution in spherical or cartesian coordinates in the laboratory frame .",
    "in the limit of @xmath37 , the retarded field simplifies to the non - aligned static dipole @xmath0-field ( @xmath38 ) . for the static dipole the field lines are symmetric about the @xmath39-axis , whereas the rvd is distorted due to sweepback of the field lines as the ns rotates .",
    "this has implications for the definition of the pc ( see section  [ sub : code ] ) .",
    "the offset - pc dipole is a heuristic model of a non - dipolar magnetic structure where the pcs are offset from the @xmath40-axis .",
    "the @xmath0-field lines are therefore azimuthally asymmetric compared to those of a pure static dipole field .",
    "this leads to field lines having a smaller curvature radius @xmath41 over half of the pc ( in the direction of the pc offset ) compared to those of the other half .",
    "such small distortions in the @xmath0-field structure are due to retardation and asymmetric currents , thereby shifting the pcs by small amounts in different directions .    @xcite considered two cases , i.e. , symmetric and asymmetric pc offsets .",
    "the symmetric case involves an offset of both pcs in the same direction and applies to nss with some interior current distortions that produce multipolar components near the stellar surface .",
    "the asymmetric case is associated with asymmetric pc offsets in opposite directions and applies to pc offsets due to retardation and/or currents of the global magnetosphere .",
    "these non - dipolar @xmath0-field geometries are motivated by observations of thermal x - ray emission , e.g. , pulse profiles from msps such as psr j0437@xmath94715 @xcite and psr j0030 + 0451 @xcite , with the @xmath0-fields of nss in low - mass x - ray binaries being even more distorted @xcite .",
    "magnetic fields such as the ff solution ( characterized by different pc currents than those assumed in space - charge limited flow models ; @xcite ) will undergo larger sweepback of field lines near the light cylinder , and consequently display a larger offset of the pc toward the trailing side ( opposite to the rotation direction ) than in the rvd field ( which has offset pcs due to rotation alone ) . in what follows",
    ", we decided to study the effect of the simpler symmetric case ( which does not mimic field line sweepback of ff , rvd , or dissipative magnetospheres ) on predicted light curves . in the future",
    ", one can also include the more complex asymmetric case .",
    "the general expression for a symmetric offset - pc dipole @xmath0-field in spherical coordinates @xmath42 in the magnetic frame ( indicated by the primed coordinates , where @xmath43 ) is as follows @xcite @xmath44,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the magnetic moment , @xmath46 the stellar radius , @xmath47 the surface @xmath0-field strength at the magnetic pole , @xmath48 the magnetic azimuthal angle defining the plane in which the offset occurs , and @xmath49 characterizes the offset direction in the @xmath50 plane . if @xmath51 or @xmath52 the offset is in the @xmath53 direction ( i.e. , along the @xmath53-axis ) .",
    "if @xmath54 or @xmath55 the offset is in the @xmath56 direction .",
    "the @xmath0-field lines are distorted in all directions .",
    "this distortion depends on parameters @xmath1 ( related to the magnitude of the shift of the pc from the magnetic axis ) and @xmath57 ( we choose @xmath51 in what follows ) .",
    "if we set @xmath2 the symmetric case reduces to a symmetric static dipole .",
    "the distance by which the pcs are shifted on the ns surface is given by @xmath58,\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the standard half - angle of the pc .",
    "this effective shift of the pcs is a fraction of @xmath60 ; therefore it is a larger fraction of @xmath46 for pulsars with shorter periods @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that for the rvd solution , @xmath61 , where offsets as large as @xmath62 are associated with msps with large @xmath60 .",
    "however , @xmath63 is expected for ff fields , with the larger offset values related to msps @xcite .",
    "the difference between our offset - pc field and a dipole field that is offset with respect to the stellar center can be most clearly seen by performing a multipolar expansion of these respective fields .",
    "@xcite gives the scalar potential @xmath64 for an equatorially offset dipole ( eod ) field as @xmath65 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath66 being the offset parameter , and with the first few leading terms in @xmath67 listed above . from this potential",

    "conversely , our offset - pc field may be written as @xmath70    therefore , we can see that the eod consists of a centered dipole plus quadropolar and other higher - order components ( equation  ( [ eq : offsetdipole ] ) ) , while our offset - pc model ( equation  ( [ eq : symm - offset ] ) ) consists of a centered dipole plus terms of order @xmath71 or @xmath72 . since @xmath73 and @xmath74 , the latter terms present perturbations ( e.g. , poloidal and toroidal effects ) to the centered dipole .",
    "@xcite derived these perturbed components of the distorted magnetic field while satisfying the solenoidality condition @xmath75 .",
    "we performed geometric light curve modeling using the code first developed by @xcite .",
    "we extended this code by implementing an offset - pc dipole @xmath0-field ( for the symmetric case ) , as well as the sg @xmath76-field corrected for gr effects ( see section  [ sec : implementation ] ) .",
    "we solve for the pc rim as explained in section  [ sub : epsilon_extend ] .",
    "the shape of the pc rim depends on the @xmath0-field structure at @xmath77 .",
    "once the pc rim has been determined , the pc is divided into self - similar ( interior ) rings .",
    "these rings are calculated by using open - volume coordinates ( @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) .",
    "after the footpoints of the field lines on a ( @xmath78,@xmath79 ) grid have been determined , particles are followed along these lines in the corotating frame and emission from them is collected in bins of pulse phase @xmath80 and @xmath7 , i.e. , a sky map is formed by plotting the bin contents ( divided by the solid angle subtended by each bin ) for a given @xmath6 , and it is therefore a projection of the radiation beam . to simulate light curves ,",
    "one chooses a sky map corresponding to a fixed @xmath6 , then fixes @xmath7 and plots the intensity per solid angle .",
    "the code takes into account the structure / geometry of the @xmath0-field ( since the photons are emitted tangentially to the local field line ) , aberration of the photon emission direction ( due to rotation , to first order in @xmath81 ) , and time - of - flight delays ( due to distinct emission radii ) to obtain the caustic emission beam @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite pointed out that previous studies assumed the rvd field to be valid in the instantaneously corotating frame , but actually it is valid in the laboratory frame ( implying corrections that are of second order in @xmath81 ) .",
    "this implies a revised aberration formula , which we have implemented in our code .",
    "since the offset - pc dipole field is specified in the magnetic frame ( @xmath82 ; @xcite ) , it is necessary to transform this solution to the ( corotating ) rotational frame ( @xmath83 ) . in order to do so",
    ", we first need to rotate the cartesian coordinate axes specified in the rotational frame through an angle @xmath84 to move to the magnetic frame , and then perform transformations between the cartesian and spherical coordinates in the magnetic frame . only then can we transform the @xmath0-vector components from a spherical base unit vector set to a cartesian one .",
    "we lastly perform a rotation of the cartesian @xmath0-vector components through @xmath85 , to move from the magnetic to the rotational frame .",
    "see the appendix for a systematic discussion .",
    "the object is to find the polar angle @xmath86 at each azimuthal angle @xmath87 at the footpoints of the last open @xmath0-field lines , lying within a bracket @xmath88 , such that the field line is tangent to the light cylinder .",
    "the pc rim is thus defined .",
    "the magnetic structure at the light cylinder therefore determines the pc shape @xcite .",
    "after initial implementation of the offset - pc dipole field in the geometric code , we discovered that we could solve for the pc rim in a similar manner as for the rvd @xmath0-field , but only for small values of the offset parameter @xmath1 ( @xmath89 , depending on @xmath6 ) .",
    "we improve the range of @xmath1 by varying the colatitude parameters @xmath90 and @xmath91 , which delimit a bracket (  solution space \" ) in colatitude thought to contain the footpoint of last open field line ( tangent to the light cylinder @xmath77 ) .",
    "we obtain a progressively larger range of @xmath1 upon decreasing @xmath90 and increasing @xmath91 .",
    "we find a maximum @xmath92 valid for the full range of @xmath6 . choosing a maximal solution bracket in colatitude would in principle work , but the code would take much longer to find the pc rim compared to when a smaller bracket ( that does contain the correct solution ) is used .",
    "therefore , we generalize the search for optimal @xmath90 and found ( by trial and error ) that the following linear equation @xmath93\\theta_{\\rm pc}$ ] , for a fixed @xmath94 , resulted in @xmath90 that yielded maximum values for @xmath1 .",
    "we illustrate the pc shape for a few cases of @xmath6 and @xmath1 in figure  [ fig : od_pcshape ] .",
    "we plot the pc rims ( @xmath95 ) in the @xmath96 plane ( in the magnetic frame , in units of @xmath97 ) , assuming that the @xmath39-axis is located perpendicularly to the page at @xmath98 and that @xmath99 is measured counterclockwise from the positive @xmath53-axis .",
    "each pc is for a different value of @xmath6 in the range @xmath100 with increments of @xmath101 . for each @xmath6",
    "we plot the pc shape for @xmath1 values of @xmath102 ( green solid circle ) , @xmath103 ( red dashed circle ) , and @xmath104 ( blue dashed@xmath9dotted circle ) .",
    "the horizontal line at @xmath105 ( black dotted line ) serves as a reference line to show the magnitude and direction of offset as @xmath1 is increased . as @xmath6 and @xmath1",
    "are increased the pc shape changes considerably . for larger @xmath1 the pc offset is larger along the @xmath106-axis ( in the direction of `` unfavorably curved '' @xmath0-field lines ) . also , as @xmath6 increases for each @xmath1 the pc shape along the @xmath53-axis becomes narrower and irregular , e.g. , compare the cases of @xmath2 and @xmath92 for @xmath107 .",
    "we note that the pc also becomes slightly narrower along the @xmath56-axis as @xmath1 increases .",
    "it is important to take the accelerating @xmath3-field into account when such expressions are available , since this will modulate the emissivity @xmath108 ( as a function of arclength @xmath109 along the @xmath0-field line ) in the gap as opposed to geometric models where we assume constant @xmath17 per unit length in the corotating frame . for the sg case",
    "we implement the full @xmath3-field in the rotational frame corrected for gr effects ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this solution consists of a low - altitude and high - altitude limit which we have to match on each @xmath0-field line .",
    "the low - altitude solution is given by a. k. harding ( 2016 , private communication ) @xmath110\\sin\\alpha\\big\\}(1-\\xi_\\ast^2),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath111 , @xmath112 the radial @xmath0-field component , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 the colatitudinal gap width in units of dimensionless colatitude @xmath115 .",

    "there have been several indications that _ the sg @xmath3-field may be larger than initially thought .",

    "a larger @xmath3-field ( increased by a factor of 100 ) led to ( iii ) statistically improved @xmath22 fits with respect to the light curves . moreover , the inferred best - fit @xmath6 and @xmath7 parameters for this @xmath3-field ( iv ) clustered near the best fits of independent studies .",
    "we additionally observed that a larger sg @xmath3-field also ( v ) increased the particle energy gain rates and therefore yielded a larger particle energy @xmath19 ( giving cr that is visible in the _ fermi _ band ) as well as leading to a crr regime already close to the stellar surface .",
    "these evidences may point to a reconsideration of the boundary conditions assumed by @xcite which suppressed the @xmath340 at high altitudes .",
    "they assumed equipotentiality of the sg boundaries as well as the steady state drift of charged particles across the sg @xmath0-field lines , implying @xmath424 at high - altitudes , with the flux of charges remaining constant up to high altitudes .",
    "one possible way to bring self - consistency may be implementation of the newly developed fido model that includes global magnetospheric properties and calculates the @xmath0-field and @xmath3-field self - consistently .",
    "we envision several future projects that may emanate from this study",
    ". one could continue to extend the range of @xmath1 for which our code finds the pc rim , since more complex field solutions , e.g. , the dissipative and ff field structures , may be associated with larger pc offsets . however , the offset - pc dipole solutions have limited applicability to outer magnetosphere emission since they use the static dipole frame and do not model the field line sweep back . therefore , it would be preferable to investigate the @xmath0-fields and @xmath3-fields of the dissipative models and solve the transport equation to test if the particles reach the crr limit .",
    "the effect of these new fields on the phase plots and light curves can also be studied .",
    "there is also potential for multi - wavelength studies , such as light curve modeling in the other energy bands , e.g. , combining radio and @xmath8-ray light curves ( see @xcite ) .",
