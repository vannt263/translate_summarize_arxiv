    "the galaxy luminosity function is an important quantity in the study of galaxy evolution and formation .",
    "traditionally , galaxy luminosity functions have been derived in optical bands .",
    "it is now clear that extragalactic studies in optical bands suffer several systematic uncertainties and complexities compared to those using near infrared bands . in particular",
    ", dust extinction has little effect on @xmath0-band magnitudes ; the k - correction in the @xmath0-band is a much smaller and better understood quantity than in the optical bands , and it is independent of galaxy spectral types for @xmath9 . because of this it is easier to detect a high redshift elliptical galaxy in an infrared band than in optical bands .",
    "a galaxy s near infrared luminosity is also a good tracer of its stellar mass independent of spectral type @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical studies show that the @xmath0-band galaxy luminosity function is a powerful constraint on galaxy formation theory @xcite .",
    "most near infrared surveys , however , have been modest in size due to the small size of available infrared detectors .",
    "the advent of large format infrared array detectors has made possible a variety of wide - field near - infrared surveys , ranging from several at the 10 deg@xmath10-level @xcite up to the largest of them all , the 2 micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) @xcite .",
    "obtaining optical redshifts for a @xmath0-selected sample , however , is difficult because the wide range in optical - infrared colours results in the requirement for a wide range of exposure times to acquire optical spectroscopy . in particular , very long exposures are required to secure redshifts for the reddest objects .",
    "because of this there are only a few @xmath0-band luminosity functions available .",
    "the early @xmath0-band luminosity functions were derived from small size samples with number of galaxies ranging from 100 to 500 @xcite .",
    "after the second incremental release of 2mass data , two teams @xcite used the overlap between the 2mass extended source catalog ( http://pegasus.phast.umass.edu ) and two existing optical redshift databases , cfa2 @xcite and 2dfgrs ( http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/2dfgrs ) , to obtain very large ( @xmath11 ) , if very shallow ( @xmath12 ) , @xmath0-selected redshift samples to derive the local @xmath0-band luminosity function .",
    "however , the mean redshift for these samples is shallow , 0.025 for the cfa sample@xcite and 0.05 for the 2df sample@xcite .",
    "the observational goal of the hawaii - aao @xmath0-band redshift survey was to obtain a large medium - deep @xmath0-selected galaxy sample with redshifts and optical - infrared colors .",
    "both optical ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) and near - infrared ( @xmath0 ) images were taken at mauna kea observatory with total infrared coverage of totaling 8.22 @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic observations were carried out on the anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) with the two degree field facility ( 2df ) . in this paper",
    "we report @xmath0-band luminosity functions derived from a sub - sample of 1056 bright ( @xmath1 ) galaxies .",
    "the median redshift of this sample is 0.138 with the redshift distribution tail extending to z=0.5 . in this paper",
    ", we adopt the @xmath6 and @xmath7 and @xmath15 cosmology model .",
    "a comparison of the @xmath0-band luminosity functions derived using different cosmology models is also presented .",
    "we briefly summarize the observation and data reduction in @xmath162 ; in @xmath163 , we present the @xmath0-band luminosity functions ; in @xmath164 , we compare our luminosity function with other s and discuss the difference ; we summarize our results in @xmath165 .",
    "@xcite have described in detail the acquisition and processing of our @xmath13-,@xmath14- and @xmath0-band imaging . in brief , the imaging survey was carried out at mauna kea observatory and represents over 70 nights of time on the university of hawaii 88-inch and 24-inch telescopes .",
    "the survey consists of four equatorial fields covering a total area of 8.22deg@xmath10 .",
    "the optical and near - infrared limiting magnitudes are @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "the spectroscopic observations for the @xmath0-selected sample were carried out at the aat with 2df , a multi - fiber spectrograph that can observe 400 targets within a 2 degree field of view .",
    "these observations took approximately 10 clear nights spread out over the period 19971999 . the exposure time for a spectroscopic observation",
    "was determined by the @xmath14 magnitude of each object , for objects with @xmath20 ( @xmath21 the @xmath22 limit ) 1 hour exposure times sufficed , for the redder objects ( @xmath23 ) exposure times of up to 4 hours were used .",
    "weather variations meant that some 2df observations were not as deep as others .",
    "when a redshift was not secured at a first attempt the object was flagged for re - observation in a later 2df configuration .",
    "multiple 2df configurations were observed on each field to ensure maximal completeness .",
    "our @xmath1 sample is highly complete in redshift . from a total of 1201 objects imaged with @xmath1 ,",
    "redshifts were obtained for 1056 galaxies .",
    "a further 59 objects turned out to be stars , leaving only 86 objects without identification .",
    "these objects are assumed to be galaxies for the purposes of incompleteness correction .",
    "fig.1 shows the redshift distribution of the sample .",
    "the median redshift for the @xmath24 sample is 0.136 .",
    "we calculate absolute magnitudes with a @xmath6 and @xmath7 cosmology and use recently published k - correction due to @xcite .",
    "k - corrections have also be tested using spectral evolution models which best fit the observed colours @xcite .",
    "no significant difference was found in either the k - corrections or the resulting luminosity functions .",
    "we use the stepwise maximum likelihood ( swml ) @xcite to derive the non - parametric luminosity function , and use the sty method @xcite to fit the schechter function to the data . after obtaining @xmath8 and @xmath25 by fitting schechter function to our data",
    ", we use the minimum variance estimator @xcite to determine the @xmath26 . both sty and swml methods",
    "are based on the maximum likelihood principle , and therefore only valid for a complete galaxy redshift sample .",
    "correction for our sample s ( small ) incompleteness is therefore needed . @xcite",
    "have shown that a _ weighted sty _ method can be used to derive a luminosity function from an incomplete sample . in the weighted sty method , if a galaxy in the sample has no redshift , similar galaxies with redshifts ( ie .",
    "similar magnitude , or similar colour , or both ) receive increased weight in calculating the likelihood to represent the galaxy without a redshift ,    @xmath27    here the @xmath28 is the probability for galaxy i at redshift @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the luminosity function , and @xmath31 is the weight for galaxy i. @xmath32 for a complete sample , otherwise @xmath33 .    in our case only 7% of targets do not have redshifts , so such a correction does not make a large difference .",
    "we fit schechter functions to the sample both with , and without , correction .",
    "we follow @xcite in estimating the weight function for each galaxy with redshift in the sample .",
    "we divide the sample into apparent magnitude and color @xmath34 bins , and the weight @xmath31 assigned to galaxy i with redshift @xmath29 is the ratio of total number of galaxies over the total number galaxies with redshifts in the bin where the galaxies i is .",
    "since the incompleteness of the 4 fields varies , we have to calculate @xmath31 for galaxies in each field separately .",
    "table  1 summarizes the result of the sty fitting with 3 different cosmological models , and fig .",
    "2 shows the non - parametric k - band luminosity function and the schechter function in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 universe .",
    "as shown in table  1 , the parameters of the schechter function depend on the adopted cosmological models .",
    "this is because the median redshift is 0.138 , where the effect of the geometry for the adopted cosmology model appears in calculating distance , and the change of @xmath25 is due to the correlation between @xmath8 and @xmath25 .",
    "there is a slight difference between the luminosity functions derived with correction and without correction .",
    "the @xmath8 calculated with correction is slightly brighter than that calculated without correction .",
    "this is because most of the galaxies without redshifts are near the @xmath35 limit and are either bright galaxies at relatively high redshifts comparing with rest of the sample , or local lower luminosity galaxies .",
    "similar galaxies with redshifts in the sample are assigned more weight .",
    "the consequence is to cause @xmath8 to become somewhat brighter and the faint end stope slightly steeper after correction .    using the higher spatial resolution @xmath14-band images",
    ", @xcite was able to make a morphological classification for the very bright galaxies ( @xmath36 ) . among 225 galaxies with @xmath36 in the sample , @xcite classified 111 galaxies as e / s0 .",
    "most of the remaining 114 galaxies are spirals , and only a few with peculiar morphologies are possible mergers or irregular galaxies .",
    "therefore , we are able to derive the luminosity function of early type ( e / s0 ) and later type ( spiral and irregular galaxies ) for the @xmath36 sample . fig  3 shows the the @xmath0-band luminosity function for both types with the best fitting schechter functions . the @xmath0-band luminosity function for the early type galaxies has a bright @xmath8 of @xmath37 and a flat slope @xmath38 , while that for the later type galaxies has a much fainter @xmath8 of @xmath39 and a steeper slope @xmath40",
    "recently , several @xmath0-band luminosity functions were derived either directly from @xmath0-band surveys @xcite , or from optical samples with @xmath0-band images @xcite .",
    "these luminosity functions are roughly in agreement with each other , given that most samples are small in size and have large statistical uncertainty .",
    "to compare the @xmath0-band luminosity functions in different cosmology models , @xcite convert all existing @xmath0-band luminosity functions to those in the @xmath41 and @xmath7 cosmology model .",
    "table 2 shows the parameters of schechter function for all @xmath0-band luminosity functions , including those we adopted from @xcite and ours .",
    "we also list sample size and limiting magnitude for each survey .    by comparing the schechter functions",
    ", our luminosity function has a brighter @xmath8 and a steeper slope , only those of @xcite are close to ours .",
    "the rest of the luminosity functions have a @xmath8 at least 0.3 magnitude fainter than ours and a flat slope ( @xmath42 ) , including two 2mass luminosity functions @xcite and that of @xcite who had a similar sample to ours . for more accurate comparison",
    ", we plot the luminosity functions against each other in fig .",
    "4 . fig .  4",
    "shows that our luminosity function is higher and steeper than the 2mass luminosity functions and that of @xcite .",
    "this is in agreement with the comparison in schechter functions that the 2mass luminosity functions have fainter @xmath8 , lower @xmath43 , and flat @xmath25 .",
    "there are two different important aspects between our sample and the 2mass sample@xcite : different ways of measuring total magnitudes for galaxies and different redshift ranges for both sample .",
    "each of them could cause the difference in deriving luminosity function .",
    "if we assume that both photometric methods measure true total magnitudes for @xmath0-selected galaxies , the difference between both @xmath0-band luminosity functions implies a change of luminosity function at different redshift ranges . since our sample covers a wider redshift range , we are able to derive the @xmath0-band luminosity function in the lower redshift bin . this will allow us to test if we are able to reproduce the results from the 2mass sample using our lower redshift bin sample .",
    "the limiting magnitude in both @xcite samples are around @xmath44 , which is too bright for our sample to be statistically significant .",
    "however we can adopt a redshift limited subsample which approximates their redshift range , it will simply extend @xmath45 2 magnitudes further down the luminosity function .",
    "thus we set the limiting redshift @xmath46 , to approximate the redshift range to those of the 2mass sample while allowing us to have enough galaxies to derive the luminosity function .",
    "4 shows that our luminosity function for the subsample with @xmath46 matchs those luminosity functions of @xcite very well .",
    "we also fit the schechter function to our subsample with @xmath46 , and obtain that @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 consistent with those derived using the 2mass samples .",
    "this implies that the normlisation of the luminosity function is a function of redshift , even at lower redshifts , and that this explains the apparent discrepancy in published estimates without needing to invoke systematic errors in deriving total magnitudes in both samples .",
    "the steep slope of our @xmath0-band luminosity function is actually consistent with those of optical luminosity functions obtained in several current wide - field optical surveys .",
    "@xcite drived a @xmath13-band luminosity function with @xmath50 using a large redshift sample obtained in the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) .",
    "@xcite , and the sdss team obtained the optical luminosity functions in @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 bands , and the @xmath25 for these luminosity functions in the 5 bands are @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 respectively .",
    "@xcite used the average color to transfer the sdss @xmath55-band luminosity function to a @xmath0-band luminosity function with @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 , which are very close to the parameters of our luminosity function .",
    "we would like to point out that the peak of the redshift distribution for the sdss sample is about 0.1 , much closer to ours than to those of the 2mass sample @xcite .",
    "the implies that the normalization of the luminosity function is a function of redshift , even at lower redshifts , and that this explains the apparent discrepancy in published estimates without needing to invoke systematic errors in deriving total magniutdes in both sample .",
    "before the 2mass sample was available , there were no k - selected samples with morphological classification , hence no type - dependent k - band luminosity functions .",
    "@xcite derived k - band luminosity function for the emission line galaxies ( elg ) and also for the galaxies without emission lines ( non - elg ) .",
    "he found that the @xmath8 of the k - band luminosity function for elg is one magnitude fainter than that for non - elg .",
    "for the first time , @xcite was able to derive the @xmath0-band luminosity function for both early and later type galaxies",
    ". we can compare ours with those of @xcite .",
    "since both samples have very bright limiting magnitudes , @xmath64 for @xcite and @xmath65 for our sample , the effect of the geometry for the adopted cosmology models can not make any significant difference in calculating absolute magnitudes at such a low redshift .",
    "we can compare the two results directly . in table  3",
    "we list the @xmath8 and @xmath25 derived from both our @xmath65 sample and the 2mass sample @xcite .",
    "our @xmath0-band luminosity function for early type galaxies has a similar @xmath8 and @xmath25 to those of @xcite , but the luminosity functions for later type galaxies are more different : our @xmath8 is 0.3 magnitude brighter and our slope is much steeper ( @xmath66 ) than theirs ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "steep slopes ( @xmath68 ) for later type galaxy luminosity functions are also seen in the optical bands @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of the universal luminosity density is another way of testing consistency between optical and infrared luminosity functions @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that the spectrum of the universal luminosity density can be fitted by an average spiral galaxy sed @xcite . @xcite used the average spiral galaxy sed model to fit the luminosity densities derived from the sdss luminosity function , and find that the model predicts the luminosity densities at @xmath69 and @xmath0 bands should be 2.3 times higher than the values derived from the 2mass luminosity functions . in fig .  5",
    ", we reproduce the luminosity density plots by adding our points .",
    "our @xmath0-band luminosity density is about 2 times higher than those derived from the 2mass samples@xcite , much closer but still lower than what the model predicts .",
    "the luminosity density of our subsample with @xmath46 is consistent with those from the 2mass sample .",
    "this is not surprising since they are derived using similar luminosity functions .",
    "our luminosity density for the @xmath1 sample is measured at a mean redshift of @xmath70 , comparable to sdss and 2dfgrs _ optical _ samples .",
    "however the 2mass-(sdss,2dfgrs ) paired catalogs are much shallower , @xmath71 , thus it seems that the most likely explanation is that 2mass is sampling a local underdensity in the galaxy distribution .",
    "however it is now clear that at a redshift @xmath72 there is no broad mismatch in optical and ir luminosity densities .",
    "we also notice that the model , the average spiral galaxy sed @xcite plus a constant tail ( @xmath73 ) at short wavelength @xcite , does not fit the luminosity densities well , in detail , either .",
    "we present a large and highly complete large @xmath0-selected redshift sample down to @xmath74 , and use it to derive the @xmath0-band luminosity function using both non - parametric and sty methods . by comparing with previous @xmath0-band luminosity functions ,",
    "our @xmath0-band luminosity function has a significantly brighter characteristic luminosity and steeper slope .",
    "the slope is the same as in the optical determinations .",
    "the @xmath0-band luminosity density measured from our sample is 2 times higher than those measured from the 2mass redshift sample , the largest local @xmath0-selected redshift sample .",
    "we argue that this deeper survey , of comparable depth to the optical and sdss surveys , is more strictly comparable in luminosity density and that we have in fact resolved the discrepancy of the 2mass survey .",
    "we are also able to re - produce the the 2mass @xmath0-band luminosity function using similar sunsample with @xmath46 .",
    "we also derive the @xmath0-band luminosity functions for both early and later type galaxies .",
    "the early type galaxies have a bright @xmath8 and a flat slop @xmath42 , while the later type galaxies have a faint @xmath8 and a steep slope @xmath75 .",
    "a steep slope for later type galaxies is also found in the current large optical redshift surveys .",

    "<S> this is consistent with what have been found in optical type dependent luminosity function . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0-band luminosity density derived using our luminosity function is now measured at a similar redshift depth to optical luminosity densities in the sdss redshift survey . </S>",
    "<S> it is 2 times higher than the previous measurement from the shallower 2mass sample and resolves the previously reported discrepancies between optical and near - ir luminosity densities . </S>"
