    "the causes of the dramatic cosmic evolution of agn ( e.g.  dunlop & peacock 1990 ; hartwick & schade 1990 ) remain unclear , we have little knowledge of how and why agn form , how quasar activity is triggered and sustained in a galaxy , and what extinguishes the activity .",
    "the findings that agn are often associated with other galaxies is believed to indicate that interactions between galaxies may play a role , since interactions are more likely to occur in a dense environment .",
    "host galaxies and their close companions have been found to display disturbed morphology ( e.g.  bahcall et al .",
    "1997 ; canalizo & stockton 2001 ) , also taken as a sign that interactions have taken place . even in cases where companion galaxies appear undisturbed in the optical , radio images taken at redshifted 21 cm ( of nearby agn )",
    "show long bridges or tidal tails of hi gas connecting the agn with a close neighbour @xcite .",
    "these observations have raised the question of the existence and the nature of a physical link between the agn and its environment .",
    "two very different scenarios for this link have been suggested , the merger / interaction and the cooling flow scenario .",
    "ellingson , green & yee found evidence for the merger / interaction scenario when they made multi - object spectroscopy of galaxies associated with optically luminous quasars .",
    "they found that the richest quasar host clusters have abnormally low velocity dispersions compared to those of clusters in general with similar optical richness .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that galaxy - galaxy interactions are related to the quasar phenomenon , ( e.g.  hutchings , crampton & campbell 1984 ) , since in dynamically young clusters where the galaxies have low velocities , the encounters between galaxies will be disruptive and perhaps trigger or fuel quasar activity in one of the interacting galaxies .",
    "further support for this was found by yee & green and ellingson et al .   in their studies of quasar environments .",
    "optically luminous quasars were found more frequently in rich environments at @xmath2 than at lower redshifts , suggesting that by @xmath30.4 , the quasars in rich clusters have faded .",
    "since the time elapsed between @xmath4 and @xmath5 corresponds to the dynamical time scales of cluster cores , they proposed that dynamical changes in the cluster environments were responsible for the fading of quasars , perhaps as a result of lack of gaseous fuel after the clusters virialize .",
    "accordingly , highly luminous agn should therefore not exist in rich clusters at low redshifts , but there are several examples which contradict this , demonstrating that the requirement of non - virialized clusters is not sufficient .",
    "one example is cygnus a , a powerful frii radio galaxy in a rich cluster at @xmath6 .",
    "two other examples , which we study in this paper , are 3c 295 and e1821@xmath0643 .",
    "3c 295 is a powerful frii radio galaxy in a cluster at @xmath7 , and e1821@xmath0643 is an optically luminous quasar at @xmath8 situated in a very rich cluster .",
    "the cooling flow scenario has been discussed by e.g.   fabian et al .  ,",
    "fabian & crawford and bremer , fabian & crawford . in this picture ,",
    "cooling flows in sub - clusters at earlier epochs provide fuel for the agn , but as sub - clusters merge toward the present epoch , the cooling flows are disrupted and the quasar activity switched off .",
    "alternatively , the quasar may switch off when the cooling flow gas is exhausted @xcite .",
    "several observations have been made of extended emission - line gas around powerful quasars which seem to support the cooling flow model ( e.g.  crawford & fabian 1989 ; forbes et al .",
    "1990 ; bremer et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "however , it is not established yet whether extended emission line gas indicates the presence of a cooling flow .",
    "for instance , the emission lines could be produced by radio source shocks instead of gas cooling out of the flow ( e.g.  tadhunter et al .",
    "the standard cooling flow model ( fabian 1994 and references therein ) has received some criticism lately since _ xmm _ observations of cooling flow clusters do not show emission lines at temperatures below 1 kev as predicted ( peterson et al .",
    "2001 ; tamura et al .  2001 ; kaastra et al .  2001 ) .",
    "this suggests that the cooling flow model may need to be re - evaluated , and in many cases mass deposition rates may turn out to be lower than originally thought .",
    "heating by agn has been proposed as a possible cause of the apparent lack of cold gas , but new _ chandra _ data seem to indicate that the coolest gas is close to the radio lobes , contrary to what is expected if there is heating by the agn ( fabian 2001 ) .",
    "if cooling flows were the chief mechanism for providing fuel to the most powerful agn in clusters , we should observe more rich clusters with central , powerful agn than we do .",
    "in fact , most rich agn host clusters do not contain anything more powerful than an fri source ( like m87 in the virgo cluster ) . in a sample of 260 rich - cluster radio galaxies studied by ledlow , owen & eilek , there are almost no frii radio galaxies with luminosities at 1.4 ghz greater than @xmath9 whz@xmath10 .",
    "hall et al .   and hall , ellingson & green used x - ray data from _ rosat _ and _ einstein _ to derive physical parameters , such as gas density and temperature , of agn host clusters .",
    "their aim was to distinguish between three different models for the evolution of agn in clusters , the young cluster scenario , the cooling flow model , and a model of decreasing icm density with increasing redshift ( stocke & perrenod 1981 ) .",
    "three of the five clusters in their sample were not detected , but upper limits on their x - ray luminosity could be estimated .",
    "they found that neither a cooling flow nor a decrease in icm density could explain all their observations , and proposed that strong interactions between the agn host and another galaxy in the cluster could be the only necessary mechanism to produce powerful agn in clusters .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the link between four powerful agn and their environments by using weak lensing methods .",
    "the weak lensing technique allows us to probe the distribution of _ total _ mass ( dark + luminous ) in the agn fields , and the mass distributions can be used to test the merger / interaction and the cooling flow scenarios .",
    "the two scenarios make very different predictions about the dynamical state of agn host clusters , and by investigating the cluster dynamics , it may be possible to find which , if any , of these two mechanisms are responsible for the agn  environment link .",
    "a cooling flow is expected to be associated with a single deep potential well in an evolved , virialized cluster @xcite , and in this case we expect a strong weak lensing signal and a mass distribution characterized by only a single peak .",
    "in contrast , if the agn activity is related to galaxy interactions , these will be much more disruptive if the encounter velocities are relatively low and comparable to the internal velocity dispersions of the galaxies involved .",
    "consequently , a cluster that is still forming will be preferred , as in such a cluster there is an increased probability for low - velocity encounters . a dynamically young cluster is expected to have an irregular mass distribution , possibly with several sub - clumps @xcite .",
    "our method of cluster selection is based on the detection of weak gravitational shear and the presence of an agn .",
    "this is different from the usual methods of detecting clusters , by optical richness or x - ray luminosity . whereas optical and x - ray cluster surveys are biased toward the most baryon - rich systems , clusters selected by their weak shear signal are biased toward the most massive systems in terms of dark+luminous mass .",
    "if there is a large range in the baryonic - to - dark matter ratio in clusters , clusters with high mass - to - light ( hereafter m / l ) ratios will have been missed in optical and x - ray surveys . although we present a case - by - case study here ,",
    "it is nevertheless interesting to compare the masses and the m / l ratios of the agn host clusters to those of clusters detected on the basis of optical richness or x - ray luminosity .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section  [ section : s2 ]",
    "we describe the selection of the targets and review some of their properties .",
    "section  [ section : s3 ] describes the observations and the data reduction . before the weak lensing analysis",
    "is performed , we investigate the colour - magnitude diagrams of the clusters in section  [ section : s4 ] .",
    "the purpose of this is to locate the colour - magnitude relation in the known clusters , e1821@xmath0643 and 3c 295 , and thereby identify cluster galaxies that do not contribute to the weak lensing signal .",
    "we also investigate the colour - magnitude diagram of 3c 254 and discuss whether there is evidence for a red sequence of early - type cluster galaxies in this field . a brief introduction to the weak lensing method and how we measure the gravitational shear",
    "is given in section  [ section : s5 ] .",
    "we follow the standard approach for ground - based data and use the kaiser , squires & broadhurst formalism to correct for psf anisotropies using the imcat software , and the approach by luppino & kaiser to calibrate galaxy ellipticities to gravitational shear . in section  [ section : s6 ] , we present the results of the analysis by showing maps of the projected surface mass density in the fields , plots of the shear profiles in the clusters , and estimates of masses and m / l ratios .",
    "the results are discussed in section  [ section : s7 ] , and conclusions are drawn in section  [ section : s8 ] .    our assumed cosmology has @xmath11 kms@xmath10mpc@xmath10 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "kpc at @xmath8 , 3.4@xmath14 kpc at @xmath7 , 3.7@xmath14 kpc at @xmath15 and 4.0@xmath14 kpc at @xmath1 , the redshifts of the targets in this study . ]",
    "we selected four powerful agn with extended x - ray emission for this study .",
    "two of the targets are well - known cases of an agn associated with a galaxy cluster , the radio galaxy 3c 295 and the radio - quiet quasar e1821@xmath0643 .",
    "the other two targets are the radio - loud quasars 3c 334 and 3c 254 which were found to have significant extended x - ray emission in moderately deep _ rosat _ pointings ( hardcastle & worrall 1999 ; crawford et al .",
    "for the former two sources , we know that the extended x - ray emission originates in the hot intra - cluster medium of the host clusters , but in the latter two cases no host clusters are known .",
    "their extended x - ray emission is however an indicator of clustered galaxy environments provided that the point - like x - ray emission from the agn has been properly subtracted , and that the extended component does not originate in processes associated with the agn itself .",
    "this is a powerful frii radio galaxy at @xmath7 with compact radio structure . in the optical ,",
    "the radio galaxy is classified as a cd , and its host cluster has been extensively studied both at optical ( mathieu & spinrad 1981 ; dressler et al .",
    "1997 ; smail et al .  1997a ,",

    "1998 ) and x - ray wavelengths ( henry & henriksen 1986 ; mushotzky & scharf 1997 ; neumann 1999 ; allen et al .  2001 ) .",
    "it is not a particularly optically - rich cluster , most likely of abell class 1 ( mathieu & spinrad 1981 ; hill & lilly 1991 ) , but its velocity dispersion is high , @xmath16 kms@xmath10 @xcite .    in x - rays",
    ", it appears to be a dynamically evolved and relaxed cluster with a high bolometric luminosity of @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "it was suggested by henry & henriksen that the cluster hosts a cooling flow , later confirmed by neumann .",
    "allen et al . have studied the cluster with the _ chandra _ x - ray satellite and find that the cooling flow is 24@xmath18 gyr old , with a mass deposition rate of 70@xmath19 m@xmath20yr@xmath10 .",
    "3c 295 was one of the first two clusters in which a weak gravitational lensing signal was detected @xcite , and smail et al .",
    "have performed weak lensing analysis on this field using hst wfpc2 data .",
    "the cluster displays signs of strong lensing and a quadruple lens has also been found ( fisher , schade & barrientos 1998 ; lubin et al .",
    "since this cluster is well - studied , it serves as a consistency check on our techniques .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     [ table : tab4 ]      the m / l ratio parameterizes the amount of dark matter in clusters .",
    "we have already measured the amount of total mass in the clusters , and by estimating the optical luminosity of the clusters , we may find their m / l ratios .",
    "we processed the images in sextractor with a tophat convolution filter matched to the seeing , and for each extracted object , aperture magnitudes within 2.6 arcsec and ` best ' magnitudes were evaluated .",
    "stars were identified on the basis of a plot of fwhm versus the sextractor star - galaxy classifier , and removed from the catalogues by rejecting objects that had a star - galaxy class greater than @xmath21 and a fwhm corresponding to the seeing .",
    "the best seeing catalogue was thereafter matched to the catalogue in the other filter on the basis of object positions , with a tolerance of 3 pixels .",
    "a final catalogue was then made containing galaxies detected in both @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( or @xmath24 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 for e1821@xmath0643 ) .",
    "the galaxy colours were calculated using the aperture magnitudes , and the cluster early - type galaxies were again selected by their location on the colour - magnitude relation . for consistency , we used the same sigma clipping algorithm as described in section  [ section : s4 ] to define the colour - magnitude relations from the sextractor detections , but obtained very similar results to those listed in table  [ table : tab2 ] .",
    "the @xmath24-band luminosity in solar units of each galaxy on the colour - magnitude sequence was evaluated using the ` best ' @xmath23 magnitudes converted to absolute @xmath24 magnitudes by first applying an @xmath23-band @xmath25-correction for e / s0 galaxies from rocca - volmerange & guiderdoni , and thereafter adding the rest - frame @xmath26 of elliptical galaxies ( fukugita , shimasaku & ichikawa 1995 ) .",
    "the @xmath25-corrections applied for the three clusters in order of increasing redshift were 0.18 , 0.39 and 0.635 .",
    "we converted to solar @xmath24 luminosity by adopting @xmath27 .",
    "the procedure to compute m / l ratios as a function of radius is similar to that described for the @xmath28-statistic ; the luminosity density within a given aperture is compared to the luminosity density within a control annulus .    the argument for using the early - type galaxy light to calculate the m / l ratio is that most of the light , and also most of the mass , is associated with the early - type cluster galaxies .",
    "kaiser et al .",
    "find that 70 per cent of the total excess light within their cluster apertures comes from early - type galaxies .",
    "they also argue that fairly accurate estimates of cluster luminosities can be obtained from the early - type cluster population since the noise due to foreground and background contamination will be greatly reduced .",
    "smail et al .",
    "also point out that using the early - type galaxy light for the m / l ratio makes it easier to compare with other clusters since the blue galaxy fraction is known to vary from cluster to cluster .",
    "nevertheless , we also calculated the m / l ratio obtained by selecting all galaxies at @xmath29 . by subtracting off the luminosity density in the control annulus",
    ", any uniform component will be removed , thereby limiting the contamination by field galaxies . in doing this , the galaxies on the colour - magnitude relation were converted to absolute @xmath24 luminosities as described above , whereas the rest of the galaxies were @xmath25-corrected assuming an sa - type galaxy at the cluster redshift and a rest frame colour of @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the sa - type @xmath25-corrections we used were , in order of increasing cluster redshift , 0.09 , 0.22 and 0.38 @xcite .",
    "the results for the 3c 295 and the e1821@xmath0643 clusters are shown graphically in fig .",
    "[ figure : fig14 ] .",
    "the errors in the m / l ratio were calculated assuming photometric errors of 0.1 mag in addition to the previously given errors in the mass .",
    "the early - type m / l ratios we find for the two clusters 3c 295 and e1821@xmath0643 lie typically between @xmath31500@xmath18 and 1000@xmath18 ( m / l)@xmath20 at the different radii , and the m / l ratios which include all galaxies are typically 300 - 500@xmath18 ( m / l)@xmath20 , depending on the radius .",
    "smail et al .",
    "get an early - type m / l ratio in @xmath22-band of 900@xmath18 ( m / l)@xmath20 within 400@xmath14 kpc for the 3c 295 cluster . assuming an average colour of @xmath32 for the galaxies , corresponding to that of an sab - type galaxy ( fukugita et al .",
    "1995 ) , and adopting @xmath33 , we get that smail et al.s m / l ratio converts to @xmath34 ( m / l)@xmath20 in @xmath24-band .",
    "this agrees with our estimate of 2050@xmath351420 ( m / l)@xmath20 within the same radius .    in the 3c 254 field",
    ", we find 39 galaxies with @xmath36 within the radius of the outer control annulus .",
    "this is clearly too few galaxies to obtain a reliable result with the method described above .",
    "the m / l ratio for the 3c 254 cluster is therefore highly uncertain at this point .",
    "we note that the m / l ratios we find are moderately high .",
    "the mean early - type m / l ratio obtained by smail et al .",
    "for their ten clusters at @xmath370.5 is ( m / l@xmath38)@xmath39 , and the median is 410@xmath18 ( m / l)@xmath20 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath40 and @xmath41 in the @xmath24-band , so the values of @xmath42 we get are moderately high in comparison . when the whole galaxy population is included , it is found that rich clusters where the early - type fraction is high have m / l ratios of typically @xmath43400@xmath18 ( m / l@xmath44)@xmath20 ( bahcall , lubin & dorman 1995 ; carlberg et al .  1997 ; dahle et al .",
    "2002 , in prep . ) .",
    "our corresponding number for the e1821@xmath0643 and the 3c 295 cluster is ( m / l@xmath45 ) @xmath46 ( m / l)@xmath20 .    .",
    "the points are shifted slightly in the x - direction for clarity . ]",
    "our results for the 3c 295 cluster are in agreement with what has been found for this cluster previously , i.e.  the cluster is massive and has a high velocity dispersion , and the m / l ratio is moderately high .",
    "it also shows signs of strong lensing at a radius close to the einstein radius we would predict from our weak lensing measurements , suggesting that there is a large concentration of mass in the core ( @xmath47 m@xmath20 ) and that the cluster potential is deep .",
    "the mass distribution in the e1821@xmath0643 cluster is relatively smooth , apart from some asymmetry to the nw .",
    "the same asymmetry is present in the early - type cluster light , indicating that the feature in the mass map is real .",
    "the asymmetry could be caused by a group or a sub - cluster that has fallen in and merged with the main cluster .",
    "if this is the case , the merger is probably in a fairly advanced stage since the mass distribution is elongated rather than double - peaked .",
    "one of the cluster members in the direction of the asymmetry ( 41 arcsec n and 15 arcsec w of the quasar ) is an fri radio galaxy .",
    "since fri galaxies are known be central cluster galaxies ( longair & seldner 1979 ; prestage & peacock 1988 , 1989 ; hill & lilly 1991 ) , we speculate that a sub - cluster or a galaxy group associated with the fri source has merged with the main cluster .",
    "dynamical activity in clusters is relatively common , more than 30 per cent of clusters show evidence in x - rays of merging @xcite . the same fraction of activity is also found in weak lensing studies @xcite , suggesting that many clusters are still forming by merging of sub - clusters and galaxy groups .",
    "the morphology of the mass distribution in the 3c 254 field is highly uncertain because the reconstruction is relatively noisy , but it appears to be a very massive cluster with a high velocity dispersion , @xmath48 kms@xmath10 . because of random noise , the position of the mass peak is also uncertain , but the position of the peak in the galaxy light distribution is easier to constrain .",
    "galaxies with the expected colours of ellipticals at the quasar redshift are concentrated in a region 40 arcsec s of the quasar .",
    "the @xmath23-band image reaches a completeness limit of @xmath49 , corresponding to @xmath50 magnitudes fainter than @xmath51 at the quasar redshift , so the image should be deep enough to trace the most massive galaxies of the early - type population in a @xmath1 cluster .",
    "the 40 arcsec offset between the quasar and the peak in the early - type galaxy light ( assuming the colour - selected galaxies lie at the quasar redshift ) is not what we expect if the quasar sits in a massive cooling flow as suggested by crawford & vanderriest ( 1997 ) .",
    "a cooling flow cluster is expected to be evolved and have a deep potential well , and the early - type cluster galaxies should be centrally concentrated",
    ". it would therefore be interesting to know where the mass map peaks in relation to the quasar and the early - type galaxy light , but in our reconstruction , the positional errors are too large to address this .",
    "is it possible that foreground or background structure may contaminate the morphology and the mass estimate of the cluster in the 3c 254 field ?",
    "we found in section  [ section : s41 ] what appears to be a foreground group or cluster , possibly at @xmath4 , but it lies at a large angular distance from the quasar and is unlikely to have altered the morphology of the mass distribution around the quasar . also , any background structure at a significantly larger redshift than the quasar would need to have an unrealistically high mass to alter the reconstruction .",
    "the evidence for an association of the detected mass with the 3c 254 quasar is the following : 1 ) the mass distribution has a peak which is , within the uncertainties , centered on the quasar , 2 ) there is significant , extended x - ray emission around the quasar ( crawford et al .  1999 ; hardcastle & worrall 1999 ) , 3 ) the quasar is surrounded by an extended emission - line region which signifies gas under high pressure ( forbes et al .",
    "1990 ; crawford & vanderriest 1997 ) , and 4 ) there is an apparent excess of galaxies around the quasar @xcite . in the rest of the discussion",
    "we therefore assume that the cluster is associated with the quasar , but not necessarily centered on it .",
    "how do the clusters we have studied here fit into the interaction / merger scenario and the cooling flow model for fuelling agn in clusters ? both the distribution of mass and galaxies in the clusters detected at high signal - to - noise , e1821@xmath0643 and 3c 295 , are fairly smooth , and their velocity dispersions are high .",
    "unless there is sub - cluster merging along the line of sight , this indicates that the clusters are evolved and dynamically relaxed .",
    "they therefore do not fit well into the scenario where galaxy - galaxy interactions in dynamically young clusters fuel the agn .",
    "also , the moderately high m / l ratios we find seem to argue against this picture",
    ". one might expect that in a young non - virialized cluster , the cluster core would contain a smaller fraction of the total mass since the mass would still not have accumulated there , thus giving a lower m / l ratio than a virialized cluster .    whereas the 3c 295 cluster is known to contain a cooling flow ( henry & henriksen 1986 ; neumann 1999 ; allen et al .",
    "2001 ) , it is less certain that the other two clusters have cooling flows .",
    "so , although we can not rule out the cooling flow model for the clusters , it seems possible that powerful agn can exist in massive clusters with deep potential wells without being powered by cooling flows .",
    "e.g.  hall et al .   suggested that strong interactions between the agn host and a gas - rich galaxy is the only necessary mechanism for triggering and fuelling agn in clusters .",
    "however , as pointed out by hall et al .",
    ", this predicts that the agn hosts have disturbed morphology and that the clusters are dynamically young .",
    "if instead interactions between galaxies can occur in dynamically relaxed clusters which have undergone mergers , this could explain our findings .",
    "if a merger between two galaxies can push gas into the centre of a galaxy , perhaps a merger between two clusters could result in a whole galaxy being pushed towards the cluster centre .",
    "a cluster merger event could thus disrupt the orbits of some galaxies and send them down into the centre of the potential well where the agn host galaxy sits .",
    "if the infalling galaxy is rich in gas , it could end up as a source of fuel for the agn .",
    "even if the dynamical friction is too low and the infalling galaxy never interacts strongly with the agn host , it could end up losing gas to the host , or at least disturb the gas in the host galaxy itself .",
    "this scenario predicts that systems containing powerful agn show a high incident of cluster mergers .",
    "the m / l ratios of the clusters studied here seem to be moderately high compared to clusters in general .",
    "this could mean that they are indeed very massive and have high x - ray temperatures , typical for old clusters where the mass is more concentrated than the light @xcite .",
    "another interesting possibility is that agn - selected clusters have systematically higher m / l ratios than purely x - ray or optically selected clusters .",
    "this might indicate that x - ray and optical surveys are biased toward clusters with high baryon - to - dark matter ratios , and could be important to cosmology as it may affect estimates of @xmath52 in matter derived from analysis of known clusters @xcite .",
    "although our sample is too small to draw conclusions about the properties of agn host clusters in general , we can at least point to some interesting facts about clusters hosting powerful agn :    1 .   they can be very massive systems with masses of a few times 10@xmath53 m@xmath20 within the central @xmath54 kpc .",
    "2 .   they can have very high velocity dispersions of 10001600 kms@xmath10 3 .",
    "one shows evidence of a cluster merger event ( e1821@xmath0643 ) 4 .",
    "even though the few clusters studied here are consistent with being drawn from the general cluster population , there is some tentative evidence that they tend to have higher m / l ratios than clusters in general    the data presented here do not point unambiguously to either the cooling flow model or the young cluster model for fuelling powerful agn in clusters .",
    "points i ) and ii ) above support the cooling flow model since cooling flows are expected to occur in dynamically relaxed clusters with deep potential wells . on the other hand , point iii )",
    "argues against the cooling flow model , and more in favour of the young cluster model , although the e1821@xmath0643 cluster is clearly relaxed .",
    "our study has demonstrated that it is possible to find and study massive clusters associated with agn using weak lensing techniques .",
    "there seems to be good reasons for expecting moderately rich clusters around the most luminous @xmath55 radio sources ( e.g.  best 2000 ) , and weak lensing observations in these fields might reveal whether they are indeed surrounded by clusters .",
    "the authors would like to thank the anonymous referee for a thorough reading of the manuscript , and for valuable comments and suggestions which helped improve the presentation of this paper .",

    "<S> the host clusters of e1821@xmath0643 and 3c 295 are comfortably detected via their weak lensing signal , and we report the detection of a cluster - sized mass concentration in the field of the @xmath1 quasar 3c 254 . </S>",
    "<S> the data for the 3c 334 field are so far inconclusive . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the clusters are massive and have smooth mass distributions , although one shows some evidence of past merger activity . </S>",
    "<S> the mass - to - light ratios are found to be moderately high . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the results in light of the cooling flow and the merger / interaction scenarios for triggering and fuelling agn in clusters , but find that the data do not point unambiguously to neither of the two . </S>",
    "<S> instead , we speculate that sub - cluster mergers may be responsible for generating close encounters or mergers of galaxies with the central cluster member , which could trigger the agn .    </S>",
