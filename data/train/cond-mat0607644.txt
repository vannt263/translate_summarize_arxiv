    "the random - field ising model ( rfim ) is one of the simplest model to study the combined effects of interaction and disorder in many - body systems . in particular",
    ", the response of the rfim to a slowly varying magnetic field at zero temperature@xcite illustrates the athermal dynamical behavior observed in several experimental systems in condensed matter physics such as disordered ferromagnets , superconductors , martensitic materials , etc .",
    "this response is characterized by avalanches and rate - independent hysteresis .",
    "recently , the model has also been transposed to the context of finance and human behavior@xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to study the @xmath0  rfim in a situation that has not been considered so far , when one varies the overall magnetization and not the magnetic field ( which then becomes a derived quantity that we will call the `` output '' field ) .",
    "more generally , we want to describe the behavior of athermal systems under control of the _ extensive _ variable conjugated to the intensive force . this concerns for instance the stress - strain curves in shape - memory materials that are usually obtained by controlling the deformation of the sample and measuring the induced stress@xcite .",
    "one also uses a feedback control that imposes a constant variation of the magnetic flux in the case of ferromagnets with a very steep magnetization curve@xcite .    for a system at equilibrium ,",
    "it is of course equivalent to control the force or the conjugated variable : the system follows a well - defined curve which corresponds to the minimum of the energy or the free - energy .",
    "this curve may be continuous or discontinuous , as is the case at a first - order phase transition .",
    "the situation is more complicated when thermal fluctuations are too small to overcome the energy barriers and the system remains far from thermodynamic equilibrium on the experimental time scale .",
    "it then follows a metastable , history - dependent path , and there is no reason for observing the same behavior with the two protocols .",
    "in fact , there is experimental evidence that hysteresis loops obtained by varying extensive variables display bending - back trajectories ( with a so - called yield point ) , and large fluctuations in the measured force ( or field)@xcite .    in order to simulate this situation with the @xmath0 rfim",
    ", one needs to introduce a dynamical rule that states how to flip the spins as the magnetization is changed .",
    "there are of course different ways of locally minimizing the energy and the choice for the dynamics is not unique , even if one imposes a deterministic rule so to get the same result when repeating the simulation . in this work ,",
    "we propose to modify the standard single - spin - flip dynamics in a _",
    "minimal _ way , so that the new dynamics may be considered as the `` magnetization - driven '' version of the dynamics used in the field - driven case@xcite .",
    "the main advantage is that there is a close connection between the microscopic trajectories followed by the system with the two protocols and the results for the macroscopic quantities ( for instance the internal energy ) can be readily compared ,    another and more delicate issue concerns the definition of the magnetic field as an output variable .",
    "the solution that we adopt is again very simple but can not be considered as fully satisfactory .",
    "in another recent work@xcite , a different approach was proposed , extending the study to finite temperatures so to define the field as a lagrange multiplier .",
    "comparison between these two approaches is discussed below .",
    "part of our study is performed on a bethe lattice with connectivity @xmath3 ( or , equivalently , on random graphs with the same connectivity ) .",
    "this is to benefit from the fact that an almost complete analytical description is available in the field - driven case@xcite .",
    "comparing our simulation data with these exact results will help in understanding the similarities and differences between the two protocols .    in section [ model",
    "] , we review the model in the usual field - driven situation and introduce the modifications in the dynamics so to describe the magnetization - driven case .",
    "the simulation results for the bethe lattice are discussed in section [ bethe ] and those for the 3-d cubic lattice in section [ 3d ] .",
    "we summarize our main findings and conclude in section [ discussion ] .",
    "the rfim with single - spin - flip local relaxation dynamics was specifically introduced for studying the @xmath2-driven situation .",
    "it is thus usually formulated from a microscopic hamiltonian @xmath6 that corresponds to the magnetic enthalpy . for the present study , it is convenient to first introduce the internal energy @xmath7 : @xmath8 where @xmath9 are spin variables defined on the sites @xmath10 of a lattice and the first sum extends over all nearest - neigbor pairs ( the coupling constant is taken as the energy unit and set to unity ) .",
    "the random fields @xmath11 are i.i.d .",
    "variables sampled from the gaussian distribution @xmath12 with standard deviation @xmath13 .",
    "the enthalpy @xmath6 is then defined as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the overall magnetization . in the following ,",
    "we consider two types of lattice : a 3-d cubic lattice and a bethe lattice with connectivity @xmath3 . in the first case ,",
    "numerical simulations are performed on finite lattices of size @xmath16 with periodic boundary conditions . in the second case , they are performed on random graphs with fixed connectivity @xmath3 which provide a convenient realization of the bethe lattice in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the standard @xmath2-driven dynamics consists in locally minimizing the enthalpy @xmath6 . as the external field @xmath2 is changed , each spin is aligned with its total local field @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and the summation is over all the @xmath19 neighbors @xmath20 of @xmath21 .",
    "a configuration @xmath22 is then ( meta)stable when all the spins satisfy the condition .",
    "@xmath23 one usually starts the metastable evolution with @xmath24 and all spins @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath2 is then increased until the total local field vanishes at a certain site .",
    "this first occurs for the spin with the largest random field , @xmath26 .",
    "this spin is then flipped , which in turn changes the local field at the neigbors and may trigger an avalanche of other spin flips .",
    "the avalanche stops when a new stable configuration is reached .",
    "@xmath2 is then increased again until a new spin becomes unstable and the evolution continues until all the spins flip up .",
    "the upper half of the hysteresis loop is obtained in a similar way by decreasing the field from @xmath27 to @xmath28 .",
    "note that the external field @xmath2 is kept constant during an avalanche , which corresponds to a complete separation of time scales between the driving mechanism and the internal relaxation of the system ( the dynamics is then referred to as `` adiabatic '' ) .",
    "because the interactions are purely ferromagnetic , the dynamics has also some remarkable properties : it is abelian@xcite ( the order in which unstable spins are flipped during an avalanche is irrelevant for determining the final state ) and it satisfies return - point memory@xcite . an important feature is the existence of a critical amount of disorder @xmath29 below which the hysteresis loops are discontinuous in the thermodynamic limit , the jump in the magnetization corresponding to the occurence of a macroscopic avalanche@xcite .",
    "one has @xmath30 for the cubic lattice@xcite and @xmath31 for the bethe lattice with connectivity @xmath3@xcite .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows an example of an @xmath2-driven metastable evolution on a random graph with connectivity @xmath3 .",
    "for the sake of comparison with the @xmath1-driven protocol that is introduced in the next section , we plot the internal energy per spin @xmath32 as a function of the magnetization per spin @xmath33 ( both quantities being parametrized by the external field @xmath2 ) .",
    "the metastable states @xmath34 , ... visited by the dynamics are represented by triangles while the dashed lines in - between indicate the avalanches .",
    "note that the total number of states when @xmath2 is varied from @xmath28 to @xmath27 depends on the disorder strength and on the particular realization of the random fields . typically , there are only a few states when @xmath13 is small ( most avalanches are large ) whereas the number of states approaches its upper limit @xmath35 when @xmath13 is large .    finally , we want to stress that the energetic barriers between the metastable states are strictly defined by the dynamics .",
    "in fact , the very definition of the metastable states ( i.e. the stability rule ( [ stabh ] ) ) can not be separated from the use of the single - spin - flip dynamics .",
    "it has been shown recently that a slightly better minimization of the enthalpy ( obtained by allowing also simultaneous flips of nearest - neigbor spins ) yields much thinner hysteresis loops while not changing the critical behavior of the system@xcite .",
    "we now define an irreversible dynamics for the case where the magnetization of the system is changed externally .",
    "there is no external field and the potential that has to be minimized ( at least partially ) is the internal energy @xmath7 . our goal is to generate a sequence of states @xmath34 , ... when @xmath1 is increased from @xmath36 to @xmath37 by elementary steps @xmath38 .",
    "as noted in the introduction , we want this dynamics to be as close as possible to the single - spin - flip dynamics used in the @xmath2-driven case .",
    "for instance , we require that the two driving mechanisms become equivalent when the spins behave independently and the hysteresis vanishes ( either because the coupling constant is zero or @xmath39 ) . in this limit , one must thus flip , for each value of @xmath1 , the spin with the largest random field , @xmath26 . in the general case",
    ", we propose to use the simplest `` extremal '' dynamics : the spins are flipped one by one ( like in the @xmath2-driven case ) and , for each value of @xmath1 , one chooses the spin that _ most _ decreases or , at least , _ less _ increases the internal energy .",
    "this is the spin with the largest local field , @xmath40 , and the corresponding change in the energy is @xmath41 .",
    "after the spin has been flipped , the local fields @xmath42 at the neigbors are updated and the same rule is applied until all spins are flipped .",
    "one obtains a different sequence of states when starting from @xmath37 and decreasing the magnetization , which yields an hysteresis loop .",
    "it may be remarked that this new dynamics bears some similarity with the `` extremal '' dynamics used in simple models of self - organized criticality ( see e.g. ref.@xcite ) .",
    "however , in the present case , one never reaches a statistically stationary state because each spin in the system flips only once and @xmath43 evolves between @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    by construction ,",
    "the total number of states visited by the dynamics is now @xmath35 and the crucial feature is that this sequence of states contains _ all _ the @xmath2-driven metastable states as a subsequence .",
    "this is due to the abelian property of the @xmath2-driven dynamics and can be easily understood by noticing that i ) the two dynamics start with the same initial state ( with all @xmath25 or @xmath45 ) , and ii ) the spins that are flipped successively within the @xmath1-driven dynamics are either those which trigger an @xmath2-driven avalanche or those which are involved in this avalanche . in other words ,",
    "the dynamical rule that has been chosen generates a sequence of states that are obtained by flipping _ in a certain order _",
    "the spins involved in the @xmath2-driven avalanches .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] which shows the sequences of states obtained with the two dynamics in the @xmath46 plane .",
    "one can see that the @xmath1-driven trajectory is a sort of random walk that joins the metastable states belonging to the @xmath2-driven trajectory .",
    "a more problematic ( but separate ) issue concerns the definition of the output field @xmath2 associated to the changes in the magnetization .",
    "as will be discussed below in more detail , one difficulty is that many of the states visited by the dynamics are not metastable .",
    "this means that is not possible to find a field that allows for the condition ( [ stabh ] ) to be satisfied for all spins .",
    "this is because the local field @xmath42 at some spins down is larger than the local field at some spins up ( it is easy to see from eq.([stabh ] ) that the condition for a microscopic configuration @xmath22 to be metastable at some field @xmath2 is that @xmath47 , the minimum value of the local field among the spins up , is larger than @xmath40 , the maximum value of the local field among the spins down ) . in this respect ,",
    "the present situation is totally different from the one considered in ref .",
    "@xcite where all the states obtained with the @xmath1-driven dynamics are stable .",
    "an additional difficulty is that there is no obvious way to define an intensive quantity conjugated to @xmath1 , playing the same role as the lagrange parameter introduced in ref .",
    "the simple solution that we propose is to define the field in such a way that the work needed to go from the state at @xmath1 to the state at @xmath48 is minimal .",
    "the field thus identifies with the internal force , @xmath49 ( in order to facilitate the comparison with the @xmath2-driven dynamics we use the same notation for the external and the output field . for the metastable states that are common to the two dynamics , the field defined by eq .",
    "( [ defh ] ) is exactly the external field at which these states become marginally stable . )",
    "@xmath50 is not a monotonously increasing function of the magnetization .",
    "in fact , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] in the case of a very small system , it strongly fluctuates with @xmath43 .",
    "this is a quite different behavior from the one observed for the magnetization in the @xmath2-driven case .",
    "note however that one can easily deduce the @xmath2-driven trajectory from the @xmath1-driven one ( when the magnetization is put on the horizontal axis ) : it is just the envelope function that tracks the increasing maxima of @xmath50 .    a direct consequence of eq.([defh ] )",
    "is that the @xmath1-driven dynamics does not yield any dissipation .",
    "indeed , since the work @xmath51 is just equal to the variation of the internal energy , the area of any closed loop ( that goes back to the same microscopic state ) is zero .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the situation in the @xmath2-driven case in which the work is larger than @xmath52 inside the avalanches .",
    "although the experimental hysteresis loops obtained in @xmath1-driven conditions have a much smaller area than the @xmath2-driven loops@xcite , it is not true that the dissipation is zero .",
    "we shall come back to this issue in section [ discussion ] where we discuss some possible modifications in the definition of the field so to avoid this `` unphysical '' feature .",
    "the two preceding algorithms allow to simulate a finite system for a given realization @xmath53 of the random fields .",
    "comparison with experiments should be performed by considering the limit @xmath54 .",
    "it is then desirable that the results are self - averaging , i.e. that they do not depend on a particular realization of the disorder in the thermodynamic limit .    in this respect ,",
    "the situation is different when one is controlling the external field @xmath2 or the magnetization @xmath1 . in the former case",
    ", one can divide a macroscopic system into a large number of macroscopic subsystems that are all submitted to the _ same _ external field .",
    "then , according to a standard argument@xcite , away from criticality , the value of the density of any extensive quantity on the whole system ( for instance the magnetization @xmath55 ) is equal to the average of the ( independent ) values of this quantity over the subsystems . according to the central limit theorem ,",
    "this quantity is distributed with a gaussian probability distribution and ( strongly ) self - averaging@xcite . on the other hand , in the latter case",
    ", one can not decompose a system into subsystems having the same magnetization and the standard argument does not apply .",
    "this implies that i ) one must carefully study the behavior of the sample - to - sample fluctuations of an observable as the system size increases so to conclude whether or not this observable is self - averaging , and ii ) one must be cautious in giving a physical meaning to the average over disorder .    in the following ,",
    "we analyze the self - averaging character of an observable @xmath56 by performing histograms over many disorder realizations for a given size @xmath35 , so to estimate the probability distribution @xmath57 .",
    "we then study the behavior of the variance @xmath58 as @xmath35 increases ( here @xmath59 denotes the average over disorder at constant @xmath1 , which has to be distinguished from @xmath60 , the average over disorder at constant @xmath2 ) .",
    "@xmath56 is ( strongly ) self - averaging if @xmath61 when @xmath62 .",
    "in this section we present the numerical results obtained by simulating the @xmath1-driven dynamics on random graphs with fixed connectivity @xmath3 .",
    "since small loops are rare in these graphs ( their typical size is of order @xmath63 ) , the results in the large-@xmath35 limit are expected to converge to the results on a true bethe lattice , i.e. in the deep interior of a cayley tree . for the sake of completeness , we first recall the analytical expressions for the average magnetization per spin @xmath64 and the average internal energy per spin @xmath65 as a function of the external field @xmath2@xcite :    @xmath66",

    "14 ) in ref.@xcite with @xmath76 ) .    when computing @xmath77 , it is important to take into account the fact that eq .",
    "( [ past ] ) has three real roots in a certain range of @xmath2 below @xmath29 .",
    "then , the magnetization curve obtained from eq .",
    "( [ mag ] ) has an s - shape behavior@xcite , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . the correct physical solution that gives the lower branch of the hysteresis loop corresponds to the smallest root . for a certain value of @xmath2 ,",
    "this root is not real anymore , @xmath77 jumps to the largest root and there is a discontinuity in the magnetization curve associated to the occurence of an infinite avalanche . in this context , the intermediate , unstable branch of the s - shape curve ( from points a to b in the figure ) has no physical meaning ( on the other hand , the branch bc can be reached via first - order reversal curves obtained from the descending branch of the hysteresis loop , as noted in refs.@xcite ) .      as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , which corresponds to the simulation of a small system , there are a few states along the @xmath1-driven trajectory that are metastable although they do not belong to the @xmath2-driven subsequence ( this could be seen as well in the @xmath46 diagram since this property does not depend on the definition of the field ) .",
    "of course , the fact that the state visited by the dynamics is stable or not depends on the disorder realization .",
    "is is therefore useful to introduce the quantity @xmath78 that represents the average fraction of states that are stable . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , these additional metastable states appear less and less frequently as the system size increases and there is strong numerical evidence that they completely disappear in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "therefore , when @xmath62 , @xmath78 also represents the average fraction of metastable states along the @xmath2-driven trajectory .",
    "the results of the simulations with the @xmath1-driven dynamics below and above @xmath29 and different system sizes are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . for @xmath79",
    ", it is found that @xmath78 is minimum in the range of @xmath43 that corresponds to the steepest part of the @xmath2-driven magnetization curve where the avalanches are the largest . for @xmath80 , the interval where @xmath81 exactly corresponds to the range of the infinite avalanche ( including in the portion bc of the magnetization curve , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the fact that @xmath78 is _ strictly _ smaller than @xmath82 ( except for @xmath83 ) deserves some explanation . with the @xmath2-driven algorithm",
    ", there is indeed a certain probability , for a finite system , that a given value of @xmath1 corresponds either to an horizontal portion of the magnetization curve ( a metastable state ) or to a vertical jump ( an avalanche ) . although the magnetization curve is continuous in the thermodynamic limit ( except for the jump below @xmath29 ) , the probability of `` hitting '' a metastable states remains smaller than @xmath82 when @xmath62 .",
    "in other words , @xmath78 tracks the random presence of `` holes '' in the magnetization curve that correspond to the avalanches .",
    "this suggests that @xmath78 is related to the probability of having an avalanche between @xmath2 and @xmath84 ( where @xmath2 is the field corresponding to @xmath43 in the thermodynamic limit ) .",
    "this probability is given by the quantity @xmath85 defined by eq .",
    "( [ rh ] ) and the seeked relation is @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the inverse slope of the magnetization curve in the thermodynamic limit , a quantity that is easily computed from eq .",
    "( [ mag ] ) .",
    "one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] that the agreement between the simulations and the analytical formula is indeed very good .",
    "the proof of eq .",
    "( [ qm ] ) relies on the assumption that the occurrence of avalanches ( as @xmath2 is monotonously increasing ) corresponds to a non - stationary poisson process@xcite . for a finite system of size @xmath35",
    ", an avalanche then occurs in the interval @xmath88 with a rate @xmath89 ( recall that @xmath74 , as calculated in ref.@xcite , is a probability per spin ) .",
    "the mean range of stability @xmath90 of a metastable state before an avalanche occurs is given by the inverse of the rate , i.e. @xmath91 ( note that this quantity becomes infinitesimal in the thermodynamic limit . )",
    "since only metastable states contribute to the variation of @xmath2 in the interval @xmath92 ( the field is kept constant during an avalanche ) , the average slope of the magnetization curve in the thermodynamic limit is given by @xmath93 which yields eq .",
    "( [ qm ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to remark that eq .",
    "( [ qm ] ) gives a finite , positive value of @xmath78 between points b and c in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) when one computes @xmath94 using the largest root of eq .  ( [ past ] ) .",
    "indeed , as already noted , this part of the @xmath2-driven hysteresis loop can be reached by an appropriate field history starting from saturation : this implies that the fraction of metastable states is not zero . on the other hand",
    ", one gets a meaningless negative value for @xmath78 between points a and b and the correct physical result @xmath81 , that states that all configurations are unstable , is recovered by setting @xmath95 in eq .  ( [ qm ] ) .",
    "we now discuss the simulation results for the internal energy per spin @xmath96 . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , we plot on a log - log scale the variance @xmath97 for selected values of @xmath43 as a function of the system size @xmath35 . both above and below @xmath29",
    ", it is found that @xmath98 decrease like @xmath99 , showing that the energy is a strongly self - averaging quantity , a result that is not _ a priori _ obvious .",
    "accordingly , we shall now use the average value of @xmath96 to compare with the exact results obtained with the @xmath2-driven dynamics in the thermodynamic limit , although @xmath100 may not be a well - defined physical quantity , as remarked above .",
    "rather , this must be considered as a convenient way of suppressing sample - to - sample fluctuations .",
    "the comparison is performed in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] where @xmath101 is obtained by plotting @xmath102 as a function of @xmath103 , the field @xmath2 being considered as a parameter ( see also fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . when @xmath80 , there is a jump in the magnetization and the corresponding discontinuity in @xmath104 is represented by a dashed line , the solid line representing the internal energy along the intermediate , unstable part of the magnetization curve .",
    "it can be seen hat the behavior of @xmath96 changes with @xmath13 . for large disorder",
    ", the energy has a `` double well '' structure whereas there is a single well when the disorder is small .",
    "the change in the behavior occurs at @xmath105 and is therefore not related to the critical value of the disorder at which the discontinuity in the @xmath2-driven magnetization curve disappears .",
    "note moreover that the curves are not symmetric with respect to @xmath106 : there is indeed hysteresis when the magnetization is increased from @xmath44 or decreased from @xmath45 .    the most remarkable feature in fig .  [ fig6 ]",
    "is that the average internal energy obtained with the @xmath1-driven algorithm appears to coincide with the analytical curve obtained from eq .",
    "( [ ener ] ) in the thermodynamic limit _ even _ when @xmath43 is in the range of the macroscopic avalanche for @xmath80 ( the agreement is better than @xmath107 for @xmath108 ) . since this is a surprising result , we have carefully checked the behavior as a function of the system size ( note incidentally that finite - size effets are not negligible in the @xmath2-driven case as well : this is an issue that has not yet been investigated , as far as we know ) .    when all avalanches are of microscopic size , the coincidence of the energy along the two trajectories is due to the fact that the stable states before and after the avalanche ( and therefore all the unstable states in - between ) differ only by a finite ( i.e. , non - extensive ) number of spin - flips .",
    "accordingly , the energy of these states can not differ by an extensive quantity and one has @xmath109 in the thermodynamic limit , as can be checked numerically .",
    "moreover , since both the energy and the magnetization are self - averaging quantities , the averages at fixed @xmath43 or fixed @xmath2 yield the same result . therefore , @xmath110    it is more surprising that the equality @xmath111 is also satisfied _ inside _ the macroscopic avalanche if one uses the `` unphysical '' root of eq .",
    "( [ past ] ) to compute @xmath104 along the unstable branch of the @xmath2-driven magnetization curve .",
    "we have no obvious explanation for this result but we want to stress that it crucially depends on the order in which the spins are flipped during an avalanche . indeed , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , a different curve @xmath100 is obtained if one decides for instance to flip the spin that _ less _ decreases the energy .",
    "therefore , the @xmath1-driven dynamics that has been chosen is precisely the one that yields agreement with the analytical solution computed in ref .  .",
    "this suggests that behind the probabilistic computation in ref .",
    "there is perhaps some hidden minimization principle that fixes unambiguously the trajectory along the unstable branch .      as illustrated by figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig8 ] , the output field @xmath50 defined by eq .",
    "( 5 ) displays a sporadic , discontinuous behavior with magnetization .",
    "when a spin flips , the local field at the neigbors is changed by @xmath112 , and this is indeed the approximate size of the fluctuations observed in fig .",
    "this of course does not depend on the system size and the same behavior should be observed in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we shall come back to this important issue in section [ discussion ] .",
    "another consequence of the definition of the field as an extremal quantity is that it exhibits large sample - to - sample fluctuations .",
    "in fact , it is found that the variance does not decrease with @xmath35 , which means that each sample behave differently , even in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "it is however instructive to study in detail the probability distribution @xmath113 for different values of @xmath43 above and below @xmath29 .    the evolution of the normalized histograms as a function of system size is shown in fig .  [ fig9 ] .",
    "one can see that the distributions are wide and rather complicated .",
    "on the one hand , there is a well - defined peak on the right - hand side of the histograms whose height increases and width decreases as @xmath35 increases .",
    "this peak , however , does not exist for @xmath80 when @xmath43 is in the range of the infinite avalanche ( for instance @xmath114 in the left panel of the figure ) . on the other hand",
    ", there is another contribution which extends over a finite range and which is almost size - independent : it is responsible for the fact that the field is not self - averaging . by analyzing the sequence of microscopic states along each @xmath1-driven trajectory , we have checked that these two contributions come from the stable and unstable states , respectively .",
    "since they are no other stable states than those belonging to the @xmath2-driven magnetization curve in the thermodynamic limit ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , we therefore conjecture that the distribution @xmath113 has the following asymptotic form : @xmath115 w(h;m ) \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] where @xmath116 is the dirac function , @xmath117 is the field along the magnetization curve ( i.e. the field taken as a function of the magnetization ) , and @xmath118 is a continuous distribution on a finite interval @xmath119",
    ". moreover , there is strong numerical evidence that @xmath120 for @xmath79 and for @xmath80 outside the range of the macroscopic avalanche , whereas @xmath121 inside the infinite avalanche .",
    "the statistical behavior of the field for a given value of the magnetization is thus different above and below @xmath29 . for @xmath79 ,",
    "the most probable value of @xmath50 is the one corresponding to the @xmath2-driven magnetization curve ( the two protocols thus give the same field - magnetization diagram ) , but there is a finite probability that it takes a smaller value . for @xmath80 and @xmath43 inside the range of the infinite avalanche , one has @xmath81 and the delta peak disappears . in this case , the value of the field is impredictable inside a finite interval .",
    "very similar results are obtained on the 3-d cubic lattice . in this case , however , the @xmath2-driven behavior cannnot be treated exactly in the thermodynamic limit and one must also perform simulations on finite systems .    fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] shows the fraction of stable states along the @xmath1-driven trajectory .",
    "the curves are similar to the ones displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] except for a stronger asymmetry .",
    "again , one finds that @xmath81 when @xmath43 is in the range of the @xmath2-driven macroscopic avalanche below @xmath29 .",
    "[ fig11 ] shows that the internal energy obtained with the @xmath1-driven algorithm is still a self - averaging quantity both above and below @xmath29 ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "however , it seems that the variance decreases slower than @xmath123 when @xmath43 is in the range of the infinite avalanche , a behavior also observed ref.@xcite although the definition of the field is quite different .",
    "the comparison between the two algorithms for the average internal energy as a function of @xmath43 is performed in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] .",
    "note that there is again a double well structure at low disorder but the two minima are very close to @xmath83 and hardly visible on the figure .",
    "there is only one minimum below @xmath124 , a value quite different from @xmath29 .",
    "it seems again that the two algorithms give the same energy in the thermodynamic limit ( outside the infinite avalanche ) but the finite - size effects are more important than on the bethe lattice .",
    "finally , the histograms of the field @xmath50 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] .",
    "the overall behavior is similar the one displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] and we thus conjecture that the asymptotic form of the probability distribution is given by eq . (",
    "note however that the continuous part @xmath118 has a very different shape than on the bethe lattice .",
    "in the present paper , we have proposed a simple modification of the standard single - spin - flip algorithm to study the magnetization - driven rfim at @xmath0 .",
    "the dynamics consists in flipping the spins one by one , choosing the spin with the largest local field .",
    "this allows to perform a detailed comparison with the microscopic trajectory of the system in the @xmath2-driven situation , above and below the critical disorder .",
    "it turns out that the two trajectories share the same metastable states in the thermodynamic limit , and we have computed the average fraction of these states .",
    "an exact expression of this quantity has been obtained in the case of the bethe lattice .",
    "numerical simulations show that the two dynamics yield the same internal energy for a given value of the magnetization outside the range of the macroscopic avalanche . on the bethe lattice , inside the macroscopic avalanche",
    ", the energy obtained with the @xmath1-driven algorithm also coincides with the one that can be computed analytically in the @xmath2-driven case , using the solution of the self - consistent equations that describes the unstable branch of the hysteresis loop .",
    "the @xmath1-driven field - magnetization diagram exhibits some peculiar and annoying features that are due to our definition of the output field @xmath2 as @xmath125 : i ) all closed loops have zero area , implying that there is no dissipation in the system ; ii ) @xmath2 strongly fluctuates with @xmath43 and these fluctuations are independent of the system size ; iii ) the sample - to - sample fluctuations of @xmath2 also do not decrease with the system size .",
    "we have shown that this problem is related to the presence of a continuous part in the probability distribution of @xmath2 , which corresponds to the field associated to the unstable states .",
    "we now discuss some possible modifications in the definition of the dynamics or of the field .",
    "the first one is to allow for an additional relaxation of the system using the kawasaki dynamics , which is the standard dynamics for a situation with a conserved order parameter .",
    "specifically , one could imagine to first flip the spin with the largest local field ( so to change @xmath1 ) and then perform all possible exchanges between nearest - neighbor spins of opposite sign that decrease the energy .",
    "this procedure is certainly more in the spirit of the local mean - field calculations that have been performed in ref.@xcite at finite temperature . even without changing the definition of the field",
    ", one may hope that the fluctuations of @xmath2 with @xmath1 will be weaker and will perhaps decrease with @xmath35 .",
    "however , preliminary simulations show that the energy of some states can not be decreased by exchanging nearest - neighbor spins and that many of the final states are still unstable with respect to the ( glauber ) single - spin - flip dynamics",
    ". it would be interesting to perform an extensive study in order to understand if this behavior changes when increasing the system size .",
    "on the other hand , it must be emphasize that the stable states are now different from the ones visited by the @xmath2-driven dynamics .",
    "moreover , this procedure does not solve the problem of the definition of the field ( and the correponding absence of dissipation ) .",
    "a second possibility is to keep the same dynamics as in this work , but to change the definition of the output field .",
    "indeed , it is very likely that the magnetization ( or any other extensive variable ) can only be controlled at the macroscopic level within a certain resolution .",
    "for instance , in an experiment performed at a constant rate @xmath126 , one probably measures not the instantaneous force ( in the present case @xmath127 ) but some average @xmath128 over a certain range @xmath129 ( which could even depend on the driving rate ) . in this case",
    ", one can easily check that all fluctuations are suppressed in @xmath128 in the thermodynamic limit since imposing a fixed resolution @xmath129 implies to take averages over larger and larger intervals @xmath130 when increasing @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath128 is then also self - averaging .",
    "one may also imagine that the apparatus that measures the field ( or the force ) can not ajusts itself to the force infinitely fast or that there is some threshold value .",
    "of course , in all these cases , the results are machine - dependent .",
    "carefull `` @xmath1-driven '' experiments with different set - ups and different driving rates are thus needed in order to better resolve these issues .    finally , from a theoretical point of view",
    ", one can not discard the possibility that there does not exist any satisfatory definition of the output field when using ising variables .",
    "an alternative approach using continuous variables has been proposed in ref.@xcite .",
