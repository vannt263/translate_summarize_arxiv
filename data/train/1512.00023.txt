    "additionally , we have shown that within the variational approximation , the entanglement entropies are monotonically decreasing and convex in the number of colors @xmath2 .    although the gross - neveu model is asymptotically free , its entanglement entropy is not asymptotically free for the states we studied .",
    "interestingly , the beta function of the entanglement entropy of the vacua contains a constant term which indicates that even for vanishing renormalized coupling , there is singular behavior when the renormalization group flow is integrated .",
    "this behavior would be interesting to explore further .",
    "the only other example of an asymptotically free theory for which we can variationally compute the entanglement entropy is precarious @xmath0 theory in 3 + 1 dimensions @xcite . in this theory , the beta function of the entanglement entropy is asymptotically free , in contrast with our results for the gross - neveu model .",
    "one might expect that the entanglement entropies of asymptotically free theories should have similar behavior of their renormalization group flows , but apparently this is not the case .    however , we note that the entanglement entropy in precarious @xmath0 theory is monotonically _ increasing _ in the coupling strength  that is , in the absolute value of the renormalized coupling @xcite .",
    "perhaps this distinguishing feature is responsible for the different behavior of the renormalization group flow of precarious @xmath0 theory vis -  - vis the gross - neveu model .",
    "this hypothesis seems ripe for future exploration .",
    "the variational approach presented in this paper provides powerful tools for analyzing non - perturbative features of fermionic field theories , including entanglement entropies .",
