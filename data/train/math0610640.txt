    "it is well known that the symmetric group @xmath1 is generated by various sets of transpositions , and it is natural to ask for the number of decompositions of a permutation into a minimal number of factors from such a set .",
    "for instance , a famous paper of dnes  @xcite addresses this question when the generating set is taken to consist of all transpositions .",
    "stanley  @xcite has also considered the problem for the set of coxeter generators @xmath2 .",
    "more recently , pak  @xcite considered minimal decompositions of permutations relative to the generating set @xmath3 .",
    "the elements of @xmath4 are called _ star transpositions _ because the labelled graph on vertex set @xmath5=\\{1,\\ldots , n\\}$ ] obtained from them by interpreting @xmath6 as an edge between vertices @xmath7 and @xmath8 is star - shaped .",
    "pak proves that any permutation @xmath9 that fixes 1 and has @xmath10 cycles of length @xmath11 admits exactly @xmath12 minimal length decompositions into star transpositions .",
    "he leaves open the problem of extending   to more general target permutations @xmath13 , and it is the purpose of this paper to answer this question completely .",
    "our result is best expressed in terms of _ minimal transitive star factorizations _ , which we now define .",
    "a _ star factorization _ of @xmath9 of _ length _",
    "@xmath14 is an ordered list @xmath15 of star transpositions @xmath16 such that @xmath17 .. ] we say @xmath18 is _ minimal _ if @xmath13 admits no star factorization of length less than @xmath14 , and _ transitive _ if the group generated by its factors acts transitively on @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "it is easy to see that if @xmath13 is composed of @xmath10 cycles then it admits a transitive star factorization of length @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , it can be shown  @xcite that a transitive factorization of @xmath13 into transpositions of _ any _ type must have at least this many factors .",
    "hence a transitive star factorization of @xmath13 of length @xmath19 is said to be _",
    "minimal transitive_.    our main result is the following :    [ thm : mainthm ] let @xmath9 be any permutation with cycles of lengths @xmath20 .",
    "then there are precisely @xmath21 minimal transitive star factorizations of @xmath13 .",
    "notice that pak s formula   is recovered from theorem  [ thm : mainthm ] by setting @xmath22 and @xmath23 and observing that a star factorization of a permutation with no fixed points other than ( possibly ) 1 must be transitive , since @xmath24 means any star factorization of @xmath13 involves the factor @xmath25 .",
    "consider now a permutation @xmath13 having fixed points @xmath26 and possibly 1 .",
    "a minimal ( though not transitive ) star factorization of @xmath13 should certainly _ not _ contain any of the factors @xmath27 .",
    "indeed , @xmath13 naturally induces a permutation @xmath28 on @xmath5 { \\setminus}\\{i_1,\\ldots , i_k\\}$ ] having no fixed points other than ( possibly ) 1 , and minimal star factorizations of @xmath13 are simply minimal transitive star factorizations of @xmath28 . since @xmath28 has @xmath29 cycles when",
    "@xmath13 has @xmath10 cycles , we obtain the following result by setting @xmath30 and @xmath31 in theorem  [ thm : mainthm ] .",
    "[ thm : maincor ] let @xmath9 be any permutation with cycles of lengths @xmath20 including exactly @xmath32 fixed points not equal to 1",
    ". then there are @xmath33 minimal star factorizations of @xmath13 .",
    "we prove theorem  [ thm : mainthm ] in two stages . in section  [ sec : trees ] , we give a characterization of minimal transitive star factorizations ( lemma  [ lem : characterize ] ) that is then conveniently rephrased as a bijection between such factorizations and a class of restricted words ( proposition  [ prop : prop1 ] ) . in section",
    "[ sec : counting ] we describe a correspondence between these words and certain plane trees , and finally count the trees through an application of lagrange inversion .",
    "the path we follow to theorem  [ thm : mainthm ] is therefore similar to that taken in  @xcite , and indeed we borrow techniques used there .",
    "the distinction , of course , is that our analysis accounts for cycles of arbitrary length in the target permutation .",
    "of particular note , we place no constraints on the cycle containing the symbol 1 , a fact which makes the symmetrical form of theorem  [ thm : mainthm ] somewhat surprising .",
    "throughout this section we have in mind a fixed permutation @xmath9 and a minimal transitive star factorization @xmath15 of @xmath13 .",
    "our arguments are probably best understood with a concrete example at hand .",
    "for instance , we might let @xmath18 be the factorization @xmath34 of @xmath35 it will be convenient to say that a transposition @xmath0 _ meets _ the cycle @xmath36 if @xmath36 contains the symbol @xmath37 .",
    "we shall also say @xmath16 is to the _ left _",
    "( respectively , _ right _ ) of @xmath38 if @xmath39 ( respectively , @xmath40 ) .",
    "so in the example above , @xmath41 meets @xmath42 , and @xmath43 is to the left of @xmath44 .",
    "clearly every star transposition meets exactly one cycle of @xmath13 .",
    "our goal is to give a bijection between minimal transitive star factorizations of @xmath13 and a certain restricted class of words .",
    "the construction of this bijection relies entirely on the following three supporting lemmas that characterize minimal transitive star factorizations .",
    "[ lem : order ] let @xmath36 be a cycle of @xmath13 .    1 .   if @xmath45 , where @xmath46 for all @xmath37 , then some transposition @xmath47 appears exactly twice in @xmath18 , while all transpositions @xmath48 with @xmath49 appear exactly once .",
    "2 .   if @xmath50 , then each transposition @xmath51 appears only once in @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , in the first case , if @xmath52 appears twice , then the factors of @xmath18 meeting @xmath36 appear in right - to - left order @xmath53 . in the second case , the factors meeting @xmath36 appear in right - to - left order @xmath54 .",
    "suppose @xmath45 with @xmath46 .",
    "it is clear that for @xmath18 to be transitive every transposition @xmath48 must appear at least once as a factor .",
    "let @xmath47 be the leftmost factor of @xmath18 that meets @xmath36 .",
    "if @xmath47 appeared only this once , then we would have @xmath55 , where @xmath56 fixes @xmath57 and @xmath58 fixes all @xmath59 .",
    "in particular , @xmath60 for any @xmath37 , a contradiction .    on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath50 then again transitivity requires that @xmath18 contain factors @xmath61 .",
    "so if the cycles of @xmath13 are @xmath62 , where @xmath63 contains symbol 1 , then @xmath64 meets at least @xmath65 factors of @xmath18 for @xmath66 , while @xmath63 meets at least @xmath67 factors .",
    "that is , @xmath18 has at least @xmath68 factors .",
    "but since @xmath18 is minimal transitive , it has exactly this many factors .",
    "hence all factors are accounted for and parts ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of the lemma follow .",
    "it remains to determine the relative ordering of the factors meeting @xmath36 .",
    "we return to the case @xmath45 with @xmath46 , and assume without loss of generality that @xmath52 appears twice in @xmath18 .",
    "the proof given above identified @xmath52 is the leftmost factor of @xmath18 meeting @xmath36 .",
    "however , reading the factors of @xmath18 in reverse order yields a factorization @xmath69 of @xmath70 , and the same logic now identifies @xmath52 as the leftmost factor of @xmath69 meeting @xmath36 .",
    "thus @xmath52 appears in @xmath18 in the leftmost and rightmost positions amongst all factors meeting @xmath36 .",
    "finally , note that for @xmath71 the factor @xmath72 is to the left of the rightmost occurrence of @xmath73 in @xmath18 , as otherwise we would have @xmath74 , where @xmath56 fixes @xmath75 and @xmath58 fixes @xmath76 , and this gives the contradiction @xmath77 .",
    "it follows that the factors meeting @xmath36 appear in order @xmath53 .    if instead @xmath50 , then the same logic just applied shows that for @xmath78 , the factor @xmath79 appears to the left of @xmath51 in @xmath18 .",
    "thus the factors meeting @xmath36 appear in order @xmath54 , as claimed .",
    "[ lem : between ] let @xmath36 and @xmath80 be distinct cycles of @xmath13 .",
    "suppose there exist @xmath81 such that factors @xmath82 and @xmath83 of @xmath18 meet @xmath36 while @xmath84 meets @xmath80 .",
    "then @xmath80 does not contain the symbol 1 , and all @xmath38 that meet @xmath80 have @xmath85 .    without loss of generality",
    "we may assume that if @xmath86 and @xmath87 meet the same cycle of @xmath13 , with @xmath88 , then this common cycle is @xmath80 .",
    "let @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "since @xmath82 and @xmath83 are assumed to meet the same cycle of @xmath13 , lemma  [ lem : order ] implies @xmath82 is the leftmost copy of @xmath91 in @xmath18 , @xmath83 is the rightmost copy of @xmath92 in @xmath18 , and @xmath93 .",
    "it follows from these criteria that the permutation @xmath94 fixes @xmath95 , and therefore @xmath96 is well defined .",
    "say @xmath97 .",
    "notice that @xmath16 must occur twice amongst the factors of @xmath98 , as otherwise @xmath99 and hence @xmath100 does not fix 1 , contrary to the definition of @xmath37 .",
    "suppose @xmath101 , where @xmath40 .",
    "then lemma  [",
    "lem : order ] implies @xmath102 can not appear in any factor between @xmath16 and @xmath38 , so the permutation @xmath103 fixes 1 .",
    "but since @xmath104 fixes 1 , it follows that @xmath105 also fixes 1 .",
    "thus the maximality of @xmath37 forces @xmath106 .",
    "however , if @xmath107 then we have two identical factors @xmath16 and @xmath38 , with @xmath108 , that meet the same cycle of @xmath13 , and by hypothesis this common cycle must be @xmath80 . in this case , lemma  [ lem : order ] rules out the possibility of @xmath80 containing symbol 1 ( because no transposition meeting the cycle containing 1 can appear twice in @xmath18 ) , and also implies any other factor of @xmath18 that meets @xmath80 lies between @xmath16 and @xmath38 , as desired .",
    "the remaining case is @xmath109 , in which @xmath84 occurs twice between @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "again the result follows from lemma  [ lem : order ] .",
    "the statements of lemmas  [ lem : order ] and  [ lem : between ] are crafted with the implicit assumption that @xmath15 is a minimal transitive star factorization of @xmath110 .",
    "we now show that this can , in fact , be deduced from the conditions on @xmath18 established by the lemmas .",
    "that is to say , if @xmath18 is a star factorization whose factors are related to the permutation @xmath13 in the manner described by the lemmas above , then @xmath18 is necessarily a minimal transitive star factorization of @xmath13 .",
    "[ lem : characterize ] the conditions on @xmath18 guaranteed by lemmas  [ lem : order ] and  [ lem : between ] characterize minimal transitive star factorizations of @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath111 be a star factorization that satisfies the conditions described by lemmas  [ lem : order ] and  [ lem : between ] . for brevity we shall refer to these conditions as c1 and c2 , respectively .",
    "suppose the cycles of @xmath13 are @xmath62 , with @xmath63 containing symbol 1 .",
    "we wish to show @xmath112 , where @xmath113 .",
    "( note that the transitivity and minimality of @xmath69 are then immediately implied by c1 . )",
    "if @xmath13 has only one cycle , say @xmath114 , then c1 implies @xmath115 .",
    "hence @xmath116 in this case .",
    "otherwise , by c2 there exists some cycle @xmath117 of @xmath13 such that the factors @xmath118 that meet @xmath119 occur contiguously in @xmath69 . by c1",
    "this means that for some @xmath120 we have @xmath121 and no factors of @xmath69 other than @xmath122 meet @xmath119 .",
