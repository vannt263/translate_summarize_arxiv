    "we will work up to the general question by first examining the special ( low ratings ) case when one candidate has at least as many votes as the other throughout the tally .",
    "this is the classical `` ballot problem '' , in which candidate e and candidate n are competing for a public office .",
    "candidate e wins the election with @xmath0 votes .",
    "how many ways are there to report the votes so that at all times during the tally n is not ahead of e ?",
    "we may represent the state of the tally at any moment by the pair @xmath1 , where the coordinates @xmath2 and @xmath3 count the votes received by e and n respectively .",
    "then a tally consists of a sequence of points on the integer lattice in the plane made in steps of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "such a sequence is called a _ northeast lattice",
    "path_.    we say that the lattice path @xmath6 is _ restricted _ by the lattice path @xmath7 if no part of @xmath6 lies directly above @xmath7 .",
    "for example , figure  [ restrictedpaths ] shows two northeast lattice paths from @xmath8 to @xmath9 that are restricted by the `` staircase '' @xmath10 , or , equivalently , that do not go above the line @xmath11 .",
    "the ballot problem asks for the number @xmath12 of these paths .",
    "( note that if the tally ends at @xmath13 , we may uniquely continue it to a northeast lattice path ending at @xmath9 . )",
    "[ restrictedpaths ]     to @xmath14 restricted by @xmath15 . ]",
    "the ballot problem can be solved by constructing a simple recurrence .",
    "let @xmath6 be a northeast lattice path restricted by the staircase @xmath7 .",
    "consider the point on @xmath6 where it first revisits the line @xmath16 , and let @xmath17 be the @xmath2-coordinate of this point .",
    "( this point exists since @xmath6 ends at @xmath9 . ) for the upper path in figure  [ restrictedpaths ] , @xmath18 ; for the lower path , @xmath19 .",
    "notice that since @xmath6 does not go above @xmath16 and begins at @xmath8 its first step is @xmath20 ; further , its last step before reaching the point @xmath21 is @xmath22 .",
    "therefore we may delete these steps to obtain a northeast lattice path from @xmath23 to @xmath24 that does not go above the line @xmath25 .",
    "there are @xmath26 ways to form such a path , and there are @xmath27 ways to continue this path from @xmath21 to @xmath9 , so we have that @xmath28 .",
    "this we recognize as the familiar recurrence satisfied by the catalan numbers @xmath29 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* exercise 6.19(h ) ) , so we simply check that the initial condition @xmath30 agrees .",
    "we now consider a generalization of the ballot problem .",
    "let @xmath31 be the number of northeast lattice paths restricted by an arbitrary northeast lattice path @xmath7 from @xmath8 to @xmath13 .",
    "the path @xmath7 represents the network s predetermined restrictions on the tally .",
    "it was known by macmahon @xcite that the sum of @xmath31 over all such paths is @xmath32 however , we are interested in computing @xmath31 for specific @xmath7 .",
    "first we develop notation for lattice paths .",
    "it is possible to represent a northeast lattice path as a word on @xmath33 , such as @xmath34 for the upper path in figure  [ restrictedpaths ] .",
    "however , this representation is redundant , because the location of each @xmath20 step determines the path uniquely .",
    "therefore , we may represent a northeast lattice path by the sequence of heights @xmath35 of the path along each interval from @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "for example , for the upper path in figure  [ restrictedpaths ] we have @xmath38 .",
    "this representation is always a nondecreasing tuple of integers , and it is our primary representation of lattice paths in this note .",
    "a lattice path @xmath39 is restricted by the lattice path @xmath40 precisely when @xmath41 componentwise , i.e. , @xmath42 whenever @xmath43 .    to write the main result",
    ", however , it turns out to be more natural to use still another representation of a northeast lattice path @xmath7  its difference sequence @xmath44 let @xmath45 .",
    "since @xmath7 is a northeast lattice path , the entries of @xmath46 are nonnegative integers .",
    "the entry @xmath47 is the number of @xmath22 steps taken along the line @xmath48 , so we can think of this representation as determining a path by the location of each @xmath22 step .",
    "the operator @xmath49 has an inverse @xmath50 , which produces the sequence of partial sums : @xmath51    the relationship between @xmath7 and @xmath52 can be interpreted in another way . if @xmath53 is a tuple of nonnegative integers , the pitman ",
    "stanley polytope @xcite defined by @xmath46 is @xmath54 thus a tuple @xmath55 of nonnegative integers is a lattice point inside @xmath56 precisely when the northeast lattice path @xmath57 is restricted by @xmath58 . in other words",
    ", @xmath49 provides a bijection from the northeast lattice paths restricted by @xmath7 to the lattice points in @xmath59 .",
    "we now return to the question at hand : how many northeast lattice paths are restricted by the path @xmath60 ?",
    "equivalently , how many lattice points lie inside @xmath59 ?",
    "one answer to this question is the following determinant enumeration .",
    "let @xmath61 be the @xmath62 matrix with entries @xmath63 .",
    "then the number of northeast lattice paths restricted by @xmath7 is @xmath64 , as given by kreweras @xcite and mohanty ( * ? ? ? * theorem 2.1 ) .",
    "this fact can be obtained from the triangular system of equations @xmath65 for @xmath66 ( where @xmath67 ) , which comes from an inclusion  exclusion argument ; solve for @xmath68 using cramer s rule , and in the numerator expand by minors along the last column .",
    "the following theorem presents a formula for @xmath31 in which the lattice points in @xmath69 play a central role .",
    "this gives a non - determinantal formula for the number of northeast lattice paths restricted by @xmath7 .",
    "a generalization of the formula has been independently discovered by gessel and by pitman and stanley ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation  ( 33 ) ) in more advanced contexts .",
    "our proof uses elementary combinatorial methods .",
    "let @xmath7 be a northeast lattice path from @xmath8 to @xmath13 , and let @xmath52 .",
    "the number of northeast lattice paths restricted by @xmath7 is @xmath70 where the sum is over all @xmath71 lattice points @xmath2 in @xmath69 .",
    "we immediately obtain two well - known results as special cases .",
    "for @xmath72 we see that @xmath73 , which gives @xmath74 since @xmath75 ( from the generalization of the binomial theorem @xmath76 to @xmath77 ) , the only nonzero terms in the sum come from lattice points of the form @xmath78 , and therefore @xmath79 as expected .    for @xmath80",
    "we recover the ballot problem .",
    "namely , @xmath81 , so @xmath82    equation  ( [ thm ] ) allows one to compute @xmath31 not only for explicit integer paths but for symbolic paths , and the resulting expressions have the pleasant property that they are written in the basis of rising factorials @xmath83 .",
    "for example , @xmath84 . for a general path of length @xmath85",
    ", we have @xmath86 and @xmath87 is @xmath88    putting equation  ( [ thm ] ) together with the determinantal formula for @xmath31 , we obtain a formula for a certain symbolic determinant in the same basis : @xmath89 where again @xmath52 .",
    "we note that amdeberhan and stanley ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 4.7 ) show that @xmath31 also gives the number of monomials in the expanded form of the multivariate polynomial @xmath90 in the variables @xmath91 .",
    "moreover , @xmath31 is the number of noncrossing matchings of a certain type ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 4.9 ) .",
    "let @xmath92 be the number of lattice points in @xmath56 , where @xmath93 .",
    "that is , @xmath94 . the following recurrence will be used .",
    "we have @xmath95    the only lattice point in @xmath96 is @xmath97 ; hence @xmath98 .    for @xmath99 , we partition the lattice points @xmath100 in @xmath56 according to the first entry @xmath101 .",
    "since @xmath100 is a lattice point in @xmath56 , then @xmath102 , so @xmath103 .",
    "therefore , lattice points @xmath104 in @xmath56 are in bijection ( by deleting the first entry @xmath105 ) with lattice points in @xmath106 .",
    "thus @xmath107 is the number of lattice points in @xmath56 with first entry @xmath105 , giving the recurrence .    to prove the theorem , then , it suffices to show that equation  ( [ thm ] ) satisfies this recurrence .",
    "the base case @xmath108 is easily checked , since the product is empty ; we have @xmath109 since again @xmath96 has only one lattice point .",
    "the remainder of this note is devoted to showing that for @xmath99 @xmath110 where the left sum is over all @xmath71 lattice points @xmath2 in @xmath69 and the right sum is over all @xmath111 lattice points @xmath3 in @xmath112 .",
    "we proceed by simplifying this equation until it becomes a statement about sums of binomial coefficients , given in the lemma below .",
    "first interchange the two summations on the right side of equation  ( [ rec ] ) .",
    "next , fix @xmath113 on the right side , and break up the sum on the left according to the choice of @xmath3 in the following way .",
    "the _ children _ of @xmath113 are the elements of the set @xmath114 for example , the children of the lattice point @xmath115 are @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and @xmath119 .",
    "it is immediate that each lattice point @xmath2 has a unique parent @xmath3 .",
    "this definition is central to the proof .",
    "the reason for defining children in this way is that @xmath2 is a lattice point in @xmath120 if and only if @xmath2 s parent is a lattice point in @xmath112 .",
    "this property provides a many - to - one correspondence between the @xmath0-dimensional lattice points in @xmath69 and the ( @xmath121)-dimensional lattice points in @xmath112 . using this correspondence to break up equation  ( [ rec ] ) ,",
    "we obtain @xmath122 for each @xmath3 , where the left sum is over all children @xmath123 of @xmath3 .",
    "it now suffices to prove equation  ( [ eq2 ] ) for a fixed @xmath3 , since summing both sides of equation  ( [ eq2 ] ) over all @xmath12 lattice points @xmath3 in @xmath112 produces equation  ( [ rec ] ) .",
    "note that if @xmath2 is a child of @xmath3 then @xmath124 for @xmath125 , so we may divide both sides of equation  ( [ eq2 ] ) by the product @xmath126 to obtain @xmath127    we know what the children of @xmath3 look like , so the sum on the left side can be written as @xmath128 the first term in this expression , which corresponds to the child @xmath129 of @xmath3 , is equal to the @xmath130 term on the right side of equation  ( [ eq3 ] ) . removing this term from both sides leaves",
    "@xmath131 which is proved in the following lemma under the substitution @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 .",
    "let @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath137 be nonnegative integers .",
    "then @xmath138    we show that both sides of the equation are equal to @xmath139    the right side is a telescoping sum : @xmath140    the result for the left side follows from a generalization of the vandermonde identity , namely @xmath141 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* problem 1.42(i ) ) .",
    "the summand on the left side of this equation counts the @xmath142-element subsets of @xmath143 whose @xmath144st element is @xmath145 by choosing @xmath146 of the first @xmath147 elements to be _ not _ in the set and @xmath148 of the last @xmath149 elements to be _ not _ in the set .",
    "the right side counts all @xmath142-element subsets of @xmath143 by selecting the elements _ not _ in the set .",
    "subtract @xmath150 from both sides of this equation and substitute @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 , and @xmath154 to obtain @xmath155    thus the director of programming may , for example , determine the likelihood that a random tally of votes will satisfy the network s needs .",
