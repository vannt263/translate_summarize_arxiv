    "the accretion process can occur onto the neutron star in the case of relatively slowly rotating objects even if the neutron stars are characterized by a super - strong surface magnetic field ( so called magnetars ) .",
    "up to now , magnetars have not been observed inside the binary systems .",
    "however , very recently it was claimed that x - ray emission characteristic for magnetars has been observed from the object lsi + 61 303 , which belongs to the rare class of massive binary systems emitting tev @xmath1-rays ( dubus & giebels  2008 ) . the observed outburst of thermal x - ray emission might be due to the transient accretion of matter onto the surface of the neutron star . moreover ,",
    "quasi - periodic x - ray emission , with the frequency of 0.2 hz , has been reported from the direction of this binary ( ray , hartman et al .",
    "whether this emission is in fact related to this massive binary , it is at present an open issue ( see rea & torres  2008 ) .",
    "however , if it is true , then it makes sense to speculate that the compact object inside the lsi + 61 303 is an accreting magnetar .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate such a hypothesis .",
    "we apply the general scenario for the @xmath1-ray production similar to that one recently proposed for accreting classical and millisecond neutron stars ( bednarek 2008 ) .",
    "it is shown that also accreting magnetars can accelerate electrons in the magnetized , turbulent region inside the ns magnetosphere when the gravitational pressure of the accreting matter is balanced by the magnetic pressure of the rotating ns magnetosphere .",
    "we calculate the high energy radiation produced in the synchrotron and inverse compton processes by primary electrons and secondary @xmath2 cascade pairs immersed in the magnetic fields of the magnetar and the massive star , and in the thermal radiation from the massive star surface .",
    "we consider a compact binary system containing rotating strongly magnetized neutron star ( magnetar ) and a massive companion of the o , b type star .",
    "it is assumed that a mass from the stellar wind is effectively captured by the strong gravitational potential of the neutron star ( ns ) .",
    "depending on its period and surface magnetic field , the accretion process onto ns can occur in different phases . according to the classification scheme of lipunov  ( 1992 )",
    ", the accretion process can occur in the phase of accretor ( for relatively slow rotators ) or in the phase of propeller .",
    "the accretor phase in the case of classical and millisecond pulsars has been recently discussed by bednarek  ( 2008 ) . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the propeller phase for the strongly magnetized neutron stars , i.e. magnetars . in this case",
    ", the matter from the stellar wind can penetrate below the light cylinder radius of the rotating ns magnetosphere .",
    "this matter extracts rotational energy from the ns as a result of interaction of the free falling matter with the rigidly rotating inner ns magnetosphere . as a result of this interaction , a very turbulent and magnetized transition region",
    "is formed .",
    "we consider possible acceleration of electrons in such a medium .",
    "the distance at which the magnetic field starts to dominate the dynamics of the in - falling matter ( the alfven radius ) can be estimated by comparing the magnetic field energy density with the kinetic energy density of the wind ,    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the magnetic field in the inner neutron star magnetosphere , @xmath5 is the density of the accreting matter , @xmath6 is the free fall velocity of the accreting matter , @xmath7 is the alfven radius , and g is the gravitational constant .",
    "the matter in this transition region is very turbulent and strongly magnetized providing good conditions for acceleration of particles to high energies .",
    "let us estimate the location of this region from the surface of the neutron star . by applying eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] , and assuming that the magnetic field in the neutron star magnetosphere is of the dipole type , i.e. @xmath8 , we obtain @xmath9 where the magnetic field at the neutron star surface is @xmath10 g and the accretion rate is @xmath11 g s@xmath12 ( see also baan & treves  1973 ) .",
    "then , we can estimate the magnetic field strength at the transition region , @xmath13 the accretion according to the propeller scenario can occur provided that some conditions are fulfilled . at first",
    ", the radius of the transition region has to lay inside the light cylinder radius of the neutron star , i.e",
    "@xmath14 , where @xmath15 s is the rotational period of the neutron star , and @xmath16 is the velocity of light .",
    "the above condition is fulfilled when , @xmath17 at second , the rotational velocity of the magnetosphere at @xmath7 has to be longer than the keplerian velocity of the accreting matter .",
    "the rotational velocity , @xmath18 is larger than the keplerian velocity , @xmath19 for the ns with the rotation periods , @xmath20 this last condition on the ns period separates the propeller phase ( lower periods ) from the accretor phase ( larger periods ) .",
    "the third condition relates the alfven radius , @xmath7 , to the capturing radius of the matter from the stellar wind by the ns .",
    "it is determined by the balance between the kinetic energy of wind with its potential energy in the gravitational field of the ns , @xmath21 where @xmath22 cm s@xmath12 is the velocity of the surrounding matter measured in respect to the ns .",
    "the accretion from the stellar wind occurs when @xmath23 , which happens for , @xmath24 this condition is not restrictive even for magnetars in the case of the accretion rates considered below .    in the conditions expected for the transition region ( strongly magnetized and very turbulent medium )",
    ", particles should be efficiently accelerated . in this paper",
    "we consider only acceleration of electrons .",
    "the acceleration rate of electrons with energy @xmath25 ( and the lorentz factor @xmath1 ) can be parametrized by , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the acceleration parameter , @xmath16 the velocity of light , @xmath28 the larmor radius , and @xmath29 electron charge . during the acceleration process electrons",
    "suffer energy losses mainly on the synchrotron process and on the inverse compton scattering of radiation from the massive star .",
    "electrons lose energy on ic process in the thomson ( t ) and the klein - nishina ( kn ) regimes .",
    "let us estimate the photon energy densities from the massive star ( @xmath30 ) in the location of the ns , @xmath31 where",
    "@xmath32 k and @xmath33 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , and @xmath34 is the distance of the ns from the massive star .",
    "let us also estimate the energy density of the magnetic field at the transition region ( see eq .  [ eq3 ] ) , @xmath35 the energy losses for each process ( synchrotron and ic in the t regime ) can be calculated from , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the thomson cross section .",
    "the energy losses of electrons at large energies are dominated by the synchrotron process since the ic losses in the radiation field of the massive star decline due to the klein - nishina cross section .",
    "therefore , the maximum energies of accelerated electrons are determined by the balance between energy gains ( eq .  [ eq10 ] ) and energy losses on synchrotron process ( eq .  [ eq13 ] ) .",
    "they can be expressed by , @xmath38 it is clear that for the realistic parameters of the model electrons can reach tev energies .",
    "the maximum power available for acceleration of electrons is limited by the energy extracted from the rotating neutron star by the in - falling matter .",
    "this matter from the stellar wind is accelerated to the velocity of the magnetic field lines at @xmath7 .",
    "the power which has to be transfered from the rotating ns to the matter can be estimated from @xmath39 by using eq .",
    "[ eq4 ] , we can estimate the maximum power which can be extracted in terms of such a model in the propeller stage , @xmath40 a part of this maximum possible power , @xmath41 , can go on acceleration of electrons .",
    "the total rotational energy of the magnetar is , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the angular momentum of inertia of rotating ns calculated for its mass equal to 1.4@xmath44 and the radius of 10 km , and @xmath45 is its angular velocity .",
    "this energy reservoir is enough to provide sufficient power to the accreting matter for a time of the order of thousand of years .",
    "note that a neutron star in a specific binary system can come through the cycles of rotational energy losses ( during the propeller phase ) and energy gains ( during the accretor phase ) .",
    "these phases depend on the accretion rate from the massive star which can change due to the stellar variability or evolution .",
    "so then , the angular velocity of magnetars may also increase at some periods as in the case of millisecond pulsars .    for the known parameters of the binary system",
    ", we can estimate the accretion rate onto the magnetar , @xmath46 where the capturing radius is given by eq .",
    "[ eq8 ] , @xmath47 cm is the separation of the stars inside binary system , @xmath48 m@xmath49 yr@xmath12 is the mass loss rate of the massive star , and @xmath22 denotes the wind velocity and/or the ns velocity on its orbit around the massive star @xmath50 . for the luminous stars ,",
    "the wind velocity , of the order of @xmath51 km s@xmath12 , is usually larger than the ns velocity .",
    "the b type stars , present inside the tev @xmath1-ray binaries , have typical mass loss rate in the range @xmath52 m@xmath49 yr@xmath12 and stellar wind velocities @xmath53 km s@xmath12",
    ". then , the typical accretion rates onto the ns are in the range @xmath54 g s@xmath12 , for the separation of the companion stars below 10 radii of the massive star .",
    "in this model , radiation is produced by electrons in the synchrotron and ic process .",
    "we assume that primary electrons in the transition region reach the power law spectrum , @xmath55 up to @xmath56 .",
    "the energy losses of electrons are dominated at the highest energies ( close to @xmath57 ) by the synchrotron process occurring in the magnetic field of the transition region .",
    "the @xmath1-ray production at these highest energies in the ic scattering of thermal radiation from the massive star occurs typically at a lower rate than the synchrotron process but at lower energies ic process can dominate .",
    "the ic @xmath1-rays have large enough energies that in some cases they can initiate ic @xmath2 pair cascades in the radiation of the massive star .",
    "such cascade can develop provided that the optical depths for electrons in the anisotropic radiation of the massive star are large enough .",
    "these optical depths have been calculated in the most general case of the anisotropic radiation of the massive star by e.g. bednarek  ( 1997 , 2000 ) .",
    "they can be easily scaled for the case of the massive star with the arbitrary parameters ( see bednarek  2008 ) .",
    "we developed the monte carlo code which is able to calculate the synchrotron radiation from the primary electrons ( magnetic field of the transition region ) , the secondary cascade @xmath2 pairs ( in the magnetic field of the massive star ) , and the @xmath1-ray spectra produced in ic @xmath2 pair cascade occurring in the anisotropic radiation of the massive star .",
    "this code base on the earlier code discussed for the binary systems ( e.g. bednarek  2000 ) . in order to calculate the synchrotron spectrum produced by @xmath2 pairs inside the volume of the binary system",
    ", we have to define the distribution of the magnetic field around the massive star .",
    "the strength of the magnetic field as a function of distance from the center of the massive star can be described by the following equations ( usov & melrose , 1992 ) , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the surface magnetic field of the massive star , @xmath60 is the alfven radius within the massive star wind which can be derived by solving the equation , @xmath61 .",
    "it has simple approximate solution , @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 is the mass loss rate , and @xmath65 is the stellar wind velocity .",
    "this approximation for the magnetic field structure is satisfactory inside the most important part of the binary system ( i.e. within @xmath66 ) for the stars which typical rotation velocity is lower than @xmath67 of their wind velocity .",
    "note that the larger values of the surface magnetic field of the massive star do not necessary mean larger values of the magnetic field at some distance from the stellar surface ( as would be expected from the simple analysis of eq .",
    "[ eq19 ] ) since b(r ) depends also on the alfven radius which in turn depends on the surface magnetic field and the mass loss rate of the massive star .",
    "as an example , we apply the model for the massive binary system lsi + 61 303 which has been discovered as a tev @xmath1-ray source by the magic collaboration ( albert et al .  2006 ) and confirmed by the veritas collaboration ( acciari et al .",

    "12.2truecm    the distances of the periastron passage , @xmath75 , for both models are very similar ( table 1 ) , but distances of the apoastron passage , @xmath76 , differ significantly .",
    "this can explain the stronger absorption features in the case of the ic cascade spectrum at the apoastron in the case of parameters proposed by grundstrom et al .",
    ". however the steeper cascade ic spectra obtained at the periastron for the casares et al .",
    "( 2005 ) parameters has to be related to the differences in the angle of the periastron passage in respect to the location of the observer .",
    "note , that in most of the considered cases ( e.g. figures a , c , e , f ) , the gev @xmath1-ray fluxes does not change drastically between the periastron and apoastron passages .",
    "therefore , it is likely that observed strong modulation of the tev @xmath1-ray emission with the period of the binary system may not be observed by the _",
    "lat detector in the gev energies .",
    "the synchrotron spectra have more complicated shape due two the components produced by primary electrons and secondary @xmath2 pairs .",
    "the strength of the component produced by secondary @xmath2 pairs strongly depends on the surface magnetic field of the massive star , @xmath59 , and on the distribution of the magnetic field around the star . in general , for stronger @xmath59 , the synchrotron spectrum from secondary @xmath2 pairs is stronger ( see dashed curves in fig .  [ fig1 ] ) , reaching saturation for @xmath84 g. at the apoastron passage , the second synchrotron bump becomes comparable to the first bump only for the largest considered values of the surface magnetic field of the massive star , i.e. @xmath85 g.    note that a part of primary electrons can likely escape from the transition region with the matter which can be expelled along the rotational axis of the magnetar , i.e. within the possible transient jet which is sometimes expected in the case of the accretion process occurring in the propeller regime .",
    "the synchrotron emission of these electrons in the jet is not taken into account in this calculations .    in this simple model , the conversion coefficient of energy from the transition region to relativistic electrons , @xmath41 ,",
    "is kept independent on the phase of the binary system .",
    "however , @xmath41 may also depend on the accretion rate ( i.e. a distance between the stars ) in the way which is at present unknown .",
    "therefore , any absolute normalization of the spectra is problematic since it may vary with the phase of the binary system , e.g. as observed in the hard x - rays ( chernyakova et al .",
    "only detailed phase dependent multi - wavelength observations can put constraints on the injection details of electrons at different phases of the binary system .",
    "we show that strongly magnetized , accreting neutron stars ( magnetars ) close to the massive stars inside the binary systems can be responsible for the acceleration of electrons up to tev energies .",
    "these electrons interact with the magnetic field of the inner magnetosphere of the magnetar and with the soft radiation field from the massive companion producing x - rays ( synchrotron process ) and @xmath1-rays ( inverse compton process ) .",
    "a part of injected @xmath1-rays can be absorbed in the radiation of massive star developing ic @xmath2 pair cascade .",
    "secondary @xmath2 pairs lose significant part of their energy on the synchrotron emission",
    ". the @xmath1-ray spectra produced in such scenario can extend up to tev energies and the synchrotron spectra can extend up to mev energies .",
    "the processes discussed above concern to a specific stage in the evolution of the binary system , when the accretion rate onto the neutron star is at the range which guarantee the propeller phase . in fact , this phase may be short lived due to the variable wind from the massive star .",
    "when the accretion rate is different , the magnetar can move to the ejector or the accretor phase during which different scenarios should be considered .",
    "for example in the accretor phase the magnetar can gain angular momentum with the accreting matter and decrease its rotational period as expected in the case of the millisecond pulsars .",
    "we expect ( based on the comparison of eq .",
    "[ eq16 ] and  [ eq17 ] ) that the propeller phase of the accretion onto the neutron star , in which observable fluxes of @xmath1-rays can be detected , is relatively short lived .",
    "this may explain a small number of massive binaries discovered up to now in the tev @xmath1-rays .",
    "applying the parameters of the binary system lsi + 61 303 , we show that such a model can explain the tev @xmath1-ray emission observed close to the apoastron passage of the neutron star .",
    "the lack of observable tev emission from the parts of the orbit close to the periastron is due to the inefficient acceleration of electrons and the suppression of the tev @xmath1-rays in the ic @xmath2 cascade process in which also the synchrotron energy losses play an important role .",
