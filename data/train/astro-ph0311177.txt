    "observations of the abundance of deuterium relative to hydrogen ( d / h ) in different environments provide insight into the evolution of the light elements in the universe . with the excellent concordance in the estimates of the cosmic baryon density from measurements of d / h in low - metallicity quasar absorption - line systems and measurements of the cosmic microwave background , the cosmic baryon density and the primordial value of d / h",
    "are now tightly constrained ( burles , nolett , & turner 2001 ; omeara et al.2001 ; spergel et al .  2003 ) .",
    "thus , it should be possible to test chemical evolution models by examining the progression of d / h with time ( see lemoine et al .  1999 and olive , steigman , & walker 2000 for recent discussions ) .",
    "the abundance of deuterium is expected to decrease with time since there are no known sources of deuterium capable of increasing the cosmic abundance significantly ( epstein , lattimer , & schramm 1976 ; see also prodanovi & fields 2003 ) .",
    "many chemical evolution models predict moderate levels of deuterium destruction by stellar nucleosynthesis , typically less than a factor of 35 ( clayton 1985 ; edmunds 1994 ; steigman & tosi 1995 ; tosi et al .",
    "more recent models suggest that slightly lower levels of astration are also possible ( e.g. , chiappini , renda , & matteucci 2002 ) .",
    "unfortunately , measurements of d / h are particularly difficult , and there have been relatively few opportunities to directly measure the detailed changes in the abundance of deuterium as a function of metallicity or time .",
    "a key piece of information missing in discussions of the evolution of the light element abundances with time is the behavior of d / h in environments with metallicities between those of the high - redshift systems ( typically @xmath13 ) and those of gas in the local neighborhood of the sun ( typically @xmath14 ) .",
    "there are several reasons why it it is important to determine the d / h ratio in a wide variety of galactic and extragalactic environments .",
    "first , there have been few high - precision estimates of d / h at moderate to high redshifts ( @xmath15 ) , where the amount of stellar processing of deuterium is presumably low , as evidenced by low metallicity ( e.g. , omeara et al.2001 ; pettini & bowen 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "the measurements that have been made appear to yield conflicting values for the primordial abundance of deuterium , with the observed values depending on the type of system observed ( e.g. , lyman - limit or damped ly@xmath16 systems  see pettini & bowen 2001 ) .",
    "second , estimates of d / h in many locations yield a more global perspective of the chemical history of gas at different epochs than is possible from a few isolated measurements .",
    "chemical evolution models seeking to describe the general evolution of the light - element abundances need a large sample of measurements to avoid systematic problems encountered by relying upon data for only a few types of environments .",
    "third , although measurements of deuterium in nearby gas clouds imply a relatively constant value of d / h within the local interstellar medium ( ism ; moos et al .",
    "2002 and references therein ) , substantial variations may exist in d / h and d / o over distances of only a few hundred parsecs ( jenkins et al .",
    "1999 ; sonneborn et al .",
    "2000 ; hoopes et al .  2003",
    "; hbrard & moos 2003 ) .",
    "if a sufficiently large number of high - precision d / h and d / o measurements can be made in a diverse set of nearby environments , it may be possible to understand the exact causes of this variability and the degree to which galactic chemical evolution and accretion of intragroup gas clouds influence the scatter in the observed ratios , both locally and at high redshift .",
    "this goal is a major science driver for the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( fuse ) mission ( moos et al .",
    "2000 ) .    to bridge the gap in d / h between low and high metallicity environments , we have obtained an extensive set of fuse ,",

    "unlike previous investigations of d / h and d / o in either high - redshift clouds or the local ism , we know which gaseous system is responsible for the high - velocity lyman - series absorption observed toward pg1259 + 593 .",
    "a global description of the gas in complex  c is available from both emission and absorption - line measurements .",
    "the neutral gas in complex  c has been mapped extensively in 21 cm emission ( see wakker 2001 and references therein ) and low - ionization absorption ( e.g. , wakker et al .  1999 ; richter et al .",
    "2001b ; collins , shull , & giroux 2003 ) .",

    "complex  c is an excellent site to determine d / h for comparisons with the high - redshift values because it is chemically young ( richter et al .",

    "we summarize the results of the study in  10 .",
    "we observed pg1259 + 593 on nine occasions with fuse between 2000  february  25 and 2001  march  28 for a total ( orbital day + night ) integration time of @xmath17 kiloseconds ( ks ) spread over 236 individual exposures .",
    "approximately 350 ks of data were obtained during orbital night .",
    "an observation log for the nine visits is provided in table  1 .",
    "data were obtained through the large ( lwrs ; @xmath18 ) apertures in all four fuse channels ( lif1 , lif2 , sic1 , sic2 ) with varying degrees of success .",
    "pg1259 + 593 was always well - centered in the lwrs aperture of the lif1 channel used for guiding , but thermal effects caused the light of pg1259 + 593 to drift around inside ( and at times even partially outside ) the remaining three apertures .",
    "detector high voltages were also at reduced levels during some of the exposures as a result of operational difficulties ( see table  1 notes ) .",
    "we obtained all of the data in time - tagged photon - address mode to allow for data screening and time - dependent corrections necessary to fully calibrate the data .",
    "the raw fuse data for pg1259 + 593 can be found in the multi - mission archive at the space telescope science institute under the observation identifications p1080101p1080109 .",
    "we processed the data with a customized version of the fuse pipeline software ( calfuse v2.2.2 ) , which is publicly available from the fuse project at the johns hopkins university .",
    "the details of this processing follow the same general principles outlined by sembach et al .",
    "( 2001b ) . however , since pg1259 + 593 is a faint object ( @xmath19 erg @xmath4 s@xmath2 @xmath2 between 920 and 1200 ) , we modified these procedures in the following manner to process the data . first , we screened the raw photon lists in every exposure for earth limb avoidance , south atlantic anomaly passage , pulse height distribution constraints , and particle event bursts ( see sahnow et al .",
    "we chose the pulse height restrictions after inspection of the pulse height profiles to reduce background events while minimizing the number of source events discarded ; pulse height data numbers from 4 to 24 were allowed .",
    "event bursts were common in these observations , particularly those obtained in the march 2001 time period , so we carefully checked the cleaned lists to be sure that no obvious signal from these events remained after screening .",
    "next , we combined the screened exposure lists for each channel within each observation using the default spectral registration provided by the software .",
    "this default assumption is necessary since there is not enough signal in the individual exposures to reliably cross - correlate the positions of narrow spectral features ; the typical exposure time of @xmath20 ks per exposure yielded an average of @xmath20 counts per resolution element in the highest sensitivity ( lif1 ) channel and @xmath21 counts per resolution element in the sic channels .",
    "the summed channel lists for each observation were corrected for geometric distortions , doppler shifts , thermally - induced grating motions , astigmatism , detector backgrounds , and scattered light following the standard procedures ( sahnow et al .",
    "the extracted spectra for each channel in each observation were then flux calibrated and wavelength calibrated .",
    "we registered the spectra from each of the nine observations to a common wavelength scale by noting the integral pixel shifts required to align the same narrow absorption features observed in each spectrum .",
    "these shifts were typically less than 3 detector fuse pixels and always less than 15 pixels .",
    "we then co - added the aligned spectra for all 9 observations to produce a final composite spectrum for each channel .",
    "we registered the composite channel spectra to a common heliocentric wavelength scale by performing a channel - to - channel registration similar to that performed at the observation level and then setting the zero point of the wavelength scale to that provided by the stis spectra ( discussed below ) .",
    "for the fuse - to - stis registration , we compared the velocities of lines of the same species observed by each instrument ( e.g. , @xmath22 ; @xmath23 ; @xmath24 ) . the and comparisons used lines with approximately the same line strengths , @xmath25 , to ensure that the comparisons were not influenced by asymmetric profiles that saturate in one line but not the other .",
    "additional checks were performed using cross - element comparisons ( e.g. , @xmath26 with @xmath27 , etc . ) .",
    "we then corrected the fuse spectra to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) reference frame .",
    "for the pg1259 + 593 sight line , the correction for standard solar motion @xmath28 kms@xmath2 , assuming a solar speed of 19.5 kms@xmath2  in the direction @xmath29 , @xmath30 ( delhaye 1965 ; lang 1980 ; see also kerr & lynden - bell 1986 ) .",
    "this correction is within @xmath31 kms@xmath2  of the lsr reduction based on a solar speed of 16.5 kms@xmath2  in the direction @xmath32 ( mihalas & binney 1981 ) . unless stated otherwise , all velocities quoted in this paper are in the lsr reference frame .",
    "the fuse spectra for pg1259 + 593 have a nominal zero - point velocity uncertainty of @xmath33 kms@xmath2  ( @xmath34 ) after these calibrations have been applied .",
    "the fuse data are oversampled in the spectral domain . therefore , after calibration we binned the spectra to a spectral bin size of 4 pixels , or @xmath35  ( @xmath36 kms@xmath2 ) .",
    "this binning provides approximately 3 samples per spectral resolution element of 2225 kms@xmath2 .",
    "the night - only data used in this study have continuum signal - to - noise ratios @xmath37 and 16 per spectral resolution element at 1030in the lif1 and lif2 channels , respectively , and @xmath38 and 12 at 950  in the sic1 and sic2 channels , respectively .",
    "the version of calfuse ( v2.2.2 ) used for this study has significant improvements over earlier versions used in previous studies , most notably improved wavelength solutions and background corrections tailored for day+night or night - only extractions .",
    "portions of the fully reduced night - only sic2 and sic1 spectra in the 915955   wavelength range are shown in figure  1 .",
    "the locations of the lyman series and lines are indicated in the top panel along with the locations of prominent interstellar and lines .",
    "terrestrial airglow emission features , which are present in all of the lines observed , are marked below the top spectrum with crossed circle symbols .",
    "terrestrial and emissions are undetectable in the night - only data shown . the background subtraction for both channels results in nearly zero residual flux in the cores of the lines as expected , except at velocities affected by airglow contamination .",
    "( a similar conclusion holds for the very strong @xmath39 line observed in all four channels . ) the slight rise in the sub - lyman - limit regime ( @xmath40 ) in the sic1 channel may be the result of the radiative recombination continuum emission from atomic oxygen near 911  ( see feldman et al .",
    "1992 ; lpez - moreno et al .",
    "2001 ) or improper background subtraction at these very short wavelengths .",
    "the sic2 channel extends only to 916.6 , so no independent check of the sic1 behavior at @xmath41  is possible .",
    "in the discussions that follow , we restrict our analysis to the orbital night - only data to minimize the impact of terrestrial and airglow emissions on the absorption lines of interest in this study .",
    "in particular , we concentrate on data from the two sic channels covering the fuse bandpass below 1000 , but we also use the independent data from the two lif channels to check the quality of the data at longer wavelengths .",
    "the checks allowed by multiple channel observations of the same spectral region are important for assessing noise in the data .",
    "when we derive h , d , and o abundances , we use both the sic1 and sic2 data .",

    "the leiden - dwingeloo survey ( lds , hartmann & burton 1997 ) shows that this core has an extent of about @xmath47 at a column density of @xmath48 @xmath4 , with pg1259 + 593 lying at its edge . to determine a more accurate estimate of the amount of high velocity in this region of the sky , we observed ciii with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) . since this interferometer filters out the large - scale structure , we supplemented the wsrt data in the direction of pg1259 + 593 with an effelsberg single - dish observation having a 97 beam .",

    "next , a map of the continuum was created for each pointing by adding the channels without emission .",
    "after subtracting the continuum , the individual pointings were cleaned using the multi - resolution clean algorithm ( wakker & schwarz 1988 ) . to increase the accuracy of this step ,",

    "see sembach et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and wakker et al .",

    "it is also more complex than the high - redshift sight lines , which can be selected for simple intergalactic absorption velocity structure and typically contain one or two predominant absorption components ( e.g. , omeara et al .",
    "the velocity structure of the pg1259 + 593 sight line does not allow for a precise measure of the column density in complex  c solely through analysis of the lyman - series absorption due to blending of the high velocity absorption with the ism and iv  arch components .",

    "it is also possible to draw upon the information in the absorption profiles for the sight line and to constrain the range of possible lyman - series absorption parameters for both and .",
    "our adopted method for determining the d / h and d / o ratios in complex  c can be broken down into several key steps : 1 )  determination of an accurate column density for complex  c and a model for the velocity structure of the neutral gas along the pg1259 + 593 sight line using the numerous absorption lines in the fuse and stis spectra , 2 )  application of the velocity model to the lyman - series lines in the fuse data to create an model that reproduces the observed absorption and 21 cm emission profiles , 3 )  determination of the column density in complex  c from the interferometric 21 cm data described in  2.3 , 4 )  determination of the amount of required to account for the complex  c absorption in the negative velocity wings of the lyman - series lines , and 5 )  consideration of the uncertainties associated with steps ( 1 )  ( 4 ) .",

    "the attributes of these components will be discussed for each species in  ",
    "a standard f - test indicates that adding additional components does not significantly improve the quality of the fit to the observed data , with the possible exception of an additional weak absorption feature discussed in  7.1 .",
    "adopting fewer components does not provide an acceptable fit to both the and absorption - line data .",
    "some of the identified components , especially those at low velocities , are likely to consist of multiple sub - components that can not be resolved at the resolution of the fuse and hst / stis data .",

    "2002 ) , the pg1259 + 593 sight line contains a variety of absorbing regions with a range of physical properties . linking the velocity structure directly to the profile shapes of species that trace both neutral and ionized gas could result in an inferred velocity extent of the neutral complex  c absorption that is sensitive to the profile shapes of singly ionized species in complex  c or in the iv  arch gas at nearby velocities .",
    "a secondary concern with tying the velocity structure of to ions such as or is the inclusion of refractory elements into dust .",
    "differential depletion of elements into dust grains or selective shock - disruption of grains can alter the relative gas - phase abundances of ism clouds encountered along the sight line , which in turn can translate into different absorption - line velocity structures for different species .",
    "we use all of the information available to construct an initial guess at the velocity structure of the sight line , but take the conservative approach of coupling the velocity structure of only those species ( i.e. , , , ) for which ionization and dust depletion effects are unlikely to differ significantly .",

    "we assume that the fuse line spread function ( lsf ) has a gaussian shape and a constant width ( fwhm ) of 0.075  ( @xmath88 fuse detector pixels ) throughout the fuse bandpass .",
    "this width corresponds to a velocity width of fwhm @xmath89 kms@xmath2 , depending upon wavelength .",
    "this is slightly broader than the nominal value of 20 kms@xmath2often assumed in fuse studies ( see sahnow et al .",
    "it is reasonable to expect the lsf for the combined pg1259 + 593 data to be degraded slightly compared to the nominal lsf for single fuse exposures because the number of individual exposures in the combined set of observations is large and registration of the individual exposures is certain to introduce some minor spectral degradation , particularly in the sic channels .",
    "given the velocity structure of the sight line , it is difficult to find narrow isolated lines to determine the lsf width directly .",
    "the narrowest lines for which this is possible in the fuse spectrum of pg1259 + 593 have observed ( instrumentally convolved ) widths of @xmath90  ( lif1a detector segment ) and @xmath91  ( sic2a detector segment ) .",
    "the measured widths are broader than the adopted lsf width but are consistent with the expected line widths based on the velocity structure observable at higher resolution in the stis data shown in figure  2 .    in previous investigations of d / h along kinematically simple sight lines ,",
    "a multiple - component lsf has sometimes been used to fit the data .",
    "for example , kruk et al . ( 2002 ) and wood et al . (",
    "2002 ) used a two - component lsf with a narrow component ( fwhm = 9 pixels ) containing @xmath92% of the total lsf area and a broad component ( fwhm @xmath93 pixels ) containing @xmath94% of the lsf area .",
    "when summed , the double - gaussian functions studied have a roughly gaussian shape with a width similar to that adopted in this study .",
    "the resulting column densities of and obtained with a double - component lsf have been similar to those obtained with single - component lsfs ( kruk et al .",
    "2002 ; wood et al .",
    "the reasons for this are straight - forward : the nearby absorption is simple , and the effects of a broad lsf component are most pronounced for strongly saturated lines requiring very accurate estimates of the optical depth at low residual flux levels . toward pg1259 + 593 ,",
    "the velocity structure is much more complex .",
    "since we must consider the case where weak absorption is in close proximity to strong absorption , it is not so easy to dismiss the effects of a non - gaussian lsf . for our pg1259 + 593 fuse dataset , which is the combination of many individual exposures",
    ", the central - limit theorem implies that the lsf of the combined data should also closely represent a single gaussian function . after modeling the sight line and considering the impact of a more complex lsf",
    ", we find that the addition of a second lsf component with broad wings does not change our estimates of the , , and line strengths .",
    "other systematic uncertainties dominate the potential uncertainties caused by the adoption of a single - component lsf rather than a two - component lsf of the type used in previous fuse studies .",
    "we performed a consistency check on our lsf estimation by comparing the shape of the @xmath95 line in the fuse lif2a spectrum with that of the @xmath96 line in the hst / stis spectrum .",
    "the two lines have intrinsic strengths ( @xmath25 ) within @xmath97 of each other , so direct comparisons of the velocity structure and component absorption depths could be made by relating the fuse spectrum to various smoothed versions of the higher resolution stis spectrum .",
    "we found that a good approximation to the fuse profile was obtained by convolving the stis spectrum with a gaussian function having fwhm @xmath98 kms@xmath2 .",
    "( at 1145 , our adopted instrumental width of 0.075  corresponds to fwhm = 19.6 kms@xmath2 . )",
    "smaller smoothing widths left structure in the smoothed stis spectrum that was not obvious in the fuse data , while larger smoothing widths underestimated the line depths and overestimated the line widths of the fuse absorption .",
    "this comparison does not reveal the exact shape of the fuse lsf , but it is sufficient to bracket the lsf width and demonstrate that the adopted gaussian lsf width is well - constrained .",
    "another simplifying assumption we make is that there are no undulations in the ultraviolet continuum of pg1259 + 593 on scales of less than a few ngstroms .",
    "this assumption is made in essentially all studies of quasar absorption line spectra .",
    "compared to the spectra of normal and degenerate hot stars , power - law quasar continua are exceedingly smooth over small wavelength intervals ; see , for example , the fuse spectrum of the quasar 3c273 ( sembach et al .",
    "the pg1259 + 593 spectrum contains no signatures of a stellar population contribution to the continuum light , which can be difficult to model for some agns , particularly type  ii seyferts .",

    "an additional incentive for determining the velocity structure is that some of the lines overlap the and lines ( see figure  1 ) .",

    "the resulting spectrum was subtracted from the effelsberg spectrum , and the full - resolution wsrt data were added back in . to each of these spectra we fit a single gaussian emission feature to estimate the column density in complex  c. figure  7 shows the results of these procedures . from the fit shown in the figure , we estimate n ( ) = @xmath183 @xmath4 in complex  c in the direction of pg1259 + 593 .",
    "the single - component fit to the complex  c emission has fwhm = @xmath184 kms@xmath2  ( b = @xmath185 kms@xmath2 ) . a straight integration of the profile from 145 to 109 kms@xmath2  yields n ( ) = @xmath186 @xmath4 , where the statistical error in this case is given by propagating the rms noise per channel ( 0.32 jy beam@xmath2 ) over 28 channels of width 1.288 kms@xmath2  per channel .",
    "note that n ( ) is nearly identical to that derived from the effelsberg data because n()@xmath187 n()@xmath188 . the higher resolution wsrt data reveal that the profile is about 20% narrower than previously measured , showing that some of the width of the single - dish profile is due to a small velocity gradient in the 97 effelsberg single - dish beam .",
    "sources of systematic errors associated with our determination of n ( ) in complex  c include cleaning and calibration of the data , scaling of the single - dish data , the shape of the single - dish beam , the `` negative bowl '' in the interferometer maps , and the fine - scale structure within the beam .",
    "adding the uncertainties associated with the first four of these errors together yields an `` instrumental '' systematic error of @xmath189 @xmath4 if all act in the same sense ; this uncertainty is comparable to the statistical error quoted above . although the wsrt data are not able to provide information about gas structures on scales smaller than the 1  effective beam size ( @xmath190 pc at a distance of 5 kpc ) , it is possible to assess the magnitude of the uncertainties caused by fine structure .",
    "we calculated the fluctuations in the column density in box sizes of @xmath191 pixels ( @xmath192 ) , @xmath193 pixels ( @xmath194 ) , and @xmath195 pixels ( @xmath196 ) .",

    "some of these small - scale structure effects are already covered indirectly in the `` instrumental '' systematic error estimate , but we note that there could still be additional uncertainties contributed by fluctuations at small scales that we can not assess . a total systematic error of @xmath202 @xmath4 accounts for most of the systematic errors listed above , including small - scale structure within the @xmath191 pixel box , even if the majority of these uncertainties affect the column density measurement in the same sense .",
    "we adopt this value as our 95% confidence uncertainty on the systematic error , and a value of @xmath203 @xmath4 as our 68% confidence uncertainty .    adding the corresponding systematic and statistical errors in quadrature to produce a total error yields a final column density estimate based on the 21 cm emission data of    n ( ) = @xmath3 @xmath4 ( 68% confidence ) + n ( ) = @xmath204 @xmath4 ( 95% confidence ) .",
    "we adopt this column density and its associated errors in our discussion of the lyman - series profiles , and we use the 21 cm data as a constraint on the velocity structure of the neutral gas along the sight line .",
    "other sight lines show higher velocity 21 cm emission in complex  c than the pg1259 + 593 sight line ( e.g. , the mrk  876 sight line ; murphy et al.2000 ) .",

    "n side - lobe - cleaned 21 cm spectra shown in figure  2 from the nrao 140-foot telescope ( murphy , sembach , & lockman , private communication ) . these data set a more stringent constraint on the amount of very high velocity gas than either the wsrt or effelsberg data .",
    "a limit on the amount of that could be present at very high velocities can also be set by the lack of absorption in the @xmath75 and @xmath76 profiles .",
    "we find 3@xmath139 equivalent width limits of 30m  for both lines over this 100 kms@xmath2  velocity interval .",

    "unfortunately , neither the 21 cm emission nor the metal - line absorption provide strict enough limits to rule out the possibility that some of the absorption attributed to may be high - velocity , low - density ( see  7.1 ) .",
    "while it is not possible to distinguish between and interloping in the lyman - series lines observed by fuse , an estimate of the amount of neutral gas at high positive velocities can be made .",
    "the lack of absorption at @xmath214 kms@xmath2  in the ly@xmath215 line sets a limit of log  n ( ) @xmath216 @xmath217 on high positive velocity gas along this sight line .",

    "an important step in our estimation of the deuterium abundance and the d / h ratio in complex  c is the conversion of the velocity structure into the velocity structure .",
    "once this conversion is completed , the d / h ratio in the complex  c components can be estimated by minimizing the residual absorption in the negative velocity wings of the lyman - series lines . to provide the most accurate velocity structure determination",
    ", we placed several constraints on the model profiles constructed with the template , as follows :    1 .",
    "we required that the column densities of the three principal component groups ( complex  c , iv  arch , and ism ) have total column densities determined from the 21 cm emission data .",
    "the column density of a fourth component group , the positive ivc , was calculated from n ( ) assuming a solar abundance of oxygen .",
    "these column densities are summarized in table  6 . within these component groups",
    ", we distributed the column densities in the proportions derived for the components ( see table  4 ) .",
    "for example , in complex  c , we required that the 127.4 kms@xmath2  component contain @xmath220% of the total column density .",
    "we call the column density fraction in the complex  c components @xmath221 , and set @xmath222 and @xmath223 .",
    "we required that the adopted model reproduce the available 21 cm emission profiles .",
    "for complex  c , this required a match to the interferometric data described in  2.3 . for the remaining components at @xmath224 kms@xmath2",
    ", this required a match to the single - dish ( 97 beam ) effelsberg data .",
    "model parameters constrained by this criterion can be found in the notes for table  6 .",
    "we required the eight components to have velocities within a few kms@xmath2  of those of the components .",
    "it was necessary to deviate from the velocities slightly for only two of the eight components . for the highest negative velocity component in complex  c ( component # 1 ) ,",
    "the difference was 2 kms@xmath2 ; this deviation is well within the uncertainty of the model velocity but was necessary to reproduce the 21 cm emission profile . for the ism feature at 6.5 kms@xmath2(component # 6 ) , the deviation was 4 kms@xmath2 . in this case , the precise central velocity is not well constrained since additional sub - components ( which do not affect our analysis ) may be present .",
    "the and velocities of all other components in the model were the same .",
    "4 .   with a few notable exceptions discussed below , we adopted the b - values for the components under the assumption that turbulent broadening dominates the line widths . in most cases",
    "the components are strongly saturated and overlapping , so a precise estimate of the individual component widths was not possible .",
    "however , the total widths of the component groups was well constrained by both the absorption - line data and the 21 cm emission data . for the complex  c and positive ivc components ,",
    "the widths could be constrained by the steep absorption walls of the higher order lyman - series lines . for these cases ,",
    "the differences in the and b - values can be understood if there is a thermal contribution to the derived line widths .",
    "we fixed the d / h ratio in all components except the two complex  c components at the local ism value of d / h = @xmath225 ( see moos et al .",

    "terrestrial airglow is a major contaminant of the observed lyman - series profiles .",
    "the width of the airglow emission lines is approximately 100 kms@xmath2  since the airglow fills the fuse lwrs apertures .",
    "fortunately , the intensity of the emission is reduced substantially in the night - only data considered here , and the velocity of the airglow emission is sufficiently low that it does not occur at the velocities expected for the absorption in complex  c ( roughly 250 to 180 kms@xmath2with respect to the rest velocity of the lines ) .",
    "furthermore , the airglow strength diminishes in the higher - order lines in the lyman series .",
    "since the airglow contamination occurs at velocities where the lines are expected to be strongly saturated , the airglow does not compromise the column density and velocity analyses .    in figure  8",

    "we have isolated the absorption due to different component groups in figure  9 , where we show the complex  c , iv  arch , and ism / positive ivc absorption in the ly@xmath229 line .",
    "note that the ism and iv  arch produce no absorption at the expected velocities of the lines in complex  c. the steep absorption wings in the higher order lyman - series lines set limits on the widths of components 1 and 2 ( complex  c ) , and component 8 ( the positive ivc ) .",
    "these widths and their associated uncertainties are listed in table  6 .",
    "we adopt a line width b = @xmath185 kms@xmath2  for component # 1 based on considerations of the 21 cm emission .",
    "we investigated the effects of adding to our model a broad feature associated with the hot gas traced by the absorption in complex  c. sembach et al .",

    "the solar abundance of oxygen is ( o / h)@xmath209 ( allende prieto et al .",
    "thus , for @xmath237 , we find n ( ) @xmath238 @xmath4 . at @xmath239k , the lines arising in the hot gas would have b @xmath240 kms@xmath2  and would produce negligible absorption at the velocities of the lines in complex  c. ( the maximum absorption depth would be @xmath241 of the continuum level in the ly@xmath218 line , and @xmath242% in the higher order lyman - series lines we are interested in here . )",

    "( 2 ) is probably overly simplistic , and more realistic estimates would treat the ( presently unstudied ) non - equilibrium cooling of the gas .",
    "the estimates increase if the gas is not in collisional ionization equilibrium and is at lower temperatures than implied by the presence of .",
    "however , for the and lines of interest in this study , the expected absorption depths at the velocities of the higher order absorption lines are still less than a few percent of the local continuum , even if the value of f@xmath232 / f@xmath233 in the above equation is increased by a factor of 50100 .",
    "a similar conclusion is reached for the associated with the absorption produced by the galactic disk and halo along the sight line . even though the galactic column density is higher than it is in complex  c [ log",
    "n ( ) = @xmath243 ; savage et al .  ( 2003 ) ] , the velocity is lower and the impact on the absorption in complex  c is negligible .",
    "we conclude that the presence of associated with the hot gas traced by in complex  c does not affect the results of our study .",
    "a check on the overall validity of the velocity structure along the sight line is provided by the and ly@xmath16 and ly@xmath218 lines shown in figure  10 .",
    "these lines were not included explicitly in the derivation of the and models .",
    "the ability of the model to reproduce the damping wings of the ly@xmath16 and ly@xmath218 absorption features so reliably in figure  10 indicates that the overall column density estimates for the two dominant components along the sight line ( complex  c and the ism ) are reasonable .",
    "a second check on our model comes from the 21 cm emission data shown in figure  11 , where we have plotted a composite profile using the interferometric results for complex  c ( @xmath244 kms@xmath2 ) , and the single - dish effelsberg data for the iv  arch and ism emission features at @xmath245 kms@xmath2 .",
    "we converted the absorption model into an emission model under the assumption that the gas is optically thin , such that n ( ) @xmath246 ( spitzer 1978 ) .",
    "the agreement of the model and the 21 cm data in figure  11 is excellent , as required by the constraints imposed above .",
    "the weak absorption components ( # 5 and # 7 ) at 29 kms@xmath2  and + 21 kms@xmath2  do not produce significant 21 cm emission .",
    "we note that the interferometric data for the lower velocity features toward pg1259 + 593 are consistent with the single - dish measurements , but are much noisier .",
    "the interferometer data show that there is relatively little small - scale structure in the iv  arch and the low - velocity gas .",
    "the interferometer observation automatically filters out the larger scale ( @xmath247 ) features , leaving little signal in the ism or iv  arch features and implying that arcminute - scale variations are small , no more than 1020% of the total column density .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the iv  arch and the low - velocity clouds along the pg1259 + 593 sight line are relatively close and do not exhibit any bright compact cloud cores .",
    "using the information derived above for and , it is possible to bracket the allowed range of values for n ( ) in complex  c. we considered several approaches for estimating the column density . since most of the lines are weak , the strongest constraints on n ( ) come from the parameters assumed for the stronger complex  c feature ( component # 1 ) . the weaker feature ( component # 2 ) does not contribute significantly to the observed absorption features unless the d / h ratio in this component is an order of magnitude or more higher than the d / h ratio in the stronger component .",
    "for simplicity , we assume that the d / h ratio is the same in both components , and focus our attention on the 127.4 kms@xmath2  component .",
    "the widths of the and lines in the stronger component bracket the width expected for ( i.e. , b = 6.09.6 kms@xmath2 ) .",
    "if we assume that the differences in the b - values between and are due to a combination of turbulent and thermal broadening of the lines , then we can calculate the component widths assuming that b@xmath248 = b@xmath249 + b@xmath250 . solving this equation for the observed and b - values ( see tables  4 and 6 ) simultaneously leads to b@xmath251 kms@xmath2  and @xmath252k .",
    "using these parameters implies b @xmath253 kms@xmath2  for",

    "parameters for the components in this model can be found in table  7 . for the ism and ivc lines ,",

    "the smooth solid line isolates the contribution to the fit produced by absorption along the sight line .",
    "the velocity scale applies to the line shown in each panel . in this model , ( d / h)@xmath258",

    "the underestimated absorption at these velocities , which is highlighted with arrows in the top panels of figures  12 and 13 , is important because it impacts the quality of the fit for the higher - order lines .",
    "the model is driven toward higher values of d / h to fit the ly@xmath219 and ly@xmath215 lines at the expense of slightly over - producing the absorption in the weaker lines . before adopting a final column density and error for n ( ) , we consider some reasons for this underestimate .",
    "first , we considered the possibility that the underestimated absorption may be due to how the total column density in complex  c is distributed between the two components .",
    "in our model we have assumed that the column densities of , , and are divided among the two components such that @xmath222 and @xmath261 .",
    "holding other parameters fixed , we allowed the ratios of n ( ) and n ( ) in the two components to vary .",
    "values of @xmath262 as low as 0.94 improved the fit to the data .",
    "values of @xmath263 produced noticeable discrepancies with the negative velocity absorption walls of the higher order lines , in the sense that too much absorption was predicted . lowering the b - value of component 2 to alleviate this concern reintroduced the discrepancy in the ly@xmath219 and ly@xmath215 lines .",
    "the changes considered affected both n ( ) and n ( ) by the same percentage since the d / h ratio was assumed constant in complex  c. thus , while the fit could be improved slightly , such changes had no effect on ( d / h)@xmath264 .",
    "we also considered whether a difference in the d / h ratio in the two complex  c components might lead to an underestimate of the absorption at lower velocities . to account for the extra absorption by increasing the d / h ratio in the weaker feature ( component # 2 at 112.5 kms@xmath2 ) ,",
    "requires a value of d / h that is at least a factor of 810 times greater than d / h in component  1 .",
    "such a discrepancy is inconsistent with big bang nucleosynthesis estimates of the primordial value of d / h , ( d / h)@xmath265 ( nollett & burles 2000 ; burles et al . 2001 ; spergel et al . 2003 ) , and the expected variations in d / h caused by deuterium astration .",
    "next , we explored the possibility that the residual absorption could be due to an underestimate in the width of the and lines in the main complex  c component at 127.4 kms@xmath2 .",
    "to fit the absorption well would require a width b@xmath266 kms@xmath2 , which is inconsistent with the width of the 21 cm emission shown in figure  11 .",
    "it is possible for the absorption width to be larger than that found for the 21 cm emission if the wings of the absorption consist primarily of low column density gas that is below the detection limit of the radio observations . in this case , the line width could also be increased , resulting in a slightly better fit to the data .",
    "the resulting d / h value is similar to that found for the single - component curve of growth analysis with b@xmath267 described in the next section .",
    "the underestimated absorption may be due to a small amount of fixed - pattern noise in the data for one or both of the sic channels . note that the underestimate is slightly different for the lines shown in figure  12 for the sic2 channel and those shown in figure  13 for the sic1 channel .",
    "if the absorption is actually fixed - pattern noise , the fit may change the derived value of n ( ) since the profile fit is sensitive to absorption at this velocity .",
    "we considered whether adding an additional component to the absorption model to account for the residual absorption affected the fit results .",
    "this feature could be either a component corresponding to a stronger feature near 108 kms@xmath2 , or a weak interloping component near 190 kms@xmath2 . to account for the absorption with additional",
    "requires an component near 108 kms@xmath2with n ( ) @xmath268 @xmath4 if d / h = @xmath269 .",
    "while this additional component would remain hidden in the lyman - series lines , it would lead to a serious conflict with both the observed 21 cm emission and the absorption at this velocity .",
    "an feature at 190 kms@xmath2   with n ( ) @xmath270 @xmath4 and b@xmath271 kms@xmath2  can account for the absorption and remove the noted discrepancy .",
    "the weak high - velocity interloper would be undetectable through either its 21 cm emission or corresponding metal - line absorption ( see  6.1 )",
    ". the associated absorption would not be detectable at higher velocities . in considering this possibility",
    ", we note that the ly@xmath16 and ly@xmath218 lines do not help constrain whether the absorption could be because in both cases the features occur in the strong cores of the overall sight line absorption .",
    "ly@xmath114 is also not restrictive since strong absorption blends with and absorption at this velocity .",
    "if we add a weak feature with these properties to our model and recalculate the fit , we find that the preferred value of n ( ) in complex  c drops from @xmath254 @xmath4 to @xmath272 @xmath4 , and ( d / h)@xmath273 drops from @xmath274 to @xmath275 .",
    "we reproduce figures  12 and 13 in figures  14 and 15 with the additional weak feature added to the model ( i.e. , d / h = @xmath275 ) .",
    "the greater the contribution of this feature , the smaller the inferred d / h ratio in complex  c becomes .",
    "many additional parameters could be tuned to improve the fits shown in figures  14 and 15 , but the degeneracies in the possible solutions preclude a definitive statement about the exact magnitude of the absorption caused by this weak feature .",
    "the discrepancies in the fit caused by the presence or absence of this feature lead to an uncertainty of @xmath276 @xmath4 in the column density .",
    "it is important to note that 21 cm emission with n ( ) @xmath277 @xmath4 is seen near 190 kms@xmath2  along a high - velocity ridge running through complex  c ( see figure  6 in wakker 2001 and figure  13 in sembach et al .",
    "pg1259 + 593 lies off of this ridge by several degrees , and even though there are no metals detected in our absorption - line spectra of pg1259 + 593 , there is still a reasonable possibility that there may be low column density near 190 kms@xmath2  in this direction . in our final estimation of the deuterium abundance in complex  c ,",
    "we will account for the possible range of values of ( d / h)@xmath228 resulting from the inclusion or exclusion of a weak feature .      as an additional consistency check on our profile fitting results for the column density in complex  c",
    ", we constructed curves of growth for the complex  c absorption using the equivalent widths of the lines measured between @xmath278 kms@xmath2 . to make the equivalent width measurements listed in table  8 , we removed the and signatures in the data by dividing the fuse spectra by the adopted and models with the parameters listed in tables  4 and  6 .",
    "next , we measured the absorption in the 50 kms@xmath2  interval in each channel between 160 and 110 kms@xmath2  ( 242 to 192 kms@xmath2  on the velocity scale shown in figures 1215 ) .",
    "this velocity range , which is indicated by the horizontal bar above the ly@xmath215 spectra in figures  12 and 13 , includes the complex  c absorption recovered by our model result but does not include the small amount of residual absorption at lower velocities discussed in the preceding section .",
    "the results of this process are shown in figure  16 , where we plot the data along with both a single - component curve of growth and the double - component curve of growth based upon the fit parameters listed in table  7 .",
    "the best - fit single - component curve of growth yields log  n ( ) = @xmath279 ( 1@xmath139 ) and b = @xmath280 kms@xmath2  ( 1@xmath139 ) .",
    "this column density is less than that implied by the profile fitting process ( at least for the case where there is no interloper ) and the optimum b - value is higher than the b - value for the dominant component .",
    "however , it is still within the possible ranges allowed by the uncertainties in the profile fits .",
    "the single - component cog b - value is determined in large part by the measurements for the ly@xmath219 line in the two channels . since the measurements for this line differ between the two channels by an amount similar to the @xmath34 measurement uncertainties , the resulting b - value is particularly uncertain . for comparison ,",

    "while we can not rule out a value of d / h for complex  c similar to that found for the local ism ( i.e. , d / h  @xmath312 ) , we can reasonably exclude values as low as those determined recently for extended sight lines in the galactic disk ( d / h  @xmath12 ) , provided that the absorption observed is really and not very high velocity .",
    "this conclusion lends support to the hypothesis that complex  c is a manifestation of gas originating outside the milky way , rather than material recirculated between the galactic disk and halo .",
    "a value of d / h @xmath352 for complex  c is consistent with the primordial abundance of deuterium inferred from recent wmap observations of the cosmic microwave background , combined with simple chemical evolution models that predict the amount of deuterium astration with time .",
    "reducing the errors on the d / h estimate in complex  c toward pg1259 + 593 will be difficult , but may eventually be possible with a large space telescope equipped with a high - resolution ultraviolet spectrograph .",
    "10 . the number of sight lines for which can be observed in lyman - series absorption beyond a few hundred parsecs of the sun appears to be small because of velocity crowding .",
    "we considered the data for several other sight lines through complex  c and found that they are unsuitable for a reliable column density determination .",
