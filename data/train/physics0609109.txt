    "an example , which has been explored both experimentally and theoretically in detail , is the formation of ordered projections between retina and tectum , a part of the brain which plays an important role in processing optical information @xcite . at an initial stage of ontogenesis , retinal ganglion cells have random synaptic contacts with the tectum . in the adult animal , however , a so - called _ retinotopic _ projection is realized : neighboring cells of the retina project onto neighboring cells of the tectum . a detailed analytical treatment of hussler and von der malsburg described these ontogenetic processes in terms of self - organization @xcite .",
    "in that work retina and tectum were treated as one - dimensional discrete cell arrays .",
    "the dynamics of the connection weights between retina and tectum were assumed to be governed by the so - called hussler equations . in ref .  @xcite we generalized these equations of evolution to _ continuous _ manifolds of _ arbitrary geometry _ and _ dimension_. furthermore , we performed an extensive synergetic analysis @xcite near the instability of stationary uniform connection weights between retina and tectum .",
    "the resulting generic order parameter equations served as a starting point for analyzing retinotopic projections between euclidean manifolds in ref .",
    "our results for strings turned out to be analogous to those for discrete linear chains , i.e. our model included the special case of hussler and von der malsburg @xcite .",
    "additionally , we could show in the case of planar geometries that superimposing two modes under suitable conditions provides a state with a pronounced retinotopic character .",
    "+ in this paper we apply our general model @xcite again to projections between two - dimensional manifolds .",
    "now , however , we consider manifolds with _ constant positive curvature_. typically , the retina represents approximately a hemisphere , whereas the tectum has an oval form @xcite .",
    "thus , it is biologically reasonable to model both cell sheets by spherical manifolds . without loss of generality",
    "we assume that the two cell sheets for retina and tectum are represented by the surfaces of two unit spheres , respectively .",

    "however , we shall see within a linear analysis in section  [ linanalys ] that this stationary solution becomes unstable at a critical value of the global growth rate .",

    "we include the influence of higher modes upon the connection weights , which leads to recursion relations for the corresponding amplitudes .",

    "in contrast to strings , spherical manifolds represent a more adequate description for retina and tectum .",
    "therefore , the present paper represents an essential progress in the understanding of the ontogenetic development of neural connections between retina and tectum .",

    "<S> we follow our general model in ref .  @xcite and analyze the formation of retinotopic projections for the biologically relevant situation of _ spherical _ geometries . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we elaborate both a linear and a nonlinear synergetic analysis which results in order parameter equations for the dynamics of connection weights between two spherical cell sheets . </S>",
    "<S> we show that these equations of evolution provide stable stationary solutions which correspond to retinotopic modes </S>",
    "<S> . a further analysis of higher modes furnishes proof that our model describes the emergence of a perfect one - to - one retinotopy between two spheres . </S>"
