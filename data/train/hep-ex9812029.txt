    "<S> the latest structure function results , as presented at the ichep98 conference , are reviewed . </S>",
    "<S> a brief introduction to the formalism and the status of global analyses of parton distributions is given . </S>",
    "<S> the review focuses on three experimental areas : fixed - target results and their constraints on the parton densities at high @xmath0 ; spin structure and spin parton densities as well as the status of the associated sum rules ; hera results on the dynamics of @xmath1 at low @xmath2 , charm and @xmath3 as well as the measurement and interpretation of the high-@xmath4 neutral and charged current cross - sections .    _ </S>",
