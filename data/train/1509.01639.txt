    "strictly speaking , the true discontinuous phase transition associated with the magnetization jump of the nodal spins occurs at zero temperature only ( see fig .",
    "[ f21](a ) ) .",

    "it is quite apparent from the eigenvector ( [ 34 ] ) of the upa ground state that the quantum - mechanical motion of two mobile electrons on the interstitial sites gives rise to a kinetically - induced spin frustration of the nodal ising spins at zero temperature . to verify a frustrated character of the nodal spins at finite temperatures",
    "one may take advantage of the concept of temperature - dependent frustration , which requires a negative sign for the product of correlation functions along an elementary plaquette implying incapability of the spins to satisfy all underlying spin - spin interactions .",
    "the negative sign of the product @xmath112 can be achieved just if the longitudinal correlation function between the interstitial spins @xmath94 is predominantly antiferromagnetic ( negative ) .",
    "it has been demonstrated in the previous section that the correlation function @xmath94 indeed changes its sign at a certain temperature when starting from the upa ground state , whereas the relevant frustration temperature can be regarded as an indicator of the transition from the frustrated regime to the non - frustrated one .        the frustration temperature , as calculated from crossing points of the longitudinal correlation function between the interstitial spins @xmath94 , is plotted in fig .  [ f3 ] against the hopping term @xmath113 for a few selected values of the magnetic field .",
    "it turns out that the antiferromagnetic correlation @xmath114 develops just for a sufficiently strong hopping term @xmath115 , because the coupled spin - electron diamond chain may become frustrated only within the upa phase .",
    "the frustration temperature accordingly starts at low enough magnetic fields @xmath116 from the ground - state boundary between the fri and upa phases at @xmath117 , while the initial value of the frustration temperature is progressively shifted along the ground - state boundary between the spa and upa phases @xmath118 at higher magnetic fields @xmath119 .",
    "altogether , it can be concluded that the frustrated regime of the correlated spin - electron diamond chain is delimited from above by the displayed curves of frustration temperature .",
    "last but not least , we will turn our attention to a discussion of the bipartite quantum entanglement between two mobile electrons located at the interstitial sites of a given plaquette , which will be quantified by the fermionic concurrence calculated according to eq .",

    "the low - temperature asymptotic value of the fermionic concurrence has unambiguously confirmed an existence of the quantum entanglement within the upa ground state , while it has also demonstrated rather unexpected re - entrant behavior due to thermally activated excitations when the hopping term drives the investigated model towards the disentangled fri and spa ground states but still preserves it in a vicinity of the ground - state boundary with the quantum upa ground state .",
    "we have also compared the threshold and frustration temperatures with the goal to bring insight into a mutual relationship between the quantum entanglement and geometric spin frustration .",
    "it has been convincingly evidenced that these two physical properties are strongly related yet independent . besides the conventional entangled - frustrated and disentangled - non - frustrated regimes",
    ", we have additionally found entangled - non - frustrated and disentangled - frustrated regimes as well .",
    "although geometric spin frustration and quantum entanglement are closely related features within the present model , this result indicates that thermal fluctuations have distinct influence on these two physical aspects",
    ". it would be valuable to have further studies of quantum spin chains with competing interactions to shed additional light of the relevant thermal processes influencing the interplay between spin frustration and quantum entanglement .",
