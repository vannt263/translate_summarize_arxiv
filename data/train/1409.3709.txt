    "the biological membranes are one of the most important building blocks of living matter .",
    "their mechanical properties determine to a great extent their structure and functioning .",

    "the biomembrane consists of a lipid bilayer , in which integral proteins float .",
    "evidently , in the frames of this model , the mechanical properties of the biomembrane are tightly connected with those of the lipid bilayer .",

    "one of the most widely used methods for determination of the bending elasticity of a lipid bilayer is the analysis of the shape fluctuations of nearly spherical lipid vesicles  @xcite .",

    "the bending energy @xmath12 of the whole patch is : @xmath13    if the patch is not tension free then its stretching energy density @xmath14 is expressed via its tension @xmath2 ( here we assume that @xmath2 is a constant all over the membrane @xcite ) as : @xmath15 where @xmath0 is the stretching elasticity of the bilayer .",

    "this is due to the gauss - bonnet theorem which assures that if the topology of the vesicle does not change then the contribution of this elasticity does not depend on the shape fluctuations of the vesicle .",
