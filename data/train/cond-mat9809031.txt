    "it is well known that two conducting neutral plates placed at a small distance attract each other .",
    "this phenomenon is often called the casimir effect because of the celebrated formula he derived for the force between two perfectly conducting plates@xcite .",
    "casimir calculated the sum of the quantum - mechanical zero - point energies of the normal modes of the electromagnetic ( em ) field between the two metal plates , and showed that the total energy depends on the distance between the plates .",
    "the spatial derivative of the sum gives what we now call the casimir force .",
    "the generalization of the casimir effect to the case of two dielectric plates was made by lifshitz@xcite , and his formula was rederived by van kampen , nijboer , and schram@xcite using a technique attributed to casimir .",
    "the casimir force is essentially a long - range van der waals force , where one can not ignore the delay caused by the finiteness of the velocity of light .",
    "this retardation effect is not always a small correction and may alter the very nature of the force .",
    "for example , the casimir force between two perfectly conducting hemispherical shells has been shown to be repulsive@xcite .",
    "experimental studies of the casimir force started long ago@xcite and have culminated in a recent high - resolution measurement by lamoreaux@xcite .",
    "a closely related phenomenon , the retarded attraction force between an atom and a metal plate ( the casimir - polder force@xcite ) , was also measured successfully by sukenik _",
    "et al_.@xcite . with further improvements",
    ", it will hopefully be possible to confirm experimentally the theoretical predictions of several corrections , such as finite - temperature effects  @xcite and radiative corrections@xcite .",
    "the scope of the research of the casimir effect covers many areas of physics and other fields , ranging from biology to cosmology and elementary particle physics .",
    "reviews and extensive references are available , for example , in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the casimir effect has usually been attributed to zero - point fluctuations of the em field .",
    "however , schwinger and his collaborators@xcite showed that the casimir effect can be derived in terms of schwinger s source theory , which has no explicit reference to vacuum - field fluctuations of the em field .",
    "milonni and shih have recently developed a source theory of the casimir effect within the framework of conventional quantum electrodynamics @xcite . in this theory ,",
    "the casimir force originates from quantum fluctuations of atomic dipoles in the dielectric , and the em field plays only the passive role of mediating interactions between those dipoles .",
    "it seems like it is only a matter of taste whether we attribute the casimir effect to the quantum nature of the em field or to that of the matter .",
    "accordingly , the following questions naturally arise : do the field and the matter really play ( or to what extent do they play ) symmetrical roles in this problem ? why do some approaches emphasize the quantum nature of the em field and others stress that of the matter ? to answer these questions , it would be of interest to discuss this problem from a standpoint that has no preference for the field or for the matter . unfortunately , existing theories do not suit this purpose because they all invoke in one way or another the maxwell equations in which the degrees of freedom of the matter are in advance embedded in the frequency dependence of the dielectric response function .",
    "the primary purpose of this paper is to propose a matter - field theory of the casimir force in which the matter and the field are treated on an equal footing .",
    "our strategy is to explicitly diagonalize the matter - field hamiltonian which is quadratic in its dynamical variables .",
    "because relevant physical quantities are then expressed in terms of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the full hamiltonian , all physical effects allow unambiguous interpretation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",

    "section  [ sec : max ] proves that this derivation leads to the same results as existing theories  @xcite .",
    "it will be shown that in our treatment both field and matter contributes zero - point energies . section  [ sec : previous ] analyzes the previous derivations of the casimir force and points out that an inherent asymmetry indeed exists in the problem between the field and the matter , which favors the interpretation of the casimir force as originating from zero - point fluctuations of the em field in some formulations@xcite , and from those of the matter in others@xcite .",

    "instead of using a time - independent perturbation theory , we can also obtain @xmath186 by a time - dependent perturbation theory with the hamiltonian @xmath187 , where the limit @xmath188 is implied .",
    "hence @xmath189 up to second order , we have @xmath190 this corresponds to the interaction energy assumed in ref .",
    "the following relations are useful for the following calculation : @xmath191    since the interaction @xmath0 consists of the products of commuting operators , changing the ordering of operators in @xmath0 should not affect the value of @xmath192 .",
    "let us take one particular ordering of @xmath193 and substitute eqs .",
    "( [ eq : uau ] ) and ( [ eq : ubu ] ) directly into @xmath194 without changing the order of operators . in the resulting expression ,",
    "the operators for mode @xmath195 appear in normal order , and therefore do not contribute to the expectation value in the vacuum .",
    "thus , @xmath192 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltae ] ) is expressed only in terms of zero - point fluctuations of mode @xmath196 as @xmath197    if we take another choice of operator ordering for @xmath0 , @xmath198 the same procedure leads to @xmath199 in this case , the correction is attributable to quantum fluctuations of mode @xmath195 .",
    "the second - order correction to the ground - state energy of a pair of linearly coupled harmonic oscillators can therefore be attributed solely to zero - point fluctuations of either one of the oscillators .    now , back to the original problem of the casimir force .",
    "we notice@xcite that the force is derived from the change in the energy of the entire system when we add atoms in an infinitesimally thin layer next to the boundary @xmath3@xcite .",
    "the dominant contribution to this change arises from the interaction energy between the added atoms and the field modes , either of which may be described as a set of harmonic oscillators .",
    "thus , as in the simple system discussed above , we can attribute the change in energy to the fluctuations of the added atoms alone , provided that an appropriate operator ordering is chosen ( matter theory ) .",
    "we emphasize that the logical consistency of this interpretation hinges heavily on second - order perturbation theory as applied to a system of linearly coupled harmonic oscillators ( linear - response theory ) .",
    "if effects of higher - order interactions are not negligible , it would be nontrivial to construct either genuine matter theory or field theory that is consistent with each other .",
    "if we choose another appropriate operator ordering , the casimir force may be interpreted as arising from quantum fluctuations of the em field modes , and we obtain a kind of field theory of the casimir force .",
    "but the machinery is similar to the field theories described earlier , that is , the field modes are actually not the genuine em field modes but the combined modes of the em field and the matter .",
    "second - order perturbation theory ( or linear - response theory ) thus allows the interpretation of the casimir force as arising from quantum fluctuations of the genuine matter alone but not from those of the genuine em field alone .",
    "the reason for this asymmetry lies again in the property of the boundary .",
    "that is , an infinitesimal displacement of the boundary only affects the mode functions of the genuine matter but has no direct effect on the mode functions of the genuine em field .",
    "the origin of the casimir force has usually been attributed to zero - point fluctuations of the em field , and sometimes to those of the matter .",
    "we have formulated the problem by starting from the lagrangian that describes the em field , collective modes of the matter , and their interaction .",
    "this approach makes it clear that the casimir effect , in actual fact , arises from the change in zero - point energies of certain combined modes of the transverse em field , the transverse motion of charges , and the surface plasmons .",
    "the zero - point energy of the entire system is therefore contributed by both the em field and the matter .",
    "the casimir force arises not from the zero - point energy _ per se _ , but from its change with respect to a virtual infinitesimal displacement of the plates .",
    "this change alters the mode functions of the matter alone , and does not affect those of the em field . because of this asymmetry , it is possible to construct a genuine matter theory but it is difficult to conceive a genuine field theory .",
    "a most natural derivation of the casimir force seems to be to calculate the zero - point energy first and then take its derivative .",
    "the original derivation by casimir follows this approach . in this type of approach ,",
    "both field and matter contribute to the zero - point energy as in our theory .",
    "nevertheless , one encounters descriptions in the literature to the effect that the casimir force is the hallmark of zero - point energies of the genuine em field .",
    "perhaps the main reason for this ( strictly speaking incorrect ) recognition lies in the fact that while the system has the region where only the em field ( including the vacuum ) exists , there is no region where only the matter exists . this also reflects the above - mentioned asymmetry between the field and the matter .",

    ", we should remove the same amount of atoms from the other surface so that the volume of the slab is kept constant ; otherwise the bulk plasmons would also contribute to the change in energy .",
    "we should take into account both effects of adding and removing atoms in evaluating the change in energy ."
