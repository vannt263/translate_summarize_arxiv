    "synchrotron radiation is an important tool in many disciplines .",

    "motivated by this , the investigation of mechanisms for the control of the radiation parameters is of great interest . particularly important is the study of the influence of medium on the spectral and angular characteristics of the synchrotron radiation .",
    "the presence of medium can essentially change the characteristics of the high - energy electromagnetic processes . moreover , new types of phenomena arise .",
    "well - known examples are cherenkov and transition radiations .    in @xcite-@xcite we have investigated the synchrotron radiation from a charge rotating around / inside a dielectric cylinder enclosed by a homogeneous medium .",
    "it has been shown that under the cherenkov condition for the material of the cylinder and the particle velocity , strong narrow peaks appear in the angular distribution of the radiation intensity in the exterior medium . at these peaks the radiated energy exceeds the corresponding quantity in the case of a homogeneous medium by several orders of magnitude .",
    "similar features for the radiation generated by a charge moving along a helical orbit have been discussed in @xcite - saha09 . the case for an electron rotating around / inside",

    "there is radiation which propagates inside the cylinder and it is of interest to investigate the relative contribution of these modes to the total intensity . in the present paper",

    "two quantities are evaluated : the work done by the radiation field on the charge and the energy flux passing through the cross - section of the cylinder .",
    "we show that these two quantities differ . in section [ sec : intext ] we investigate the part of the radiation intensity in the exterior region corresponding to the eigenmodes of the dielectric cylinder and exponentially decreasing outside the cylinder .",
    "it is shown that the difference between the intensity evaluated by the work done by the radiation field and the intensity evaluated by the flux through the cross - section of the cylinder is due to the energy flux carrying by the eigenmodes of the cylinder in the exterior region .",

    "as we have seen in the present paper , the insertion of a dielectric waveguide provides an additional mechanism for tuning the characteristics of the synchrotron radiation by choosing the parameters of the waveguide .",
    "the radiated energy inside the cylinder is redistributed among the cylinder modes and , as a result , the corresponding spectrum differs significantly from the homogeneous medium or free - space results .",
    "this change is of special interest in the low - frequency range where the distribution of the radiation energy among small number of modes leads to the enhancement of the spectral density for the radiation intensity .",
    "the radiation emitted on the waveguide modes propagates inside the cylinder and the waveguide serves as a natural collector for the radiation .",
    "this eliminates the necessity for focusing to achieve a high - power spectral intensity .",
