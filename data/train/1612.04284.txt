    "with a view to discover a possible candidate of the elusive dark matter  namely , the weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp)@xcite  the xenon dark matter project for direct wimp detection has been launched . using a xenon dual - phase time projection chamber ( tpc ) , it searches for an energy deposition in the detector by the elastic scattering of wimps off xenon nuclei .",
    "the xenon1 t detector with a total amount of liquid xenon of 3.3 tons has started data taking and is designed to reach a sensitivity more than an order of magnitude beyond the current limits with a two ton - year exposure , probing new dark matter parameter space@xcite .",
    "the intrinsic background contamination of the xenon itself is one of the most critical contributors to the total background for large detector masses , and thus for the sensitivity of the detector . in the calculation of the projected sensitivity ,",
    "the er background was assumed to be equal to @xmath6 , mainly due to radon intrinsic to the liquid xenon@xcite .",
    "another key contaminant is , a @xmath0-emitter with a half - life of 10.76y and an endpoint energy of 687kev .",
    "although background reduction techniques are applied at the analysis level to discriminate these beta decays from wimp - induced nuclear recoils , active removal of krypton is needed before starting the dark matter search to reduce the remaining background to a tolerable level . for the xenon1 t experiment , a concentration of natural krypton in xenon /xe@xmath7200ppq ] , assuming a ratio of @xmath8{kr}/\\isotope[\\rm{nat}]{kr}=2\\cdot10^{-11}$ ] , is necessary to keep the background from krypton subdominant with respect to the one from radon , and so to meet the background requirements@xcite . in future experiments , using multiple tonnes of liquid xenon as fiducial target , the purity constraints are even more stringent , e.g. , for the xenonnt@xcite , lz@xcite and darwin@xcite experiments , where concentrations of well below @xmath9ppq have to be achieved .",
    "commercially available xenon gas can be delivered with krypton concentrations in the range from @xmath10ppm ] to @xmath11ppb ] , which is generally not clean enough for dark matter experiments using liquid xenon detectors .",
    "separation of krypton from xenon can be achieved thanks to the different physical properties of xenon and krypton , such as the difference in vapour pressures or their different mobilities in porous media .",
    "the former property is exploited in cryogenic distillation while the latter is used in chromatographic systems . the lux experiment uses gas chromatography to achieve a krypton concentration in xenon down to 4ppt ] after a single - pass through the removal system and below 200ppq after two passes@xcite .",
    "cryogenic distillation has first been utilized by the xmass collaboration , reaching a concentration of 3ppt@xcite .",
    "the same type of column was used in xenon100 to produce a purified output concentration of 19ppt at a purification speed of 0.6kg / h@xcite .",
    "after several cycles of distillation , even lower concentrations of about @xmath10ppt were obtained in xenon100@xcite and pandax@xcite .    in this paper , we present a new distillation column , designed and built with an increased purification speed of 3kg / h ( 8.3standard liters per minute ( slpm ) ) .",
    "it features a minimal loss of krypton - enriched xenon of @xmath12 and a higher separation performance . starting with a concentration in the ppb range , a reduction factor of @xmath13",
    "is needed to achieve the purity required for xenon1 t .",
    "the reduction factor is defined as the ratio of the krypton concentration in the in - gas @xmath14 divided by the concentration in the purified liquid - out sample @xmath15 @xmath16    section  [ sec : mccabe - thiele ] introduces the conceptional design of the new system based on the commonly used mccabe - thiele method@xcite .",
    "the detection of krypton in xenon is an important aspect when characterizing distillation systems , which is treated in section  [ sec : diagnostic_krypton ] .",
    "the development of the distillation column was divided into three phases .",
    "it started with a single stage distillation setup ( phase-0 ) , already presented in@xcite , before starting the construction of a multi - stage test setup ( phase-1 ) to investigate different aspects of the separation , summarized in section[sect : phase-1 ] .",
    "the final , and improved , setup for the xenon1 t experiment ( phase-2 ) was commissioned at the laboratori nazionali del gran sasso ( lngs ) in italy and is presented in section  [ sec : phase-2 ] .",
    "the distillation process as described in@xcite is based on the difference of vapour pressures of the two components in an ideal binary mixture , in our case krypton and xenon . assuming a static liquid xenon reservoir in equilibrium with the gaseous phase above , the more volatile component ( krypton )",
    "is enriched in the gaseous phase .",
    "the enhancement in concentration can be described by the relative volatility @xmath17 , which is deduced by using raoult s law to be the ratio between the vapour pressures of the two components : @xmath18 the volatility can also be interpreted as a measure of the probability for krypton to migrate into the gaseous phase at liquid xenon temperatures .    in phase-0 ,",
    "a single stage distillation system was realized , containing liquid xenon with a gaseous phase above .",
    "such a system allowed the investigation of the dynamics of a distillation process in a volume with a single liquid - gas interface and steady state mass flow at very low concentrations of krypton in xenon in the ppq range@xcite .",
    "this allowed the first measurement of the relative volatility at such low concentrations of krypton in xenon , finding that @xmath19 , consistent with raoult s law even in this regime .",
    "the measurements also confirmed the general prediction that a single distillation stage is not enough to achieve separation of @xmath20@xcite .",
    "therefore , the distillation column presented here employs the techniques commonly used in distillation plants , where a series of distillation stages is used to successively reduce the krypton concentration to the desired level of purity .     and @xmath21 are the down - going liquid streams while @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the up - going gaseous streams in the different parts .",
    "both are connected to the feeding stream @xmath24 .",
    "the krypton enriched off - gas stream @xmath25 is extracted from the top while the purified xenon is extracted from the bottom with a flow rate @xmath26 .",
    "the krypton in xenon concentrations of the feed and the two extraction flows are given by @xmath14 , @xmath27 and @xmath15 , while @xmath28 defines the state of matter of the injected xenon.,width=302 ]    in the simplest configuration , the distillation column is treated as a system with three sections as shown in figure[fig : figure_1_scheme_distillation ] . the feeding section where the xenon is injected to the distillation tower , the rectifying section above where the more volatile component is enriched , and the stripping section below the feeding section where the more volatile component is depleted . setting the reboiler stage in the stripping section as the starting point ,",
    "the binary mixture is evaporated and a gaseous stream flows upwards at a flow rate of @xmath29 . assuming that the vapour will condense on the next stage ( plate 1 ) ,",
    "the generated liquid phase on this stage will have the same composition as the vapour from the reboiler stage , and will therefore have a higher concentration of krypton compared to the starting mixture . by repeating this procedure for several stages , the fraction of krypton in xenon will successively increase . on top of the tower , the vapour is partially liquefied with the help of the re - condenser and fed back to the column with a flow rate @xmath30 .",
    "a small fraction of the gas is taken out as krypton enriched off - gas at a flow rate @xmath25 , while the purified xenon is extracted at the bottom with a flow rate @xmath26 .",
    "such an operation with a partial reflux is called rectification .",
    "the xenon , injected at the feeding section at a flow rate  @xmath24 , is added to either the up - streaming vapour  @xmath22 in the rectifying section or to the down - streaming liquid flow  @xmath31 .",
    "this depends on the state of the injected matter ( gaseous or liquid ) , which is described by the caloric factor  @xmath28 .",
    "depending on the requested krypton in xenon concentration at the bottom ( purified xenon , liquid - out ) and at the top ( krypton enriched xenon , off - gas ) the number of distillation stages can be calculated using the mccabe - thiele method@xcite . in this method , described in the following paragraphs",
    ", the concentration of krypton in the gaseous and liquid phase can be calculated to derive an equilibrium diagram , which is shown in figure  [ fig : figure_2_mccabe_thiele ] .",
    "based on the vapour pressures and the relative volatility @xmath17 , the relation between the krypton concentration in the gaseous phase @xmath32 and the liquid phase @xmath33 for very low concentrations ( @xmath34 ) in equilibrium is defined as @xmath35 this relation is called the equilibrium line and is shown in red in figure [ fig : figure_2_mccabe_thiele ] .    by heating from the bottom and cooling from the top ,",
    "the equilibrium inside the column is disturbed by the upward gaseous and downward liquid flows introduced in the column .",
    "the actual concentration of krypton in the gaseous phase related to the concentration in the liquid phase can be described , due to the mass flow , by operating lines , defined below . for each section , an operation line for the diagram",
    "is determined , shown in figure  [ fig : figure_2_mccabe_thiele ] marked as gray , blue and green lines respectively .",
    "a forcing concentration gradient is ensured between the equilibrium line and operating lines , driving the system towards the equilibrium via mass transfer between the ascending gaseous stream and the descending liquid stream .",
    "the determination of the operation lines@xcite is briefly reviewed here .",
    "the total mass balance depends on the design specifications as introduced in section  [ sec : introduction ] .",
    "the incoming flow @xmath36 ( in - gas ) is equal to the outgoing flows at the reboiler @xmath37 ( purified xenon , liquid - out ) and at the condenser @xmath38 ( krypton enriched xenon , off - gas , fixed by design to 1@xmath39 of in - gas ) during stable operation , giving the total mass - balance , @xmath40     in relation to the concentration in the liquid phase @xmath33 .",
    "the operation lines for the different sections of the column are drawn and allow for the determination of the number of theoretical stages needed to meet the xenon1 t requirements ( black line ) .",
    "the definitions of the equilibrium and operation lines are taken from@xcite.,width=309 ]    this can also be written in terms of krypton particles , using the different concentrations of krypton in the feed @xmath41 , in the off - gas @xmath42 and in the liquid - out @xmath43 , @xmath44 for an input concentration of @xmath45ppb and the pre - defined purified output concentration for xenon1 t , @xmath46ppq , the concentration in the off - gas can be calculated as @xmath47ppm for the given flows .    in the rectifying section , the krypton concentration on a distillation stage @xmath32 in the vapour stream @xmath22",
    "can be calculated using the krypton particle balance to get the operating line ( rectifying line ) @xmath48 where @xmath30 is the liquid xenon flux in the rectifying section .",
    "@xmath49 is called the reflux ratio and describes the amount of xenon that is fed back as liquid ( @xmath30 ) from the top , related to the flow of extracted off - gas @xmath25 @xmath50 for good separation performance , a high reflux ratio @xmath49 is mandatory@xcite .",
    "since @xmath51 worked well for the xenon100 column@xcite and was not the limiting factor in terms of separation efficiency , the same value for the xenon1 t system was used in the initial design .",
    "the liquid xenon flux is calculated as @xmath52kg / h , which directly defines the amount of cooling power needed at the top condenser to be @xmath53w in order to liquefy the xenon .",
    "the operation line for the stripping section is determined by the liquid and gaseous flow rates @xmath31 and @xmath29 , respectively @xmath54 with @xmath55 being the reflux ratio of gas evaporated from the reboiler , defined as @xmath56 for the determination of @xmath55 , the flow rate of down - streaming liquid @xmath31 has to be calculated , which is a combination of liquid flows from the rectifying section and also from the feeding section , @xmath57 in the feeding section , the down - streaming liquid flow and the up - streaming gaseous flow depend on the thermal state of the feed .",
    "different feed configurations are possible , drastically influencing the mass flow along the column .",
    "the caloric factor @xmath58 describes the feeding condition in the mass balance .",
    "the design for the xenon1 t column foresees the usage of a saturated liquid feed at the boiling point @xmath59 .",
    "this does not affect the vapour stream and is directly added to @xmath30 . taking this into account , @xmath60kg / h and @xmath61 are used for the calculation of the stripping line .",
    "the mccabe - thiele diagram , shown in figure  [ fig : figure_2_mccabe_thiele ] , was drawn for a saturated liquid feed ( @xmath62 ) , indicated by the intersection line ( in this case vertical ) of the two operation lines and a starting concentration of @xmath45ppb .",
    "the number of black steps in the diagram indicates the number of theoretical stages and can be determined by taking the liquefaction processes and the related vapour compositions into account .",
    "a liquid mixture with the krypton content @xmath33 has a vapour phase with an enhanced krypton concentration @xmath32 , which is streaming up to the next stage ( vertical line ) where it gets liquefied again ( horizontal line ) .    in total 9 theoretical distillation stages",
    "are needed to reach a reduction factor of @xmath63 .",
    "this allows commercial xenon to be purified in a single pass through the column . for a saturated vapour feed @xmath64 ,",
    "the diagram changes slightly and 10 stages are needed in order to achieve the same separation .    in practice , multiple single distillation stages",
    "are not practical .",
    "however , by utilizing a structured package material ( sulzer ag , laboratory package , type ex ) inside the column , featuring a large surface area for good liquid - gas exchange through the full height of the column , the effective exchange is equivalent to a certain number of theoretical single distillation stages .",
    "the height - equivalent of one theoretical plate ( hetp ) denotes the amount of required package material to realize one distillation stage .",
    "together with the number of predicted plates @xmath65 derived from the mccabe - thiele diagram , the total height @xmath66 of the package tube can be calculated : @xmath67 the hetp value is determined empirically and varies for different compositions and system parameters .",
    "typical values for the package type used here are @xmath68cm@xcite , but it has not been measured for a krypton - xenon mixture so far .",
    "furthermore , the partial pressure of krypton in the injected krypton - xenon mixture is already very low , due to its low feed concentration @xmath6910ppb .",
    "the investigations on the single stage distillation setup confirmed the separation process on the ppq scale for krypton and xenon to be in agreement with the expectations from the relative volatility@xcite .",
    "however , for this concentration regime the mccabe - thiele approach has not been validated for larger distillation plants .",
    "due to these uncertainties it was decided to first realize a smaller distillation column , using 1 m of package material ( phase-1 column ) and increase the amount of material afterwards , if needed ( phase-2 column ) .",
    "the components of the phase-1 column were designed to allow an easy upgrade from phase-1 to phase-2 .",
    "the measurement of trace amounts of krypton in xenon is important for the characterization of the cryogenic distillation column .",
    "the xenon collaboration developed several techniques for trace gas measurements to detect natural krypton in xenon to the sub - ppt level@xcite .",
    "a @xmath70 tracer method was developed by westflische wilhelms - universitt ( wwu ) mnster , where @xmath70 is injected to the feed gas .",
    "the measurement of the decay of @xmath70 , which chemically behaves as natural krypton , at the inlet and the two outlets of the column allows investigating the stability of the distillation process as well as its dynamics over time .",
    "the method has been successfully used for the single stage system as well as for the phase-1 and phase-2 columns .",
    "it is presented in more detail in@xcite .      for an online measurement of the absolute concentration of natural krypton in xenon ,",
    "a system based on@xcite was developed at wwu mnster . by using a residual gas analyzer ( rga ) behind a ln@xmath71-cooled coldtrap ,",
    "an enhanced sensitivity for concentrations down to the sub - ppb level was achieved . the xenon gas sample ( @xmath72ml )",
    "was introduced into a spiral gas routing pipe , which was cooled to 77k by submerging it in liquid nitrogen .",
    "this provides an artificial enhancement of the krypton concentration as most of the xenon is frozen at this part whereas the krypton remains gaseous due the its higher vapour pressure and low partial pressure .",
    "the sample was injected into a measurement chamber equipped with a commercial quadrupol mass - filter ( inficon , transpector 2 h200 m ) and an oil - free turbo - molecular pumping system .",
    "a custom - made butterfly valve was mounted before the pump , which allowed the control of the gas load inside the measurement chamber by adjusting the effective pumping speed .",
    "this increased the dynamic range and provided higher sensitivity .",
    "a similar version described in @xcite was constructed with a sensitivity limit of @xmath73  ppt , obtained from calibration with different known krypton concentrations .",
    "since the expected concentration of the distilled xenon is at the ppq level , only a lower limit for the separation efficiency can be given .",
    "however , this setup provides valuable online feedback on the performance of the distillation column .",
    "the most sensitive device used to characterize the kr - removal capability of the distillation columns is the rare gas mass spectrometer ( rgms ) , developed at the max - planck - institut fr kernphysik in heidelberg .",
    "it detects trace amounts of natural krypton in xenon down to the ppq level .",
    "the projected detection limit was determined to be @xmath74ppq@xcite .",
    "similar to the coldtrap rga technique , a separation of the bulk of xenon from the krypton component has to be done before the sample is injected into the analyzer .",
    "this separation is realized by gas - chromatography .",
    "the phase-1 distillation column has a total height of 3.5 m and uses 1.1 m of package material in the distillation tower .",
    "figure  [ fig : figure_3_pid_phase_1 ] shows the p@xmath75i diagram of the system as well as the infrastructure which allows different performance studies .",
    "the column consists of four main components , the input condenser , the package tube , the top condenser and the reboiler . at the input condenser ,",
    "equipped with a cryo - cooler ( leybold cp-50 ) , the injected xenon is liquefied with a maximum cooling power of @xmath9w at , before it is passed to the package tube where the distillation process takes place .",
    "the tube is filled with structured package material made from stainless steel ( sulzer ex , diameter 45 mm ) as shown in figure[fig : figure_4_package ] and is equipped with different feeding ports ( labeled lf1-lf3 for liquid feed injected from the bottom and gf1 for gaseous feed injected from the top of the input condenser ) in order to allow for different feeding conditions .",
    "the top condenser is equipped with a cryo - cooler ( leybold cp-140 t ) providing @xmath76w of cooling power at .",
    "the reboiler at the bottom stores and evaporates the liquid xenon using heater cartridges with a maximum of @xmath77w heating power available .",
    "the entire setup is housed inside a vacuum insulation vessel , pumped to @xmath78 mbar in order to minimize thermal losses .",
    "both condensers are equipped with calibrated silicon diodes ( lakeshore dt-670d - cu ) providing accurate temperature monitoring , while additional pt-1000 sensors at different locations complete the overall temperature supervision ( not shown in figure  [ fig : figure_3_pid_phase_1 ] ) .",
    "the most important system parameter is the pressure inside the package tube , measured with a capacitive manometer ( mks baratron 121a , labeled as pi23 ) while the inlet and the outlet pressures pi21 and pi22 are measured with a capacitive manometer with lower precision ( swagelok ptu series )",
    ". the differential pressure along the package tube is also measured ( mks baratron 221b ; @xmath79 ) .",
    "the same type of differential pressure sensor ( @xmath80 ) is used to obtain the height of the liquid xenon level inside the reboiler by measuring the hydrostatic pressure of the liquid in relation to the column pressure .",
    "the mass - balance inside the system is controlled by three mass - flow controllers ( mks 1479b ) labeled as fic01 for the in - gas , fic02 for the purified liquid - out and fic03 for the krypton enriched off - gas . the liquid - out and",
    "the in - gas flows are thermodynamically coupled by a plate - heat exchanger ( gea gbs 100m-200r ; he1 ) . a rupture disc ( rd )",
    "was added for the release of accidental overpressures greater than @xmath81bar .",
    "three @xmath70 decay detectors ( kd ) are implemented at the in - gas , as well as at the liquid - out and the off - gas lines .        in order to guarantee a high xenon purity ,",
    "all parts were either made from electro - polished stainless steel ( alloy 316l and 316ln ) or from oxygen - free , high thermal conductivity ( ofhc ) copper .",
    "all connections were either made by metal sealed vcr connections or cf flanges , while the fittings for the vcr connection were orbitally welded to the pipes to achieve optimal leak - tightness and clean weld seams .",
    "all components were very carefully cleaned and the assembled system was baked , evacuated and xenon gas was circulated through a hot getter ( saes ps4-mt15-r-2 ) in a closed loop via v6 to further reduce remaining impurities .      before starting the distillation process ,",
    "the column is cooled down and filled with xenon in order to achieve a certain liquid level inside the reboiler vessel , ( @xmath82-@xmath83)cm corresponding to ( @xmath83-@xmath81)kg , and the input condenser ( @xmath10 kg ) to realize the liquid feed condition .",
    "the regulation circuit stabilizes the pressure inside the system to about @xmath84bar absolute by adjusting the heater power in the reboiler and by keeping the applied cooling power at the top condenser constant , thereby establishing a stable xenon flux along the package tube .",
    "the distillation run is performed by flushing xenon from the storage bottle , through the getter purification stage , and into the distillation column . for the storage of purified liquid - out gas , and also for krypton enriched off - gas ,",
    "two aluminum gas bottles are cooled in a liquid nitrogen bath .      for an optimal separation of krypton and xenon",
    ", the distillation process needs to be thermodynamically stable such that the mass exchange between liquid and gas streams are guaranteed .",
    "thus , it is working ideally after the pressure in the system has been stabilized and mass balance is achieved .",
    "this means that the amount of xenon gas that is fed into the column equals to the extracted xenon gas .",
    "thus , the flows are adjusted until the balance @xmath24=@xmath26+@xmath25 is reached .",
    "figure [ fig : figure_5_thermodynamic_phase_1 ] presents relevant parameters of an 11 hour distillation run , using a liquid feed condition ( @xmath62 ) , injected at port lf2 ( see figure  [ fig : figure_3_pid_phase_1 ] ) .",
    "the first diagram shows the absolute pressure inside the distillation column ( pi23 ) , which was set to 1.9bar .",
    "after five hours of regulation time , the measured pressure at the sensor was @xmath85 , matching the set - point with a standard deviation of @xmath86bar .",
    "the differential pressure along the package tube ( @xmath79 ) is an important parameter in order to avoid flooding of the package with liquid xenon which can reduce the performance .",
    "the differential pressure was measured to be @xmath87 leading to a pressure drop of about @xmath88 of package material , slightly below the recommended value of @xmath89@xcite .",
    "consequently , there is no flooding of the package during this run .",
    "the differential pressure in the reboiler indicates that the mass - balance and the feeding is working properly . when the distillation is started , the liquid level changes due to feeding , liquid extraction at the bottom , and turbulences due to the regulation .",
    "after some time it stabilizes at @xmath90 ( equivalent to a height of 22 mm ) .",
    "the relative change in the liquid level during the last 5hours of the distillation was only @xmath91@xmath39 , indicating very good mass - balance stability .",
    "finally , the third panel shows the different flow rates at the in - gas and the purified liquid - out lines .",
    "the run was performed at an average flow rate of @xmath92 , with a fraction of 1.1% going into the off - gas .",
    "the reflux ratio was measured to be @xmath93 , slightly smaller than foreseen from section  [ sec : mccabe - thiele ] .",
    "this can be explained by heat - input to the system from the outside , by thermal radiation or heat bridges , leading to a reduced effective cooling power at the top condenser and thus a smaller reflux .",
    "nevertheless , the effect on the performance is expected to be small according to mccabe - thiele diagram calculations .",
    "additional performance studies were carried out at increased process speeds of up to 16slpm which turned out to be thermodynamically stable .",
    "these rates could only be achieved with the heat exchanger he1 , working at an efficiency of @xmath9490% , in agreement with measurements in@xcite . without the heat exchanger ,",
    "the cooling power provided by the input condenser would not be sufficient to guarantee a saturated liquid feed .",
    "the final limit on the process speed for the phase-1 system is given by the flow controllers which are capable of a maximum speed of 20slpm ( @xmath95kg / h ) .",
    "since the purified output was well below the sensitivity limit of the coldtrap rga system , the rgms technique was used to measure the reduction factor of the distillation column .",
    "a xenon gas sample was extracted into a transport container and shipped to mpik heidelberg . in order to avoid any contamination of the sample , the container consisted of four metal - sealed @xmath96vcr valves , welded together in series to enclose three volumes of a total of about @xmath97 which were filled with sample gas .",
    "the main advantage of three volumes is the separation of the central volume by the two adjacent ones from ambient air which contains a 1.1ppm fraction of natural krypton .",
    "even minute contamination due to leakage of the valves are thus avoided .",
    "finally , two containers were used to draw samples from the in - gas and the purified liquid - out lines .",
    "they were mounted to the phase-1 column , baked and evacuated for two days to establish a clean environment inside the storage container before the samples were taken .",
    "the distillation was performed at a process speed of @xmath92 , with 1.1% off - gas flow - rate and a reflux ratio of @xmath98 .",
    "the samples were drawn after the system was stable for six hours .",
    "the off - line analysis showed a concentration in the in - gas line of @xmath99 which was calculated from the average over three measurements .",
    "for the liquid - out sample each of the three storage volumes was measured two times , for a total of six measurements .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ tab : results_liq_out ] .",
    "c c c volume & xe [ @xmath100 & @xmath101 $ ] + 1st & 2.24 & @xmath102 1st & 2.09 & @xmath103 2nd & 2.85 & @xmath104 2nd & 1.22 & @xmath105 3rd & 0.23 & @xmath106 3rd & 1.73 & @xmath107    [ tab : results_liq_out ]    the concentration of krypton in the purified liquid - out line is thus @xmath108    this is the first demonstration that cryogenic distillation is capable of producing impurities on the ppq - level .",
    "the krypton concentration is more than a factor 30 lower than ever achieved with the xenon100 column .",
    "furthermore , it fulfills the requirements for xenon1 t ( @xmath2 ) and for future multi - ton experiments like xenonnt , lz or darwin , requiring a krypton content below @xmath109@xcite .",
    "although the rgms system is sensitive down to 8ppq@xcite , only a limit on the purified concentration is given due to the spread in the different measurements .",
    "the actual output of the distillation plant might be even purer , but uncertainties in sample retrieval , storage and transport might lead to an increase of the krypton content over time .",
    "the reduction factor is conservatively estimated to be @xmath110",
    "it turned out that the phase-1 column was not able to purify xenon with high concentrations of @xmath111 of helium , argon and krypton , or electronegative impurities like oxygen and water , due to thermodynamic instability .",
    "thus , further improvements were made . both condensers ( input and top )",
    "were modified to improve the gas collection for the processing of highly contaminated xenon .",
    "compared to the phase-1 system , the improved setup was extended to 2.8 m of package material , reaching a total height of about 5.5 m as shown in figure  [ fig : figure_6_picture_phase_2 ] .",
    "a third differential pressure gauge was implemented to measure the liquid level inside the input condenser , to allow for a more precise monitoring of the xenon feed .",
    "after the successful construction and commissioning of the phase-2 column at wwu mnster , the system was dismounted , shipped to the gran sasso underground laboratory lngs and re - assembled underground .",
    "figure  [ fig : figure_7_thermodynamic_phase_2 ] shows the key parameters of the first long - term distillation run over several days at the gran sasso lab . about 212 kg of xenon were distilled at a flow rate of @xmath112 ( figure  [ fig : figure_7_thermodynamic_phase_2 ] , bottom ) with 1% off - gas flow rate .",
    "the pressure stabilization works as efficiently as for the phase-1 setup , stabilizing a few hours after starting the process , as shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig : figure_7_thermodynamic_phase_2 ] .",
    "however , achieving a stable mass - balance is more complex since the final phase-2 setup has a longer package tube and the position of the feeding port , where the xenon is injected to the package tube , was also moved upwards .",
    "the overpressure inside the input condenser is therefore required to be much higher , to push the liquid upwards compared to the phase-1 system .",
    "after about 24 hours , the optimal settings were found and the liquid level inside the reboiler vessel ( @xmath80 , figure  [ fig : figure_7_thermodynamic_phase_2 ] , middle ) remained constant at 6.2 mbar .",
    "the differential pressure along the package tube was measured to be about 2.4 mbar , corresponding to a pressure drop of about 0.86mbar / m , similar to the phase-1 system .        in further distillation studies at lngs , higher flow rates of up to 16.5slpm",
    "were tested by processing xenon with a krypton concentration of @xmath113 .",
    "stable performance was achieved , verifying the results from the commissioning in mnster , using flow rates of up to 18slpm . furthermore , highly contaminated xenon with @xmath114 and @xmath115 was successfully processed .",
    "the studies indicate that the modifications of the gas collection in both input and top condenser were successful and allow processing xenon with a high content of impurities other than krypton .      during the commissioning run at wwu mnster ,",
    "xenon artificially doped to a krypton concentration of @xmath111 was used to estimate the reduction factor of the phase-2 column with the coldtrap - rga method .",
    "both the in - gas sample and the purified liquid - out gas were measured during the distillation process with 8.0slpm .",
    "the concentration of natural krypton in the purified xenon was found to be below the sensitivity limit of the coldtrap - rga system of @xmath116 .",
    "the concentration in the supply bottle was determined to be @xmath117 .",
    "this gives a reduction factor of @xmath118 almost reaching the design value of 10@xmath119 - 10@xmath120 .    during the commissioning run at lngs ,",
    "212 kg of xenon were processed ( see figure  [ fig : figure_7_thermodynamic_phase_2 ] ) , and several samples for measurements with the rgms system were drawn . the in - gas was stored in four gas bottles .",
    "three of them were measured with a commercial gas - chromatograph and have an average concentration of @xmath121 . for the fourth bottle",
    "a certificate from the delivering company stated a concentration of less than 1000ppb of krypton .",
    "the sample container for the purified xenon was connected to the xenon1 t purification system , which is designed as a gas manifold and allows extraction of samples .",
    "the purified liquid - out sample was measured to have a concentration of @xmath122 .",
    "assuming a uniform distribution for the unknown concentration of the fourth bottle between 0ppb and 1000ppb , the reduction factor is @xmath123 systematic effects affecting sample collection , transport and preparation potentially contaminate the liquid - out sample .",
    "the absolute concentration in the liquid - out line during the distillation process may be lower and thus the reduction might be even higher .",
    "absolute concentrations below @xmath124 ( 90@xmath39cl ) were achieved with the final system when distilling xenon with input concentrations of about @xmath125 during further distillation runs .",

    "a novel distillation column was designed and constructed for a process speed of 8.3slpm ( @xmath1333kg / h ) and a krypton reduction factor of more than @xmath134 to reach natural krypton in xenon concentrations on the ppq level .",
    "the development was done in two phases , starting with a first setup using 1.1 m of package material ( phase-1 ) .",
    "it was followed by the improved final setup ( phase-2 ) , using 2.8 m of package material , currently installed in the underground laboratory lngs as a subsystem of the xenon1 t experiment .",
    "both systems are thermodynamically stable at the design values .",
    "higher process speeds of up to 18slpm ( @xmath1336.5kg / h ) were also shown to be stable .",
    "the separation performance was investigated using different coldtrap rga and rgms techniques and the reduction factor of the final setup at lngs has been measured to be @xmath135 .",
    "the krypton concentrations delivered by the final system were measured to be below 48ppq , fulfilling the xenon1 t requirement of @xmath7200ppq .",
    "the lowest concentration so far was below 26ppq , obtained with the phase-1 column , and is almost an order of magnitude lower than needed for xenon1 t .",
    "the cryogenic distillation column is being operated at the xenon1 t experiment and allows for processing 3.3tons of xenon to produce an ultra - low krypton contamination at the ppq - level .",
