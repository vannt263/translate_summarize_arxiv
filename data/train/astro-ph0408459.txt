    "soon after the discovery of millisecond pulsars ( backer et al .  1982 ) , it was suggested ( alpar et al .",
    "1982 ; radhakrishnan and srinivasan 1982 ) that they have been recycled by being spun up by accretion of angular momentum in low - mass x - ray binary systems ( lmxbs ) .",
    "although this picture has been widely accepted for more than two decades ( see bhattacharya 1995 ) , until the last few years there was only indirect evidence that neutron stars in lmxbs have the spin rates and magnetic fields required for them to be the progenitors of the rotation - powered millisecond pulsars ( msps ) .",
    "the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) has transformed the situation by revealing that accreting neutron stars in lmxbs produce three distinct types of millisecond x - ray oscillations that can be used to determine their spins and estimate their magnetic fields .",
    "all three types of oscillation are thought to be generated directly or indirectly by the star s magnetic field and spin .",
    "together , they provide strong evidence that more than two dozen neutron stars in lmxbs have the millisecond spin periods and @xmath710@xmath810@xmath9  g magnetic fields necessary for them to become rotation - powered msps when accretion ceases .",

    "the spin frequencies of these accretion - powered msps range from 185  hz to 435  hz .    nearly periodic x - ray oscillations have been detected during thermonuclear bursts of 13 neutron stars in lmxbs , including 2 of the 5 known accretion - powered msps ( table  1 ) .",

    "pairs of accretion - powered kilohertz quasi - periodic x - ray oscillations have been detected in more than two dozen accreting neutron stars ( see lamb 2003 ) , including 8 nuclear - powered msps and 2 of the 5 known accretion - powered msps ( table  1 ) .",
    "the frequencies of these kilohertz qpos range from @xmath7100  hz to @xmath71300  hz , showing that accreting gas orbits close to the surfaces of these stars and that they have magnetic fields @xmath14@xmath15  g ( mlp98 ) .",
    "the separation of the two qpos remains constant to within a few tens of hz as their frequencies vary by as much as a factor of 5 and is commensurate with the spin frequency of the star ( see  2 ) , showing that the star s spin plays a central role in generating the qpo pair and indicating that the magnetic fields of these stars are @xmath16  g. the spin frequencies of the stars that produce kilohertz qpos can be inferred directly from the frequency of their periodic x - ray oscillations , if they have been detected , or indirectly from the separation of their kilohertz qpos , if they have not .",
    "the spins of the neutron stars in which periodic x - ray oscillations and kilohertz qpos have both been detected range from 191  hz to 619  hz ( table  1 ) .",
    "these discoveries have established that many neutron stars in lmxbs have magnetic fields and spin rates similar to those of the rotation - powered msps .",
    "the similarity of these stars to rotation - powered msps strongly supports the hypothesis that they are the progenitors of rotation - powered msps . after being spun down by rotation - powered emission",
    ", the neutron stars in these systems are spun up to millisecond periods by accretion of matter from their binary companions , eventually becoming nuclear- and accretion - powered msps and then , when accretion ends , rotation - powered msps .    in @xmath172",
    "we describe in more detail the new evidence that many neutron stars in lmxbs have millisecond spin periods and dynamically important magnetic fields . in @xmath173",
    "we discuss the spin evolution of weak - field neutron stars in lmxbs , including the long - standing idea that their spin rates are limited by coupling of their magnetic fields to the surrounding accretion disk and recent proposals that their spin rates may be affected by gravitational radiation by the spinning star . in @xmath174",
    "we summarize the implications of the new evidence for the evolution of neutron stars in lmxbs and formation of rotation - powered msps via recycling .",
    "neutron stars in lmxbs are accreting gas from a keplerian disk fed by a low - mass companion star .",
    "the star s magnetic field and accretion rate are thought to be the most important factors that determine the accretion flow pattern near it and the spectral and temporal characteristics of its x - ray emission ( see mlp98 ) .",
    "the accretion rates of these stars vary with time and can range from the eddington critical rate @xmath3 to less than @xmath18 .",
    "their magnetic fields are thought to range from @xmath19  g down to @xmath20  g or possibly less .",
    "magnetic fields at the upper end of this range are strong enough to terminate the keplerian disk well above the stellar surface , even for accretion rates @xmath21 , whereas magnetic fields at the lower end of this range affect the flow only close to the star , even for accretion rates as low as @xmath22 .    for intermediate field strengths and accretion rates ,",
    "some of the accreting gas is expected to couple to the star s magnetic field well above the stellar surface and be funneled toward the magnetic poles , heating the stellar surface unevenly .",
    "the remainder of the accreting gas is expected to remain in a geometrically thin keplerian flow that penetrates close to the stellar surface , as shown in figure  1 .",
    "this flow is thought to be responsible for generating the kilohertz qpos ( see lamb & miller 2001 ; lamb 2003 ; lamb & miller 2004 ) .",
    "recent observations ( see below ) show that x - ray bursts also heat the stellar surface unevenly , and that the regions heated in this way are coupled to the rotation of the star , probably via the star s magnetic field . whether due to accretion or to nuclear burning , uneven heating of the stellar surface produces a broad pattern of x - ray emission .",
    "rotation of this pattern makes both the accretion - powered and nuclear - powered x - ray emission of the star appear to oscillate at its spin frequency .",
    "a breakthrough was achieved during the past year with the detection of burst oscillations in the accretion - powered msps ( chakrabarty et al .",
    "2003 ) and ( strohmayer et al .  2003 ) and precise measurements of the frequencies and phases of these oscillations .",
    "the new results show that , except during the first seconds of some bursts , _ the burst oscillations of these stars have the same frequency and phase as their coherent accretion - powered oscillations _ ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , establishing beyond any doubt that ( 1 )  these stars have magnetic fields strong enough to channel the accretion flow and enforce corotation of the gas heated by nuclear burning and ( 2 )  the nuclear- and accretion - powered oscillations are both produced by spin modulation of the x - ray flux from the stellar surface .",
    "the burst oscillations of some other stars are very stable ( strohmayer & markwardt 2002 ) , but many show frequency drifts and phase jitter ( strohmayer et al .  1996 ; strohmayer et al .",
    "1998 ; muno , fox , & morgan 2000 ; muno et al .",
    "the new results confirm that burst and persistent oscillations both reveal directly the spin frequency of the star .",
    "the 16 msp spins measured to date are consistent with a uniform distribution that ends abruptly at 760  hz ( chakrabarty et al .",
    "2003 ) , but they are also consistent with a distribution that decreases more gradually .",
    "the proportion of accretion- and nuclear - powered msps with frequencies higher than 500  hz is greater than the proportion of known rotation - powered msps with such high frequencies , probably because there is no bias against detecting accretion - powered msps with high frequencies , whereas detection of rotation - powered msps with high frequencies is still difficult ( see chakrabarty et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "seven of the 16 known msps in lmxbs have frequencies @xmath23  hz , whereas none of the accretion - powered msps have frequencies this high ( see table  1 ) . although the current sample is too small to draw a conclusion , _ such a trend is to be expected if many of these msps are near accretion spin equilibrium , because pulsars with stronger magnetic fields should produce stronger oscillations and have lower equilibrium spin rates , other things being equal ( see  3)_.    classic kilohertz qpo pairs have been discovered in two accretion - powered msps , xte  j1807.4@xmath24294 ( markwardt et al .",
    "2003a ) and sax  j1808.4@xmath243658 ( wijnands et al .  2003",
    "; see fig .",
    "the frequency separation of the qpo pair is consistent with the spin frequency of xte  j1807.4 but with half the spin frequency of sax  j1808.4 .",
    "the kilohertz qpo separation is consistent with the spin frequency or half of it in all stars in which burst oscillations have been detected ( see lamb & miller 2004 ; lamb 2005 ) .",
    "these discoveries demonstrate conclusively that some kilohertz qpo sources have dynamically important magnetic fields and that the spin of the star plays a central role in generating the qpo pair , confirming two important predictions of the sonic - point beat - frequency model ( mlp98 ) .",
    "but they also show that the original model is incorrect or at least incomplete , because it can not explain a frequency separation equal to _ half _ the spin frequency ( lamb & miller 2004 ) .",
    "a modified version of the sonic - point beat - frequency model ( lamb & miller 2004 ; lamb 2005 ) attributes the lower kilohertz qpo to interaction of x - rays from the stellar surface with vertical motions of gas in the disk excited by the star s radiation or magnetic field at the radius where its spin frequency resonates with the vertical epicyclic frequency .",
    "the lowest - order linear resonance of this type would generate vertical oscillations with half the spin frequency and could produce qpo frequency separations equal to the star s spin frequency or half of it ( lamb & miller 2004 ; lamb 2005 ) .",
    "the new results exclude models ( see lamb 2003 ) in which the frequencies of the kilohertz qpos are various relativistic precession frequencies because spin frequencies several times higher than those observed would be required and because such models can not explain the commensurability of the frequency separation of the qpos with the stellar spin frequency ( lamb 2003 ; lamb 2005 ) .",
    "_ current spins of neutron stars in lmxbs_.accretion from a disk will spin up a slowly - rotating neutron star on the spin - relaxation timescale ( ghosh & lamb 1979 , hereafter gl79 ; ghosh & lamb 1992 , hereafter gl92 ; lamb & yu 2004 ) @xmath25 \\sim 10 ^ 8 \\ , { \\rm yr}\\ , \\left ( \\frac{\\nu_{\\rm spin}}{\\rm 300~hz } \\right )   \\left ( \\frac{\\dot m } { 0.01{\\dot m}_e } \\right)^{-1+\\alpha/3}\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath10 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 are the star s spin , mass , and moment of inertia , @xmath28 is the accretion rate onto the star ( not the mass transfer rate ) , @xmath29 is the angular momentum coupling radius , @xmath30 is 0.23 if the inner disk is radiation - pressure - dominated ( rpd ) or 0.38 if it is gas - pressure - dominated ( gpd ) , and in the last expression on the right the weak dependence of @xmath31 on @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and the star s magnetic field has been neglected .",
    "the current spin rates of neutron stars in lmxbs reflect the average accretion torque over a period @xmath32 or longer . determining this average torque",
    "is complicated by the fact that the accretion rates and magnetic fields of these stars vary with time by large factors and that the torque can decrease as well as increase the spin rate . while a few neutron stars in lmxbs accrete steadily at rates @xmath21 , most accrete at rates @xmath33@xmath34 ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ; lamb 1989 ; van den heuvel 1992 ; mlp98 ) and many accrete only episodically ( van den heuvel 1992 ; ritter & king 2001 ) .",
    "the recently - discovered accretion - powered msps in lmxbs have outbursts only every few years , during which their accretion rates rise to @xmath35 for a few weeks before falling again to @xmath36 ( see chakrabarty et al .",
    "2003 ; strohmayer et al .",
    "2003 ) . also , there is strong evidence that the magnetic fields of neutron stars in lmxbs decrease by factors @xmath37@xmath38 during accretion , perhaps on timescales as short as hundreds of years ( see shibazaki et al .",
    "1999 ; bhattacharya & srinivasan 1995 ) .",
    "if a star s magnetic field and accretion rate are constant , accretion will spin it up on a timescale @xmath32 to its equilibrium spin frequency @xmath39 .",
    "this frequency depends on @xmath26 , the strength and structure of the star s magnetic field , the thermal structure of the disk at @xmath29 , and @xmath28 ( gl79 ; white & stella 1987 ; gl92 ) .",
    "if a star s magnetic field and accretion rate change on timescales longer than @xmath31 , the spin frequency will approach @xmath39 and track it as it changes . if instead @xmath28 varies on timescales shorter than @xmath31 , the spin rate will fluctuate about the appropriate average value of @xmath39 ( see elsner , ghosh , & lamb 1980 ) .",
    "thus @xmath39 and its dependence on @xmath40 and @xmath28 provide a framework for analyzing the evolution of the spins of neutron stars in lmxbs .",

    "the disk is gpd at @xmath29 even if the star s magnetic field is @xmath46  g. the effects of the stellar surface and the innermost stable circular orbit ( lamb & yu 2004 ) are not shown .",

    "alternatively , these stars may have stopped accreting before reaching spin equilibrium or been spun down as accretion ended .",
    "based on the limited information then available , some authors ( bildsten 1998 ; ushomirsky , cutler , & bildsten 2000 ) speculated that neutron stars in lmxbs have negligible magnetic fields and spin frequencies in a narrow range , with many within 20% of 300  hz .",
    "such a distribution would be difficult to explain by accretion torques and was taken as evidence that gravitational radiation plays an important role .",
    "we now know ( see  2 ) that most if not all neutron stars in lmxbs have dynamically important magnetic fields , that the observed spins of neutron stars in lmxbs are approximately uniformly distributed from @xmath51  hz to @xmath52  hz , and that production of gravitational radiation by uneven heating of the crust or excitation of @xmath53-waves is not as easy as was originally thought ( ushomirsky et al .  2000",

    "production of millisecond rotation - powered pulsars_.the initial proposals that neutron stars are spun up to millisecond periods by accretion in lmxbs assumed that they accrete at rates @xmath54 throughout their accretion phase ( see bhattacharya & van den heuvel 1991 ) and implicitly that accretion then ends suddenly ; otherwise the stars would track @xmath39 to low spin rates as accretion ends .",
    "this simplified picture is sometimes still used ( see , e.g. , arzoumanian , cordes , & wasserman 1999 ) , but  as noted above  most neutron stars in lmxbs accrete at rates @xmath55 and many accrete only episodically .",
    "the real situation is therefore more complex .",
    "the initial spins of rotation - powered msps recycled in lmxbs are the spins of their progenitors when they stopped accreting .",
    "these spins depend sensitively on the magnetic fields and the appropriately averaged accretion rates of the progenitors when accretion ends .",
    "comparison of the equilibrium spin - period curves for a range of accretion rates with the @xmath4@xmath5 distribution of known rotation - powered msps ( fig .",
    "4 ) suggests four important conclusions :    ( 1 )  the overall @xmath4@xmath5 distribution is consistent with the distribution expected for spin - up to accretion spin - equilibrium and generally supports the models of disk accretion by weak - field neutron stars used .",
    "in particular , the observed @xmath4@xmath5 distribution is consistent with the predicted distribution only if the accretion torque vanishes at a spin frequency close to the predicted @xmath39 .",
    "( 2 )  the accretion spin - equilibrium hypothesis predicts that msps should not be found above the spin - equilibrium line for @xmath56 and @xmath57 , because this is a bounding case .",
    "the observed @xmath4@xmath5 distribution is consistent with the rpd model of the inner disk that was used for @xmath58 , except for two pulsars discovered very recently in globular clusters ( [ lower - left ] and [ upper - right ] ; hobbs et al .  2004 ) .",
    "either the intrinsic @xmath59 s of these pulsars are lower than shown or the rpd model of the inner disk does not accurately describe the accretion flow that spun up these stars .",
    "( 3 )  the accretion spin - equilibrium hypothesis predicts that msps should be rare or absent below the spin - equilibrium line for @xmath60 , because stars accreting at such low rates generally will not achieve spin equilibrium during their accretion phase .",
    "the observed @xmath4@xmath5 distribution is consistent with this prediction .",
    "( 4 )  the msps near the 15  gyr spin - down line were produced _ in situ _ by final accretion rates @xmath61 rather than by spin - up to shorter periods by accretion at rates @xmath62 followed by magnetic braking , because braking would take too long .",
    "this result accords with the expectation ( see above ) that most neutron stars in lmxbs accrete at rates @xmath55 toward the end of their accretion phase .",
