    ", one can see several general features that are irrespective of @xmath30 .",
    "firstly , all the energy spectra consist of two isolated subbands , because of the repulsion effects between the two chains driven by the large interchain hopping integral @xmath93 [ eq .  ( [ eq9 ] ) ]",
    ". and these two subbands are exactly the propagating channels of the two - leg ladder . secondly",
    ", there exist many sharp peaks in the curve @xmath53-@xmath1 due to the highly fractal energy band of the aa model .",
    "this feature can be further identified in the density of states ( dos ) [ see the dotted line in fig .

    "fig : two](a ) ] . here , we emphasize that the dos profile does not change with the system length @xmath24 when the two - leg ladder is sufficiently long .",
    "the origin of the extremely fractal energy spectrum can be also understood as follows : the aa model can be projected from the 2d square lattice which develops degenerate landau energy levels in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field.@xcite    in the absence of @xmath30 , the two subbands are almost symmetric with respect to @xmath94 and the two - leg ladder exhibits insulating behavior with @xmath95 and @xmath96 [ see the solid line and the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : two](a ) ] , although all electronic states of the first aa chain are delocalized ( @xmath87 ) , consistent with previous study that the system composed of one disordered chain and another completely ordered chain is localized.@xcite this is attributed to the fact that when an electron is injected into the first chain , it will be continuously scattered from larger ( localized ) potentials of the second chain , owing to the interchain hopping integral .",
    "the longer the system is , the more the scattering the electron suffers .",
    "accordingly , @xmath42 will be exponentially declined to zero with increasing @xmath24 , a typical feature of anderson localization .    while in the presence of @xmath30 that could lead to electron - hole asymmetry , the two subbands become asymmetric and opposite behaviors",
    "could be observed with increasing @xmath30 . for the left subband ,",
    "its bandwidth decreases monotonically from @xmath97 at @xmath80 to @xmath98 at @xmath82 and @xmath53 is gradually declined by increasing @xmath30 , and hence the electronic states become more localized . in contrast",
    ", the bandwidth of the right subband is enhanced from @xmath97 at @xmath80 to @xmath99 at @xmath82 and @xmath53 increases with @xmath30 , and nonzero conductance could emerge in the region of large @xmath30 [ see the insets of figs .  [",
    "fig : two](b ) and [ fig : two](c ) ] .",
    "this phenomenon can be explained as follows .",
    "in fact , the nnn hopping integral could produce additional two propagating channels with opposite sign of hopping integrals [ eq .  ( [ eq10 ] ) ] and thus affects the transport properties of the two - leg ladder by mixing these channels with the original ones at @xmath80 .",
    "when the hopping integrals of the additional and original propagating channels are of different signs , the effective hopping integral will be reduced and leads to the shrink of both the bandwidth and the localization length .",
    "contrarily , when they have identical sign , the effective hopping integral can be enhanced and both the bandwidth and the localization length can be increased , leading to a possible mit in the two - leg ladder .",
    "actually , the electronic states of finite conductance observed in the insets of figs .  [ fig : two](b ) and [ fig : two](c ) are delocalized even in the thermodynamic limit , because the conductance of the localized states presents exponential dependence on the system length and should be zero when @xmath83 .",

[",

    "the small @xmath107 in these corners may originate from the fact that : ( 1 ) the qp character of the system is not obvious for short system length @xmath109 when @xmath3 is very close to an integer ; ( 2 ) the electronic states in the band edge are isolated from others and can not form a band , and thus become fragile .",

    "for instance , the ratio of the difference between @xmath123 at @xmath160 and its saturated value to the saturated value is 0.08% , where the saturated value of @xmath123 is prescribed at @xmath161 . here ,",

    "this point is contrary to the scaling theory of localization that the scaling function should be less than @xmath48 for the 2d disordered systems.@xcite the underlying physics can be attributed to the fact that the system we studied is qp but not disordered . in this situation , the delocalized channels as well as their conductances will be increased by increasing @xmath24",
    ".    however , there exists fluctuation in the curve @xmath162 , especially in the regime of small conductance .",

    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : eight](a ) that the distribution of @xmath140 is extremely complicated and is not normal , which is different from previous studies in disordered systems.@xcite because of the cosine modulation of the on - site energies and the quasiperiodicity , we find that the conductance presents oscillating behavior with various amplitudes when the sample is successively chosen from an infinite aa chain by using the sliding window strategy ( data not shown ) .",

    "it can be also observed that @xmath168 becomes greater when @xmath169 is larger , indicating that the fluctuation of the conductance will be stronger for larger conductance .",
    "( 2 ) @xmath168 is enhanced by increasing @xmath24 around the band center , where the conductance increases with @xmath24 [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : six](a ) ] and the system presents metallic behavior .",
    "this is different from the universal conductance fluctuation theory that @xmath168 should be independent of the system size .",
    "( 3 ) there are several dips in the profile of @xmath172 , similar to that observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : six](a ) .",
    "in summary , we investigate the localization phase transition and the scaling properties of both quasi - one - dimensional and two - dimensional quasiperiodic systems , which are constructed by coupling several aubry - andr chains along the transverse direction . by employing the landauer - bttiker formula and recursive green s function method ,",
    "the two - terminal conductance is calculated for the quasiperiodic systems with next - nearest - neighbor hopping .",
    "the numerical results indicate that a metal - insulator transition could be produced in these quasiperiodic systems in parameter space by adjusting the next - nearest - neighbor hopping integral and the number of chains .",
    "these results are general and hold by coupling distinct aa chains with different strengths of the on - site potentials and other model parameters .",
    "we find that the energy spectrum of the two - leg ladder model exhibits two hofstadter - like butterflies .",
    "besides , we show from the finite - size scaling that the transport properties of the two - dimensional quasiperiodic system can be described by the single thouless conductance and the scaling function can reach the value 1 , contrary to the scaling theory of localization .",
