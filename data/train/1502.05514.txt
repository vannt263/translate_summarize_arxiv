    "some of these anomalous diffusions ( such as sub - diffusions ) can be described by the so - called fractional order diffusion processes . as for the term",

    "one is the equation of the form @xmath10 , where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 is a positive number , @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the laplacian .",
    "this equation is not associated with the anomalous diffusion .",
    "instead , it is associated with the so - called stable process ( or in general lvy process ) , which has jumps .",
    "another equation is of the form @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the caputo fractional derivative with respect to @xmath3 ( see @xcite for the study of various fractional derivatives ) .",
    "this equation is relevant to the anomalous diffusion which we mentioned and has been studied by a number of researchers , see for example @xcite and the references therein .",
    "if one considers the anomalous diffusion in a random environment , then it is naturally led to the study of a fractional order stochastic partial differential equation of the form @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a second order differential operator , including the laplacian as a special example , and @xmath20 is a noise . in this paper , we shall study this fractional order stochastic partial differential equation when @xmath21 is a time homogeneous fractional gaussian noise of hurst parameter @xmath22 .",
    "mainly , we shall find a relation between @xmath2 and @xmath8 such that the solution to the above equation has a unique square integrable solution .",
    "if @xmath2 is formally set to @xmath23 , then the above stochastic partial differential equation has been studied in @xcite .",
    "so , our work can be considered as an extension of the work @xcite to the case of fractional diffusion ( in gaussian noisy environment ) .",
