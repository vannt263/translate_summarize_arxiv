    "as first noted by @xcite , asteroids can form prominent groupings in the space of orbital elements .",
    "these groups , nowadays well - known as _ asteroid families _ , are believed to have resulted from catastrophic collisions among asteroids , which lead to the ejection of fragments into nearby heliocentric orbits , with relative velocities much lower than their orbital speeds . to date",
    ", several tens of families have been discovered across the whole asteroid main belt ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "also , families have been identified among the trojans @xcite , and most recently , proposed to exist in the transneptunian region @xcite .",
    "studies of asteroid families are very important for planetary science .",
    "families can be used , e.g.  to understand the collisional history of the asteroid main belt @xcite , the outcomes of disruption events over a size range inaccessible to laboratory experiments ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to understand the mineralogical structure of their parent bodies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the effects of related dust `` showers '' on the earth @xcite .",
    "obtaining the relevant information is , however , not easy .",
    "one of the main complications arises from the fact that the age of a family is , in general , unknown .",
    "thus , accurate dating of asteroid families is an important issue in the asteroid science .",
    "a number of age - determination methods have been proposed so far .",
    "probably the most accurate procedure , particularly suited for young families ( i.e.  age @xmath5myr ) , is to integrate the orbits of the family members backwards in time , until the orbital orientation angles cluster around some value .",
    "as such a conjunction of the orbital elements can occur only immediately after the disruption of the parent body , the time of conjunction indicates the formation time .",
    "the method was successfully applied by @xcite to estimate the ages of the karin cluster ( 5.8@xmath60.2 myr ) and of the veritas family ( 8.3@xmath60.5 myr ) .",
    "this method is however limited to groups of objects residing on regular orbits .    for older families ( i.e.  age @xmath7myr ) , one can make use of the fact that asteroids slowly spread in semi - major axis due to the action of yarkovsky thermal forces @xcite .",
    "as small bodies drift faster than large bodies , the distribution of family members in the @xmath8 plane  where @xmath2 is the proper semi - major axis and @xmath9 is the absolute magnitude  can be used as a clock .",
    "that method was used by @xcite to estimate ages of many asteroid families . in these estimations",
    "the initial sizes of the families were neglected , so that this methodology can overestimate the real age by a factor of as much as 1.5 -2 .",
    "an improved version of this method , which accounts for the initial ejection velocity field and the action of yorp thermal torques , has been successfully applied to several families by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "again , it is not straightforward to apply this method to families located in the chaotic regions of the asteroid belt .",
    "@xcite suggested that asteroid families , which reside in chaotic zones , can be approximately dated by _",
    "chaotic chronology_. this method is based on the fact that the age of the family can not be greater than the time needed for its most chaotic members to escape from the family region . in its original form , this method provides only an upper bound for the age .",
    "recently , @xcite introduced an improved version of this method , based on a statistical description of transport in the phase space . @xcite",
    "successfully applied it to the family of ( 490 ) veritas , finding an age of 8.7@xmath61.7  myr , which is statistically the same as that of 8.3@xmath60.5 myr , obtained by @xcite . despite these improvements , the chaotic chronology still suffered from two important limitations",
    "it did not account for the variations in diffusion in different parts of a chaotic zone , which can significantly alter the distribution of family members ( i.e.the shape of the family ) .",
    "moreover , it did not account for yarkovsky / yorp effects , thus being inadequate for the study of older families .",
    "in this paper we extend the chaotic chronology method , by constructing a more advanced transport model , which alleviates the above limitations .",
    "we first use the veritas family as benchmark , since its age can be considered well - defined .",
    "local diffusion coefficients are numerically computed , throughout the region of proper elements occupied by the family .",
    "these local coefficients characterize the efficiency of chaotic transport at different locations within the considered zone .",
    "a monte - carlo - type model is then constructed , in analogy to the one used by @xcite .",
    "the novelty of the present model is that it assumes variable transport coefficients , as well as a drift in semi - major axis due to yarkovsky / yorp effects , although the latter is ignored when studying the veritas family .",
    "applying our model to veritas , we find that both ( a ) the shape of its chaotic component and ( b ) its age are correctly recovered .",
    "we then apply our model to the family of ( 3556 ) lixiaohua , another outer - belt family but much older than veritas and hence much more affected by the yarkovsky / yorp thermal effects .",
    "we find the age of the lixiaohua family to be @xmath10  myr .",
    "we note that , depending on the variability of diffusion coefficients in the considered region of proper elements , this new transport model can be computationally much more expensive than the one applied in @xcite .",
    "this is because , if the values of the diffusion coefficients vary a lot across the considered region , one would have to calculate them in many different points .",
    "however , even so , this computation needs to be performed only once .",
    "then , the random - walk model can be used to perform multiple runs at very low cost , e.g.  to test different hypotheses about the original ejection velocities field or about the physical properties of the asteroids .",
    "on the other hand , for  smooth \" diffusion regions in which the coefficients only change by a factor of 2 - 3 across the considered domain , the model can be simplified . in such regions , the age of a family",
    "can be accurately determined even by assuming an average ( i.e.  constant over the entire region ) diffusion coefficient , as we show in section 3 .",
    "our study begins by selecting the target phase - space region .",
    "this is done by identifying the members of an asteroid family crossed by resonances , from a catalog of numbered asteroids .",
    "apart from the largest hirayama families , for the other smaller and more compact ones , in the current catalog one typically finds up to several hundred members .",
    "thus the chaotic component of the family consists of a few tens to a few hundreds of asteroids .",
    "although this may be adequate to compute the average values of the diffusion coefficients ( as in tsiganis et al .",
    "2007 ) , a detailed investigation of the local diffusion characteristics requires a much larger sample of bodies .",
    "the latter can be obtained by adding in the fictitious bodies , selected in such a way that they occupy the same region of the proper elements space as the real family members .",
    "since we wish to study just these local diffusion properties and the effect of the use of variable coefficients in our chronology method , we are going to follow here this strategy .",
    "the 3-d space of proper elements , occupied by the selected family , is divided into a number of cells .",
    "then , in each cell , the diffusion coefficients are calculated for both relevant action variables , namely @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 denotes jupiter s semi - major axis , @xmath0 the proper eccentricity and @xmath1 the proper inclination of the asteroid ) .",
    "this is done by calculating the time evolution of the mean squared displacement @xmath14 ( i=1,2 ) in each action , the average taken over the set of bodies ( real or fictitious ) that reside in this cell .",
    "the diffusion coefficient is then defined as the least - squares - fit slope of the @xmath15 curve , while the formal error is computed as in @xcite .",
    "the simulation of the spreading of family members in the space of proper actions and the determination of the age of the family is done using a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) technique ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "at each step in the simulation the _ random walkers _ can change their position in all three directions , i.e.  the proper semi - major axis @xmath16 and the two actions @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "although no macroscopic diffusion occurs in proper semi - major axis , the random walker can change its @xmath2 value due to the yarkovsky effect , while the changes in @xmath19 and @xmath20 are controlled by the local values of the diffusion coefficients . in the case of normal diffusion",
    "the transport properties in action space are determined by the solution of the fokker - planck equation ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the mcmc method is in fact equivalent to solving a discretized 2-d fokker - planck equation with variable coefficients , combined here with a 1-d equation for the yarkovsky - induced displacement in @xmath2 .",
    "the latter acts as a _ drift _ term , contributing to the variability of diffusion in @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the rate of change of @xmath2 due to the yarkovsky thermal force , is given by the following equation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) :    @xmath21    where the coefficients @xmath22 and @xmath23 depend on parameters that describe physical and thermal characteristics of the asteroid and @xmath24 denotes the obliquity of the body s spin axis . for km - sized asteroids ,",
    "the drift rate is inversely proportional to their radius .",
    "this simplified yarkovsky model assumes that the asteroid follows a circular orbit , and thus linear analysis can be used to describe heat diffusion across the asteroid s surface .",
    "the obliquity of the spin axis and the angular velocity of rotation ( @xmath25 ) of the asteroid are subject to thermal torques ( yorp ) that change their values with time , according to the following equations :    @xmath26    ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where the functions @xmath27 and @xmath28 describe the mean strength of the yorp torque and depend on the asteroid s surface thermal conductivity @xcite .",
    "the length of the jump in @xmath16 that a random - walker undertakes at each time - step @xmath29 in the mcmc simulation , is determined by equations ( 1)-(2 ) , in their discretized form .",
    "of course , a set of values of the physical parameters must be assigned to each body . as the majority of the veritas family members are of c - type @xcite , while the lixiaohua family members seem to be c / x - type @xcite , the following values for these parameters @xcite",
    "are adopted : thermal conductivity @xmath30 [ w(m k)@xmath31 , specific heat capacity @xmath32[j(kkg)@xmath31 , and the same value for surface and bulk density @xmath33[kgm@xmath34 . in @xcite ,",
    "the geometric albedos ( @xmath35 ) of several veritas and lixiaohua family members are listed , yielding a mean @xmath36 for veritas and @xmath37 for lixiaohua .",
    "the rotation period , @xmath38 , is chosen randomly from a gaussian distribution peaked at @xmath39h , while the distribution of initial obliquities , @xmath24 , is assumed to be uniform . to assign the appropriate values of absolute magnitude @xmath9 to each body",
    ", we need to have an estimate of the cumulative distribution @xmath40 of family members .",
    "a power - law approximation is used ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* )    @xmath41    where @xmath42 depends on the considered interval for @xmath9 ; e.g.   for the veritas family , we find @xmath43 for @xmath44[11.5,13.5 ] and @xmath45 for @xmath44[13.5,15.5 ] . having the values of @xmath9 and @xmath35 ,",
    "the radius @xmath46 of a body can be estimated , using the relation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath47    at each time - step in the mcmc simulation , a random - walker suffers a jump in @xmath17 and @xmath18 , whose length is given by @xmath48 = @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) , where @xmath51 is a random number from a gaussian distribution @xcite .",
    "since the values of the diffusion coefficients @xmath52 vary in space , the maximum allowable jump , for a given @xmath29 , changes from cell to cell . in our simulations , the values of @xmath53 and @xmath54 used for each body , are given by :    @xmath55    where @xmath56 and @xmath57 denote the distances of the random - walker from the two nearest nodes ( left and right ) and @xmath58 and @xmath59 denote the corresponding values of the diffusion coefficients at these nodes.=@xmath60 could be used instead of an arithmetic one ; we actually found negligible differences . ]    for a correct determination of the age of the family , the random walkers have to be placed initially in a region , whose size is as close as possible to the size that the real family members occupied , immediately after the family - forming event .",
    "this is in fact a source of uncertainty for our model . in our calculations we assumed the initial spread of the family in ( @xmath61 ) and ( @xmath62 ) to be accurately represented by a gaussian equivelocity ellipse ( see morbidelli et al .",
    "1995 ) , computed such that ( i ) the spread in @xmath2 of the whole family and ( ii ) the spread in @xmath0 and @xmath63 of family members that follow regular orbits is well reproduced .",
    "in this section we use our model to study the evolution of the chaotic component of two outer - belt asteroid families : ( 490 ) veritas and ( 3556 ) lixiaohua . in both cases , a number of mean motion resonances ( mmr ) cut - through the family , such that a significant fraction of members follow chaotic trajectories . on the other hand ,",
    "their ages differ significantly , according to previous estimates . in this respect ,",
    "the yarkovsky effect can be neglected in the study of veritas , but not in the study of lixiaohua .",
    "we begin by performing an extensive study of the local diffusion properties in the chaotic region of the veritas family .",
    "then , the mcmc model is used to simulate the evolution of the chaotic members and to derive an estimate of the age of the family .",
    "the results are compared to the ones given by the model of @xcite .",
    "finally , we apply the mcmc model to the lixiaohua family and derive estimates of its age , for different values of the yarkovsky - related physical parameters .",
    "the veritas family is a comparatively small and compact outer - belt family , spectroscopically different from the background population of asteroids . in terms of dynamics",
    ", it occupies a very interesting and complex region , crossed by several mean motion resonances .",
    "application of the hierarchical clustering method ( hcm ) @xcite to the astdys catalog of synthetic proper elements ( numbered asteroids http://hamilton.unipi.it/astdys as of december 2007 ) , yields 409 family members , for a velocity cut - off of @xmath64 m  s@xmath65 as in @xcite .",
    "although the family appears now to extend beyond @xmath66au ( see fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] ) , the main dynamical groups remain practically the same ( see tsiganis et al .",
    "2007 , for a detailed description of the groups ) .",
    "since the scope of this paper is to present a refined transport model , we will briefly describe here only the main relevant features , referring to a forthcoming paper for a renewed analysis of the veritas family itself .",
    "the main chaotic zone , where appreciable diffusion in proper elements is observed , is located around @xmath67au ( fig .  1 ) and",
    "is associated with the action of the ( 5,-2,-2 ) three - body mean motion resonance ( mmr ) ; see fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] for the typical short - term evolution of such a resonant asteroid .",
    "the family members that reside in this resonance can disperse over the observed range in @xmath0 and @xmath63 on a @xmath68  myr time - scale .",
    "this is exactly the group of bodies ( group a ) that was used by tsiganis et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , to compute the age of veritas .      as the number of bodies in group a is small",
    ", we need to generate a uniform distribution of fictitious bodies , in order to compute local diffusion coefficients across the observed range in ( @xmath69 ) . for this reason",
    "we start by selecting @xmath70 initial conditions ( fictitious bodies ) , covering the same region as the real veritas family members , in the space of osculating elements .",
    "we note that the actual number of bodies used in the calculations of the coefficients is much smaller than that ( see below ) .",
    "the orbits of the fictitious bodies are integrated for a time - span of 10  myr , using the orbit9 integrator ( version 9e ) , in a model that includes the four major planets ( jupiter to neptune ) as perturbing bodies .",
    "the indirect effect of the inner planets is accounted for by applying a barycentric correction to the initial conditions .",
    "this model is adequate for studying outer - belt asteroids .",
    "note that the integration time used here is in fact longer than the known age of the veritas family .",
    "this is done in order to study the convergence of the computation of the diffusion coefficients , with respect to the integration time - span .    for each body",
    "mean elements are computed on - line , by applying digital filtering , and proper elements are subsequently computed according to the analytical theory of @xcite .",
    "synthetic proper elements @xcite are also calculated , for comparison and control .",
    "since the mapping from osculating to proper elements is not linear , the distribution of the fictitious bodies in the space of proper elements is not uniform , which can complicate the statistics . a smaller sample of @xmath71 bodies , with practically uniform distribution in proper elements ,",
    "is therefore chosen .",
    "thus , our statistical sample , on which all computations are based , is in fact @xmath72 times larger than the actual population of the family .    as explained in the previous section , we computed local diffusion coefficients , by dividing the space occupied by the veritas family in a number of cells .",
    "our preliminary experiments suggested that , while a large number of cells is needed to accurately represent the dependence of the coefficients on @xmath2 , the same is not true for @xmath0 and @xmath73 , except for the wide chaotic zone of the ( @xmath74 ) mmr .",
    "thus , we decided to follow the strategy of using a large number of cells in @xmath2 and a small number of cells in @xmath0 and @xmath63 , except in the ( 5,-2,-2 ) region .",
    "the efficiency of the computation is improved if we use a moving - average technique ( i.e.  overlapping cells ) , instead of a large number of static cells , because in the latter case we would need a significantly larger number of fictitious bodies .",
    "we selected the size of a cell in each dimension as well as an appropriate step - size , by which we shift the cell through the family , as follows : for @xmath16 , the cell - size was @xmath75  au and the step - size @xmath76au ; for @xmath17 the cell - size was @xmath77 and the step - size @xmath78 ; finally , for @xmath18 , the cell - size was @xmath79 and the step - size @xmath80 .",
    "thus , the total number of ( overlapping ) cells used in our computations was @xmath81 .",
    "the time evolution of the mean squared displacement in @xmath19 and @xmath20 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] , for a representative cell in the ( 5,-2,-2 ) resonance .",
    "the evolution is basically linear in time , as it should be for normal diffusion .",
    "the slope of the fitted line defines the value of the local diffusion coefficient .",
    "when performing such computations , one needs to know ( i ) what is the shortest possible integration time - span , and ( ii ) what is the smallest possible number of fictitious bodies per cell , for which reliable values of the coefficients can be obtained . for several different groups of fictitious bodies ( i.e.  different cells ) , we calculated the diffusion coefficients using different values of the integration time - span , between 1 and 10  myr .",
    "our results suggest , that an integration time of @xmath82myr is sufficient to obtain reliable values , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig04 ] .",
    "saturation time _ is about half the known age of the veritas family .",
    "hence , for this case , computing diffusion coefficients is practically as expensive as studying the evolution of the family by long - term integrations .",
    "however , the saturation time is related to the resonance in question and not to the age of the family , which could be much longer .",
    "thus , as a matter of principle , the computational gain can become important when dealing with much older families .",
    "resonances of similar order are characterized by similar lyapunov and diffusion times ( see @xcite ) , and thus similar computation time - spans ( i.e.  a few myr ) should be used , for various resonances throughout the belt .",
    "the dependence of the diffusion coefficients on the number of bodies considered in each cell was also tested . for a number of different cells , we calculated the coefficients , using from 10 to 100 bodies for the computation of the corresponding averages .",
    "our results suggest that at least @xmath83 bodies per cell are needed , for an accurate computation .",
    "the values of the diffusion coefficients in @xmath19 and @xmath20 , along with their formal errors , are given as functions of @xmath2 in fig.[fig05 ] .",
    "the largest diffusion rate is measured in the ( 5,-2,-2 ) mmr , which cuts through the family at @xmath84au . both coefficients increase as the center of the resonance",
    "is approached , but show local minima at @xmath853.174  au , which is approximately the location of the center .",
    "the maximum values are @xmath53 = ( 1.28@xmath86)@xmath87  yr@xmath65 , and @xmath54 = ( 1.36@xmath86)@xmath87  yr@xmath65 , while the values at the local minima are @xmath53 = ( 0.73@xmath88)@xmath89  yr@xmath65 , and @xmath54 = ( 1.16@xmath86)@xmath89  yr@xmath65 .",
    "this form of dependence in @xmath2 is in agreement with the results of @xcite , where it was shown that the dynamics in this resonance are similar to those of a modulated pendulum ( see also @xcite ) , with an island of regular motion persisting at the center of the resonance .",
    "however , the size of the island decreases with decreasing @xmath90 , so that the diffusion coefficients may decrease as the resonance center is approached , but do not go to zero .    as also seen in fig .",
    "[ fig05 ] , the ( 5,-2,-2 ) is by far the most important resonance in the veritas region , associated with the widest chaotic zone .",
    "bodies inside this resonance exhibit a complex behaviour , as already noted by @xcite .",
    "most resonant bodies show oscillations in proper semi - major axis around @xmath16 = 3.174  au , but some are temporarily trapped near the resonance s borders ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] ) , at @xmath16 = 3.172  au or @xmath16 = 3.1755  au .",
    "this `` stickiness '' can be important , as it can affect the diffusion rate .",
    "in fact , we find that the @xmath2 values of these bodies shift towards the resonance borders , where slower diffusion rates are also measured .",
    "the diffusion properties are quite different at the ( 3,3,-2 ) ( located at @xmath91au ) and ( 7,-7,-2 ) ( at @xmath92au ) mmrs , which are of higher order in eccentricity with respect to the ( 5,-2,-2 ) mmr ( see nesvorn & morbidelli 1999 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath53 for the ( 3,3,-2 ) resonance ( see fig .  [",
    "fig05]a ) are also increasing as the center of the resonance is approached , but no local minimum is seen near the center of the resonance , at least in this resolution .",
    "the maximum values are only @xmath53 = ( 8.30@xmath93)@xmath94  yr@xmath65 and @xmath54 = ( 0.22@xmath95)@xmath94  yr@xmath65 , clearly much smaller than in the ( 5,-2,-2 ) mmr .",
    "note that @xmath54 has practically zero value .",
    "the region of the ( 7,-7,-2 ) resonance is even less exciting .",
    "@xmath53 is almost constant across the resonance , with a very small value ( 4.1@xmath96  yr@xmath65 ) , and @xmath54 is practically zero .",
    "the above results suggest that the ( 5,-2,-2 ) mmr is essentially the only resonance in the veritas region characterized by appreciable macroscopic diffusion .",
    "we now focus on the variation of the diffusion coefficients with respect to @xmath97 along this resonance . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig06 ] , the dependence of the diffusion rate on the initial values of the actions and @xmath18 and then translated into proper elements space . ]",
    "is very complex .",
    "the values of @xmath53 vary from ( 0.60@xmath98)@xmath89  yr@xmath65 to ( 1.66@xmath86)@xmath87  yr@xmath65 while , for @xmath54 , they vary from ( 0.63@xmath99)@xmath89  yr@xmath65 to ( 2.31@xmath95)@xmath87  yr@xmath65 .",
    "consequently , chaotic diffusion along this resonance can in principle produce asymmetric `` tails '' in the distribution of group - a members .",
    "note , however , that the coefficients only vary by a factor of @xmath100 and that their average values are essentially the same as in @xcite .",
    "we can now use the mcmc method to simulate the evolution and determine the age of the veritas family , assuming that all the dynamically distinct groups originated from a single brake - up event .",
    "a set of six values ( @xmath16,@xmath17,@xmath18,@xmath38,@xmath24,@xmath9 ) is assigned to each random walker in the simulation .",
    "all bodies are initially distributed uniformly inside a region of predefined size in @xmath101 and semi - major axes in the range [ 3.172 , 3.176 ] .",
    "the age of the family , ( @xmath102 ) , is defined as the time needed for @xmath103 of the random walkers to leave an ellipse in the ( @xmath104 ) plane , corresponding to a 3-@xmath105 confidence interval of a 2-d gaussian distribution .",
    "we note that , for veritas , the mobility in semi - major axis due to yarkovsky is very small and practically insignificant for what concerns the estimation of its age , since the family is young and distant from the sun . for older families",
    "one should also define appropriate borders in @xmath2 .    using the values of the coefficients obtained above , and the values of @xmath106=(@xmath107)@xmath108 , @xmath109=(@xmath110)@xmath108 , calculated from the distribution of the real group a members , we simulate the spreading of group a and estimate its age .",
    "of course , the model depends on some free parameters : the initial spread of the group in ( @xmath111 , @xmath112 ) , the time - step , @xmath29 , and the number of random - walkers , @xmath113 .",
    "therefore , the dependence of the age , @xmath102 , on these parameters was checked .",
    "uncertainties in the values of the current borders of the group ( i.e.  the confidence ellipse ) and the values of the diffusion coefficients were taken into account , when calculating the formal error in @xmath102 .",
    "different sets of simulations were performed , the results of which are given in fig .",
    "[ fig07](a)-(d ) .",
    "each `` simulation '' ( i.e.  each point in a plot ) actually consists of 100 different realizations ( runs ) of the mcmc code . in each run , the values of @xmath52 and @xmath105(@xmath114 ) were varied , according to the previously computed distributions of their values .",
    "the values of the free parameters were the same for all runs in a given simulation .",

    "six simulations were performed , with @xmath112 ranging from 3.5 @xmath108 to 11.0@xmath108 , and the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig07]c .",
    "the values of @xmath102 tend to decrease as @xmath112 increases .",
    "this is to be expected , since increasing the initial spread of the family , while targeting for the same final spread , should take a shorter time for a given diffusion rate .",
    "the results yield @xmath102 = 8.8@xmath61.1  myr .    as a final check",
    ", we performed a set of simulations with @xmath111 = 2.3@xmath108 and @xmath112 = 11.0@xmath120 .",
    "these values correspond to equivelocity ellipses that contain almost all regular and ( 3,3,-2)-resonant family members , except for the very low inclination bodies ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "five sets of runs , for five different values of @xmath29 , were performed ( see fig .",
    "[ fig07]d ) . as in our first set of simulations ,",
    "@xmath102 is practically independent of @xmath29 . on the other hand , @xmath102 turns out to be smaller than in the previous simulations , since the assumed values for @xmath119 and @xmath112 are quite large .",
    "even so , we find @xmath102 = 7.6@xmath61.1  myr , which is still an acceptable value .",
    "combining the results of the first three sets of simulations and taking into account all uncertainties , we find an age estimate of @xmath102 = 8.7@xmath61.2  myr for the veritas family .",
    "this result is very close to the one found by @xcite , the error though being smaller by @xmath122 .",
    "in addition to the determination of the family s age , we would like to know how well the mcmc model reproduces the evolution of the spread of group - a bodies , in the ( @xmath19,@xmath20 ) space .",
    "for this purpose we compared the evolution of group a for @xmath123myr in the future , as given ( i ) by direct numerical integration of the orbits , and ( ii ) by an mcmc simulation with variable diffusion coefficients .",
    "figures [ fig08](a)-(b ) show the outcome of this comparison . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig08](a ) , the random - walkers of the mcmc simulation ( triangles ) practically cover the same region in ( @xmath19,@xmath20 ) as the real group - a members ( circles ) .",
    "moreover , the time evolution of the ratio of the standard deviations @xmath124 , which characterizes the shape of the distribution , is reproduced quite well , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig08](b ) .",
    "an additional mcmc simulation with constant ( i.e.  average with respect to @xmath0 and @xmath63 ) coefficients of diffusion was also performed .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig08](b ) , the value of @xmath124 in this simulation appears to slowly deviate from the one measured in the previous mcmc simulation , as time progresses .",
    "however , this deviation is not very large , also compared to the result of the numerical integration .",
    "thus , we conclude that an mcmc model with constant coefficients is adequate for deriving a reasonably accurate estimate of the age of a family , provided that the variations of the local diffusion coefficients are not very large . given this result ,",
    "we decided to use average coefficients for the lixiaohua case .",
    "note also that , in the veritas case , the observed deviation in @xmath124 between the two mcmc models is reflected in the error of @xmath102 ( i.e.  1.7  myr vs.1.2  myr ) .",
    "the lixiaohua family is another typical outer - belt family , crossed by several mmrs .",
    "this results into a significant component of family members that follow chaotic trajectories .",
    "at the same time , a clear ` v'-shaped distribution is observed in the @xmath8 plane ( see fig .",
    "[ fig09 ] ) , suggesting that the family is old - enough for yarkovsky to have significantly altered its size in @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite in this way estimated the age of this family to @xmath125myr .",
    "thus , we choose to study the lixiaohua family because , on one hand , it is relatively old , so yarkovsky / yorp effects are important , but , on the other hand , it has the feature we need ( i.e. a significant chaotic zone ) to test the behaviour of our model on longer time scales . here",
    ", we use our mcmc method to derive a more accurate estimate of its age , taking into account also the yarkovsky / yorp effects .    the distribution of the family members in @xmath126 and @xmath127 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig09 ] . using velocity cut - off @xmath128 m  s@xmath65 we find 263 bodies ( database as of february 2009 ) linked to the family .",
    "the shape of this family is , as in the veritas case , intriguing . for @xmath129au",
    ", the family appears to better fit inside the equivelocity ellipse shown in the figure , with only a few bodies showing a significant excursion in @xmath0 and @xmath63 . on the other hand , for @xmath130au ,",
    "the family members occupy a wider area in @xmath0 and @xmath63 . throughout the family region",
    "we find thin , `` vertical '' , strips of chaotic bodies , with lyapunov times @xmath131y .",
    "these strips are associated to different mean motion resonances .",
    "the most important chaotic domain ( hereafter main chaotic zone , mcz ) is the one centered around @xmath132au ; indicated by the grey - shaded area in both plots of fig .",
    "[ fig09 ] .",
    "a number of two- and three - body mmrs can be associated to the formation of the mcz , such as the 17:8 mmr with jupiter and the ( 7 ,  9 ,  -5 ) three - body mmr .",
    "note that the two largest members of this family , ( 3330 ) gantrisch and ( 5900 ) jensen , are located just outside the mcz , as indicated by their larger values of @xmath133 ( @xmath134y ) .",
    "in fact , a significant group of bodies just outside the mcz ( see fig .  [",
    "fig09]a ) has higher values of @xmath133 but similar spread in @xmath0 as the mcz bodies .",
    "this suggests that bodies around the chaotic zone could have once resided therein , evolving towards high / low values of @xmath0 by chaotic diffusion .",
    "numerical integrations of the orbits of selected lixiaohua members for 100  myr indeed confirmed that bodies could enter ( or leave ) the mcz .",
    "we believe that the distribution of family members on either side of the mcz is strongly indicative of an interplay between yarkovsky drift in semi - major axis and chaotic diffusion in @xmath0 and @xmath63 , induced by the overlapping resonances ; bodies can be forced to cross the mcz , thus receiving a `` kick '' in @xmath0 and @xmath63 , before exiting on the other side of the zone .",
    "a population of @xmath135 fictitious bodies was selected and used for calculation of the local diffusion coefficients . here , we restrict ourselves in calculating coefficients as functions of @xmath2 only ( i.e.  averaged in @xmath0 and @xmath63 ) . as shown in fig.[fig10 ] , there are several diffusive zones , corresponding to the low-@xmath133 strips of fig .",
    "[ fig09 ] .",
    "however , as in the veritas case , only one zone appears diffusive in both actions ; @xmath136 is practically zero everywhere outside the mcz ( @xmath137au ) , and significant dispersion in proper elements is observed only in this zone .    given the above results , we conclude that the mcz family members can be used to estimate the age of the family , much like the veritas ( 5,-2,-2 ) resonant bodies .",
    "given the fact that random - walkers can drift in @xmath2 , the way of computing the age is accordingly modified .",
    "a large number of random walkers , uniformly distributed across the whole family region ( i.e.  the equivelocity ellipses ) is used .",
    "the simulation again stops when @xmath138 of mcz - bodies are found to be outside the observed @xmath139 borders of the family .",
    "however , the number of mcz bodies is not constant during the simulation , because bodies initially outside ( resp .",
    "inside ) the mcz can enter ( resp .",
    "leave ) that region .",
    "thus , the aforementioned percentage is calculated with respect to the corresponding number of mcz bodies at each time - step .",
    "the size of the mcz in the space of proper actions is given by @xmath140 and @xmath141 . in order to compute the age of the family we performed 2400 mcmc runs .",
    "this was repeated three times , for three different values of thermal conductivity ( see above ) and once more , neglecting the yarkovsky effect .",
    "given the uncertainty in determining the initial size of the family , we repeated the computations for two more sets of @xmath142 .",
    "the results of these computations are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] .",
    "we find an upper limit of @xmath143  myr for the age of the family and a lower limit of @xmath144myr .",
    "taking into account only the runs performed for our `` nominal '' initial size and including the yarkovsky effect , we find the age of lixiaohua family to be @xmath4  myr .",
    "this value lies towards the lower end but comfortably within the range ( @xmath145myr ) given by @xcite .",
    "we note that , when the yarkovsky effect is taken into account , the age of the family turns out to be longer by @xmath146myr ( see also fig.[fig11 ] ) .",
    "this is a purely dynamical effect , related to the fact that bodies can drift towards the mcz from the adjacent non - diffusive regions .",
    "however , as more bodies enter the mcz near its center in @xmath0 and @xmath63 , it takes longer for 0.3% of random walkers to diffuse outside the confidence ellipse in @xmath97 . at the same time",
    ", bodies that are initially inside the mcz can also drift outside , to lower / higher values of @xmath2 , thus slowing down or even stop diffusing in @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "this also explains the large spread in @xmath97 observed for family members located just outside the mcz .",
    "we have presented here a refined statistical model for asteroid transport , which accounts for the local structure of the phase - space , by using variable diffusion coefficients .",
    "also , the model takes into account the long - term drift in semi - major axis of asteroids , induced by the yarkovsky / yorp effects .",
    "this model can be applied to simulate the evolution of asteroid families , also giving rise to an advanced version of the `` chaotic chronology '' method for the determination of the age of asteroid families .",
    "we applied our model to the veritas family , whose age is well constrained from previous works .",
    "this allowed us to assess the quality and to calibrate our model .",
    "we first analyzed the local diffusion characteristics in the region of veritas .",
    "our results showed that local diffusion coefficients vary by about a factor of @xmath100 across the @xmath97 region covered by the ( 5,-2,-2 ) mmr .",
    "thus , although local coefficients are needed to accurately model ( by the mcmc method ) the evolution of the distribution of group - a members , average coefficients are enough for a reasonably accurate estimation of the family s age .",
    "we note though that the variable coefficients model reduces the error in @xmath102 by @xmath122 , but requires a computationally expensive procedure . using the variable coefficients mcmc model",
    ", we found the age of the veritas family to be @xmath102 = ( 8.7@xmath61.2 )  myr ; a result in very good agreement with that of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we used our model to estimate also the age of the lixiaohua family .",
    "this family is similar to the veritas family in many respects ; it is a typical outer - belt family of c - type asteroids , crossed by several mmrs . like the veritas family ,",
    "only the main chaotic zone ( mcz ) shows appreciable diffusion in both eccentricity and inclination . on the other hand , this is a much older family and the yarkovsky effect can no longer be ignored .",
    "this is evident from the distribution of family members , adjacent to the mcz .",
    "our model suggests that the age of this family is between 100 and 230  myr , the best estimate being @xmath147myr .",
    "note that the relative error is @xmath148 , i.e.  close to the @xmath149 that @xcite found for the veritas case , using a constant coefficients mcmc model .",
    "our model shares some similarities with the yarkovsky / yorp chronology .",
    "both methods are basically statistical and make use of the quasi - linear time evolution of certain statistical quantities ( either the spread in @xmath150 or the dispersion in @xmath0 and @xmath63 ) , describing a family .",
    "there are , however , important differences .",
    "the yarkovsky / yorp chronology method works better for older families and the age estimates are more accurate for this class of asteroid families ( provided there are no other important effects on that time scale ) . on the other hand , for our method to be efficient , we need that diffusion is fast enough to cause measurable effects , but slow enough so that most of the family members are still forming a robust family structure ( i.e. there is no dynamical `` sink '' that would lead to a severe depletion of the chaotic zone ) .",
    "thus , our model can be applied to a limited number of families that reside in complex phase - space regions , but , in the same time , this is the only model that takes into account the chaotic dispersion of these families",
    ". there are at least a few families for which both chronology methods can be applied , thus leading to more reliable age estimates , as well as to a direct comparison of the two different chronologies .",
    "for example , the families of ( 20 ) massalia and ( 778 ) theobalda would be good test cases .",
    "we , however , reserve this for future work .",
    "an important advantage of the model is that it can be used to estimate the physical properties of a dynamically complex asteroid family , provided that its age is known by independent means ( e.g.  by applying the method of @xcite to the regular members of the family ) .",
    "a large number of mcmc runs can be performed at low computational cost , thus allowing a thorough analysis of the physical parameters of family members or the properties of the original ejection velocities field that better reproduce the currently observed shape of the family .",
