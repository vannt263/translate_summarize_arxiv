    "the sunyaev - zeldovich ( s - z ) effect is a small intensity change that results from compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation by electrons in the hot gas in clusters of galaxies ( zeldovich & sunyaev 1969 , 1972 ) .",
    "the effect constitutes a unique cluster and cosmological probe ( for reviews , see rephaeli 1995a , birkinshaw 1999 ) , whose great potential is beginning to be realized in recent years following the major observational progress in obtaining sensitive images of the effect by ( mostly ) interferometric arrays ( jones et al .",
    "1993 , carlstrom et al .",
    "2000 , udomprasert , mason , & readhead 2000 , and the review by carlstrom 2001 ) and the increasingly more precise values of the hubble constant ( @xmath2 ) that have been deduced from s - z and x - ray measurements .",
    "for example , a fit to data from 33 cluster distances yields @xmath3 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 ( in a flat cosmological model ) , with direct observational errors of @xmath5 ( carlstrom 2001 ) , but with a much larger level of systematic uncertainties . among others ,",
    "the latter include simplified modeling of the properties of the hot intracluster ( ic ) gas , and cluster morphology .",
    "these are the main limitations to the use of the s - z effect as a precise cosmological probe , and as such give further motivation for in - depth studies of the cluster environment .",
    "energetic non - thermal ( nt ) electrons whose pressure is not negligible compared to the thermal gas pressure constitute an aspect of ic phenomena with possibly appreciable ramifications for precision s - z measurements .",
    "the presence of significant energetic electron populations in many clusters has been known from measurements of diffuse ic radio emission , and recently also from nt x - ray emission in a few clusters ( rephaeli , gruber & blanco 1999 , hereafter rgb , fusco - femiano 1999 , kaastra et al .",
    "1999 , gruber & rephaeli 2002 ) .",
    "nt electrons produce an additional degree of comptonization which amounts to a small intensity change ( @xmath6 ) that must be accounted for , particularly in the measurement of @xmath2 from the thermal component , and peculiar cluster velocities from the kinematic component of the s - z effect .",
    "relativistic generalizations ( rephaeli 1995b , challinor & lasenby 1998 , sazonov & sunyaev 1998 ) of the original non - relativistic calculations of ( 1972 , 1980 ) have now been performed to a sufficiently high level of accuracy , including also terms of order @xmath7 ( nozawa , itoh , & kohyama 1998 , itoh 2000 , shimon & rephaeli 2002 ) , where @xmath8 is the thomson optical depth of the cluster . in calculating the effect of multiple scatterings",
    "the finite size of the cluster has to be explicitly accounted for ; this has been done in the monte - carlo simulations of molnar & birkinshaw ( 1999 ) .",
    "the treatment provides the theoretical basis for calculation also of @xmath6 .",
    "cmb comptonization by nt electrons was first assessed for conditions in lobes ( mckinnon , owen , & eilek 1991 ) and cocoons ( yamada & sugiyama 1999 ) of radio galaxies , with its possible use to measure their electron pressure .",
    "the effect of such electrons in clusters was recently considered in some more detail ( blasi & colafrancesco 1999 , ensslin & kaiser 2000 , blasi , olinto , & stebbins 2000 ) .",
    "clearly , the higher the electron pressure , the higher is the degree of comptonization induced by the electrons , and because models of nt electrons vary greatly in energy density , estimates of their impact on the cmb range from a negligible level , to a very substantial fraction of the thermal s - z effect due to the hot gas .",
    "it is quite essential to study nt electron populations in order to _ realistically _ determine the spectral and spatial profiles of @xmath6 in clusters in which extended radio emission has been measured .",
    "this may lead to ways by which their impact on s - z work can be minimized , and eventually the comptonization induced by nt electrons could perhaps even be used as a diagnostic tool of these electrons .    in this paper",
    "we perform an exact calculation of the degree of comptonization predicted in a range of nt electron models that have been proposed to explain radio , euv , and hard x - ray emission in clusters .",
    "our estimates of @xmath6 in coma and a2199 are based on recent results on the electron populations in these clusters , and the main features of the resulting spectral change are contrasted with those of the thermal component of the s - z effect .",
    "the main evidence for electrons and magnetic fields in clusters comes from measurements of extended ic regions of radio emission ( in the frequency range @xmath9 ghz ) with spectral indices and luminosities in the range @xmath10 , and @xmath11 ",
    "@xmath12 erg / s ( @xmath2 = 50 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 ) , respectively .",
    "many of the radio emitting regions detected in over 30 clusters ( giovannini , tordi , & feretti 1999 , giovannini & feretti 2000 ) are central , with sizes in the range @xmath13 mpc .",
    "the energy range of the emitting electrons depends on the value of the mean , volume - averaged magnetic field , a quantity which is not known very well , but is likely to be in the range @xmath14 @xmath15 g ( for a recent review , see rephaeli 2001 ) .",
    "the range of electron energies implied from these measurements is roughly @xmath16 gev , but electrons with energies both below and above this range are also expected on theoretical grounds .",
    "relativistic electrons produce x - ray emission in a wide spectral range by compton scattering off the cmb ( rephaeli 1979 ) and by nt bremsstrahlung .",
    "this emission has quite possibly been measured already in coma ( rephaeli , gruber & blanco 1999 , fusco - femiano 1999 ) , a2199 ( kaastra 1999 ) , a2256 ( molendi , de grandi , & fusco - femiano 2000 ) , and a2319 ( gruber & rephaeli 2002 ) by the rxte and bepposax satellites . these were spectral measurements ; the pca , hexte ( both aboard rxte ) and pds ( aboard bepposax ) experiments do not have the adequate spatial resolution .",
    "thus , we have no spatial information on nt electrons from x - ray measurements , and only rudimentary knowledge of the morphology of the radio emission ( which , however , involves also the unknown spatial distribution of the magnetic field ) .",
    "therefore , in order to avoid the need for introducing unknown parameters , we characterize electron populations in terms of the spectral distribution of their total number , ignoring their spatial profiles in the central @xmath17 mpc region where they mostly reside .    of the various proposed nt ic electron models ( see , , sarazin 1999 ) we focus here on those that have been contrasted with actual observational data , with the electron distribution appropriately normalized by the determination of both their total number and the power - law index , @xmath18 .",
    "some of the proposed electron models were motivated by the presumption that nt x - ray emission could also originate from nt bremsstrahlung by energetic  though not necessarily highly relativistic  electrons , and by an attempt to account also for observed euv emission from a few clusters .",
    "this emission is said to be nt ( , sarazin & lieu 1998 , bowyer 1999 ) , possibly by a population of low energy electrons . the full electron distribution could be described either as a sum of two separate parts ( thermal plus nt ) , or by a ` super maxwellian ' , consisting of a truncated maxwellian with a power law tail ( blasi , olinto , & stebbins 2000 ) ` sawn ' together at a given energy ( , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the electron [ and gas ] temperature ) .",
    "we consider here four specific models whose parameters in coma and a2199 have been determined from radio , euv , and nt x - ray measurements .",
    "the simplest model for the electron momentum distribution is a power - law over a sufficiently wide range so as to explain both the observed radio and possibly compton - produced x - ray emission .",
    "we express the electron spectrum in terms of the ( differential ) number , @xmath21 , per unit dimensionless momentum , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the lorentz factor and dimensionless velocity , @xmath25 , respectively , @xmath26 the limiting momenta @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the lower and higher values of @xmath29 that correspond to the _ observed radio frequency range _ , and @xmath30 is the total number of electrons with energies in this specific interval , @xmath31 $ ] .",
    "details of such a model were worked out long ago ( rephaeli 1977 , 1979 ) and will not be repeated here .",
    "suffice it to say that the _ full _ momentum range is substantially uncertain , especially its low end which is of particular relevance to our discussion here .",
    "a simple way to obtain the lower energy extension of the above distribution is to assume that steady state is attained , whereby electrons are continually accelerated to compensate for radiative energy losses  defined here in terms of @xmath32  and a population of lower energy electrons is built up .",
    "the latter can be determined by taking into account the dominant rate of energy loss at energies well below @xmath33 mev , electronic ( coulomb ) excitations , given by ( rephaeli 1979 ) @xmath34\\rm{s}^{-1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the ( thermal ) electron number density . at higher energies",
    "compton - synchrotron losses dominate ; these occur at a combined rate ( , rephaeli 1979 ) b_cs=1.3710 ^ -20[(1+z)^4 + 9.510 ^ -2 ( b/1g)^2 ] s^-1 , where @xmath36 is the cluster redshift , and @xmath37 is the mean , volume - averaged value of the magnetic field .",
    "the steady state solution is then ( rephaeli 1979 ) @xmath38 where @xmath39 .",
    "clearly , the observed radio frequency range implies that @xmath40 .",
    "( note that another possible energy loss mechanism is scattering by alfven waves , which the electrons themselves can excite if their spatial distribution is somewhat anisotropic . because of the substantial uncertainty in estimating this loss mechanism [ , rephaeli 1979 ] it will not be considered here . )",
    "parameters of this model were determined from rxte measurements of the coma cluster , assuming the emission is from compton scattering of electrons off the cmb ( rephaeli , gruber , & blanco 1999 ) , and from bepposax measurements of a2199 ( kaastra 1999 ) . this appropriately extended electron population which has a power - law form at low and high energies , but with indices whose values differ by unity , is our first model .",

    "a detailed description of the comptonized spectrum resulting from scattering of the cmb by a thermal , non - population of electrons was given by ( 1972 , 1980 ) .",
    "a more accurate treatment of the process requires generalization due to the rapid motion of electrons in the hot ( @xmath73 kev ) ic gas , as has been shown explicitly by rephaeli ( 1995a ) . a fully relativistic treatment ( but still in the thomson limit , and with electron recoil and induced scattering safely ignored ) is obviously required in order to calculate the comptonized spectrum resulting from scattering of the radiation by a nt energetic electron population .",
    "we use the approach adopted in the latter paper ( see also rephaeli & yankovitch 1997 ) .",

    "the logarithmic frequency shift in the scattering is @xmath78 where @xmath24 is the dimensionless electron velocity in the cmb frame .",

    "the corresponding change of the photon occupation number through a pathlength along the cluster , @xmath91 , is obtained by integrations over the scattering probability and electron momentum distributions , @xmath92 where @xmath8 is the optical depth of the cluster to compton scattering , and @xmath93 is the total number of electrons in the cluster .",
    "the measured quantity is the change in intensity , @xmath94 , where @xmath95 .",
    "we use the latter equation to calculate the additional intensity change induced by energetic electrons , @xmath96 , in the electron models described in the previous section , with parameter values sampling the observationally deduced ranges , as specified in table 1 for all the four electron models .",
    "if comptonization by nt electrons is not taken into account it could affect the observationally deduced value of the crossover frequency , @xmath97 , defined as the frequency at which the _ purely thermal _ effect vanishes . the exact value of @xmath97 has practical significance , since observations near this frequency are optimal for the determination of cluster peculiar velocities ( rephaeli & lahav 1991 ) from measurements of the kinematic component of the s - z effect .",
    "we have calculated the modified value of the frequency where now the _ sum _ of the thermal and nt intensity changes vanishes . for this we used the analytic expression of nozawa , itoh , & kohyama(1998 ) for the thermal and kinematic components of the s - z effect , and computed @xmath97 using the measured values of the temperatures in coma and a2199 .",
    "the impact of each of the above four nt electron models depends very much on the total number of these electrons as determined by radio , nt euv and x - ray emission .",
    "the thermal gas parameters are based on x - ray measurements . for coma ,",
    "recent xmm measurements yield @xmath98 kev for the gas temperature ( arnaud 2001 ) , and ( since quantitative results for the gas density profile from either xmm or _",

    "we have calculated @xmath115 and total electron energies in the extended power - law model described by equation ( 4 ) , using the observationally deduced model parameters in coma and a2199 .",
    "we emphasize that the basic model is a power law at high energies ( @xmath116 gev ) with the index determined from radio measurements .",
    "the distribution is then appropriately extended to lower energies ( by taking electronic excitations losses into account ) resulting in a change in the value of the index at low energies .",

    "the deduced values of @xmath115 are very small in comparison with the magnitude of the thermal s - z effect in these clusters as predicted from the measured values of the gas temperature and density . in coma",
    "the s - z effect was actually measured by herbig et al .",
    "( 1995 ) using the ovro 5.5 m telescope , and more recently by de petris ( 2002 ) using the mito telescope . in the former paper",
    "the temperature change in the center of coma was reported to be @xmath117 @xmath15k at @xmath118 ghz ( @xmath119 ) , a value which is consistent with that predicted based on the x - ray deduced parameters .",
    "a somewhat lower value was deduced by de petris ( 2002 ) .",
    "our calculated values of @xmath115 due to nt electrons are smaller than 0.001% of the predicted thermal effect in coma and a2199 . clearly , the implied shift in the value of the crossover frequency is also negligible .",
    "the very small impact of nt electrons in this model is not surprising given the relatively low energy content of these electrons , @xmath120 of the thermal electron energy in coma and a2199 .",
    "next we calculated the degree of comptonization in the shock accelerated and cooling electrons models ( ii and iii ) described in equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) .",

    "the degree of nt comptonization is negligible , less than @xmath126 of the magnitude of the thermal s - z effect in both coma and a2199 .",
    "this is mainly due to the small number of nt electrons in this model , @xmath124 0.1% of that in the shock accelerated electron model .",

    "we calculate the change of intensity , @xmath115 , shown in figure 1 , and listed in table 2 .",
    "it is clear from this figure that @xmath96 can reach an appreciable fraction of @xmath132 .",

    ", would also be observationally relevant .",
    "such a systematic shift would introduce an error in the deduced value of the peculiar velocity .",
    "the implied error ( which does not depend on the velocity , if the very small quadratic dependence of @xmath132 on the velocity is ignored ) amounts to @xmath139 km / s for coma ( @xmath140 ) , and @xmath141 km / s ( @xmath142 ) and @xmath143 km / s ( @xmath144 ) for a2199 ( values lower than 100 km / s are not shown in table 2 ) .    finally , we have calculated the heating rate of the hot gas by the nt electrons through coulomb interactions ( rephaeli 1979 , rephaeli & silk 1995 ) in the four models considered in this paper .",
    "energy deposition rates into the gas were estimated by taking a mean gas density in the central 1 mpc region of coma and a2199 .",
    "subtraction of the observed cooling rate due to thermal bremsstrahlung ( x - ray ) emission then yields the net rate of temperature change .",
    "values of the latter quantity ( in kev / gyr ) are listed in table 2 .",
    "we have briefly discussed models for nt energetic electrons and their predicted effect on the cmb based on parameters that were deduced from radio , euv , and x - ray measurements of coma and a2199 .",
    "our immediate objective has been the exact calculation of the additional degree of comptonization due to these electrons , and its possibly relevant observational consequences .",
    "only electron models that have direct observational motivation were considered .",
    "since all these models have basically a power - law form , it is clear that their impact on the cmb is largely due to the more abundant lower energy electrons ( except for the cooling electrons model ) .",
    "however , the interpretation of the euv and x - ray emissions as nt bremsstrahlung and compton scattering are not secure , so there is considerable uncertainty in quantifying electron densities . moreover ,",
    "since low energy electrons lose energy mostly by non - radiative coupling to the thermal gas , the uncertainty in the estimation of their density is particularly substantial .",
    "only the presence of electrons is well established from measurements of extended regions of radio emission in many clusters ( including coma , but not a2199 ) .",
    "clearly , radio measurements yield the electron density only if we have an independent estimate of the mean , volume - averaged value of the magnetic field in the emitting region .",
    "estimates of the mean ic field are few and uncertain ( newman , newman & rephaeli 2002 ) .    due to the lack of detailed information on ic energetic electron populations , relevant theoretical considerations are of particular interest .",
    "first , since it is virtually always the case that particle acceleration mechanisms tap only a small fraction of the energy at the source , energy density in nt electrons is likely to be only a small fraction of the gas ( which is a significant mass component of clusters ) thermal energy density .",
    "realistically , therefore , the thermal energy density in clusters is expected to set an absolute upper limit to the energy density in nt electrons , a limit which is very unlikely to be reached .",
    "second , the energetic electron population is linked to the gas mainly by coulomb coupling that results in energy transfer from energetic electrons ( and protons ) to the gas .",
    "this coupling and the resulting heating set stringent constraints on the attainment of steady state in general , and the density of low energy nt electron models in particular .",
    "we have calculated the ratio of total energy in nt electrons to that in thermal electrons in the four energetic electron models considered in this paper ; for the first three models the calculated values ( in table 2 ) are low . for the power law model of sarazin & kempner ( 2000 ) ,",
    "the corresponding values are very high ( @xmath145 in coma , and @xmath146 in a2199 ) and quite unrealistic .",
    "such large energy contents would also imply a high rate of energy transfer to the gas , and heating at a rate higher than the rate of cooling by emission of thermal radiation .",
    "this without even considering the additional heating by ic energetic protons ( whose energy density in the galaxy is higher than that of electrons ) .",
    "in fact , the single power law model of sarazin & kempner ( 2000 ) is not only unappealing from an energetic point of view , but is also questionable on a more basic physical ground : as we have stated in section 2  based on the original work of rephaeli ( 1979 )  correct extrapolation of the electron energy spectrum to low ( @xmath147 mev ) energies must account for electronic coulomb excitations , the dominant energy loss mechanism at such energies for typical gas densities in the central regions of clusters .",
    "the very weak energy dependence of this mechanism ( in contrast with the quadratic dependence of the compton - synchrotron energy loss rate ) flattens the spectrum at low energies , resulting in a much smaller number of electrons than would have been predicted otherwise .",
    "we conclude that this model is non - viable ; therefore , the high degree of implied comptonization and appreciable shift in the value of @xmath148 that are predicted in this model are at best very high upper limits to the impact of nt electrons on measurements of the s - z effect .",
    "our basic result in this paper is that exact calculation of the impact of realistically normalized models of nt electrons in coma and a2199 yields levels of the degree of comptonization by such electrons that are only a negligible fraction of the corresponding s - z effect due to the hot ic gas .",
    "it is clear from our discussion that this result is generally valid since the energy density in nt electrons is not likely to be a significant fraction of the thermal energy density . in clusters with a significant nt electron population the added comptonization due to these electrons would clearly constitute a source of confusion in the analysis of s - z measurements .",
    "since there are little or no differences in the spectral cmb signatures of thermal and nt electrons , high spatial resolution x - ray , s - z and radio measurements of these clusters would be needed in order to minimize this confusion when ( as expected ) the spatial profiles of the two electron populations are found to be detectably different .",

    "<S> use of the sunyaev - zeldovich effect as a precise cosmological probe necessitates a realistic assessment of all possible contributions to comptonization of the cosmic microwave background in clusters of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we have calculated the additional intensity change due to various possible populations of energetic electrons that have been proposed in order to account for measurements of intracluster radio , nonthermal x - ray and ( possibly also ) euv emission . </S>",
    "<S> our properly normalized estimates of ( the highly model dependent value of ) the predicted intensity change due to these electrons is well below @xmath0 and @xmath1 of the usual sunyaev - zeldovich effect due to electrons in the hot gas in coma and a2199 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these levels constitute high upper limits since they are based on energetic electron populations whose energy densities are _ comparable _ to those of the thermal gas . the main impact of nonthermal comptonization is a shift of the crossover frequency ( where the thermal effect vanishes ) to higher values . </S>",
    "<S> such a shift would have important consequences for our ability to measure cluster peculiar velocities from the kinematic component of the sunyaev - zeldovich effect . </S>"
