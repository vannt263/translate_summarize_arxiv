    "the most elegant solution to this puzzle is the seesaw mechanism  @xcite : one assumes that lepton number is violated at some high scale @xmath0 in the form of right - handed neutrino , @xmath1 , majorana masses , @xmath2 .",
    "this induces , at a lower scale , an effective operator of the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes a lepton doublet and @xmath5 the higgs field .",
    "the oscillation data then imply that @xmath6",
    ". however , it is difficult to devise an experimental test of this mechanism ( see however  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it is important to explore alternate natural mechanisms for neutrino mass generation , especially those that may be tested in experiments at low energies .    a class of such models that have astrophysical and cosmological tests are the models of late - time neutrino mass generation  @xcite .",
    "in these models , neutrino masses are protected by some flavor symmetry different from the one related to the charged fermion masses , for example some global @xmath7 symmetry .",
    "the small neutrino masses are generated when the new symmetry is broken at low scales .",
    "the effective lagrangian for these models can be schematically written for either dirac or majorana particles where the neutrino fields are neutrino mass eigenstates as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the kinetic piece of the lagrangian , @xmath10 is a dimensionless coupling , @xmath11 is a standard model neutrino field , @xmath1 is an extra field introduced for the case of neutrinos being dirac particles , @xmath12 is the scalar field and @xmath13 is the associated scalar potential .",
    "after spontaneous symmetry breaking the neutrinos acquire masses given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the mass of a particular neutrino mass eigenstate and @xmath16 is the symmetry breaking scale ( @xmath16 = @xmath17 , where @xmath17 is the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of @xmath12 ) . with just one scalar",
    "the couplings are diagonal in the mass basis .",
    "in addition , since the scalar couples to neutrinos only , the constraints on the symmetry breaking scale @xmath16 are weak  @xcite .",
    "in addition to generating neutrino mass through their vevs , the new light scalars provide another neutrino - neutrino interaction process aside from the standard model @xmath18 exchange .",
    "the effects of the neutrinos coupling to these scalars on the cosmic microwave background has been previously studied  @xcite .",
    "constraints have been placed on the symmetry breaking scale , @xmath16 , the scalar mass , @xmath19 , and the scalar - neutrino couplings , @xmath10 , in these models from cosmological considerations  @xcite , as well as from demanding that supernova cooling and the flux of the 1987a neutrinos would not be significantly modified in the presence of the additional fields  @xcite ( for constraints related to generating the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe see  @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we show that the presence of this new physics significantly modifies the spectrum of supernova relic neutrinos ( srns ) at earth .",
    "this modification occurs because srns can interact with cosmic background neutrinos through exchange of the new light scalar . in  @xcite this effect",

    "in addition , detection of this signal would also be direct evidence of the presence of the cosmic background neutrinos .",

    "in addition we show that there is a particularly interesting signal that leads to the determination of ratios of neutrino masses .",
    "the conditions for establishing a statistically significant signal above background are discussed in subsection g of section iii .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusion ] , we conclude .",
    "the resonance interaction of the srn with cosmic background neutrinos through the exchange of a new light scalar was previously discussed in  @xcite for a single neutrino mass eigenstate with @xmath21 .    in this paper",
    "we consider the case of the scalar interacting with three neutrino mass eigenstates and show the very interesting effect on the observed srn spectrum for the normal mass hierarchy , inverted mass hierarchy , and for quasi - degenerate neutrino masses .",

    "we show that the addition of a new light scalar opens the possibility of determining the neutrino mass hierarchy independent of the neutrino fluxes , and also independent of the adiabatic or non - adiabatic nature of supernova neutrino flavor evolution .",
    "we consider the modifications to the srn flux due to the resonance interaction of an srn with a neutrino in the cosmic neutrino background . in this process",

    "a neutrino observed with energy @xmath66 will have gone through resonance if its energy lies in the region @xmath67 where @xmath27 is the redshift .",
    "there will be large depletion of the srn flux in the energy domain given in eq .",
    "[ reswindow ] as long as the neutrino - scalar coupling satisfies  @xcite @xmath68 this condition comes from requiring that the mean free path for absorption is much smaller than the hubble scale .",

    "we consider for simplicity an abelian u(1 ) late neutrino mass model .",
    "this implies that the yukawa interaction between the scalars ( in particular the goldstone ) and the neutrinos are diagonal in the mass basis ( this is not the case in a model with non - abelian symmetries ) .",
    "supernova neutrinos are in their mass eigenstates and each mass eigenstate interacts only with the same mass eigenstate background neutrino via goldstone exchange . to illustrate how the interactions modify the neutrino mass eigenstate flux we consider as an example the flux of the @xmath69 mass eigenstate , @xmath70    we start by defining the modified flux of the @xmath69 eigenstates as @xmath71 .",

    "this will lead to a mean free path much smaller than the typical distance a supernova neutrino will travel to arrive at the earth , for the values of @xmath19 that we consider .",
    "we label the absorbed flux as @xmath73 .",
    "naively , the modified flux would be given by @xmath74 however , this expression does not take into account that the scalar decays back into neutrino mass eigenstates .",
    "we need to add this contribution to eq .",
    "[ resstep1 ] .",
    "the scalar can decay to any of the neutrino mass eigenstates .",
    "the probability that the scalar decays to a particular neutrino mass eigenstate is proportional to the square of the yukawa coupling of that particular neutrino mass eigenstate to the scalar . from eq .",
    "[ neutrinomass ] we note that the relative probabilities are proportional to the ratios of squares of the neutrino masses , @xmath75 then the probability that a scalar decays to the neutrino mass eigenstate @xmath69 is @xmath76 .",
    "these decays result in redistribution of the neutrino energies from zero energy up to the energy of the incident srn with a flat energy distribution .",
    "we define @xmath77 as the fraction of the flux of @xmath69 that initiate a resonance , producing a scalar which then decays back into a @xmath69 eigenstate with degraded energy ( indicated by the notation @xmath78 ) .",
    "then , eq . [ resstep1 ] is modified to @xmath79 we still need to take into account the contributions from the decays of scalars produced by other neutrino mass eigenstates .",
    "therefore , there should be a sum over all of the initial states , and eq . [ resstep2 ] becomes @xmath80 in more general notation , for the @xmath81 neutrino mass eigenstate , @xmath82 the contributions over a range of redshift must be taken to determine the total flux at earth . if neutrinos are dirac particles then there is factor of 1/2 multiplying the last term ( see discussion in section [ diracvsmajorana ] ) .",
    "the modified flux of electron neutrinos and electron antineutrinos can then be written as @xmath83 and @xmath84 finally , we note that each neutrino mass eigenstate goes through resonance at different energies given by eq .",
    "[ rescondition ] when there is just a single scalar of mass @xmath19 . depending on the details of the neutrino mass hierarchy",

    "in this section we discuss the signals for the neutrino mass hierarchy in the observed srn flux .",
    "we consider the case of the normal neutrino mass hierarchy , the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy , and the possibility that the neutrino masses are quasi - degenerate .",
    "we also show the effects of the neutrinos being dirac or majorana particles on the srn flux signal . for these cases ,",
    "unless otherwise noted , we choose the value of @xmath85 , defined in eq .",
    "[ rescondition ] , at @xmath86 to be equal to 15 mev for one of the neutrino mass eigenstates .",
    "this choice is made to illustrate the effects of the resonance process and to determine a region of the parameter space of the late - time neutrino mass generation models where the effect of the srn modification would be seen .",
    "this is so , since for water cerenkov detectors near reactors the background becomes negligible above about 13 mev  @xcite . as will be discussed in the conclusions ,",
    "the energy resolution is about 2 mev . in subsections",
    "a through e we consider the case where neutrino flavor evolution in the sn is adiabatic , and in subsection f we show that the same features are obtained for a case where the flavor evolution is nonadiabatic . in subsection g",
    "we discuss the detection of the new interactions .    in the following we focus on the flux of electron antineutrinos that arrive at earth , since the proposed water cerenkov experiments for detection are sensitive to this neutrino flavor through the interaction of electron antineutrinos with protons with a cross - section given by  @xcite @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the energy and momentum of the detected positron .",
    "note that detection of the electron neutrino component of the srn flux at a large liquid argon detector would provide complementary information  @xcite .",
    "as an example to illustrate how resonance interactions between the srn and the cosmic background neutrinos can affect the srn flux , we first consider a normal mass hierarchy of neutrino mass eigenstates . as a particular example of this hierarchy",
    "we choose the masses of the mass eigenstates to be @xmath90 this conforms to the best value of the atmospheric mass splitting @xmath91  @xcite .",
    "the value of the lightest mass , @xmath92 , was chosen to be 0.002 ev for the purpose of our numerical study , however there is no lower limit on the value of the mass of the lightest neutrino in either the normal or inverted hierarchies . if the mass of the lightest neutrino is lowered below the neutrino background temperature , @xmath93 , then the resonance for this lightest state is governed by the corresponding thermal energy of the background neutrinos ( see footnote 2 below ) . the particular choice for the neutrino masses in eq .",

    "since @xmath100 which is not far from @xmath92 ( given that the effect goes like the square root of the mass in that range ) our results will only be slightly modified when this is taken into account . ]",
    "if we choose the lightest neutrino mass eigenstate to have the resonance at 15 mev , to illustrate the effect , then the corresponding scalar mass is @xmath101 ev , and point 2 above implies that the other two resonances are @xmath102 mev and @xmath103 mev .",
    "these two resonance energies are both well below experimental detection thresholds . additionally ,",
    "because the modified electron antineutrino flux is composed only of @xmath104 and @xmath105 the overall effect on @xmath106 is a depletion since decays of the scalar primarily contribute to @xmath107 .",

    "relative to the electron antineutrino flux without interactions , the case with interactions has large depletion because of the dominant decay into the @xmath94 mass eigenstate . if we choose a heavier scalar so that the @xmath108 mass eigenstate goes through the resonance at 15 mev instead of the @xmath92 mass eigenstate ( i.e. , @xmath109 ev ) , then we get the same feature , but the depletion is smaller .",
    "this is because @xmath104 is multiplied by @xmath110 , while @xmath105 is multiplied by @xmath111 , so @xmath105 is the smaller component of the final electron antineutrino flux .",
    "if the scalar were even heavier ( i.e. , @xmath112 kev ) so that the @xmath94 mass eigenstate goes through the resonance at 15 mev , then there is no depletion in the electron antineutrino flux since both the @xmath92 and @xmath108 eigenstates would have resonances at very high energies . as a result ,",
    "neither of the corresponding fluxes would be visibly modified .",
    "the mass of the lightest neutrino can also be lowered without bound ( although as mentioned above we do not consider the cases where the mass of the lightest neutrino is below the mass of the cosmic background neutrino temperature ) . for a fixed value of @xmath19 , as the mass of the lightest state is lowered , the position of the resonance moves to higher energies until it is in a region where the flux of the srn is too small for the feature to be experimentally observable .    to illustrate the effect on the electron neutrino spectrum , relevant to argon detectors such as icarus and a future 100 kton argon detector  @xcite , we show the event rates in fig .",

    "neutrino energies lower than about 19 mev the solar neutrino flux dominates the srn flux , and at energies greater than about 40 mev the atmospheric neutrino flux begins to dominate . in fig .",
    "[ liquidargon ] , to obtain event rates , we have folded the srn flux with the cross - section for electron neutrinos to interact with argon  @xcite .",

    "whenever a scalar is produced it dominantly decays into these two heavy eigenstates with equal probabilities . because @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the contributing components to the electron antineutrino flux , in this scenario there are both regions of depletion but also regions of overall enhancement of the flux due to rescattering .",
    "we choose the case where the @xmath92 and @xmath108 mass eigenstates go through resonance at 15 mev , giving @xmath119 , and show the results in fig .",

    "[ 16mevweightedplot ] .            comparing the blue ( dashed ) curve to the red ( solid ) curve in fig .",
    "[ 16mevweightedplot ] we see that there is a depletion of the srn event rate above approximately 8 mev if the srns interact via the light scalar at resonance with the cosmic background neutrinos ( blue dashed curve ) .",
    "this depletion is present up to the location of the dip , which in this case is 16 mev .",
    "the main source of background , assuming the addition of gd to the water cerenkov detector , are nuclear reactor electron antineutrinos , but this background is small above neutrino energies of about 12 mev  @xcite .",
    "this background is dependent on the location of the experiment and could be nearly absent .",
    "clearly the detector which is not near nuclear reactors would have a better chance of seeing the signal for lower values of the resonance energy  @xcite .    to demonstrate the significance of our signal we look at an energy of 15 mev ( where the effect is most significant and the reactor background is negligible ) . at this energy",
    "we expect approximately 11 events per year at hyperk from the srn flux without new interactions ( red solid curve ) .",
    "however , if the neutrinos interact via the light scalar at resonance , then we instead predict approximately 2 events per year ( blue dashed curve ) at this energy bin ( assuming a 2 mev bin ) . the average fluctuation in the number of events expected in 5 years with no interactions can be estimated as @xmath140 events .",
    "if we take as our signal the number of events expected without interactions minus the number of events expected with interactions ( i.e. , the event deficit ) over the 5 year period ( this is @xmath141 events ) , then in 5 years one expects approximately a @xmath142 effect .",
    "a similar analysis can be performed for the previous cases discussed in this paper , but since the depletion in these cases is at lower energies one must pay careful attention to the reactor background .",
    "this analysis also requires a side band study , in order to determine the srn flux in a region where interactions are ineffective ( in our present example , this would be above 16 mev ) .",
    "this would provide the overall normalization necessary for establishing the background .",
    "clearly , once the shape of the signal without resonance and the non - srn background are known , a more sophisticated analysis ( including a bin - by - bin fit to the shape of the curves ) can be achieved , and may even provide enhanced significance .",
    "this , however , is beyond the scope of this work , whose aim we regard to be a discussion of the qualitative aspect of our new physics signal .    for a liquid argon detector ,",
    "if the resonance energy is above the cutoff for the solar neutrino flux at about 19 mev , the integrated number of srn electron neutrino events would be visibly reduced in the presence of new interactions .",
    "this is shown for a normal mass hierarchy and an inverted mass hierarchy in fig .",
    "[ liquidargon ] and fig .",
    "[ liquidargoninverted ] respectively .",
    "while our total number of events is a conservative estimate ( we use a @xmath27 evolution that is flat above @xmath143 , instead of stronger dependence  @xcite ) , the depletion of events up to the resonance cutoff is a robust feature .",
    "we find that there is approximately a 25% reduction in the number of electron neutrino absorption events with new interactions compared to without new interactions for both the normal and inverted mass hierarchies for the energy window from 19 mev to 40 mev .",
    "the late - time neutrino mass generation models could be tested by detecting unique features of the srn flux in both its electron antineutrino and neutrino components ( for other tests of new physics that can be done with the srn flux see  @xcite ) . to illustrate this new effect",
    "we have considered an abelian u(1 ) model that generates neutrino masses at low scales .",
    "however , it is clear that the main features would still hold for a more complicated , non - abelian model , although these models are already more constrained by bbn considerations .",
    "for example , one could still have observable dips in the srn spectrum if the resonances are in a desirable energy window , but the couplings are no longer proportional to the neutrino masses , and so some predictive power is lost .",
    "however , one could hope to correlate the observations of the dip locations in the srn spectrum with signals proposed to be present in the cosmic microwave background  @xcite for this case .",
    "we expect that the future generation water cerenkov detectors enriched with gadolinium such as uno , hyperkamiokande , or memphys would be able to detect a substantial number of srn antineutrino events in a year  @xcite .",
    "note that the threshold for this is on the order of 10 mev and depends on the location of the detector , especially due to reactor backgrounds  @xcite .",
    "the effects of smearing due to the energy resolution of the water cerenkov - type detector needs to also be taken into account in a detailed analysis . for a gaussian energy resolution function with width @xmath144 ( @xmath145 ) ,",
    "the smearing is only at most a few mev  @xcite in the energy domain we considered .",
    "this smearing is then always smaller than the width of the depletion features considered .",
    "the neutrino component of the srn flux could be detected by a large 100 kton liquid argon detector  @xcite .",
    "if there are neutrino - neutrino interactions through the light scalars present in these models , there is a possibility to distinguish between normal and inverted mass hierarchies and dirac versus majorana neutrinos , as well as to determine the absolute values of the neutrino masses .",
    "the ability to distinguish the neutrino mass hierarchy is independent of whether supernova neutrino flavor evolution is adiabatic or non - adiabatic .",
    "the qualitative features of the signal of new interations via light scalar , such as the depletion , enhancement at lower energies , and the possibility to distinguish between neutrino mass hierarchy , as well as the nature of the neutrino are independent of the theoretical model for the supernova neutrino energy spectrum , which predict slightly different shape and wider range of average energies for different neutrino ( antineutrino ) flavors than the krj model  @xcite .",
    "this is not surprising because the produced neutrino spectrum does not depend on the detailed shape and normalization of the initial supernova neutrino fluxes but rather on the coupling of the scalar to the final neutrino mass eigenstates . as shown in section a ( 3 ) of the first paper  @xcite , the presence of a deep dip is universal , and its position depends only on the masses of the scalar and the target neutrino , rather than any feature of the neutrino spectrum . for a normal neutrino mass hierarchy",
    "there is an overall depletion of the srn flux , while for an inverted neutrino mass hierarchy there is an enhancement of the srn flux at low energies and a region of depletion at higher energies .",
    "if a sterile neutrino with a much larger mass than the active neutrinos were also to couple to the new scalar , then independent of the details of the masses of the active neutrinos the effect would be almost complete depletion of the spectrum in some energy window since the scalar would decay predominantly to the massive sterile neutrino .",
    "all of these signals , and especially their observation , depend on the parameters of the model . in fig .",
    "[ figcompar ] we show constraints on the parameter space for which the srn effects can be obtained in the @xmath146 plane . the signals proposed here are present in the srn flux only if the couplings of the neutrino mass eigenstates to the scalar are larger than the condition given in eq .",
    "[ lowercoupling ] for a given value of @xmath19 .",
    "this condition comes from requiring that the mean free path for absorption of a srn neutrino on a cosmic background neutrino is much smaller than the hubble scale  @xcite .",
    "it is a sufficient condition to guarantee the absorption of all three neutrino flavors .",
    "this lower bound on the coupling is represented by the diagonal blue ( solid ) line .",
    "if the resonance energy is below 12 mev then there is a large background from nuclear reactor antineutrinos  @xcite .",
    "to have a significant signal we take @xmath19 to be above @xmath147 , where @xmath148 is approximately 15 mev .",
    "these threshold values are represented by the three vertical red dashed lines which are calculated for values of @xmath149 if the mass of the scalar is larger than these values , then the signal would be above the reactor background .",
    "similarly , the signal would not be observable if the mass of the scalar is large so that the heaviest neutrino mass eigenstate has a resonance energy in the region where the srn flux is small .",
    "we also show the constraint imposed by bbn considerations , which is similar to the bound obtained from sn cooling and to the bound from the observation of undegraded sn1987a neutrino flux  @xcite .",
    "the srn flux is also sensitive to the non - resonant process , for example @xmath150 , but only in a very small region of the parameter space , above the horizonal black dashed line and below the horizontal red solid line  @xcite .",
    "the area above the diagonal green dashed line corresponds to the bbn constraint for a non - abelian majorana case .",
    "we note that there is still a large range of parameter space where the couplings are large enough to give srn flux modification in an energy window that large neutrino detectors could directly probe .    )",
    "the region above the red ( solid horizontal ) line is excluded by the bbn constraint ( for the dirac case ) , sn cooling ( for majorana case ) and due to the observation of ( undegraded ) sn1987a neutrinos . in the region below the blue ( solid slanting )",
    "line the mean free path is too long for the resonance to occur . the region above the green ( dashed slanting ) line , which is relevant only for the non abelian majorana case , is the region excluded by the bbn constraint .",
    "the region above the black ( dashed horizontal ) line is the region of the future experimental sensitivity to the observation / non - observation of the srn neutrinos due to _ non - resonant processes . _",
    "the vertical dashed lines correspond to the minimum values of @xmath19 that lead to a depletion signal that is above the nuclear reactor antineutrino background for the neutrino masses of @xmath151 ev , @xmath152 ev , and @xmath153 ev from left to right respectively .",
    ", width=510,height=321 ]    we have shown that the cosmic background neutrinos interacting with supernova relic neutrinos through exchange of the light scalar lead to significant modification of the srn flux observed at earth .",
    "these signals would be detectable for a large region of parameter space , in some cases at a significance of more than 5@xmath154 , and measurements of the presence of these effects are well within the reach of the next - generation water cerenkov detectors enriched with gadolinium , or a large 100 kton liquid argon detector .",
    "specifically we have shown that the changes induced in the flux by the exchange of the light scalars might allow one to distinguish between neutrinos being majorana or dirac particles , the type of neutrino mass hierarchy ( normal or inverted or quasi - degenerate ) , and could also possibly determine the absolute values of the neutrino masses .",
    "an interesting feature is that the ability to distinguish neutrino mass hierarchy does not depend on the dynamics of the flavor evolution of neutrinos leaving the supernova ( whether it is adiabatic or non - adiabatic ) , or on the specific shape and normalization of the initial supernova neutrino flux .",
    "note that the hierarchy determination can be made by solely looking at the spectrum of supernova relic electron antineutrinos , without need to do the measurement of the flux of supernova relic electron neutrinos .",
    "in addition , the modification of the srn flux in any of the proposed scenarios is a clear indication of the presence of the cosmic background neutrinos left over from the era of big bang nucleosynthesis .",
