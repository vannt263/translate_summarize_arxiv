    "after a brief summary of the stability properties of the solitary waves discovered in the first part we shall devote this second part to the analysis of low energy dynamics .",
    "study of manton s adiabatic motion of solitary waves @xcite is very simple in this case because the geometric metric of the moduli ( parameter ) space that governs the dynamics does not depend on the translational parameter @xmath0 ; thus , it is always possible to apply a transformation that leads to an euclidean metric . on the other hand , there are only a few works that have addressed research into solitary waves in three - component scalar field theory models , see @xcite . in this richer case",
    "there are three - parametric families of kinks , and the adiabatic evolution of three - body lumps is associated with metrics with curvature .",
    "the low - energy dynamics of , in this case , three - body solitary waves is therefore much more intricate .    in this paper , we shall address a three - component scalar field model that generalizes the two - component model discussed in reference @xcite to three fields .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in section 1 some remarks about the stability of these solutions are given .",
    "finally , in section 2 we shall describe the adiabatic evolution on the moduli space of solutions of configurations composed of three basic lumps .",
    "in order to analyze the stability of the solitary wave solutions , we shall apply different procedures .",
    "the direct approach is study of the spectrum of the second - order fluctuation ( hessian ) operator formula ( 10 ) in part i , now around kink solutions .",
    "a non - negative spectrum of the kink hessian operator ensures that a particular solitary wave solution is stable .",
    "zero eigenvalues in the spectrum , zero modes , show that certain perturbations send static solutions into static solutions .",
    "thus , zero modes are associated to neutral equilibrium directions in a sub - space of the configuration space where the adiabatic evolution of solitary waves takes place .",
    "it is easy to check that the existence of a kink family @xmath1 bears the presence of an eigenfunction @xmath2 that belongs to the kernel of @xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath2 is a zero mode .",
    "when detailed information about the spectrum of the hessian is lacking , an interesting procedure to study the stability of kink families is the application of morse index theorem . a point referred to as a conjugate or focal point that is crossed by all the members of this family implies the existence of a negative eigenvalues in the spectrum of the hessian operator @xcite .",
    "let us consider first basic solitary waves , i.e. , the @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 kinks",
    "@xmath4 kink . because only the third component is non - null ,",
    "the hessian is a diagonal @xmath7-matrix differential operator with entries : @xmath8 the spectral problem is fully solvable because we are dealing with three ordinary schrdinger operators of the posch - teller type .",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 govern orthogonal fluctuations to the kink orbit in internal space , whereas @xmath11 takes into account fluctuations tangent to the orbit .",
    "there are no discrete eigenvalues in the spectrum of @xmath9 and @xmath12 , all the eigenfunctions belonging to the continuous spectrum . in the first case ,",
    "the continuous spectrum starts at the threshold @xmath13 ; @xmath14 is a non - degenerate eigenvalue in the @xmath15 $ ] interval but it is doubly degenerate for higher values of @xmath16 . in the second case ,",
    "the threshold is @xmath17 and the doubly degenerate spectrum starts at @xmath18 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath19 is a discrete eigenfunction of @xmath11 with @xmath20 eigenvalue ( zero mode ) due to spontaneous breaking of translation symmetry by the kink solution .",
    "the continuous spectrum @xmath21 is non - degenerate for @xmath22 $ ] and doubly degenerate for @xmath23 . in conclusion",
    ", the lack of non - negative eigenvalues allows us to claim the stability of this solution .",
    "+ the hessian for any other solitary wave solution is a non - diagonal matrix operator and the task of solving the spectral problem becomes hopeless .",
    "there is , however , a loophole to avoid this problem ( not of necessary use in the @xmath4 case ) . on the @xmath24 axis ,",
    "the hamilton characteristic function formula ( 25 ) in part i becomes : @xmath25 \\qquad .\\ ] ] the @xmath4-kink orbit is a flow line of the gradient of @xmath26 , a polynomial function .",
    "thus , the energy is given by @xmath27 , a topological bound , the absolute minimum of @xmath28 in the @xmath29 topological sector .",
    "therefore , @xmath4 is stable .",
    "2 .   @xmath5 kink . in this case",
    "the hessian is not diagonal but the alternative argument works exactly in the same manner .",
    "formula ( 25 ) in part i now reduces to : @xmath30 \\qquad .\\ ] ] again , @xmath31 is the absolute minimum of @xmath28 in the @xmath32 topological sector and the @xmath4 kink is stable .",
    "3 .   @xmath6 kink .",
    "the same argument also works with @xmath33\\ ] ] and @xmath34 , guaranteeing the stability of @xmath6 .",
    "the general hessian operator for @xmath35 and @xmath36 kinks is a non - diagonal @xmath7 matrix differential operator with an unknown spectrum .",
    "it is possible , however , to apply the morse index theorem , see @xcite .",
    "note in figures 5(c ) and 6(c ) that there are no conjugate points -points where all the trajectories meet- in the congruence of kink trajectories of this type ; the morse index theorem relating the number of conjugate points to the number of negative eigenvalues of the hessian reveals that both the @xmath35 and @xmath36 families are formed by stable kinks .",
    "the absence of conjugate points is due to the fact that the reduced hamilton characteristic functions formula ( 25 ) in part i for both kinds of solitary waves are regular functions with no conical singularities where the gradient flow of @xmath26 would be undefined .",
    "this result is confirmed directly for a particular member , @xmath37 , of the first family . in this case",
    "the hessian operator formula ( 10 ) in part i is diagonal , with the following entries : @xmath38 and the analysis of the spectral problem is as follows : there are no discrete eigenvalues in the spectrum of @xmath9 .",
    "the continuous spectrum @xmath39 starts at the threshold @xmath40 and is non - degenerate in the @xmath41 $ ] interval but doubly degenerate for higher values .",
    "@xmath42 is a zero mode of @xmath10 due to spontaneous symmetry breaking of translational invariance by the solitary wave .",
    "the continuous spectrum @xmath43 is non - degenerate for @xmath44 $ ] and doubly degenerate for @xmath45 . finally , the third component , @xmath11 , has a zero mode with eigenfunction @xmath46 due to motion without energy cost in the space of kink orbits .",
    "we find a continuous spectrum , which is non degenerate in the range @xmath47 $ ] and doubly degenerate from this value .",
    "again all the eigenvalues are non - negative and the stability of this solution is established .",
    "the @xmath48 kinks , encompassing the three basic kinks with no static forces between them , form a set of distinguished solitary waves of this system .",
    "one- and two - body solitary waves arise in this model because of the embedding of lower dimensional systems of the same type .",
    "they are generic in the sense that this variety of solutions depends on as many parameters -two apart from the center of the kinks- as possible for a three - component scalar field theory .",
    "moreover , the stability of this two - parametric kink family is easily established by a quick and visual application of the morse index theorem .",
    "away from the vacuum points , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the @xmath48 kink orbits do not intersect ; there are no conjugate points , see figure 7(c ) .",
    "being the gradient flow lines of @xmath26 formula ( 25 ) in part i , conjugate points can not exist because @xmath26 is a regular function and the flow is well defined .",
    "therefore , these solutions are stable .",
    "although the hessian operator is a very complicated @xmath7 non - diagonal matrix differential operator and although the spectrum is essentially unknown , it is easy to prove the existence of three zero modes : 1 ) @xmath51 , 2 ) @xmath52 , and 3 ) @xmath53 . given a one - parametric family of solutions @xmath54 , simply differentiate both sides of the static field equations with respect to the parameter : @xmath55    on the other hand , the spectral problem is solvable for a particular member , the @xmath56 kink , living in the @xmath57 axis .",
    "the operator is diagonal with entries @xmath58 where @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath9 governs the behavior of the fluctuations tangent to the orbit on the solution whereas @xmath10 and @xmath11 govern the orthogonal perturbations to the kink orbit , pushing the solution towards another with non - null values of @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the discrete spectrum of @xmath9 comprises only a zero mode whose eigenfunction is @xmath62 , whereas the continuous spectrum @xmath63 is non - degenerate for @xmath64 $ ] and doubly degenerate for values greater than @xmath65 .",
    "likewise @xmath10 presents a zero mode with eigenfunction @xmath66 and the continuous spectrum is non degenerate in the range @xmath67 $ ] ; doubly degeneracy of the spectrum starts from this value .",
    "finally , @xmath11 holds a zero mode with eigenfunction @xmath68 and @xmath69 $ ] and @xmath70 are respectively the ranges of the singly and doubly degenerate continuous spectrum .",
    "we conclude the stability of this solution .",
    "note that the @xmath71 and @xmath72 kink trajectories always meet at a common point : the conjugate point , see figure 11(c ) and 12(c ) . for the @xmath73 family , this point is the focus @xmath74 , whereas for the family @xmath75 it is one of umbilicus points @xmath76 of @xmath77 .",
    "this is the signal of the instability of these solutions : according to the morse index theorem , the hessian for any member of these families has a negative eigenvalue @xcite .",
    "the undefined flow at the foci of the ellipse @xmath78 or the umbilical points of the ellipsoid @xmath77 arise because the sign combinations in the hamilton characteristic function providing these trajectories are such that , back in cartesian coordinates , @xmath26 is a function which is non - differentiable at either @xmath74 or @xmath76 .",
    "thus , these are flow lines obtained by gluing two flow lines generated by different hamilton characteristic functions at these points .",
    "the energy depends not only on the value of the hamilton function at the beginning and the end of the orbit but also on the values at the conjugate points .",
    "the absolute minimum value of the energy in the corresponding topological sector is non - saturated and four - body kinks are unstable .    for the one - parametric six - body @xmath79 and @xmath80",
    "kink families , the situation is exactly the same .",
    "there exists a conjugate point , which is crossed by all the members of each family . for the @xmath79 it is the focus @xmath81 of the ellipse @xmath82 , and for the @xmath80 it is the focus @xmath83 of the ellipse @xmath84 .",
    "again , application of the morse index theorem and considerations on the impossibility of reaching the absolute minimum of the energy when there are conjugate points reveal the instability of six - body lumps .",
    "the case of seven - body solitary waves @xmath85 is more complicated .",
    "there exist focal lines , curves of conjugate points ; on each point of the characteristic hyperbola @xmath86 a whole one - parametric subfamily of trajectories meet .",
    "the same is true for a point in the characteristic ellipse @xmath87 .",
    "the morse index theorem tells us that the hessian for these solutions has two negative eigenvalues .",
    "furthermore , the absolute minimum of the energy is not reached by @xmath85 kinks because of the existence of lines of conjugate points crossed by the kink orbits : the instability of seven - body solitary waves is proved .",
    "the dynamical reason for the instability of these solitary waves is the peculiar configuration of the lumps arranged in these solutions .",
    "all these solitary waves are static solutions formed by several basic particles , where some of these lumps travel superposed . because they are static solutions ,",
    "the lumps are distributed in order to achieve an equilibrium configuration where no forces between lumps are involved : the exact overlapping between lumps produces this balance of forces .",
    "any small perturbation slightly splitting the superposed lumps breaks the unstable equilibrium releasing forces between the lumps .",
    "the negative eigenvalues of the hessian operator associated with this process indicate that the evolution of these solitary waves moves them away from the initial static configurations .",
    "the three parameters @xmath0 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 of the @xmath88 family of solitary waves fix the center of mass and the relative positions of the basic lumps in the composite kink configuration",
    ". we shall now study the evolution of composite solitary waves within the framework of manton s adiabatic principle , see @xcite , by looking at changes in @xmath60 and @xmath61 in time .",
    "the manton adiabatic hypothesis can be summarized as follows : the dependence on time of solitary waves develops only in the parameters of the solution , i.e. @xmath89 .",
    "this is a good approximation if the kink evolution is so slow that the differential equations formula ( 5 ) in part i are satisfied at every given @xmath90 with good accuracy .",
    "the most general family of trajectories arising in a @xmath91-dimensional hamiltonian system depends on @xmath92 parameters : @xmath91 separation constants and @xmath91 integration constants .",
    "finite action fixes the separation constants at a fixed value .",
    "therefore , the most general family of solitary waves in @xmath91-component scalar field theory depends on @xmath91 parameters , the integration constants of the finite action trajectories in the analogous mechanical system . in this case",
    "adiabatic evolution is of the general form : @xmath93 introducing this assumption in the action functional , ( [ eq : action ] ) one obtains the action for a geodesic problem : @xmath94 where the metric tensor @xmath95 , the christoffel symbols @xmath96 , and the curvature tensor are : @xmath97 @xmath98 \\quad , \\quad r_{ijkm}+r_{ikmj}+r_{imjk}=0 \\qquad , \\ ] ] @xmath99    study of the evolution of solitary waves thus turns into a geometric problem in the adiabatic regime : the analysis of geodesic motion in the moduli space of parameters where a non - euclidean metric is inherited from the dynamics of the zero modes .",
    "the geodesics obey the associated lagrange equations : @xmath100    back in our @xmath101 scalar field theory we consider @xmath102 and @xmath103 as local coordinates in the moduli space of parameters for @xmath48 three - body solitary waves .",
    "both the dynamics and the geometry of the center of mass determined by the @xmath0 parameter are trivial : the component @xmath104 is constant , the geodesics being straight lines @xmath105 . therefore , the dynamics of the center of mass obeys galilean , rather than lorentzian , velocity transformations in the adiabatic regime . choosing the values of the coupling constants @xmath106 and defining the variable @xmath107 as in section  3",
    ", we obtain the following integral expressions for the components of the metric tensor : @xmath108}{2\\sqrt{2 } ( 1+a^2 z+b^2 z^2+z^3)^3 } dz \\label{eq : met3 } \\qquad .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] integrals of rational functions in ( [ eq : met1 ] ) , ( [ eq;met2 ] ) and ( [ eq : met3 ] ) would be feasible but , depending on the arbitrary parameters @xmath60 and @xmath61 , the quadratures involved in this calculation lead to expressions that are so complicated that there is no advantage in addressing the problem analytically . numerical integration , however , gives us interesting qualitative information about the metric tensor and the scalar curvature . in figure 16 , the components of the metric tensor as well as the scalar curvature are displayed as a function of @xmath60 and @xmath61 .    , b ) @xmath109 , c ) @xmath110 , d ) r(a , b ) .",

    "the geodesics tend to approach each other whereas where it is negative the geodesics move away .",
    "therefore , a certain interaction between lumps arises in the study of the evolution of solitary waves even in the adiabatic approximation .",
    "recall that @xmath111 solitary waves are stable and the zero modes are the lowest energy eigenfunctions of the hessian operator ; low - energy fluctuations are dominated mainly by these channels , certifying the efficacy of the adiabatic procedure . for this reason , the adiabatic method is not applicable to unstable configurations , such as four - body , @xmath71 or @xmath72 , six - body , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , and seven - body , @xmath112 , solitary waves , because negative eigenvalues arise in the spectrum of the hessian for these kinks .    to gain more precise knowledge about adiabatic motion we numerically solve the geodesic equation ( [ eq : geode ] ) for some different choices of the initial conditions @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "the values of the parameters @xmath117 and @xmath118 at @xmath119 specify the initial static configuration @xmath48 and the soft perturbations on the kinks due to the zero modes @xmath120 and @xmath121 are determined by the values of the time - derivatives @xmath122 and @xmath123 at @xmath119 .",
    "we first describe the scattering process when a perturbation due to the zero mode @xmath68 is exerted on a @xmath124 kink with @xmath125 large .",
    "the initial solitary wave starts from some point in the green zone c of the moduli space ( figure 9 ) so that the configuration is formed by two lumps : a @xmath4 kink is on the right of the energy density profile and the superposition of a @xmath6 and a @xmath5 kink is on the left .",
    "these lumps approach each other , later crash into each other in the red zone a , and finally bounce back , recovering their original shape again in the other branch of green zone c , see figure 17(a ) .    the process illustrated in figure 17(b ) is similar to the previous one . here",
    ", a perturbation due to the zero mode @xmath126 is applied to a @xmath127 solitary wave .",
    "the initial configuration is formed by a @xmath5 lump and the superposition of a @xmath6 and a @xmath4 kink .",
    "the process of scattering is as follows : the two lumps approach each other in the green zone b , collide and travel superposed along the red zone a for a period of time and finally split into two lumps , recovering the initial configuration in the other branch of green zone b.            f. jona and g. shirane , _ ferroelectric crystals _ , ( 1993 ) new york , dover ; e.k .",
