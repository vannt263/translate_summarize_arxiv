    "uncovering the true mechanism behind electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) is the primary goal of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) experiments .",
    "while waiting for the experimental verdict , a large variety of theoretical explanations have been proposed to date .",
    "the higgs sector of the standard model ( sm ) is one possibility .",
    "the latter , however , is well known to suffer from severe instability , as the mass of the higgs boson is naturally driven to the ultraviolet cutoff scale .",
    "it is important to stress that a time honored mechanism for spontaneous symmetry breaking and stabilization of the symmetry breaking scale is well known to occur in nature .",
    "quantum chromo - dynamics ( qcd ) induces dynamically a chiral - symmetry - breaking quark condensate intimately related to the pion decaying constant , @xmath3 mev . because of this phenomenon , even in absence of the higgs sector , the sm electroweak symmetry is already broken , and the gauge bosons acquire a small mass around @xmath4 mev .",
    "it is therefore a fact that a _ little _ dynamical ewsb occurs in nature already at a few tens of mev s .",
    "however , the bulk of the gauge boson masses still needs to be explained .",
    "an interesting possibility is that a new strong interaction , technicolor ( tc )  @xcite , provides the bulk contribution to the ew gauge bosons masses : this occurs if the technipion decay constant is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 gev , and @xmath7 is the number of electroweak technidoublets .",
    "the sm fermions interact with the condensate , and acquire mass , through an additional interaction , extended technicolor ( etc ) @xcite , which is spontaneously broken at a scale much larger than the ewsb scale .",
    "in addition to the sm fermion masses , the etc interactions can potentially induce flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) .",
    "suppressing the latter requires raising the etc scale , whereas generating the right masses ( as well as mixings ) in the sm fermion sector requires lowering the etc scale , especially for the top quark .",
    "this tension can be alleviated if the tc dynamics together with the etc interactions feels the potential presence , in the parameters of the theory , of a nearby infrared fixed point . @xcite .",
    "this is not an automatic feature of any strongly coupled theory , given that one can also have cases in which the presence of a nearby fixed point is not felt by the theory @xcite .",
    "the first kind of dynamics is known as walking while the second as jumping @xcite . walking requires the underlying coupling to run slowly for a certain range of energies above the ewsb scale , while jumping will have a fast decreasing tc coupling constant even just above the ewsb scale .",
    "walking dynamics is phenomenologically interesting in that it enhances the technifermion condensate , as the latter scales approximately with the anomalous dimension at the infrared fixed point , whereas the operators mediating fcnc are not enhanced .",
    "de facto , it separates the scale of flavor physics from the one responsible for ewsb .",
    "an example of controllable four - dimensional walking dynamics has only recently appeared in @xcite while lower dimensional field theories with similar dynamics have also been investigated in @xcite",
    ".    another interesting aspect of near - conformal tc is that , for smooth transitions between scale invariant and broken phase , one can expect a scalar isosinglet , call it @xmath8 , to be light relative to the technihadron mass scale @xmath9 .",
    "this is seen by comparing the trace anomaly in the underlying gauge theory  in which it vanishes as the @xmath10 function approaches a fixed point  with the trace anomaly in the effective theory , under the assumption that the latter is saturated by a single scalar field @xcite .",
    "it is for this reason that such a scalar singlet is termed _",
    "technidilaton_. it is natural to identify this state with the higgs boson . in general",
    "this state can also have nonstandard couplings to the sm particles .",
    "the actual separation in mass between the technidilaton and the remaining spectrum depends on the given model .",
    "we expect that a light dilatonic state , compared to the heaviest states of the theory , will appear in models featuring multiple couplings as shown in calculable examples @xcite .",
    "furthermore , by an explicit non - perturbative _ exact _ computation in @xcite , it was shown that the lightest states need not be the dilaton .    whatever the underlying dynamics yielding a nonstandard light higgs is , we assume its presence in the spectrum , and determine its consequences on precision electroweak observables .",
    "because in the most general extensions of the sm the higgs can have couplings to @xmath11 and @xmath12 differing from the sm one , the contributions to the peskin - takeuchi @xmath0 and @xmath1 parameters @xcite will not cancel against the sm contributions  @xcite . here",
    "we compute @xmath0 and @xmath1 by trying to disentangle the contributions which are due to the nonstandard higgs sector ( interpreted as coming from a new strongly coupled sector ) , from the contributions arising from the interplay between the strongly coupled sector and the electroweak sector .",
    "this can be achieved by employing the landau gauge , in which the weak boson propagators are purely transverse ( and thus correspond to elementary weak bosons ) and the composite goldstone bosons are massless ( as in the strongly coupled sector , for zero electroweak gauge couplings ) . if the computation is done properly , the strong sector contribution to @xmath1 should vanish , as we only consider tc theories with custodial symmetry . on the other hand , the strong sector contribution to @xmath0 is not expected to vanish , but is arguably bounded by  @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the one - loop contribution to the @xmath0 parameter in a weakly coupled regime . for a tc theory with @xmath7 left - handed electroweak technidoublets , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the dimension of the technifermion representation .",
    "when comparing @xmath0 with experimental data we shall impose the bound of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bound ] ) .",
    "the latter is in agreement with the expected reduction of the @xmath0 parameter in walking theories , due to the modification of the second weinberg sum rule @xcite . assuming the bound implies that , if the higgs contribution is large enough to push the estimate outside the @xmath17 interval , the heavy resonance sector at the @xmath9 scale should adjust accordingly to restore the bound",
    "of course , our results at the effective lagrangian level are general and do not depend on this bound .",
    "one can use directly the proper lattice determination of the electroweak parameters , coming from the intrinsic strong dynamics , and use our generalized results to link the latter to the experimentally relevant quantities .",
    "however , as we shall see , the precise match requires the knowledge of the three point function of a potentially light scalar state to two pions , as well as the light scalar mass .",
    "if these two quantities are hard to estimate on the lattice , then one can still estimate the uncertainty on the matching to experiments by varying these quantities with respect to the corresponding reference values of the sm higgs .    in section [ nonlinear ]",
    "we introduce a nonstandard higgs - like state using nonlinear realizations , whereas in section [ precisions ] we determine the @xmath0 and @xmath1 parameters .",
    "in particular , we disentangle the corrections coming from the strongly - coupled higgs sector , from the ones deriving from the interplay of this sector with the sm .",
    "we also elucidate the dependence of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 parameters upon the deviations of the nonstandard higgs coupling to the sm gauge bosons .",
    "we compare with experiments in section [ exp ] where we also offer our conclusions .",
    "as motivated in the introduction , we consider theories in which the sm higgs and the electroweak goldstone bosons ( i.e. the sm higgs sector ) is nonstandard .",
    "the nonstandard higgs state is taken to be light with respect to the cutoff scale of the theory , indicated by @xmath9 .",
    "this setup is general and can be reinterpreted as emerging , for example , from new strong dynamics in which the higgs - like and the goldstone states are composite .",
    "we assume the dynamics to be walking and that the composite higgs state is light relative to the natural mass scale of the heavy resonances , i.e. @xmath18 . at energies below @xmath9 , the interactions of the composite higgs with the sm particles are well described by effective lagrangians in which all heavy resonances are integrated out .",
    "we assume that the new strong dynamics respects @xmath19 custodial isospin symmetry , and adopt a nonlinear realization for the composite states .",
    "the latter are thus classified according to linear multiplets of @xmath19 : the electroweak goldstone bosons form an @xmath19 triplet , whereas the higgs is an @xmath19 singlet . to leading order in the momentum expansion ,",
    "the interactions of the higgs with the electroweak gauge and goldstone bosons are therefore dominated by the lagrangian term @xmath20\\ { \\rm tr } \\left [ d_\\mu u d^\\mu u^\\dagger \\right ] \\",

    "( [ eq : l ] ) is arbitrary .",
    "the interaction vertices are obtained by expanding @xmath29 around @xmath30 , with higher order terms in the expansion being suppressed by inverse powers of the cutoff scale .",

    "additional contributions arise from the etc sector , and from new sectors of the theory which do not participate in the strong dynamics .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the extra lepton doublet of minimal walking technicolor , introduced to cure the topological @xmath91 witten anomaly , can be adjusted to give negative ( positive ) contributions to @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) , restoring agreement with the experimental bounds .",

    "in fact the higgs and the technirho both give positive contributions proportional to @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the center - of - mass energy , and this induces a unitarity loss already at a very few tevs , if @xmath96@xcite .",
    "it is of course possible that an additional resonance , heavier than the technirho , restores unitarity by providing the necessary flip in sign to the term growing like @xmath94 : this is indeed what occurs to the pion - pion scattering amplitude in qcd , in which the @xmath97 scalar resonance overturns the negative contributions from the broad sigma and the rho meson  @xcite .",
