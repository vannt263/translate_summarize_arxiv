    "in the standard model ( sm ) , the weak charged - current transitions mix quarks of different generations , which is encoded in the unitary cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix  @xcite . in the case of three generations of quarks ,",
    "the physical content of this matrix reduces to four real parameters , among which one phase , the only source of @xmath7 violation in the sm ( we do not consider minute @xmath7-violating effects from the strong - interaction @xmath8-term or from the masses of neutrinos ) .",
    "one can define these four real parameters as : @xmath9 and exploit the unitarity of the ckm matrix to determine all its elements ( and when needed , to obtain their expansion in powers of @xmath10 )  @xcite .    extracting information on these parameters from data",
    "is a challenge for both experimentalists and theorists , since the sm depends on a large set of parameters which are not predicted within its framework , and must be determined experimentally .",
    "a further problem comes from the presence of the strong interaction that binds quarks into hadrons and is still difficult to tackle theoretically , leading to most of the theoretical uncertainties discussed when extracting the ckm matrix parameters .",
    "the ckmfitter group follows this goal using a standard @xmath11-like frequentist approach , in addition to the rfit scheme to treat theoretical uncertainties , aiming at combining a large set of constraints from flavour physics  @xcite .",
    "not all the observables in flavour physics can be used as inputs for these constraints , due to limitations on our experimental and/or theoretical knowledge on these quantities .",
    "the list of inputs of the global fit is indicated in table  [ tab : expinputs ] : they fulfill the double requirement of a satisfying control of the attached theoretical uncertainties and a good experimental accuracy of their measurements .",
    "in addition , we only take as inputs the quantities that provide reasonably tight constraints on the ckm parameters @xmath12 .",
    "this selects in particular leptonic and semileptonic decays of mesons yielding information on moduli of ckm matrix elements , non - leptonic two - body @xmath0 decays related to angles of the ckm matrix , and @xmath0 and @xmath2-mixing parameters .",
    "the current situation of the global fit in the @xmath13 is indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : global fit ] .",
    "some comments are in order before discussing the metrology of the parameters .",
    "there exists a unique preferred region defined by the entire set of observables under consideration in the global fit .",
    "this region is represented by the yellow surface inscribed by the red contour line for which the values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 correspond to @xmath5 .",
    "the goodness of the fit can be addressed in the simplified case where all the inputs uncertainties are taken as gaussian , with a @xmath16-value found to be @xmath17 ( i.e. , 1.5 @xmath18 ; a rigorous derivation of the @xmath16-value in the general case is beyond the scope of this letter  @xcite ) .",
    "one obtains the following values ( at 1 @xmath18 ) for the 4 parameters describing the ckm matrix : @xmath19    at this stage , it is fair to say that the sm hypothesis has passed the statistical test of the global consistency of all observables embodied in the fit , although some discrepancies are detailed in the following sections .",
    "we are therefore allowed to perform the metrology of the ckm parameters and to give predictions for any ckm - related observable within the sm .",
    "let us add that the existence of a @xmath5 region in the @xmath20 plane is not equivalent to the statement that each individual constraint lies in the global range of @xmath5 .",
    "one of the interest of sm predictions is that each comparison between the prediction issued from the fit and the corresponding measurement constitutes a null - test of the sm hypothesis .",
    "indeed , we will see that discrepancies actually do exist among the present set of observables considered in this letter ( the corresponding pulls are reported in table  [ tab : pred : meas ] ) .",
    "we predict observables that were not used as input constraints , either because they are not measured with a sufficient accuracy yet , e.g. , @xmath21 , or because the control on the theoretical uncertainties remains controversial , e.g. , @xmath22 .",
    "the corresponding predictions can then be directly compared with their experimental measurements ( when they are available ) .",
    "we also consider some particularly interesting observables used as an input of the fit , e.g. , @xmath23 . in this last case , we must compare the measurement of the observable with the outcome of the fit without including the observable among the inputs , so that the experimental information is used only once .",
    "following this procedure , we do not take the following quantities as inputs , but we predict their values : the semileptonic asymmetries @xmath24 and @xmath25 , the weak phase in the @xmath26 mixing @xmath27 , the branching ratios of the dileptonic decays of neutral @xmath0 mesons @xmath28 ) , the branching ratio of ( exclusive and inclusive ) radiative @xmath29 transitions , and rare @xmath30 decays .",
    "the first three observables have all in common to provide only loose constraints on the ckm parameters , while the two latter , though fulfilling the requirement of a good control of their related theoretical uncertainties , are so far out of reach of the current experiments .",
    "the lhcb experiment should bring a breakthrough in that respect very soon and these quantities will be included in the global fit once the required measurement accuracy is achieved  @xcite .",
    "the experimental situation is pretty similar for the semileptonic asymmetries related to neutral - meson mixing , with the additional drawback that these observables suffer from large theoretical uncertainties .",
    "the exclusive radiative @xmath31 transitions suffer from significant uncertainties and are thus only consider for predictions . on the contrary ,",
    "the inclusive @xmath32 , which have been measured and are well controlled theoretically , will be added as input of the global fit  @xcite , but are kept for the present letter among the predictions .",
    "finally , rare kaon decays have not been measured yet or provide only loose constraints on the ckm matrix elements .",
    "in the following sections , we first discuss the main sources of theoretical uncertainty , before spelling out some of the fundamental formulae used for our predictions within the sm .",
    "we then collect the results obtained and compare them with their measurements ( when available ) .",
    "the first category of theoretical uncertainties in flavour analyses arise from matrix elements that encode the effects of strong interaction in the non - perturbative regime .",
    "these matrix elements boil down to decay constants , form factors and bag parameters for most of the observables under scrutiny in the present note , and all our predictions are subjected to and limited by the uncertainties in the determination of these observables .",
    "these uncertainties must be controlled with care since their misassessment or underestimation would affect the statements that we will make on flavour observables .    among the different methods used to estimate non - perturbative qcd parameters , quark models , sum rules , and lattice qcd ( lqcd ) simulations are tools of choice .",
    "we opt for the latter whenever possible , as they provide well - established methods to compute these observables not only with a good accuracy at the present time , but also with a theoretical framework allowing for a systematic improvement on the theoretical control of the uncertainties . over the last few years",
    ", many new estimates of the decay constants and the bag factors have been issued by different lattice collaborations , with different ways to address the uncertainties .",
    "a part of the uncertainties has a clear statistical interpretation : lattice simulations evaluate green functions in an euclidean metric expressed as path integrals using monte carlo methods , whose accuracy depends on the size of the sample of gauge configurations used for the computation in a straightforward way . but systematics are also present and depend on the strategies of computation chosen by competing lattice collaborations : discretisation methods used to describe gauge fields and fermions on a lattice , interpolating fields , parameters of the simulations , such as the size of the ( finite ) volumes and lattice spacing , the masses of the quarks that can be simulated , and the number of dynamical flavours included as sea quarks ( 2 and 2 + 1 being the most frequent , after a long period where only quenched simulations were available ) .",
    "these simulations must be extrapolated to obtain physical quantities ( relying in particular on effective theories such as chiral perturbation theory and heavy - quark effective theory ) .",
    "the combination of lattice values with different approaches to address the uncertainty budget is a critical point of most global analyses of the flavour physics data , even though the concept of the theoretical uncertainty for such quantities is ill - defined ( and hence is the combination of them ) .",
    "several approaches have been proposed to perform such a combination .",
    "we have collected the relevant lqcd calculations of the decay constants @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , as well as the bag parameters @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , and the @xmath42 form factor @xmath43 .",
    "in addition we designed an averaging method aiming at providing a systematic , reproducible and to some extent conservative scheme  @xcite .",
    "these lattice averages are the input parameters used in the fits presented in this paper .    in the specific case of decay constants , the @xmath44-flavour breaking ratios @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47",
    "are better determined than the individual decay constants .",
    "we will therefore take these ratios as well as the strange - meson decay constants as reference quantities for our inputs . in the same spirit",
    ", it is more relevant to consider the predictions of the ratio @xmath48 of the kaon and pion leptonic partial widths , as well as @xmath49 instead of the individual branching ratios .",
    "a comment is in order concerning the second category of theoretical uncertainties that are not directly related to lqcd . as far as global fit inputs are concerned , this is the case for the inclusive and exclusive determinations of @xmath50 and @xmath51 , which involve non - perturbative inputs of different nature .",
    "we use the latest hfag results  @xcite for each of these determinations and combine inclusive and exclusive determinations following the same scheme as for the combination of lattice quantities .",
    "we refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite for a more detailed discussion of each constraint , whereas the related hadronic inputs can be found in ref .  @xcite .",
    "dileptonic decays of @xmath53 and @xmath54 mesons are among the most appealing laboratories to study scalar couplings in addition to the sm couplings .",
    "the current experimental limits set by the tevatron and lhcb experiments on the dimuonic branching ratios  @xcite are already giving significant constraints on scenarios beyond the standard model .",
    "the main limitation in the current predictions arises from the knowledge of the decay constants @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
