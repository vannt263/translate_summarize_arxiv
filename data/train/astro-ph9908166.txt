    "the disk - instability model in a thin accretion disk is the most popular model for dwarf - novae ( dne ) outbursts and soft x - ray transients ( sxts ) ( for recent reviews see @xcite or @xcite ) . in this model",
    "the initial fast rise of luminosity in an outburst is due to the propagation of a heating front at the local thermal speed , while the exponential decay follows from the subsequent slow propagation of a cooling wave .",
    "the alternation of heating and cooling in these systems comes from the characteristic ` s ' shaped curve in the midplane temperature versus column density equilibrium curve ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] below ) . at all points along this curve",
    "the heating due to the local dissipation of orbital energy is balanced by radiative losses and convective heat transport .",
    "the unstable middle branch of the equilibrium curve , where column density falls with increasing midplane temperature , is produced by the hydrogen ionization transition and its effect on radiative opacities . the local heating rate is usually taken to follow some variant of the @xmath0 prescription ( @xcite ) .",
    "vertical heat transport in accretion disks is modeled following the usual treatment for radial heat transport in stars , with radiation and convection defining the thermal energy balance . unlike main - sequence stars which have stable convective zones and internal veloicty fields ,",
    "convection in accretion disks varies with time as they evolve along the thermal equilibrium curves .",
    "typically , convection has a very strong influence on the structure of the thermally and viscously unstable middle branch of the thermal equilibrium curve since the optically depth of a partially ionized disk is very large .",
    "convective mixing is not the only source of turbulent transport in stars and disks .",
    "diffusive mixing induced by shear instabilities in rotating stars has been examined by several researchers ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) for its effects on the luminosity , and evolution of stars .",
    "similarly , it is appropriate to include shear - induced turbulent mixing in the study of accretion disk structure , especially since the luminosity of accretion disks is ultimately due to the dissipation of orbital energy through some sort of shear instability .",
    "turbulent mixing is an unavoidable part of this process .",
    "furthermore , a particular local instability has been identified ( velikhov 1959 , chandrasekhar 1960 , balbus and hawley 1991 , hawley and balbus 1992 ) which is uniquely suited to playing this role , and consequently gives us a theoretical basis for evaluating the efficiency of turbulent mixing . in accretion disks",
    "the velikhov - chandrasekhar instability is commonly referred to as the balbus - hawley instability .",
    "here we abbreviate this as the bh instability .",
    "in contrast to convective transport , which only affects the convectively unstable regions and moves heat down temperature gradients , turbulent transport driven by the bh instability is ubiquitous within magnetized accretion disks , and will always act to reduce entropy gradients .",
    "the effect of turbulent diffusion due to some sort of shearing instability , not necessarily the bh instability , has been studied in the context of radial transport in thin ( important for transition fronts , e.g. see @xcite ) and advective ( @xcite ) disks , and in the context of vertical transport in t tauri disks ( @xcite ) .    in a real disk",
    "the bh instability should generate turbulence which is only moderately anisotropic ( @xcite ) , an expectation which is consistent with the available numerical simulations ( see gammie 1997 and references contained therein ) .",
    "consequently , we expect that the dimensionless form of all the transport coefficients should differ only by factors of order unity .",
    "more precisely , we note that the numerical simulations consistently suggest that the angular momentum transport is dominated by magnetic tension , and that the relevant magnetic field moment @xmath4 is a few times @xmath5 .",
    "the vertical diffusion coefficient is @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the velocity correlation time scale , and @xmath8 is a factor of a few , where @xmath9 is the local orbital frequency . we conclude that the vertical diffusion coefficient is comparable to the radial diffusion coefficient . in other words , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the usual notation for the turbulent kinematic viscosity . here",
    "we will assume that equation ( [ eq : vert ] ) is an exact equality , although in reality we expect that this is only a rough approximation .",
    "consequently , if we assume that the turbulent prandtl number is unity , the vertical thermal diffusion coefficient @xmath12 can be written as @xmath13 where @xmath9 is the keplerian angular velocity , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the disk pressure and mass density .",
    "the turbulent mixing rate across the disk is @xmath16 where we have assumed a vertical wavelength @xmath17 comparable to the vertical global pressure scale height @xmath18 . since this is also the thermal equilibration rate for the disk , this implies that turbulent mixing can have a significant effect on disk structure .",
    "the bh instability follows from the presence of a magnetic field in the disk , which requires some sort of magnetic dynamo .",
    "the value of @xmath0 is a fraction of @xmath19 , the ratio of magnetic pressure to ambient pressure .",
    "this ratio is determined by the balance between turbulent dissipation and flux generation via the ( uncertain ) dynamo process .",
    "it has long been known that the observed luminosities and timescales for dne require a larger hot state viscosity , @xmath20 , than in quiescence , @xmath21 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this could indicate a dependence of @xmath0 on temperature , or more probably on the disk geometry . on the other hand",
    ", it could simply reflect the fact that cold disks have a large neutral fraction and a high resistivity .",
    "the latter consideration has led gammie and menou ( 1998 ) to propose that disks in quiescence are cold enough to shut down all dynamo activity .",
    "evidence in favor of the former idea comes from the observed exponential decay of soft x - ray luminosity for soft x - ray transients which seems to require a scaling law for @xmath0 of the form ( @xcite , @xcite,@xcite ) @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the isothermal sound speed at the mid - plane , and @xmath25 is the radial position of the annulus .",
    "the value of @xmath26 is proportional to the assumed masses of the central black holes used to calibrate this relation .",
    "cannizzo et al .",
    "assumed a black hole mass of @xmath27 .",
    "this scaling law has been criticized ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) on the grounds that irradiation should substantially modify the structure and stability of disks around black holes . certainly a naive calculation of the optical emission from the disks of sxts during the decline from outburst fails to match the observed behavior ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , a recent study ( @xcite ) has shown that it is much more difficult for self - consistent models of irradiation to change the basic disk structure ( and by extension the x - ray light curve ) than to alter the optical emission from the disk .",
    "equation ( [ eq : ascale ] ) is not compatible with the original suggestion by balbus and hawley ( 1991 ) that the dynamo process should saturate in equipartition between the magnetic field and the gas pressure .",
    "this suggestion was motivated by the notion that the dynamo process arises from the random stretching of field lines in a turbulent medium ( @xcite , @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "this kind of dynamo is rigorously justifiable only in the limit where magnetic forces are negligible , which is obviously not the case here .",
    "equation ( [ eq : ascale ] ) may be compatible with the notion that the instability gives rise to an incoherent dynamo effect ( @xcite ) , although this predicts a somewhat steeper dependence on geometry as @xmath28 .",
    "however , the saturation of the instability as the magnetic field approaches equipartition may explain the discrepancy ( @xcite ) , and is , in any case , necessary to explain the low sensitivity to geometry seen in the numerical simulations ( whose parameters are generally equivalent to @xmath29 of order unity ) .",
    "we stress that since the dependence is fundamentally one of geometry rather than mach number , the current generation of numerical simulations are compatible with either model . here",
    "we will explore the consequences of equation ( [ eq : ascale ] ) for vertical structure , although we will also discuss the alternative , that @xmath0 is constant down to a limiting value of the magnetic reynolds number .",
    "another major issue in vertical structure calculations is the role of convection .",
    "although convection is unlikely to account for any significant level of radial angular momentum transport ( @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the fluctuating velocity fields ) in keplerian disks ( @xcite ) , it may still play an important role in vertical energy transport ( @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the fluctuating temperature field ) .",
    "the use of standard mixing length theory ( mlt ) is even more uncertain in disks than in stars , and previous structure calculations have included simple nonlinear closure schemes ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , detailed linear analyses of the convective modes ( @xcite ) , and a reduced effective mixing length ( @xcite ) . some of these calculations included the assumption that angular momentum transport is mediated by convective motions , so that the results can not be extended to ionized disks .",
    "there is an additional problem with the use of nonlinear closure schemes since such schemes typically fail to reproduce experimental and numerical results in extremely strong shearing environments , although there has been some progress in the intervening years ( cf .",
    "speziale et al .",
    "1991 ; speziale and gatski 1997 ) .",
    "a particular problem with such schemes is that they tend to underestimate the degree of anisotropy for low rossby numbers . in any case ,",
    "none of the previous work included the effect of diffusive damping and mixing due to turbulent motions acting across the reduced radial length scales .",
    "how can we determine the ` typical mode ' of convection ( i.e. in the spirit of mlt ) when differential rotation and bh turbulence are simultaneously present ? to account for nonlinear effects within the context of linear theory , we start with the linear perturbation theory of convection for keplerian disks and find the modes most resistant to the dissipative effects of shear and turbulent mixing .",
    "we use the properties of these linear modes as a guide to the nonlinear state and the typical velocity and eddy size of convective cells .",
    "we defer discussion of the empirical basis for this approach to the last section of this paper .",
    "the purpose of the paper is to calculate the vertical structure and thermal equilibrium s - curves for a variety of astrophysical disks , including the effects of turbulent energy transport throughout the whole thickness of the disk , reasonable modifications of mlt for convection in disks , and the scaling formula for @xmath0 given in equation ( [ eq : ascale ] ) .",
    "standard mlt and the associated vertical energy transport normally used in keplerian disk models are reviewed in  2 .",
    "section 3 describes the turbulent energy flux driven by the bh instability .",
    "this energy flux is particularly important if convection is suppressed .",
    "we examine the conditions for the suppression of convection in  4 . in  5 , we propose a new model for vertical energy transport in disks .",
    "we present and discuss our results for dne , sxts , and agns in  6 .",
    "finally , we summarize our results and present our conclusions in  7 .",
    "the basic equations for the vertical structure of a geometrically thin , keplerian , optically thick disk are derived from mass conservation , radiative and convective energy transport , and thermal and hydrostatic equilibrium . these give four differential equations for the column density @xmath35 , the total vertical energy flux @xmath36 , the total pressure @xmath14 , and the temperature @xmath37 as a function of distance from the disk midplane : ( @xcite , @xcite ) @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the vertical coordinate perpendicular to the disk plane and is zero at the mid - plane",
    ", @xmath40 is the mean molecular weight , @xmath41 is the rosseland opacity , @xmath42 is the radiative flux , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are defined as @xmath45 associated with the radiative flux @xmath42 and the total flux @xmath36 respectively ( @xcite ) : @xmath46 the gas pressure @xmath47 , is the difference of the total pressure and radiation pressure ; i.e. , @xmath48 we note that @xmath44 , the gradient @xmath49 when the total energy transport is carried by radiation , does not necessarily correspond to any real gradient .",
    "it is a mathematical convenience used to calculate the total flux @xmath36 . in our model the turbulent energy flux is always nonzero , although sometimes negative , and the total flux is never carried by radiation alone .",
    "we will address the nature of the turbulent energy transport later .",
    "these four differential equations have four boundary conditions .",
    "the definition of the column density @xmath50 gives @xmath51 .",
    "the reflection symmetry about the mid - plane gives @xmath52 .",
    "the other two boundary conditions follow from the definition of the photosphere , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the half - thickness ( from the mid - plane to the bottom of the photosphere ) of the disk .",
    "we need one more differential equation for the variable @xmath0 .",
    "since we lack a model for the vertical distribution of dissipation , we will assume that the scaling law for @xmath0 depends only on the mid - plane sound speed .",
    "this gives us a trivial differential equation @xmath56 with the boundary condition @xmath57 where @xmath58",
    "there are good reasons to think that equation ( [ df5 ] ) is not correct ( see , for example , figure 10 in @xcite ) , and will have to be modified once we understand the @xmath39 dependence of the dynamo process .",
    "now we turn to the cooling processes which play important roles in disks in the relevant temperature range , i.e. thousands to tens of thousands of degrees k. the usual approximations for vertical energy transport in a keplerian , optically thick accretion disk include the rosseland approximation for the radiative energy flux @xmath42 and mlt for the convective energy flux @xmath59 .",
    "hence , the total vertical flux in the convectively unstable region is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the vertical speed of the convective bubble in the mixing - length theory , @xmath62 is the mixing length for convection , @xmath63 is the specific heat at constant pressure and @xmath64 is @xmath65 estimated inside the convective bubble . notice that using @xmath64 instead of the adiabatic gradient @xmath66 implies heat exchange between a convective bubble and its environment over the course of its lifetime .",
    "this tends to erase entropy inhomogeneities and reduce the convective flux . in general , this process is described by the equation @xmath67 where @xmath68 , the convective efficiency , is given by @xmath69 here we have assumed isotropic convection so that the volume to surface ratio is @xmath70 . the convective speed in this expression is @xmath71 , the square of brunt - visl frequency with radiative damping @xmath72 , and @xmath73 is the ratio of the excess heat generated within the convective bubbles to the excess energy radiated by the convective bubbles during their lifetime , and @xmath74 is the coefficient of expansion . here",
    "the energy exchange could be the radiative losses given by @xmath68 , or it could include any other diffusive effect given by @xmath73 .",
    "we shall see that this is one of the crucial points in this paper .",
    "equation ( [ frfc ] ) can be rewritten in terms of @xmath44 and the convective efficiency for convective bubbles @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath75 where @xmath76 . equations ( [ gamma ] ) and ( [ conv ] ) were originally used for stellar models and their use for disks is somewhat questionable .",
    "the important feature of traditional mlt is implicit in our expression for @xmath68 which describes nearly isotropic convection without any drag on the motion of convective bubbles .",
    "we shall see below that equation ( [ gamma ] ) should be modified to take into account the unique properties of accretion disks : shear as a result of differential rotation and turbulent mixing , and turbulent drag , due to the bh instability .",
    "as discussed above , it seems reasonable to assume that viscous heating and angular momentum transport in hot accretion disks are driven by the bh instability . just as convective mixing leads to vertical energy transport through mixing , turbulent eddies driven by bh instability",
    "will also produce vertical energy transport at rate proportional to the local entropy gradient .",
    "hereafter the term `` turbulent flux '' will be used to denote the energy flux induced by the bh instability . as noted before , in principle the turbulent thermal conductivity is not necessarily equal to the turbulent viscosity ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , given the approximately isotropic nature of the bh instability , and for the reasons given in the discussion of equations ( [ eq : vert ] ) and ( [ conduct ] ) we will take @xmath77 . by analogy with the formula for the convective flux , we can obtain the turbulent flux by replacing the convective diffusion coefficient @xmath78 with @xmath11 .",
    "in other words , the turbulent flux driven by bh stability is given by @xmath79 where @xmath80 is ( @xmath45 ) estimated inside a turbulent bubble driven by the bh instability .",
    "introducing @xmath80 means that we also assume that there is an exchange of radiative energy between turbulent eddies driven by bh instability and their surroundings .",
    "we can define a turbulent efficiency @xmath81 for turbulent eddies analogous to @xmath68 for isotropic convection .",
    "in other words , replacing the term ( @xmath78 ) with @xmath11 in the expression for @xmath68 , we have @xmath82 and its relation with the entropy inhomogeneities associated with turbulent cells is analogous to that for convective cells : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the ratio of the excess heat generated within the turbulent bubbles to the excess heat radiated from the bubbles during their lifetime . a similar set of equations for the radiative damping of the turbulent energy flux due to shear instabilities in a differentially rotating star has been studied by maeder ( 1995 ) . in physical terms , the radiative efficiency is the ratio of the radiative cooling time scale to the eddy turnover time .",
    "the cooling time scale due to radiation in the optically thick limit is the square of the radiative diffusion length associated with the turbulent bubbles divided by the radiative conductivity @xmath85 .",
    "there are several reasons to believe that turbulent energy transport could be very important .",
    "first , convection will vanish when entropy per mass increases away from the midplane , while the turbulent flux driven by bh instability is always present .",
    "moreover , the turbulent flux can carry energy toward hot mid - plane when a disk is convectively stable .",
    "second , the turbulent flux inferred by equation ( [ turbflux ] ) has its maximal value when @xmath64 is equal to @xmath66 . in this particular case of weak radiative losses , equation ( [ turbflux ] ) is roughly equal to @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the entropy scale height .",
    "the ratio of this flux to the radiative flux ( @xmath88 ) is @xmath89 , which will be of order unity unless a disk is nearly adiabatic ( @xcite ) .",
    "in other words , the turbulent energy flux can be as large as the total energy flux when radiative losses are small .",
    "finally , and most importantly , convection can suffer from strong shearing in a keplerian disk and from strong mixing in a turbulent disk .",
    "we expect that turbulent mixing will be important whenever convective mixing is suppressed in spite of a unstable entropy gradient .",
    "we address this point in the next section .",
    "modeling convection is often considered one of the main sources of uncertainty in stellar models . despite this mlt",
    "has provided a reasonable framework for achieving an approximate understanding of stellar interiors and has been broadly applied to accretion disks .",
    "however , the question of its applicability to accretion disks has to be raised since strong shearing and mixing can be expected to have a dramatic effect on the disk environment , and to vitiate the usual assumption of nearly isotropic convection .",
    "shearing will shorten the radial width of convective cells whenever convection is weak ( i.e. the brunt - visl frequency @xmath90 ) .",
    "turbulent mixing may prevent the formation of the kind of organized convective cells assumed in mlt . here",
    "we will show how to modify mlt to take these important effects into account .",
    "we begin by considering the linear perturbation equations for nearly incompressible ( boussinesq ) , axisymmetric convection in an accretion disk some local viscosity .",
    "they are @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the frequency measured by a local observer rotating with the disk , @xmath93 is the local fractional density perturbation , @xmath94 is the pressure perturbation divided by the density , @xmath31 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 are velocity perturbations , @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the vertical and radial wavenumbers , and the vertical gravitational field is given by @xmath99 , where the second term is from the self - gravity of the disk .",
    "self - gravity is not negligible for agn disks for small @xmath0 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) which , as we shall see later , can happen when we use equation ( [ eq : ascale ] ) .",
    "this system of equations implicitly assumes that the vertical wavenumber is small compared to the pressure scale height , and other vertical scale lengths .",
    "of course , this is wrong , but it makes only a small difference if we use these equations and identify @xmath97 with the inverse pressure scale height at the end .",
    "a more serious issue is that we have simply ignored the inevitable loss of axisymmetry in the convective turbulence .",
    "again , this is not as bad as it first appears .",
    "the existence of strong shear will tend to suppress high angular wavenumber modes .",
    "physically this follows from the fact that modes with short angular wavelengths will respond to strong shearing by deforming into a spiral wave with a short radial wavelength .",
    "this will have an overwhelming effect on mode structure when the shearing time is shorter than the growth time of an unstable mode .",
    "complete suppression of the instability follows when the radial wavelength becomes longer than the characteristic scale for the variation of the comoving frequency . in other words , we require @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the convective growth rate measured by a local observer rotating with the disk , and @xmath102 is the azimuthal wavenumber .",
    "when @xmath102 satisfies this constraint , the effects of shearing will be modest .",
    "in general , this will make @xmath102 no larger than @xmath97 .",
    "when we calculate the volume to surface ratio for a typical convective cell shape below we will assume that @xmath103 .    finally , we have left the effects of turbulent damping out of the entropy equation ( equation ( [ per5 ] ) .",
    "we do this to avoid double counting , since we add this effect to the usual effect of radiative damping when calculating the efficiency of convection .",
    "we can get a rough understanding of how the local shear modifies the shape of convective cells by considering the case @xmath104 . then equations ( [ per2 ] ) through ( [ per6 ] ) imply @xmath105 where @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 is the convective growth rate . if convection is weak in the sense that @xmath109 , @xmath110 and the radial length of convection is shortened by the strong shear .",
    "in fact , we have @xmath111 if the dominant mode has a growth rate which is some fraction of @xmath112 .",
    "the radial thinning of convective cells under the influence of the local shear has important consequences for the suppression of convection .",
    "first , this radial distortion makes it much easier for turbulent diffusion , due to the bh instability , to damp out convective cells",
    ". the damping rate due to radial mixing becomes @xmath113 which is stronger than the isotropic result , @xmath114 ( assuming that @xmath115 ) . using our full perturbation equations ( [ per2 ] ) - ( [ per6 ] ) we obtain the dispersion relation @xmath116 we see that a sharp increase in @xmath117 due to the effects of shear is associated with much smaller values of @xmath101 .",
    "the second effect associated with the eddy distortion is that the average radiative diffusion length is now reduced .",
    "this means that the expression of radiative efficiency equation ( [ isogamma ] ) needs to be modified for radially deformed convective cells .",
    "the definition of the radiative efficiency gives ( @xcite ) @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the distance between the center of the convective element , where the temperature perturbation is a maximum , and its surface .",
    "the ratio @xmath120 is the volume to surface ratio for a convective bubble . under normal circumstances",
    "@xmath119 is nearly proportional to @xmath120 and is @xmath121 for the isotropic case .",
    "we can make a plausible estimate for this length scale by comparison with @xmath70 in the isotropic case .",
    "we use @xmath122 for an anisotropic parallelepiped and assume for simplicity that the convective cells have a parallelepiped shape .",
    "then the expression for radiative efficiency becomes @xmath123 where we have defined the anisotropy factor @xmath124 ^ 2={9a\\over(1 + 2a^{1/2})^2}.\\ ] ] this has a maximum value of one when @xmath125 , that is , in the isotropic limit .",
    "note that this reduction in convective efficiency has nothing to do with turbulent mixing , and is purely the result of shearing .",
    "equation ( [ anigamma ] ) shows that the radiative efficiency is reduced when the eddies are slow , @xmath126 , due to the turbulent drag and radially thin , that is @xmath127 .",
    "we have already incorporated turbulent drag into the dispersion relation ( cf . equation ( [ dispersion ] ) ) .",
    "radiative damping can be added by replacing the brunt - visl frequency for the adiabatic case with one that uses @xmath64 , as discussed in section 2 .",
    "the dimensionless gradients can be related to @xmath68 ( equation ( [ anigamma ] ) ) through equation ( [ gamma ] ) .",
    "before we do this , we need to include one last damping effect , the role of turbulent mixing in smoothing entropy gradients between convective bubbles .",
    "this is the topic of the next section .",
    "the diffusion , and eventual loss , of the entropy inhomogeneities associated with convective bubbles due to turbulent mixing is similar to the effects of radiative loss ( @xcite , @xcite ) and can therefore be treated in an analogous fashion .",
    "we do this by extending equation ( [ gamma ] ) which describes efficiency of convection in the face of radiation transfer between entropy inhomogeneities .",
    "the diffusive term @xmath73 in equation ( [ gamma ] ) can have either sign , depending on the physical context .",
    "for example , convection in extremely hot stellar interiors can involve a local competition between local thermonuclear energy generation and neutrino losses ( @xcite ) . in a similar way",
    ", entropy transfer through turbulent mixing in accretion discs can be modeled by defining @xmath73 as the ratio of the turbulent to radiative heat transfer between convective bubbles .",
    "the turbulent mixing loss under pressure equilibrium is equal to the turbulent conduction @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the temperature gradient within the convective bubbles .",
    "the radiative loss is @xmath130 in the optically thick limit .",
    "the ratio between these two , using definition of @xmath81 given in equation ( [ dpdef ] ) , gives @xmath131 which gives a decrease in convective efficiency .",
    "in summary , shearing and turbulence act together to reduce convective heat transport .",
    "shear alone shortens the radiative diffusion length , turbulent mixing alone smooths away the entropy inhomogeneities associated with convective bubbles , and the interplay of these two gives a turbulent drag on convective eddies . we can account for these three factors by modifying equations ( [ gamma ] ) and ( [ mlt1 ] ) using equation ( [ anigamma ] ) to obtain @xmath132 when these corrections lead to a suppression of convection , the turbulent heat flux induced by bh instability can have a significant effect on the vertical structure of accretion disks . as we shall see below , weak convection , where the convective growth rate is less than @xmath9 ,",
    "is typically suppressed in a wide variety of accretion disks .",
    "however , before we can show this we need to determine ` typical ' convective eddy sizes and speeds allowing for shearing and turbulent mixing .",
    "we do so in the next section .",
    "a full treatment of vertical energy transport needs to include radiation , convection , and turbulent mixing driven by bh instability . as discussed above",
    ", mlt needs to be corrected by incorporating the effects of shear and turbulent mixing . the starting point for our corrections",
    "is the linear dispersion relation equation ( [ dispersion ] ) for convection .",
    "however , it would be unreasonable to expect the use of purely linear perturbation equations to give us an accurate model of the fully nonlinear end state .",
    "the linear dispersion relation gives a family of solutions , any one of which is an equally valid starting point , but whose properties can vary tremendously .",
    "this means that we can give physically reasonable estimates for the properties of the nonlinear regime from the linear theory only if we are able to find a ` typical ' linear mode whose properties are the best guide to the nonlinear state ; i.e. , the mode which is most resistant to viscous damping and secondary instabilities .",
    "we are not going to propose a model for the turbulent spectrum for convection . instead , our objective is to produce estimates for the typical vertical velocity @xmath96 and the typical radial extent of a convective cell ( i.e. still one - mode model ) , that reduce to the usual mixing length estimates when convection is strong and small scale turbulence is weak , but which incorporate physics neglected by mlt .",
    "the growth of the convective instability is ultimately limited by dissipative turbulence generated from secondary instabilities and from the interactions between convective modes .",
    "we can quantify this by considering the ratio of the mode shear to the growth rate squared , or @xmath133 where @xmath134 and @xmath101 is the mode growth rate .",
    "when this is large the mode will quickly succumb to micro instabilities , so by minimizing @xmath135 we can choose the linear mode most relevant to the nonlinear limit .",
    "this criterion is not , by itself , adequate because we are also dealing with the effects of turbulent mixing on small scales , which will introduce an effective viscosity into the system .",
    "this suggests that we also need to minimize the ratio of viscous damping to the mode growth rate .",
    "since this is an independent effect , we will add the two in quadrature by defining a second ratio @xmath136 and minimize @xmath137 the relative weighting of these two terms is not obvious , but an equal weighting seems the most reasonable choice .",
    "note that when the system is heavily damped , @xmath138 will be large for all modes , and minimizing the sum will reduce to a minimization of @xmath138 .",
    "this guarantees that this criterion will always pick the modes that can still grow as we approach the limit of marginal stability .    for an axisymmetric , incompressible convective roll , we have @xmath139 we can combine this with the expression for @xmath32 from equation ( [ per3 ] ) , replacing @xmath140 with @xmath101 , to obtain @xmath141 the last factor of this equation should be approximately independent of mode shape ( @xmath142 ) .",
    "the dispersion relation equation ( [ dispersion ] ) in the inviscid , non - shearing , and isotropic limit gives @xmath143 . since we need to reproduce mlt in this limit we have @xmath144 in mlt we take @xmath145 in mlt , that is , the perturbation wavelength is half the size of an isotropic eddy .",
    "consequently , the last factor in equation ( [ p_s ] ) is equal to one . in the absence of rotation and viscosity",

    "this suggests that regardless of the mixing mechanism at work , the upper - right shift and the intermediate branch of the unstable branch indicate the presence of stronger mixing .",
    "this explains why both the standard mlt convection model and the addition of turbulent mixing without damping produce qualitatively similar curves , with the latter lying consistently to the right . on the other hand ,",
    "the curve for radiation and turbulent mixing alone lies on top of the curve with damped convection .",
    "this joint curve lies consistently to the left at lower temperatures , although the old standard model ( @xmath182 ) crosses it near the intermediate branch .",
    "the fact that the addition of damped convection produces no significant changes indicates that turbulent damping is very efficient in this case .",
    "the tendency of the joint curve to lie below , and to the left , of the othe curves shows that vertical heat transport via turbulent mixing is generally less effective than undamped convective transport .",

    "the undamped convection model is roughly at the upper end of the intermediate branch .",
    "both models have @xmath193 and use the scaling law for @xmath0 .",
    "there is no significant change in @xmath42 between the two models , indicating that the total mixing flux is roughly the same , but in the case of damped convection this flux is almost entirely carried by @xmath194 .",
    "we note that formally the convectively unstable region ( @xmath195 ) is not dramatically smaller in the damped case . instead , while both models have broad , and roughly equal , convectively unstable zones ( @xmath196 ) , the shrunken convective zone shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] in the damped case is due to the lack of solutions to the minimization problem for weak convection .",
    "_ this result for weak convection shows that the presence of an available source of free energy is not a guarantee of instability if the environment supplies strong damping_. in table  [ tb - dn_conv ] we see that where convection is strongest in the undamped convection model , it just barely survives in the damped model , even though the eddies are almost isotropic and roughly adiabatic ( @xmath197 ) . at this level ,",
    "even their complete elimination would not change the s - curve significantly since the curve for @xmath198 already coincides with the convectionless model .",
    "the factor @xmath199 describing the turbulent losses is smaller as @xmath68 increases .",

    "second , overshooting is important in cases where no other mixing mechanism exists . in accretion disks",

    "( [ s_curve_dnconst.eps ] ) shows the s - curve down to relatively low temperatures , and the associated range of @xmath260 .",
    "the important feature here is that a cutoff of @xmath261 or less results in s - curves with a very small range in column density .",
    "while @xmath2 may still be very large if @xmath0 drops sharply at still smaller temperatures , the propagation of a cooling front in an accretion disk depends to a large extent on the nature of the s - curve near @xmath186 and detailed models of cooling fronts indicate that the cooling sections of the disk trace a path just below the unstable equilibrium curve ( @xcite ) .",
    "a cooling wave with a nearly vertical drop , as seen here , can not be described by the rapid cooling wave theory ( @xcite,@xcite ) but should instead propagate at a fraction of the viscous accretion speed , just as expected for an s - curve with a small value of @xmath262 ( @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , models with constant @xmath0 not only show slow cooling front speeds but also frequent reversals ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "such models lack a sharp drop in @xmath0 at very low temperatures and may not represent realistic calculations of the results of gammie and menou s model .",
    "however , it is not clear that even the existence of a second unstable branch at very low temperatures would affect the cycling of a dn disk .",
    "the s - curve shown here is sufficient to produce a complete , albeit weak , thermal cycle without ever moving to lower temperatures .",
    "we caution however that this conclusions depends on using a particular value of @xmath260 for a cutoff .",
    "if the cutoff value of @xmath260 lies in the range @xmath263 to @xmath264 then a robust thermal limit cycle is still be possible for a constant @xmath0 model .",
    "we have proposed a new model for vertical energy transport in optically thick , keplerian accretion disks which takes into account the effects of turbulent mixing due to the bh instability .",
    "this includes both an evaluation of the turbulent flux @xmath194 driven by approximately isotropic turbulent cells with an effective vertical thermal conductivity @xmath265 , and the increased damping of the sheared convective cells .",
    "the latter effect includes not only radiative losses , which have been broadly discussed in the literature , but also turbulent mixing which enhances heat transport and retards convective motion .",
    "simple physical arguments , and the linear dispersion relation , indicate that weak ( @xmath266 ) convective eddies are radially thin in the shearing flow of an accretion disks .",
    "this enhances the effects of turbulent drag , radial mixing , and radiative losses .",
    "we account for these effects through an extension of linear perturbation theory using a one mode model .",
    "we choose the linear mode most resistant to secondary instabilities and to turbulent damping and by calibrate the effects of this mode by requiring agreement with mlt if turbulent viscosity and shearing are removed . following this procedure ,",
    "our model for convection becomes a minimization problem for the function @xmath179 subject to the linear dispersion relation involving several damping mechanisms .",
    "our use of quasilinear theory , calculating quadratic transport quantities and typical eddy shapes using linear modes , is reasonable , but not rigorously justifiable .",
    "generally this procedure works only when energy flows through a system in ways that already appear in a linear analysis .",
    "the appearance of strong finite amplitude instabilities would destroy the rationale behind this approach .",
    "fortunately thin accretion disks do not appear to possess such instabilities ( @xcite ) .",
    "one of the other major components of our approach , the suppression of one family of unstable modes ( convection , in this case ) by another is unusual , but not unprecedented . in laboratory plasmas",
    "we have the example of radial convection being disrupted by the spontaneous appearance of shear ( cf .",
    "burrell 1997 ) . in the context of accretion",
    "disks the suppression of the parker instability by bh induced turbulence ( @xcite ) , and previously predicted in vishniac and diamond ( 1992 ) , is very closely analogous to suppression of convection .",
    "the most problematic aspect of our treatment is our method for choosing a ` typical ' linear mode ( cf . equation ( [ criterion ] ) ) . as far as we know this method has never been proposed before and there are no definitive tests of its usefulness .",
    "however , it does capture the correct limits , i.e. settling on the remaining unstable mode in the case of marginal stability and choosing the modes least susceptible to secondary kelvin - helmholtz instabilities when damping is unimportant .",
    "we conclude that it is at least qualitatively correct .",
    "the thermal equilibrium s - curves calculated in our model differ from previous models in several ways .",
    "our models tend to reproduce previous work along the hot stable branch of the s - curve , and give the same , or nearly the same @xmath186",
    ". however , the unstable branch tends to lie somewhat below , and to the left , of previous work in the @xmath3 plane .",
    "in addition , the short , intermediate stable branch seen in previous work often disappears , and is usually more nearly vertical when it does appear .",
    "the value of @xmath2 is smaller in our models , though only by 20 - 30% . crudely speaking ,",
    "these effects are stronger for thicker disks , that is , for dne and sxts , rather than agn . however , in some respects these effects are more dramatic for sxts than for dne , largely because the different transport mechanisms give rise to more divergent s - curves in the former .",
    "agn disks are still reasonably well described by standard mlt theory without turbulent mixing .",
    "there are two reasons for the way turbulent effects scale from dne to agn .",
    "first , in an average sense , convection becomes stronger as we go to thinner disks around more massive objects .",
    "this leads to faster convective growth rates , which means that convective cells become more resistant to disruption by any reasonable level of local turbulence .",
    "second , we have adopted a scaling law which reinforces this trend by lowering the value of @xmath0 , and consequently the strength of turbulent dissipation , in thinner disks .",
    "since @xmath0 decreases and @xmath35 increases as one progresses from dne , to sxts , to agns , we find an almost complete suppression of convection in dne .",
    "models with no convection are reasonably good approximations to our models with damped convection .",
    "the specific calculations presented here rely to large extent on rather uncertain approximations in extending mlt to strongly sheared environments and in estimating the level turbulent dissipation in disks . while the procedure followed here",
    "is reasonable enough , it would clearly be better to have means of calibrating our theory for anisotropic convection .",
    "nevertheless , the qualitative nature of our results are not sensitive to the specific choices we have made . on the whole ,",
    "the results are less sensitive to the exact level at which weak convection is suppressed than to the qualitative point that weak convection is vulnerable to turbulent mixing in a sheared environment .    the work presented here is based on the assumption that the scaling law equation ( [ eq : ascale ] ) for @xmath0 is a reasonable approximation .",
    "this tends to make our corrections to mlt less important for thin disks , especially agn disks .",
    "in fact , the status of this scaling law is somewhat uncertain , for reasons given above .",
    "however , we note that a constant @xmath0 , down to some limiting value of the magnetic reynolds number , seems unable to reproduce the basic phenomenology of dne outbursts . at the same time",
    "a very low @xmath0 seems required from observations of quiescent dne ( for example @xcite ) .",
    "unless the cooling wave theory is discarded altogther it seems necessary to postulate some sort of geometric dependence for @xmath0 . on the other hand ,",
    "the bailey relation for dne suggests that the scaling law saturates for values of @xmath0 typical of dne in outburst .",
    "finally , we note that the role of irradiation ( @xcite ) and possible advection flows ( @xcite ) in sxts remain unclear , and prevent a clear understanding of the form of @xmath0 required to explain observations of thin disks .",

    "<S> we consider vertical heat transport in keplerian accretion disks , including the effects of radiation , convection , and turbulent mixing driven by the balbus - hawley instability , in astronomical systems ranging from dwarf novae ( dne ) , and soft x - ray transients ( sxts ) , to active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . in order to account for the interplay between convective and turbulent energy transport in a shearing environment </S>",
