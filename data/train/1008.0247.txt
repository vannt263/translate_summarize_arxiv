    "the start of the @xmath0-physics dates back to 1964 when decay of the long lived kaon to two pions and thus the @xmath1 violation was observed @xcite .",
    "it did nt took very long until a proposal for theoretical explanation of @xmath1 violation was made . in their famous work ,",
    "kobayashi and maskawa showed that with 4 quarks there is no reasonable way to include the @xmath1 violation @xcite .",
    "together with it they also proposed several models to explain the @xmath1 violation in kaon system , amongst which the 6 quark model got favored over time .",
    "the explanation of the @xmath1 violation in the six quark model of kobayashi and maskawa builds on the idea of quark mixing introduced by cabibbo .",
    "the quark mixing introduces difference between eigenstates of the strong and weak interaction .",
    "the @xmath1 violation requires a complex phase in order to provide a difference between process and its charge conjugate . in the four quark model ,",
    "the quark mixing is described by @xmath2 unitarity matrix . with only four quarks",
    ", states can be always rotated in order to keep the mixing matrix real and thus quark mixing can not accommodate the @xmath1 violation .",
    "other arguments , which we are not going to discuss here , prevent also suitable inclusion of the @xmath1 violation in other parts of the theory . with extension to six quarks , the mixing matrix becomes @xmath3 unitarity matrix , called cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix , @xmath4 . in this case",
    "there is no possibility to rotate away all phases and one complex phase always remains in the matrix .",
    "this complex phase of @xmath4 provides the @xmath1 violation in the standard model .",
    "the idea has two important implications .",
    "first , in addition to three quarks known in early 1970 s and predicted charm quark it postulates existence of other two quarks , called bottom and top .",
    "second , despite the tiny @xmath1 violation in the kaon system , proposed mechanism predicts large @xmath1 violation in the @xmath5 system .",
    "it took almost three decades , but both predictions were experimentally confirmed , first by discovering the bottom quark in 1977 @xcite followed by the top quark discovery in 1995 @xcite and finally by the measurement of large @xmath1 violation in the @xmath6 system in 2001 @xcite .    in order to test the kobayashi - maskawa mechanism of the @xmath1 violation many measurements are performed . in those main aim is to determine the @xmath4 with a highest possible precision .",
    "tests are often presented in a form of the so called unitarity triangle .",
    "it follows from the unitarity requirement of the @xmath4 .",
    "the product of the two columns of the matrix has to be zero in the standard model . as elements of the matrix are complex numbers , this requirement graphically represents triangle in the complex plane . in the last decade",
    "the flavor physics moved towards search for inconsistencies which would indicate presence of a new physics .",
    "we omit the charm mixing and @xmath1 violation and prospects of starting experiments which are discussed elsewhere in these proceedings . here",
    "we concentrate on the big picture with some emphasis on tensions in various measurements performed by , belle , cdf , cleo - c and d experiments .",
    "looking to the unitarity triangle there are two sets of quantities one can determine , namely angles and sides . in this section",
    "we will discuss the status of sides determinations .",
    "the sides itself are determined by the @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 elements of the @xmath4 . to determine those quantities ,",
    "two principal measurements are used .",
    "first type is the measurement of the @xmath6 oscillation frequency which determines the @xmath7 .",
    "second type is the measurement of branching fraction of semileptonic @xmath5 decays , which can be translated to the @xmath8 or @xmath9 .",
    "as there are no recent results on the @xmath5 mixing , we concentrate on semileptonic decays and determination of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 .    the determination of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 is based on the @xmath10 and @xmath11 transitions .",
    "advantage of semileptonic transitions is in confinement of the all soft qcd effects into single form factor . in general",
    "two complementary approaches exists .",
    "the first one is inclusive measurements , where one tries to measure the inclusive rate of the @xmath12 rate with @xmath13 denoting any possible hadron containing charm or up quark .",
    "the second approach uses exclusive measurements where one picks up a well defined hadron like @xmath14 in the case of @xmath9 measurement .",
    "the two approaches are complementary with inclusive being theoretically clean in a first order , while exclusive being much cleaner for experiment , but more difficult for theory . in addition , part of the good properties of the inclusive approach on the theory side is destroyed by a necessity of kinematic requirements on the experimental side . as one needs good control over background in those measurements , it is practically domain of b - factories running with the @xmath15 at the @xmath16 resonance .",
    "coming to the current status , determinations of the @xmath9 as well as the @xmath8 has some issues and inconsistencies @xcite . in the inclusive determination of the @xmath9 the fit to all information has consistently too small @xmath17 . on the other hand in the exclusive determination using",
    "@xmath18 decays , different measurements are not fully consistent with @xmath19 .",
    "this inconsistency is due to the differences between belle and results rather than inconsistence between old and new measurements .",
    "the world average determined from the inclusive measurement is @xmath20 , from the @xmath21 we obtain @xmath22 and from the @xmath23 @xmath24 .",
    "as can be seen , despite the tension in the experimental information from @xmath23 decays , the two exclusive determinations agree with each other , but the inclusive approach yields value which is about @xmath25 higher than the one from exclusive determination .    while the determination of the @xmath8 is in principle same as the determination of the @xmath9 , in practice the @xmath8 is much more difficult due to the smallness of the @xmath10 branching fraction compared to the @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath26 in this case is a significant background .",
    "kinematic selection to reduce this background destroys possibilities of theory for the precise and reliable calculations . on the inclusive determination side ,",
    "there are several groups which perform fits to the experimental data of inclusive decays .",
    "searches using semileptonic tag at belle ( left ) and fully hadronic tag at ( right).,scaledwidth=65.0% ]     searches using semileptonic tag at belle ( left ) and fully hadronic tag at ( right).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=37.0% ]   searches using semileptonic tag at belle ( left ) and fully hadronic tag at ( right).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=60.0% ]    on the exclusive side , experiment provides new result on the @xmath27 and @xmath28 . using their partial branching fraction in different momentum transfer regions together with lattice qcd calculations they derive @xmath29 @xcite , which is about @xmath30 below the inclusive determinations . if this stands , than we have another discrepancy in the sides of unitarity triangle .",
    "another way of accessing @xmath8 is to use @xmath31 leptonic decays which proceed through weak annihilation . in the standard model its rate is given by expression @xmath32 where all quantities except of @xmath33 and @xmath8 are well known .",
    "typically one takes input on the @xmath33 and @xmath8 from other measurements and puts constraints on a new physics . alternatively one can take measured branching fraction together with the prediction for @xmath33 and extract @xmath8 .",
    "b - factories provided recently evidence for this decay . both , belle and reconstruct one @xmath5 in a semileptonic or a fully hadronic decay , called tagged , together with identified charged products of the @xmath34 decay . in such events ,",
    "all what should be remaining are neutrinos and therefore one expects zero additional energy in the event . in fig .",
    "[ fig : btaunu ] we show examples of the distribution of additional energy .",
    "the belle experiment sees evidence on the level of @xmath35 in both tags @xcite while experiment obtains excess of about @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the world average of the branching fraction of @xmath37 is little higher than the sm prediction of @xmath38 and yields @xmath8 which is in some tension with other determinations .",
    "the result of the @xmath31 branching fraction brings up the question whether theory prediction from the lattice qcd for the @xmath33 is correct .",
    "one way to test predictions is to turn to charm sector where we expect smaller contributions from a new physics .",
    "decay @xmath39 is a usual testing ground for calculations .",
    "the branching fraction is given by same formula as for @xmath31 with replacing @xmath33 and @xmath8 by their appropriate counterparts .",
    "the branching fraction for @xmath40 was measured by cleo , and belle experiments and there used to be some discrepancy between the prediction for @xmath41 and its value extracted from the @xmath40 data .",
    "summary of the evolution of this discrepancy is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fds ] @xcite .",

    "the angles of the unitarity triangle are defined as @xmath48 as they are give by the phases of complex numbers , their determination is possible only through @xmath1 violation measurements . here",
    "we omit determination of the angle @xmath49 , briefly mention status of the angle @xmath50 and concentrate on the angle @xmath44 which received most of the new experimental information",
    ".    the angle @xmath50 is practically give by the @xmath7 phase .",
    "one of the process where this ckm matrix element enters is the @xmath6 mixing .",
    "its best determination comes from the measurement of @xmath1 violation due to the interference of decays with and without mixing to a common final state .",
    "using decays to @xmath51 resonance with neutral kaon extracts using final dataset @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "the latest measurement from belle experiment gives @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "it is worth to note that both experiments are still statistically limited .",
    "determination of the angle @xmath44 provides important information for tests of a physics beyond standard model .",
    "it is determined from the interference of tree level @xmath54 and @xmath55 transitions and thus having small sensitivity to a new physics .",
    "while several different decays are suggested for the determination , all current experimental information comes from the @xmath45 . in those decays ,",
    "the @xmath54 transition provides @xmath45 decay while the @xmath55 transitions yields @xmath56 final state .",
    "thus measurement of the @xmath1 violation in the final states which are common to @xmath57 and @xmath58 is needed .",
    "three different final states are currently used . the first one uses q cabibbo favored @xmath59 with q doubly cabibbo",

    "the second method uses a cabibbo suppressed @xmath57 decays like @xmath61 , @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "the third approach uses a dalitz plot analysis of a @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "the main limitation is that rates are small and up to now there was no significant measurement of the @xmath1 violation in those decays .",

    "the @xmath1 violation in the @xmath68 meson sector is currently the most exciting place and widely discussed in relation to a new physics .",
    "two results , which are in many models of a new physics related are the measurement of the @xmath1 violation in the @xmath69 decays and the flavor specific asymmetry in a semileptonic @xmath68 decays .",
    "the origin of the first one is in the interference of the decays with and without @xmath68 mixing .",
    "the standard model predicts only tiny @xmath1 violation which comes from the fact that all ckm matrix elements entering are almost real .",
    "the previous results from tevatron experiments showed about @xmath70-@xmath71 deviation from the standard model @xcite with combination being @xmath36 away .",
