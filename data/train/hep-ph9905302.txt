    "the problem on generation of magnetic fields in nonabelian gauge theories at finite temperature is of great importance for particle physics and cosmology . its positive solution , in particular , will give a theoretical basis for investigations of the qcd vacuum at high temperature and the primordial magnetic fields in the early universe @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in literature different mechanisms of producing the fields are discussed ( see recent papers @xcite,@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to investigate in more detail one of them - the spontaneous magnetization of the vacuum of non - abelian gauge fields at finite temperature .",
    "this problem was studied recently in refs.@xcite , @xcite , @xcite where the creation of the vacuum magnetic field has been derived . however , a trusty conclusion about the possibility of this phenomenon as well as estimations of the value of the condensed field have not been obtained , yet .",
    "in fact , in papers @xcite , @xcite the effective potential ( ep ) was calculated in one - loop order .",
    "but , as it is known , at finite temperature , @xmath2 , the correlation corrections to the ep are of great importance .",
    "they may in an essential way influence the properties of a system . in ref.@xcite",
    "a number of the corrections has been taken into account .",
    "these authors have determined that the possibility of the vacuum magnetization depends on the sign of the next - to - leading term of the polarization operator ( po ) of charged gluons , which has to be calculated in the field @xmath3 and at @xmath4 .",
    "however , these calculations had not been done there . besides ,",
    "in refs.@xcite,@xcite the temperature mass squared of the unstable mode present in the spectrum of charged gluons was erroneously identified with the debye one having the order @xmath5 .",
    "however , the latter mass is generated for longitudinal modes of gauge fields .",
    "the unstable mode @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the gauge coupling constant , @xmath8 is the landau level number , @xmath9 is the spin projection on the field direction , is the transversal one produced by a spin interaction with the magnetic field .",
    "therefore , the vacuum stabilization condition at @xmath10 has not been studied in detail . moreover , a part of diagrams describing correlation corrections was missed there . in papers @xcite,@xcite the scale of the magnetic field at @xmath10 was incorrectly estimated and as a consequence the authors came to negative conclusion about the vacuum magnetization .    to summarize the present time situation we recall that in one - loop approximation the savvidy level of order @xmath11 is generated .",
    "but the way of its stabilization and its existence with the correlation corrections been taken into account remain to be investigated .",
    "it will be important for what follows to remind recent results on observation of the gluon magnetic mass in lattice simulations which was found to be of order @xmath12 ( as it has been expected from nonperturbative calculation in quantum field theory @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "the mass screens magnetic fields at distances @xmath13 but inside the space region @xmath14 they may exist . since the typical values of particle masses at high temperature are @xmath15 , the magnetic fields of order @xmath16 or at least @xmath17 are to be of interest .",
    "they are able to affect all the processes at high temperatures .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate the vacuum magnetization at finite temperature within @xmath0 gluodynamics . considering the abelian covariantly constant chromomagnetic field @xmath18 and finite temperature as a background we calculate the ep containing the one - loop and the ring diagram contributions of both neutral and charged gluon fields . to find the latter ones the high temperature limits of the po of gluon fields at the magnetic background are also calculated .",
    "it will be shown that in the adopted approximation the savvidy level with the field strength @xmath19 is produced .",
    "thus , we come to the conclusion that the correlation corrections make the field strength stronger as compare to the value derived in one - loop approximation @xcite,@xcite .",
    "this , in particular , means that although the field is screened for @xmath20 , the spectrum of charged particles , being formed at larmor s radius @xmath21 , is located inside this domain @xmath22 for small @xmath23 .",
    "moreover , since at high temperatures the particle masses are of order @xmath24 , one has to conclude that a constant background magnetic field is a good approximation to investigate processes at high temperature .",
    "the content is as follows . in sect.2 the one - loop ep ( zero and finite temperature parts )",
    "is presented in the form convenient for numerical investigations .",
    "here we also present a general expression describing the contribution of the neutral gluon ring diagrams . in sect.3",
    "we calculate the debye mass of the neutral gauge field at @xmath25 . in sect.4 the same is done for the charged gluon part .",
    "sect.5 contains calculation of the two - loop diagram taking into account the self - interaction of charged gluon in the vacuum .",
    "the investigation of the vacuum magnetization and its stability as well as the discussion of the results obtained are presented in sect .",
    "in the appendix we adduce the necessary high temperature asymptotic formulae .",
    "let us consider the pure yang - mills action @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the field strength . in the @xmath0 gauge theory",
    "the savvidy vacuum state is characterized by the uniform background classical colour magnetic field @xmath28 where @xmath3 is a constant , @xmath29 is the isotopic index .    to introduce this background field",

    "the first term in eq.([epr ] ) corresponds to the one - loop ep whereas the other ones present the contributions of two- , three- , etc .",

    "this part of the ep , @xmath46 is important in the case when massless states appear in a system . the ring diagrams of either neutral and charged gluons have to be calculated when the vacuum magnetization at finite temperature is investigated .",
    "really , one first must assume that the field is nonzero , calculate ep @xmath47 and after that check whether the minimum of it is located at nonzero @xmath3 .",
    "on the other hand , if one investigates problems in the applied external field , the charged fields become massive with the mass @xmath48 and have to be omitted . to find @xmath49 the one - loop polarization operators of charged , @xmath50 and neutral , @xmath51 gluons in the external field and at finite temperature have to be calculated in the limit of zero momenta .",

    "nevertheless , the one - loop result makes hopeful the idea to have the stable vacuum due to radiation corrections to the charged gluon spectrum . naturally , to investigate this possibility the gluon polarization operator with the correlation correction included should be calculated .",
    "this problem requires an additional investigation .",
    "other interesting possibility is the formation at high temperatures of the gluon electrostatic potential , so - called @xmath182 condensate ( see survey @xcite ) , which also acts as a stabilizing factor @xcite . to realize the latter scenario consistently the simultaneous spontaneous generation of both the @xmath182 condensate and the magnetic field should be investigated .",
    "if again the homogeneous vacuum field will be found to be unstable with these improvements made , the inhomogeneous fields of the lattice type discussed in papers @xcite , @xcite,@xcite may be created .",
    "since the condensed magnetic field is strong at high temperatures , the lattice structures having the cells of order @xmath183 are located inside the region where the fields are not screened by the gluon magnetic mass .",
    "these results may found applications in problems of cosmology , in particular , in studying the primordial magnetic fields in the early universe . in a few recent years",
    "the scenario of the evolution of the universe in external hypermagnetic field @xcite , @xcite became popular .",
    "our calculation of the vacuum magnetization unambiguously determines the possibility of the presence of strong magnetic fields in the hot universe .",
    "other application is the high temperature qcd . here",
    ", one also should take into account the generation of the chromomagnetic field in the deconfinig phase . as a conclusion we stress again that savvidy s mechanism of the vacuum magnetization does work at high temperature , although a number of questions concerning the vacuum stability has to be investigated in order to derive a final picture . + the authors thank j. bohacik for useful discussion .",
