    "the new discoveries of exotic particles @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which possess spin - parity structures of @xmath5 , @xmath6 respectively @xcite , attract great interests of both theorists and experimentalists of high energy physics .",
    "some authors @xcite suppose that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are @xmath7 chiral partners of @xmath8 and @xmath9 i.e. p - wave excited states of @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "narison used the qcd spectral sum rules to calculate the masses of @xmath0 and @xmath1 by assuming that they are quark - antiquark states and obtained results which are consistent with data within a wide error range @xcite .",
    "beveren and rupp also studied the mass spectra @xcite and claimed that their results support the @xmath10 structures for @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "meanwhile , some other authors suggest that @xmath0 and @xmath1 can possibly be four - quark states @xcite .",
    "thus , one needs to try various ways to understand the structures of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in general",
    ", one can take a reasonable theoretical approach to evaluate related physical quantities and then compare the results with data to extract useful information .",
    "one can determine the structures of @xmath0 and @xmath1 by studying the production rates of the exotic particles , and our recent work @xcite is just about the production of @xmath0 in the decays of @xmath11 .",
    "recently , several groups have calculated the strong and radiative decay rates of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in different theoretical approaches : the light cone qcd sum rules , constituent quark model , vector meson dominant ( vmd ) ansatz , etc . @xcite . for a clear comparison ,",
    "the results by different groups are listed in tables 2 and 3 .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite also calculated the rates based on the assumption that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are in non-@xmath10 structures .",
    "their predictions on the @xmath0 and @xmath1 decay rates are obviously larger than that obtained by assuming the two - quark structure by orders .",
    "thus studies on the strong and radiative decays with other plausible models would be helpful .",
    "it can not only deepen our understanding about the characters of these particles , but also test the reliability of models which are applied to calculate the decays . because @xmath12 was only observed by the selex collaboration@xcite , but not by babar @xcite , belle @xcite and focus@xcite , its existence is still in dispute , so here we do not refer decays of @xmath12 .    in this work ,",
    "we study the strong and radiative decays of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the framework of constituent - quark - meson ( cqm ) model .",
    "cqm model was proposed by polosa et al .",
    "@xcite and has been well developed later based on the works of ebert et al .",
    "@xcite ( see the ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "the model is based on an effective lagrangian which incorporates the flavor - spin symmetry for heavy quarks with the chiral symmetry for light quarks . employing the cqm model to study phenomenology of heavy meson physics , reasonable results",
    "have been achieved @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can believe that the model is applicable to our processes and expect to get relatively reliable conclusion .",
    "the constraint from the phase space of the final states forbids the processes @xmath13 and @xmath14 , so that the only allowed strong decay modes are @xmath15 and @xmath16 . in principle , @xmath17 which is a @xmath18 process , is allowed by the phase space .",
    "however , it is a p - wave reaction , and the total rate is proportional to @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the three - momentum of emitted pion in the center - of - mass frame of @xmath1 . in this case",
    "@xmath21 is very small ( about @xmath22 mev ) , so that this process can only contribute to the total width a negligible fraction , in practice .",
    "the aforementioned strong decay modes obviously violate isospin conservation .",
    "therefore the decay widths of @xmath23 and @xmath16 must be highly suppressed .",
    "moreover , direct emission of a pion is ozi suppressed @xcite .",
    "cho et al . suggested a mixing mechanism of @xmath24 where the isospin violation originates from the mass splitting of @xmath25 and @xmath26 quarks @xcite . in that scenario ,",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath1 firstly transit into @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and then @xmath29 transits into @xmath30 by the mixing . in the intermediate process , @xmath29 obviously is off - shell .",
    "the mixing depends on the mass difference of @xmath29 and @xmath31 , and the effects due to the mixing between @xmath32 and @xmath31 can be ignored .",
    "another sizable mode is the radiative decay . even though , by general consideration , the electromagnetic reaction should be much less important than the strong decay",
    ", it does not suffer the suppression of isospin violation , therefore one may expect that it has a comparable size to the strong processes described above .",
    "the relevant decay modes are @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "currently the babar and the belle collaborations have completed precise measurements on the ratio of @xmath37 to @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "now babar and belle collaborations begin to further measure other decays of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we are expecting new results of babar and belle which can be applied to decisively determine the structures of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows , after the introduction , in sect .",
    "2 , we formulate the strong and radiative decays of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in sect.3 , we present our numerical results along with all the input parameters .",
    "finally , sect .",
    "4 is devoted to discussion and conclusion .",
    "some detailed expressions are collected in the appendix .",
    "first , for readers convenience , we present a brief introduction of the constituent - quark - meson ( cqm ) model @xcite .",
    "the model is relativistic and based on an effective lagrangian which combines the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) and the chiral symmetry for light quarks , @xmath39\\chi + \\bar{\\chi}\\gamma\\cdot\\mathcal{a}\\gamma_{5}\\chi - m_{q}\\bar{\\chi}\\chi+\\frac{f_{\\pi}^2}{8 } \\mathrm{tr}[\\partial^{\\mu}\\sigma\\partial_{\\mu}\\sigma^{+}]+\\bar{h}_{v}(iv\\cdot \\partial)h_{v}\\nonumber\\\\&&-[\\bar{\\chi}(\\bar{h}+\\bar{s}+i\\bar{t}^{\\mu}\\frac{\\partial_{\\mu } } { \\lambda})h_{v}+h.c.]+\\frac{1}{2g_{3}}\\mathrm{tr}[(\\bar{h}+\\bar{s})(h - s)]+\\frac{1}{2g_{4}}\\mathrm{tr } [ \\bar{t}^{\\mu}t_{\\mu}],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the fifth term is the kinetic term of heavy quarks with @xmath40 ; @xmath41 is the super - field corresponding to doublet @xmath42 of negative parity and has an explicit matrix representation : @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the annihilation operators of pseudoscalar and vector mesons which are normalized as @xmath46    @xmath47 is the super - fields related to @xmath48 , @xmath49.\\ ] ] @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) is the light quark field and @xmath52 , and @xmath53 is the octet pseudoscalar matrix .",
    "we also have @xmath54 and @xmath55    because the spin - parity of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are @xmath56 and @xmath6 , thus @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be embedded into the s - type doublet @xmath57 @xcite , whereas @xmath3 and @xmath58 belong to the h type doublet @xmath59 .",
    "then we can calculate the strong and radiative decay rates of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the cqm model .      as discussed above indirect @xmath62 and",
    "@xmath63 occur via two steps . in fig .",
    "[ diagram ] , we show the feynman diagrams which depict the strong processes @xmath64 and @xmath65 . according to chiral symmetry , @xmath29 only couples with light quark , thus it can only be emitted from the light - quark leg in fig.[diagram ] .",

    "therefore we simply assume that @xmath29 is @xmath69 and the contribution of @xmath32 , as discussed in the text , is neglected in our calculations . ]",

    "in this work , based on the assumption that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are chiral parters of @xmath3 and @xmath81 , we calculate the rates of @xmath23 and @xmath16 in the constituent - quark - meson ( cqm ) model and take into account the @xmath24 mixing mechanism @xcite .",
    "we also estimate the rates of @xmath110 , @xmath34 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 in the same model .        the ratio @xmath113 has been measured with relatively high precision @xcite , however for @xmath114 and @xmath115 , there only are upper limits given by babar , belle , and cleo collaborations@xcite .",
    "it seems that our results on the ratios well coincide with the experimental values .",
    "this consistency somehow implies that the assumption of @xmath116 being p - wave chiral partners of @xmath117 does not contradict to the data with the present experimental accuracy .",
    "the experimental upper bounds on the total widths are @xmath118 mev and @xmath119 mev @xcite . obviously , the overwhelming decay modes of @xmath120 and @xmath1 are their strong and radiative decays , therefore we can roughly take sums of these widths as the total widths of @xmath120 and @xmath1 . however , our numerical results as well as that given by other groups are in order of tens of kev , much smaller than the upper bounds set by recent experiments .",
    "the reason is obvious that the aforementioned reactions violate isospin conservation , there is a large suppression factor of about @xmath121 , which reduces the widths by 3 orders .",
    "the calculations which are based on the assumption that the newly discovered @xmath120 and @xmath1 are p - wave excited states of @xmath8 and @xmath122 predict their widths to be at order of a few to tens of kev . by contrary ,",
    "if they are four - quark states , or molecular states , there may be more decay channels available , i.e. some modes are not constrained by the ozi rule , thus much larger total widths might be expected in that scenario .",
    "the authors of refs.@xcite , for example , suggested that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are in non-@xmath10 structure ( four - quark states etc . ) , and obtained much larger rates , even though still obviously smaller than the experimental upper bounds .",
