    "@xcite in a modulation - doped @xcite gaas-@xmath0 heterostructure , a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) is present at the interface of @xmath0 and gaas layers .",
    "@xcite this 2deg can be further confined laterally by various confining techniques such as electron - beam lithography @xcite , ion - beam exposure @xcite , or etching @xcite , forming a quasi - one - dimensional system usually called a quantum wire . at present , one widely used confinement method is the split - gate technique @xcite . in a split - gate quantum wire ,",
    "when a sufficiently negative voltage is applied to the metallic gates , electrons are completely depleted from under the gates , leaving a central channel of electrons undepleted . by further increasing the gate voltage negatively ,",
    "the density of electrons in the channel is decreased continuously until the channel pinches off .",
    "such quantum wires display unique fascinating properties which have stimulated many theoretical and experimental studies of their physics .",
    "@xcite because of the sophisticated gating technique and the flexibility of changing the density of electrons by varying the gate voltage , the split - gate quantum wires hold a great potential for realistic applications @xcite .",
    "considerable progress has been made in developing an understanding of the electronic structure of quantum wires theoretically , based on the results of computer simulations and analytic work .",
    "@xcite however , for many systems , particularly those with an exposed semiconductor surface between the split metallic gates , the current understanding is not complete .",
    "for example , it has not been possible to predict accurately the pinchoff voltage of a quantum wire , given the knowledge of the geometric and doping parameters and the history of a given sample .",
    "the pinchoff voltage is the gate voltage at which conduction through the wire ceases .",
    "it is a quantity of considerable practical importance for these devices .    in this paper",
    ", we present a study that addresses such issues . in section  [ sec : model description ]",
    "we describe the basic physical features of gated quantum wires that are included in our model . in sections  [ sec : regimes ] and [ sec : determination ] we point out that three qualitatively different ionization regimes can exist in the doped layer that supplies electrons to the quantum wire , and show how the ionization regime that a particular sample is in can be identified .",
    "we also show how the shallow donor density in the doped layer may be calculated . in section",
    "[ sec : depletion ] we describe the calculation within our model of the depletion voltage for the electron gas under the gates . in section  [ sec : pinchoff ] we calculate the pinchoff voltage of the quantum wire .",
    "this calculation uses a green s function method , which is an extension of the previous theoretical work of davies @xcite but treats the effects of the charges at the exposed semiconductor surface more accurately . in section  [ sec : discussion ] , we take a well - characterized real sample as an example for calculations , and find good quantitative agreement between the calculated and measured depletion and pinchoff voltages both before and after illumination .",
    "we consider an infinitely long split - gate quantum wire whose crossection is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : crossection ] .",
    "the layers from top are the gaas cap , the si - doped @xmath0 , the undoped @xmath0 spacer , and the gaas channel ; their thicknesses are @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , respectively . on top of the gaas cap are two metallic gates with a spatial separation @xmath5 .",
    "the coordinate frame is chosen in such a way that the exposed surface of gaas cap is the @xmath6 plane , and the lateral direction is along the x - axis .    in such quantum wires , electrons donated by the si donors in the doped @xmath0 layer transfer to the @xmath6 plane to fill the surface or interface states , and to the @xmath7 plane to form the 2deg .",
    "this transfer of electrons leaves a positive spatial charge in the doped layer and thus causes the conduction band to bend within the heterostructure .",
    "one possible case of the band bending is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : regime c ] .",
    "the curve depicts to the bottom of the conduction band along the z - axis . within the cap and the spacer layers ,",
    "the curve is linear because there is no spatial charge in these layers . in the doped layer , however , the bottom of the conduction band is curved because of the presence of the spatial charge .",
    "the curve is parabolic if the spatial charge density is uniform .",
    "@xmath8 is the conduction band offset which occurs at the two interfaces between the gaas and @xmath0 layers .",
    "the whole system shown is in equilibrium , that is , the system has a uniform fermi energy .",
    "( this may change when a voltage is applied between the gates and 2deg , as is discussed below . )",
    "note that , in the situation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : regime c ] , there is an unionized region in the doped layer where the conduction band is flat because donors are not ionized there .",
    "a detailed discussion of the features of our model now follows .",
    "our theoretical model of split - gate quantum wires has four key features .",
    "* feature 1 ) the si donors are uniformly distributed in the @xmath9 doped layer and divided into two categories : the shallow levels and the deep levels .",
    "we assume that electrons are donated only by the ionized shallow donors whose bound energy levels are above the fermi level .",
    "deep donors can be ionized by illumination . *",
    "it is well - known that the electronic state associated with a shallow donor in @xmath0 has the hydrogenic form and can be handled with the effective mass theory @xcite .",
    "neglecting central cell effects , the binding energy of a shallow donor is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the effective mass of the electron and @xmath12 is the dielectric constant . in @xmath0 ,",
    "the @xmath13 valley of the conduction band is the lowest one when @xmath14 . in quantum wires",
    ", @xmath15 is usually in this regime . at the mininum point of the @xmath13 valley ,",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 mev correspondingly .",
    "such a binding energy of shallow donors has been verified by various measurements @xcite . because @xmath18 is much less than other relevant parameters such as the schottky barrier and the conduction band offset",
    ", we consider @xmath18 to be negligible small .    in the doped @xmath0 layer , when @xmath19 , the ground state of a si donor is the deep level instead of the shallow level .",
    "@xcite it is now generally accepted that the deep level is associated with a local lattice distortion which is usually called a dx center @xcite . during illumination ,",
    "a deep donor may absorb a photon and thus ionize . at low temperatures , however ,",
    "a shallow donor can not change into a deep donor automatically because of the energy barrier associated with the lattice distortion .",
    "this argument is supported by many studies such as persistent - photoconductivity experiments @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we have @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 are the total , shallow , and deep donor concentrations , respectively . for a quantum wire",
    ", @xmath21 can be obtained from the fabrication parameters but @xmath22 and @xmath23 are undetermined experimentally .",
    "this has made it difficult to analyze quantum wires theoretically because @xmath22 determines the number of donated electrons and the spatial charge density .",
    "however , we will describe a method to calculate @xmath22 within our model .",
    "* feature 2 ) the schottky barrier between the metallic gates and the gaas cap is determined by the type of the gate metal and the type of gaas interface , and is independent of the gate voltage .",
    "the surface states of the exposed gaas surface are pinned at a single energy level within the forbidden band gap of gaas .",
    "the surface states are localized and surface electrons have a low mobility . *",
    "the schottky barrier of a metal - semiconductor contact refers to the energy difference between the conduction band minima of the semiconductor at the interface and the fermi level of electrons in the metal .",
    "it is generally believed @xcite that schottky barriers are associated with the metal - induced gap states which depend only on the type of the contact metal and the type of the semiconductor interface .",
    "this means that , in quantum wires , the schottky barrier between the gates and the gaas cap is independent of the gate voltage . for ( 100 ) and ( 110 ) interfaces of gaas , the schottky barriers for many metals have been measured @xcite .",
    "the surface states of gaas are associated with the dangling bonds at the exposed surface .",
    "the physics of surface states is complicated and there has been no generally accepted model yet .",
    "@xcite however , experiments show that the surface states of gaas are pinned at a single energy value within the forbidden band gap as long as the surface is covered by a fraction of an adatom monolayer .",
    "@xcite for example , the surface states of the n - type gaas ( 100 ) surface are pinned at about 0.8 ev below the bulk conduction band minima .",
    "@xcite some calculations @xcite also show that the surface states are very localized , which means that the surface electrons have a very low mobility .",
    "the schottky barrier of the exposed surface refers to the energy difference between the conduction band minima and the pinned surface level ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : regime c ] ) . in the following discussion ,",
    "we use @xmath24 for the schottky barrier of the exposed surface and @xmath25 for the schottky barrier of the metal - gaas contact .",
    "* feature 3 ) the energy barrier due to the spacer layer is small .",
    "therefore we assume that the electrons on either sides of it are always in equilibrium with each other .",
    "the energy barrier that separates the surface electrons is so high that tunneling of electrons through it can be neglected .",
    "therefore we assume that the total number of surface electrons is conserved when the gate voltage varies . *",
    "this feature can be justified by that the tunneling current of electrons through an energy barrier is proportional to the tunneling probability of an electron through the barrier . in the wkb approximation , the tunneling probability of an electron at the fermi level is @xmath26,\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the conduction band minimum ( refer to fig .  [",
    "fig : regime c ] ) . because the energy barrier due to the spacer in a typical quantum wire is small ( @xmath28 nm and @xmath29 ev typically )",
    ", the corresponding tunneling current is so large that it keeps electrons on both sides in equilibrium no matter how the gate voltage changes . on the other hand ,",
    "the barrier at the exposed surface is very high ( @xmath30 nm , @xmath31 nm , and @xmath32 ev typically ) , therefore the corresponding tunneling current is so small that the surface electrons are isolated and the total number of the surface electrons is conserved although the gate voltage changes .    * feature 4 ) we assume that , after a quantum wire has been fabricated and no gate voltage is applied , the surface electrons share the same fermi energy with the 2deg .",
    "we also assume that this equilibrium also holds after the quantum wire undergoes illumination at the zero gate voltage . *",
    "this assumption is based on the consideration that the high - temperature ( @xmath33 500 k ) fabrication process provides the conditions necessary for the whole system to reach equilibrium .",
    "that is , the surface electrons share the same fermi energy with the rest of the system .",
    "after the quantum wire is illuminated , the surface electrons do not necessarily stay in equilibrium with the others .",
    "however , by assuming the equilibrium of the whole system after illumination , we have a starting point for calculation of the effect that an illumination has on the quantum wires .",
    "moreover , we speculate that the real situation of quantum wires after an illumination by photons with energies larger than @xmath24 is not too far from an equilibrium state , and therefore the evaluated results should provide useful information .    based on the four features presented above , we are able to set up the electrostatic formalism for any quantum wire system and make predictions .",
    "however , we need first to determine the shallow donor density @xmath22 , which is not directly known from the sample fabrication conditions or from experimental measurements .",
    "we find that @xmath22 can be determined from @xmath34 , the 2deg density at the zero gate voltage , which can be obtained by extrapolating the densities measured from edge state backscattering experiments  @xcite to zero gate voltage .",
    "however , the relation between @xmath22 and @xmath34 depends on the ionization regime of shallow donors in the doped @xmath0 layer .",
    "therefore , we need to analyze the ionization regimes of the doped layer at zero gate voltage .",
    "the ionization regimes here refer to the spatial arrangement of the ionized shallow donors in the doped layer , and to the way that the donated electrons are distributed between the 2deg and the surface states , at zero gate voltage . for the quantum wire shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : crossection ] , there are three ionization regimes .    in ionization regime a , the band bending is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : regimes ab]a . in this regime ,",
    "all of the shallow donors in the doped layer are ionized and no 2deg is present . because the bottom of the conduction band in the gaas channel layer is higher than the surface ( interface ) levels , all donated electrons transfer to the @xmath6 plane to fill the surface ( interface ) states .",
    "the electrons accumulated at the @xmath6 plane in effect form a ` capacitor ' with the positively ionized donors in the doped layer . thus the conduction band in the gaas channel layer is not affected by the transfer of electrons and remains flat .",
    "the ionization of the doped layer falls into this regime when the shallow donor density is very low .    in ionization regime b ,",
    "the band bending is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : regimes ab]b . in this regime",
    ", all the shallow donors in the doped layer are ionized and a 2deg is formed at the @xmath35 plane .",
    "note that the curved conduction band within the doped layer has a minimum point m which divides the whole doped layer into two parts , with thicknesses @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "because the electric field at m is zero , one may consider all of the donated electrons from the region to the left of m to transfer to the @xmath6 plane thus form a ` capacitor ' , while all the donated electrons to the right of m transfer to the @xmath35 plane to form another ` capacitor ' .",
    "these two capacitors have no interaction each other because each screens itself completely .",
    "such a consideration enables us to discuss each capacitor separately .",
    "ionization regime c is the most complicated and its band bending structure is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : regime c ] .",
    "regime c differs from regime b by the presence of an _ unionized region _ in the doped layer . in the unionized region ,",
    "the bound levels of shallow donors are not above the fermi level , thus the electrons in this region are not ionized and remain bound to the donors .",
    "correspondingly , the whole doped layer is divided into three parts .",
    "the left hand one forms one ` capacitor ' with the surface ( interface ) electrons , the right hand one forms another ` capacitor ' with the 2deg , and the central one is charge neutral with its conduction band being flat .",
    "the ionization occurs in regime c when the shallow donor density is very high .    for the quantum wire shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : crossection ] with fixed geometric dimensions , as the shallow density increases , the ionization of the doped layer progresses from regime a to b , to c. in studying quantum wires , however , we are only interested in the ionization regimes b and c when the 2deg is present .",
    "usually the ionization is in regime b before illumination and in regime c after sufficient illumination , because the shallow donor density is increased by illumination .    to identify the ionization regime of a particular quantum wire at the zero gate voltage , we need to calculate the critical characteristic parameters .",
    "notice that since the exposed surface schottky barrier @xmath24 and the metal - gaas contact schottky barrier @xmath25 may be quite different , we have to calculate the critical parameters under the gates and under the exposed surface separately .",
    "for under the exposed surface , let @xmath38 be the critical shallow donor density that divides regimes a and b , and @xmath39 be the one that divides regimes b and c. under the gates , let @xmath40 and @xmath41 be the corresponding critical parameters",
    ".    now let us calculate @xmath38 and @xmath39 . when @xmath42 , the bottom of conduction band in the gaas channel layer ( the region denoted ` flat ' in fig .  [",

    "the two band offsets at @xmath44 and @xmath35 cancel each other .",

    ", the 2deg density @xmath34 at zero gate voltage can readily be determined experimentally .",

    "the depletion voltage @xmath54 is the gate voltage at which electrons of the 2deg are completely depleted from under the gates .",
    "the depletion voltage is an important parameter because it characterizes the transition of the system of electrons at the @xmath35 plane from two - dimensional to quasi - one - dimensional .",
    "the gate voltage actually measures the energy difference between the fermi level in the gates and the fermi level in the gaas at @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , ( noting that @xmath55 at depletion ) , the depletion voltage is given by @xmath56 where the first term on the right side gives the total band bending in the cap and the doped layers , and @xmath25 is the schottky barrier of the gate - gaas contact . note that @xmath22 should be determined from the measured 2deg density @xmath34 according to the ionization regime at the zero gate voltage . from equation  [ eq : vdep ]",
    ", the depletion voltage should be independent of illumination because @xmath22 of the regions in the doped layer that are under the gates is not affected by illumination .",

    "corresponding to these three situations , the measured densities of the 2deg at zero gate voltage are @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 , respectively . comparing these measured values to the calculated critical value @xmath101 and referring to table  [ tab : parameters ] , the ionization regimes of this quantum wire before illumination , after one illumination , and after many illuminations are in b , b , and c , respectively .",
    "the corresponding shallow donor densities and the depletion voltage and pinchoff voltages can therefore be calculated based on the formalism in section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "the calculated results are presented in table  [ tab : results ] .",
    "experimentally , the depletion and pinchoff voltages can be known from the measured longitudinal ( y - direction ) resistances against the gate voltage .",
    "@xcite the measured resistance curves of the sample quantum wire are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : resistances ] . curves a , b , and c correspond to the resistances varying with the gate voltage before illumination , after one illumination , and after many illuminations , respectively .",
    "the depletion voltages for curves a , b , and c are @xmath1050.33 v , @xmath1050.35 v and @xmath1050.37 v , respectively , which agree very well with the calculated results @xmath1050.33 v. ( the negative increases of depletion voltage upon illumination can be explained by the fact that the gate bars are very narrow and therefore some illuminating photons may penetrate into the regions under the gates and excite the deep donor there . )",
    "the pinchoff voltages read from curves a , b , and c are about @xmath1050.55 v , @xmath1050.86 v , and @xmath1051.33 v , respectively , which are fairly close to their corresponding calculated results @xmath1050.53 v , @xmath1050.80 v , and @xmath1051.43 v.    in conclusion , this paper presents an electrostatic model of split - gate quantum wires and sets up a general formalism that is applicable both before and after illumination . for any split - gate quantum wire , given its geometric parameters and its measured 2deg density at zero gate voltage , additional information such as its ionization state , shallow donor density , depletion voltage , and pinchoff voltage can be calculated based on the model .",
    "while contributing to our understanding of the electrostatic characteristics of quantum wires , this model suggests a potential approach for studying the electrodynamic and time - dependent processes in quantum wires .",
    "the theory of this paper should also provide a tool for study other gated nanostructures such as multiple constrictions @xcite and quantum dots @xcite .",
