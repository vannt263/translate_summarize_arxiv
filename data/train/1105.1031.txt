    "the local red dwarf gliese 581 ( 20.3 ly from the sun , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , spectral type m3v ) @xcite has received intense interest over the last decade due to the low mass exoplanets discovered around it . as of early 2011",
    "it has been reported to host up to six planets @xcite .",
    "one of these , gj581 g , was announced in september 2010 and estimated to be in the habitable zone ( the orbital range in which a planet s atmosphere can warm the surface sufficiently to allow surface liquid water ) @xcite .",
    "however , its discovery has been strongly disputed by other researchers , including the team responsible for finding the other four planets in the system @xcite . for the moment , therefore , gj581 g remains unconfirmed .",
    "gj581d , in constrast , which was first discovered in 2007 and has a minimum mass between 5.6 and 7.1 @xmath4 , has now been robustly confirmed by radial velocity ( rv ) observations @xcite . due to its greater distance from the host star , gj581d was initially regarded as unlikely to have surface liquid water unless strong warming mechanisms due to e.g. , co@xmath0 clouds @xcite were present in its atmosphere .",
    "recently , simple one - dimensional radiative - convective studies @xcite have suggested that a dense atmosphere could provide a significant greenhouse effect on gj581d .",
    "however , the planet s tidal evolution poses a key problem for its habitability .",
    "as it is most likely either in a pseudo - synchronous state with a rotation period that is a function of the eccentricity , or in spin - orbit resonance like mercury in our solar system @xcite , gj581d should have extremely low insolation at its poles and possibly a permanent night side .",
    "regions of low or zero insolation on a planet can act as cold traps where volatiles such as h@xmath0o and co@xmath0 freeze out on the surface .",
    "a few previous studies @xcite have examined atmospheric collapse in 3d with simplified radiative transfer , but only for earth - like atmospheric pressures or lower ( 0.1 to 1.5 bar ) . for low values of stellar insolation and large planetary radii , even dense co@xmath0 atmospheres will be prone to collapse , which could rule out a stable water cycle altogether for a super - earth like gj581d . to conclusively evaluate whether gj581d is in the habitable zone , therefore , three - dimensional simulations using accurate radiative transfer are necessary .    here",
    "we present global climate model ( gcm ) simulations we performed to assess this issue . in section [ sec : method ]",
    "we describe the model used . in section [ sec : results ] we describe our results , and in section [ sec : conc ] we discuss implications and propose future observational tests for the simulated habitable scenarios .",
    "in our simulations we made the initial hypothesis that gj581d has a climate dominated by the greenhouse effects of co@xmath0 and / or h@xmath0o , as is the case for all rocky planets with atmospheres in the solar system ( venus , earth and mars ) . to assess the influence of water on the climate independently , we considered two classes of initial condition : a rocky planet with no water , and an ocean planet , where the surface is treated as an infinite water source .",
    "co@xmath0 was taken as the primary constituent of the atmosphere and h@xmath0o was allowed to vary freely , with surface ice / liquid and cloud formation ( including radiative effects ) taken into account for either gas when necessary .",
    "restricting the composition of the atmosphere to two species in this way allows us to determine conservative conditions for habitability , as it neglects the warming due to other greenhouse gases like ch@xmath5 or buffer gases like n@xmath0 or ar @xcite .",
    "the simulations were performed using a new type of gcm that we developed specifically for exoplanet and paleoclimate studies .",
    "it uses radiative transfer data generated directly from high resolution spectra , which allows the accurate simulation of climates for essentially any atmospheric cocktail of gases , aerosols and clouds for which optical data exists . the dynamical core of the model was adapted from the lmd mars gcm , which uses an enstrophy and total angular momentum conserving finite difference scheme @xcite .",
    "scale - selective hyperdiffusion was used in the horizontal plane for stability .",
    "the planetary boundary layer was parameterised using the method of @xcite to calculate turbulent mixing , with the latent heat of h@xmath0o also taken into account in the surface temperature calculations when necessary .",
    "a standard roughness coefficient of @xmath6 m was used for both rocky and ocean surfaces for simplicity , although we verified that our results were insensitive to variations in this parameter .",
    "spatial resolution of @xmath7 in longitude , latitude and altitude was used for all simulations ; we performed one comparison test at the highest rotation rate with @xmath8 resolution and found that the differences were small .",
    "our radiative transfer scheme was similar to that we developed previously for one - dimensional simulations @xcite . for a given mixture of atmospheric gases , we computed high resolution spectra over a range of temperatures , pressures and gas mixing ratios . for this study we used a 6 @xmath9 9 @xmath9 7 temperature , pressure and h@xmath0o volume mixing ratio grid with values @xmath10 k , @xmath11 mbar and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the correlated-@xmath13 method was used to produce a smaller database of coefficients suitable for fast calculation in a gcm .",
    "the model used 38 spectral bands in the longwave and 36 in the shortwave , and sixteen points for the @xmath14-space integration , where @xmath14 is the cumulated distribution function of the absorption data for each band . in most simulations co@xmath0",
    "was assumed to be the main constituent of the atmosphere , except the locally habitable ice planet experiments ( see section [ sec : results ] ) , where n@xmath0 was used .",
    "co@xmath0 collision - induced absorption was included using a parameterisation based on the most recent theoretical and experimental studies @xcite . for the stellar spectrum , we used the virtual planet laboratory ad leo data @xcite .",
    "ad leo is a m - class star with effective temperature @xmath15  k , which is acceptably close to the most recent estimates of @xmath16  k @xcite for the purposes of climate modelling .",
    "a two - stream scheme @xcite was used to account for the radiative effects of both clouds and rayleigh scattering , as in @xcite .    in the water cycle and cloud modelling ,",
    "care was taken to ensure that the parameterisations used were based on physical principles and not tuned to earth - specific conditions .",
    "when this was not possible ( as for e.g. , the density of condensable cloud nuclei in the atmosphere @xmath17 ) , we tested the sensitivity of our results to variations in those parameters .",
    "three tracer species were used in our simulations : co@xmath0 ice , h@xmath0o ice and h@xmath0o vapour .",
    "tracers were freely advected in the atmosphere , subject to changes due to sublimation / evaporation and condensation and interaction with the surface . for both gases ,",
    "condensation was assumed to occur when the atmospheric temperature dropped below the saturation temperature .",
    "local mean co@xmath0 and h@xmath0o cloud particle sizes were determined from the amount of condensed material and the density of condensable nuclei @xmath18 .",
    "this parameter was set to @xmath19 kg@xmath20 in most of our simulations ; we tested the effect of varying it over the range @xmath21 to @xmath22 kg@xmath20 and found that the maximum difference in mean surface temperature after 60 orbits was less than 5 k. as a further test of the robustness of our results , we also performed some tests with cloud radiative effects removed altogether ( see section 3 ) .",
    "ice particles of both species were sedimented according to stokes law @xcite . below the stratosphere , adjustment was used to relax temperatures due to convection and / or condensation of co@xmath0 and h@xmath0o .",
    "for h@xmath0o , moist and large - scale convection were taken into account following @xcite .",
    "precipitation of h@xmath0o due to coagulation was also included using a simple threshold parameterisation @xcite .    on the surface , the local albedo varied according to the composition ( rocky , ocean , co@xmath0 or h@xmath0o ice ; see table [ tab : params ] ) . in the wet simulations , ice formation ( melting )",
    "was assumed to occur when the surface temperature was lower ( higher ) than 273 k , and temperature changes due to the latent heat of fusion were taken into account .",
    "in all cases , the simulations were run until collapse / glaciation occurred or steady states of thermal equilibrium were reached . the time taken to reach thermal equilibrium",
    "can be estimated from the atmospheric radiative relaxation timescale @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , g , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the specific heat capacity of the atmosphere , the mean surface pressure , the surface gravity , the atmospheric emission temperature and the stefan - boltzmann constant , respectively . taking @xmath28 k , @xmath29 j k@xmath20 kg@xmath20 , @xmath30 bar and @xmath31 m s@xmath32 yields @xmath33 earth days ( 60 gj581d orbits ) .",
    "this was close to the timescales we observed in the model by plotting time series of mean surface temperature .",
    "we used the minimum mass for gj581d given by @xcite instead of the smaller value ( @xmath34 ) proposed by @xcite .",
    "we took the actual mass of gj581d to be @xmath35 , given that the statistically most probable value for the inclination angle is 60@xmath36 .",
    "radius and gravity for rocky and ocean / ice cases ( table [ tab : params ] ) were then determined from theoretical models @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "the assumed bulk composition of the planet was 50% h@xmath0o .",
    "model tests using @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( the latter value comes from dynamical stability considerations @xcite ) did not reveal significant differences from our main results .    to produce emission spectra , we recorded top - of - atmosphere longitude - latitude maps of outgoing fluxes computed by the gcm over one orbit . inclination angle of the orbit relative to the observer was assumed to be @xmath39 .",
    "an isotropic ( lambertian ) distribution of specific intensities at the top of the atmosphere was assumed ; comparison with a line - by - line radiative transfer code at wavelengths where the limb - darkening was most pronounced revealed that the disk - integrated flux error due to this effect was below 5% .",
    "we performed simulations with 5 , 10 , 20 and 30 bar atmospheric pressure and 1:1 , 1:2 and 1:10 orbit - rotation resonances for both rocky and ocean planets ( see table 1 ) .",
    "eccentricity was set to zero in the simulations we present here , with the stellar flux set to the true value at @xmath40 and not increased to account for orbital averaging as in our 1d study @xcite .",
    "however , we also performed tests with @xmath41 and found that eccentricity was not critical to the results .",
    "similarly , we assumed zero obliquity to assess the likelihood of atmospheric collapse in the most severe cases , but sensistivity tests showed that its influence on the climate was second order at the high pressures where the atmosphere remained stable .",
    "co@xmath0 gas had a powerful greenhouse warming effect in our simulations because gj581d orbits a red dwarf star . in the solar system ,",
    "rayleigh scattering reflects the bluer incoming starlight much more effectively , and hence a planet receiving the same flux as gj581d would be uninhabitable for any co@xmath0 pressure . in our rocky simulations , for pressures below @xmath4210 bar",
    "the atmosphere was indeed unstable , and began to condense on the dark side and / or poles of the planet ( fig .",
    "however , for denser atmospheres , we found that horizontal heat transport and greenhouse warming became effective enough to remove the threat of collapse and allow surface temperatures above the melting point of water ( fig .",
    "1 ) . rotation rate affected the atmospheric stability through both the insolation ( the planet has permanent day and night sides in the most extreme 1:1 resonance case ) and the horizontal heat transport ( faster rotating atmospheres were less efficient at transporting heat polewards ) .    even in the stable simulations , some co@xmath0 usually condensed in the middle atmosphere ( fig .",
    "3 ) , leading to co@xmath0 ice cloud formation as occurs on present - day mars @xcite .",
    "co@xmath0 clouds typically had a net warming effect ( up to 12 k ) , depending on the cloud microphysical assumptions , due to the scattering of infrared radiation from the ground @xcite . to check the robustness of our results",
    ", we also performed tests with the ( unrealistic ) assumption of no co@xmath0 cloud radiative effects , and found that the atmospheres were colder , but still stable above around 10 bar .    in the ocean planet simulations",
    ", we neglected all oceanic horizontal heat transport .",
    "this assumption led us to overestimate global temperature differences and hence the probability of atmospheric collapse , in keeping with the aim of a conservative habitability estimate .",
    "we found that atmospheric h@xmath0o vapour greatly increased warming , while h@xmath0o cloud formation low in the atmosphere tended to cool the planet by increasing the planetary albedo ( fig .",
    "this led to a transition in the climate as total pressure increased . at 10 bar and below , cooling effects dominated and runaway glaciation occurred , followed by atmospheric collapse . from 20 bar ,",
    "the positive feedback of water vapour on greenhouse warming raised mean temperatures significantly compared with the rocky case ( fig .",
    "2b ) . in the intermediate region ,",
    "climate stability was difficult to assess as surface temperature trends were extremely small ( as low as a few k per 100 orbits in some cases ) .",
    "there , our results were somewhat sensitive to our microphysical assumptions ; for example , lowering the precipitation threshold @xmath43 ( see table 1 ) resulted in optically thinner h@xmath0o clouds and stable , cooler climates at lower total pressures . nonetheless , at higher pressures we found stable , hot climates with little global temperature variations even in the tidally locked cases , regardless of the choice of microphysical parameters .",
    "we investigated the effect of starting with a surface covered by h@xmath0o ice .",
    "for the dense atmospheres where the climate was stable , this only weakly changed the planetary albedo , and the ice melted for pressures of 20 bar or more .",
    "hence the runaway ( h@xmath0o ) glaciation that is possible on earth @xcite would be unlikely to occur on an ocean - planet gj581d .",
    "our results here contrast with those of @xcite , who used a 1d energy balance model to investigate the effects of obliquity on planetary habitability , because they neglected the dependence of planetary albedo on the total pressure in dense atmospheres .",
    "we also investigated the possibility that an ice - covered , tidally locked gj581d with permanent day and night sides could be locally habitable on the day side due to partial melting .",
    "however in this scenario , the day side only stayed warm when the atmosphere was thin and hence inefficient at transporting heat .",
    "as a result , the planet s dark side became cold enough for the collapse of even an n@xmath0 atmosphere .",
    "an ice planet with only a thin sublimation - driven h@xmath0o atmosphere could have dayside temperatures above 273 k and continual transport of h@xmath0o to the dark side , but the low atmospheric pressure would preclude liquid water except in extremely limited sub - surface regions .",
    "clearly , dense , stable atmospheres offer better prospects for habitability .",
    "are co@xmath0 partial pressures of over 10 bar a realistic possibility for gj581d ? given the planet s assumed gravity , this corresponds to a co@xmath0 column of only 4 to 6 bars on earth . even though venus and earth are smaller , their total co@xmath0 inventories scaled by planetary mass are around 10 - 100 times greater than this . on venus",
    ", it is thought that a large fraction of this inventory is in the atmosphere @xcite , while on earth , the atmospheric partial pressure is regulated over geological timescales by the carbonate - silicate cycle @xcite via plate tectonics .",
    "the geophysics of gj581d is unknown , but if a similar mechanism were present there , its atmospheric co@xmath0 would stabilize above the level needed to maintain a liquid water cycle by negative feedback .    co@xmath0-h@xmath0o-(buffer gas ) atmospheres are clearly only a subset of all the possible scenarios for gj581d .",
    "if small quantities of additional greenhouse gases such as ch@xmath5 or so@xmath0 were present , they would increase warming further .",
    "however , if these gases were chemically unstable , they would need to be continually emitted by e.g. , volcanic or biological sources to have a long - term effect on the climate .",
    "more drastically , the planet could have a thick h@xmath0-he envelope like uranus or neptune , or its atmosphere could have been removed entirely by increased stellar activity early in the life of the host star .",
    "both scenarios would exclude surface liquid water ( the former through an excess of surface pressure ) .",
    "gj581d s large mass means that it can retain an atmosphere more easily than earth or venus , but the increased xuv and ion fluxes from m - class stars early in their history means that removal processes can be much more efficient than in the solar system @xcite .",
    "the escape of atmospheric hydrogen depends sensitively on both xuv flux levels and radiative cooling by h@xmath44 ions , both of which are poorly constrained for gj581d @xcite . moreover , stripping by the stellar wind , which does not discriminate between light and heavy atoms ,",
    "could have removed large amounts of any gas ( including co@xmath0 ) @xcite .",
    "detailed modelling of atmospheric escape may be able to constrain the effects of these processes on the atmosphere further .    unlike the majority of the kepler planetary candidates , gliese 581d is relatively close to earth",
    ", so in the future it will be possible to establish which scenario applies to it through direct spectroscopic observations . to determine the sensitivity required for this",
    ", we used the outgoing longwave radiation ( olr ) from our simulations to produce synthetic emission spectra for the habitable climates just discussed , along with those for a planet with no atmosphere ( fig .",
    "4 ) . we did not calculate emission spectra for the h@xmath0-he dominated case , but equilibrium chemistry calculations allowed us to establish that for an atmosphere where h@xmath0 is the dominant species by mass , the abundance of co@xmath0 should be below the limit of detectability . for a rocky / icy planet",
    "where volatiles like co@xmath0 have collapsed on the surface and the atmosphere is thin or non - existent , the flux variations over one orbit will be large ( grey region in fig . [",
    "fig : spectra ] ) .",
    "observations of co@xmath0 and h@xmath0o absorption bands with low phase variations ( red / blue regions in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] ) would hence be a strong indicator of the kind of stable , dense habitable atmospheres discussed in this paper . from fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] , the flux sensitivity necessary for this in the infrared will be of order 10@xmath45 w m@xmath32 @xmath46m@xmath20 , corresponding to a planet / star ratio lower than @xmath47 for wavelengths @xmath48 20  @xmath46 m .",
    "this is beyond the capabilities of current space and ground - based observatories , but it will become possible with future improvements in instrumental technology .",
