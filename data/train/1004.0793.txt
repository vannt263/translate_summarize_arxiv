    "communication channels have become ubiquitous in control applications such as remotely operated robotic systems @xcite . in such applications , measurement and control signals",
    "are exchanged via a lossy and noisy communication channels , which makes the system a _ networked control system _ ( ncs ) .",
    "the research in ncs has branched into many different directions that deal with the effects of delays , limited information exchanged , and information losses on the stability of the plant , see , e.g. , @xcite and the references therein .",
    "control under information loss in the communication channel has been extensively studied within the linear quadratic gaussian ( lqg ) framework @xcite .",
    "typically , the communication channel(s ) are modeled by an independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d ) bernoulli process , which assign probabilities to the successful transmission of packets . perhaps the most well known result in this setting is : when the transmission of sensor and control data packets happens over a network with tcp - like protocols , the closed - loop system under lqg controller can be mean - square stabilized provided that the probabilities of successful transmission are above a certain threshold .",
    "since the tcp - like protocols enable the receiver to obtain an acknowledgment of whether or not the packets were successfully transmitted , the separation principle holds and the optimal lqg controller is linear in the estimated state .",
    "thus , this result is a proper generalization of the classical lqg control problem to the networked control setting .    within the lqg setting ,",
    "control inputs are not assumed bounded and therefore linear state feedback is a permissible and optimal strategy .",
    "however , guaranteeing hard bounds on the control inputs is of paramount importance in applications .",
    "consequently , many researchers have pursued the problem of optimal control and stabilization for linear systems with bounded control inputs @xcite .",
    "this problem has also received a renewed interest in recent years @xcite . in the deterministic setting , it is well - known @xcite that global asymptotic stabilization of a linear system @xmath0 is possible if and only if the pair @xmath1 is stabilizable under arbitrary controls and the spectral radius of the system matrix @xmath2 is at most @xmath3 . in the stochastic setting , it was argued in @xcite that ensuring a mean - square bound for every initial condition is not possible for linear systems with bounded control elements if the system matrix @xmath2 is unstable . in @xcite",
    "we established the existence of a policy with sufficiently large control authority that ensures mean - square boundedness of the states of the system under the assumption that @xmath2 is lyapunov stable .",
    "although lyapunov stability of @xmath2 is a stronger requirement than the spectral radius of @xmath2 being at most @xmath3 , to the best of our knowledge , this is the current state of the art .    in this article",
    "we generalize the results of @xcite to incorporate noisy control channels .",
    "we consider mean - square boundedness of stochastic linear systems under the following specification :    * the communication channel between the controller and the system actuators is noisy whereas the communication channel between sensors and controller is noiseless , and * hard constraints on the control inputs must be satisfied .",
    "we are thus concerned with a networked setting as proposed in @xcite when generalized to incorporate bounded control inputs  @xcite .",
    "the control input @xmath4 for the @xmath5-th plant is communicated to the corresponding plant actuator via a lossy communication channel , which is characterized by the noise @xmath6 affecting the control input multiplicatively as shown in figure [ fig : topology ] .",
