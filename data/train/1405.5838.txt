    "true `` self - interacting random walks ( as opposed to static models like the self - avoiding walk of polymer physics ) are an important class of non - markovian kinetic processes with long range memory @xcite . reinforced random walks are self - attracting processes where",
    ", typically , a random walker tends to preferentially revisit the nearest - neighbor sites that it has visited before ( or , in a variant , recross the edges already crossed ) . in the last few decades ,",
    "reinforced random walks have received a particular attention , not only for the mathematical challenges they raise , but also for their applications to biology @xcite .",
    "these walks have been used for the description of the displacements of ants or bacteria @xcite . in ecology",
    ", they can also represent simple models of site fidelity '' , a behavior observed in many animals in the wild @xcite .",
    "many reinforced walk models are defined through transition probabilities that depend on the number of visits ( or crossings ) received by the sites ( or edges ) and the resulting dynamics is thus strongly path - dependent .",
    "some rigorous results have been obtained for certain reinforcement rules , showing that different dynamical behaviors can emerge depending on the strength of memory and the spatial dimension .",
    "a single walker may asymptotically become localized ( keeping oscillating between a few sites ) , or diffusive , in which the range of its position @xmath1 is infinite and the origin visited infinitely often in @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations actually show that a variety of models seems to exhibit a phase transition at finite reinforcement between a localized and a diffusive regime @xcite .",
    "interestingly , in the diffusive regime , the same studies have presented evidence that diffusion is anomalous , namely , subdiffusive .",
    "this type of motion , widely studied in markovian contexts @xcite , is characterized by a mean square displacement ( msd ) of the particle which does not follow the smoluchowski - einstein law of brownian motion , but a slower one , of the form @xmath3 with @xmath4 an exponent @xmath5 .",
    "few random walk models with long range memory are analytically tractable @xcite . for a single particle ,",
    "path - dependent diffusion is notoriously difficult to formalize and many results on reinforced random walks are based on numerical simulations .",
    "usually , such processes can not be described by a master equation for the single - time occupation probability ( or propagator ) .",
    "instead , they require the introduction of multiple - time distribution functions , that are related to each other via a hierarchy of relations .",
    "path integral approaches @xcite or approximate scaling arguments @xcite have been developed to overcome these difficulties .",
    "nonlinear integro - differential fokker - planck equations can also be derived within a mean - field approximation @xcite .",
    "this latter approach can give a fairly good picture of the phase diagram but remains limited for a precise dynamical description .",
    "the recent ecological literature reveals a regain of interest for reinforced random walks .",
    "thanks to spectacular advances in tracking technology , the positions of individual animals @xcite , including humans @xcite , can be recorded with a high resolution and during long periods of time . recently",
    ", random walk models with memory have successfully explained some features of the trajectories of humans @xcite , monkeys @xcite or bisons @xcite , which all exhibit strong recurrence , an anomalous slow diffusion and an heterogeneous occupation of space .",
    "other theoretical studies have identified memory as a key factor for the emergence of home ranges , that is , a restricted space use @xcite .",
    "reinforced random walks thus offer a promising alternative to markovian random walks , which remain the dominant modeling paradigm in movement ecology @xcite .",
    "however , most models developed so far are computational and we still lack a basic understanding of the effects of memory on mobility patterns , even in simple cases . for this purpose , it is desirable , in parallel with ecologically realistic computational approaches , to gain knowledge from the mathematical analysis of very simple models .    here",
    ", we exactly solve in the asymptotic time limit a reinforced model , that generalizes the one presented in @xcite , where a random walker intermittently relocates to sites visited in the past .",
    "we obtain not only the behavior of the msd , but also the properties of the propagator or diffusion front , a quantity which is almost unknown for single reinforced walks .",
    "in contrast with usual reinforced models , here the walker s steps are not necessarily directed to nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "this property has two advantages : it agrees with the empirical fact that many animals and humans actually perform long , intermittent commuting bouts to visit places that are beyond their perception range @xcite , and it also greatly simplifies the mathematical analysis since an exact master equation can be written in this case .",
    "depending on a memory parameter , we find that motion can be brownian or subdiffusive .",
    "two subdiffusive regimes are identified , with power - law and logarithmic dynamics , respectively .",
    "somewhat paradoxically , a lvy - like distribution for the length of the steps emerges at the onset of subdiffusion .",
    "we thus suggest that a mechanism based on memory could be at the origin of the lvy flight patterns observed in many animals @xcite .",
    "in addition , the availability of the propagator allows us to discuss in a formal way some analogies and differences between the present model and well - known , essentially markovian models of anomalous diffusion : notably , the continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) of montroll and weiss @xcite , and the scaled brownian motion @xcite .",
    "let us consider a one - dimensional lattice with unit spacing and a walker with position @xmath1 at time @xmath6 .",
    "time is discrete ( @xmath7 ) and the walker starts at the origin , @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath9 be a constant parameter , @xmath10 .",
    "at each time step , @xmath11 , the walker chooses one of the two movement modes :    _ ( i ) _ with probability @xmath12 , the walker performs a random step to a nearest - neighbor site , like in the simple symmetric random walk ;    _ ( ii ) _ with the complementary probability @xmath9 , the walker chooses a random integer @xmath13 in the interval @xmath14 $ ] according to a probability distribution @xmath15 , which is given",
    "_ a priori_. then , the walker directly relocates at the site that it occupied at time @xmath13 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath16 .",
    "these rules are depicted in figure [ fig : model ] .",
    "if , for instance , @xmath15 is uniform , _ i.e. _ , @xmath17 , one recovers the preferential visit model studied in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in this case , the memory rule ( _ ii ) _ is equivalent to revisiting an already visited site , say @xmath18 , with probability proportional to the total amount of time spent by the walker at this site since @xmath19 .",
    "hence , the more visits site @xmath18 receives , more likely it will be chosen for future visits in the memory movement mode .",
    "this is the principle of reinforced random walks . in a different context , similar rules",
    "characterize network growth models with preferential attachment @xcite .",
    "an important difference with usual reinforced random walks is that , here , any of the previously visited sites is susceptible to receive the next visit , and not just the nearest - neighbors of the current position of the walker .",
    "this property considerably simplifies the analysis , which still is not trivial .",
    "note that a markovian limiting case of this model is the random walk with stochastic reseting to the origin @xcite , which corresponds to @xmath20 .",
    "we focus on the propagator @xmath21 of the single particle , which is the probability that @xmath22 given that @xmath8 .",
    "as formally shown in the appendix [ master ] , despite of the fact that our process is highly non - markovian , the evolution of @xmath21 is exactly described through a single master equation : @xmath23 the last term is the probability to choose site @xmath18 using the memory mode .",
    "this term can also be interpreted as proportional to the weighted number of previous visits received by site @xmath18 , where the weight of a visit received at time @xmath13 is @xmath15 . in this study",
    ", we will restrict to the cases where the probability distribution of @xmath13 is of the form @xmath24 .",
    "hence , the memory kernel @xmath25 depends on the time elapsed between the remembered event and the present time , @xmath26 .",
    "the normalization condition @xmath27 at each @xmath6 imposes that : @xmath28 where @xmath29 in the uniform preferential visit model , @xmath30 , _ i.e. _ memory does not decay . here , we are interested in cases where @xmath31 , _ i.e. _ , where recent visits count more than visits performed further in the past , as represented in figure [ fig : model]-bottom .",
    "we will consider a particularly interesting case , namely , scale - free memory decays : @xmath32 with @xmath33 an exponent . if @xmath33 is large , the early time trajectory ( @xmath34 , or @xmath35 large ) tends to be completely forgotten . hence , when the walker uses its memory , it will most likely decide to revisit positions occupied at times proximate to the present time @xmath6 .",
    "but if @xmath33 is small enough , memory becomes long range and may drastically affect the diffusion process , like in the preferential visit model ( @xmath36 ) @xcite .    at a given time @xmath6",
    ", it is natural to define the mean backward jump in time as @xmath37 , or : @xmath38 if @xmath39 in the kernel ( [ fttp ] ) , both sums in eq .",
    "( [ deftau ] ) converge and @xmath40 tends to a constant at large @xmath6 : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the riemann zeta function . in this case",
    ", memory has a finite range and should not affect in an essential way the normal diffusion process .",
    "figure [ fig : relmemtraj ] displays examples of walks generated numerically in @xmath2 in three different cases : @xmath39 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the analytical results presented below are derived in section [ sec : der ] using the following methodology . instead of solving eq.([genreset ] ) , we have considered the moments of @xmath21 , defined by the ensemble averages @xmath45 .",
    "the moments obey simpler equations and carry information on the behavior of the distribution itself .",
    "these equations can be solved in the asymptotic time limit .",
    "we first study the second moment ( @xmath46 ) , _ i.e. _ the mean square displacement ( msd ) . for @xmath47 , we assume that the leading asymptotic term of the msd is of the form @xmath48 and calculate the constants @xmath49 and @xmath4 .",
    "for the case @xmath50 , the correct ansatz is @xmath51 and we determine @xmath49 .",
    "we next assume that @xmath21 obeys a scaling form at large time in each case , see eq.([scalingp ] ) below , which enable us to obtain the asymptotic behavior of all the higher order moments , for any positive integer @xmath52 .",
    "the msd ansatzs and the scaling assumption yield consistent results , which are also checked numerically by simulations or exact time integration of the equations .",
    "we summarize the exact asymptotic results obtained for the msd , which is the second moment of @xmath21 : @xmath54    _ @xmath55 _ if @xmath39 , we have : @xmath56 this result actually applies to any kernel @xmath25 with finite first moment .",
    "thus , diffusion is normal and the main effect of memory is to decrease the diffusion constant compared to that of the memoryless random walk @xmath57 . the larger @xmath9 ( frequent memory use ) and the larger @xmath58 ( better memory ) ,",
    "the slower diffusion is .    _",

    "above , we make a scaling hypothesis for the probability density in the long time limit : @xmath64 where , by construction , @xmath65 is a normalized scaling function ( @xmath66 ) of unit variance ( @xmath67 ) .",

    "its moments satisfy : @xmath78 where @xmath79 note that both ( [ gaussian ] ) and ( [ nongaussian])-([cali ] ) are _ universal _ relations , _ i.e. _ the corresponding limiting distributions @xmath21 do not depend on @xmath9 nor on the details of the memory kernel but only on the fact that @xmath80 at large @xmath35",

    "just before taking this step , the walker was at some distance from the origin , represented by the large circle . in order to reach this circle again from @xmath172 ,",
    "the walker will typically need to diffuse during another time interval @xmath35 again ( assuming stationarity in the process ) .",

    "a higher order calculation shows that , for any @xmath69 : @xmath203 which confirms our previous result that @xmath65 becomes gaussian again at @xmath192 .",
    "an expansion of the moment relation ( [ momentbis ] ) at large @xmath69 and small @xmath4 generalizes eq.([nongaussianlargep ] ) : @xmath204 therefore the exponential behavior of @xmath65 at large @xmath183 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath205 for large @xmath69 ) is avoided at @xmath192 due to the vanishing prefactor and the distribution adopts a gaussian profile instead .",
    "every time the walker uses memory , it performs a relocation step , of length , say , @xmath206 , corresponding to the distance between its current location and the newly chosen site .",
    "these lengths @xmath206 are represented by the thick ( black ) lines in the one dimensional simulations of figure [ fig : relmemtraj ] .",
    "they can be quite large in the subdiffusive regime .",
    "we present below a scaling argument to obtain an expression for the probability distribution of @xmath206 .",
    "since the site occupied after a relocation is the site that was occupied @xmath35 time units ago , one may expect that , typically , @xmath207^{1/2}.\\ ] ] in the case with @xmath39 , we know that @xmath152 thus the random variables @xmath206 and @xmath35 should be related through the scaling relation @xmath208 . denoting @xmath209 the distribution function of @xmath206 , probability conservation implies @xmath210 , where @xmath167 .",
    "hence @xmath211 thus , when @xmath43 , the distribution @xmath209 obeys a lvy - like \" power - law distribution with marginal exponent @xmath212 , which is characterized by an infinite variance @xmath213 .",
    "if @xmath39 , eq . ( [ pell ] ) indicates that the step length distribution exponent is @xmath214 , outside the lvy range , and @xmath215 is therefore finite .",
    "note that , unlike in a genuine lvy process , the steps in the present model are long - range correlated and thus not independent .",
    "consequently , our model exhibits a paradoxical behavior : the divergence of the variance of the relocation length @xmath206 happens at the onset of _",
    "sub_diffusion , and not superdiffusion as in usual lvy flights",
    ". this important feature can be understood by the fact that when the relocation lengths become large , they also become strongly anticorrelated and thus limit the walker s diffusion overall .",
    "the scaling law predicted in ( [ pell ] ) agrees very well with simulation results , as shown in figure [ fig : pl ] .",
    "the case @xmath216 , corresponding to subdiffusive motion , is more complicated and the above argument to obtain @xmath209 is not applicable strictly speaking .",
    "eq.([elltau ] ) may not hold due to non - ergodic effects , which are well known to be strong in subdiffusive processes such as the ctrw @xcite . if we naively assume that ( [ elltau ] ) is correct ( which makes the implicit assumption that the mean square displacement of the walker during an interval of time @xmath35 is independent of the time taken as the origin along the trajectory ) , we have @xmath217 from ( [ elltau ] ) , which gives @xmath218^{-\\beta } \\sim\\ell^{-3}$ ] .",
    "hence , the relocation length distribution would remain at the border of the lvy range for any @xmath59 .    but this prediction is not confirmed by the numerical results of figure [ fig : pl ] , which show that for intermediate values of @xmath206 the distribution @xmath209 decays more slowly than the law @xmath219 .",
    "if we assume that the average displacement @xmath206 taken along the trajectory looks normally diffusive , like in the ordinary ctrw process @xcite , then we should use the scaling @xmath208 instead of @xmath220 .",
    "this relation leads to the same form ( [ pell ] ) obtained for @xmath39 .",
    "thus the step length exponent would be @xmath221 , spanning the whole lvy range @xmath222 as @xmath33 is varied is between 1 and 2 .",
    "the numerical simulations support this qualitative prediction partly .",
    "as displayed by figure [ fig : pl ] , @xmath209 exhibits an intermediate power - law regime with an exponent quite close to @xmath221 ( case @xmath223 ) .",
    "nevertheless the actual distribution seems more complicated than an inverse power - law and it is truncated at large @xmath206 .",
    "scaled brownian motion ( sbm ) is a well - known anomalous diffusion process with gaussian property .",
    "typically , it is simply generated by rescaling the time variable of an ordinary brownian motion as @xmath224 , with @xmath225 a constant ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the diffusion front @xmath21 of a sbm is gaussian , but with variance @xmath226 , instead of @xmath227 in the original process .",
    "consequently , it obeys a fokker - planck equation ( in continuous space ) of the form : @xmath228 with @xmath229 a time - dependent diffusion coefficient , given by @xmath230 .    when @xmath50 in the present model , and in the very long time limit , @xmath21 becomes a gaussian , too , but with variance @xmath231 , where the generalized mobility @xmath232 is given by eq .",
    "( [ vi ] ) . therefore , setting @xmath233 we see that @xmath234 obeys the simple effective diffusion equation : @xmath235 , in the limit @xmath236 .",
    "coming back to the time variable , the equation becomes : @xmath237 which is a sbm in the limit @xmath238 , _",
    "i.e. _ , with @xmath239 at large times . this result highlights the non - stationary nature of the process due to the very long - ranged memory , which gradually slows down the walker .",
    "this mapping is also interesting because it provides a concrete example of a random walk with constant parameters and constant time increment that can be described as a sbm asymptotically ( at least , as far as the probability function @xmath21 is concerned ) . here",
    ", the sbm time rescaling is not of the power - law form usually considered but is given by @xmath240 conversely , this type of sbm can be considered as a mean - field model for the path - dependent random walks studied here ( individual trajectories clearly differ in the two processes ) . as noted earlier , we emphasize that this correspondence is only valid at very large times . at moderate @xmath129 ( _ e.g. _ , for @xmath241 or any numerical simulation time in practice ) ,",
    "the memory model does not obeys simple scaling _ a priori_.",
    "the sbm analogy could be used to infer the first - passage properties of the model ( although they would be limited to the regime of extremely long times ) .",
    "in addition , the non - ergodic properties of sbm systems have been recently studied in details in @xcite , and could find an application here .",
    "non - markovian , path - dependent processes are in general difficult to analyze for a single particle , since a rigorous description usually requires the introduction of multiple - time distribution functions , that are related to each other via a hierarchy of master equations @xcite .    here we have introduced a path - dependent random walk model that does not exhibit such complications and can be described by the single - time distribution function .",
    "this property stems from the linear nature of the model , in which the walker can perform non - local steps backwards in time . with this form of self - attraction",
    ", the process can be exactly described by one master equation .",
    "additionally , the equation is solved exactly in the long time limit thanks to the scaling hypothesis .",
    "therefore , a rather precise picture of the dynamics is obtained , which is not limited to the derivation of the msd .    the model exhibit",
    "three regimes , depending on how fast memory decays . in the weakly non - markovian regime",
    ", diffusion is asymptotically normal but with a reduced diffusion coefficient .",
    "a transition to a second regime occurs if the mean memory time diverges , _",
    "i. e. _ when the memory kernel decays as @xmath242 with @xmath43 . in this case ,",
    "recurrence to previously visited sites increases sharply and motion becomes subdiffusive .",
    "when memory decays very slowly , slower than @xmath243 , a third , ultra - slow \" diffusion regime with logarithmic behavior settles .",
    "the diffusion front is a function which is practically unknown for reinforced walk models , and almost never studied for other non - markovian models which are solvable for the msd @xcite ( but see @xcite for a discussion on the so - called elephant walk ) .",
    "the knowledge of the scaling function here has allowed us to establish useful connections between a reinforced walk and well - known markovian models of anomalous diffusion : namely , the ctrw ( @xmath59 ) and the sbm ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the present model exhibits distinctive features , such as a new scaling function defined through eq .",
    "( [ momentbis ] ) , and anti - correlated lvy steps with exponent @xmath244 at the subdiffusive transition .",
    "the visitation and first - passage statistics are also likely to be peculiar in this model , and their study certainly deserves future work .",
    "our results also unveil a novel , memory driven mechanism for the emergence of lvy flights .",
    "whereas lvy flights are a paradigmatic model of superdiffusive behavior in physical @xcite and biological @xcite systems , the model exposed here illustrates that ( truncated ) lvy flights can be also closely linked to subdiffusion .",
    "this aspect is particularly relevant to the mobility of many living organisms like humans @xcite or non - human primates @xcite , to name a few , who often combine two apparently contradictory patterns : a power - law step length distribution and a very slow diffusion or limited space use .",
