    "the majority of core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) are associated with the deaths of hydrogen - rich massive stars with zero - age - main - sequence masses @xmath1 >  8  . the most common hydrogen - rich type ii sne exhibit a @xmath2 day plateau in their light curves ( sne  iip ) , and the physics behind their emission",
    "is well understood .",
    "in particular , the energy source powering the plateau phase is the energy deposited by the shock wave soon after the explosion .",
    "the recombination process of the ionized hydrogen is responsible for the photosphere moving inward and allowing the stored energy to be radiated during this phase @xcite .",
    "the recombination wave travels through the hydrogen - rich ejecta as the sn expands homologously and cools @xcite .",
    "however , a fraction of sne  ii have a linear decline in their light curves after a rapid rise to maximum light ( sne  iil ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "after either the plateau or linear decline phase in sne ii there is a subsequent rapid drop , usually around 100 - 140 days after explosion for sne iip and 80 - 100 days for sne iil @xcite . this difference may be due to a smaller ejecta mass in sne iil .",
    "@xcite argued that the fast light - curve decline of sne iil is the result of both the small amount ( 12 ) of hydrogen envelope in a progenitor of relatively larger radius ( a few 1000 ) .",
    "these values can be compared with the progenitors of sne iip , which are red supergiants ( rsgs ) that span radii of 101600 @xcite at the moment of explosion and should have an ejected mass of @xmath3 610 .",
    "recent hydrodynamical and radiative - transfer calculations have also confirmed that a smaller ejected mass may produce a short plateau , but can not reproduce the luminosity of sne  iil @xcite . a larger radius , a different hydrogen distribution , or extra energy sources may play an important role in shaping the light curves of sne  iil .",
    "rsgs have been definitively identified as the progenitors of sne  iip ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , with masses estimated from the measured luminosities of the progenitor stars to be in the range 817 .",
    "the fact that more - massive rsg progenitors have not been identified has been highlighted as significant and termed the `` red supergiant problem '' @xcite .",
    "the separation , if any , between sne  iip and iil is an open issue .",
    "some authors suggest that they form a continuous distribution @xcite , while others favour their separation into distinct classes @xcite .",
    "if one of the keys to differentiating sne  iip from iil is the amount of hydrogen in the envelope , a clear dichotomy may suggest the presence of a specific , unknown ingredient in the evolution of massive stars that sometimes strips them of discrete ( large for sne  iil , small for sne  iip ) amounts of hydrogen . despite an increasing number of sne  ii with published light curves and the growing evidence that sne  ii form a continuum of light - curve properties , it remains unknown whether their progenitors span a range of stellar populations .    in this paper",
    ", we present comprehensive optical light curves of 12 sne  ii that have been monitored by the las cumbras observatory global telescope ( lcogt , @xcite ) network between 2013 and 2014 .",
    "the lcogt network of nine 1  m and two 2  m robotic telescopes enables photometric coverage with long temporal baselines and fast response times to cover the most time - critical phases of sn evolution .",
    "many of these sne  ii have also been followed at ultraviolet ( uv ) wavelengths with the uvot camera onboard _ swift",
    "when possible , we will compare our data with those previously published and publicly available ( see next section ) .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to focus on generic properties of our sample to gain an expanded understanding of the sn  iip / iil diversity .",
    "various authors use different values of the linear decay rate after maximum brightness to separate sne iip and sne iil .",
    "_ the reader should be aware that in this paper , we will not define a specific decline - rate value to distinguish sne  iip and sne  iil ; rather , we will use iip to refer to sne  ii with flatter linear decays after maximum light ( iip - like sne ) and iil to refer to sne  ii with faster decline rates after maximum light ( iil - like sne ) .",
    "_ when possible , we will colour - code the sample of objects using the decline rate of the @xmath4-band light curve ( @xmath5 ; see section [ sec : slope ] for the definition ) to emphasize that we are not dividing sne  ii to iip and iil _ a priori_.    in section  [ sec : sample ] , we present our sample of new sne as well as sne from the literature that are used in the analysis . in section  [ sec : data ] we present our photometric data , and section [ sec : slope ] describes the main parameters characterizing them ( listed also in the appendix [ apefigures ] ) .",
    "we repeat the analysis in section  [ sec : bolo ] using pseudobolometric light curves . in section  [ sec : early ] we discuss early - time data , focusing on the uv differences between sne  iip and iil .",
    "we derive in section  [ sec : nickel ] the amount of @xmath0ni produced in sne  ii and compare our results with progenitor studies of sne  ii @xcite . in section  [ sec : nebular ]",
    "we constrain the mass of the progenitor for a few sne in our sample using their nebular spectra , and section [ sec : discussion ] summarizes our results .",
