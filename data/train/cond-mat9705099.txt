    "with the discovery of the first inorganic spin - peierls compound cugeo@xmath0 @xcite it has become possible to investigate the physics of the spin - peierls transition in quasi one - dimensional spin chains with high precision . of particular interest has been the study of the magnetic excitation spectrum by neutron scattering @xcite and raman scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "it has been observed @xcite , that the spin - peierls gap , i.e.  the gap to triplet excitations out of the singlet ground - state , has a temperature dependence which is difficult to explain with existing theories of the spin - peierls transition @xcite .",
    "existing theories of the spin - peierls transition of spin-1/2 heisenberg chains are based on the mapping of the spin chain to an interacting gas of spin - less fermions via the jordan - wigner transformation @xcite .",
    "the chains are coupled to a three - dimensional phonon mode and the transition occurs when the respective phonon frequency becomes soft . in the spin - peierls state",
    "the unit - cell doubles due to the alternating displacements of the magnetic ions .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for the magnetic excitations along the chains in the dimerized state is then @xcite    @xmath2 . \\label{h}\\ ] ]    the nearest neighbor ( nn ) exchange has alternating strength @xmath3 due to the doubling of the unit cell below the spin - peierls transition temperature @xmath4 .",
    "also included in ( [ h ] ) is a frustrating next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) term @xmath5 .",
    "the ground - state phase diagram of ( [ h ] ) has been mapped out by a density matrix renormalization group study @xcite .",
    "there is a gap everywhere in the phase - diagram except on the line @xmath6 and @xmath7 , with @xmath8 .",
    "a vividly debated question of key interest is therefore the actual magnitude of the strength of the frustration @xmath9 .",
    "for cugeo@xmath0 the parameters have been estimated as @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "a consequence of existing theories of the spin - peierls transition is the occurrence of a soft phonon mode above @xmath4 , which has not yet been observed for cugeo@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of interest to pursue the possibility of a purely electronically driven spin - peierls transition , as it could occur for @xmath12 .",
    "in such a scenario the phonons would just follow the pre - formed electronic dimerization , i.e.  the formation of nn singlet pairs . here",
    "we propose a simple molecular - field type theory for the spin - peierls transition by mapping the low - energy solitonic excitations of dimerized spin chains on an effective ising model .",
    "we emphasize that this procedure is valid both for the phonon - driven and for the electronically - driven spin - peierls transition .",
    "we present results of the mean - field theory in comparison with experiments on cugeo@xmath0 .",
    "we find that a straightforward determination of the frustration parameter @xmath13 is not conclusive and that cugeo@xmath0 is close to a first - order phase transition .",
    "we also note that the famous @xmath14 scaling of the triplet gap @xcite is a simple consequence of the linear binding potential between solitons and anti - solitons in dimerized spin chains .",
    "a strictly one - dimensional system shows no long - range order at finite temperatures due to the solitonic excitations .",
    "the appropriate solitons in a spin - peierls state are domain - walls in between two different dimer coverings , see fig .",
    "[ dimerchain ] . in this picture",
    "a dimer consists of a nn pair of spins in singlet state . a single soliton in an otherwise ( dimer- ) ordered chain is in reality a complicated object @xcite .",
    "it is spatially extended @xcite and has a spin degree of freedom together with a dispersion , which in the majumdar - gosh model ( @xmath15 @xcite ) has the form @xmath16 .",
    "it has been shown @xcite , that the solitons yield an accurate description of the magnetic susceptibility and hence of the hilbert space .",
    "the dispersion of the solitons might be approximated , in general , by    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the gap to solitonic excitations , @xmath19 the exchange integral , @xmath20 a constant of order of unity , and @xmath21 is the wavenumber in units of inverse lattice spacings .",
    "only the low - energy solitons are effective in destroying the long - range dimer order , and we approximate here ( [ dispersion ] ) by a constant @xmath22 .",
    "we will furthermore not discuss the consequence of the spatial extent of the solitons and we will include their spin - degree of freedom only when determining the susceptibility .",
    "we take one of the two possible dimer configurations of the linear chain as the reference state and label every `` good '' dimer by @xmath23 and every bond between two `` wrong '' dimers by @xmath24 ; a bond between a soliton and a wrong dimer is also labeled @xmath24 as shown in fig .  [ dimerchain ] .",
    "every possible soliton configuration is therefore mapped to a ising - spin configuration living on every second bond . a similar mapping has been used recently by mostovoy and khomskii @xcite .",
    "= 0.48    we now consider a two - dimensional array of chains and define by @xmath25 the ising variable on the @xmath26 chain , where the site index @xmath27 runs over every second bond of a chain of length @xmath28 .",
    "including a coupling @xmath29 between dimers on nn chains we have    @xmath30    as the effective ising hamiltonian .",
    "the inter - chain coupling @xmath29 might be induced by the inter - chain exchange coupling , @xmath31 . in this case",
    ". an indirect coupling of the chains via phonons is also conceivable @xcite .",
    "it has been shown recently , that a molecular - field decoupling of inter - chain interactions in quasi one - dimensional systems is a good approximation in the strongly anisotropic limit @xcite .",
    "we may therefore decouple the chains via    @xmath33    where the @xmath34 denotes the thermodynamic expectation value .",
    "translational invariance perpendicular to the chains yields @xmath35 and the hamiltonian for a single chain ( the number of ising variables is @xmath36 ) becomes in this mean - field approximation    @xmath37    where we have set @xmath38 .",
    "this is just the ising hamiltonian for a ferromagnetic spin chain in an external magnetic field @xmath39 .",
    "alternatively we can interpret ( [ ising ] ) as an effective model for domain walls in a spin - peierls state with a linear binding potential @xmath40 ( with @xmath41 being the distance in sites , not bonds ) between a soliton and an anti - soliton .",
    "so far we have neglected the spin - phonon coupling @xmath42 .",
    "a finite value for the spin - singlet order parameter @xmath43 leads through @xmath44 to a finite lattice dimerization and consequently to a modulation of the exchange constant , @xmath45 , in ( [ h ] ) , with @xmath46 .",
    "the spin - phonon coupling therefore adds a term @xmath47 to the confining potential @xmath39 . on a mean - field level",
    "this corresponds to a rescaling of the coupling constant    @xmath48    with appropriate constants @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the partition function @xmath51 can be obtained from ( [ ising ] ) by the transfer matrix method . the free energy @xmath52 is given in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath53 ) by    @xmath54    where @xmath55 with @xmath56 being the inverse temperature . from the free energy all physical quantities can be derived .",
    "we have two relevant excitation energies , the gap to single soliton excitations , given by @xmath18 in ( [ ising ] ) , and the gap to triplet excitations , @xmath57 , as measured in a neutron scattering experiment @xcite .",
    "let us now discuss the relation of @xmath58 to @xmath59 .",
    "a triplet excitation can dissolve into a soliton / anti - soliton pair .",
    "the linear binding energy @xmath40 in between a soliton and an anti - soliton in ( [ ising ] ) leads to a confinement of soliton / anti - soliton pairs @xcite . in ( [ ising ] )",
    "we have neglected the kinetic energy of the single solitons ( [ dispersion ] ) , which is of order @xmath60 . the energy levels of a particle in a linear confining potential are well known @xcite .",
    "the lowest eigenstate has , in the limit @xmath61 , the energy    @xmath62    with @xmath63 .",
    "( [ delta_n ] ) gives then the gap to triplet excitations as a function of soliton energy @xmath18 and the strength of the confining potential @xmath39 .",
    "the mean extension of a soliton / anti - soliton pair scales like @xmath64 .",
    "for @xmath65 we have @xmath66 and eq .",
    "( [ delta_n ] ) takes then the form    @xmath67    where @xmath68 is the @xmath69-dependent spin - wave velocity @xcite .",
    "it is known @xcite , that the gap scales for @xmath65 like @xmath14 implying that @xmath70 for @xmath71 .",
    "comparison with numerical results @xcite leads to @xmath72 .",
    "the functional form of the dependence of the soliton excitation energy @xmath18 on @xmath73 , or alternatively on the dimerization order parameter @xmath43 is not known at present .",
    "it might be extracted for @xmath7 , in principle , from a sub - leading scaling analysis of the excitation energy    @xmath74    but this has not yet been done .",
    "we have therefore decided to assume the functional form    @xmath75    where @xmath76 is the zero - temperature value of @xmath18 and where @xmath77 is the soliton energy in the disordered phase , i.e.  for @xmath78 .",
    "( [ e_s ] ) is , in the spirit of a landau functional ( [ landau ] ) , the simplest form consistent with the symmetry of @xmath79 .",
    "we may expand the free energy ( [ free ] ) in powers of @xmath79 ,    @xmath80    depending on the parameters we may have either a second - order phase transition with @xmath81 or a first - order phase transition with @xmath82 . in the first case the transition temperature @xmath83 is given by @xmath84 as    @xmath85    with @xmath86 .",

    "this is the case for values of @xmath76 larger than a certain critical value of the soliton energy @xmath90 , which is determined from @xmath91 as    @xmath92    for a fixed transition temperature @xmath93 and using eq .",
