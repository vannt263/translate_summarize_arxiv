    "only 50% of the baryons consistent with the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) and big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) observations have been detected observationally @xcite ; the validation of the standard cosmological model relies on our ability to detect the missing baryons observationally @xcite . using data from the canada france hawaii lensing survey and the planck satellite , recent studies , that use cross - correlation of the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich ( tsz ) effect and weak gravitational lensing ,",
    "have shown that up to @xmath7 of the baryons may reside outside the virial radius of the halos @xcite .",
    "the cosmological simulations too suggest that majority of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) are in the form of warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) within a temperature range @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "it is also believed that whims reside in moderately overdense structure such as filaments . however , being collisionally ionized these baryons do not leave any footprints in lyman-@xmath9 absorption systems .",
    "the emission from whims in either uv photons or x - rays is too weak to be detected given the sensitivity of current instruments .",
    "their detection is also not feasible in x - ray given the low level of emission from whim .",
    "however the baryons in the cosmic web have sufficient velocity and column density to produce a detectable cmb secondary anisotropy effect known as the kinetic sunyaev - zeldovich ( ksz ) effect @xcite .",
    "cmb secondary anisotropies arise at all angular scales ; the largest secondary anisotropy at the arcminute scale is due to the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich ( tsz ) effect .",
    "the tsz effect is caused by the thermal motion of electrons mainly from hot ionized gas in galaxy clusters where as the _ kinetic _ sunyaev - zeldovich ( ksz ) effect is attributed to the bulk motion of electrons in an ionized medium @xcite .",
    "the tsz can be separated from cmb maps using spectral information . along with lensing of cmb ,",
    "the ksz is the most dominant secondary contribution at arcminute scale after the removal of tsz , as primary cmb is sub - dominant due to the silk - damping @xcite .",
    "the _ thermal _ and _ kinetic _ sunyaev - zeldovich effects ( tsz and ksz respectively ) are both promising probes of the ionized fractions of the baryons .",
    "majority of tsz effect is caused by electrons in virialized collapsed objects @xcite .",
    "the overdensity in these regions is considerably high , @xmath10 .",
    "the missing baryons however are more likely to reside in filaments with moderate overdensity and lower temperature and hence unlikely to be probed efficiently by tsz .",
    "interestingly , the ksz is linked to the peculiar velocity which is sensitive to large scale potential and less likely to be sensitive to individual collapsed objects .",
    "it is also less sensitive to the thermal state and can probe contributions from individual baryonic components in a relatively unbiased way @xcite . for previous studies of ksz effect from whims",
    "see e.g. @xcite . the methods for extracting the ksz which we present here are free from systematics that one might encounter when trying to detect it using the cmb two - point auto correlation function or equivalently the power - spectral analysis .",
    "the ksz signal is not only extremely weak ; it also lacks any spectral feature @xcite and is overwhelmed by the primary cmb below @xmath11 .",
    "the ksz effect dominate at the damping tail of the primary beyond @xmath12 only at @xmath13  ghz where the dominant _ secondary _ contribution from the non - relativistic tsz effect vanishes .",
    "contamination from dusty star forming galaxies can also further complicate detection of ksz effect @xcite .",
    "use of non - gaussianity has been suggested as possible method to separate ksz from confusion due to lensing of cmb @xcite .",
    "being a cmb secondary anisotropy , the ksz effect includes projected contributions from various independent components and lacks any redshift information .",
    "it is a projection of electron momentum along the line of sight .",
    "lack of redshift information means it is impossible to separate individual contribution such as from a _ patchy _ reionization history , which is expected to contribute significantly and thus can in principle bias any estimates of missing baryons .",
    "the tight cross - correlation of tsz and galaxy densities has been probed in the literature in detail @xcite .",
    "however such a cross - correlation vanishes due to the vectorial ( spin-1 ) nature of the ksz . to circumvent this problem various options have currently been tried , e.g. using higher order cumulant correlators @xcite or tomographic cross - correlation with galaxy redshift surveys @xcite .",
    "cross - correlation with other tracers of low redshift large scale structure e.g. intensity mapping from future 21 cm surveys has also been considered @xcite .    the recently proposed technique dubbed ksz _ tomography _",
    "@xcite , involves reconstructing the galaxy peculiar velocity field from spectroscopic redshift surveys and including galaxy number density and other redshift dependent pre - factors .",
    "notice that bulk flows on scales of @xmath14 and the pairwise velocity dispersion have been observed @xcite .",
    "the reconstructed momentum field has very similar directional dependence as the true ksz effect .",
    "thus the cross - correlation of these two can be used as an indicator for the ksz contribution to cmb maps . with redshift space binning it is also possible to study evolution of ksz contribution as a function of redshift .",
    "this method can be useful in separating out not only the primary cmb from ksz but also various contribution such as the contribution from patchy reionization .",
    "a high value for the signal to noise @xmath15 was estimated using planck and the bigboss survey .",
    "notice that similar tomographic reconstruction was also proposed for tsz @xcite as was recently extended to 3d recently @xcite .    in recent years",
    "there has been significant progress in extracting survey information using three - dimensional spherical fourier - bessel ( sfb ) decomposition of galaxy surveys which goes beyond a tomographic treatment @xcite .",
    "the formalism involves expanding the galaxy density field in a sfb expansion .",
    "the formalism was found extremely useful in analysing weak lensing data in 3d @xcite . going beyond the tomographic cross - correlation in this paper we use a 3d treatment to reconstruct the ksz from galaxy surveys .",
    "this is in line with the reconstruction technique developed for tsz by @xcite using a 3d sfb decomposition .",
    "spectroscopic galaxy redshift surveys , such as lamost , boss , bigboss , ska , euclid and jdem / adept will map the galaxy distribution in 3d .",
    "these surveys will have overlap in terms of observed regions of the sky with ongoing cmb surveys , e.g. , act , spt and planck .",
    "it is possible to recover the velocity fields from such surveys and construct an estimator in 3d that can be correlated with cmb maps to reconstruct the distribution of ionized gas whose bulk velocity is causing the ksz .    the primary aim of this paper is to disentangle the low - redshift ( late - time ) contribution to ksz effect and that from a rather poorly understood reionization history .",
    "this will allow us to to use future ksz surveys in constraining the interaction of dark energy ( de ) and dark matter ( dm ) using the ksz effect as such a non - gravitational coupling in the dark sector can significantly affect the expansion history of the universe as well as growth of structure @xcite .",
    "indeed various modified gravity theories that affect the growth rate and power spectrum of perturbation can also be constrained using ksz effect .",
    "the results presented here will be relevant to extending studies of ksz in constarining radial inhomegeneites in lemaitre - tolman bondi cosmologies @xcite or dark flow @xcite .",
    "the current upper limit on the ksz power spectrum from the atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) is @xmath16 at @xmath17 .",
    "the upper limits from the south pole telescope ( spt ) is @xmath18 at @xmath17 .",
    "most recently @xcite reported @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "these upper limits depend on the reionization history , modelling of cosmic infra - red background , tsz contribution and separation of the ksz effect into homogeneous and patchy components . using arcminute resolution maps from act and boss statistical evidence was presented for motion of galaxy clusters through their ksz signature @xcite .",
    "the foreground - cleaned maps from planck nominal mission data were used to achieve a @xmath21 detections of the ksz signal .",
    "this was achieved by estimating the pairwise momentum of the ksz temperature fluctuations at the positions of the cgc ( central galaxy catalogue ) samples extracted from sloan digital sky survey ( dr7 ) data @xcite . in the same study ,",
    "data from wmap i.e. wmap-9yr w band data a detection of @xmath22 was also reported .",
    "the best constraints on reionization history are likely to result from redshifted 21-cm experiments with low - frequency radio interferometers gmrt@xcite , lofar@xcite , mwa@xcite and paper@xcite",
    ". the near infra - red background measurements with ciber and akari will also provide valuable clues to reionization history .",
    "in addition , ground - based observations of high - redshift qso , galaxies and grbs too provide important clues to reionization history @xcite .",

    "the particular cosmology that we will adopt for numerical study is specified by the following parameter values ( to be introduced later ) : @xmath45 .",
    "the cosmic ionized transverse momentum can be studied as a temperature fluctuation in the cmb maps .",
    "the line - of - sight ( los ) component of the momentum of electrons in the ionized igm introduces temperature fluctuation via the doppler effect also known as ksz .",
    "the contribution from the longitudinal component suffers cancellation due to contribution from successive troughs and crests @xcite .",
    "the measured ksz power spectrum is the sum over contribution from the epoch of reionization ( eor ) and the post - reionization or late - time ksz contribution .",

    "our reconstruction technique is based on local large scale tracers which typically cover the redshift range @xmath61 which justifies our choice of @xmath56 .",
    "modelling of the post - reionization signal is simpler because the igm is fully ionized and @xmath48 does not fluctuate to a good approximation : @xmath62 .",
