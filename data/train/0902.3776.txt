    "considering semigroups from the combinatorial and geometric point of view is an active research field in recent years .",
    "a major theme in this line of thinking is the transfer of ideas from combinatorial and geometric group theory into the language of semigroup theory .",
    "for example , the definitions of hyperbolic groups and automatic groups were extended to semigroups ; see @xcite .",
    "one source of difficulty comes from the structure of the ( right ) cayley graph of the semigroup . in groups",
    "the cayley graph is a homogeneous space and enjoys a natural metric which is known as the word metric . in semigroups",
    "this is no longer true ; the cayley graph is not homogeneous and it is not clear how to define a useful metric on it .",
    "we will therefore focus on the case where the semigroup is embeddable . in this case , one may use the metric induced from an embedding of a semigroup cayley graph into a group cayley graph .",
    "however , as we shall see , this alone does nt allow transfer of results from groups to semigroups .    in @xcite",
    "the idea of van kampen diagrams is extended to the case of monoids and semigroups .",
    "the author there uses small - overlap conditions to solve the word problem and to prove adjan s criterion for embeddability . in groups ,",
    "small - cancellation conditions imply automaticity @xcite and certainly hyperbolicity implies automaticity . in this work we will consider hyperbolic - like small - overlap conditions that imply automaticity ( but also embeddablity into a group )",
    ". this will give a partial answer to a question asked in @xcite .",
    "before we can state the main theorem we need some terminology .",
    "let @xmath0 be a semigroup presentation .",
    "the set of relations in @xmath1 is called the _ defining relations _ ; the set of words appearing in the defining relations is called the _ defining words _ and we denote it by @xmath2 .",
    "a piece for @xmath1 is a word @xmath3 such that there are two defining words @xmath4 and @xmath5 which decompose as @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , and either @xmath8 or @xmath9 . for a word @xmath10 we denote by @xmath11 the _ piece - length _ of @xmath12 , namely , the minimal @xmath13 such that @xmath14 and @xmath15 are pieces ( it is zero if @xmath12 is the empty word and it is @xmath16 if no such decomposition exists ) . let @xmath0 be a semigroup presentation .",
    "we say that @xmath1 is a @xmath17 presentation @xcite if the following conditions hold :    1 .",
    "each defining relation @xmath18 has the property that @xmath19 and @xmath20 both start ( respectively , end ) with different generators . 2 .",
    "each defining word @xmath12 has a piece - length of at least @xmath21 ( i.e. , @xmath22 ) .",
    "3 .   if @xmath23 and @xmath24 are two defining relations then all four words",
    "@xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath27 are distinct .    condition @xmath17 implies @xcite that the semigroup presented by @xmath1 is embeddable .",
    "our main theorem is the following :    [ thm : mainthm ] let @xmath0 be a semigroup presentation .",
    "assume that the @xmath17 condition holds and also :    1 .",
    "each defining relation @xmath18 has the property that @xmath28 .",
    "then , the semigroup presented by @xmath1 is automatic .",
    "recently , and independently , mark kambites @xcite has shown that semigroups for which each defining word has a piece - length at least four , also known as @xmath29 semigroups , are asynchronously - automatic .",
    "this is a weaker notion than automaticity .",
    "however , the @xmath29 small - overlap assumption is weaker than the assumptions in the main theorem since it does not imply that the semigroup is embeddable .",
    "the following is a natural question :    can one show that the @xmath29 small - overlap condition implies that the semigroup is automatic ? ( or find a counter example . )",
    "@xmath30 groups ( in which each relator decomposes to at least seven pieces ) are hyperbolic .",
    "now , in hyperbolic groups one may construct an automatic structure by considering the set of geodesics .",
    "we give an example ( section [ sec : example ] ) showing that even in our restricted setup one can not use the set of geodesics as an automatic structure .",
    "automatic semigroups ( or monoids ) are defined using language theoretic notions ( see definition [ def : autosg ] ) .",
    "there are ` geometric characterizations ' @xcite which are not as simple ( or nice ) as in the group case .",
    "we show , however , that for embeddable semigroups one can use the geometric characterization ( known as fellow - traveller property ) .",
    "this can be done by considering the metric on the cayley graph which is induced from the embedding of the semigroup .    for semigroups ,",
    "the conjugacy problem is the problem of deciding if for two elements @xmath31 and @xmath32 there are other elements @xmath33 and @xmath12 such that @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( equality of elements in the semigroup ) . for bi - automatic groups",
    "this problem is decidable ( * ? ? ?",
    ". a straightforward generalization of the proof of the main theorem shows that in fact the semigroups considered in the main theorem are _ bi - automatic _",
    "( this is done in @xcite ) .",
    "thus , using the same proof as the one in @xcite we get that the conjugacy problem for these semigroups is decidable .",
    "note however that the complexity of the solution is doubly exponential .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "sec : preliminaries ] we give the basic definition and notations . in section [ sec : autoinsemigrp ] we give the characterization of automaticity for embeddable semigroups and we show how to prove automaticity using a special order on the elements of the semigroup . in section [ sec : example ] we give an example of an embeddable semigroup for which the conditions of the main theorem hold but the set of geodesics is not an automatic structure . in section [ sec : vankampen ] we recall the parts of van kampen diagram theory we need for the proof .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : proofmainthm ] we prove the main theorem .",

    "we denote the length of @xmath12 by @xmath48 .",
    "we say that @xmath33 is a _ subword _ of @xmath12 if @xmath12 has a decomposition @xmath49 ; @xmath33 is a _ prefix _ of @xmath12 if @xmath50 and it is a _ suffix _ of @xmath12 if @xmath51 .",
    "if @xmath12 and @xmath52 in @xmath40 present the same element in @xmath36 ( i.e. , @xmath53 ) than we may emphasis that the equality is in @xmath36 by writing @xmath54 . if @xmath36 and @xmath37 are understood from the context we may also simply write @xmath47 instead of @xmath55 .",
