    "the realization of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of trapped atomic gases @xcite has generated in the last years a huge amount of experimental and theoretical research @xcite .",
    "bec was achieved by confining atoms in magnetic traps and lowering the temperature of the system via the evaporative cooling technique . in this technique ,",
    "the hottest atoms are selectively removed from the system and the remaining ones rethermalize via two - body collisions .",
    "a common feature of these experiments is that the trapped gases are dilute ; mean - field theory then provides a useful framework to study the role of the interaction between particles .",
    "recently , a new feature has been added to the experiments : the magnetically trapped condensate is transferred into an optical lattice generated by interfering laser beams @xcite . with this new experimental setup",
    "it is possible to access the strongly correlated regime .",
    "the superfluid - mott - insulator transition was studied @xcite and other interesting physical phenomena such as the collapse and revival of the condensate have been found @xcite .",
    "the presence of the optical lattice and the fact that the particles interact only via contact interaction lead in a natural way to the hubbard model as a paradigm for these systems . a theoretical work proposing such experiments @xcite and recent quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations",
    "@xcite have investigated these systems beyond the mean - field approximation .",
    "it has been found that the incompressible mott - insulating phase always coexists with compressible phases so that a local order parameter @xcite has to be defined to characterize the system .",
    "also , the phase diagram of trapped bosons was found to be more complex than the one in the homogeneous system @xcite .",
    "the experimental realization of ultracold fermionic gases is more difficult than the bosonic case , and has been achieved only recently @xcite . unlike bosons , single species fermions can not be directly evaporatively cooled to very low temperatures because the s - wave scattering that could allow the gas to rethermalize during the evaporation is prohibited for identical fermions .",
    "this problem has been overcome by simultaneously trapping and evaporatively cooling two - component fermi gases @xcite , and introducing mixed gases of bosons and fermions in which bosons enable fermions to rethermalize through their elastic interactions @xcite .",
    "more recently , rapid forced evaporation employing a feshbach resonance of two different spin states of the same fermionic atom has been used @xcite . now that it is possible to go well below the degeneracy temperature in the experiments and superfluidity appears within reach @xcite",
    ", it is expected that the metal - mott - insulator transition ( mmit ) could also be realized for fermions on an optical lattice .    motivated by this expectation we study the ground state of the one - dimensional ( 1d ) fermionic hubbard model with a harmonic trap and with repulsive contact interaction , using qmc simulations .",
    "like in the bosonic case @xcite , mott - insulating domains appear over a continuous range of fillings and always coexist with compressible phases , such that global quantities are not appropriate to characterize the system . instead",
    ", we define a local - order parameter ( a local compressibility ) in order to characterize the local phases present in the system .",
    "we also analyze the generic features that are valid for any kind of confining potential , and not only for the harmonic one .",
    "it is well known that the hubbard model in the periodic case displays a mmit phase transition at half filling and at a finite value of the on - site repulsive interaction @xmath0 .",
    "( in the case of perfect nesting the transition occurs at @xmath1 . )",
    "the two routes to this mmit are the filling - controlled mmit and the bandwidth - controlled mmit @xcite . in the confined case ,",
    "it is possible to drive the transitions by changing the total filling of the trap , the on - site repulsive interaction , or varying the curvature of the confining potential . in the following section , we study a number of local quantities as a function of the filling and the strength of the interaction .",
    "although they signal the appearance of a mott - insulating phase , such quantities provide no rigorous criterion to characterize the mott - insulating region .",
