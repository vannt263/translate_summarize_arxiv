    "414 rotating stars had acceptable photometric and parallax uncertainties in tgas , but were culled from this sample for having @xmath9 luminosities higher than the main sequence cut in  3 above .",
    "note that distributions of @xmath12 values from the kepler input catalog @xcite for both the main sequence and subgiant stars were not statistically different .",
    "the minimum in the bimodal period distribution in figure [ fig : gyro ] can be traced using a gyrochonology isochrone ( colloquially known as a `` gyrochrone '' ) .",
    "many different studies have produced competing gyrochrone models , each with unique morphologies at the hot and cool star regimes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "a 600 myr gyrochrone from @xcite , converted from @xmath13 color to temperature using the the transformation from @xcite , was determined by eye to approximately trace the period minima from 3500 k to 6000 k. as shown in figure [ fig : gyro ] , this model ( as with most gyrochronology models ) turns down in period sharply for stars hotter than @xmath16000 k. a log - linear extrapolation of the 600 myr gyrochrone at 6000 k continues to trace the period bimodality up to 6500 k , and roughly traces a line of constant rossby number assuming a local convective turnover timescale such as from @xcite .     the bimodal rotation period distribution is clear , with peaks at @xmath14 of -0.19 and 0.21 from a two - gaussian model fit ( blue line )",

    "a two gaussian model was fit to this data , which found peaks in the two distributions of @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",

    "this explanation was bolstered by their observation that stars in the two period groups have differing distributions of proper motions , indicating they belonged to kinematically separate groups .",
    "this measurement is replicated in figure [ fig : pm ] , which shows the total proper motion distribution for stars above and below the 600 myr gyrochrone .",
    "stars above the gyrochrone ( slower rotators , nominally older ) have a median total proper motion of 15.4 mas / yr , while those below ( faster rotators , younger ) have a median of 11.3 mas / yr . this difference in kinematics versus rotation period is in the same direction observed by @xcite .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov statistic for these two samples is 0.14 , which does not rule out the null hypothesis that they are drawn from the same distribution . the slower rotating sample ( black in figure [ fig : pm ] ) appears to have a bimodal distribution in proper motion , indicating possibly significant contamination from a younger , lower proper motion population that is consistent with the rapidly rotating stars .",
    "further investigation of rotation and kinematics of nearby stars using larger samples from future gaia data releases is needed .",
    "using a combination of data from _",
    "kepler_and gaia dr1 , i have explored the rotation period distribution for 440 nearby main sequence stars .",
    "a bimodal rotation period distribution has been found in stars with temperatures ranging from 5000 k to 6500 k. this feature matches that found in cooler stars from _ kepler _ , but was only revealed thanks to the enhanced ability to distinguish dwarfs from subgiants using gaia data . a tenuous difference in the tgas total proper motion for stars in the fast and slow rotating groups",
    "is found , which is in agreement with the findings for cool stars by @xcite .",
    "while a definitive explanation for this period bimodality has not been reached , the findings to date seem to favor stellar ages as the cause . in this scenario",
    "the star formation history for nearby stars would be dominated by two epochs of star formation , one short event centered at a few hundred myr , and one long event centered at a few gyr ( slightly younger than the sun ) .",
    "it is also worth noting that the space volume probed by the tgas sample investigated here is very similar to that covered by the temperature - selected cool star sample in @xcite .",
    "the median parallax distance for stars in this work is 285 pc , while the median isochrone distance for the k and m dwarfs is @xmath1216 pc .",
    "this points to the period distribution being a localized age artifact .",
    "determining how localized this age distribution is , and if it can be confirmed for stars across the hr diagram including giants , is a key goal for future gaia data releases .",
    "the period bimodality may yet be a manifestation of the `` vaughan - preston '' gap observed in chromospheric activity indicators from solar type stars .",
    "such a feature has also been discussed for rotating stars by @xcite . given that the mass range for the bimodality explored here and in @xcite covers stars with solar - type dynamos ( those having a tachocline , late f through early m )",
    "such a model can not be fully ruled out at this time . though there have been many rotation studies for cool stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) too few rotation periods have been measured for stars across the `` fully convective boundary '' ( @xmath17 k , spectral type @xmath1m4 ) to tell if the bimodal period feature continues to cooler temperatures , which would support the age distribution model .",
    "if the bimodality is due to stars crossing a phase of rapid angular momentum evolution , we would expect to see it in stellar clusters at or near the critical age",
    ". the lack of this feature in the clusters observed to date could be due to no cluster being close enough to the critical age , which the gyrochrone in figure [ fig : gyro ] shows is near 600 myr .",
    "further studies of rotation periods for stars in intermediate age open clusters ( e.g. the hyades ) may help solve this mystery ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "finally , this exploratory work has highlighted the utility of using astrometric data from gaia combined with detailed light curve statistics from _",
    "kepler_to reveal hidden substructure in the properties of field stars .",
    "looking forward to the astrometric precision of future gaia data releases , this combination will be effective at separating dwarf stars from subgiants for nearly the entire _",
