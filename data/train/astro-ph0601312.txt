    "the interstellar medium is not dense enough to attenuate gamma rays , so that radioactive decays can be observed throughout our galaxy .",
    "recent reviews on implications of gamma - ray observations for nucleosynthesis in our galaxy can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the nucleosynthesis results presented in the following have all been obtained from observations with the two main instruments on board the integral observatory : the spectrometer spi and the imager ibis ( for details regarding the instruments , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these two instruments are complementary in their characteristics , providing an unprecedented view of the universe at hard x - ray and soft gamma - ray energies .",

    "both figures were adapted from @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    the @xmath2ti yield of ccsne is notoriously difficult to calculate because it depends sensitively on the so - called mass cut , the explosion energy , and the ( a)symmetry of the explosion .",
    "the mass cut , which has not yet been successfully calculated and is illustrated in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ prantzos_44tifig ] , is the notional surface separating material that is ejected from material that will fall back onto the compact remnant ( neutron star or black hole ) of the explosion .",
    "@xmath2ti is believed to be produced in the deepest layers of the exploding star that may be ejected , depending on the precise location of the mass cut .",
    "the amount of synthesized @xmath2ti also depends sensitively on the explosion energy and ( a)symmetry .",
    "theoretical calculations indicate that both increased explosion energy and increased asymmetry result in an increased @xmath2ti yield .",

    "the astrophysical interest in @xmath2ti is two - fold . clearly , the amount and the velocity of @xmath2ti is a very powerful probe of the explosion mechanism and dynamics of ccsne , which are still poorly understood .",
    "in addition , the @xmath2ti gamma - ray line emission is an ideal indicator of young sn remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "the lifetime is about 90  y , which roughly coincides with the expected recurrence time interval for ccsne in our galaxy .",
    "it is therefore expected that with a sufficiently sensitive instrument a few young snrs should be visible in our galaxy at the current epoch .",
    "the most sensitive search to date for young snrs at gamma - ray energies was performed by @xcite who used the first year of integral observations to search for 68  kev and 78  kev line emission in the inner galaxy with the imager ibis .",
    "this search addresses a long - standing puzzle linking the galactic sn rate and galactic chemical evolution : given current estimates of the present - day rates of thermonuclear and ccsne and their yields , these events can only account for about @xmath10 of the solar @xmath2ca abundance based on chemical evolution models and assuming that all @xmath2ca is formed as @xmath2ti ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* leising & share 1994 ) ) .",
    "at the same time , given these sn properties , combined with models for their galactic distribution , past missions should have detected a few young snrs even with their lower sensitivities  and detections were certainly expected for the unprecedented limiting point source sensitivity achieved with ibis . however , as was the case in less sensitive previous searches , none have been found . to assess the implications of the non - detection of young snrs , @xcite estimated the probability that at least one @xmath2ti point source is detectable by generating monte carlo distributions using current estimates of the rates of thermonuclear and ccsne , of their yields , and of their galactic distribution ; sn explosions were simulated as a function of the recurrence time and the @xmath2ti yield of type  ii sne .",
    "a typical result is depicted in fig .",
    "[ renaud_fig ] .",
    "the monte carlo study rules out two obvious solutions to the @xmath2ca puzzle .",
    "the estimated galactic @xmath2ti production rate of ccsne could in principle be increased by postulating that the galactic sn rate has been underestimated , or by postulating that the @xmath2ti yields have been underestimated .",
    "neither solution is viable , because in order to account for the solar @xmath2ca abundance by sne a present - day production rate of @xmath11  m@xmath6  century@xmath12 is required  which is excluded at a greater than 95% confidence level for any acceptable combination of sn rates and @xmath2ti yields .",
    "a third solution , compatible with existing data , is the existence of another , rare but high yield , galactic @xmath2ti source such as sub - chandrasekhar mass white dwarf type  ia sne .",
    "the latest search for young snrs with ibis therefore highlights important open questions concerning the chemical evolution of our galaxy , the production of @xmath2ti in sne , and the galactic sn rate ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "astrophysically , the subtle differences in the production zones of the radioisotopes @xmath0al and @xmath1fe render their combined study an important probe of massive star nucleosynthesis .",
    "furthermore , since the lifetimes of these two radioisotopes are much shorter than galactic evolution timescales but are large enough to accumulate in the ism , @xmath0al and @xmath1fe are ideally suited to study the sites and the distribution of recent galactic star formation .",

    "* sturner & naya 1999 ) ) .",
    "spatially resolved spectroscopy , as afforded by the imaging spectrometer spi , is expected to resolve the issue , as it will make it possible to probe the imprint of the dynamics of the ism local to the @xmath0al sources and that of galactic differential rotation on shape and centroid of the 1808.6  kev line ( modelled e.g.by ( * ? ? ?",

    "the line centroid is unshifted ; the line width is intrinsically narrow with a fhwm of about 1.2  kev ( and a 2@xmath16 upper limit of 2.8  kev ) , ruling out the earlier gris result .",
    "these line parameters are consistent with expectations from the @xcite model , which for the inner galaxy predicts no line shift and a line width of about 1  kev due to galactic differential rotation ( leaving room for a small amount of additional broadening due to modest ism turbulence around the @xmath0al sources ) .",

    "this means that there must be an additional @xmath0al source ; type  ii sne do not produce enough @xmath0al .",
    "this additional source could be wr stars , because when the integration is extended up to the highest masses , taking into account the @xmath0al expelled in the wr winds , the observed @xmath1fe to @xmath0al line flux ratio can be reproduced .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that wr star yields are still uncertain , as they depend sensitively on e.g.  metallicity and rotation .",
    "the annihilation of positrons with electrons gives rise to two characteristic emissions at gamma - ray energies : the hallmark line at 511  kev , and the unique three - photon positronium ( ps ) continuum emission ( cf .",
    "* guessoum , jean , & gillard 2005 ) ) .",
    "the detailed shape of the 511  kev annihilation line , as well as the positronium fraction ( the fraction of positrons that annihilate through ps formation ) , depend on the physical properties of the annihilation media ; therefore detailed spectroscopy of the positron annihilation can provide unique information on the annihilation media and processes .",
    "positrons can be produced through a variety of processes and by a variety of objects in our galaxy .",
    "the main production processes are @xmath20 decay of radioactive nuclei ( formed in sne , novae , hypernovae , wr stars , and agb stars ) , the decay of @xmath21s resulting from interactions of energetic nuclei ( in the ism ) , pair ( electron - positron ) production in @xmath22-@xmath22 interactions ( close to compact objects and in gamma - ray bursts ) , and pair production by electrons in strong magnetic fields ( around pulsars ) .",
    "exotic processes , such as the annihilation or decay of light dark matter , have also been proposed ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* boehm  2004 ) ) . in spite of this well developed understanding of the fundamental physics of positron production , theoretical models for the positron yield of the various sources are still highly uncertain due to uncertainties concerning the astrophysical conditions in the different sources , and their galactic distribution and duty cycle .",
    "considering also the limited quality of existing observations , it is not surprising that the origin of the positrons is still poorly understood . at this stage",

    "both @xcite and @xcite searched for evidence for contributions from point sources on top of the extended emission , but none could be found in the 511  kev annihilation line and the ps continuum emission .",
