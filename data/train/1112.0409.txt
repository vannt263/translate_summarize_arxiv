    "it has been proved recently that when the charges , masses , and non - commutative parameters of a collection of exotic particles satisfy the generalized kohn conditions @xmath8 and @xmath9 , then the system of interacting `` exotic '' electrons splits into internal and center - of - mass motions , with the latter behaving as a single exotic particle @xcite .",

    "the reduced energy is hence proportional to the angular momentum , h^c= k(1+mk^2)^c .",
    "it is worth to mention that for a general ( non linear or quadratic ) potential @xmath110 the very quantization procedure is ambiguous @xcite .",
    "proceeding backwards , we generalized to non - vanishing electric fields the remarkable correspondence between the nclp and chiral oscillators , advocated before by alvarez et al . @xcite .",
    "our clue has been replacing the `` natural '' velocity - momentum relation posited in @xcite , = p / m , by including the anomalous velocity term as it is usual in the non - commutative context [ see the first condition in ( [ exoeqmot ] ) ] and , more importantly , it is required by the physical applications .",
    "it is the removal of this usual but unjustified rule which resolves the problem  just like for anyons @xcite .",
    "particular interest has been devoted to the phase transition which takes place when the magnetic field crosses the critical value @xmath114 , when the effective mass , @xmath25 , changes sign .",
    "it is intriguing to investigate what happens in the `` hall regime '' @xmath46 i.e. @xmath115 , when only those motions are consistent which satisfy the hall law .",
    "this is understood by realizing that , when @xmath50 , the rotation around the guiding center becomes more and more rapid  with the exception , precisely , of those motions which materialize that of the guiding center .",
    "the initial conditions fall hence into two categories : those which correspond to the hall law survive unscathed , whereas the others speed up more and more .",
    "such trajectories become hence more and more dense , becoming `` instantaneous '' as @xmath50 .",
    "do these `` instantaneous motions '' have any physical sense  ?",
    "it is hard to say .",
    "a footnote in ref .",
    "@xcite hints , however , at that they _ may _ contribute to the path integral  : according to an unpublished statement of klauder , there is finite propagation in infinitesimally short time .",
    "the quantum mechanical description can , just like in classical mechanics @xcite , be derived from the symmetry alone .",
    "this is analogous to the similar derivation of the h - atom spectrum form the group theory , using the @xmath116 dynamical symmetry .",
