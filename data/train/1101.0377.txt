    "recently modern information - communication - technology ( ict ) has opened us access to large amounts of stored digital data on human communication , which in turn has enabled us to have unprecedented insights into the patterns of human behavior and social interaction .",
    "for example we can now study the structure and dynamics of large - scale human communication networks  @xcite and the laws of mobility  @xcite , as well as the motifs of individual behavior  @xcite .",
    "one of the robust findings of these studies is that human activity over a variety of communication channels is inhomogeneous , such that high activity bursts of rapidly occurring events are separated by long periods of inactivity  @xcite .",
    "this feature is usually characterized by the distribution of inter - event times @xmath0 , defined as time intervals between , e.g. , consecutive e - mails sent by a single user .",
    "this distribution has been found to have a heavy tail and show a power - law decay as @xmath1  @xcite .    in human behavior",
    "obvious causes of inhomogeneity are the circadian and other longer cycles of our lives as results of natural and societal factors .",
    "malmgren  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite suggested that an approximate power - law scaling found in the inter - event time distribution of human correspondence activity is a consequence of circadian and weekly cycles affecting us all , such that the large inter - event times are attributed to nighttime and weekend inactivity .",
    "as an explanation they proposed a cascading inhomogeneous poisson process , which is a combination of two poisson processes with different time scales .",
    "one of them is characterized by the time - dependent event rate representing the circadian and weekly activity patterns , while the other corresponds to the cascading bursty behavior with a shorter time scale .",
    "their model was able to reproduce an apparent power - law behavior in the inter - event time distribution of email and postal mail correspondence .",
    "in addition they calculated the fano and allan factors to indicate the existence of some correlations for the email data as well as for their model of inhomogeneous poisson process , with quite good comparison  @xcite .",
    "however , the question remains whether in addition to the circadian and weekly cycle driven inhomogeneities there are also other correlations due to human task execution that contribute to the inhomogeneities observed in communication patterns , as suggested , e.g. , by the queuing models  @xcite .",
    "there is evidence for this by goh and barabsi  @xcite , who introduced a measure that indicates the communication patterns to have correlations .",
    "recently , wu  _ et al .",
    "_ have studied the modified version of the queuing process proposed in  @xcite by introducing a poisson process as the initiator of localized bursty activity  @xcite .",
    "this was aimed at explaining the observation that the inter - event time distributions in short message ( sm ) correspondence follow a bimodal combination of power - law and poisson distributions .",
    "the power - law ( poisson ) behavior was found dominant for @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "since the event rates extracted from the empirical data have the time scales larger than @xmath4 ( also measured empirically ) , a bimodal distribution was successfully obtained . however , in their work the effects of circadian and weekly activity patterns were not considered , thus needing to be investigated in detail .    as the circadian and weekly cycles affect human communication patterns in quite obvious ways , taking place mostly during the daytime and differently during the weekends , our aim in this paper is to remove or de - season from the data the temporal inhomogeneities driven by these cycles .",
    "then the study of the remaining de - seasoned data would enable us to get insight to the existence of other human activity driven correlations .",
    "this is important for two reasons .",
    "first , communication patterns tell about the nature of human behavior .",
    "second , in devising models of human communication behavior the different origins of inhomogeneities should be properly taken into account ; is it enough to describe the communication pattern by an inhomogeneous poissonian process or do we need a model to reflect correlations in other human activities , such as those due to task execution ?    in this paper , we provide a systematic method to de - season the circadian and weekly patterns from the mobile phone communication data .",
    "firstly , we extract the circadian and weekly patterns from the time - stamped communication records and secondly , these patterns are removed by rescaling the timings of the communication events , i.e. phone calls and sms .",
    "the rescaling is performed such that the time is dilated or contracted at times of high or low event activity , respectively .",
    "finally , we obtain the inter - event time distributions by using the rescaled timings and comparing them with the original distributions to check how the heavy tail and burstiness behavior are affected . as the main results we find that the de - seasoned data still shows heavy tail inter - event time distributions with power - law scalings thus indicating that human task execution is a possible cause of remaining burstiness in mobile phone communication .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "sect : analysis ] , we introduce the methods for de - seasoning the circadian and weekly patterns systematically in various ways . by applying these methods the values of burstiness of inter - event time distributions are obtained and subsequently discussed .",
    "finally , we summarize the results in section  [ sect : summary ] .",
    "we investigate the effect of circadian and weekly cycles on the heavy - tailed inter - event time distribution and burstiness in human activity by using the mobile phone call ( mpc ) dataset from a european operator ( national market share @xmath5 ) with time - stamped records over a period of @xmath6 days starting from january 2 , 2007 .",
    "the data of january 1 , 2007 are not considered due to its rather unusual pattern of human communication .",
    "we have only retained links with bidirectional interaction , yielding @xmath7 users , @xmath8 links , and @xmath9 events ( calls ) .",
    "for the analysis of short message ( sm ) dataset , see appendix .",
    "we perform the de - seasoning analysis by defining first the observable . for an individual service user @xmath10",
    ", @xmath11 denotes the number of events at time @xmath12 , where @xmath12 ranges from @xmath13 seconds , i.e. the start of january 2 , 2007 at midnight , to @xmath14 seconds ( 119 days ) .",
    "the total number of events @xmath15 is called the strength of user @xmath10 . in general , for a set of users @xmath16 , the number of events at time @xmath12 is denoted by @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath16 can represent one user , a set of users , or the whole population .",
    "when the period of cycle @xmath18 is given , the event rate @xmath19 with @xmath20 is defined as @xmath21 for convenience , we redefine the periodic event rate with period @xmath18 as @xmath22 with any non - negative integer @xmath23 for @xmath24 . by means of the event rate",
    ", we define the rescaled time @xmath25 as following  @xcite @xmath26 this rescaling corresponds to the transformation of the time variable by @xmath27 with @xmath28 . here",
    "@xmath28 means that there exists no cyclic pattern in the frame of rescaled time .",
    "the time is dilated ( contracted ) at the moment of high ( low ) activity .    in order to check whether the rescaling affects the inter - event time distributions and",
    "whether still some burstiness exists we reformulate the inter - event time distributions by using rescaled event times and compare them with the original distributions .",
    "the definition of the rescaled inter - event time from the rescaled time is straightforward . considering two consecutive events of a user @xmath29 occurring at times @xmath30 and @xmath31 ,",
    "the original inter - event time is @xmath32 , then the corresponding rescaled inter - event time is defined as follows @xmath33 to find out how much the de - seasoning affects burstiness , we measure the burstiness of events , as proposed in  @xcite , where the burstiness parameter @xmath34 is defined as @xmath35 here @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the standard deviation and the mean of the inter - event time distribution @xmath38 , respectively . the value of @xmath34 is bounded within the range of @xmath39 $ ] such that @xmath40 for the most bursty behavior , @xmath41 for neutral or homogeneous poisson behavior , and @xmath42 for completely regular behavior .",
    "the burstiness of the original inter - event time distribution , denoted by @xmath43 , is to be compared with that of @xmath44 of the rescaled inter - event time distribution for given period @xmath18 . with the de - seasoning the burstiness",
    "is expected to decrease and here we are most interested in by what amount the burstiness decreases when using @xmath45 day or @xmath46 days , i.e. removing the circadian or weekly patterns .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we apply the same de - seasoning analysis described in the main text to the sm dataset .",
    "figure  [ fig : sms_individual ] shows the various circadian activity patterns of individual users .",
    "the main difference from the mpc dataset is that the activity peak is around 11 pm .",
    "this feature becomes evident if the averaged event rates are obtained from the same strength groups or from the groups with broad ranges of strength , shown in the left columns of figs  [ fig : sms_strength_merge ] and  [ fig : sms_group ] .",
    "for the details of the strength dependent grouping , see table  [ table : sms_group ] .",
    "the inter - event time distributions and their values of burstiness are also compared . at first",
    ", the distributions can not be described by the simple power - law form but by the bimodal combination of power - law and poisson distributions as suggested by  @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sms_burstiness ] , the values of burstiness slowly decrease as the period @xmath18 increases up to 7 days , which implies that de - seasoning the circadian and weekly patterns does not considerably affect the bursty behavior .    finally , we perform the power spectrum analysis for sm dataset in fig .  [",
    "fig : sms_powerspec ] and find again that the cyclic patterns longer than @xmath18 can not be removed by the de - seasoning with period @xmath18 .",
    "all these results confirm our conclusion that the heavy tail and burstiness are not only the consequence of circadian and other longer cycle patterns but also due to other correlations , such as human task execution .",
