    "this is a continuation of a series of papers dedicated to the study of the distribution of neighbor denominators of farey fractions whose denominators are in arithmetic progression .",
    "previously , we have treated in @xcite , @xcite the cases of pairs of odd and even denominators , respectively , while here we deal with tuples of consecutive denominators of fractions in @xmath4 , the set of farey fractions with denominators @xmath5 .",
    "( here @xmath11 are integers , with @xmath2 and @xmath3 . )",
    "the motivation for their study comes from their role played in different problems of various complexities , varying from applications in the theory of billiards to questions concerned with the zeros of dirichlet l - functions .",
    "although the present work is mostly self - contained , the reader may refer to the authors  @xcite and the references within for a wider introduction of the context and the treatment of some calculations .",
    "two generic neighbor fractions from @xmath0 , the set of farey fractions of order @xmath1 , say @xmath12 and @xmath13 , have two intrinsic properties .",
    "firstly , the sum @xmath14 is always greater than @xmath1 and secondly , @xmath15 .",
    "none of these two properties is generally true for consecutive members of @xmath4 , but we shall see that they may be recovered as initial instances of some more complex connections",
    ".    given a positive integer @xmath16 , our main interest lies on the set of tuples of neighbor denominators of fractions in @xmath17 : @xmath18 ( notice that due to some technical constraints , in our notations , the dimension is @xmath19 and not @xmath7 . ) in fact our aim is to show that there is a limiting set @xmath20 of the scaled set of points @xmath21^{s+1}$ ] , as @xmath22 . strictly speaking ,",
    "this is the set of limit points of sequences @xmath23 , where each @xmath24 is picked from @xmath25 .",
    "more in depth information on @xmath20 is revealed if one knows the concentration of points across its expanse .",
    "the answer is given by theorem  [ theorem ] below , which shows that there exists a local density function on @xmath20 and gives an explicit expression for it .",
    "next , let us see the formal definition .",
    "let @xmath26 be a generic point in @xmath27^{s+1}$ ] and denote by @xmath28 the function that gives the local density of points @xmath29 in the @xmath19-dimensional unit cube , as @xmath6 , where @xmath9 are consecutive denominators of fractions in @xmath17 .",
    "at any point @xmath30^{s+1}$ ] , we define @xmath31 by @xmath32 where @xmath33 are cubes of edge @xmath34 centered at @xmath35 .",
    "a consequence of the fact that any sequence of consecutive denominators in @xmath36 is uniquely determined by its first two terms is the framework of @xmath20 , built as a union of two dimensional compact surfaces in @xmath37 .",
    "this is the reason for which we have divided in by the area of a square of edge @xmath34 only , and not by @xmath38 .",
    "thus , in reality @xmath39 is a function of two variables . here",
    "@xmath40 will run over a domain that embodies the farey series , the farey triangle with vertices @xmath41 ; @xmath42 ; @xmath43 denoted by @xmath44 .",
    "suppose now that @xmath45 , that is , we are in dimension two .",
    "we conclude this introduction with some remarks on the shape of @xmath46 , for different @xmath47 and @xmath48 that we have tested ( see details , tables and pictures in section  [ annex ] ) .",
    "it is likely that our observations extend over all @xmath47 and @xmath2 .",
    "the first thing to be remarked is the fact that for any @xmath2 , @xmath46 is a polygon obtained as a union of some sequences of polygons with constant local density on each of them , one of them always including all the others . but",
    "the most noteworthy property is that each of these constant density polygons has a vertex at @xmath43 and looks like a mosaic composed by polygonal pieces , most of them being quadrangles .",
    "the fact that the mosaics exist is not just an accidental occurrence ; on the contrary , more and more pieces fit into mosaics with a larger and larger number of components as @xmath48 increases .",
    "the mosaics are either symmetric with respect to the first diagonal or they appear in pairs , whose components are symmetric to each other with respect to the first diagonal .",
    "it is not true , as one would guess from tests with many acceptably small @xmath48 s and different @xmath47 s , that the larger mosaic ( most likely equal to @xmath46 ) is always a quadrangle .",
    "the first counter - example is @xmath49 , which is a hexagon ( see fig .  [ mosaic_312_11 ] ) .",
    "the shape of the mosaics is more regular when @xmath48 has fewer prime factors . in particular , for each prime modulus @xmath48 , the exterior frame of all the mosaics is the same with that from the case @xmath50 , @xmath51 ( cf .",
    "* fig . 5 , 6 ) ) , which in turn was the same in the case @xmath50 , @xmath52 ( cf .",
    "mosaics having exactly the same form appear , for example , also when @xmath53 , @xmath51 , merely than each of them occurs twice .",
    "as opposed to the prime modulus instance , we have included in section  [ annex ] the pictures that appear in the case @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "one may appreciate these mosaics for their unexpected shape and beauty .",
    "suppose the integer @xmath1 is sufficiently large , but fixed .",
    "we also fix @xmath2 , the modulus , @xmath3 , the residue class , and an integer @xmath16 ( @xmath19 is the dimension ) .",
    "then , we define recursively the following objects . for @xmath56 ,",
    "let @xmath57 be given by @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , for @xmath61 , where @xmath62 $ ] .",
    "we say that @xmath63 are _ generators _ of @xmath64 , and of @xmath65 also , or that @xmath64 and @xmath65 are _ generated _ by @xmath63 .    in order to get a sequence of consecutive denominators of fractions in @xmath0 it suffices to know only the first two of them .",
    "moreover , any two coprime integers @xmath66 , with @xmath67 , appear exactly once in the sequence of consecutive denominators of fractions in @xmath0 .",
    "then , the subsequent denominators are obtained as follows .",
    "given two neighbor denominators @xmath66 , they are succeeded by @xmath68 , where @xmath69 , for @xmath61 , and @xmath70 $ ] .",
    "we put @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "notice that this values of @xmath73 coincide with those defined above if @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "then , in order to simplify the notation , we write @xmath76 instead of @xmath77 . as before",
    ", we say that @xmath78 are _ generators _ of @xmath79 and of @xmath65 or that @xmath79 and @xmath65 are _ generated _ by @xmath78 .",
    "a good way to look at a tuple @xmath80 is to think that it is associated to the whole @xmath81-tuple @xmath82 of consecutive denominators in @xmath0 .",
    "we remark that the link between @xmath65 and @xmath83 is also made by the relations : @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , etc .",
    "it is plain that @xmath88 , for @xmath61 .",
    "additionally , we need to extend the definition of @xmath65 to the case @xmath89 . then @xmath65 is empty , that is it has no components , and we say that its order is zero .    in general , consecutive fractions in @xmath4",
    "are not necessarily consecutive in @xmath0 , but have intercalated in - between several other fractions from @xmath0 .",
    "we remark also that , in general , consecutive denominators of fractions in @xmath4 are not necessarily coprime .",
    "let @xmath90 be an @xmath7-tuple of positive integers , and denote @xmath91 .",
    "we say that @xmath92 , a tuple of consecutive denominators of fractions in @xmath4 , is _ of type _",
    "@xmath93 if @xmath94 if all the components of @xmath83 are @xmath5 . ] and there exists @xmath95 a pair of consecutive denominators in @xmath0 with @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 , for @xmath99 . in this case we also say that the tuple @xmath100 , with @xmath101 is _ of type _",
    "@xmath102 . to select the components that are @xmath103 , we define the _ choice application _",
    "@xmath104 , with @xmath105 similarly , for @xmath106 $ ] , with @xmath107 , we also put @xmath108    let @xmath109 be the set of all @xmath110 of type @xmath111 , for any @xmath78 .",

    "one can find in @xmath117 the following series of consecutive fractions : @xmath118 from these only @xmath119 survive , and are consecutive , in @xmath120 .",
    "then , in our terminology , the tuple of denominators @xmath121 is of type @xmath93 , with @xmath122 . in particular , we see that @xmath123 are , respectively , the number of denominators of consecutive fractions in @xmath36 that are @xmath124 intercalated between the fractions with denominators that are @xmath5 . also , @xmath125 has @xmath126 components , and @xmath127",

    "let @xmath48 be a positive integer and let @xmath129 , with @xmath136 .",
    "then @xmath137    the proof follows by a standard argument , as in the proof of  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 3.1 ) .    as a corollary of lemma  [ lno ]",
    ", we obtain an asymptotic formula for the cardinality of @xmath138 . for this",
    "we use and two more facts .",
    "firstly , the area of the farey triangle is @xmath139 and secondly , the number of residue classes @xmath140 that are relatively prime to @xmath47 is @xmath141 .",
    "( here @xmath142 is the euler totient function ) .",
    "then , we have @xmath143",
    "we count separately the contribution to @xmath144 of points of the same type .",
    "thus , we denote by @xmath145 , the local density in the unit cube @xmath27^{s+1}$ ] of the points @xmath29 of type @xmath102 , as @xmath146 . at any point @xmath30^{s+1}$ ] , this local density @xmath147 is defined by @xmath148 where @xmath33 are cubes of edge @xmath34 centered at @xmath35 .",
    "then , we have @xmath149 provided we show that each local density @xmath147 exists , as @xmath146 . in the following we find each @xmath147 .",
    "the variable @xmath150 is for now fixed , but eventually will tend to zero .",
    "when @xmath197 , for each @xmath65 the polygons @xmath162 are smaller and smaller and converge toward a point @xmath198 , which we call the _ core _ of @xmath162 . if @xmath45 , @xmath162 is a parallelogram and the core of @xmath162 coincides with its center given by .",

    "so , the size of @xmath214 is independent of @xmath193 .",
    "notice that @xmath216 is generally smaller than @xmath217 , and even smaller than @xmath218 .",
    "then , we have @xmath219    if @xmath220 , the reasoning from the previous case shows that there exists @xmath221 , with the property that for @xmath222 the polygons @xmath223 are similar to each other",

    "this is the object of the next section .",
    "the integer values @xmath73 defined in section  [ section1 ] satisfy the classical _ mediant _ property of the farey series .",
    "for instance , if @xmath165 are consecutive denominators of three fractions in @xmath0 , then @xmath166 is a positive integer .",
    "hall and shiu  @xcite called it the _ index _ of the fractions with denominators @xmath78 , respectively .",
    "more generally , for a series of indices @xmath167 , we consider a sequence of polynomials @xmath168 , defined as follows .",

    "in particular , one sees that @xmath176 coincides with the index of hall and shiu .",
    "also , we remark the symmetry property : @xmath177 the role played by these polynomials is revealed by the next relation , which shows that for any @xmath178 , @xmath179 is a linear combination of @xmath180 and @xmath181 : @xmath182    turning now to the set @xmath183 defined by  , where @xmath184 , by we see that this is the set of points @xmath185 that satisfy simultaneously the conditions : @xmath186 this shows that @xmath162 is the intersection of @xmath19 strips and for @xmath187 the sets @xmath188 and @xmath189 are similar , the ratio of similarity being equal to @xmath190 .",
    "consequently , it follows that @xmath191 and @xmath192 is independent of @xmath193 .    in particular , in the case @xmath45 , for @xmath194 ,",

    "[ corollary ] there exists a limiting set @xmath237 , as @xmath6 .    when @xmath45 , the theorem can be stated more precisely using .",
    "[ corollary1 ] let @xmath2 and @xmath3 be integers .",
    "then , for any @xmath238^{2}$ ] , we have @xmath239 where the sums run over all @xmath240 and @xmath241 .",
    "corollary  [ corollary1 ] with @xmath50 retrieves the authors  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3 ) as a particular instance .",
    "the noteworthy thing hidden in the background of theorem  [ theorem2 ] is the geometry of the arrangements of the domains @xmath242 , which we call _ pieces _ or _ tiles_. it is easier to see this in the bidimensional case , @xmath45 , assumed in what follows .",
    "then the tiles are polygons included in @xmath27 ^ 2 $ ] and the choice application becomes @xmath243    for any @xmath80 , we shall call _ kernel _ the integer @xmath244 .",
    "moreover , we say that it is the kernel of the tile @xmath245 .",
    "notice that the inverse of the kernel is the contribution of each @xmath65 to @xmath246 .",
    "the tiles of a given kernel fit into a few larger polygons , which we call _ mosaics_.",
    "their common feature is that always one of their vertices is at @xmath43 .",
    "they are either symmetric with respect to the first diagonal or they appear in pairs , symmetric to each other with respect to the first diagonal .",
    "most of them are quadrangles , but their shape may vary a lot with @xmath48 , @xmath47 and the value of the kernel .",
    "these mosaics behave like successive layers of constant density put over @xmath27 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "then the local density @xmath246 at a given point @xmath247 ^ 2 $ ] is the sum of the densities on the mosaics ( the inverse of its kernel ) stung by @xmath248 .",
    "the contribution to the sum is halved if @xmath248 touches only an edge of a mosaic , and if the point touches a vertex of a mosaic , it adds to the sum the density reduced proportionally with the size of the angle of the mosaic at that vertex .",
    "the number of mosaics that lay over @xmath249 is finite , and it is endless if @xmath250 .    for each given @xmath11 ,",
    "the number of the mosaics is unbounded , but their size has a certain rate of decay as their kernel increases . in the appendix",
    "we have included the larger mosaics in two moduli : @xmath116 and @xmath54 .",
    "it seems that the set @xmath46 is always equal to the first mosaic , which happens to be the largest .",
    "this is known to be true when @xmath48 is small and in the cases @xmath51 and @xmath48 prime  @xcite .",
    "many other intriguing questions are raised by these objects . here , we conclude only by pointing out that each of these mosaics has an associated tree . in the nodes",
    "the tree has the tuples @xmath65 that define the tiles and the arcs link nodes whose corresponding tiles are adjacent on the mosaic .",
    "the root node corresponds to the tile with a vertex at @xmath43 . as an example , in figure  [ tree ] , it is the tree associated to the mosaic @xmath251 $ ] from figure  [ mosaic_25_91 ] .",
