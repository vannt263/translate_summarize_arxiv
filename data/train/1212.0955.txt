    "the analysis of the phases of strong interactions presents many fascinating aspects  mechanisms of confinement , different realisations of the chiral symmetry , the nature of the symmetric phase , the emergence of conformality , and many others .",
    "all these topics are under active scrutiny both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "while strong interactions spontaneously break chiral symmetry in ordinary qcd at zero temperature , the chiral symmetry is realised either at high temperatures  in the so - called quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase  and at a large number of flavours @xmath14 ( even at zero temperature ) @xcite . in the latter case",
    ", the theory is expected to become not only chirally but also conformally invariant .",
    "this is due to the emergence of an infra - red fixed point ( irfp ) for @xmath14 at a coupling which is not strong enough to break chiral symmetry .",
    "both physics intuition and phenomenological analysis based on functional renormalisation group  @xcite and finite temperature holographic qcd @xcite indicate that the conformal phase of cold , many flavour qcd and the high temperature chirally symmetric phase are continuously connected . in particular , the onset of the conformal window coincides with the vanishing of the transition temperature , and the conformal window appears as a zero temperature limit of a possibly strongly interacting qgp .",
    "the analysis of the finite temperature phase transition is a well - established line of research within the lattice community , and our approach will be completely conventional here .",
    "according to the pisarski - wilczek scenario  @xcite , the most likely possibility for @xmath15 is a first order chiral transition in the chiral limit , turning into a crossover above a critical mass endpoint , and/or on lattices which are not large enough",
    ". we will identify such crossover with confidence for a number of flavours ranging from four to eight , and we will complement these results with those of the deconfinement transition in the quenched model . then , we study the approach to the conformal phase in the light of the chiral phase transition at finite temperature with variable number of flavours .    one problem of this approach is the setting of a common scale among theories which are essentially different .",
    "we will propose two alternative possibilities to handle this problem , one evolving from our previous work @xcite , and the other from a recent analysis @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this latter approach analyses the dependence of the confinement parameters on the matter content , and proposes microscopic mechanisms for confinement motivated by such @xmath4 dependence .",
    "further , we will argue that even results in the bare lattice parameters can be used directly to locate the critical number of flavours , thus generalising to finite temperature the miransky - yamawaki phase diagram , ref .",

    "a second zero of the two - loop beta - function of a non - abelian gauge theory implies , at least perturbatively , the appearance of irfp conformal symmetry @xcite . in colour su(@xmath16 ) gauge theory with @xmath4 massless fundamental fermions , the second zero appears at @xmath17 , before the loss of asymptotic freedom ( laf ) at @xmath18 .",
    "analytic studies of the conformal transition of strong interactions have produced a variety of predictions for the conformal threshold : the schwinger - dyson approach with rainbow resummations @xcite or the functional renormalisation group method @xcite suggest the onset of conformal window around @xmath19 .",
    "an all - order perturbative beta - function @xcite inspired by the nsvz beta - function of sqcd @xcite leads to a bound @xmath20 .",
    "instanton studies at large @xmath4 @xcite claimed a qualitative change of behaviour at @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 has also been estimated for different fermion representations @xcite .    the sub ",
    "critical region , when @xmath4 gets closer and closer to @xmath5 , is interesting per se : the question is whether the chiral dynamics there shows any difference with the standard qcd dynamics .",
    "significant differences with respect to the qcd dynamics might offer a basis to model builders interested in beyond - the  standard  model theories .",
    "the recent discovery of a 125 gev boson at the lhc poses the question as to whether there are light composite scalars which might be identified with such boson , in alternative to a standard model higgs boson .",
    "conformal dynamics might well help these studies  @xcite . in our study",
    ", such pre - conformal dynamics could manifest itself either with a clear observation of a separation of scales , or with a manifestation of a critical behaviour when approaching @xmath5 .",
    "one possibility is to observe the miransky - yamawaki essential singularity  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , in an frg approach  @xcite , the pseudo - critical line is almost linear with @xmath4 for small @xmath4 , and displays a singular behaviour when approaching @xmath5 , which could be the only observable effects , beyond miransky scaling .",
    "a _ jumping _",
    "scenario in which the change from a qcd dynamics to the conformal window is abrupt is also a distinct possibility @xcite .",
    "clearly , as in any system undergoing a phase transition , the nature and extent of the critical window are purely dynamical questions whose answer can not be guessed a priori . since",
    "the underlying dynamics is completely non - perturbative , lattice calculations are the only tool to perform an ab initio , rigorous study of these phenomena , and many lattice studies have recently appeared  @xcite .",
    "this paper is one step of our ongoing program @xcite@xcite which aims at elucidating the phase diagram of qcd with fundamental fermions on the lattice , and in the continuum .",
    "further studies either with fundamental fermions @xcite  @xcite or other representations @xcite have contributed to our current understanding of this challenging field . however , only a subset of these studies has addressed issues related with pre  conformal dynamics @xcite @xcite , @xcite which are the main theme of this paper .",
    "the direct inspection of theories at fixed @xmath4 is often inconclusive , especially close to the expected threshold @xmath5 . also because of this ,",
    "we feel it is a useful approach to try to observe directly the approach to conformality by monitoring the evolution of the pre ",

    ", @xmath21 and @xmath3 is expected to be in the important regime as suggested by the results in refs .",
    "we combine our findings with those of our early work for @xmath21 and @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this paper grows out of our early study @xcite and extends it in several ways : we have accumulated more statistics and added more parameters , and we present here an extended set of simulations and details .",
    "we develop a new scale setting procedure , so that we can more confidently measure the critical temperature on a common reference scale among theories with different flavour content .",
    "furthermore , we present new estimates of the critical number of flavours @xmath5 .",
    "partly motivated by the recent work @xcite , we introduce a typical interaction strength @xmath8 at the critical temperature based on our lattice results , and compare it with a four - loop irfp coupling ( @xmath24 )  @xcite and a critical coupling ( @xmath25 ) estimated by using a two - loop schwinger - dyson equation  @xcite .",
    "further , we introduce and discuss the finite temperature version of the miransky - yamawaki phase diagram , and propose a strategy to locate the critical number of flavour motivated by the properties of the lattice step - scaling function in the vicinity of the irfp @xcite . some of the new results presented here have been anticipated in a recent proceeding , and talks@xcite .",

    "we have measured the susceptibilities @xmath64 and @xmath65 separately .",
    "the disconnected chiral susceptibility is a non - local quantity which can be estimated from the variance of the bulk behaviour of the chiral condensate .",

    ", the susceptibility ratio @xmath74 should be one in chirally symmetric regime due to the degeneracy of the chiral partners , while it should be zero in the spontaneously broken phase . even including a finite bare fermion mass",

    "in particular , @xmath75 in the chirally symmetric regime holds true till the chiral condensate is dominated by the linear mass term contribution .",
    "it turns out that @xmath76 allows the identification of a pseudo - critical coupling @xmath1 associated with the chiral crossover , which , in the cases we have studied , coincides in the error with the pseudo - critical coupling determined from the maximum of the chiral susceptibility .    in the gauge sector",
