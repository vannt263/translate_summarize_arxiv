    "* ) m1ve flare star @xcite with the young age of @xmath5  myr @xcite , a key epoch in the formation of planetary systems .",
    "the star is surrounded by a nearly edge - on circumstellar disk discovered in coronographic images of scattered starlight that extends to a radius of at least 210  au @xcite .",
    "since the small grains responsible for scattering should be removed rapidly by stellar pressure forces , the disk is thought to consist of the collisional debris of unseen planetesimals experiencing ongoing impacts ( for recent reviews of the debris disk phenomenon , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "because of its proximity , the au  mic debris disk has become one of the best studied examples at optical and infrared wavelengths , including detailed imagery of both intensity and polarization from the _ hubble space telescope _ @xcite .",
    "many observational properties of the au  mic debris disk bear striking similarities to the archetype debris disk surrounding @xmath2  pic , also viewed nearly edge - on and located in the same young moving group . in particular , the midplane optical surface brightness profiles of these disks are remarkably alike , with shallow inner slopes ( @xmath6 ) that steepen substantially ( @xmath7 ) in the outer regions , near 35  au and 100  au for au  mic and @xmath2  pic , respectively @xcite .",
    "these similarities inspired the development of a unified framework for debris disks based on a localized belt of planetesimals , or `` birth ring '' , that produces dust in a collisional cascade @xcite .",
    "the smallest grains are blown out from the belt by radiation and winds from the star , larger grains are launched into eccentric orbits with the same periastron as the belt , and the largest grains , which are minimally affected by non - gravitational forces , do not travel far from the belt before being ground down . the grains are therefore segregated according to their size , which gives rise to the characteristic scattered light profile . for these dynamics to prevail , the disks must be substantially free of gas @xcite , a property confirmed by measurements at ultraviolet wavelengths @xcite .    a `` birth ring '' ,",
    "if present , would remain hidden in optical and infrared images dominated by small grains that populate an extended halo ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "by contrast , observations at ( sub)millimeter wavelengths highlight thermal emission from the largest grains and hence the location of the dust - producing planetesimals @xcite . to date , the best case for a `` birth ring '' comes from millimeter observations of @xmath2  pic @xcite .",
    "while the optical disk of @xmath2  pic extends more than @xmath8  au from the star , the millimeter imaging reveals a much more compact belt of emission at @xmath9  au radius .",
    "this millimeter emission belt coincides with the change in the slope of the optical surface brightness , which in the models marks the outer extent of the colliding planetesimals .",
    "previous ( sub)millimeter - wave observations of au mic did not have sufficient angular resolution to reveal much about the emission morphology .",
    "a detection at 850  @xmath10 m using jcmt / scuba ( @xmath11 beam ) indicated a reservoir of cold dust with mass @xmath12  m@xmath13 , but did not resolve any structure @xcite .",
    "subsequent observations at 350  @xmath10 m using cso / sharc  ii ( @xmath14 beam ) marginally resolved an orientation compatible with the scattered light , but were otherwise limited @xcite . in this _",

    "the passband shape for each track was calibrated using available bright sources , mainly j1924 - 292 .",
    "the absolute flux scale was set with an accuracy of @xmath21 using observations of callisto or ganymede in each track .",
    "all of the calibration steps were performed using the idl based mir software , and imaging and deconvolution were done with standard routines in the miriad package .",

    "the synthesized beam size for this 1.3  millimeter image is @xmath22 ( @xmath23  au ) , position angle @xmath24 , obtained with natural weighting and an elliptical gaussian taper @xmath25 ( fwhm ) oriented east - west to make the beam shape more circular . the rms noise in this image is 0.40  mjy  beam@xmath26 , and the individual peaks have a signal - to - noise @xmath27 .",
    "the star symbol marks the stellar position corrected for proper motion , offset by @xmath28 from the phase center .",
    "the image shows a resolved band of 1.3 millimeter emission that extends approximately symmetrically from the stellar position to the southeast and northwest . by fitting a line to the positions of the two peaks in the image",
    ", we estimate the position angle of the emission structure to be @xmath29 , in excellent agreement with the disk orientation inferred from scattered light observations @xcite . from its position angle and double peaked morphology , we identify the emission structure as a limb - brightened dust belt .",
    "note that thermal emission from the stellar photosphere contributes only @xmath30  mjy at this wavelength , and even the strongest synchrotron radio flares from stellar activity should remain well below the noise @xcite . the total flux density obtained by integrating over a box that surrounds",
    "the emission is @xmath31  mjy , where the uncertainty is estimated conservatively by evaluating boxes of the same size in emission - free regions of the image .",
    "no other significant features are detected in the field of view .",
    "an extrapolation of the measurements at shorter wavelengths indicates that missing flux due to the spatial filtering by the sma is not a significant issue for these observations . the spectral index between 350  @xmath10 m @xcite and 850  @xmath10 m @xcite is @xmath32 , which predicts @xmath33  mjy at 1.3  millimeters , in good agreement with the sma measurement .",
    "this shallow index is consistent , within the uncertainties , with values near 2.0 determined for a sample of debris disks by @xcite , notably for stars later than f - type where dust temperatures are so low that the rayleigh - jeans approximation in this part of the spectrum is invalid .",
    "we conclude that the compact structure detected by the sma accounts for all of the 1.3  millimeter emission in the au  mic system .      to characterize the millimeter emission structure , we use a simple parametric disk model , following closely the method used by @xcite for analyzing similar observations of the @xmath2  pic disk .",
    "we assume the emission arises from a geometrically thin , axisymmetric belt with a radial surface brightness profile given by @xmath34 .",
    "this functional form is intended to capture the essence of low optical depth emission from a disk with a spatially invariant dust emissivity , surface density profile @xmath35 , and temperature profile that falls off with radius as a power - law .",
    "we fix the power - law index @xmath36 to approximate radiative heating from the central star , and we consider two shapes for @xmath35 : ( 1 ) an annulus with power law slope , @xmath37 for @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and ( 2 ) a gaussian , @xmath40}$ ] . in each case , the model is described by three parameters : a center radius @xmath41 , width @xmath42 , and total flux density @xmath43 .",
    "we fix the disk inclination at @xmath44 and position angle at @xmath45 , as determined from scattered light data @xcite , and place the origin within @xmath46 of the nominal stellar position ( within the sma astrometric accuracy ) .",
    "note that the vertical thickness of the millimeter grain population is expected to be @xmath47 @xcite , negligible compared to the resolution of the data .",
    "the utility of this simple modeling approach is to provide basic constraints while avoiding the multitudinous assumptions about grain properties , dynamics , and radiative transfer required in more sophisticated treatments .    to estimate the model parameters and their uncertainties , we calculate three - dimensional grids spanning appropriate ranges of the parameter values .",
    "for the gaussian model , the grid covers @xmath48  au and @xmath49  au in 1  au steps , and @xmath50  mjy in 0.2  mjy steps . for each position in a model grid",
    ", we compute a set of synthetic sma visibilities and compare directly to the data with a @xmath51 value ( the sum of real and imaginary components over all spatial frequencies ) that uses natural weights modified by the gaussian taper used for the image in figure  [ fig : image ] .",
    "the rightmost panel of figure  [ fig : model ] shows the @xmath51 surface in the @xmath52 plane for the gaussian model after marginalizing over @xmath53 .",
    "the best - fit model is marked by a cross , and the contours delineate ( marginalized ) @xmath54 intervals in @xmath55 .",
    "the best - fit center radius is @xmath56  au , with corresponding width @xmath57  au ( or fwhm = @xmath58  au ) and flux density @xmath59  mjy .",
    "the three lefthand panels of figure  [ fig : model ] show the original 1.3  millimeter image from figure  [ fig : image ] , the gaussian model image obtained using the best - fit parameter values and the same visibility weighting scheme , and the imaged residuals ( where data@xmath60model subtraction is conducted on the visibilities ) .",
    "this comparison shows clearly that the best - fit model reproduces the main features of the image and leaves no systematic residuals .",
    "the power - law models for @xmath35 give similar best - fit parameter values : for @xmath61 , we find @xmath62  au and @xmath63  au ( where the upper limit is set by the computational grid boundary ) .",
    "for @xmath64 , the best - fit locus is shifted to roughly @xmath65 larger values of @xmath41 , a manifestation of the degeneracy between the radial gradient and emission extent .",
    "all of these best - fit models reproduce the observed sma visibilities equally well ( i.e. , have effectively the same minimum @xmath51 values ) .",
    "the modest signal - to - noise of the observations preclude placing tighter constraints on the model parameters .",
    "nonetheless , it is reassuring that consistent results are obtained from the various assumptions about the emission morphology .",
    "each gives a similar center radius , as well as an effectively cleared central cavity with size compatible with that inferred from scattered light ( @xmath66  au * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the lack of mid - infrared emission ( @xmath67  au * ? ? ?",
    "the best - fit gaussian model reproduces better the contrast of the maxima to the extended emission of the disk in the image plane , but there is no clear preference for any of the functional forms . of course",
    ", none of these _ ad hoc _ models are perfect , and more sensitive data will be needed to constrain further the details of the emission distribution .",
    "we have spatially resolved the thermal emission at 1.3 millimeters from the au  mic debris disk , thereby revealing the distribution of its millimeter grain population .",
    "these large grains are expected to have dynamics similar to the unseen dust - producing planetesimals , and the emission at this long wavelength provides a direct link to their spatial distribution .",
    "the overall structure of the au  mic millimeter emission is reproduced well by a belt surrounding the star centered near a radius of @xmath68  au .",
    "the inferred location of this emission belt coincides with the region over which the scattered light brightness profile of the disk steepens markedly , the feature that provided impetus for developing the `` birth ring '' model . like au  mic s more massive sister star @xmath2  pic @xcite",
    ", the resolved multi - wavelength data are consistent with a scenario where destructive collisions of planetesimals within the belt create grains with a spectrum of sizes , and the effects of size - dependent dust dynamics generate the millimeter emission and spatially extended scattered light nebula . for @xmath2  pic ,",
    "the intense stellar radiation pressure can account for the large halo of small grains in the outer disk .",
    "but for au  mic , which is about two orders of magnitude less luminous , the much weaker stellar radiation field is apparently augmented by a stellar wind to expel small grains @xcite .",
    "though the fractional radial extent of the au  mic millimeter emission is not strongly constrained , the best - fit models suggest that it could be broad , @xmath69 . for @xmath2  pic",
    ", the millimeter emission is characterized by @xmath70 , with the upper end favored for the width of the underlying dust - producing planetesimal belt from detailed models of the knee of the scattered light profile @xcite .",
    "such broad belts are not unusual features of debris disks , in particular among the few resolved at millimeter wavelengths @xcite .",
    "an inner cavity devoid of dust is plausibly maintained by the combination of grinding collisions in the belt and clearing by stellar radiation forces , though a tenable alternative is that the inner regions are swept clear by a planet .",
    "planets seem to be the most viable explanation for the millimeter cavities common to the gas - rich transition disks around younger , pre - main - sequence stars @xcite .",
    "while a planet has been imaged to orbit within the cavity in the disk around @xmath2  pic @xcite , direct evidence for planets in the au mic system remains elusive , both from high contrast imaging observations @xcite and from transit searches @xcite .",
    "the outer boundary of the emission belts may reflect the outer extent of successful planetesimal formation , or it may simply mark the edge of the region where the planetesimal stirring mechanism has been successful at initiating dust - producing collisions , as in the models of @xcite .",
    "these new millimeter observations of au  mic show the global structure of large grains in its debris disk , but they do not have sufficient resolution and sensitivity to reveal any significant departures from axisymmetry or substructure that might result from gravitational interactions with unseen planets .",
    "the higher resolution images of scattered light clearly show several radial and vertical inhomogeneities at subarcsecond scales ( features a - e , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if these substructures have counterparts at millimeter wavelengths , then future observations with the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) may be able to detect them , pinpoint the location of parent bodies , and constrain their origins ."
