    "the total and differential yields of hadrons in leptonuclear reactions reflect the space - time structure of the quark string fragmentation and the formation of hadrons , both produced directly or as a result of secondary intranuclear interactions or originated from the decays of resonances .",
    "the latters play a significant role in the production of stable hadrons ( pions and kaons ) .",
    "for example , in the case of neutrino - induced reactions the fraction of pions from the decays of light meson resonances ( up to masses @xmath20 1 gev/@xmath21 ) composes about 20 - 40% , depending on the pion type and the neutrino energy @xmath22 ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the information on the space - time structure of the hadron formation based only on the data on stable hadrons would , therefore , be rather incomplete and should be complemented by the data on the resonance production .",
    "the latter data themselves provide more direct information on the quark string fragmentation , since they are , in general , expected to be less contaminated by a contribution from the decays of the higher - mass resonances .",
    "this contribution can be rather different for various resonances and in various kinematical regions of their production .",
    "in particular , in neutrino - induced reactions the production of a favorable resonance , which can carry a large fraction of the current quark energy and hence occupies the forward hemisphere in the hadronic c.m.s .",
    "( with @xmath2 , @xmath3 being the feynman variable ) , is contributed by the decay of the higher - mass resonances mainly at @xmath23 , but to a much smaller extent at @xmath2 .",
    "the situation with unfavorable resonances ( not containing the current quark ) can be rather different .",
    "an interesting example is @xmath15 meson .",
    "+ note first of all , that the neutrinoproduction of direct @xmath15 mesons , both unfavorable and especially favorable , is expected to be strongly suppressed as compared to other favorable vector mesons , for example , @xmath24 meson ( with the same spin and isospin ) which can be produced via the main subprocess @xmath25 followed by the recombination of the current @xmath26- quark with a @xmath27- antiquark created at the string breaking .",
    "the production of a favorable @xmath15 meson , which proceeds via the subprocess @xmath28 followed by the recombination with a @xmath29- quark , is triple - suppressed as compared to the @xmath24 production due to : i ) the suppressed magnitude of the @xmath30 element of cabibo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix @xcite ; ii ) the strangeness suppression in the quark string fragmentation @xcite ; iii ) the smallness of the fraction of the nucleon momentum ( integrated over the bjorken @xmath31 variable ) carried by the @xmath27- antiquark as compared to that for the @xmath32- quark ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the product of these suppression factors is about @xmath33 .",
    "even when taking into account the contribution from the competing recombination processes , e.g. @xmath34 for the case of @xmath24 and @xmath35 for the case of @xmath0 , the expected ratio of the yields of favorable @xmath0 and @xmath24 mesons remains very small , no more than @xmath36 .",
    "+ this value is in strict contrast with experimentally estimated ratio @xmath37 at @xmath2 @xcite , indicating on the dominant role of indirect processes in the @xmath15 neutrinoproduction .",
    "one of them is , probably , related to the production of the charmed , strange @xmath1 meson via the subprocess on a strange sea quark , @xmath38 , followed by the recombination of the charm quark with the sea @xmath39- antiquark from the nucleon remnant , @xmath40 . since here",
    "no creation of an extra @xmath41 pair is necessary , the @xmath1 meson can carry the overwhelming fraction @xmath42 of the current @xmath11- quark energy and then transfer a significant part of the latter to the @xmath15 meson in @xmath43 decays ( which occur with a summary rate 16.1@xmath441.6% @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative subprocess , leading to the @xmath1 production ( with approximately the same probability as in the previous case ) , is @xmath45 followed by the recombination of the @xmath11- quark with a @xmath39- antiquark created at the string breaking . in this case",
    ", however , @xmath1 carries on an average a lesser energy fraction @xmath42 .",
    "+ this work is devoted to the experimental study of the neutrinoproduction of @xmath15 and @xmath1 mesons , with a particular aim to check the aforesaid mechanism of the indirect @xmath15 production . in section 2 , the experimental procedure is described .",
    "section 3 presents the experimental data on the total and differential yields of @xmath15 meson . in section 4 ,",
    "several decay modes of @xmath1 meson are analyzed and an estimation of its yields is inferred for the case of the leading @xmath1 meson carrying the overwhelming fraction @xmath46 of the current quark energy .",
    "the results are summarized in section 5 .",
    "the experiment was performed with skat bubble chamber @xcite , exposed to a wideband neutrino beam obtained with a 70 gev primary protons from the serpukhov accelerator .",
    "the chamber was filled with a propane - freon mixture containing 87 vol% propane ( @xmath47 ) and 13 vol% freon ( @xmath48 ) with the percentage of nuclei h : c : f : br = 67.9:26.8:4.0:1.3 % .",
    "a 20 kg uniform magnetic field was provided within the operating chamber volume .",
    "+ charged current ( @xmath49 ) interactions containing a negative muon with momentum @xmath500.5 gev / c were selected .",
    "other negatively charged particles were considered to be @xmath51 mesons , except for the cases explained below . protons with momentum below 0.6 gev@xmath52 and a fraction of protons with momentum 0.6 - 0.85",
    "gev@xmath52 were identified by their stopping in the chamber .",
    "non - identified positively charged particles were considered to be @xmath53 mesons , except for the cases explained below .",
    "events in which errors in measuring the momenta of all charged secondaries and photons were less than 60% and 100% , respectively , were selected .",
    "the mean relative error @xmath54 in the momentum measurement for muons , pions and gammas was , respectively , 3% , 6.5% and 19% .",
    "each event is given a weight which corrects for the fraction of events excluded due to improperly reconstruction .",
    "more details concerning the experimental procedure , in particular , the estimation of the neutrino energy @xmath55 and the reconstuction of @xmath56 and neutral strange particle decays can be found in our previous publications @xcite .",
    "+ the events with @xmath57 30 gev were accepted , provided that the reconstructed mass @xmath9 of the hadronic system exceeds @xmath58 = 2 gev .",

    "the number of accepted events was 4577 ( 5784 weighted events ) .",

    "this contribution was subtracted using the method described in @xcite .",
    "+ when considering the production of resonances decaying into charged kaons , the @xmath65 and @xmath66 hypothesis was applied , respectively , for negatively charged particles and non - identified positively charged particles with momenta @xmath67 gev@xmath52 , introducing thereat proper corrections for the momentum of these particles .",

    "the @xmath69 effective mass distributions for three different ranges of @xmath3 are plotted in figure 1 .",
    "the main problem in the @xmath0 signal separation is the large background from misidentified @xmath70 pairs having small effective masses .",
    "the background related to the correlated low - mass @xmath70 from @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 decays was subtracted from experimental distributions using the data on these resonances obtained in @xcite . to describe the remaining ( combinatorial ) background ,",

    "we have also obtained the @xmath58- dependence of @xmath87 and found it to increase continuously from @xmath88 at @xmath58 = 1.8 gev @xcite to @xmath89 and @xmath90 at @xmath58 = 2.6 gev and 2.9 gev , respectively .",
    "+ the differential spectrum @xmath91 , compared to that for @xmath92 meson @xcite ( at @xmath93 gev ) , is presented in figure 2 , from which two observations emerge .",
    "firstly , unlike @xmath15 meson , the yield of @xmath92 in the backward hemisphere is not much smaller than that in the forward hemisphere .",
    "this fact can be explained @xcite by a contribution from secondary intranuclear interactions of pions , @xmath94 , resulting in a @xmath92 multiplicity gain , mainly at @xmath23 .",
    "nothing similar happens with @xmath0 , due to a much smaller probability of the @xmath0 production in secondary interactions ( see section 5 for details ) .",

    "the yield of @xmath0 is more concentrated around moderate positive values of @xmath3 , indicating on its origin from the decay of a favorable leading resonance .",
    "a probably candidate for the latter is , as it was mentioned in introduction , the charmed , strange @xmath1 meson the production of which is considered in the next section .",
    "as it was mentioned above , the @xmath3- dependence of the @xmath0 meson yield indicates on its origin from the decay of leading @xmath1 mesons which can be produced , for example , in exclusive reactions @xmath97 and @xmath98 with the vector @xmath99 state decaying into @xmath100 ( 94.2% ) or @xmath101 ( 5.8% ) , a nucleon remnant @xmath102 ( turning into a nucleon or a low - state resonance ) , and a hyperon @xmath103 .",
