    "the study of the turbulence in superfluids - atomic bose - einstein condensates and liquid helium ii @xcite - help us to understand better issues of classical euler fluid dynamics @xcite . in a superfluid the rotational motion can only take the form of vortex filaments with fixed quantized circulation .",
    "the length of these filaments is macroscopic ( they can be as long as the experimental cell ) but the thickness of the vortex core is microscopic ( about @xmath0 cm in liquid helium ii ) . in 3d superfluid turbulence is manifested as a disordered tangle of vortex filaments . in 2d disordered motion of the vortices is a sign of turbulence . indeed",
    ", many remarkable similarities between classical turbulence and superfluid turbulence have been noticed .",
    "for example the classical @xmath1 kolmogorov energy spectrum ( where k is the wavenumber ) was observed in helium ii when agitated by rotating propellers @xcite .",
    "the same spectrum was apparent in the numerical simulations of nore et al @xcite and of tsubota and collaborators @xcite .",
    "another example is the classical @xmath2 temporal decay of turbulence ( where t is time ) which was measured in helium ii behind a towed grid @xcite    in atomic bose - einstein condensates , it has been suggested that turbulence can be created by combining rotations about two axes @xcite .",
    "decay of superfluid turbulence due to the interactions of vortices with rarefaction solitary waves was investigated by @xcite . the decay and forced 2d turbulent flow @xcite was also described with numerical simulations .",
    "large scale turbulence of quantized vortices was studied in superfluid @xmath3he - b and @xmath4he .",
    "the disadvantage of atomic bose - einstein condensate is that with existing techniques , condensates are rather small and contain at the most some hundreds vortices . on the other hand good visualization of individual vortices",
    "is possible .",
    "an interesting problem to study is the transformation of kinetic energy into acustic energy @xcite arising from vortex reconnections @xcite and vortex acceleration @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show that the phase imprinting method @xcite can be used to study the formation of rotating turbulence accompanied by acoustic emissions in a simple 2-dimensional condensate .",
    "to explore the density and phase profile of a rotating condensate , we solve numerically the following two - dimensional gross - pitaevskii equation which governs the time evolution of the complex order parameter @xmath5 : + @xmath6\\psi , \\label{eqn : gp}\\ ] ] where the coupling constant is @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the atomic mass and @xmath9 is the scattering length . the chemical potential , @xmath10 , which can be initially estimated in dimensional form as :    @xmath11    from the thomas - fermi solution @xcite of eq .",
    "[ eqn : gp ] , is found by the single - step integration :    @xmath12    after the initial thomas - fermi solution has relaxed to a time - independent solution in the harmonic trap , where @xmath13 denotes spatial average .",
    "the trapping potential is    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the radial trap frequency .",
    "the quantity @xmath16 is the angular frequency of rotation about the z - axis and @xmath17 = @xmath18 is the angular momentum operator .    in order to perform our analysis",
    ", we introduce the density and the velocity : @xmath19 and @xmath20 and decompose the total energy , @xmath21 , in the following way :    @xmath22    where the kinetic energy , @xmath23 , the internal energy , @xmath24 , the quantum energy , @xmath25 , and the trap energy , @xmath26 , are given respectively by    @xmath27    @xmath28    @xmath29    @xmath30    furthermore , we decompose the kinetic energy , @xmath23 , into a part due to the sound field , @xmath31 , and a part due to vortices , @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "@xmath33    at a given time t , the vortex energy , @xmath32 , is obtained by relaxing the gross - pitaevskii equation in imaginary time , which yields the lowest energy state for a given vortex configuration @xcite .",
    "the sound energy is then recovered from @xmath34 .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite the gross - pitaevskii equation in dimensionless form in terms of the harmonic oscillator energy @xmath35 , the harmonic oscillator length @xmath36 and the harmonic oscillator time @xmath37 .",
    "we obtain :    @xmath38\\psi , \\label{eqn:2d_gpe}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath39    @xmath40    n is the number of atoms and l the extension of the condensate in the z - direction . unless stated otherwise , we set @xmath41 = 1400 in our calculations . in dimensionless units the initial estimate for @xmath10 is @xmath42 .",
    "the dimensionless form of the energy contributors are :    @xmath43    @xmath44    @xmath45    and    @xmath30    the calculation is performed in a square box of size d. we choose d so that it is larger than the trapped condensate , and impose boundary conditions @xmath46 = 0 at @xmath47 = @xmath48 , @xmath49 = @xmath48 .",
    "typically , d = 10 .",
    "the time stepping is a semi - implicit the crank - nicholson algorithm .",
    "following @xcite , starting from a non - rotating condensate at time t = 0 , we set @xmath16 = 0.85 and create a stable lattice of 20 vortices in a rotating frame .",
    "this state mimics the solid body rotation of a rotating classical euler fluid .",
    "the relaxation of the vortex system into a stable lattice is helped by the addition of a tiny dissipative term , @xmath50 , with @xmath51 @xmath52 1 at the left hand side of eq .",
    "[ eqn : gp ] and eq .",
    "[ eqn:2d_gpe ] , as described by @xcite ; this term models the interaction of the condensate with the surrounding thermal cloud at finite temperatures as described by @xcite . density and phase profiles of the condensate",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] . at t = 200",
    ", we suddenly perform the following phase imprinting :    @xmath53    @xmath54    for a large system with many vortices ( as our system ) , the phase imprinting denotes that about half of quantized vortices change their sense of rotation .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] shows the condensate just after the phase imprinting . note that , the original condensate is divided into four equal parts , two parts rotating clockwise and two anticlockwise .",
    "this implies that the kinetic energy of the system is suddenly lowered .",
    "hereafter , we shall consider the contributions to the energy for @xmath55 , after the phase imprinting .",
    "after the phase imprinting , positive and negative vortices interact and move due the velocity field which they induce on each other .",
    "[ fig : f3 ] shows phase profiles at t = 200.65 and t = 200.9 .",
    "[ fig : f4 ] shows density and phase profiles at t = 201.95 .",
    "[ fig : f4]a reveals that large density oscillations ( sound waves ) are present in the condensate .    due to the confined and finite size of the condensate , the sound waves are reflected from the edge of the condensate and reinteract with the vortex pairs .",
    "we can see that when @xmath31 is approaching its maximum , @xmath32 is approaching its minimum , see fig .",
    "[ fig : f5 ] .",
    "the interaction of positive and negative vortices leads to a disordered motion of the vortices .",
    "the trajectories of the vortices can be obtained by tracking the phase profiles in time . for clarity",
    ", we show vortex trajectories of two vortices at the time in fig .",
    "[ fig : f6 ] , fig .",
    "[ fig : f7 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : f8 ] .",
    "[ fig : f9 ] shows all these trajectories together .",
    "our calculation shows that the method which we suggest can be used to create a system of positive and negative vortices in a disk - shaped condensate and that the vortices will move in irregular way under each other s influence .",
    "the method can thus be used to create a two - dimensional turbulent system , similar to the classical onsager vortex gas @xcite .",
    "clearly , a disk - shaped condensate created in the laboratory is a three - dimensional system , but , provided that , the thickness of the disk is only few times the coherence length , the resulting turbulence will be sufficiently two - dimensional , because kelvin waves will not be able to propagate along vortices in the z - direction .",
    "it is useful to distinguish two possible evolutions after the phase imprinting :    ( i ) : @xmath16 and @xmath51 are kept the same . after a transient turbulent state , the system will relax to the original vortex lattice as in fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] ( essentialy repeating the original calculation but starting from a different initial condition ) .",
    "negative vortices will move to the edge of the condensate and vanish , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f10 ] .",
    "( ii ) : @xmath16 is set to zero together with the dissipation , @xmath51 .",
    "if @xmath56 , the system ought to eventually relax to the ground state with no vortices .",
    "if @xmath57 , the negative vortices remain in the condensate , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : f11 ] .",
    "it is instructive to compare the number of total , negative and positive vortices in these two cases ( @xmath16 and @xmath51 kept the same and @xmath16 and @xmath51 set to zero ) for the same interval of time , between @xmath58 and @xmath59 . we conclude , that in the case of ( i ) , the negative vortices disappear quickly , but in the case of ( ii ) , for that short time , the negative vortices stay in the condensate and the transient turbulent state lasts much longer . over a much longer time scale",
    ", we expect that the condensate will become vortex - free , due to collisions and mutual annihilation of vortices with anti vortices .",
    "there are many possible variations of the method .",
    "for example , we can obtain positive and negative vortices by setting : @xmath60 for @xmath61 and @xmath62 for @xmath63 ( where the star denotes the complex conjugate ) .",
    "if we set : @xmath60 for @xmath61 and @xmath64 for @xmath65 a dark soliton - like disturbance @xcite is created along the x - axis . in a two - dimensional system",
    "this structure is unstable to the snake instability @xcite and vortex - anti vortex pairs ( or vortex rings in three dimensions @xcite are created .",
