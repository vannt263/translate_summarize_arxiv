    "<S> the latter follows since there are no current - carrying states for @xmath15 at @xmath117 . moreover , since ed and aaa already suggest that @xmath85 as @xmath90 , limitations in the accessible simulation times confine the tdmrg to an analysis of @xmath118 . to induce a current we add a perturbation @xmath119 to eq .  </S>",

    "<S> @xmath123 follows @xmath125 qualitatively , with additional @xmath126-oscillations from the underlying luttinger liquid . </S>",
    "<S> we perform the time evolution using @xmath127 states for the ground - state calculation , a time step of @xmath128 , and a fixed discarded weight @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although @xmath129 breaks @xmath130 symmetry , we can still obtain reliable results for @xmath131 lattice sites . to analyze currents free of spatial oscillations we coarse - grain the data by averaging over suitable parts of the chain . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : rtcurrents ]  ( b ) shows an example of the time evolution of the current @xmath132 , averaged over the left half of the chain , at @xmath124 for @xmath113 . for the times reached in the simulation ( @xmath133 ) , no relaxation can be observed . </S>",

    "<S> the frequency shifts match each other almost exactly , while we attribute the slight deviation of ed from tdmrg at larger fields to finite temperature effects , where convergence to the @xmath117 values has not been reached yet [ see @xmath106 in fig .  </S>",
