    "bl lacertae objects ( bl lacs ) are members of the blazar class of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "blazars exhibit rapid , large amplitude variability at all wavelengths , high optical and radio polarization , apparent superluminal motion , and in some cases , gamma - ray emission .",
    "all of these observational properties lead to the broadly held belief that blazars are agn with jets oriented nearly along our line of sight .",
    "the broadband spectral energy distribution of blazars , when plotted as @xmath8f@xmath9 versus frequency , shows a double peaked shape , with a smooth extension from radio to between ir and x - ray frequencies ( depending on the specific blazar type ) , followed by a distribution that typically starts in the x - ray band and can peak in the gamma - ray band , at energies as high as several hundred gev .",
    "the low energy part is believed to be incoherent synchrotron radiation from a relativistic electron - positron plasma in the blazar jet .",
    "the origin of the high energy emission is still a matter of considerable debate ( e.g. , buckley 1998 ; mannheim 1998 ) .",
    "markarian 501 ( mrk 501 ) is one of the closest bl lacs ( @xmath10 ) known and it is one of the brightest in the x - ray band . because its peak spectral power output occurs at uv / x - ray energies , mrk 501 is classified as a high frequency peaked bl lac .",
    "it is one of only six bl lacs reported as sources of very high energy ( vhe , e @xmath11 250 gev ) gamma rays and , along with mrk 421 , one of only two that have been confirmed as vhe sources ( for a review , see catanese & weekes 1999 ) .",
    "mrk 501 has also been detected as a source of gamma rays at gev energies with the energy gamma - ray experiment telescope ( egret ; kataoka et al .",
    "1999 ) and at a few hundred kev by the oriented scintillation spectrometer experiment ( osse ; catanese et al .",
    "1997 ) on the _ compton gamma - ray observatory_.    just as all other blazars , mrk 501 exhibits rapid , large amplitude variability over a wide range of wavelengths . in x - rays , variations of from 30% to 300% were observed on time scales of days in 1997 during a high emission state @xcite but no sub - day scale flares were seen .",
    "the fastest variation observed in x - rays was a flux increase of approximately 20% in about 12 hours seen with exosat in 1986 @xcite .",
    "spectral variability in x - rays from mrk 501 has been both moderate , with changes in the spectral index of @xmath00.1 - 0.3 on several day scales ( e.g. , pian et al .",
    "1998 ) , and rapid , with spectral variations of @xmath00.5 on 2 - 3 day time - scales , observed in 1998 june @xcite . the whipple observatory has observed vhe gamma - ray variations spanning a factor of @xmath1170 in flux in four years of observations and has observed significant variability with time - scales as short as 2 hours @xcite .",
    "similar variability ranges are observed by other vhe telescopes @xcite . in the r - band , @xcite reported the detection of a flare in which the flux increased by 4% ( from @xmath12 to 13.80 ) in 15 minutes with a decay to the previous level in the same amount of time .",
    "multi - wavelength observations have revealed correlations between vhe gamma rays and x - rays in this object @xcite and in 1997 , the synchrotron spectrum of mrk 501 was observed to extend up to approximately 100 kev @xcite , the highest seen in any blazar and a 50-fold increase over what was observed only one year before @xcite .",
    "this behavior has established mrk 501 as the prototype for a subset of bl lacs that exhibit large shifts in the peak of their synchrotron spectra during flares .    in this paper , we report on observations of mrk 501 taken with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) in 1998 may as part of a multi - wavelength campaign .",
    "the full multi - wavelength results will be reported in a future work . here",
    ", we concentrate on the observation of a very rapid flare and discuss its implications .",
    "_ rxte _ consists of the proportional counter array ( pca ; jahoda et al .",
    "1996 ) which is sensitive to 2 - 60 kev photons , the high energy x - ray transient experiment ( hexte ; rothschild et al .",
    "1998 ) which is sensitive to 15 - 150 kev photons , and the all - sky monitor ( asm ; levine et al . 1996 ) which is sensitive to 2 - 12 kev photons . here",
    "we report on the results of the pca observations .",
    "the count rate for hexte was too low to obtain significant count rate variations on the time scales observed .",
    "there are no observations with the asm during the period of the flare . also , because the x - ray flare occurred at approximately 18 hours universal coordinated time ( utc ) , there are no overlapping tev observations from whipple , hegra , cat , or the telescope array .    the observations of mrk 501 occurred between 1998 may 15 and 29 .",
    "they consisted of roughly four 2 - 3 ks pointings per day for the full two weeks .",
    "after screening for good time intervals , as described below , the data set consists of 114 ks of observations .",
    "each observation resulted in a very significant detection of mrk 501 that allowed spectra to be resolved and short - term variability to be investigated .",
    "we used ftools v4.2 to analyze this data .",
    "the background was estimated using the weak source background models ( appropriate for sources with count rates @xmath140 counts / s / pcu ) and the latest response matrices obtained from the _ rxte _ guest observer facility ( gof ) web site.1st.html ] good time intervals were selected from the standard 2 data files using the screening criteria recommended by the _ rxte _",
    "finally , only proportional counter units ( pcus ) 0 , 1 , and 2 were active for the vast majority of the observations presented here , so we only use those pcus in this work .",
    "for spectra and all other light curves , we used all three layers .",
    "spectral fits were performed using xspec 10.0 .",
    "we use the galactic hydrogen column density of @xmath13 @xmath6 @xcite to model the effect of photoelectric absorption , which is negligible for the energy range covered by the pca for this object located far from the galactic plane .",
    "the 2 - 10 kev lightcurve for the 1998 may observations is shown in figure  [ 1998_lc ] .",
    "the data points are shown in 1024-second bins .",
    "the count rate varies by approximately a factor of 1.8 from 21 cts / s to 38 cts / s . by comparison ,",
    "_ rxte _ observations of mrk 501 in 1997 april exhibited 2 - 10 kev lightcurve count rates of 80 cts / s to 160 cts / s @xcite .",
    "thus , mrk 501 was in a much lower emission state during these observations than in 1997 , though the flux was relatively high by historical standards .",
    "the light curve begins with a 20% drop over two days , follows with a 50% rise over three days , and ends with a gradual decline in flux of 65% over the remaining nine days of the observation . during the decline , small amplitude ,",
    "day - scale flares are evident at mjd 50955 and 50960 .",
    "most notably , toward the end of mjd 50958 ( indicated by the two vertical lines in fig .",
    "[ 1998_lc ] ) , the flux is much higher than the surrounding observations , and is actually the highest count rate in this light curve . for the remainder of the paper we concentrate on this flare observation .",
    "detailed analysis of the entire 1998 data set will be presented in a future paper .",
    "this flare occurs during what is otherwise a somewhat unremarkable observation period .",
    "there is no evidence of significant short term variability within any other single observation nor is the variability seen on day scales in the other observations of such large amplitude .",
    "the largest variation on any other day is a 30% increase of the flux between mjd 50951 and 50952 .",
    "our comparisons of background files with the pca background model and investigations of the data quality monitors ( e.g. , electron activation ) confirm that this flare is not a spurious effect .    in figure  [ flare_lc ] , we show the 2 - 10 kev and 10 - 15 kev light curves for the observation indicated by the vertical lines in figure  [ 1998_lc ] . the observation was taken on may 25 between 17.9 and 18.6 hours universal coordinated time ( utc ) .",
    "the data are shown in 96-second bins . during this observation ,",
    "mrk 501 exhibited low flux , very steady emission for about half of the observation .",
    "after this , the count rate increased from approximately 26 cts / s to 41 cts / s in approximately 200 seconds , corresponding to a brightness increase of 13%/minute .",
    "this is followed by a steady decrease in the count rate to approximately 30 cts / s in approximately 580 seconds , a decline rate of 3%/minute .",
    "though not quite as well measured due to lower statistics , the flare is clearly evident in the 10 - 15 kev light curve , with a similar rise and fall time - scale .",
    "the 10 - 15 kev flux variation rate is 18%/minute and 3%/minute for the rise and fall of the flare , respectively .",
    "observations were also taken with _ rxte _",
    "approximately 5.5 hours before and 5.5 hours after this observation .",
    "neither showed any significant variability .",
    "the observation before the flare had an average 2 - 10 kev count rate of 24.5 cts / s and the one after the flare had an average count rate of 27 cts / s .",
    "both are consistent with little or no change in flux compared to that seen at the start and end of the flare observation .",
    "the average spectrum for the observations between may 15 and 29 is best fit by a broken power law model with a photon spectral index of 1.92@xmath20.01 up to a break at 6.2@xmath20.3 kev , above which the spectral index is 2.07@xmath20.01 .",
    "the 2 - 10 kev flux during this period is @xmath14 erg @xmath6 s@xmath7 .",
    "the spectrum extends to at least 40 kev with no evidence of another break .",
    "this spectrum connects smoothly with osse measurements during this period @xcite .",
    "observations taken with _ beppo sax _ on april 28 and 29 and may 1 @xcite indicate a somewhat harder spectrum with peak power output at @xmath020 kev .",
    "the x - ray flux during the _ beppo sax _",
    "observation is @xmath1550% higher than in the _ rxte _ observations reported here , so the spectral shift is consistent with the previously observed tendency of mrk 501 to increase the energy at which the spectral energy distribution peaks as its flux increases ( e.g. , pian et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "spectral analysis of the flare observation reveals a rapid change during the course of the flare .",
    "we fit the spectrum from 3 - 15 kev where there are sufficient photon statistics and no problems with the pca response function .",
    "the average spectrum for the observation is well - fit by a simple power law with a photon spectral index of @xmath16 . to investigate the evolution of the spectrum during the course of the flare , we break up the data into three regions : before the flare , during the rise , and during the decay .",
    "all are well - fit by simple power laws and a summary of those fits is given in table  [ spec_fits ] .",
    "the photon spectral index is @xmath17 before the flare , @xmath18 during the rise of the flare , and @xmath19 during the decay of the flare .",
    "the spectrum during the flare follows this power law at least out to 30 kev , indicating a large shift in the location of the peak power output during the flare .",
    "dividing the decay of the flare into two parts does not reveal significantly different spectra than the average spectrum for the entire decay region .",
    "the observation taken approximately 5.5 hours before the flare indicates a spectral index of @xmath20 and a 2 - 10 kev flux of @xmath21 erg @xmath6 s@xmath7 , consistent with the observations just prior to the flare .",
    "the observation taken approximately 5.5 hours after the flare observation indicates a spectral index of @xmath22 and a 2 - 10 kev flux of @xmath23 erg @xmath6 s@xmath7 , indicating a significant softening of the spectrum following the flare .",
    "the variation in the spectral index during the course of the flare can provide insights into the dominant flaring timescales and acceleration process . as discussed by @xcite , for a flare in which the variability and acceleration time - scales are much less than the cooling time - scale a plot of the spectral index versus flux should follow a clockwise pattern , i.e. , the harder energies vary first . for a flare",
    "where the variability , acceleration , and cooling time - scales are similar , the spectral index versus flux diagram should move in a counter - clockwise direction , i.e. , the softer energies vary first because the number of particles changes due to the acceleration process which proceeds from low energy to high energy .",
    "clockwise patterns are most commonly observed in the tev sources mrk 421 ( e.g. , takahashi et al . 1996 ) and pks 2155 - 304 ( e.g. , kataoka et al . 2000 ) but counter - clockwise patterns have been recently observed from these objects @xcite .    because the data do not have sufficient statistics to plot spectral index versus flux on such short time scales , we instead plot the hardness ratio ( 10 - 15 kev count rate/2 - 10 kev count rate ) versus flux for the flare on may 25 in figure  [ hard_flux ] .",
    "the numbers in the plot indicate the development of the hardness ratio in time during the flare .",
    "the large cluster of filled circles represents the observations before the onset of the flare .",
    "the filled triangles represent the rising part of the flare . the point indicated by the tail of the arrow marked with",
    "the `` 1 '' is the last low flux point before the flare starts .",
    "the filled squares are data taken during the decay of the flare . during the rise of the flare , the hardness ratio increases steadily . during the decay of the flare",
    ", there is a slight trend for the hardness ratio to increase even further .",
    "thus , these observations are consistent with a counter - clockwise pattern .",
    "a clockwise pattern seems precluded by the significantly harder spectrum during the decay of the flare than the rise ( see table  [ spec_fits ] ) but other patterns in the hardness ratio versus flux diagram can not be ruled out given the statistical errors in this observation . the counter - clockwise pattern and the large shift in the synchrotron peak",
    "imply that the acceleration process dominates the development of the flare , accelerating a fresh population of high energy electrons which causes the flare .    in summary ,",
    "_ rxte _ observations of mrk 501 in 1998 may have revealed a flux state which was approximately one - fourth as strong as observed in 1997 , and an average spectrum with peak power output at approximately 6 kev .",
    "this is a decrease of more than a factor of 15 from the 100 kev peak seen in 1997 . during these observations",
    ", a very rapid flare was observed in which the location of peak power output increased from @xmath33 kev to @xmath2430 kev .",
    "this large shift in peak power output energy is similar to the behavior of mrk 501 in 1997 and in 1998 june .",
    "the evolution of the hardness ratio of the flare is consistent with the flare development being dominated by the acceleration process but the lack of simultaneous multi - wavelength observations prohibits further detailed testing of emission models .",
    "though rapid variations have been seen from mrk 501 at other wavelengths before , it was generally regarded as a more slowly varying object than the other tev sources , mrk 421 and pks 2155 - 304 .",
    "thus , one could conduct less dense observations of mrk 501 and still sample the variations with adequate coverage to resolve the shape of the variations and the correlations between wavelengths .",
    "these observations show that very dense multi - wavelength observations are required for mrk 501 as well since it can vary on time - scales comparable to the fastest seen in the other tev sources .",
    "they also indicate that , as has been seen in mrk 421 @xcite , these very rapid flares can occur when the source is not in a particularly high emission state , so dense observations must be used regardless of the flux level observed from these objects .",
    "multi - wavelength observations of such rapid flares will provide stringent tests of emission models for these tev sources and may lead to a better understanding of the acceleration process that occurs in their jets .",
