    "in 1985 patterson & raymond presented a simple and appealing picture of the x - ray emission of nonmagnetic cvs which for many has become the `` standard model '' ( patterson & raymond 1985a ; b ) .",
    "the essence of this model is embodied in figure 8 of patterson & raymond ( 1985a ) : ( 1 ) the x - ray emission is produced in the boundary layer between the accretion disk and the surface of the white dwarf ; ( 2 ) when the accretion rate @xmath0 onto the white dwarf is low ( e.g. , dwarf novae in quiescence ) , the boundary layer is optically thin and quite hot ; ( 3 ) when @xmath0 onto the white dwarf is high ( e.g. , novalike variables and dwarf novae in outburst ) , the boundary layer is optically thick and quite cool ; and ( 4 ) even when @xmath0 is high , there invariably will be a hot , optically thin `` atmosphere '' on the otherwise cool boundary layer . at one extreme , the boundary layer can be as hot as the virial temperature @xmath1 kev , and , at the other extreme , as cool as the blackbody temperature @xmath2  ev . the boundary layer luminosity is @xmath3 , where the factor @xmath4 accounts for the rotation of the white dwarf : @xmath5 ^ 2 $ ] , where @xmath6 is the rotation velocity and @xmath7 is the breakup velocity of the white dwarf .",
    "the boundary layer luminosity is reduced significantly only if @xmath8 or @xmath9 , whereas @xmath10 km @xmath11 for u  gem ( sion et  al .",
    "1994 ) , @xmath12 for vw  hyi ( sion et  al .",
    "1995 ) , and possibly @xmath13 for ss  cyg ( mauche 1997c ) .",
    "narayan & popham ( 1993 ) and popham & narayan ( 1995 ) have recently supplied more detailed theoretical treatments of the boundary layers of cvs . in high-@xmath0 systems ,",
    "popham & narayan distinguish between the `` dynamical boundary layer '' very near the surface of the white dwarf where the disk material switches from rotation to pressure support and the angular velocity deviates significantly from keplerian , and the much more extended `` thermal boundary layer '' where the boundary layer luminosity is radiated .",
    "the structure of the boundary layer and the resulting radiation spectrum depend on the mass - accretion rate and the white dwarf s mass and rotation velocity ; for @xmath14@xmath15 the peak effective temperatures are @xmath1630  ev , but this can be reduced further if @xmath17 .    to test these and other theoretical models of the boundary layers of cvs , we present and discuss below some of the observational aspects of the euv and x - ray emission of nonmagnetic cvs . for another recent review ,",
    "see verbunt ( 1996 ) .",
    "the physical location of the source of the x - ray emission in nonmagnetic cvs is constrained by ( 1 ) the variation of apparent emission measure with inclination ( van teeseling et  al .",
    "1996 ) , ( 2 ) the relative strength of the line and continuum spectrum reflected off the white dwarf and accretion disk ( e.g. , done & osborne 1997 ) , and ( 3 ) the x - ray light curves of eclipsing systems .",
    "all these constraints imply that all or most of the hard x - rays are emitted very close to the white dwarf , but the eclipse observations are the most direct and unambiguous . in z  cha ( @xmath18 ; van teeseling 1997a ) and ht  cas ( @xmath19 ; wood et  al .",
    "1995a ; mukai et  al .",
    "1997 ) in quiescence , the x - rays are fully eclipsed for @xmath20 , comparable to the length of the optical eclipse of the white dwarf . from the high - quality _ asca",
    "_ x - ray light curve of ht  cas ( fig .  1 )",
    ", the duration of the ingress / egress is measured to be @xmath21 , implying that the size of the x - ray emission region @xmath22 .",
    "in sharp contrast to the compact source of hard x - rays in low-@xmath0 systems , there is strong evidence for an extended source of euv / soft x - rays in high-@xmath0 systems . _",
    "exosat _ light curves of oy  car ( @xmath23 ) in superoutburst ( naylor et  al .",
    "1988 ) and _ rosat _ light curves of the novalike variable ux  uma ( @xmath24 ; wood et  al.1995b ) rule out an eclipse by the secondary of a compact source of x - rays centered on the white dwarf . in both cases ,",
    "it is argued that the boundary layer is obscured from view by the accretion disk at all orbital phases , and that the observed x - rays come from a corona or wind above the disk .",
    "the situation is far more complex in u  gem ( @xmath25 ) . in quiescence , the hard x - rays",
    "are partially eclipsed at orbital phase @xmath26 ( szkody et  al .",
    "1996 ) , and during outburst the euv / soft x - rays are partially eclipsed at orbital phases @xmath27 and 0.1 ( mason et  al.1988 ; long et  al .",
    "these dips in the and euv light curves are interpreted as due to partial eclipses of the boundary layer by vertical structure at the edge of the accretion disk ( @xmath28  cm ) or at the circularization radius of the accretion stream ( @xmath29  cm ) ; in either case , the heights above the orbital plane are distressingly large : @xmath30 , whereas the disk thickness @xmath31 .",
    "the _ euve _",
    "spectra of u  gem in outburst supply additional diagnostic information .",
    "the phase - averaged spectrum is a melange of ne vi ",
    "viii , mg vi  vii , and fe vii  x emission lines superposed on a @xmath32  ev blackbody continuum ( long et  al .",
    "the phase - resolved spectra demonstrate that the eclipses affect the continuum more strongly than the lines ( most strikingly , the ne  viii @xmath33 line is nearly unaffected by the eclipses ; see mauche 1997b ) , implying that the lines are produced in a region of larger extent than that of the continuum , which presumably is formed in the boundary layer .    to further investigate the nature of the euv / soft x - ray flux of oy  car",
    ", we recently obtained _ euve _ spectra (  4 ) and light curves of this dwarf nova in superoutburst .",
    "the observations were continuous for an interval of @xmath34 days near the beginning of the outburst , but useful data is obtained by _",
    "euve _ for only @xmath35 min of every 94.9 min satellite orbit . given the 90.9 min orbital period of oy  car , the binary phases advance by only 4% per satellite orbit ,",
    "so data near the eclipse of the white dwarf is obtained for only 78 continuous orbits every @xmath36 hrs . nevertheless , the larger number of eclipses observed ( 13 vs.  2 ) and the higher count rate ( 0.8 vs.  @xmath37 ) lead to a significant improvement over the previous _ exosat _ observations . typical",
    "_ euve _ deep survey ( ds ) light curves of oy  car are shown in figure  2 .",
    "as during the _ exosat _ observations , no eclipses are observed in any of the _ euve _ light curves , implying that the euv emission region is significantly extended : the size of the emission region must be larger than that of the secondary ( @xmath38  cm ) and at least comparable to the size of the binary ( @xmath39  cm ) .",
    "as is well known , cvs manifest a variety of rapid periodic and aperiodic oscillations in their optical and x - ray flux ( warner 1995 ) .",
    "the so - called `` dwarf nova oscillations '' ( dnos ; patterson 1981 ) of high-@xmath0 cvs have high coherence ( @xmath40@xmath41 ) , periods of @xmath4230  s , amplitudes of @xmath4230% in soft x - rays and @xmath43% in the optical , and are sinusoidal to high accuracy .",
    "x - ray dnos have been best studied in ss  cyg ( crdova et  al .  1980 ; 1984 ; jones & watson 1992 ) , u  gem ( crdova et  al .",
    "1984 ; mason et  al .  1988 ; long et  al .  1996 ) , and vw  hyi ( van der woerd et  al .  1987 ) . of these ,",
    "the dnos of ss  cyg have been studied most extensively , thanks to numerous _",
    "heao-1 _ , _ exosat _ , and _ euve _ pointings of this dwarf nova in outburst .",
    "a strong anti - correlation between the oscillation period and the euv luminosity ( hence , by inference , @xmath0 onto the white dwarf ) has been discovered ( mauche 1996a ) , the euv spectrum of the oscillations has been measured ( mauche 1997a ) , and stringent limits have been placed on the amount of power in higher and lower harmonics of the fundamental ( mauche 1997c ) . recently , a new and surprising property of the x - ray dnos of ss  cyg has been discovered .",
    "ss  cyg was observed in outburst in 1996 october and december by _ euve _ and _ rosat _ , respectively .",
    "the optical and euv light curves of the short asymmetric 1996 october outburst are shown in the top panel of figure  3 .",
    "the figure demonstrates the well - known lag on the rise to dwarf nova outbursts between the optical and shorter wavelength flux ( for additional information , see mauche & mattei 1997 ) .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  3 shows the evolution with time of the period of the euv oscillation . during the rise to outburst",
    ", the period of the oscillation fell from 7.8  s to 6.6  s , jumped _ discontinuously _ ( `` tunneled '' ) to 2.90  s , and then fell to 2.85  s over an interval of 4.8  hr before observations with the _ euve _ ds were terminated .",
    "when observations with the ds instrument resumed on the decline from outburst , the period was 6.7  s and rose to 8.2  s over an interval of 2.1 days . during the _ rosat _ observations of the plateau phase of the subsequent long asymmetric 1996 december outburst ,",
    "the period of the oscillation was observed to rise from 2.80  s to 2.92  s over an interval of 4.2 days ( van teeseling 1997b ) .",
    "these observations set two precedents for dno research : ( 1 ) periods below 7  s and ( 2 ) period doubling .",
    "while period doubling has never been observed before in the optical or x - ray wavebands , its `` seeds '' may have been observed in _ euve _",
    "observations of the long asymmetric 1994 june / july outburst of ss  cyg ( mauche 1997c ) . during the optical plateau phase of the outburst , the amplitude of the first harmonic relative to the fundamental was 11% , whereas during the peak of the outburst , it was 30% .",
    "perhaps at even higher euv luminosities ( hence , by inference , higher @xmath0 onto the white dwarf ) , the power switches entirely into the first harmonic . that the @xmath44  s period is the first harmonic of the @xmath45  s fundamental is suggested by the smooth extrapolation of oscillation period with time shown in the lower panel of figure  3",
    "however , it is also possible to consider the @xmath44  s period the fundamental and the @xmath45  s period the first subharmonic . the keplerian period at the surface of the white dwarf in ss  cyg is @xmath46  s. for the keplerian period to equal the observed minimum period of 2.80  s",
    ", the mass of the white dwarf must be @xmath47 .",
    "it would be very useful to firmly confirm or exclude this value by independent means .",
    "furthermore , it would be helpful to have data on the upward _ and _ downward transitions of the period doubling , to obtain simultaneous optical and/or uv data , and to determine if this behavior is manifested by other dwarf novae . an important question to consider",
    "is whether period doubling has never been observed in the optical simply because the typical integration times were too long .",
    "many of the spectroscopic aspects of the x - ray emission of nonmagnetic cvs are discussed by mauche ( 1997b ) and consequently will not be reproduced here .",
    "we limit the discussion here to ( 1 ) the low boundary layer luminosities of high-@xmath0 systems , ( 2 ) the unique nature of the euv / soft x - ray emission of ss  cyg , and ( 3 ) the euv spectrum of oy  car .",
    "one of the basic predictions of theoretical models of ( thin ) disk accretion onto a central object is that the ratio of the boundary layer to accretion disk luminosity is of order unity unless the central object is rotating near breakup . from  1 , the ratio @xmath48 ^ 2\\equiv \\zeta $ ] .",
    "from the inferred white dwarf rotation rates , @xmath49 for u  gem , @xmath50 for ss  cyg , and @xmath51 for vw  hyi ( mauche 1997c ) . in sharp contrast ,",
    "@xmath52 for u  gem ( long et  al .",
    "1996 ) , @xmath53 for ss  cyg ( mauche et  al .",
    "1995 ) , and @xmath54 for vw  hyi ( mauche et  al .  1991",
    "; mauche 1996b ) . while we must acknowledge that our understanding of the intrinsic spectral energy distribution of the accretion disk _ and _ boundary layer is far from certain ( and hence the assumed bolometric corrections are far from certain ) , it becomes increasingly clear that the boundary layer luminosities of high-@xmath0 cvs often fall far short of the values predicted by simple theory .",
    "while this result is seized on with relief by wind modelers ( e.g. , drew 1997 ) , it remains for boundary layer modelers a serious unsolved theoretical problem .",
    "another apparent discrepancy between theory and observations is the effective temperature of the boundary layer .",
    "theory predicts @xmath5530 ev (  1 ) , but among the many high-@xmath0 nonmagnetic cvs detected during the _ rosat _ all - sky survey ( beuermann & thomas 1993 ; verbunt et  al .",
    "1997 ) , only ss  cyg in outburst displayed such a soft spectral component .",
    "the boundary layer of u  gem is too soft ( @xmath32 ev ; long et  al .",
    "1996 ) and that of vw  hyi is too dim and too soft ( @xmath56 ev ; mauche et  al.1991 ; mauche 1996b ) to be detected by _",
    "rosat_. recklessly assuming that the other high-@xmath0 nonmagnetic cvs suffer from similar inadequacies , ss  cyg in outburst stands out as unique in manifesting a relatively hard ( @xmath5730 ev ; mauche et  al .  1995 ; ponman et  al .",
    "1995 ) soft x - ray spectral component .    in  2 we argued that the absence of eclipses in the _ exosat _ and _ euve _ light curves of oy  car in superoutburst evidence an extended and hence optically thin euv / soft x - ray emission region .",
    "that this region is indeed optically thin is demonstrated by the euv spectrum accumulated during the _ euve _ observations ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "superposed on a very weak continuum are emission lines of such species as o  v  vi , ne  v  vi , mg  iv  vi , and fe  vi  x ; species which dominate in collisionally ionized gas at @xmath58@xmath59  k. of the existing _ euve _ spectra of high-@xmath0 cvs , this spectrum looks most like that of u  gem in outburst ( long et  al .  1996 ; mauche 1997b ) , but it has a significantly weaker and , with no flux shortward of @xmath60   , cooler continuum . that the emission line region of oy  car is also cooler than that of u  gem is indicated by the absence of the ne  vii @xmath61 and ne  viii @xmath62 emission lines prominent in the euv spectrum of u  gem .",
    "a mewe et  al .",
    "( 1985 ) coronal model does a very poor job of reproducing the observed spectrum , but without additional work it can not be completely excluded that the poor match is due simply to incomplete atomic data . a much better match",
    "is made with a model using the verner et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) list of permitted resonance lines .",
    "if these preliminary conclusions survive detailed analysis , they argue that resonant scattering of the boundary layer continuum and not thermal emission from a shocked wind is the cause of the observed euv flux of oy  car ( raymond & mauche 1991 ) .",
