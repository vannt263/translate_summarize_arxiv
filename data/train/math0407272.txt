    "we will use the function @xmath293 defined by @xmath294this real function is continuous and strictly increasing .",
    "the inverse function @xmath295 is given by @xmath296and is also continuous and strictly increasing .",
    "let @xmath90\\in\\mathbb{h}_{f\\!t}(x)$ ] .",
    "consider the function @xmath297 defined by@xmath298 it is easy to see that the function @xmath299 is bounded from below . indeed , since the value of the metric @xmath300 is always nonnegative and the fraction in ( [ fhi ] ) is greater than -1 we have @xmath301 .",
    "then , we can define @xmath302 first we will show that the function @xmath216 is continuous on @xmath0 . from the triangular inequality of the metric @xmath300 for every @xmath303 we have@xmath304 therefore@xmath305 taking the infimum on @xmath306 we obtain @xmath307 hence we have the inequality@xmath308 which implies that the function @xmath216 is continuous on @xmath0 .",
    "our second step is to prove that @xmath216  satisfies the inequalities@xmath309 for every @xmath35 we have @xmath310 furthermore , since @xmath311 is a lower bound of @xmath312 the inequality @xmath313 also holds .",
    "it remains to prove that @xmath314 .",
    "let us assume that there exists @xmath35 such that @xmath315 .",
    "let the real number @xmath316 be such that @xmath317 .",
    "then we have@xmath318 due to the continuity of @xmath263 there exists @xmath319 such that @xmath320 moreover , since @xmath263 is strictly increasing we have @xmath321 using that the function @xmath322 is lower semi - continuous at @xmath31 , there exists @xmath139 such that @xmath323 hence @xmath324    let now @xmath325 .",
    "since @xmath326 is defined as an infimum on @xmath306 , there exists @xmath327 such that @xmath328 or , more precisely , @xmath329 using simple manipulations we obtain@xmath330    the contradiction between inequalities ( [ ineq17 ] ) , ( [ ineq18 ] ) on the one side and the condition ( [ ineq16 ] ) on the other side show that the assumption that @xmath315 for some @xmath35 is false .",
    "therefore @xmath331 @xmath35 .",
    "now we can consider the function@xmath332 due to inequalities ( [ ineq19 ] ) function @xmath333 is well defined for every @xmath35 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath333 is continuous on @xmath0 because @xmath216 is continuous on @xmath0 .",
    "using the fact that the function @xmath334 is strictly increasing on the interval @xmath335 from the middle inequality in ( ineq19 ) we obtain@xmath336 thus , @xmath333 is a continuous minorant of @xmath57 .",
    "the existence of a continuous majorant is proved in a similar way",

    "this paper addresses the issue of finding a characterization for the dedekind order completion of @xmath2 in a constructive form , namely , as a set of functions on the same space @xmath0 . here",
    "@xmath0 can be an arbitrary topological space .",
    "the functions , which give the completion , are the hausdorff continuous functions , and as such , are in general interval valued functions . however , they are not unlike the usual real - valued functions , since interval values only appear at points of discontinuity .",
    "the set @xmath1 of all finite hausdorff continuous functions is dedekind order complete and , thus , it contains the dedekind completion of @xmath2 .",
    "it was shown that in the important case of @xmath0 being a metric space @xmath1 is the dedekind order completion of @xmath2 . in the more general case of a completely regular topological space @xmath0 the dedekind order completion of @xmath22",
    "is the set @xmath26 of all h - continuous functions with a continuous majorant and a continuous minorant . in the case considered by dilworth @xcite , namely , the dedekind order completion of @xmath3 , where @xmath0 is a completely regular space , an alternative characterization of the dedekind order completion of @xmath3 was found in the form of the set @xmath24 - the set of all bounded hausdorff continuous functions .",
    "the hausdorff continuous functions can be applied in further improving recent mathematical methods in the solution of large classes on nonlinear partial differential equations , methods which use the dedekind order completion of @xmath2 , @xcite .",
    "let us note that the applicability of the set @xmath1 in the order completion method discussed in @xcite depends on the fact that , unlike the result in dilworth , there is no boundedness requirement on the functions .",
    "in addition to that , the hausdorff continuous functions provide a convenient representation of nonlinear shock waves .",
    "for instance , the function in example [ shock ] , as mentioned , is a solution of the inviscid burger s , or nonlinear shock wave equation , with a shock along the line @xmath338 .",
