    "current observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies indicate that primordial curvature perturbations are almost gaussian  @xcite . in general ,",
    "if the perturbations are purely gaussian , the statistical properties of the perturbations can be completely described by the two - point correlation function ( = power spectrum ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the perturbations deviate from the gaussian distribution , the non - gaussianity affects the higher order correlation functions , or higher order spectra .",
    "currently , the non - gaussianity is attracting attention as a powerful probe to discriminate various inflation models  @xcite .",
    "in particular , there are a large number of studies on the three - point correlation function ( = bi - spectrum ) .",

    "notice that observationally @xmath8 can be as large as @xmath12 .",
    "this possible enhancement slightly improves the detectability of the higher order correlation functions .",
    "furthermore , the number of argument wavenumbers of the @xmath1-point function is @xmath13 . when the cmb temperature anisotropies , @xmath14 , are measurable up to @xmath15 , the number of independent wavenumbers which we can measure will be roughly estimated as @xmath16 .",
    "hence , the number of different combinations of argument wavenumbers increases as @xmath17 .",
    "this large number enhances the effective amplitude of @xmath1-point function to @xmath18 , while the amplitude of gaussian noise is @xmath19 .",
    "the detectability of the @xmath1-point function is basically determined by the ratio of these two numbers , @xmath20 . hence ,",

    "that is , the number of parameters necessary to describe the higher order correlation functions is equal to the number of independent terms which have a different wavenumber dependence .",

    "such a connected diagram should have a tree structure .",

    "the final expression for the spectrum in appearance depends on which vertex we chose at the beginning , but , of course , all different looking expressions are equivalent .",
    "practically , it is more efficient to choose a vertex near the center so as to reduce the number of necessary vectors , although the definition of the center of a diagram is not so clear in many cases .      as we mentioned in sec .",
    "[ highersec ] , the _ reduced _ tree diagram is useful to classify the wavenumber dependence of the @xmath1-point functions , while the ( _ full _ ) tree diagram is a powerful tool for explicit computation of the @xmath1-point functions .",

    "[ highersec ] and proven in appendix  [ proof ] , the wavenumber dependence of the @xmath1-point functions is classified by the topology of the _ reduced _ tree diagram .",
    "this means that plural tree diagrams can give the contribution to @xmath1-point function with the same wavenumber dependence .    in fig .",

    "hence , we find that the formula for @xmath27 is composed of two different terms .    when we consider the statistical weight of the diagram , this correspondence between the _ reduced _ and _ full _ tree diagrams is important .",
    "the starting point is the fact that the statistical weight of each tree diagram is unity when each end point @xmath115 is labelled by the assigned momentum . therefore counting the statistical weight by writing down all different tree diagrams is straightforward .",
