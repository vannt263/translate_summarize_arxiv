    "the stability analysis of switched systems , a class of dynamical systems whose mathematical structure experiences abrupt changes , is one of the most fundamental problems in mathematical systems theory @xcite . in particular , the stability of positive switched systems , whose state variables are constrained to be in positive orthants , has received considerable attentions over the past decade  @xcite .",
    "the study of positive switched systems is motivated by their possible application in pharmacokinetics . in the modern treatment of human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) infection ,",
    "multiple drug regimens are employed to prevent the emergence of drug - resistant virus  @xcite .",
    "the authors in @xcite solve the minimization problem of such virus mutation by its reduction to the optimal control problem of a positive switched system under simplifying assumptions .",
    "the reduction was made possible by the switching nature of hiv treatments and the positivity constraint naturally placed on the population of virus .",
    "the importance of this class of switched systems also stems from the fact that such positivity constraints naturally arise in broad areas including communication systems  @xcite , formation flying  @xcite and multi agent systems  @xcite .",
    "the stability of positive switched linear systems has been mainly studied by co - positive lyapunov functions  @xcite .",
    "a co - positive lyapunov function is a non - negative linear form of state variables , which makes a contrast with general cases where the non - negativity of lyapunov functions forces us to use quadratic functionals of state variables .",
    "its linearity often reduces the stability analysis of positive switched linear systems to linear problems .",
    "for example , a positive switched linear system is stable for all switching signals if a family of square matrices associated with the given system consists of matrices whose eigenvalues have only negative real parts @xcite .",
    "however , once a switched system is modeled as a _ stochastic _",
    "switched system  @xcite , the above mentioned lyapunov function approach fails to take the probability distribution into account appropriately because it treats any sample path in a rather equal manner .",
    "one of the natural notions of stability in this case is mean stability @xcite , which requires that the norm of state variables converges to @xmath0 in expectation .",
    "one of the earliest results along this line is by feng et al .",
    "@xcite , where they give a necessary and sufficient condition for the exponential mean square stability of continuous - time markovian jump linear systems .",
    "this result has been extended to switched linear systems with various stochastic structures including switching markovian jump linear systems  @xcite , markovian jump linear systems with disturbances @xcite , and stochastic hybrid systems with renewal transitions @xcite .",
    "stochastic lyapunov function approaches for the stability analysis of markovian jump nonlinear systems with disturbances can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to give criteria for the mean stability of positive stochastic switched systems .",
    "we assume that the switched systems are semi - markovian jump linear systems @xcite ( also called stochastic hybrid systems with renewal transitions @xcite ) , whose switching signal is a markovian renewal process  @xcite .",
    "we show that their exponential mean stability is characterized by the spectral radius of a matrix that is easy to compute .",
    "we also allow their state to be reset @xcite by random linear mappings at the switching instances .",
    "one of the difficulties in analyzing semi - markovian jump linear systems is that its transition rate of discrete - modes is not time - invariant @xcite . instead of employing volterra integral equations used in @xcite",
    ", we avoid this difficulty by introducing a discretization of semi - markovian jump linear systems that admits a certain time - invariant expression ( proposition  [ proposition : diffeq ] ) .",
    "that discretization turns out to preserve stability properties and hence the system matrix of the discretization exactly determines the stability of the original system .",
