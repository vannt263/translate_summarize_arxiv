    "the basic equations governing the static realization of electrical power flow of electricity ( a version of the kirchhoff equations for currents and voltages ) express the vector of power consumption and generation as a quadratic form of the vector of voltages , where coefficients in the quadratic form are complex impedances of different edges of the grid @xcite .",
    "solutions of the power flow equations should additionally satisfy the set of operational constraints describing currents , voltages , phases and other graph - specific constraints .",
    "the so - called dc ( direct current ) approximation assumes that the resistivity - to - reactance ratio is small for any link , the voltage amplitudes are the same across the grid , and changes in the phase between neighboring nodes are sufficiently small .    within this dc approximation",
    "we seek the optimal distribution of generation that keeps the amount of load shed over the given network to minimum .",
    "we state this optimization in terms of the following linear programming ( lp ) , and computationally tractable , problem : @xmath0 @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the set of vertexes and edges , respectively , of the undirected power graph @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , @xmath6 stand for the subsets of generator and demand nodes , i.e. @xmath7 .",

    "these express respectively the flow conditions , dc conditions on phases , capacity conditions ( limits ) on powers flowing along the edges , generator capacity on the power the maximum amount of power the generators might be able to produce , and the natural conditions requiring that the positive amount of load shedding at any consumer node can not exceed the respective demand . note that inclusion of the dc conditions on the phases ( [ dc_cond ] ) makes the power grid flow optimization problem different from the standard lp formulation of the transportation flow optimization problem @xcite .",

    "different random initiations will sample the space of instantons , thus generating the so - called instanton spectrum describing the frequency of a given instanton occurrence and also suggesting an estimation for the ordered list ( with respect to their probability of occurrence and frequency ) of top instantons .",
    "repeated an infinite number of times , the sampling would output the most probable instanton .",
    "however given that the number of initiations will be finite , the most probable one ( of the finite number of instantons found ) gives an estimate from below for the probability of the most probable instanton .",
    "to ensure sampling quality in our simulations we continue random initiations till the most probable instantons would appear multiple number of times ( typically , this required hundreds of initiations ) .",

    "we do not do these more involved computations in this paper .",
    "however , we suggest that the frequency of a given instanton appearance within the instanton - amoeba procedure can be considered as a rough proxy for @xmath55 .",
    "let us briefly discuss some relations , but also differences , between our instanton approach and two important concepts in power engineering : first the available transfer capability ( atc ) , see e.g. @xcite , and second the probabilistic and stochastic optimal power flows ( opf ) @xcite .",
    "atc is normally defined as an available power transport reserve between two areas / regions connected by a link ( possibly aggregated link ) .",
    "to compute atc one increases flow through the link incrementally , introduce one ( or few ) degrees of freedom to adjust ( e.g. overall rescaling of the generation within a slack bus model of generation ) and test if the resulting power flow solver outputs solution free of capacity violations over the entire network considered .",
    "( in a more sophisticated version evaluation of atc may also account for @xmath62 contingencies , thus requiring that the resulting solutions do not violate capacity constraints even when any single element of the system is removed . ) as such atc also measures distance to failure , however in a different sense then the instanton technique .",
    "first of all , our instanton technique explores multi - dimensional variations ( in the space of demands ) while atc normally tests a single parametric changes ( in power flow along a single link ) .",
    "also , and more importantly , the instanton technique is inherently probabilistic , moreover focusing on predicting rare configurations resulting in a failure ( these taken place with probability significantly less than unity ) .",
    "on the contrary , even when atc is discussed in a stochastic setting ( for example assuming averaging over fluctuations of loads ) the fluctuations considered are typical , i.e. these realized with a reasonable , @xmath63 , probability .",
    "similarly , the concepts of probabilistic and stochastic opf , defined as a minimum cost generation optimized over spatial distribution of available generation and averaged over fluctuations ( for example over probability distribution of demands ) , accounts only for typical fluctuations .",
    "the opf is also similar to the @xmath20 scheme of eq .",

    "however any other and richer criteria ( for example one representing an ac flow optimization or another one checking for dynamic instability of the grid ) can be used as a substitute for @xmath20 in the elementary ( inner - loop ) step of the instanton scheme . in this regard",
    ", the instanton optimization scheme constitutes a black box capable of satisfying any sensible criterion .",
    "* on the other hand , the universality of the instanton - amoeba approach ( as the outerloop of the scheme ) can also be viewed as a handicap when it comes to discussing its complexity and implementation speed .",
    "thus , in the field of error - correction , a significantly faster instanton - search scheme , customized to the specific form of the inner - loop criterion ( lp - decoding , also the specific type of the channel statistics ) , was suggested in @xcite .",
    "this resulted in an essential acceleration of the instanton scheme relying heavily on the lp structure of the decoding .",
    "similarly , we anticipate that significant acceleration for the instanton search procedure exploring the lp structure of the load shedding formulation described above ( including faster instanton - search algorithm ) can be used to analyze a much larger networks , including aggregated models of the electric reliability council of texas ( ercot ) or even more ambitiously of the eastern grid and western grid of us . * the main point of the manuscript was to illustrate utility of the instanton - search approach in discovering weak points of the grid . to achieve this goal , while having access to only limited observational data , we have used some very model assumptions .",
    "in particular , we have assumed gaussian and moreover spatially uncorrelated statistics for distribution of demands , even though in reality the demands are highly correlated , in particular to external weather conditions .",
    "our instanton - amoeba scheme is highly universal , and as such allows straightforward modification to account for effects of load correlations in future studies . *",
    "the optimization problem we end up solving in the search for failures is not convex and the local search algorithm we employed gives only lower bound on the probability of the most probable failure mode .",
    "it will be important to improve this aspect of the search in the future providing techniques capable to upper bound the probability and thus giving absolute guarantees .",
    "we believe that such upper bounds guarantees can be achieved with the help of the  convexify - and - iterate \" approach of the type discussed in @xcite . *",
    "sparsity of the resulting instantons became an interesting outcome of our analysis .",
    "we have seen it persistently in the tests performed , and concluded that it is robust at least with respect to the change of demand distribution .",
    "an important problem left for future studies is to confirm or disprove the robustness in broader contexts such as over other grids ( graphs ) , other solvers ( e.g. ac instead of dc ) , more realistic models of the demand distribution ( e.g. taking into account correlations due to weather conditions and variability in fluctuations at different loads available via load forecast ) , other probabilistic models of fluctuations ( e.g. accounting for fluctuations in renewable generation ) , and other optimization techniques employed to discover the instantons .",
    "* many important aspects of power flow optimization , such as these related to optimal generator dispatch differentiating between the cost of production at different power plants , were not considered in the simplified load shedding model discussed in this manuscript . to account for variability in the cost of generation",
    "should be an interesting venue for future instanton analysis .",
    "* finally , this instanton - search technique can guide further exploration of more difficult statistical problems in power grid studies containing the @xmath20 , or any of its inner - loop optimization substitutes , as a sub - task .",
    "for example , we anticipate that some version of the instanton - search technique will be useful for resolving such important problems as interdiction over power networks @xcite , optimal switching of power lines to satisfy the aforementioned combinations of phase and capacity constraints @xcite , analysis of cascading power outages assuming sequential breakdown of saturated lines @xcite , and also developing a reduced description of the graph to help monitor grids under stress , e.g. complementing and extending the notion of cut - sets discussed in @xcite .",
    "we also expect that improved approaches will help to form a solid bridge to the macroscopic ( and so far largely phenomenological ) analysis of cascading power blackouts @xcite .",

    "<S> here we develop an approach to predict power grid weak points , and specifically to efficiently identify the most probable failure modes in static load distribution for a given power network . </S>",
    "<S> this approach is applied to two examples : guam s power system and also the ieee rts-96 system , both modeled within the static direct current power flow model . </S>",
    "<S> our algorithm is a power network adaption of the worst configuration heuristics , originally developed to study low probability events in physics and failures in error - correction . </S>",
    "<S> one finding is that , if the normal operational mode of the grid is sufficiently healthy , the failure modes , also called instantons , are sufficiently sparse , i.e. the failures are caused by load fluctuations at only a few buses . </S>",
    "<S> the technique is useful for discovering weak links which are saturated at the instantons . </S>",
    "<S> it can also identify generators working at the capacity and generators under capacity , thus providing predictive capability for improving the reliability of any power network .    </S>",
    "<S> power flow , rare events , distance to failure    the basic features of the electrical power grid have remained unchanged for over a hundred years . </S>",
    "<S> it is a hierarchical , centrally - controlled structure that assumes that power is generated solely from large central facilities , that power is abundant , and that power generation is relatively benign . </S>",
    "<S> reliability is attained through redundancies and highly controllable generation that reacts to problems such as demand fluctuations and outages , rather than anticipating and avoiding them . </S>",
    "<S> a number of significant recent developments have upended these assumptions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> demand has risen sharply and become more variable in recent decades adding significant stress to the grid . </S>",
    "<S> alternative renewable energy sources , including wind and solar , are being integrated into the power grid but their distributed and intermittent nature make them difficult to control . with the existing grid control mechanisms and the ongoing developments , </S>",
    "<S> the probability of the existing power grid to survive failures or attacks degrades significantly , emphasizing the need for new tools for power grid analysis .    </S>",
    "<S> normally , the operation of the grid keeps demand and load in balance and generators under their capacities . a power - flow solver , simulating the grid according to the kirchhoff laws and technological constraints @xcite , finds acceptable generation and transmission capacity to meet consumer demand in this satisfiable ( sat ) state constrained by the physical properties of the grid . in the power engineering literature this sat domain , including all the sat states , </S>",
    "<S> is usually called the feasibility region . starting from a sat state and perturbing it , for example by increasing loads </S>",
    "<S> , one typically arrives at another sat state . </S>",
    "<S> yet , there are marginal sat states , defining an error surface in the space of consumer demand , where such infinitesimal perturbations can push the grid into an unsatisfiable ( unsat ) state , where no feasible power - flow solution exists . </S>",
    "<S> standard term used in the power engineering literature for  the error surface \" is  the feasibility boundary \" . </S>",
    "<S> how do we determine which perturbations are the most dangerous and what regions of the grid must be shed for the grid to remain operational ? </S>",
    "<S> this paper addresses this difficult challenge systematically .    </S>",
    "<S> we built our approach on a methodology originated in physical applications , specifically the physics of disordered media @xcite , field theory @xcite and statistical hydrodynamics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the basic idea we borrow from these fields ( which generally deal with a huge space of configurations each weighted according known probabilities ) consists of relating the tail of a certain observable distribution function to a much smaller phase space , or in the extreme case of weak fluctuations to special instance(s)/configuration(s ) in the phase space - the instantons . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , the basic idea of dealing with a huge phase space of configurations ( each characterized by an assigned weight , probability or fitness ) is not unique to physics and can readily be extended to other disciplines . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the original theoretical approach suggests an algorithmic solution to the applied problem of  finding a needle in a haystack \" , i.e. not only estimating the tail of of a probability distribution function but more importantly , identifying those specific configurations that are part of the distribution function tail which can not be sampled or analyzed efficiently via brute force monte - carlo techniques . </S>",
    "<S> the  applied \" power of the instanton approach was recently utilized in the field of error - correction , where it was used to guide efficient searches for rare erroneous configurations that degrade the performance of decoding algorithms @xcite that are successful under normal circumstances . </S>",
    "<S> related algorithmic techniques were suggested for sampling rare trajectories in dynamical systems with nontrivial ( and often topologically nontrivial ) energy landscapes @xcite .    even though the instanton approach we suggest here is new to the field of power system modeling , the questions of accessing the distance to failure and probing rare but devastating events in power systems </S>",
    "<S> have been discussed many times in the past . </S>",
    "<S> the questions of the power grid reliability have received special attention recently as a result of large scale and cascading failures , such as the infamous 2003 east coast blackout @xcite . both microscopic @xcite and macroscopic @xcite models assessing the probability of blackout cascades </S>",
    "<S> were proposed and the results were compared with the electric power disturbance data . </S>",
    "<S> ( see also @xcite for a brief review of methods of cascading failure analysis . ) </S>",
    "<S> it was also argued @xcite that prevention , based on an instantaneous probing of the most probable failure mode from the current state estimate , may be the only cure against the blackouts in the future . </S>",
    "<S> the research reported in this paper , in spite of dealing with an instant failure and not a cascading failure , aims to achieve the larger goal of understanding and preventing cascading failures by identifying the error surface ( feasibility boundary ) between the normal and problematic regions of grid operation . in this </S>",
    "<S> regard , our approach complements other techniques , notably @xcite , developed to access static vulnerabilities and the distance to failure in power grids .    </S>",
    "<S> the remainder of the manuscript is organized as follows . in section [ sec : dc ] we introduce the directed current ( dc ) power flow model testing if the current state of the load is sat or unsat . </S>",
    "<S> section [ sec : distance ] describes our probabilistic distance to failure approach . </S>",
    "<S> it contains three subsections describing details of implementation section [ subsec : implementation ] , probabilistic interpretation section [ subsec : prob ] , and relation and differences between our scheme and other related techniques from power engineering section [ subsec : relations ] . </S>",
    "<S> section [ sec : sim ] discusses numerical tests of the instanton scheme . </S>",
    "<S> specifically we analyze two data sets of the island of guam and of the ieee rts-96 system in section [ subsec : guam ] and section [ subsec : rts-96 ] respectively . </S>",
