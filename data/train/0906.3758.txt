    "the fitting of global nucleon - nucleus optical model potentials ( omp ) for elastic scattering has a venerable history  @xcite .",
    "the global optical potential of this work ( wp omp ) was specifically designed with the next generation of radioactive beam accelerators in mind .",
    "it attempts to fit a lighter range of targets ( @xmath0 ) , including those far from stability , and it is over a limited projectile energy range ( 30 mev @xmath1 mev ) .",
    "this research has produced one continuous global isospin dependent omp which incorporates both proton and neutron scattering and real and imaginary isovector asymmetry terms .",
    "overall the potential of this work is recommended if one is interested in examining trends in the light and medium nuclei , specifically isospin asymmetry dependencies , shell closure , and neutron excess in isotopes .",
    "since the elastic potential is often used as a starting point in developing further inelastic results , this global optical potential will give the researcher a consistent formulation over a wide variety of nuclei from which to generate multichannel calculations . to promote its use",
    "we provide an on - line optical potential calculator  @xcite .",
    "recently there has been the development of two other modern global omps for nucleon - nucleus elastic scattering which cover an extensive projectile energy and target range : the potentials of koning and delaroche ( kd omp )  @xcite and madland ( md omp )  @xcite .",
    "specifically the potential of ref .",
    "@xcite has set an impressive benchmark for its extensive projectile energy range ( 1 kev to 200 mev ) and its accuracy of fit .",
    "we will make theoretical and calculatable comparisons of the new wp omp to these noteworthy potentials throughout this article .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] we briefly discuss the theory of the global optical potential .",
    "a summary of our theoretical fitting procedure and the experimental reactions constraining the fit follows in sec .",
    "[ sec : opt ] . a generous amount of example calculations , given in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , compare the results of this potential with the two other contemporary optical potentials .",
    "this is followed , in sec .",
    "[ sec : iso ] , by a detailed analysis of the isovector asymmetric term identifying dramatic differences in the magnitude and character of the isovector asymmetry @xmath2 term of the three global omps as well as with standard @xmath3 microscopic potentials . reactions are isolated which would better constrain the isovector term in the future .",
    "we end with concluding remarks and future directions .",
    "the theoretical and computational aspects of creating a global optical potential has been discussed in detail elsewhere , we only mention a few works which were found to be especially useful for this research . the seminal work of m.  a.  melkanoff et .",
    "@xcite discusses in thorough detail many of the hurdles that need to be overcome when attempting a computational fitting of nuclear scattering data .",
    "f.  d.  beccetti and g.  w.  greenless  @xcite created the first comprehensive and still viable global optical potential , we especially found poignant their discussion on weighting the various observables .",
    "recently a.  j.  koning and j.  p.  delaroche have provide the nuclear physics community with an ambitious optical model potential ( kd omp )  @xcite as previously mentioned .",
    "the work accompanying the kd omp was beneficial for its clear discussion of theoretical issues and its extensive and comprehensive tables of available experimental data .",
    "our complex phenemological optical model potential contains the traditional volume ( @xmath4 ) , surface ( @xmath5 ) , and spin - orbit ( @xmath6 ) nuclear terms which are delineated using the standard woods - saxon form factors @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the radius parameter and @xmath9 is the geometric diffusive parameter .",
    "the @xmath10 is a placeholder index for the @xmath4 ( volume ) , @xmath5 ( surface ) , and @xmath6 ( spin orbit ) designations .",
    "the phenemological optical model potential takes the standard form : @xmath11 where the @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the real and imaginary potential amplitudes respectively and @xmath14 is the coulomb term which has the following traditional format : @xmath15 for a neutron projectile this term is set to zero .",
    "the amplitudes , radii , and diffusive parameters have the following dependent variables : + @xmath16 * e *  projectile nucleon laboratory energy in mev + @xmath16 * a *  atomic number of the target nucleus + @xmath16 * n *  number of neutrons in the target nucleus + @xmath16 * z *  number of protons in the target nucleus + @xmath16 @xmath17  + 1 if projectile is a proton , -1 if a neutron + @xmath16 * mn *  set to 1 if the target is traditionally singly magic +  set to 2 if the target is traditionally doubly magic +  otherwise set to 0 .",
    "explicitly the thirteen woods - saxon terms of this omp are given using twenty - three distinct parameters where one woods - saxon potential term may have up to three of these parameters .",
    "the systematic polynomial formats of these terms are described below .",
    "the parameters are purposely labeled to emphasize that each was fitted independently in the process of arriving at the final wp omp , the techniques used will be detailed in sec .",
    "[ sec : opt ] .",
    "here are the polynomial forms of this optical potential beginning with the volume amplitudes : @xmath18 @xmath19 the surface amplitudes : @xmath20 @xmath21 the spin orbit amplitudes : @xmath22 @xmath23 the volume radius and diffusive terms : @xmath24 @xmath25 the surface radius and diffusive terms : @xmath26 @xmath27 the spin - orbit radius and diffusive terms : @xmath28 @xmath29 and finally the the coulomb radius term : @xmath30    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the general systemic target shape is correct in figs .",
    "[ assym4],[assym5 ] for the md , wp , and @xmath3 potentials but the magnitude differences are substantial .",
    "the constant density factor is 1.14 @xmath31 for the microscopic potential , .38 @xmath31 for the md calculation ( the isovector volume strength is three times the size of the microscopic calculation ) and the wp omp has .16 @xmath31 for the constant density ( the isovector volume strength is seven times the size of the microscopic ) .",
    "additionally the md optical potential has all its strength in the real component where the wp and microscopic potentials have isovector character distributed in both the real and imaginary term .",
    "others have used charge - exchange differential cross - sections to constrain the nucleon - nucleus optical potential asymmetric isovector term .",
    "future work on this omp could take that direction following the procedures as outlined in refs .",
    "@xcite which would help constrain these isovector magnitudes further .",
    "the ramifications of the large asymmetric potential differences can be ascertained also with reactions that the global optical potentials are currently fitted to .",
    "table  [ t4 ] examines the differences between the @xmath32ar(n , * ) and @xmath32ca(n , * ) cross sections with a 50 mev and 150 mev neutron projectile ( calcium subtracted from argon ) .",
    "the large differences generated in the elastic and inelastic cross section predictions are highly dependent on the contrasts in the antisymmetric isovector term between the three potentials .",
    "this reaction was chosen because both @xmath33 nuclei are stable and there are dramatic differences between the potentials at @xmath33 in the asymmetric term . using neutrons as projectiles also allows an ignorance of coulomb effects and coulomb correction terms .",
    "at the 50 mev projectile energy the isovector differences are large however the calculations fall within one or two standards deviation of experimental error  @xcite at the higher projectile energy of 150 mev , where it can be assumed that the born and impulse approximations have validity , the effects of correlations , coupled channels and potential distortions are at a minimum .",
    "the extreme dramatic reduction in the inelastic cross section and increase in the elastic cross section predicted by the wp omp differs wildly with the predicted large decrease in the elastic cross section seen by the md potential .",
    "likewise the kd and microscopic potentials offers a third very realistic conclusion ; that the differences between @xmath32ar(n , * ) and @xmath32ca(n , * ) cross sections with a 150 mev neutron projectile are relatively minor",
    ". there is at present no high energy @xmath32ar(n , * ) data to confer which optical potential is closest to experiment .",
    "experiments calculating the @xmath32ar cross sections would be a welcome addition as well as would other high energy neutron reaction data like recent experiments detailed in refs .",
    "@xcite which , if use @xmath34 target nuclei , are sensitive to the isovector term .",
    "the motivations for this work were to construct a phenemological nucleon - nucleus global optical potential that is suited for a wide range of nuclei targets and projectile energies which are within capacity of the exotic beam accelerators presently running and under development .",
    "we have succeeded in creating one isospin dependent potential which fits target nuclei @xmath35 and a projectile energy of @xmath36 mev@xmath1 mev .",
    "it compares well with two other recent global optical potentials  @xcite , its advantages are that it is one continuous optical potential which is designed to do systematic studies on mirror nuclei and chains of isotopes ( a observable calculator has also been made available to researchers to quickly use this potential for their own research  @xcite ) .",
    "we have also included an imaginary asymmetry term which is missing from other recent global optical potentials and have given comparative analysis on how the asymmetric potential terms in the three potentials dramatically differ from each other , microscopic potentials and the ramifications to experimentally testable observables .",
    "it was also ascertained that a benefit of fitting the proton and neutron observables simultaneously is the ability to accurately define the structure of the mass excesses for the charge - exchange reactions .",
    "there also was a critical examination of the validity of the traditional linear proportionality of @xmath2 applied in the asymmetry term .",
    "an examination of the calculation of the calcium and chromium experimental observables produced at 65 mev projectile energy show a continuing failure to produce great fits along the isotopic chain , indicative of a breakdown of this linear assymetry anasatz .",
    "further systematic experimental studies of chains of isotopes would help ascertain the direction of further theoretical studies .",
    "future work could extend this potential to heavier targets , test other forms of asymmetry potentials , examine spin - spin terms , use charge - exchange information to constrain data and determine algorithms to better weight the scattering observables .",
    "to better constrain the terms more elastic scattering data from traditional and exotic nuclei data is needed especially at the higher energies .    s.p.w . gratefully acknowledges the hospitality of the physics department at the florida state university , especially kirby kemper , during the author s sabbatical leave where this work was begun .",
    "we are also indebted to a _",
    "teragrid _ grant ( phy060025n ) , funded by the _ national science foundation _ , in which a bulk of the computational research was done .",
    "this work was also graciously supported by eckerd college internal grants which allowed students to work on this project over ensuing summers including a special debt to nicholas crotty for retrieving the experimental data and to eva romero luna for her help in arranging the final figures ."
