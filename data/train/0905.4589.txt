    "such kinds of metal hydrides , e.g. , beryllium and magnesium and beryllium - magnesium - based hydrides , which all have high weight percentage of hydrogen , are promising candidates for hydrogen storage . if they become metallic when subjected to high pressures , they may be candidates for high - temperature superconductivity . among them , mgh@xmath0 has been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "due to the experimental difficulties in material synthesis @xcite , on the other hand , a comprehensive understanding of beh@xmath0 is still being in progress .",
    "it had long been considered that beh@xmath0 was a polymer and did not crystallize without ternary additions .",
    "recently , however , smith _",
    "et al_. @xcite have successfully synthesized crystalline beh@xmath0 and first established the crystal structure as the body - centered orthorhombic by synchrotron - radiation - based powder x - ray diffraction . since this experimental establishment , to date theoretical studies on physical properties of crystalline beh@xmath0 are very scarce in the literature .",
    "et al_. @xcite and hantsch _",
    "et al_. @xcite have studied the structural stability of beh@xmath0 by performing first - principles total - energy calculations for various types of structural variants , among which they confirmed that the experimentally observed beh@xmath0 modification has the lowest total energy .",
    "no further theoretical studies have been reported , although more experimental works are going on to investigate the pressure dependence of physical properties of beh@xmath0 @xcite .    in this paper , we have carried out the first - principles calculations of ground - state behavior of beh@xmath0 at its experimentally established crystalline phase .",
    "results for the electronic and atomic structure , mechanical properties , charge density participation , and the nature of be - h chemical bonding , are systematically presented .",
    "our calculated results for elastic constants indicate that the experimentally observed orthorhombic phase of beh@xmath0 is mechanically stable .",
    "we determined that the ionic charge of be and h in beh@xmath0 are represented be@xmath3 and h@xmath4 , which , when compared to mg@xmath5 and h@xmath6 in mgh@xmath0 , indicates that the charge transfer process in beh@xmath0 is more prominent in mgh@xmath0 .",
    "the density - functional theory ( dft ) total energy calculations for the ground state beh@xmath0 were carried out using the vienna _ ab initio _ simulations package(vasp ) @xcite with the projected - augmented - wave ( paw ) pseudopotentials @xcite and plane waves .",

    "2 that the valence band maximum ( vbm ) and conduction band minimum ( cbm ) both appear at * x * point in the brillouin zone . by calculating the orbital - decomposed band charges inside the muffin - tin spheres of beh@xmath0 at vbm and cbm at * x * point , we find that the vbm has predominant h @xmath30 state character mixed with significant be @xmath31 contribution , while the cbm has obvious be @xmath32 and @xmath31 features mixed with a little h @xmath30 contribution .    .",

    "3 the following prominent features can be seen : ( i ) h @xmath30 state hybridizes with be @xmath32 and @xmath31 states in the whole range of the valence band .",
    "this is different from alkali - metal hydrides . due to the combined fact that there has only one valence electron with low ionization energy and",
    "the @xmath33 promotion energy is relatively large in alkali - metal elements , usually alkali - metal hydrides have entire ionic bonding in the sense that the valence electrons in alkali - metal atoms totally transfer to the h atoms . this clear ionic picture in alkali - metal hydrides becomes blurred in alkaline - earth - metal hydrides . in the present case of beh@xmath0 , in addition to a large ionic weight ( see the following charge - distribution analysis ) , a distinct covalent component also exists in the be@xmath2h bond , which is responsible for the stabilization of the low symmetric structure of beh@xmath0 .",
    "prominently , this covalency is dominated by the hybridization of h @xmath30 and be @xmath31 orbitals near the top of the valence band , while the hybridization of h @xmath30 and be @xmath32 orbitals is relatively weak , as shown in fig .",
    "3 . thus , the ionicity in the be@xmath2h bond is mainly featured by charge transfer from be @xmath32 to h @xmath30 atomic orbitals .",
    "interestingly , in beryllium oxide the be@xmath2o bond also exhibits strong covalency . as a result",
    ", bulk beo has wurtzite structure instead of the usual form of rocksalt structure taken by other alkaline - earth - metal oxides ; ( ii ) in the range of conduction band the dos is mainly featured by be @xmath32 and @xmath31 states , mixed with a little h @xmath30 states ; ( iii ) although there are three be@xmath2h bond configurations ( be1@xmath2h1 , b1@xmath2h2 , and be2@xmath2h2 ) , the dos propertie of these chemical bonds are almost the same and there is no remarkable difference between be1 and be2 ( or between h1 and h2 ) atoms .    in order to gain more insight into the nature of be@xmath2h chemical bonding in the orthorhombic beh@xmath0",

    "4(a ) is the plane composed by the three labeled atoms ( 1 to 3 ) shown in fig . 1",
    ", while the contour plane in fig .",
    "4(b ) is the ( 001 ) plane ( perpendicular to the _ c _ axis ) .",
    "it is these two planes that characterize the bond structure of beh@xmath0 . in both planes ,",
    "hydrogen charge density shape is deformed toward the direction to the nearest - neighbor be atoms .",
    "the charge density around h atoms is higher than that around be atoms .",
    "this further indicates aforementioned significant ionic - type charge transfer from be 2__s _ _ to h 1__s _ _ state . on the other hand , the charge densities at the midpoint of be@xmath2h bond",
    "is 0.46 e / @xmath34 , which is prominently higher than that in typical ionic crystals .",
    "this values is also much larger than that in isoelectroic mgh@xmath0 system .",
    "in fact , our calculation on mgh@xmath0 gave charge density of 0.17 e / @xmath34 at the midpoint of the mg@xmath2h bond , which is comparable well with recent experimental data @xcite of 0.2 e / @xmath34 .",
    "thus again , the charge distribution reveals that hydrogen is more strongly bonded to be in beh@xmath0 than to mg in mgh@xmath0 . as a result ,",
    "the calculated be@xmath2h bond length ( @xmath271.37  , see table i ) is remarkably smaller than the mg@xmath2h bond length ( 1.93  ) .",
    "although hydrogen atoms do not form bond , for illustration , here we also present the charge densities at the midpoint in the line that links the nearest - neighbor h atoms , which are @xmath270.2 e / @xmath34 for beh@xmath0 and @xmath270.15 e / @xmath34 for mgh@xmath0 .",
    "interestingly , the nearest - neighbor h - h distance in beh@xmath0 is also larger than that in mgh@xmath0 by @xmath270.25  .     where ( a ) is the plane established by the three labeled atoms ( 1 to 3 ) as shown in fig . 1 and ( b ) is the ( 001 ) plane",
    ". here @xmath35 stands for be1 , @xmath36 for be2 , @xmath37 for h1 and @xmath38 for h2 .",
    "the contour lines are drawn from 0.0 to 1.0 at 0.05 ev / @xmath34 intervals . ]    from above results , now it becomes clear that the bonding nature of hydrogen in beh@xmath0 , including the ionicity and covalency , is even more complex than in mgh@xmath0 .",
    "specially , because of complicated charge transfer process , which involves not only ionic but also covalent charge redistribution , one may wonder how to characterize the valency of h and be in beh@xmath0 . without knowing more appropriate way to valency , here we define and determine the so - called ionic radii of h and",
    "be by using the method raised by yu and lam @xcite in studying mgh@xmath0 . in this way , h ionic radius is defined as the half of average nearest - neighbor h - h distance .",
    "subtracting the h ionic radius from the average nearest - neighbor be - h distance gives the ionic radius of be .",
    "thus the ionic radius of h in our system is 1.131 @xmath39 and 0.237  for be ions .",
    "after integration , we find 0.005 electrons around be and 1.631 electrons around h. as a result , the valency of be and h are represented as be@xmath3 and h@xmath4 . for mgh@xmath0",
    "our calculations give the valency of mg and h as mg@xmath5h@xmath40 .",
    "clearly , our calculated valency shows that compared to the mgh@xmath0 system , charge transfer process is more prominent in beh@xmath0 system .",
    "therefore , we would like to derive that the the definition of ionic radius by yu and lam still works for more covalent beh@xmath0 hydride .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the structural , mechanical , electronic , and chemical bonding properties of beh@xmath0 through first - principles dft - gga calculations .",
    "the calculated structural parameters are in good agreement with available experimental results .",
