    "similarly , as in @xcite , one can consider a random noncrossing partition with boltzmann weights in the domain of attraction of an @xmath848-stable law , then partition each block independently at random using a noncrossing partition with boltzmann weights in the domain of attraction of an @xmath870-stable law , and so on .    in a certain sense ,",
