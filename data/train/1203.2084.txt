    "over the past nearly 30 years the method of reverberation mapping ( rm ) ( @xcite and reference therein ) has become one of the standard methods for studying the active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "it is based on the assumption that in a typical seyfert galaxy the source of continuous radiation near a black hole , named as accretion disc ( ad ) , is expected to be of order @xmath8  cm .",
    "photoionization of the gas located at a distance of order @xmath9  cm produces broad emission lines .",
    "the relationship between the continuum and emission line fluxes can be represented by the equation @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the observed continuum and emission - line light curves , and @xmath13 is the 1-d transfer function ( tf ) .",
    "the tf determines the emission line response to a @xmath14-function continuum pulse as seen by a distant observer .",
    "so , the emission lines `` echo '' or `` reverberate '' in response to the continuum changes with a delay @xmath15 .",
    "the size of the region where broad lines ( blr ) are formed can be written as @xmath16 .",
    "the primary task of the rm method is to use the observable @xmath11 and @xmath12 to solve the above integral equation for the tf in order to obtain information about the geometry and physical conditions in the blr .",
    "unfortunately , it is very difficult to find a unique and reliable solution to this equation .",
    "however , it is possible to find a temporal shift ( lag ) between the continuum and emission line light curves using the cross - correlation analysis .",
    "applying the virial assumption , the mass of the black hole can be determined when the blr size and the velocity dispersion of the blr gas are known @xcite .",
    "the present tremendous progress being made in black hole mass estimates can be attributed to the reverberation method .    on the other hand , different segments of a single emission line",
    "seem to be formed at different effective distances from the ionizing source . in that case",
    ", the response in the flux of emission line at line - of - sight velocity @xmath17 and time delay @xmath15 is caused by the 2-d transfer function or `` velocity delay map '' @xcite .",
    "the reverberation technique applied to different parts of a single emission line allows one to make conclusions about the velocity field of the blr gas .",
    "to the present time , considerable progress was made in understanding the direction of the blr gas motion @xcite .",
    "for example , some distinctive signatures for infalling gas motions in ngc  3516 and arp  151 @xcite were revealed : the blue side of the line lagging the red side .",
    "ngc  5548 shows the virialized gas motions with the symmetric lags on both the red and blue sides of line .",
    "however , the blr gas in ngc  3227 shows the signature of radial outflow : shorter lags for the blue - shifted gas and longer lags for the red - shifted gas @xcite .",
    "more than 40 agns have been studied by the rm up to now @xcite .",
    "however , the mrk  6 nucleus is absent in this list .",
    "just a few studies of this galaxy have been made by the reverberation method .",
    "we can mention the paper by @xcite based on the archive spectra of mrk  6 obtained from 19701991 using the image tube spectrograph at the 2.6-m telescope of the crimean astrophysical observatory ( crao ) .",
    "there is also another paper by @xcite that includes the results of the 19921997 observations with the same spectrograph but with a ccd detector . in this paper",
    "a lag in the flux variations of hydrogen lines with respect to the adjacent continuum flux variations was reported for the first time and changes in the line profiles were studied .",
    "mrk  6 is a seyfert 1.5 galaxy ( sy  1.5 ) .",
    "this galaxy was one of the first galaxies in which the strong variability of the @xmath0@xmath1 emission line profile was detected by @xcite .",
    "although there have not been many optical observations of mrk  6 , there are some radio studies of mrk  6 available @xcite , which revealed the complex structure of the radio emission .",
    "the x - ray emission from the mrk  6 nucleus @xcite exhibits a complex x - ray absorption and some authors assume that the blr is a possible location of this absorption complex @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present the results of our optical spectroscopic observations of mrk  6 during the monitoring campaign from 1998 to 2008 performed after publishing our earlier papers with observations made from 19701997 .",
    "for completeness we apply our analysis to all the spectral ccd observations that have been made since 1992 and we also use the results of our photometric observations in the @xmath18 band . throughout the entire work ,",
    "we take @xmath19 from our spectral estimates , the distance to mrk  6 equal to @xmath20  mpc , and @xmath2170  kms@xmath22 . the observations and data",
    "reduction are described in section  2 .",
    "we present the cross - correlation analysis in section  [ fccf ] , the line width measurements in section  [ linewidth ] ; the estimates of the black hole mass , the mass  luminosity and lag ",
    "luminosity diagrams are presented in sections  [ mass - bh ] and [ slm ] , the velocity - resolved reverberation lag analysis is performed in section  [ vrrlag ] .",
    "the results are summarized in section  [ sum ] .",
    "the @xmath0@xmath3  and @xmath0@xmath1  spectra of the seyfert galaxy mrk  6 were obtained from the crao 2.6-m shajn telescope .",
    "prior to 2005 we used the astro-550 ccd which had a size 580@xmath23  pixels and was cooled by liquid nitrogen .",
    "the dispersion was 2.2  pixel@xmath24 , and the spectral resolution was about 78   .",
    "the working wavelength range was about 1200   .",
    "the entrance slit width was 3 . for technical reasons it was not always possible to set the same position angle ( pa ) of the entrance slit .",
    "most of the observations were performed along pa@xmath25 or pa@xmath26 .",
    "the typical exposure time was about one hour .",
    "the `` extraction window '' was equal to 11 .    in july 2005",
    "the astro-550 ccd was replaced with the spec-10 @xmath27  pixel ccd , thermoelectrically cooled up to @xmath28@xmath29c . in this case",
    "the dispersion was 1.8  pixel@xmath24 .",
    "a 30 slit with a 90position angle was utilized for these observations . the higher quantum efficiency ( 95% max . ) and the lower read noise of this ccd allowed us to obtain higher quality spectra under shorter exposure times .",
    "the spectral wavelength range for these data sets was about 2000   near the @xmath0@xmath3 and @xmath0@xmath1  regions .",
    "however , the red and blue edges of the ccd frame are unusable because of vignetting . generally ,",
    "all spectra in both spectral regions were obtained with a single exposure during the whole night .",
    "our final data set for 19982008 consists of 135 spectra in the @xmath0@xmath1 region and 48 spectra in @xmath0@xmath3 .",
    "the mean signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) is equal to 32 for the astro-550 and 73 for the spec-10 in the @xmath0@xmath1 region and is equal to 40 and 66 in the @xmath0@xmath3 region , respectively .    as a rule ,",
    "each observation was preceded by four short - time ( @xmath3010  s ) exposures of the standard star bs  3082 , whose spectra were obtained at approximately the same zenith distance as that of the galaxy .",
    "the spectral energy distribution for these spectra was taken from @xcite .",
    "the standard star spectra were used to remove telluric absorption features from the spectra of mrk  6 , to provide the relative flux calibration , and to measure the seeing parameter defined as the fwhm of the cross - dispersion profile on the ccd image .",
    "the description of the primary data processing as well as some details of absolute calibration and measurements of the spectra are given in @xcite .",
    "the flux calibration was carried out by assuming the narrow emission line fluxes to be constant .",
    "we chose the narrow [ oiii]@xmath315007 ( for the @xmath0@xmath1 region ) and [ sii]@xmath326717 ,  6732 emission lines ( for the @xmath0@xmath3 region ) as the internal flux standards .",
    "their absolute fluxes were measured from the spectra obtained under photometric conditions by using the spectra of the comparison star bs  3082 .",
    "the mean fluxes in these lines are given in @xcite : f([oiii]@xmath315007)=@xmath33  erg  s@xmath24  @xmath34 ; f[sii ]  @xmath35=(1.61@xmath36  erg  s@xmath24  @xmath34 , and f[oi ]  @xmath316300=(0.597@xmath37  erg s@xmath24  @xmath34 .",
    "the [ sii ] lines reside on the far wings of the broad @xmath0@xmath3 line .",
    "thus , to measure their fluxes , we selected the pseudo - continuum zones closely spaced around each line .",
    "the line fluxes were measured by integrating the spectra over the specified wavelength intervals and above the continuum ( or local pseudo - continuum ) , which was fitted with a straight line in the selected zones . the mean continuum flux per unit wavelength",
    "was determined in two windows : at 51625186   ( designated as @xmath38 ) and 69857069   ( designated as @xmath39 ) .",

    "a more detailed examination of the bin light curves for 20052008 ( figure  [ hblc05 - 08 ] ) revealed that there is a trend for the @xmath0@xmath1  flux in bins 710 , which is almost absent in the bins  16 . following the advice of our reviewer we removed the trend from the @xmath0@xmath1  light curves for bins 710 .",
    "no more significant trends were found for other time intervals . in figure  [ hblag-5p ]",
    "the detrended lags and correlation coefficients are shown by open circles .",
    "after detrending procedure , the lag  velocity dependence became more similar to the lag ",
    "velocity dependence for the first period , for which the difference in lag between the blue and red wings is largest .",
    "@xmath1 in 20052008 over the velocity range from @xmath99 to @xmath100 ( top panels ) as well as the light curves of the broad @xmath0@xmath1  line in bin  5 in the velocity range from @xmath101 to @xmath102 , and in the bin  7 in the velocity range from 1000 to 2000  kms@xmath24 ( bottom panels ) .",
    "the continuum fluxes are in units of @xmath103  ergs@xmath24@xmath34@xmath24 , and the broad emission line fluxes are in units of @xmath103  ergs@xmath24@xmath34.,width=317 ]    so , it is most likely that the blr kinematic in mrk  6 is a combination of the keplerian gas motion and infall gas motion .",
    "we have reported our new results on the mrk  6 nucleus from 19982008 observational data together with the previous results published by @xcite .",
    "we found that    1 .",
    "the flux of the mrk  6 nucleus in 19922008 varied significantly in the continuum as well as in the @xmath0@xmath3  and @xmath0@xmath1  broad emission lines .",
    "the relative amplitude of the continuum flux variability is larger than in the hydrogen lines , and it is greater in the @xmath0@xmath1  line than in the @xmath0@xmath3  ( see table  [ stat ] ) .",
    "it is typical for the most of seyfert galaxies .",
    "this agrees with the predictions of @xcite based on new photo - ionization calculations of the blr - like gas .",
    "2 .   we found the average time delay between the total @xmath0@xmath1  flux and the continuum flux at 5170    to be @xmath104 days , and the time delay does not vary significant among individual time intervals .",
    "it seems that the size of the @xmath0@xmath1  emission region remains approximately the same over long time periods .",
    "the @xmath0@xmath3  flux responds to the changes in the @xmath38 continuum with a lag of @xmath105 days .",
    "3 .   when the continuum flux varies",
    ", the photo - ionization models predict the existence of the relation between the blr size and the luminosity .",
    "however , because the large uncertainties in the lag for individual time intervals we are unable to find such a relation . for the same reason , it is unable to obtain a dependence between the lag and line width , and it is impossible to check whether this dependence is consistent with the dependence @xmath106 expected for the gravitationally dominated motion .",
    "4 .   the @xmath0@xmath1  line width is larger than that of @xmath0@xmath3 .",
    "this is naturally explained by photo - ionization calculations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : the effective emission region of @xmath0@xmath1  is smaller and closer to the ionizing source than the effective region of @xmath0@xmath3 , and the gas velocities in @xmath0@xmath1  are higher .",
    "5 .   by examining the velocity - resolved lags for the broad @xmath0@xmath1  and @xmath0@xmath3  lines , we found that the lag in the high - velocity wings are shorter than in the line core . this indicates virial motions of gas in the blr .",
    "however , the lag is slightly larger in the blue wing than in the red wing for the entire time interval as well as for the individual periods considered in the present paper .",
    "this is a signature of the infall gas motion .",
    "probably the blr kinematic in the mrk  6 nucleus is a combination of the keplerian gas motion and infall gas motion .",
    "some profile segments often show poor correlation with the continuum flux . according to @xcite",
    "this effect can arise because off - axis sources of ionizing continuum flux can appear , which might not make a detectable contribution to the total continuum flux variability , but they will have an influence on the line only over a narrow range of radial velocity in the blr .",
    "if these local off - axis events will vary out of phase with the variability of the dominant source , the result will be to give a weak correlation between the continuum flux and the line flux in the narrow range of radial velocity .",
    "we determined the black hole mass from the lag and line width measurements of the @xmath0@xmath1  and @xmath0@xmath3  lines .",
    "the mass was found to be @xmath107 for the @xmath0@xmath1  line and slightly greater and less reliable from the @xmath0@xmath3  line .",
    "under such a mass and the luminosity of @xmath83(5100)=(2.51@xmath1080.38)@xmath109  ergs@xmath24 , the mrk  6 nucleus is located on the upper edge of the mass - luminosity diagram that corresponds to the eddington ratio of about 0.01 .",
    "this confirms the assumption ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that there is anticorrelation between broad - line widths and eddington luminosity ratio @xmath110 .",
    "the mrk  6 position on the blr  size  luminosity diagram does not contradict the fit @xmath5 determined by @xcite .",
