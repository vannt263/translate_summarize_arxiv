    "although the existence of massive galaxies at high redshifts is now well documented , there have been only a few high - resolution studies of their morphologies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "morphologies are important , because they may well retain signs of the formation history of the galaxies .",
    "this is particularly true for galaxies that show little or no recent star formation , so that we are able to observe relatively clean examples of the stellar population that formed earliest and that comprises the bulk of the mass of the galaxy . in this paper",
    ", we present deep _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) nicmos imaging of two galaxies with virtually pure old stellar populations at @xmath0 . in   2 ,",
    "we briefly recount how these galaxies were selected . in   3 , we describe the observations and reduction procedures . in   4 and   5 ,",
    "we analyze model fits to the images to determine morphologies , and in   6 we discuss the implications of our conclusions .",
    "we assume a flat cosmology with @xmath3 km  s@xmath4  mpc@xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "our procedure for selecting galaxies with old stellar populations is described in some detail in @xcite ; here we give a brief synopsis .",
    "we observe fields of radio sources in certain specific redshift ranges , selecting galaxies with photometric redshifts consistent with that of the radio source .",
    "radio sources generally serve as beacons for some of the more overdense regions in the early universe .",
    "furthermore , the specific redshift ranges selected are chosen to optimize discrimination with standard filter passbands between old stellar populations and highly reddened star - forming galaxies .",
    "one of these redshift ranges is @xmath6 , for which the 4000   break , strong in old stellar populations , falls between the @xmath7 and @xmath8 bands .",
    "we have used the @xcite ( bc03 ) spectral synthesis models , and , more recently , preliminary versions of the @xcite ( cb07 ) models , to evaluate and optimize our photometric selection of old stellar populations at various redshifts .",
    "the preliminary cb07 models include more realistic prescriptions for thermally pulsing asymptotic - giant - branch stars ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "although at low redshifts ( and for some seds at high redshifts ) the new models can significantly lower the masses estimated from @xmath9-band photometry , at the redshifts we are considering here for nearly pure old stellar populations , the masses ( and ages ) change hardly at all . the main effect of using the newer models is to reduce the amount of reddening required to obtain a good fit .    if a stellar population were to have an age of 2 gyr at @xmath10 ( corresponding to all of the stars forming at @xmath11 ) , its observed colors would be @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we use a photometric sieve procedure to optimize the selection with respect to available observing time , first obtaining relatively short @xmath7 and @xmath14 integrations ( typically 5 @xmath15 at @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xmath15 at @xmath18 ) .",
    "if any objects with @xmath19 are found , we then obtain @xmath8 and deeper @xmath7 imaging .",
    "finally , for fields with objects matching the expected spectral - energy distributions of an old stellar population at the redshift of the radio source , we attempt to obtain deep imaging at shorter wavelengths ( usually either @xmath20 or @xmath21 ) to set constraints on any residual star formation .",
    "among the galaxies found by this technique are one each in the fields of the radio galaxy 4c23.56 @xcite and the quasar 4c05.84 .",
    "we refer to these galaxies as 4c23.56er1  and 4c05.84er1 ; they are both luminous objects , and they have stellar populations that appear to be overwhelmingly dominated by old stars .",
    "we obtained most of the near - ir observations ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath14 ) with the cisco ir camera @xcite on the 8.2 m subaru telescope @xcite in observing runs on 2000 november 8 ( ut ) , 2001 august 5 and 6 , and 2002 may 30june 1 .",
    "the images have a scale of 0105 pixel@xmath4 and a field of @xmath22 .",
    "in addition , we carried out deep @xmath20-band imaging of both fields with the echelle spectrograph and imager ( esi ; @xcite ) on the keck ii telescope on 2002 august 7 .",
    "both the ir and optical imaging were reduced according to standard procedures using our own iraf scripts .",
    "the calibrations used observations of ukirt faint standards @xcite for the ir photometry and landolt fields @xcite for the @xmath20-band imaging .",
    "we also observed 4c23.56er1  at @xmath14 with the subaru 36-element curvature - sensing adaptive optics ( ao ) system @xcite and the infrared camera and spectrograph ( ircs ; @xcite ) on 2002 august 17 .",
    "these results were reported by @xcite , but we will refer to them again in this paper .",
    "we used ircs without the ao system , but with excellent natural seeing ( final images have fwhm of 035 ) to obtain a very deep image of the 4c05.84 field in the @xmath9 filter on 2004 august 1 .",
    "finally , we obtained @xmath7-band imaging of the 4c05.84 field with nirc2 and the keck ii laser - guide - star adaptive - optics system on 2007 august 21 .",
    "the nicmos observations used the nic2 camera ( 0075 pixel@xmath4 ) and the f110w and f160w filters .",
    "they were obtained on ut 2005 january 3 ( 4c05.84er1 , f160w , total exposure 5376 s ) , 2005 january 4 ( 4c23.56er1 , f160w , total exposure 8192 s ) , 2005 january 8 ( 4c05.84er1 , f110w , total exposure 8448 s ) , and 2005 may 16 ( 4c23.56er1 , f110w , total exposure 11264 s ) as part of _ hst _ program 10418 . after doing a first - pass combination of the images to get a rough idea of the quality of the data",
    ", we went back to the _ calnica _ processed images and corrected these for bias offsets and inverse flatfield effects using the stsdas _ pedsky _ task .",
    "most of the f110w images were obtained in orbits impacted by passages through the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) and needed special processing .",
    "we used the idl routine saa_clean.pro @xcite to generate an image of the persistence from the routinely taken post - saa dark images and subtract it from the science images .",
    "finally , for these images , _ pedsky _ was run again to remove any residual bias pedestals .",
    "we then generated a bad - pixel mask from the data quality file , adding an additional mask for the coronographic occulter , which produces background that is detected in both filters .",
    "most of the cosmic rays were removed with the contributed iraf procedure _ lacos_im _ @xcite . at this point",
    "the images from the individual dither positions were combined onto a subsampled grid with the stsdas _ drizzle _ task to produce the final image . to choose the optimum _ drizzle _ parameters for our purposes",
    ", we performed a series of tests with artificial psfs generated by tiny tim .",
    "we ended up choosing a drop size of 0.7 and a subsampling factor of 2 .",
    "the final combined images had fwhm of 0133 for the f160w images and",
    "0115 for the 4c23.56er1  f110w image .",
    "we were unfortunately unable to produce a useful image of 4c05.84er1  in the f110w band because of a combination of the object s low surface brightness at that wavelength and residual effects on the detector of the previous saa passage .",
    "the final @xmath23 surface brightness limits ( in the vega system ) were @xmath24 and @xmath25 for 4c23.56er1 , and @xmath26 for 4c05.84er1 .",
    "the drizzling process inevitably introduces some level of correlation between adjacent pixels .",
    "where we needed to estimate absolute errors ( such as for our radial - surface - brightness plots ) , we made a statistical correction to the error determinations , following the prescriptions of @xcite    although we obtained images of stars for point - spread - function ( psf ) determination at the ends of some of the orbits , psfs modeled from tinytim were quite consistent with the stellar profiles .",
    "subtracting tinytim models from the observed stars gave residuals that were less than 1.5%  ( rms ) of the peak over the central fwhm region ( and much lower outside this region ) , with maximum pixel deviations of 3% .",
    "the tinytim profiles also have the advantage that they can be generated on a subsampled grid to minimize interpolation errors in matching the profiles to the undersampled nicmos2 images .",
    "we accordingly used subsampled tinytim model profiles in our analysis .",
    "in the field of the @xmath27 radio galaxy 4c23.56 , our photometric selection procedure picked out a galaxy that had previously been noted as a very red object by @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , we have already reported on our subaru ao / ircs imaging of 4c23.56er1(@xcite ; there , the galaxy is referred to as 4c23.56kc68 ) .",
    "the main conclusions of that paper were that ( 1 ) the galaxy indeed has a redshift close to that of the radio galaxy , ( 2 ) the best fit to the photometry is an old ( 23 gyr ) stellar population with little reddening ( @xmath28 of @xcite extinction ) , and that ( 3 ) the morphology of this massive , old galaxy looked surprisingly disklike , with a projected axial ratio of 0.3 and a srsic index of 1.5 . because the details of the previous observations are available in that paper , and in a brief follow - up report @xcite , we restrict our discussion here to a comparison of the nicmos imaging with the previous ao imaging .",
    "the nicmos f110w and f160w images are shown in fig .",
    "[ 4c23mos ] , along with the best - fit srsic models ( convolved with the psf ) , the residuals from the subtraction of the models from the data , and , again , the best - fit models ( but _ without _ convolution with the psf ) .",
    "we determine total magnitudes for 4c23.56er1  from the srsic models , finding ( on the vega system ) @xmath29 and @xmath30 after correction for galactic reddening @xcite .",
    "the quoted uncertainties include only sky noise and uncertainty in the sky level ; they do not include any deviations between the models and the data ( which are in any case quite small over the region of good s / n for the data ) or other potential systematic effects .",
    "we discuss the f160w image first , since it has a much higher s / n ratio than does the f110w image .",
    "figure [ 4c23hrsb ] shows the radial - surface - brightness profile for the f160w image of 4c23.56er1 , along with the best - fit @xmath31-law , exponential , and srsic profiles , determined using galfit @xcite . among these",
    ", the srsic profile clearly gives the best fit , as expected , because of the extra degree of freedom in the model .",
    "the srsic profile has an index @xmath32 , an effective radius @xmath33 , and axial ratio @xmath34 . the uncertainties in @xmath35 and @xmath36 have been estimated by re - running the models with the sky level set @xmath37 above and below its median value . from our subaru ao imaging in the @xmath14 band @xcite , we had obtained @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , so the two independent profiles in different bands are in remarkably good agreement .",
    "although the ao imaging had slightly better fwhm , and the two datasets had similar s /",
    "n near the center of the galaxy , the nicmos2 data extends farther in semi - major axis because of its lower sky background .",
    "we show a comparison of the two profiles in the region of overlap in fig .",
    "[ 4c23drsbp ] .",
    "both the @xmath31-law and exponential profiles fit the observed profile poorly . adding a small ( @xmath41 ) , weak ( 14%  of total light ) bulge component to an exponential profile with an @xmath42",
    "gives a fit that is as good as that of the srsic profile within a semi - major axis of 06 but somewhat worse beyond this radius .    the f110w image shown in fig .",
    "[ 4c23mos ] , which samples the morphology shortward of the 4000   break ( assuming that 4c23.56er1  has the same redshift as 4c23.56 itself ) , superficially has an even more `` disky '' appearance than does the f160w image .",
    "this is partly due to the sharper psf at this wavelength : notice that the best - fit srsic models without psf convolution look much more similar than do the models with psf convolution .",
    "nevertheless , there may be a detectable difference in morphology in the two bands .",
    "the f110w srsic model has an index @xmath43 ( _ i.e. , _  essentially a pure exponential ) , an effective radius of @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "the radial - surface - brightness profile is shown in fig .",
    "[ 4c23jrsb ] , along with the best - fit srsic model and the f160w srsic model ( adjusted by a constant magnitude offset to approximately match the f110w points ) .",
    "the observed differences are barely significant , given the uncertainties , but they seem to indicate a small color gradient , such that the outer parts of the galaxy are slightly bluer ( at least out to a semi - major axis of 07 , at which point the uncertainty in the sky background level becomes dominant ) .",
    "this can not be a large effect because of the tight upper limits on the @xmath20 and @xmath21-band magnitudes ( see @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , it does suggest a possible slight decrease in mean age and/or mean metallicity of the stellar population as one progresses from the center to the outskirts of the galaxy .",

    "we have explored a range of exponentially decreasing star - forming models as well as instantaneous burst models ; we have also considered models with metallicities of solar , 0.4 solar , and 2.5 solar .",
    "the formal best - fit model sed is at a redshift of 2.93 , substantially higher than that of 4c05.84 itself .",
    "this model has a 0.4-solar - metallicity population with an age of 900 myr , an exponential time constant of 100 myr , and a reddening @xmath49 mag .",
    "if we restrict ourselves to models with redshifts close to that of the quasar , we get a reasonable fit with a solar - metallicity model with a redshift of 2.40 , an age of 1.02 gyrs , an exponential time constant of 200 myr , and a reddening @xmath50 mag .",

    "[ 4c05sed ] .",
    "we have no firm grounds for choosing one of these seds over the other ; but , given the uncertainties in the models and possible star - formation histories , we will accept for the remainder of this paper that the redshift closer to that of 4c05.84 itself is the correct one . in either case",
    ", we are dealing with a massive galaxy comprising stars that mostly formed @xmath1 gyr before the observed epoch .",

    "[ 4c05mos ] , along with our best - fit galfit model .",
    "we have tried a series of models , including , again , @xmath31-law , exponential , and srsic .",

    "[ 4c05hrsb ] . in this case",
    ", even the srsic profile is not a particularly good fit .",
    "we get a significantly better fit with a two - component model incorporating a small @xmath31-law bulge comprising @xmath52%  of the light and an exponential disk accounting for the rest .",
    "this model is compared with the best srsic profile fit in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ 4c05hrsb ] .",
    "for the two - component model , the disk component has an effective radius @xmath53 , and the bulge component has @xmath54 .",
    "this best - fit model gives a total magnitude ( on the vega system ) @xmath55 .",
    "there is some evidence from our @xmath20 and @xmath21-band imaging and our recent keck ao imaging in the @xmath7 band that the bulge component virtually disappears at these shorter wavelengths , indicating that the two morphological components have different stellar populations .",
    "such a result that would not be surprising .",
    "the sed shown in fig .",
    "[ 4c05sed ] would then be the linear combination of the two seds , with the bulge likely being a nearly pure old population and with younger stars being confined to the disk component .",
    "we stress , however , that even the disk component must be dominated by old ( @xmath56 few hundred myr ) stars , with little very recent star formation .",
    "we have experimented with a range of combinations of seds at the quasar redshift , but none with simple star - formation histories ( instantaneous bursts or exponentially decaying bursts ) gave a significantly better fit than did the single - population seds shown in fig .",
    "[ 4c05sed ] .",
    "we will explore this possibility in more detail elsewhere .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] summarizes the parameters for the two galaxies .",
    "the morphologies of both 4c23.56er1  and 4c05.84er1  appear to be dominated by disks of old stars .",
    "however , the disks are quite different in scale .",
    "4c05.84er1 , at least , also appears to have a small bulge comprising about 1/3 of the total light in the f160w filter ( @xmath57  , rest frame ) .",
    "we can not exclude the possibility that 4c23.56er1  also has a weak bulge , with up to @xmath58% of the total light in the f160w filter ; indeed , if the slight apparent difference in morphology between the f160w and f110w images is real , such a difference would seem to favor this possibility .",
    "but it is the presence of massive , old disks that continues to give the strongest constraint on formation mechanisms .",
    "such disks also have been seen at redshifts @xmath59 , where normal ellipticals with @xmath31-law profiles are also found @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to imagine that these massive disks could have formed via any process other than the dissipative collapse of a large cloud of gas .",
    "such disks are also unlikely to have survived major merging events , although the bulge component in 4c05.84er1  may testify to either some level of minor merging activity or bulge building via disk instabilities .    for galaxies at @xmath0 ,",
    "the evidence for a dominant old stellar population depends on the inflection in the sed shortward of the @xmath8 band , and establishing this inflection with optical / near - ir photometry depends on the relatively short baseline from the @xmath8 to the @xmath9 band .",
    "furthermore , at the present epoch , essentially all strongly disk - dominated galaxies show evidence for continued star formation .",
    "it is therefore not too surprising that claims of passive disks at high redshift should be doubted ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "however , as fig .",
    "[ 4c05sed ] shows , _ spitzer _ irac data is entirely consistent with the sed of a moderately old stellar population , and no plausible sed incorporating very recent star formation combined with dust would fit the observed photometry .",
    "we have recently also obtained irac imaging of the field of 4c23.56 , and our analysis of these data shows that the irac photometry falls squarely on our best - fit solar - metallicity bc03 model determined from the optical / near - ir photometry alone : an instantaneous burst with an age of 2.6 gyr and an extinction @xmath60 mag @xcite . using the more recent preliminary cb07 models , with their improved treatment of agb stars ,",
    "we obtain a stellar population age of 2.8 gyr with @xmath61 .",
    "again , no plausible model with significant star formation and reddening would fit these data .",

    "assuming solar metallicities and a @xcite initial mass function , we obtain a mass of @xmath71 for 4c23.56er1  and @xmath72 for 4c05.84er1(assuming the model at @xmath73 with @xmath74 ) .",
    "while the stellar - population age of 4c05.84er1  indicates that the last major star - formation episode occurred at @xmath75 , when the universe was @xmath76 gyr old , 4c23.56er1  has a stellar - population age that is formally slightly greater than the age of the universe at @xmath27 . clearly , the likely errors in the age determination and the usual caveats regarding the age - metallicity degeneracy mitigate any implied paradox",
    "nevertheless , this massive galaxy must have formed at a very high redshift .",
    "models with [ fe / h ] @xmath77 give an age of 1.9 gyr , but with a significantly worse fit .",
    "it therefore seems likely that galaxy formation models will have to allow for the presence of early - forming massive disks .",
    "this means that , at least in some dense regions , it has been possible to form @xmath78 @xmath79 of stars within a relatively short time via dissipative collapse and without the aid of major mergers . while our selection criteria have ensured that the galaxies we have discussed here comprise essentially pure old stellar populations , they may well be representative of many massive galaxies at high redshift , most of which would not be in our sample if they retained even tiny amounts of residual star formation or if they had had any significant star formation within a few hundred myr prior to the epoch at which we observe them .",
    "4c05.84er1  has a luminosity and an effective radius that are similar to those of many local galaxies .",
    "our best - fitting srsic model has @xmath80 kpc . for comparison , for galaxies of similar mass from the sloan survey with srsic @xmath81 , @xcite find @xmath82 kpc .",
    "this galaxy could become , with passive evolution and perhaps a few minor mergers to increase the bulge - to - disk ratio somewhat , a typical s0 galaxy at the present epoch . on the other hand",

    "this means that the stellar mass surface density is much higher than for local galaxies , a result that has also been found for other samples of distant red galaxies ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it would seem that the only likely path for such galaxies to evolve to objects consistent with the local population of galaxies is through dissipationless mergers .",
    "there is recent evidence that the most massive galaxies in the local universe are likely the result of dry mergers of galaxies with stars that are already old and with very little gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "<S> we present the results of nicmos imaging of two massive galaxies photometrically selected to have old stellar populations at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> both galaxies are dominated by apparent disks of old stars , although one of them also has a small bulge comprising about 1/3 of the light at rest - frame 4800  . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of massive disks of old stars at high redshift means that at least some massive galaxies in the early universe have formed directly from the dissipative collapse of a large mass of gas . </S>",
    "<S> the stars formed in disks like these may have made significant contributions to the stellar populations of massive spheroids at the present epoch . </S>"
