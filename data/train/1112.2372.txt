    "in orthogonal frequency division multiple access ( ofdma ) systems , resource allocation amounts to finding the optimal assignment of subcarriers to users , and , for each user , the allocation of rate or power over the assigned subset of sub - carriers . in this paper , we focus on the problem of minimizing the total transmit power , subject to delivering specified data rates , by power assignment and subcarrier allocation .",
    "the popularity of ofdma for wireless communications has led to an intense research effort in this area .",
    "a majority of the works has focused on heuristic and thus sub - optimal solutions , see , for example , @xcite , and the references therein . for global optimality , a branch - and - bound algorithm is developed in @xcite .",
    "we address a complementary but fundamental aspect of the resource allocation problem : to what extent is it tractable ?",
    "in contrast to the significant amount of research on algorithms , works along the line of tractability analysis are few @xcite .",
    "the edge of fundamental understanding of problem tractability is formed in respect of the following limitations . in @xcite , the power on each subcarrier",
    "is assumed to be given , i.e. , it can be arbitrarily set to any fixed value for the purpose of proving complexity .",
    "thus the result does not apply to the problem where powers are optimization variables . in @xcite ,",
    "the resource allocation problem is shown to be np - hard for one particular type of rate function @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the rate as a function of power @xmath2 for the @xmath3th user and @xmath4th subcarrier , and @xmath5 is the set of all increasing functions such that @xmath6 . by this result",
    ", there exists some ( but possibly ill - behaved ) function in @xmath5 for which the problem is np - hard .",
    "however , the result does not carry over to well - behaved subclasses of functions in @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , for any @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the set of linear functions , the problem is solvable in polynomial time ( see section [ sec : tractability ] ) . thus , whereas dealing with @xmath5 is in general intractable for the problem in question , there exists some subclass in @xmath5 that admits global optimality at low complexity .    for the ( wide ) class of functions in @xmath5 but not in @xmath8 , the tractability of the resource allocation problem remains unknown and thus calls for investigation .",
    "the aspect is of most relevance for the class of increasing and concave functions @xmath9 , for which @xmath10 holds .",
    "indeed , it is very commonly assumed that the rate function is given by @xmath11 , with @xmath12",
    ". we will thus investigate the complexity for this representative case of @xmath9 , and , if the problem is np - hard for the function , examine to what extent restrictions on input structure ( e.g. , assuming the number of subcarrier for each user is part of the input ) will admit better tractability .",
    "the specific contributions are as follows .",
    "* we rigorously prove that given the representative logarithmic rate function @xmath11 with @xmath13 , the resource allocation problem is np - hard .",
    "since this rate function is in @xmath14 , it follows that in the hierarchy @xmath15 , the hardness result holds except for the linear case .",
    "the contribution leads a significant refinement of the result of tractability . *",
    "we extend the np - hardness analysis to arrive at a much stronger result .",
    "namely , the problem remains np - hard , even if the following two restrictions are _ jointly _ imposed : 1 ) the subcarriers allocated to each user form a consecutive block , and 2 ) the block size is given as part of the problem s input .",
    "we also prove that , with these two restrictions , there is a special case admitting polynomial - time tractability .",
    "* we identify a tractable problem subclass , with the structure that the channels can be partitioned into an _",
    "arbitrarily many but constant _ number of groups , possibly with varying group size , and the channels within each group have uniform gain for each user ( but may differ by user ) .",
    "the original problem is , in fact , equivalent to having the number of groups equal to the number of subcarriers .",
    "the tractable subclass goes beyond the logarithmic rate function ",
    "the result holds as long as the single - user resource allocation is tractable .",
    "moreover , we prove that recognizing this problem class is tractable as well .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the system model is given in section  [ sec : system ] . in section",
    "[ sec : tractability ] , we provide and prove the base result of np - hardness .",
    "section  [ sec : tractabilityrestriction ] is devoted to the problem s tractability with restrictions on channel allocation . in section  [ sec :",
    "tractableclass ] , we consider the problem class with structured channel gain and prove its tractability . in addition , we prove that recognizing this problem class is computable in polynomial time .",
    "conclusions are given in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "consider an ofdma system with @xmath16 users and @xmath17 subcarriers . in this paper ,",
    "the terms subcarrier and channel are used interchangeably . for convenience , we define sets @xmath18 and @xmath19 . notation @xmath20 is reserved for the rate as a function of the transmission power @xmath21 for the @xmath3th user and @xmath4th subcarrier .",
    "the inverse function @xmath22 , returning the power for supporting a given rate , is denoted by @xmath23 .",
    "the required rate of user @xmath3 is denoted by @xmath24 .",
    "the forthcoming analysis focuses on the representative increasing , concave rate function @xmath25 , where @xmath12 represents the channel gain ( normalized such that the noise variance is one ) .",
    "hence , the corresponding signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) is @xmath26 .",
    "some of the tractability results generalize to @xmath5 ; we will explicitly mention the generalization when it applies .",
    "the optimization problem is to minimize the total power by joint channel and rate allocation , such that the users required rate targets are met .",
    "the problem is formulated formally below . throughout the rest of the paper",
    ", we refer to the problem as minimum - power channel allocation ( mpca ) .",
    "user set @xmath18 and channel set @xmath27 with @xmath28 , positive channel gain @xmath29 , and positive rate targets @xmath30 .    a channel partitioning represented by @xmath31 , where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , for all @xmath34 , and non - negative power @xmath35 , @xmath36 , such that @xmath37 and the total power @xmath38 is minimized .    by the rate function",
    ", there is a unique mapping between rate allocation and power expenditure .",
    "in addition , at optimum , the rate may be zero on some of the allocated channels of a user .",
    "given the channel allocation , power optimization is determined by solving the single - user rate allocation problem by water - filling @xcite in linear time ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the combinatorial nature of the multi - user problem stems from the fact that the users can not share a subcarrier , and the core of problem - solving is channel partitioning .",
    "to motivate the investigation of tractability in view of the current literature , two remarks are noteworthy .",
    "first , an np - hard problem may become tractable by imposing restrictions to the structure of its input parameters ( e.g. , the shape of the objective function ) .",
    "an example is the traveling salesman problem ( tsp ) having a cost function with the so called klyaus - matrix structure ( meaning that inversed triangular distance inequality holds ) . in this case",
    ", tsp is solvable in polynomial time @xcite . for mpca",
    ", it is in fact polynomially solvable , if the power - rate function would be linear ( see the end of this section ) . as the second remark",
    ", an np - hard problem may become tractable by removing some of its constraints ( and hence enlarging the solution space ) .",
    "for example , minimum spanning tree ( mst ) with constrained node degree is np - hard , but becomes easily - solved if this constraint is removed .",
    "it has been widely accepted that mpca and other related ofdma resource allocation problem are difficult . however , to the best of our knowledge , no formal analysis other than the results in @xcite is available .",
    "the study in @xcite formalizes the np - hardness result with the assumption that the powers on all channels are given .",
    "this is equivalent to introducing constraints fixing the power values . by the second remark above",
    ", the result does not answer the tractability if these constraints are removed ( that is , the original problem with variable power ) .",
    "indeed , for any linear rate function as well as the problem class in section [ sec : tractableclass ] , the np - hardness proof in @xcite remains valid for fixed power , but these problem classes with variable power are solvable in polynomial time .",
    "for the analysis in @xcite , the proof requires unbounded power growth for arbitrarily small rate increase .",
    "specifically , for the power function @xmath39 , @xmath40 is @xmath41 times higher than @xmath42 , for arbitrary positive integers @xmath4 and @xmath41 .",
    "this assumption of ill - behaved power - rate function excludes not only @xmath43 ( the inverse of the logarithmic rate function ) , but also all locally lipschitz continuous functions .",
    "recall that a ( not necessarily continuous ) function @xmath39 is locally lipschitz continuous , if for any @xmath44 , there exists a small real number @xmath45 and an arbitrarily large but constant real number @xmath46 , such that @xmath47 , that is , the growth of the function is bounded when the change in the input diminishes . clearly , @xmath39 is not locally lipschitz continuous , if @xmath40 increases by factor @xmath41 over @xmath42 for any @xmath4 and arbitrarily large @xmath41 .",
    "hence , by the previous remark of the impact of cost function on tractability , the tractability under more well - behaved functions calls for investigation .",
    "we provide the tractability results that overcome the limitations of the currently available analysis in two aspects .",
    "first , we present a rigorous proof of the problem s np - hardness with the representative logarithmic rate function .",
    "second , in the next section , we extend the proof to reach a much stronger result , stating that the problem remains np - hard even with two heavy restrictions on channel allocation .",
    "[ theo : nphard ] mpca , as defined in section [ sec : system ] , is np - hard .",
    "as the proof is rather technical , we outline the basic idea and defer the details to appendix a. the proof uses a reduction from 3-satisfiability ( 3-sat ) .",
    "two groups of users are defined . at optimum , each user in the first group either uses one channel of superior channel gain , or splits the rate on three inferior channels , but not both .",
    "this corresponds to the true / false value assignment in 3-sat .",
    "the optimal power for this group of users is a constant , while the optimal power for the second user group gives the correct answer to 3-sat .",
    "[ theo : nphardrate ] mpca remains np - hard , even if the rate requirements of the users are uniform .",
    "follows immediately from the equal - rate values used in the proof of theorem [ theo : nphard ] .    earlier in this section , it was claimed that mpca with any linear rate function is tractable . even if this case is not much of practical interest , it is instructive in showing the importance of input assumption on problem tractability .",
    "[ theo : linear ] mpca with linear rate function @xmath48 , where @xmath49 , @xmath50 , is solvable in polynomial time .",
    "since the rate ( and hence power ) function is linear , it follows that for any user @xmath3 , it is optimal to allocate the entire rate @xmath24 to a single channel . specifically , denoting by @xmath51 the channel set allocated to @xmath3 ,",
    "the optimal selection is the channel giving @xmath52 .",
    "because of this structure at optimum , mpca reduces to pairing the @xmath16 users with @xmath16 out of the @xmath17 channels .",
    "hence the problem is equivalent to a minimum - weight matching problem ( also known as minimum - cost assignment @xcite ) in a bipartite graph with node sets @xmath53 and @xmath54 ; the former represents the augmentation of @xmath55 by @xmath56 artificial users . for edge @xmath57 , with @xmath58 and @xmath59 ,",
    "the cost is @xmath60 .",
    "all edges adjacent to artificial users have zero cost .",
    "because the assignment problem is polynomial - time solvable , the theorem follows .    in light of theorem  [ theo : nphard ] ,",
    "corollary  [ theo : nphardrate ] , and theorem  [ theo : linear ] , we remark on the significance of assumption of input on tractability , by revisiting the result provided in @xcite . in this reference ,",
    "the result is proven for fixed power , that is , the power of each channel is part of problem input . under this condition",
    ", @xcite provides an elegant hardness proof of a reduction from the number partitioning problem , by setting specific power values on the channels .",
    "as long as power is fixed , a line - by - line copy of the proof in @xcite remains valid even if the underlying mpca rate function is linear .",
    "a similar observation applies to the tractable problem class that will be detailed in section [ sec : tractableclass ] . in conclusion , for the original mpca problem having power allocation as part of the output ( for which the key assumption of @xcite does not apply ) ,",
    "our analysis provides new insights in the tractability rather than contradicting the previous results . @xmath61",
    "consider imposing jointly two restrictions to channel allocation .",
    "first , the number of channels to be allocated to each user is given .",
    "tractability under this restriction is of significance to two - phase ofdma resource allocation ( see @xcite ) that determines the number of channels per user in phase one , followed by channel allocation in phase two .",
    "the second restriction is the use of consecutive channels , that is , the channels of every user must be consecutive in the sequence @xmath62 ; this channel - adjacency constraint has been considered in , for example , @xcite .",
    "we prove that mpca remains np - hard even with these two seemingly strong restrictions , although there is a special case admitting polynomial - time tractability .",
    "[ theo : nphardrestriction ] mpca remains np - hard , even if the number of channels allocated to each user , i.e. , the cardinality of @xmath63 , is given in the input , and @xmath64 must contain consecutive elements in the channel sequence @xmath62 .",
    "as we prove the result via an augmentation of reduction proof of in appendix [ sec : appa ] , the details are deferred to appendix [ sec : appb ] . in brief , the proof is built upon introducing a set of additional channels in the mpca instance in appendix [ sec : appa ] , in a way such that , at optimum , the channels allocated to each user are consecutive and the corresponding cardinality is known .",
    "consider further narrowing down the problem to the case where @xmath54 consists of @xmath16 uniform - sized subsets of consecutive channels , and @xmath17 is a multiple of @xmath16 .",
    "for this case , the problem is tractable , as proven below .",
    "[ theo : special ] if @xmath17 is divisible by @xmath16 , and it is restricted to allocate exactly @xmath65 consecutive channels to each user , then mpca is tractable with time complexity @xmath66 .",
    "we prove the result by a polynomial - time transformation to the well - solved matching problem in a bipartite graph . for the problem setting in question ,",
    "channel partition is unique - the @xmath16 subsets created by the partition are @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , each containing @xmath71 channels .",
    "the bipartite graph has @xmath72 nodes representing the users and the subsets of channels",
    ". for each pair of the two node groups , say user @xmath3 and channel subset @xmath73 , there is an edge of which the cost equals the power of meeting the user rate using the channels in @xmath73 . this cost is computed in @xmath74 time ( by single - user rate allocation ) .",
    "the complexity of computing all the edge costs is hence @xmath75 .",
    "maximum - weighted matching in a bipartite graph of @xmath76 nodes and @xmath77 edges is solved in @xmath78 time @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the second term is dominating , giving a time complexity of @xmath79 , which completes the proof .",
    "theorem [ theo : special ] provides a generalization of the trivial case of @xmath80 . for @xmath80 , solving mpca amounts to finding an optimal matching with complexity @xmath79 .",
    "moreover , from the proof , it follows that the analysis generalizes to any rate function in @xmath5 , except that the complexity of single - use rate allocation has to be accounted for accordingly .",
    "the observation yields the following corollary .",
    "[ theo : specialinc ] the time required for computing the optimum to the mpca problem class in theorem [ theo : special ] is of @xmath81 , where @xmath82 denotes the time complexity of optimal rate allocation of a single user on @xmath65 channels .",
    "denote by @xmath83 a ( possibly large ) fixed positive integer independent of @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath84 consider mpca in which the channels can be partitioned into ( at most ) @xmath83 groups where every user in the same group has the same channel gain , but the channel gains differ by user .",
    "thus , we can write @xmath85 , such that for any channel @xmath86 , the channel gain depends only on the user index @xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath87 .",
    "equivalently , the rate functions belong to the subclass that satisfy @xmath88 note that the channel groups may vary in size , and the channel gain still differs by user within each group . in the sequel , we refer to the problem class as @xmath83-mpca .",
    "the problem class is justified by scenarios with @xmath83 distinct bands and channel difference is overwhelmingly contributed by the separation of the bands in the spectrum , whereas the subcarriers with each band are considered invariant for each user .",
    "consider @xmath89-mpca .",
    "the problem structure is significantly simpler than the general case .",
    "namely , the optimization decision is no longer which , but how many channels each user should use .",
    "it follows that , for any subset of users @xmath90 , the optimum allocation of @xmath91 channels ( with @xmath92 ) among the users in @xmath93 is independent of channel allocation of the rest the users .",
    "thus @xmath89-mpca exhibits an optimal substructure , i.e. , a part of the optimal solution is also optimal for that part of the problem .",
    "the observation leads to a dynamic programming line of argument for problem - solving .",
    "as proven below , the solution strategy guarantees optimality in polynomial time .",
    "[ theo:1mpca ] global optimum of @xmath89-mpca can be computed by dynamic programming in @xmath94 time .",
    "consider the partial problem of optimally allocating @xmath91 channels to the users in @xmath95 with @xmath96 , and @xmath97 the corresponding optimum power .",
    "clearly , at the optimum of this subproblem , the number of channels of user @xmath3 is an integer in the set @xmath98 .",
    "( the upper bound @xmath99 corresponds to having @xmath100 channels left for the other @xmath100 users . )",
    "allocating @xmath101 channels to user @xmath3 , the power equals @xmath102 , where @xmath103 denotes the power of user @xmath3 with @xmath41 channels .",
    "this gives the following recursive formula for computing the optimal number of channels for user @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath104 we arrange the values @xmath97 for @xmath105 and @xmath106 in an @xmath107 matrix",
    ". entries corresponding to infeasible solutions are called invalid , and their values are denoted by @xmath108 . in the matrix ,",
    "@xmath109 for all entries where @xmath110 , or @xmath111 .",
    "we compute the valid entries as follows .",
    "for the first row , computing the entries @xmath112 in the given order are straightforward , and each entry requires @xmath113 computing time .",
    "next , entries @xmath114 , i.e. , one channel per user for the first @xmath3 users , are calculated in @xmath115 time for @xmath105 .",
    "the bulk of the computation calculates the remaining entries row by row , starting from row two . for row @xmath3 ,",
    "the computations follow the order @xmath116 .",
    "each of these entries is calculated using formula . for the valid entries of a row , the total number of comparisons that they are used for computing the next row is @xmath117 .",
    "hence the complexity for computing row @xmath118 , is of @xmath119 , and the overall time complexity is of @xmath94 .",
    "the last entry computed , @xmath120 , gives the optimal allocation of the @xmath17 channels to the @xmath16 users and hence solves @xmath89-mpca . in parallel , the solution is stored in a second matrix of same size .",
    "solution recording clearly has lower complexity than @xmath94 , and the theorem follows .    in the following theorem , we generalize the dynamic programming concept to any positive integer @xmath83 .",

    "interestingly , the problem admits a polynomial - time solution if the rate function is an increasing linear function .",
    "hence , progress in the fundamental understanding on the tractability of the problem is made in the following sense : we have sharpened the boundary of tractability to between increasing concave and increasing linear rate functions .",

    "clearly the reduction is polynomial .",
    "we provide several lemmas characterizing the optimum to the mpca instance .",
    "the first three lemmas use the following optimality conditions of single - user rate allocation ( e.g. , @xcite ) . first , for any user , the derivatives of the power function , evaluated at the allocated rates , are equal on all channels with positive rates .",
    "second , for channels not used , the function derivatives at zero rate are strictly higher than those of the used channels . for @xmath177 , where @xmath44 is the rate allocated and @xmath178 is the channel gain , the derivative @xmath179 .",
    "suppose that at optimum a clause user @xmath180 is allocated at least one invalid channel .",
    "assume @xmath180 is also allocated any valid channel , then the invalid channels carry zero rate , because putting the entire rate of 1.0 on the auxiliary channel , the function derivative is at most @xmath181 , whereas the function derivative for any invalid channel , at zero rate , is @xmath182 .",
    "thus the invalid channels can be eliminated from the allocation of @xmath180 .",
    "assume now the auxiliary channel is allocated to another user , say @xmath183 . by construction",
    ", the auxiliary channel of @xmath180 is invalid for @xmath183 . consider re - allocating any invalid channel of @xmath180 to @xmath183 , and allocating the auxiliary channel to @xmath180 .",
    "clearly , the total power will not increase . at this stage ,",
    "the remaining invalid channels allocated to @xmath180 carry zero flow . repeating the argument",
    ", we obtain an optimal allocation in which no clause user is allocated any invalid channel .",
    "let @xmath180 be any literal user and suppose it is allocated one or more invalid channels at optimum .",
    "if @xmath180 is allocated any of its four valid channels , the function derivative at rate 1.0 is at most @xmath184 , and therefore the invalid channels carry zero rate and can be removed from @xmath180 s allocation .",
    "assume therefore all four valid channels are allocated to other users .",
    "consider any literal channel of @xmath180 , and suppose it is allocated to user @xmath183 .",
    "for @xmath183 , this literal channel is an invalid one . swapping the allocation of the literal channel and any invalid channel currently allocated to @xmath180 ,",
    "the total power will not grow , and the remaining invalid channels allocated to @xmath180 can be released .",
    "the lemma follows from applying the procedure repeatedly .      putting the entire rate of 1.0 on the super - channel , the derivative value is @xmath185 . for any literal channel ,",
    "the derivative at zero rate is @xmath186 . that @xmath187 and @xmath188 lead to @xmath189 , and the result follows .      by the assumption of the lemma and lemma [ theo : epsilon ] , the literal user in question",
    "is allocated one , two , or all three of its literal channels , with total power @xmath190 , @xmath191 , and @xmath192 , respectively .",
    "note that , in the latter two cases , it is optimal to split the rate evenly because of the identical gain values .",
    "clearly , @xmath193 .",
    "we prove that cases one and two are not optimal .",
    "suppose that , at optimum , the literal user is allocated two of the literal channels .",
    "then the remaining literal channel is used to carry a strictly positive amount of flow of a clause user .",
    "consider modifying the solution by allocating all the three literal channels to the literal user , and letting the clause user use the auxiliary channel only .",
    "the power saving for the literal user is exactly @xmath194 , whereas the power increase for the clause user is less than @xmath195 .",
    "this contradicts the optimality assumption .",
    "hence case two is not optimal . since @xmath196 , a similar argument applies to case one , and the result follows .",
    "by lemmas [ theo : super][theo : literal ] , at optimum , a literal user will use either the super - channel only , or all the three literal channels . hence , for any literal in the 3-sat instance , either none or all of the corresponding three literal channels become blocked for the clause users .",
    "consequently , there is a unique mapping between a true / false variable assignment in the 3-sat instance and the availability of literal channels to the clause users in the mpca instance .",
    "the total power consumption of all the literal users equals exactly @xmath197 at optimum . in the remainder of the proof , we concentrate on the power consumption of the clause users .",
    "[ theo : max ] if every clause user is allocated at least one of the three literal channels corresponding to the literals in the clause in the 3-sat instance , then the total power for all clause users is at most @xmath153 .        by the assumption",
    ", at least one clause user is allocated the auxiliary channel only , with power @xmath195 .",
    "each of the other @xmath199 clause users is allocated at most four channels . assuming the availability of all four channels and setting @xmath200 leads to an under - estimation of the power consumption .",
    "the under - estimation has a total power of @xmath201 @xmath202 @xmath203 .    by lemmas [ theo :",
    "max]-[theo : min ] , the optimum power for the clause users is at most @xmath153 if and only if the answer is yes to the 3-sat instance .",
    "thus the recognition version of mpca is np - complete , and its optimization version is np - hard .      in the proof of theorem [ theo : nphard ] ,",
    "a 3-sat instance of @xmath152 variables and @xmath153 clauses is reduced to an mpca instance with @xmath204 users and @xmath205 channels , such that no user will be allocated more than three channels at optimum .",
    "we make an augmentation by adding @xmath159 channels , which we refer to as dummy channels .",
    "the channel gain of the dummy channels equals @xmath175 ( defined in the proof of theorem [ theo : nphard ] ) for all users . after the augmentation",
    ", there is a total of @xmath206 channels , organized in three blocks .",
    "the sequence of channels is as follows .",
    "the first block has @xmath207 channels , including the @xmath152 super - channels and the @xmath159 dummy channels , in a sequence of @xmath152 chunks of @xmath208 channels each .",
    "each chunk is composed by one super - channel and two dummy channels . the next block has the @xmath160 literal channels , with @xmath152 chunks having @xmath209 channels each .",
    "every chunk corresponds to a binary variable @xmath154 in the 3-sat instance , and the six literal channels appear in the order @xmath210 and @xmath211 .",
    "the third block contains the @xmath153 auxiliary channels .",
    "consider the resulting mpca instance with the restriction that , for the literal and clause users , respectively , the numbers of channels allocated per user are three and one . in addition , channel allocation must be consecutive in the given sequence .    to prove the hardness result , consider first a relaxation of the problem , in which the two restrictions of channel allocation are ignored for the literal users . for this relaxation ,",
    "it is clear that lemmas [ theo : epsilon]-[theo : literal ] remain valid . by lemma [ theo : epsilon ] and",
    "the signal - channel restriction of the clause users , each of these users will be allocated one of the four valid channels .",
    "obviously , the optimum is to allocate one literal channel , or the auxiliary channel if all the three literal channels are allocated to literal users .",
    "thus , as long as at least one literal channel is available to every clause user , the result of lemma [ theo : max ] holds . in addition , the validity of lemma [ theo : min ] obviously remains .",
    "therefore the optimum to the problem relaxation provides the correct answer to the 3-sat instance .    by lemma [ theo : literal ] , in the optimum of the relaxed problem , each literal user is either allocated its three consecutive literal channels , or the super - channel . in the latter case ,",
    "we modify the solution by allocating the two dummy channels accompanying the super - channel , without changing the total power . after the modification",
