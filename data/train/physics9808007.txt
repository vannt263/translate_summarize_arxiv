    "recently there has been rapid progress in techniques for trapping samples of neutral atoms at elevated densities and extremely low temperatures .",
    "the development of magnetic and optical traps for atoms has proceeded in parallel in recent years . while optical methods have proved to be an efficient means of cooling atoms to temperatures in the microkelvin range ,",
    "further progress is limited by interatomic interactions induced by the scattering of photons .",
    "the effort to attain higher densities and lower temperatures has therefore concentrated on the development of purely magnetic traps@xcite .",
    "such traps exploit the interaction of the magnetic moment of the atom with the inhomogeneous magnetic field to provide spatial confinement .",
    "microscopic particles are not the only candidates for magnetic traps . in fact",
    ", a vivid demonstration of trapping large - scale objects is the hovering magnetic top@xcite .",
    "this ingenious magnetic device , which hovers in mid - air for about 2 minutes , has been studied recently by several authors @xcite .",
    "the physical mechanism underlying the operation of magnetic traps is the adiabatic principle .",
    "the common way to describe their operation is in terms of _ classical _ mechanics : as the particle is released into the trap , its magnetic moment points antiparallel to the direction of the magnetic field . while inside the trap , the particle experiences lateral oscillations @xmath13 which are slow compared to its precession @xmath14 . under this condition",
    "the spin of the particle may be considered as experiencing a _ slowly _ rotating magnetic field .",
    "thus , the spin precesses around the _ local _ direction of the magnetic field @xmath5 ( adiabatic approximation ) and , on the average , its magnetic moment @xmath15 points _ antiparallel _ to the local magnetic field lines .",
    "hence , the magnetic energy , which is normally given by @xmath16 , is now given ( for small precession angle ) by @xmath17 .",
    "thus , the overall effective potential seen by the particle is @xmath18 in the adiabatic approximation , the spin degree of freedom is rigidly coupled to the translational degrees of freedom , and is already incorporated in eq.([energy ] ) .",
    "thus , under the adiabatic approximation , the particle may be considered as having only translational degrees of freedom . when the strength of the magnetic field possesses a _ _",
    "minimum _ _ , the effective potential becomes attractive near that minimum and the whole apparatus acts as a trap . to prevent spin - flip ( majorana transitions ) , most magneto - static traps include a bias field , so that the effective potential @xmath19 possesses a _ nonvanishing _ minimum .",
    "as mentioned above , the adiabatic approximation holds whenever @xmath20 . as @xmath14 is inversely proportional to the spin",
    ", this inequality can be satisfied provided that the spin of the particle is small enough .",
    "if , on the other hand , the spin of the particle is too large , it can not respond fast enough to the changes of the direction of the magnetic field . in this limit @xmath21",
    ", the spin has to be considered as fixed in space and , according to earnshaw s theorem@xcite , becomes unstable against _",
    "translations_.      the discussion of magnetic traps in the literature is , almost entirely , done in terms of _ classical _ mechanics . in microscopic systems , however , quantum effects become dominant , and in these cases _ quantum mechanics _ is suited for the description of the trap .",
    "an even more interesting issue is the understanding of how the classical and quantum descriptions of a _ given _ system are related . in this paper",
    "we study , both classically and quantum - mechanically , the quantitative nature of magnetic traps . in order to keep the underlying physics transparent",
    ", we devise a simplified model for the inhomogeneous magnetic field of such traps .",
    "we further neglect the effect of interactions between the particles in the trap and so we analyze the dynamics of a _ single _ particle inside the trap . for simplicity ,",
    "the particle is considered to have only a single translational degree of freedom .",
    "its spin degree of freedom , on the other hand , is taken completely into account .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in sec.[def ] we start by defining the system we study , together with useful parameters that will be used throughout this paper .",
    "next , we carry out a classical analysis of the problem in sec.[class ] . here , we find two stationary solutions for the particle inside the trap .",
    "one of them corresponds to a state whose spin is _ parallel _ to the direction of the magnetic field whereas the other one corresponds to a state whose spin is _ antiparallel _ to that direction . when considering the dynamical stability of these solutions , we find that only the _ antiparallel _ stationary solution is stable .",
    "we also study the same problem but with viscous friction added , and arrive at the interesting result that friction _",
    "destabilizes _ the system . in sec.[quant ] we reconsider the problem , from a quantum - mechanical point of view .",
    "here , we also find states that refer to _ parallel _ and _ antiparallel _ orientations of the spin , one of them being bound while the other one unbounded . in this case , however , these two states are _ coupled _ due to the inhomogeneity of the field , and we move on to calculate the _ lifetime _ of the bound state .",
    "finally , in sec.[dis ] we compare the results of the classical analysis with those of the quantum analysis and comment on their implications for practical magnetic traps .",
    "we consider a particle of mass @xmath1 , magnetic moment @xmath2 and intrinsic spin @xmath0 ( aligned with @xmath2 ) moving in 1d space in an inhomogeneous magnetic field @xmath5 given by @xmath22 this field possesses a nonzero minimum of amplitude at the origin , which is the essential part of the trap .",
    "note also that the direction of the field twists ( or curls ) as one moves along the @xmath23 axis .",
    "the hamiltonian for this system is@xmath24 where @xmath25 is the momentum of the particle .",
    "we define @xmath14 as the precessional frequency of the particle when it is at the origin @xmath26 .",
    "since at that point the magnetic field is @xmath27 we find that @xmath28 next , we define @xmath13 as the small - amplitude vibrational frequency of the particle when it is placed in the adiabatic potential field given by @xmath29 for this potential we have @xmath30 and therefore @xmath31 we also define the ratio between @xmath13 and @xmath14 , @xmath32 this will be our ` measure of adiabaticity ' .",
    "it is clear that as @xmath8 becomes smaller and smaller , the adiabatic approximation becomes more and more accurate .",
    "note also that @xmath8 is the only possibility to form a non - dimensional quantity ( up to an arbitrary power ) out of the parameters of the system .",
    "the value of @xmath8 therefore , completely determines the behavior of the system .",
    "we denote by @xmath33 a unit vector in the direction of the spin ( and the magnetic moment ) .",
    "thus , the equation of motion for the center of mass of the particle is @xmath34 and the evolution of its spin is determined by @xmath35 the two equilibrium solutions to eqs.([c1 ] ) and ( [ c2 ] ) are @xmath36 representing a motionless particle at the origin with its magnetic moment ( and spin ) pointing _ antiparallel _ ( @xmath37 ) to the direction of the field at that point and a similar solution but with the magnetic moment pointing _ parallel _ to the direction of the field ( @xmath38 ) .      to check the stability of these solutions we now add first - order perturbations .",
    "we set @xmath39 substitute these into eqs.([c1 ] ) and ( [ c2 ] ) , and retain only first - order terms .",
    "we find that the resulting equations for @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are @xmath43 we now look for oscillatory ( stable ) solutions for these equations . setting @xmath44 inside eqs.([c5 ] ) yields @xmath45{lll}% \\omega^{2 } & 0 & \\mu b_{\\bot}^{\\prime}/m\\\\ \\pm\\mu b_{\\bot}^{\\prime}/s & i\\omega & \\mu b_{0}/s\\\\ 0 & -\\mu b_{0}/s & i\\omega \\end{array } \\right )   } } \\cdot\\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{l}% x_{0}\\\\ \\epsilon_{x,0}\\\\ \\epsilon_{y,0}% \\end{array } \\right )   = \\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{l}% 0\\\\ 0\\\\ 0 \\end{array } \\right )   \\text{.}\\label{c8}%\\ ] ] this equation has non - trivial solutions whenever the determinant of the matrix @xmath46 vanishes",
    ". thus , the secular equation @xmath47 determines the eigenfrequencies @xmath48 of the various possible modes . when the _ lower _ sign is taken in eq.([c11 ] ) , corresponding to a spin _ parallel _ to the magnetic field , we find that one of the roots for @xmath49 is purely negative .",
    "this indicates that one of the roots for @xmath48 has a positive imaginary part for _ any _ @xmath8 and hence , the solution is unstable .",
    "we concentrate now on the other possible solution , corresponding to @xmath37 : here , the solutions for @xmath49 are given by @xmath50 for @xmath51 , the slow mode ( minus sign ) represents the vibration of the particle in the adiabatic potential , and the fast mode ( plus sign ) represents the precession of the spin about the @xmath52 component of the magnetic field , as is shown explicitly by the form of the eigenvectors .",
    "the general form of these eigenvectors may be written in terms of an arbitrary amplitude parameter @xmath53 as@xmath54{c}% \\delta x_{0}\\\\ \\epsilon_{x,0}\\\\ \\epsilon_{y,0}% \\end{array } \\right )   = \\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{c}% \\dfrac{b_{0}}{b_{\\perp}^{\\prime}}\\left (   \\dfrac{\\omega_{vib}}{\\omega}\\right ) ^{2}\\\\",

    "furthermore , the ratio @xmath56 shows that the amplitudes @xmath57 and @xmath58 are related in such a manner that the direction of the spin is _ antiparallel _ to the direction of the local magnetic field .",
    "eq.([c12.03 ] ) for the precessional mode tells us that the amplitude of the translational motion of the particle is negligible , thus in this mode the particle is essentially fixed and its spin precesses around the direction of the magnetic field at the origin .    due to the coupling between the translational and the precessional degrees of freedom , the mode frequencies given in eq.([c12 ] ) , change with increasing @xmath8 .",
    "a stable solution requires that all mode frequencies @xmath48 be real .",
    "consequently , stability means that the roots for @xmath49 are real and positive . from eq.([c12 ] ) we find that this happens when @xmath59 for the following discussion it is also useful to note that in the region @xmath6 , @xmath60    fig.[fig1 ] shows the real and imaginary parts of the frequencies @xmath48 of the two modes as a function of @xmath8 .",
    "we note that when @xmath6 , the imaginary parts of both frequencies vanish , indicating a stable solution .",
    "the mode with the lower frequency goes asymptotically to @xmath61 when @xmath51 .",
    "this is the _ vibrational _ mode .",
    "the mode corresponding to the higher frequency , goes asymptotically to @xmath62 as @xmath51 .",
    "this is the _ precessional _ mode whose frequency , as we mentioned earlier , is inversely proportional to the spin .",
    "when @xmath63 , both solutions for @xmath49 possess an imaginary part and the system becomes unstable .",
    "[ p ]      the excitation energy of a given mode is defined as the difference between the energy of the mode and the energy of the stationary state,@xmath64 note that the energy is bilinear in the coordinates and hence , one can not neglect the @xmath65-component of the spin .",
    "instead , one must set@xmath66 thus , the correct expression of the energy for small amplitudes is@xmath67 in this expression , the modes have to be written in real form,@xmath68@xmath69@xmath70 substituting eqs.([ec2 ] ) , ( [ ec3 ] ) and ( [ ec4 ] ) into eq.([ec1.2 ] ) and using eq.([c11 ] ) one finds that@xmath71 using eq.([c13.1 ] ) we conclude that for @xmath72 , the excitation energy of the vibrational mode is _ positive _ while the excitation energy of the precessional mode is always _",
    "negative_. at the point @xmath73 , where the two modes coalesce , the excitation energy vanishes",
    ". we will further refer to these observations in the following section .",
    "when friction is introduced into the system , the equations of motion become @xmath74 and @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are translational and precessional friction coefficients , respectively . the second term on the right - hand side of eq.([fric2 ] )",
    "is the spin - damping contributed by the _ change _ in the direction of the spin from @xmath33 to @xmath78 . since , by definition , @xmath33 is a unit vector , @xmath79 is perpendicular to @xmath33 .",
    "thus , @xmath80 is the angular velocity associated with the change of @xmath33 .",
    "since the direction of @xmath81 must be perpendicular to both @xmath79 and @xmath33 we form the cross product @xmath82 which incorporates both the correct value and the right direction .",
    "multiplying @xmath83 by @xmath77 yields the spin - damping term .",
    "to first order in @xmath84 and @xmath76 the secular equation in this case is given by@xmath85 @xmath86 where we defined@xmath87 to make the expression simple .",
    "let @xmath88 be the eigenfrequencies @xmath89 of the frictionless problem , given by eq.([c11 ] ) .",
    "when adding a small friction to the problem , the eigenfrequencies will change by a small amount @xmath90 .",
    "we find an approximate expression for @xmath91 by expanding eq.([fric3 ] ) around @xmath88 to first order in @xmath90 and making use of eq.([c11 ] ) .",
    "this gives @xmath92    eq.([fric4 ] ) has an interesting consequence : from eq.([c13.1 ] ) we find that the numerator in eq.([fric4 ] ) is positive for both modes while the denominator is negative for the vibrational mode and positive for the precessional mode . we therefore conclude that friction , either translational or precessional , stabilizes the vibrational motion and , simultaneously , destabilizes the precessional motion .",
    "the system all together becomes of course , _",
    "unstable_.    the fact that spin damping leads to an exponential growth of the fast mode is no surprise in view of its negative excitation energy . also , the exponential decay of the slow mode due to translational friction is to be expected on account of its positive excitation energy .",
    "what _ is _ important is the fact that due to the coupling between translation and precession , _ translational _ friction causes an exponential growth of the _ fast _ mode , with a growth time which , compared to the effect of spin damping , is smaller by a factor of @xmath93 in the limit of small @xmath8 .",
    "in this section we consider the problem of a neutral particle with spin @xmath7 in a 1d inhomogeneous magnetic field from a quantum - mechanical point of view . unlike the classical analysis , in which the derivation was valid for any value of the adiabaticity parameter @xmath8",
    ", we concentrate here on the behavior of the system when @xmath8 is _",
    "small_. we choose to analyze the case of a spin @xmath94  particle because this case already shows the essentials of the quantum - mechanical problem .",
    "now , it is convenient to express the dependence of the magnetic field on @xmath23 in terms of its amplitude @xmath95 and its direction @xmath96 with respect to the @xmath52 axis",

    "this term can be calculated by temporarily introducing suitable boundary conditions : assume that the system is bounded by an infinite potential wall at @xmath187 , the length @xmath188 being large compared to @xmath162 yet small when compared to @xmath189 . in this case , the uniform potential approximation still holds , and we may use the well - known result for the density of states for a particle in a 1d infinite potential well,@xmath190 the evaluation of the normalization constant @xmath191 gives@xmath192 and therefore@xmath193    finally , using eqs.([t13 ] ) and ( [ t8 ] ) inside eq.([t1 ] ) gives @xmath194   = t_{vib}\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{\\left (   2\\pi\\right )   ^{3}k}}% \\exp\\left [   \\dfrac{1}{2k}\\right ]   , \\label{t14}%\\ ] ] where @xmath195 is the period of classical oscillations inside the trap .",
    "looking back at the calculation of the matrix element , eq.([t8 ] ) , one realizes that for small @xmath8 the wave function @xmath196 oscillates strongly in the region where the wave function @xmath197 is essentially different from zero . thus",
    ", successive subintervals compensate each other very effectively , and it is possible that the regions @xmath198 where the @xmath23-dependence of the potential becomes important , contribute more effectively to the integral than the simple estimates indicate . we have therefore carried out a more accurate calculation , using the wkb approximation@xcite , which takes the @xmath23-dependence of the potential into account .",
    "the calculation , which is given in the appendix , yields the result @xmath199 \\label{t15}%\\ ] ] which does indeed differ from eq.([t14 ] ) not only by the prefactor , being unity in eq.([t14 ] ) and @xmath200 in eq.([t15 ] ) , but even by the exponent which is @xmath201 in eq.([t14 ] ) and @xmath202 in eq.([t15 ] ) .",
    "summarizing all we have found we conclude that the problem we have studied has three important time scales : the shortest time scale is @xmath203 , which is the time required for _ one _ precession of the spin around the axis of the local magnetic field .",
    "the intermediate time scale is @xmath204 , which is the time required to complete one cycle of the center of mass around the center of the trap .",
    "these two time scales appear both in the classical and the quantum - mechanical analysis .",
    "the longest time scale ( provided @xmath8 is small ) @xmath9 , which is not present in the classical problem , is the time it takes for the particle to escape from the trap .    whereas the classical analysis yields an upper bound of @xmath73 for trapping to occur , no such sharp bound exists in the quantum - mechanical analysis .",
    "this is related to the fact that one can not associate an effective potential well with a finite barrier with the system .",
    "nevertheless it is interesting to compare the classical bound with the value of @xmath8 for which the exponent in the expression for the quantum - mechanical lifetime becomes equal to @xmath205 : for the uniform - field approximation , eq.([t14 ] ) , the two values happen to agree exactly , and in the wkb approximation , eq.([t15 ] ) , they differ only by a small amount .",
    "thus , the quantum - mechanical condition for trapping to occur is essentially the same as the classical condition .    as an example",
    ", we apply our results to the case of a neutron and an atom trapped with a field @xmath206 oe and @xmath207 cm .",
    "these parameters correspond to typical traps used in bose - einstein condensation experiments@xcite .",
    "the results , being correct to within an order of magnitude , are outlined in the following table : @xmath208{|c||c|c|}\\hline & \\multicolumn{2}{||c|}{$% \\begin{array } [ c]{c}% b_{0}=100\\text { oe}\\\\ b_{0}/b_{\\bot}^{\\prime}=10\\text{cm}% \\end{array } $ } \\\\\\cline{2 - 3}% & neutron & atom\\\\\\hline $ m$ gr & $ \\sim10^{-25}$ & $ \\sim10^{-22}$\\\\\\hline $ \\mu$ emu & $ \\sim10^{-23}$ & $ \\sim10^{-20}$\\\\\\hline $ k$ & $ \\sim10^{-5}$ & $ \\sim10^{-8}$\\\\\\hline $ t_{prec}$ sec & $ \\sim10^{-6}$ & $ \\sim10^{-9}$\\\\\\hline $ t_{vib}$ sec & $ \\sim10^{-1}$ & $ \\sim10^{-1}$\\\\\\hline $ t_{esc}$ sec & $ \\sim10^{\\left (   10^{4}\\right )   } $ & $ \\sim10^{\\left ( 10^{7}\\right )   } $ \\\\\\hline \\end{tabular}\\ ] ] we note that in both cases @xmath8 is very small compared to @xmath205 .",
    "consequently , the calculated lifetime of the particle in the trap is extremely large , suggesting that the particle ( either neutron or atom ) is tightly trapped in this field .    though the toy model presented in this paper is very simple , preliminary studies@xcite show that behavior similar to what we found in this model trap appears also in more realistic magnetic traps such as those used in bose - einstein condensation experiments .",
    "for example , a similar analysis of a two - dimensional ioffee trap@xcite shows similar behavior when the classical analysis and quantum - mechanical analysis are compared , but in this case we find that @xmath209   $ ] .",
    "the problem studied in this paper deals with a spin @xmath94 particle .",
    "though this fact has little influence on the solution of the _ classical _ problem , the extension to higher spin values complicates the analysis of the _ quantum - mechanical _ problem . in this case one",
    "has to deal with a ( @xmath210)-component spinor , and the interaction hamiltonian does no longer connect the ( @xmath211)-state to the ( @xmath212)-state , but only to the ( @xmath213 ) and ( @xmath214 ) states which for @xmath215 will _ still _ be trapped .",
