    "<S> this heating configuration shifts the embedded microring resonances at a rate of 9.5 ghz / mw while a spurious shift of the outer ring resonance occurs at a rate of 1.5 ghz / mw due to a small thermal crosstalk . to accurately measure the spurious shift we used a spectral region ( not shown in fig . </S>",

    "<S> 3d , solid line ) are well reproduced . </S>",
    "<S> this good agreement indicates that the small resonance shift observed in the experimental data is dominated by mode anti - crossing dispersion caused by the repuslion of the outer ring resonance by the embedded ring resonances .    </S>",
