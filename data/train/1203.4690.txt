    "bayesian analysis has long been a major methodological vehicle for implementation of shrinkage ideas in complex scenarios .",
    "there are two primary ways in which such shrinkage is implemented .",
    "the first is through use of prior distributions which shrink the unknowns in some fashion  to prespecified locations or prespecified subspaces , depending on the problem and type of prior .",
    "thus an unknown normal mean could be shrunk toward a specified prior mean ; a collection of unknown normal means could be shrunk toward the hyperplane in which the means are equal ; and an unknown real function could be shrunk toward the subspace of monotonic functions .",
    "this is the bayesian version of the type of shrinkage originating with @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the second major bayesian vehicle for shrinkage is bayesian variable selection , which sets some of the unknown parameters to zero .",
    "this is often an overly drastic shrinkage , but is certainly not so in the context of model selection , or in the context of nonparametric function estimation . in the latter setting ,",
    "the unknown parameters that are set to zero are typically coefficients of basis elements from a basis representation of the function , and sparsity considerations strongly encourage such shrinkage .        both of these shrinkage concepts are herein utilized in nonparametric function estimation with dependent wavelets .",
    "the motivating application is to cepheid variable stars and is described in the next subsection ; the functions to be estimated can have arbitrary shapes , but are quite smooth .",
    "it is to induce sufficient smoothness that will utilize both types of shrinkage discussed above .",
    "there is a class of stars , called cepheid variables , that pulsate with a regular and distinctive periodic signature .",
    "the stars actually grow larger and then smaller , and as a result their luminosities vary periodically along with their colors . since there is a  physical relationship between the star s linear diameter , its luminosity , and its color ,",
    "there are actually two independent periodically varying quantities .",
    "a very interesting and useful property of these stars is that their mean luminosities are highly correlated with their pulsation period , in that the shorter - period stars are less luminous than the longer - period ones .",
    "this is very well approximated as a linear relation between the log of the period and the log of the luminosity . as a consequence ,",
    "if one knows the slope and intercept of this relationship , and measures the period of a cepheid ( which is trivial ) , one can infer the luminosity with quite high precision .",
    "this makes these stars very useful as `` standard candles , '' because knowledge of a star s luminosity as well as its observed brightness allows us to compute the distance from the inverse square law .",
    "knowing the distance to the individual cepheid also gives us the distance to the galaxy or cluster of stars in which it is embedded .",
    "thus , these stars are fundamental in setting the distance scale of the universe .",
    "the most challenging feature of the problem statistically is that the key photometry and radial velocity curves for a star are unknown , and have no simple structure . in @xcite ,",
    "fourier polynomials of finite ( but unknown ) degree were used to represent these two curves .",
    "for instance , figure [ tmon ] presents the data concerning the radial velocity of the surface of the star t moncerotis , at various phases of the star s period ( the actual data are indicated by the @xmath0 s ) together with a fifth - order trigonometric polynomial fit to the data . because of the possibility of quite arbitrary shapes for the photometry and velocity curves for cepheid variable stars , we instead desired to model the curves via much more flexible wavelet decompositions .",
    "posterior inference in this setup is formally equivalent to variable selection in a normal linear regression problem with massively many candidate covariates .",
    "posterior simulation requires averaging and/or selection across alternative models defined by the set of basis functions ( wavelets ) which are included in the model . in the context of normal - linear regression ,",
    "common approaches are guided search in the model space using the occam s window principle ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ; markov chain monte carlo simulation across the model space ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ; and importance sampling or gibbs sampling based on analytic approximations to the marginal posterior distribution on the model indicator ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "see , for example , @xcite , hoeting et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) and @xcite for reviews . in this paper",
    "we introduce a scheme for fast posterior simulation across the model space , marginalizing over the wavelet coefficients .",
    "we use a computational strategy similar to that used by @xcite and @xcite to allow fast computation of marginal model probabilities when considering models differing by only one wavelet basis function .",
    "wavelet decomposition allows representation of any square integrable function @xmath1 as @xmath2 here @xmath3 and @xmath4 are wavelets and scaling functions at level of detail @xmath5 and shift @xmath6 . in the context of statistical modeling , ( [ eqdwt ] )",
    "allows for inference about random functions by defining a probability model for the coefficients @xmath7 @xmath8 , that is , ( [ eqdwt ] ) provides a parameterization of a random function @xmath9 in terms of the wavelet coefficients @xmath10 .",
    "see , for example , @xcite or ferreira and lee ( @xcite ) , chapter  5 , for a review of wavelet representations relevant for statistical modeling.=1    perhaps the most common application of ( [ eqdwt ] ) in  statistical modeling is to nonlinear regression where  @xmath1 represents the unknown mean response @xmath11 for an observation @xmath12 with covariate @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and abramovich , angelini and de  canditiis ( @xcite ) , among many others , discuss bayesian inference in such models assuming equally spaced data , that is , covariate values @xmath14 are on a regular grid . for equally spaced data",
    "the discrete wavelet transformation is orthogonal . together with assuming independent measurement errors and a priori independent wavelet coefficients this leads to posterior independence of the @xmath15 .",
    "thus the problem essentially reduces to a sequence of univariate problems , one for each wavelet coefficient .",
    "see , for example , @xcite for a review .",
    "generalizations of wavelet techniques to non - equidistant ( nes ) design impose additional conceptual and computational burdens .",
    "a reasonable approximation is to bin observations in equally spaced bins and proceed as in the equally spaced case .",
    "if only few observations are missing to complete an equally spaced grid , treating these few as missing data leads to efficient implementations ( antoniadis ,  grgoire and mckeague ( @xcite ) ; @xcite ) .",
    "we propose instead an approachwhich does not depend on posterior independence .",
    "our approach includes informative dependent priors with positive prior probabilities for vanishing wavelet coefficients.=1",
    "because of the wavelet representation that will be used , a function space prior can be defined by considering the function at the discrete points @xmath16 , where @xmath17 .",
    "letting @xmath18 , consider the difference process @xmath19 .",
    "a function space prior that `` shrinks towardsmoothness '' can be defined by imposing positive  correlations on the @xmath20 .",
    "specifically , let @xmath21 , and define the prior to be @xmath22 with @xmath23 ; that is , we assume a multivariate normal prior with scale parameter @xmath24 and log correlations proportional to distance .",
    "let @xmath25 denote the left upper @xmath26 submatrix of @xmath27 and partition @xmath27 into @xmath28.\\ ] ] let @xmath29 .",
    "assuming @xmath30 we find @xmath31 with @xmath32 , @xmath33,\\\\ h_0 & = & \\left [ \\matrix { \\sigma^2_0 & 0 \\vspace*{2pt}\\cr 0 & h } \\right ] \\quad\\mbox{and}\\\\ h & = & \\delta_{(11)}-\\delta_{(12 ) } \\delta_{(12)}'/v .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in view of the normalization property , @xmath34 , scaling coefficients at the highest level of detail @xmath35 are approximately proportional to the represented function , @xmath36 .",
    "therefore the multivariate normal prior on @xmath37 implies @xmath38 where @xmath39 .",
    "following common practice in the use of wavelet decomposition , we will ignore the proportionality constant @xmath40 and assume @xmath41 as long as we also drop @xmath40 in the reconstruction of @xmath1 , ignoring the proportionality constant will leave the final inference unchanged .",
    "the prior @xmath42 implies a dependent multivariate normal prior for the vector of all wavelet coefficients @xmath43 @xmath44 in principle @xmath45 can be found by explicitly computing the linear operator of the wavelet decomposition . but from a computational point of view this is unnecessary and undesirable .",
    "instead @xcite show how @xmath45 can be derived from @xmath46 as a bivariate wavelet decomposition of @xmath46 .",
    "one of the important advantages of wavelet bases over alternative bases for @xmath47 functions is the parsimony property of wavelet representations .",
    "reasonably regular functions are well approximated with only few nonzero wavelet coefficients .",
    "therefore``shrinkage toward smoothness '' can also be induced by setting many of the wavelet coefficients to be zero .",
    "we thus assume positive prior probability for vanishing wavelet coefficients .",
    "let @xmath48 denote the vector of indices of nonzero wavelet coefficients , that is , @xmath49 iff @xmath50 .",
    "we define a prior distribution on @xmath51 with geometrically decreasing probability for nonzero wavelet coefficients in higher levels of detail @xmath5 : @xmath52 see , for example , @xcite for a discussion of the choice of @xmath53 .",
    "we write @xmath54 for the subvector of nonzero wavelet coefficients @xmath15 , and we use @xmath55 for the full model which includes all coefficients @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the prior @xmath58 for the wavelet coefficients under model @xmath51 is implied from  ( [ eq1 ] ) by conditioning the multivariate normal on @xmath59 , .",
    "let @xmath60 and write @xmath61 for the submatrix with rows and columns @xmath62 . then @xmath63 we use @xmath45 to generically denote @xmath64 , suppressing the dependence on @xmath51 to simplify notation .",
    "figures [ figprior ] and [ figprior9 ] demonstrate the `` shrinkage toward smoothness '' behavior of the priors in sections  [ secsubspace ] and  [ secsparsity ] . the figures give realizations from the priors specified in the two subsections .",
    "figure  [ figprior ] utilizes @xmath65 from the prior in section  [ secsubspace ] and figure  [ figprior9 ] utilizes @xmath66 .",
    "the smaller @xmath67 induces much more dependence , clearly resulting in smoother functions .",
    "the left panel of each figure is generated from use of only the prior in section [ secsubspace ] , that is , all the wavelet coefficients are kept .",
    "in contrast , the right panels of each figure show what happens when many of the wavelet coefficients are set to zero .",
    "( for simplicity , these were produced using a standard wavelet thresholding rule . ) clearly , setting many wavelet coefficients to zero does seem to result in considerable additional shrinkage toward smoothness .",
    "we implement posterior inference using markov chain monte carlo simulation .",
    "marginalizing over  @xmath54 , we use the posterior probabilities @xmath68 to define a  metropolis  hastings scheme which proposes moves in the model space by adding or deleting one wavelet basis function at a time .",
    "the computational effort of the proposed scheme is comparable to that of @xcite and @xcite , who suggest schemes based on algorithms by @xcite and ( @xcite ) which allow fast updating of a choleski decomposition of the cross - product matrix @xmath69 .",
