    "thermally activated vortex - like excitations ( topological defects ) of the superconducting condensate is the primary source of dissipation in mesoscopic superconducting structures .",
    "these fluctuations take different forms in one - dimensional ( 1d ) and two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems . in 2d thin films",
    "the fluctuations are known to be broken vortex - antivortex pairs @xcite while in 1d wires the resistance is due to phase slips.@xcite one important difference between these two types of fluctuations is that vortices and antivortices form bound pairs below a certain critical temperature , known as the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition temperature , while phase slips and anti - phase - slips are unbound at any finite temperature .",
    "thus the resistance of 1d wires is greater than zero at any finite temperature due to the presence of phase slips , which are described by the theory of langer , ambegaokar , mccumber , and halperin ( lamh ) , @xcite    here we report a study of structures in which both types of fluctuations can coexist , namely thin films containing constrictions , which are comparable in size to the coherence length .",
    "the goals of this work are ( i ) to test the applicability of the lamh theory for short and rather wide constrictions and ( ii ) to test the effect of the vortex - antivortex sea existing in the thin film banks adjacent to the constriction on the phase slippage rate on the constriction itself .",
    "for this purpose we fabricate and measure a series of thin superconducting moge films@xcite ( which are about 15 @xmath5 m wide ) interrupted by constrictions or `` bridges '' ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sample]a ) .",
    "the width of the narrowest point of the bridges is in the range of 13 - 28 nm , i.e. a few times larger than the coherence length ( we estimate @xmath6 nm for our moge films@xcite ) .",
    "two resistive transitions are observed in such samples indicating that vortex - antivortex pair binding - unbinding transition ( if any ) and thermally activated phase slip processes occur separately .",
    "for @xmath7 the contribution of vortex - antivortex pairs is dominant . on the other hand , below @xmath8",
    "the transport properties are determined by the phase slip process on the bridge , which may be regarded as a vortex - antivortex pair breaking assisted by the bridge .    using direct and indirect techniques",
    "we have tracked the sample s resistance within a range of eleven orders of magnitude .",
    "the resulting @xmath0 curves are compared with the lamh theory .",
    "regardless of the large width of the bridges and their shortness , the shape of the measured @xmath0 curves is in perfect agreement with the overall shape of the curves computed using the standard lamh theory ( note that this theory was originally derived for very long wires that are much thinner than the coherence length ) .",
    "the only disagreement found with lamh is that the pre - exponential factor had to be modified in order to obtain a reasonably low critical temperature of the bridges .",
    "( the critical temperature is used as an adjustable parameter in the fitting procedure . ) following the argument of little@xcite we arrive at the conclusion that the pre - exponential factor should be simply @xmath4 and obtain a good agreement with measured curves .",
    "the measurements show that the bridges with intermediate dimensions ( i ) allow phase slippage which does not quench at any finite temperature , ( ii ) behave independently of the thin film banks , and ( iii ) exhibit a higher rate of phase slippage in the cases when the width of the bridge is smaller and therefore when the coupling between the thin film banks is weaker .    before presenting our experimental results we give a brief summary of the bkt theory of topological phase transitions and the lamh theory of thermally activated phase slips . in thin superconducting films , even in the absence of a magnetic field , an equal population of free vortices and antivortices is expected to occur .",
    "the bkt theory predicts a universal jump in the film superfluid density @xmath9 at the characteristic temperature @xmath8 , lower than the mean field critical temperature of the film @xmath10 .",
    "such a jump is related to the vortex - antivortex pair binding through a logarithmic interaction potential between free vortices @xcite .",
    "applied currents can break bound pairs producing free vortices and leading to non - linear @xmath11 curves .",
    "above @xmath8 the linear resistance of a film is given by the halperin - nelson ( hn ) formula@xcite @xmath12}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the normal state resistance per square of the film and @xmath14 is a non - universal constant .",
    "note that the hn equation predicts zero resistance for temperatures below the bkt phase transition temperature @xmath8 .",
    "the lamh theory@xcite applies to narrow superconducting channels , in which thermal fluctuations can cause phase slips , i.e. jumps by @xmath15 of the phase difference of the superconducting order parameter . in unbiased samples the number of phase slips ( which change the phase difference by @xmath16 ) equals the number of anti - phase - slips ( which change the phase difference by @xmath17 ) .",
    "an applied bias current pushes the system away from the equilibrium and the number of phase slips becomes larger than the number of anti - phase - slips .",
    "thus a net voltage appears on the sample , which can be calculated , following lamh , as @xmath18 ( below we will also discuss an alternative approach to the voltage definition ) .",
    "here @xmath19 is planck s constant , @xmath20 is the electron charge , and @xmath21 is the rate of change of the phase difference between the ends of the wire . during the phase slip process the energy of the system increases since the order parameter becomes suppressed to zero in the center of the phase slip .",
    "thermal activations of the system over this free energy barrier @xmath22 occur at a rate given by @xmath23 .",

    "the attempt frequency is inversely proportional to the relaxation time @xmath32 of the time - dependent gl theory , with @xmath33 being the mean field critical temperature of the wire ( or of the bridge , as in our discussions below ) .",
    "the factor @xmath34 provides a correction for the overlap of fluctuations at different places of the wire and the factor @xmath30 gives the number of statistically independent regions in the wire@xcite .",

    "below we analyze the resistive tails found on samples with constrictions and demonstrate that they are caused by the phase slip events localized on the bridges and behave independently of the adjacent thin film banks .",
    "the analysis indicates that no bkt ( no vortex - antivortex binding within the constrictions ) or any other type of transition occurs on the constrictions and that the phase slips and anti - phase - slips are unpaired at any nonzero temperature due to thermal fluctuations .",
    "this is demonstrated below by fitting the @xmath0 curves with the lamh - like fitting curves .      in order to compare our results to the lamh we have to take into account the small length of the bridge , which does not allow more than one phase slip at a give time .",
    "therefore the attempt frequency @xmath67 of eq . can be simplified .",
    "first , it has a term @xmath30 that accounts for the number of independent sites where a phase slip can occur .",
    "since each of our samples has only one narrow region where phase slip events can happen , we take @xmath68 .",
    "second , the coefficient @xmath69 which takes into account possible overlaps of phase slips at different places along the wire@xcite is taken to be unity also .",
    "this is because for short hyperbolic bridges ( not much longer than the coherence length ) it is reasonable to expect that there is only one spot , i.e. the narrowest point of the bridge , where phase slips occur . as a result",
    ", we obtain the attempt frequency for a short hyperbolic bridge @xmath70 ( the abbreviation `` wl '' stands for `` weak link '' ) .",
    "this attempt frequency can be combined with the usual form of the lamh resistance in eq . and can be used to fit the experimental @xmath0 curves ( below the resistive transition of the films ) .",
    "although such fits follow the data very well , there is one inconsistency that is they require the critical temperature of the bridge to be chosen higher than the critical temperature of the films , which is unphysical for such system .",
    "we attempt to modify the pre - exponential factor in order to resolve this inconsistency , as discussed below .",
    "[ h ]      since the exact expression is unknown , we approximate the resistance of a constriction ( weak link ) as @xmath71 the exponential factor here is that of the lamh theory and the prefactor is simply the normal resistance of the bridge . this expression ( eq . ) can be justified by the following argument : the duration of a single phase slip ( i.e. the time it takes for the order parameter to recover ) is @xmath72 and the number of phase slips occurring per second is @xmath73}$ ] , with the attempt frequency being the inverse gl relaxation time @xmath70 , as was argued above .",
    "therefore the time fraction during which the constriction is experiencing a phase slip ( i.e. when superconductivity is suppressed on the bridge ) is the product of these two values , i.e. @xmath74 } =   { \\text{exp } \\left [ -\\delta f(t)/kt \\right]}$ ] .",
    "following little,@xcite it can be assumed that the bridge has the normal resistance @xmath4 during the time when a phase slip is present ( i.e. when the bridge is in the normal state ) , and the resistance is zero otherwise ( when there is no phase slip ) .",
    "thus we arrive at the averaged resistance for a bridge or a small size weak link @xmath75}$ ] as in eq . .",
    "note that unlike in the lamh theory , in the present formulation the fluctuation resistance is directly linked to to the normal state resistance of the sample .    in order to compare eq . to the experimental results ,",
    "an explicit expression for the energy barrier @xmath76 for a phase slip localized on the bridge is required . starting with the usual form@xcite derived for a long 1d wire and some well known results from bcs and gl theory , we find that @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the length of the wire .",
    "using @xmath79 , the free energy barrier for a weak link is @xmath80 where @xmath56 is the width of the bridge , @xmath60 is the film thickness , @xmath81 is the normal resistivity , and @xmath82 .",
    "the parameter @xmath61 measures the ratio of the phase slip length along the bridge to the effective length of a phase slip in a 1d wire , which is equal to @xmath83 .",

    "an impressively good agreement is found for all five samples . in particular ,",
    "sample b1 measured using the low - temperature transformer , shows an agreement with the predicted resistance @xmath86 over about seven orders of magnitude , down to a temperature that is more than two times lower compared to the critical temperature of the sample .",

    "this fact supports the validity of eq . .",
    "such good agreement also indicates that the dissipation in a thin film with a constriction at @xmath66 is solely due to thermal activation of phase slips on constrictions .",
    "as expected , @xmath90 for all samples and the larger @xmath61 values are found on wider constrictions .",

    "[ fig : dvdi ] it is clear that at @xmath92 and sufficiently low currents the dependence of the differential resistance on bias current is exponential ( it appears linear on the log - linear plots ) .",

    "an excellent agreement is seen in a wide range of resistances spanning _ eleven orders of magnitude_. this re - confirms that the thermally activated phase slip mechanism is dominant in the bridge samples@xcite for @xmath66 .",
    "we emphasize that the critical temperature of the bridge , which is used as an adjustable parameter , is found to be @xmath96 k. as expected , the @xmath33 of the bridge is slightly lower than the critical temperature of the film electrodes @xmath63 k.

    "the overall shape of the fitting curve ( dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : diff_res ] ) agrees with the data as well as with the @xmath86 fit .",
    "the drawback of the usual lamh formula is that the critical temperature of the bridge , which is used as an adjustable parameter , turns out considerably higher than the film transition temperature .",
    "for example , the dashed line fit in fig .",
    "[ fig : diff_res ] is generated using @xmath98 k which is larger than the film critical temperature @xmath63 k. this apparent enhancement of the critical temperature of the bridge must be an artifact , because a reduction of the dimensions of moge samples always leads to a reduction of the critical temperature.@xcite on the other hand , the @xmath33 extracted from the fits made using eq .",
    "are almost equal and slightly lower than the film @xmath10 ( table i ) , as expected .    a rapid decrease of the lamh resistance at temperatures very close to the critical temperature reflects the behavior of the lamh attempt frequency which approaches zero as @xmath99 .",
