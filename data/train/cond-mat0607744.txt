    "understanding and controlling charge injection and removal in organic electronic devices is a problem of great interest , from the basic physics of the metal / organic interface to the practical need for optimized device performance .",
    "contact resistances in inorganic semiconductor devices are typically minimized by strong local doping of the contact regions .",
    "the high local carrier concentration is intended to reduce the depletion length sufficiently to thin any schottky barrier to effective transparency .",
    "local doping of organic semiconductors ( oscs ) in fets and organic light - emitting diodes ( oleds ) is very challenging , particularly in solution - processable devices .",
    "figure  [ fig : diagram ] shows the basic situation , and makes clear why this is a complicated problem .",
    "polymer oscs are generally highly disordered , and charge transport through these materials occurs via variable range hopping through a strongly energy dependent density of localized states@xcite .",
    "the detailed microstructure of the osc can drastically affect transport properties , with increasing microscopic order generally correlating with higher charge mobilities .",
    "for the case of hole injection as shown , one can define a schottky barrier height as the energetic difference between the fermi level of the metal electrode and the center of the valence band of the osc .",
    "this energetic alignment depends critically on the details of the metal / osc interface .",
    "a detailed treatment of this problem in the absence of significant metal / osc charge transfer has been presented by arkhipov _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "no complete theoretical picture of this process has been developed .",
    "in addition to the metal / osc interface , the osc / dielectric interface is also of critical importance in ofets , thanks to its influence on the osc microstructure and proximity to the accumulated charge , which is typically confined to a channel only a few nanometers thick adjacent to that surface .    [",
    "cols=\"^ \" , ]     figure  [ fig : nano1 ] shows an interesting comparison of devices with channel lengths @xmath0  100  nm , @xmath1 m .",
    "these ofets have been prepared with a two - stage e - beam lithography process with surfaces cleaned as before , with no annealing beyond 2 hours in vacuum .",
    "the au - only device is highly nonlinear already .",
    "the devices based on ope - f sam - treated au electrodes and pt electrodes , however , have nearly identical functional forms of @xmath2 vs. @xmath3 , both starting with an ohmic region extending to an average source / drain electric field approaching @xmath4  v / m .",
    "previously measured contact resistivities in larger devices made from the same electrode materials suggest that these devices are contact limited , and like those in sect .  [",
    "sect : ohmic ] are manifesting ohmic contact resistances . because of the diffusion - limited injection picture it is still possible that the slight superlinear dependence of @xmath5 in those two devices is a manifestation of the intrinsic field - dependence of @xmath6 ( see hamadani and natelson ( 2004)@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these measurements are preliminary .",
    "experiments are ongoing with shorter channel lengths and al gates with native al@xmath7o@xmath8 gate dielectrics for improved gate coupling",
    ". other techniques including electromigration@xcite are under consideration for enabling single - molecule level measurements .",
    "using such deeply scaled devices as tools to understand basic device physics is just beginning .",
    "injection and contact effects in ofets remain rich and important topics of investigation . as described above , even restricting experiments to a small part of the possible parameter space of electrode materials , device geometries , osc materials , and surface preparations",
    "has revealed a wealth of information .",
    "simple pictures of injection based on inorganic devices appear to be inadequate to explain the observed features of polymer ofets in the general case of a significant energetic mismatch between the electrode fermi level and the osc electronic structure . under certain circumstances it is possible to extract the current / voltage characteristics of the metal / osc interface , and the resulting data constrain models of the injection process .",
    "surface - sensitive spectroscopies are essential tools for understanding the energetics of the metal / osc interface , and there is significant indirect evidence that electrode work function and ( unintentional ) osc doping level can strongly affect the injection mechanism .",
    "surface chemistry provides a means of engineering desirable injection properties through the use of dipolar sams to alter the metal energetics .",
    "finally , sub-100  nm channel length ofets are going to be very useful tools for further investigations of basic device physics questions .",
    "much remains to be learned about the interfacial physics and chemistry issues relevant to these problems .",
    "future developments in theory and experimental tools for accessing buried interfaces prepared under realistic ( non - ideal ) processing conditions will help greatly in the optimization of resulting organic electronic and optoelectronic devices .",

    "<S> contact resistances often contribute significantly to the overall device resistance in organic field - effect transistors ( ofets ) . understanding charge injection at the metal - organic interface is critical to optimizing ofet device performance . </S>",
    "<S> we have performed a series of experiments using bottom - contact poly(3-hexylthiophene ) ( p3ht ) ofets in the shallow channel limit to examine the injection process . when contacts are ohmic we find that contact resistivity is inversely proportional to carrier mobility , consistent with diffusion - limited injection . </S>",
    "<S> however , data from devices with other electrode materials indicate that this simple picture is inadequate to describe contacts with significant barriers . </S>",
    "<S> a generalized transmission line method allows the analysis of nonohmic contacts , and we find reasonable agreement with a model for injection that accounts for the hopping nature of conduction in the polymer . </S>",
    "<S> variation of the ( unintentional ) dopant concentration in the p3ht can significantly alter the injection process via changes in metal - organic band alignment . at very low doping levels </S>",
    "<S> , transport suggests the formation of a barrier at the au / p3ht interface , while pt / p3ht contacts remain ohmic with comparatively low resistance . </S>",
    "<S> we recently observed that self - assembled monolayers on the metal source / drain electrodes can significantly decrease contact resistance and maintain ohmic conduction under conditions that would result in nonohmic , high resistance contacts to untreated electrodes . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss measurements on extremely short channel devices , in the initial steps toward examining transport through individual polymer chains . </S>"
