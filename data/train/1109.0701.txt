    "in this paper we introduce a new empirical bayes approach concerning point processes that are clustered along curves or `` fibres , '' with additional background noise .    in nature",
    "such point patterns often arise when events occur near some latent curvilinear generating feature .",
    "for example , earthquakes arise around seismic faults which lie on the boundaries of tectonic plates and hence are naturally curvilinear .",
    "similarly , sweat pores in fingerprints lie on the ridges of the finger , which possess a curvilinear structure .",
    "figure  [ figexample ] presents these data together with two simulated examples of point patterns clustered around underlying families of curves with additional background noise .",
    "identification of curvilinear elements and elucidation of their relationship with the point data is both an interesting theoretical problem and a useful tool for gaining understanding of the origins of the data .",
    "it also provides a technique for reconstruction of missing data .",
    "@c@c@    .,title=\"fig : \" ] & .,title=\"fig : \" ] + ( a ) & ( b ) + .,title=\"fig : \" ] & .,title=\"fig : \" ] + ( c ) & ( d )    the model introduced here describes families of nonintersecting curves via a field of orientations ( a map @xmath0 assigning an undirected orientation to each point in the window ) .",
    "the curves are produced as segments of streamlines integrating the field of orientations .",
    "we say that a curve _ integrates _ the field of orientations if the curve is continuously differentiable and of unit speed , and if its tangent agrees with the field of orientations at each point .",
    "the term _ streamline _ is used to describe a curve which integrates the field of orientations and has no end points in the interior of the window @xmath1 .",
    "we choose to use a variant on an empirical bayes approach to estimate the field of orientations , since a fully bayesian approach would involve infinite - dimensional distributions and be very computationally intensive .",
    "the empirical bayes component consists of estimation of the field of orientations from the data via a tensor field as detailed in section  [ secgradfieldall ] . in the following , a tensor field",
    "is represented by assignation of a symmetric nonnegative definite matrix to each point of the planar window .",
    "tensor fields of this kind play an important role in diffusion tensor imaging [ dti , see @xcite ] .",
    "the field of orientations is constructed simply by calculating the orientations of the representative matrices principal eigenvectors ; singularities in the field of orientations correspond to points where there is equality of the two eigenvectors .",
    "we show how properties of the underlying distribution of fibres can be estimated using monte carlo techniques applied to the spatial point data .",
    "our approach has the advantage that it can be used to quantify uncertainty on a range of parameters and does so effectively for different types of curvilinear structure .",
    "the use of a field of orientations to identify fibres leads to a  strong performance on data such as that shown in figure  [ figexample](d ) , where there is noticeable alignment of points perpendicular to the fibres .",
    "point patterns with a latent curvilinear structure arise in many different areas of study .    in seismology ,",
    "epicenters of earthquakes are typically densely clustered around seismic faults .",
    "the earthquake data from the new madrid region as shown in figure [ figexample](c ) consists of one short dense cluster of points , one longer rather sparse cluster , both connected , and a relatively small number of `` noise '' points scattered over the window .",
    "the new madrid earthquake data is considered in stanford and raftery s ( @xcite ) approach to detecting curvilinear features .    in cosmology",
    ", galaxies appear to cluster along inter - connected filaments forming a three - dimensional web - like structure with large voids between the filaments .",
    "there is interest in identifying the nature of the filaments [ see , e.g. , @xcite ] .",
    "there is also evidence that these galaxies form surfaces or `` walls '' in some regions .",
    "this suggests the exciting challenge of extending our model to include two - dimensional surfaces in three - dimensional space .",
    "a further application is that of sweat pore patterns on fingerprint ridges [ see figure  [ figexample](d ) ] .",
    "sweat pores are tiny apertures along the ridges where the ducts of the sweat glands open .",
    "robust inference of the ridge structure from the pore pattern has potential for aiding reconstruction of patchy fingerprints and may also allow for more efficient storage of fingerprints in very large databases .",
    "the underlying curve structure is a dense set of locally parallel curves along which pores are located , usually very close to the center of the ridges .",
    "the noise arises mostly from artifacts in the automatic extraction of pores from the image .",
    "an issue with fingerprint pore data is that pores usually align across the ridges as well as along them .",
    "this can complicate the reconstruction of ridges , as the dominant orientation is less clear .",
    "we overcome this issue by constructing a smooth tensor field which extrapolates dominant orientation estimates over the regions of directional ambiguity .",
    "an existing method of estimating the curves in the underlying structure of a point process is stanford and raftery s ( @xcite ) use of principal curves ( a nonlinear generalization of the first principal component line ) .",
    "an em - algorithm is used to optimize the model over a variety of choices of smoothness parameter and number of components .",
    "an optimal choice of smoothness and number of components is then selected using bayes factors .",
    "this technique generally performs very well ; however , it is sensitive to the initial clustering of the data and therefore has difficulties reconstructing fibres in some regions where fibres may be expected but signal points are absent [ e.g. , the fingerprint pore data  figure  [ figexample](d ) ] .    a piecewise linear `` candy model '' ( or `` bisous model '' in three dimensions ) is used by @xcite to model filaments in galaxy data .",
    "they compare the empirical densities of galaxies within concentric cylinders and thus delineate these filaments .",
    "this approach is restricted to piecewise linear fibre models where the deviation of points from fibres follows a uniform distribution over a thin cylinder centered along the fibre .",
    "sufficient statistics of the model for data with filamentary structure are then compared to sufficient statistics on structureless data sets ; see @xcite and stoica , martnez and saar ( @xcite ) .",
    "density estimates of the point pattern can be obtained using techniques such as kernel smoothing .",
    "fibres can be directly estimated from this density ; an example of this can be seen in @xcite where steepest ascent paths along the density estimate are constructed and the density of these paths is analyzed .    a further approach discussed in @xcite is based on construction of the minimal spanning tree of the set of points . in three dimensions this gives a useful insight into the overall characteristics of the filamentary structure .",
    "the method presented in @xcite is based on a random curve model in which curvature is defined as a brownian motion .",
    "the resulting model is used to enhance contours in the output of edge operators applied to digital images and thus to data in which signal points are dense along curvilinear structures .",
    "the treatment advocated here is also based on the formulation of a general model for families of curves and the point patterns clustered around them .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , curves are modeled as segments of streamlines integrating a smooth field of orientations which encourages interpolations over areas of missing data .",
    "the prior model for the orientation field is derived via an empirical bayes step .",
    "then birth  death mcmc is used to sample from the posterior distribution of the fibres .",
    "the model formulation itself uses the initial exploratory work of @xcite [ see also @xcite ] , which focused on the fingerprint pore data and described the use of tensor fields for estimating dominant orientations in spatial point data.=-1      in particular , we are interested in modeling a  random point process @xmath2 viewed in a planar window @xmath3 ; we write the observed part of the point process as @xmath4 for some arbitrary ordering of points .",
    "the point process arises from a mixture of homogeneous background noise and an unknown number of point clusters , each clustered along a curve , henceforth called a fibre .",
    "thus a fibre is a one - dimensional object , a smooth curved segment , embedded in a higher - dimensional space ( the space containing the point process ) .",
    "random sets of fibres or `` fibre processes '' are discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "having specified an appropriate model , we must identify a suitable method of analysis of the posterior distribution of fibres given a data set of spatial point locations @xmath5 over the window @xmath6 .",
    "the paper is laid out as follows .",
    "the following section gives an overview of the model proposed in this paper .",
    "details of the underlying probability model are given in section  [ secprobmodel ] .",
    "the empirical bayes method of estimating an appropriate field of orientations is outlined in section  [ secgradfield ] .",
    "section  [ secbdmcmc ] presents a method of sampling from the posterior distribution of the fibres given the point pattern data using monte carlo methods .",
    "this is implemented for a number of examples in section  [ secexamples ] . in the final section",
    "we compare this model to other approaches , discuss some known issues of implementation and statistical analysis , and note possible directions in which this model might be extended .",
    "we use a bayesian hierarchical model to describe the relationship between the points and the fibres .",
    "is defined as the curve segment that integrates the orientation field from reference point @xmath7 in one direction to a distance @xmath8 and in the other direction to a distance @xmath9 .",
    "recall , a curve segment is said to integrate the orientation field if at any point of the segment its tangent agrees with the orientation field . ]    [ figfibreparameters ]      a natural choice is to model the spatial point process as a  mixed poisson process or `` cox process '' driven by a random fibre process . by this",
    "we mean that the points arise independently and are associated in some way with a random fibre  typically clustered around it .",
    "such a point process is called a `` fibre - process generated cox process ; '' see @xcite .    in our model we do associate points with particular fibres but we remove the poissonian character of the distribution of points along fibres , replacing this by a renewal process based on gamma distributions for interpoint distances .",
    "this allows us to model a tendency to regularity in the way in which points are distributed along a fibre but includes the poissonian case with exponentially distributed interpoint distances .",
    "in contrast to previous work , in which curves are often constructed as splines fitted to the data , we define them as integral curves of a  field of orientations .",
    "this means that at any point on a fibre , the tangent to the fibre agrees with the field of orientations at that point .",
    "note that a field of orientations is equivalent to a vector field except that each point in the field is assigned a _",
    "an instance of a random field of orientations @xmath10 is written as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 represents the space of planar directions ( with @xmath13 and @xmath14 identified ) .    the simplest way to determine a fibre",
    "@xmath15 is to choose a reference point @xmath7 on the fibre and specify the two arc lengths @xmath16 of @xmath17 ; see figure  [ figfibreparameters ] . for a fixed field of orientations",
    "this will characterize a fibre , although the parametrization by reference point and length is evidently not unique .",
    "we model the fibres in terms of these parameters ( the reference points , arc lengths and field of orientations ) .",
    "note that an alternative construction can be based on random selection of a finite number of fibres generated by decomposing the streamlines according to poisson point processes distributed along the streamlines ; however , this construction introduces intriguing measure - theoretic issues which are out of place in the present treatment .",
    "we note that taking the reference points to be uniformly distributed over the window @xmath6 will lead to a bias in the distribution of fibres in that the mean length of fibre per unit area is not constant across @xmath6 .",
    "this issue has been considered and a solution involving an adjustment to the distribution of reference points has been identified .",
    "we have not applied the bias correction to our examples , as there is sufficient data to make the bias negligible .",
    "the field of orientations is a useful intermediary in constructing fibres and , as such , is part of a useful decomposition of the construction problem . in practice , we seek to identify a suitable field of orientations by analysis of properties of the data .      finally , we include background noise in the form of an independent homogeneous poisson process superimposed onto the fibre - generated `` signal '' point process .",
    "a directed acyclic graph ( or dag ) showing the conditional dependencies for the model is shown in figure  [ figdag ] . a good introduction to directed acyclic graphs",
    "is given by @xcite .",
    "henceforth let @xmath18 denote @xmath19 random fibres . as outlined earlier and illustrated in figure  [ figfibreparameters ] , the fibre @xmath20 is determined by a reference point @xmath21 and arc lengths @xmath22 .",
    "it is also written @xmath23 [ where @xmath24 to indicate that it is a deterministic function of @xmath21 and @xmath25 once @xmath26 is given .",
    "for the list of reference points we write @xmath27 , and the arc length vectors are given by @xmath28 .",
    "we use @xmath29 as a shorthand for the total arc length of the @xmath30th fibre . note that in general the orientation field @xmath31 may possess singularities , which would constrain the choice of the lengths",
    "@xmath32 ; however , this does not arise in our examples .",
    "points from the observed pattern may be either signal or noise .",
    "signal points are typically clustered around fibres .",
    "the model we use assigns an anchor point @xmath33 on some fibre to each data point @xmath34 .",
    "the data point is then displaced from @xmath33 by an isotropic bivariate normal distribution [ i.e. , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the @xmath37 identity matrix ] .",
    "the fibre on which @xmath33 is located is determined by an auxiliary variable @xmath38 , so @xmath39 if and only if @xmath40 . the @xmath33 s on the @xmath30th fibre",
    "are spaced such that the vector of arc - length distances between adjacent points is proportional to a dirichlet distributed random variable . setting an appropriate parameter for",
    "the dirichlet distribution will encourage points to be either evenly spread , clustered along the fibre , or placed independently at random along the fibre .",
    "the probability that point @xmath34 is allocated to the @xmath30th fibre ( @xmath41 ) is proportional to the total length of fibre @xmath20 .",
    "this ensures that the mean points per unit streamline remains approximately constant .    , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "]      noise is then added as a homogeneous poisson process .",
    "this is included in the model by first allocating each point @xmath34 to noise or signal ( stored in auxiliary variable @xmath46 or @xmath13 for signal or noise , resp . ) .",
    "point @xmath34 is allocated to signal independently of the allocations of all other points .",
    "the prior probability that @xmath34 is allocated to signal is given by @xmath47 .",
    "if the point is signal , then its location is distributed as outlined in the previous subsection .",
    "otherwise , if the point is noise , it is distributed uniformly across the window @xmath6 .",
    "the total number of points @xmath48 is assumed to be poisson distributed .",
    "the mean total number of points @xmath49 is defined to be equal to some function of @xmath50 , the mean number of signal points , and @xmath51 , a parameter governing the number of noise points .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we set @xmath51 to be the prior assumption on the proportion of the total points that are noise points and define @xmath52 .",
    "the mean number of signal points @xmath50 is assumed to be proportional to the total sum of the fibre arc lengths .",
    "hence , @xmath48 is assumed to be poisson distributed with mean @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the prior estimate of the proportion of points that are signal and @xmath43 is a density parameter .",
    "the assumption that the mean number of noise points is proportional to the mean total number of points ( and the fibre length ) is particularly well suited to the fingerprint example [ see section  [ secfingerprint ] ] , where noise points arise as artifacts of the pore detection process along the fingerprint ridges .",
    "implementation of alternative relationships between the mean number of signal and noise points would be a straightforward matter .",
    "in the examples given in the next section  [ secexamples ] we use the following priors : @xmath55 p(\\bolds\\omega|k ) & = & \\prod_{j=1}^k p(\\omega_j ) \\qquad\\mbox{where } \\omega_j\\sim \\operatorname{uniform}(w ) , \\nonumber\\\\[-2pt ] p(k|\\kappa ) & \\sim & \\operatorname{poisson}(\\kappa ) , \\nonumber\\\\[-2pt ] p(\\bolds{\\epsilon}|\\alpha_{\\mathrm{signal } } , \\beta_{\\mathrm{signal } } ) & = & \\prod_{i=1}^m p(\\epsilon_i|\\alpha_{\\mathrm{signal } } , \\beta_{\\mathrm { signal } } ) \\nonumber\\\\[-2pt ] & & \\eqntext{\\mbox{where } \\epsilon_i \\sim\\operatorname{beta}(\\alpha_{\\mathrm { signal } } , \\beta_{\\mathrm{signal}}).}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath48 is the total number of points in @xmath5 .",
    "the above prior models are common , parsimonious choices that appear flexible enough for a range of applications including the examples considered in section  [ secexamples ] .",
    "however , if application - specific prior information suggests alternative prior models , then these can be accommodated in the presented framework .",
    "we are interested in the posterior distribution of fibres ( and various other parameters ) given a particular instance of the point process .",
    "this posterior is given by @xmath56\\\\[-8pt ] & & \\qquad\\quad { } \\times l(\\mathbf{f } , \\mathbf{l},\\bolds\\omega , k , \\upsilon_{\\mathrm{fo } } , \\bolds{\\epsilon},\\mathbf{z } , \\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{p }    & & \\qquad= p(\\mathbf{l}|k ) p(\\bolds\\omega|k ) p(k ) p(\\upsilon_{\\mathrm{fo } } ) p(\\bolds{\\epsilon } ) p(\\mathbf{z}|\\bolds{\\epsilon } ) \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad\\quad { } \\times p(\\mathbf{x}|\\mathbf{z } , \\mathbf{l } ) p(\\mathbf{p}|\\mathbf{f},\\mathbf{x } ) l(\\mathbf{f } , \\mathbf{l } , \\bolds\\omega , k , \\upsilon_{\\mathrm{fo } } , \\bolds{\\epsilon},\\mathbf{z } , \\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{p }    indicates a prior distribution .",
    "we omit @xmath57 , as it is deterministically calculated .",
    "section  [ secbdmcmc ] describes how to sample from this posterior distribution using markov chain monte carlo techniques .",
    "computer implementation makes it necessary to represent the field of orientations by a discrete structure .",
    "we adopt the simple approach of estimating the field of orientations at a dense regular grid of points over @xmath6 .",
    "integral curves are calculated stepwise by estimating the orientation at a point by its value at the nearest evaluated grid point and extending the curve a small distance in that direction .",
    "note that the choice of direction ( from the two available for each orientation ) is made so that the angle between adjacent linear segments is greater than  @xmath58 .",
    "consequently , fibres are stored as piecewise - linear curves and further calculations are performed on these approximations .",
    "of course , this discretization can be arbitrarily reduced ( at a computational cost ) to improve the accuracy of the approximation .",
    "we must of course identify a  method for calculating the field of orientations .",
    "it is computationally advantageous to generate a field of orientations which is likely to contain ( be integrated by ) fibres that fit the data well ( produce a high likelihood ) .",
    "the most natural way to do this is to base the calculation of the field of orientations on the data , using an empirical bayes technique . the use of empirical bayes to find the prior for the field of orientations distribution means that aspects of the prior , or parameters of the prior , are estimated from the data .",
    "an alternative approach would be to use a fully bayesian model , where we would treat the field of orientations as an independent random variable  @xmath10 .",
    "we would then need to identify its state space and a corresponding @xmath59-algebra , transition kernel and prior on this state space .",
    "these could be derived from random field theory [ see , e.g. , @xcite ] , using an appropriate covariance function to maintain smoothness in the field of orientations , however , there are a number of issues with this approach . in practice , one may expect the task of sampling a random field of orientations to be computationally expensive , particularly if the covariance function does not have a simple form ( as is likely in this model ) .",
    "calculations relating to the conditional distribution of the field of orientations given the fibres are likely to lead to unfeasible computational complexity .",
    "a  further issue is that this approach leads to a huge space of possible fibres , resulting in corresponding difficulties in ensuring this space is properly explored .",
    "use of the information given in the data will help to limit this space to a more easily explorable restricted class of suitable fields of orientations .",
    "here we use the data to make local orientation estimates and smooth these to produce a field of orientations estimator .",
    "as we are specifically interested in orientation estimates arising from the signal data , we can choose to weight the contribution of each point to the field of orientations estimator by how likely it is to be noise or signal .",
    "estimation of a field of orientations given that @xmath60 are all signal points is outlined in the following section .",
    "section [ secgradfieldeps ] shows how to extend this to take account of the information given in the vector of probabilities that points are signal @xmath61 .      the mapping and tensor method described in @xcite [ and further discussed in @xcite ]",
    "is applied to the point pattern to construct a tensor at each point . to this",
    "we apply a  gaussian kernel smoothing in the log - euclidean metric to construct a  tensor field .",
    "the tensor field is represented by an assignation to each point of a  @xmath37 nonnegative definite matrix whose principal eigenvector indicates the dominant orientation at that point ; the relative magnitude of the eigenvalues indicates the strength of the dominant orientation .",
    "the field of orientations assigns the orientation of this principal eigenvector to each respective point . if the principal eigenvector is not unique at a certain point ( which is to say that the eigenvalues are equal there ) , then that indicates a singularity in the field of orientations .",
    "three - dimensional tensor fields of this kind are commonly used in diffusion tensor imaging ( dti ) to understand brain pathologies such as multiple sclerosis , schizophrenia and strokes .",
    "dti is used to analyze images of the brain collected from magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) machines .",
    "the mri scan detects diffusion of water molecules in the brain and uses the data to infer the tissue structure that limits water flow .",
    "the three - dimensional diffusion tensor describes the orientation dependence of the diffusion . roughly speaking ,",
    "the eigenvalues indicate a measure of the proportion of water molecules flowing in the associated eigenvector direction . for more information on dti see , for example , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "let @xmath60 denote the spatial data points .",
    "a tensor is constructed at a point @xmath62 using a nonlinear transformation applied to the vectors @xmath63 for @xmath64 [ @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "specifically , @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a scaling parameter .",
    "the tensor at @xmath62 is then represented by @xmath67    the result of the above method is to produce a set of @xmath37 matrices located over a sparse set of locations . in order to create a field of orientations ,",
    "we must then interpolate to get a tensor field . thus",
    ", we use the orientation of the principal eigenvector , where defined , to construct a field of orientations .",
    "interpolation of tensors inevitably requires a notion of tensor metric .",
    "we elect to work in the log - euclidean metric [ see @xcite ] .",
    "for an extended account of tensor metrics see @xcite .",
    "log - euclidean calculations are simply euclidean calculations on the tensor logarithms which are transformed back to tensor space by taking the exponential .",
    "the tensors arising in this study can all be represented by positive definite matrices .",
    "tensor logarithms are therefore well defined as logarithms of these matrices .",
    "however , the matrix calculated in ( [ eqtensor ] ) will have a zero - eigenvalue if the points are collinear , and therefore not be positive definite .",
    "if all points are truly collinear , then our approach breaks down  and indeed the method is not intended for such noise - free data sets .",
    "the more common situation is that one vector @xmath68 dominates the tensor representation as calculated in ( [ eqtensor ] ) due to the relative distances between points .",
    "typically this occurs if two points are close while other points are far from the pair . due to rounding errors , the contribution of other points to the matrix becomes zero , and the two remaining points are collinear by definition . in order to avoid an error in the log - euclidean calculation ,",
    "if a tensor has at least one zero - eigenvalue , then it is replaced by the `` uninformative '' identity matrix , suggesting a lack of directional information .",
    "thus , we take a conservative approach that excludes any potentially misleading directional information.=1    we calculate the interpolated tensor field @xmath69 for @xmath70 as a kernel smoothing procedure , using a gaussian kernel @xmath71 with variance parameter  @xmath72 in the log - euclidean metric . hence ,",
    "when the smoothing parameter  @xmath73 is positive ,  @xmath74 , @xmath75 the field of orientations @xmath76 for @xmath77 is then defined to be equal to @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the principal eigenvector of the matrix representation of @xmath69 .    in most instances",
    "this procedure will give a good estimation of a suitable field of orientations for modeling the point process with integral fibres .",
    "the smoothing method has the drawback that it can create a bias around areas of high curvature ( rapidly varying orientation ) in the field of orientations .",
    "potential solutions have been analyzed and found to perform well .",
    "the magnitude of the bias was found to be proportional to the smoothing parameter  @xmath73 , hence , these solutions typically involve compensating for  @xmath73 : we give two examples :    we allow the smoothing parameter to vary over the window , such that lower values are used in areas of high point intensity .",
    "this ensures that less information is extrapolated to regions where there is already sufficient data , and therefore less bias occurs in those regions .",
    "we consider two instances of the field of orientations with different values of smoothing parameter @xmath80 and @xmath81 ; the unbiased estimate can be found by extrapolating back to estimate the field of orientations with @xmath82 .",
    "we do not go into further detail here because doing so would distract from the main ideas in this paper , but we do notice a minor effect of this bias in the examples in section  [ secexamples ] .",
    "details of these bias corrections can be found in @xcite .",
    "we extend this field of orientations estimation to take account of the vector of probabilities that points are signal @xmath83 by weighting the construction of the initial tensor and also weighting the contribution of each initial tensor to the kernel smoothing .",
    "specifically , the initial tensors are represented by @xmath84 for each point @xmath62 , and the tensor field becomes @xmath85    this weighting allows points that are more likely to be signal points to have a greater effect on the field of orientations estimation . as @xmath86 the effect of the point @xmath34 on the field of orientations tends to zero , whereas if for all @xmath87 we would be performing the calculation described in section  [ secgradfieldall ] .",
    "we seek to infer some characteristics of the fibre process when only the point pattern is known .",
    "typical attributes of interest include the number of fibres , where they are located / orientated , which points arose from which fibre and which points arose from background noise .",
    "direct inference from the model is hindered by the complexity of its hierarchical structure .",
    "hence , we choose to draw samples from the posterior distribution of the fibres and other variables using markov chain monte carlo methods . characteristics of interest can be estimated from these samples .      as a rough guideline , hyperparameters can be chosen as follows .",
    "the prior mean number of fibres @xmath42 and the prior mean length of fibres @xmath88 can be estimated from any prior knowledge or expectations of the fibres .",
    "the deviation of points from fibres @xmath89 can be estimated using prior knowledge of fibre widths and the approximation that 95% of points should lie within @xmath90 of the center of a fibre .",
    "the density of points per unit length of fibre @xmath43 can be similarly estimated .",
    "orientation field parameters @xmath73 and @xmath91 should be chosen to ensure the orientation field is smooth .",
    "these can be estimated by evaluating the orientation fields for different selections of @xmath73 , @xmath66 and choosing from this set .",
    "if the proportion of noise points is approximately known , then the hyperparameters @xmath92 and @xmath93 can be suitably estimated , however , we suggest choosing the parameters such that @xmath94 to ensure good mixing properties of the markov chain monte carlo sampling algorithm . otherwise the noise hyperparameters can be set equal to @xmath95 , indicating no prior knowledge .    alternatively ,",
    "if little prior information is known about the nature of the latent curvilinear structure , then it would be feasible to extend the empirical bayes step to include the estimation of further prior parameters .",
    "the starting point for our algorithm is a continuous time birth  death markov chain monte carlo ( bdmcmc ) in which fibres are created and die at random times controlled by predetermined or calculated rates .",
    "this enables exploration of a wide range of models with different numbers of fibres , and is suited to this type of clustered data .",
    "see @xcite for an introduction to spatial birth ",
    "death processes . for the sake of brevity we present in the following the key points of the algorithm .",
    "further details can be found in @xcite .    here",
    "we choose to fix the birth rate and calculate an appropriate death rate at each step to maintain detailed balance .",
    "following a birth or death we update the following auxiliary variables : @xmath96 to @xmath97 , the indicators of the components ( signal / noise ) to which the points are associated ; @xmath98 to @xmath99 , the indicators of the fibres to which the signal points are associated ; @xmath100 to @xmath101 , the vector @xmath102 where @xmath33 is the point on the fibre to which the data point @xmath34 is associated .",

    "birth events occur randomly at rate @xmath103 . upon the occurrence of a birth ,",
    "the number of fibres is updated from @xmath19 to @xmath104 , and a new fibre is introduced by sampling a reference point @xmath105 and lengths @xmath106 from the prior distributions @xmath107 , respectively .",
    "the new fibre @xmath108 is then calculated by integrating the field of orientations according to these parameters , and the set of fibres @xmath109 is updated to @xmath110 . in order to ensure that the distribution of the lengths @xmath106 is independent of the respective directions in which the field of orientations is integrated , we choose them to be independently and identically distributed .",
    "data points which are currently assigned to the noise component are reassigned to noise or signal with proposal probability dependent on the new fibre @xmath111 .",
    "finally , new values are proposed for all of @xmath112 according to a proposal density @xmath113 . for simplicity ,",
    "we choose not to sample from the full conditional distribution of @xmath100 and @xmath98 , but rather from a density proportional to the likelihood @xmath114 .    in full , the birth density of fibre @xmath108 including updates of auxiliary variables to @xmath115 is given by @xmath116      we must calculate the death rate @xmath117 for each fibre to ensure detailed balance holds .",
    "following the death of fibre @xmath20 , the variables  @xmath118 and @xmath119 are updated by omitting the @xmath30th term .",

    "all points allocated to fibre @xmath20 are now allocated to noise .",
    "we call this trivial proposal density @xmath121 .",
    "again the final step is to propose new values for all of @xmath98 and @xmath100 according to proposal density @xmath122 .",
    "hence , the death rate that satisfies detailed balance for the @xmath30th fibre is given by @xmath123      it can be desirable to add extra moves to the bdmcmc process to improve mixing .",
    "some possible moves which were all utilized in the examples in section [ secexamples ] include the following :    * moving a fibre by a small amount ( by perturbing the reference point ) , * resampling the lengths of a fibre ( while keeping the reference point fixed ) .",
    "each of these events occur at some predefined rate , whence they are proposed and either accepted or rejected according to the metropolis hastings probability .",
    "we may also wish to update other model variables , giving more flexibility and improving the algorithm s exploration of the sample space .",
    "the additional variable updates used in the examples in section [ secexamples ] include the following :    * proposing new signal - noise allocations of the data ( @xmath96 ) , * proposing new signal probabilities ( @xmath124 ) according to nondegenerate beta distributions whose parameters depend on the current signal- noise allocations @xmath96 .",
    "this move leads to an update in the prior for the field of orientations due to the empirical bayes step , hence , all fibres are resampled .",
    "details of all moves can be found in @xcite .",
    "hyperprior parameters , such as the constant of proportionality @xmath43 in the prior for the poisson - distributed number of points or @xmath125 governing the deviation of points from fibres , may also be updated .",
    "we have chosen not to update any hyperprior parameters to reduce complexity of the model .",
    "first recall that the signal probabilities @xmath124 are updated according to nonsingular beta distributions .",
    "hence , the underlying tensor field as defined in ( [ eqtensorfield ] ) will not become degenerate even when @xmath96 allocates all points to noise .",
    "consider the set @xmath126 of states in which the fibre configuration is empty and all points are allocated to noise . in the following discussion we exclude any degenerate states of equilibrium probability zero .",
    "inspection of the algorithm shows that the set @xmath126 can be reached from any nondegenerate state in finite time and so the birth ",
    "death process is @xmath127-irreducible .",
    "recurrence can be deduced by noting that the set @xmath126 is visited infinitely often ; see @xcite .",
    "we motivate a heuristic lower bound on a suitable burn - in time by considering aspects of the prior derived after inspection of the data ( e.g. , @xmath128see section [ sechyperparameters ] ) , and estimating the number of fibre births that must occur before a fibre has been created around each potential fibre cluster .",
    "we approximate the lower bound by considering the number of fibre births required for this to happen around the _ smallest _ suitable cluster of points .",
    "a lower bound on half the length of the shortest suitable cluster is derived from the @xmath129 quantile of an exponentially distributed random variable of rate @xmath130 .",
    "then the probability that a point chosen at random from @xmath6 lies in a region corresponding to an actual fibre of this length ( up to @xmath131 from the fibre ) is approximated by @xmath132 it follows that , with probability @xmath133 , a fibre will be proposed in the region corresponding to the shortest fibre within the first @xmath134 births .",
    "hence , we choose a burn - in time of @xmath135 taking 1500 as a lower bound to ensure the burn - in time remains substantial .",
    "convergence was assessed by considering variables such as the number of fibres @xmath19 or the number of noise points and using geweke s spectral density diagnostic ; see @xcite .",
    "convergence of a sequence of @xmath136 samples is rejected if the mean value of the variable in the first @xmath137 samples is not sufficiently similar to the mean value over the last @xmath138 samples .",
    "we also tested convergence by assessing whether the mean sum of the death rates is approximately equal to the birth rate @xmath103 .",
    "consider @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the sum of the death rates of fibres after the @xmath19th event ( e.g. , birth , death , etc . ) and @xmath141 is the length of algorithmic time before the next event . if the mcmc has reached stationarity , then @xmath142 where @xmath143 is an estimate of the standard deviation of @xmath139 , @xmath103 is the birth rate of fibres , and @xmath144 is the sum of the rates of any additional moves implemented ( as suggested in section [ secaddmoves ] ) .",
    "we used this result to test the convergence of @xmath145 to @xmath146 .",
    "bearing in mind the complexities of the underlying model , output analysis showed no evidence for a lack of convergence .    outputs of various variables are recorded at random times at some constant rate .",
    "the rate of this sampling ( effectively the reciprocal of the thinning of the monte carlo process ) is chosen such that there is a low probability that any of the fibres remain unchanged between samples .",
    "the inclusion of the extra moves designed to improve mixing also helps to decrease the thinning required .",
    "the thinning is chosen approximately proportional to the number of fibres ( estimated based on aspects of priors derived from inspection of the data ) .",
    "the implemented algorithm runs on a continuous time scale .",
    "events occur at a determined rate , either fixed or calculated to ensure that detailed balance holds .",
    "the units for the rate of an event are `` per unit of algorithm time . ''",
    "the bdmcmc is then allowed to run for a large number of time units and samples are taken at random times ( at some fixed rate ) . of course , the relationship of algorithm time to actual processing time depends on hardware and implementation details .",
    "hardware details are described below .    in each of the following examples ,",
    "the birth rate and the rate of other moves ( moving a fibre , adjusting lengths of a fibre , proposing a split or a join , variable updates ) were all unit rate .",

    "one of the most sensitive parameters fixed in the algorithm is @xmath238 which governs the deviation of points from the fibres .",
    "if chosen too large , the result will be too few fibres with a sizeable error in their locations .",
    "if chosen too small , fibre clusters may be split into multiple parallel smaller clusters .",
    "our experience is that the algorithm is reasonably robust to changes in other parameters .",
    "one strength of our model is that it fits the noise - signal and cluster allocations implicitly , in contrast to other cases where the clustering may need to be predetermined .",
    "the advantage is that we can produce reliability estimates for these clustering and noise allocations and explore more potential clustering configurations , and hence more fibre structures .",
    "a limitation of our model arises from the constraints on the similarity of fibres .",
    "fibres are assumed to be of the same width ( the displacement of points from the fibres is independent of the fibre ) , and have the same mean points per unit fibre length .",
    "these are not always reasonable assumptions , as is evidenced by the earthquake data set .",
    "we could extend the model to allow parameters @xmath239 and @xmath43 to take different values for each fibre in order to eliminate this issue .",
    "a further extension would be to include isotropic clusters of points which do not fit well to the `` fibre '' model .",
    "the complexity of the model , considering the infinite dimensionality of the field of orientations , raises the question of whether or not the markov chain adequately explores the sample space .",
    "our examples indicate that , while the sample space of fields of orientations is not explored particularly well , the space of fibre configurations is well explored and the field of orientations varies enough to explore a wide space of fibre configurations .",
    "however , as the density of fibres increases , so the mcmc algorithm requires longer runtime in order to overcome these issues .    note",
    "that while our model performs as well as other available techniques on the basic data sets , it demonstrates significantly better performance on the fingerprint data where a large number of dense fibre clusters account for most of the data .",
    "it is necessary to bear in mind the ramifications of edge effects in the model and subsequently the mcmc algorithm .",
    "as we are sampling from a bounded subset @xmath240 , the omission of potential points just outside @xmath6 induces a bias on distance - related measures .",
    "the field of orientations will have a bias at the edge favoring orientations parallel to the sides of a  rectangular window @xmath6 .",
    "fibres are created by sampling a random reference point from the field and integrating the field of orientations from that point .",
    "however , the reference point can not be sampled from outside @xmath6 , and fibres that extend past the boundary of @xmath6 are typically terminated on the border as no field of orientations is available past that point . also ,",
    "the model for the displacement of points from fibres does not account for edge effects .",
    "most of these algorithmic biases would be significantly decreased by creating a  border around @xmath6 and completing the analysis over the whole area . however , this would come at an additional computational cost .",
    "we have commented in passing on the phenomenon of curvature bias and its effects on the estimation of parameters , and we note this as a fruitful area for future research .",
    "further research possibilities include the fitting of two - dimensional surfaces in 3 dimensions .",
    "then new geometric issues need to be taken into account ; for example , it is not the case that a generic field of tangent planes can be developed into a fibration by surfaces .",
    "it is hoped to investigate this problem in further work ."
