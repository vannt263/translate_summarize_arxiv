    "engineering new materials to meet specific design objectives often begins by trial and error .",
    "new structures are repeatedly proposed and characterized , and the results from each iteration are used to further refine the design .",
    "this process continues until an apparent optimum is achieved that is , when the incremental modifications stop leading to improvements .",
    "however , from an implementation standpoint , trial and error is inefficient and costly , even when the process can be computationally simulated .",
    "conceptually , trial and error provides little information about the quality of the optimum .",
    "this is because the design space is often too large to permit an exhaustive search .",
    "therefore , it is common to fall back upon physical intuition ( that might not apply to the new material ) to guide the engineering process .",
    "of course , this is not to say that design - by - trial is ineffective , only that it lacks a certain degree of rigor .",
    "going beyond incremental design procedures requires an algorithmic , rather than intuitive , process . in many cases , posing the design problem as a mathematical inversion@xcite can provide an assessment of the resulting optimum .",
    "ideally , algorithmic searches might uncover alternatives in the design space that physical intuition failed to recognize .",
    "however , such an unconstrained optimum structure might prove too difficult to manufacture , in which case , the inversion optimization can be restricted to account for limitations in the fabrication capabilities .",
    "both alternatives are beneficial .",
    "the unconstrained inversion provides an indication of the absolute optimal performance of the material , while the constrained inversion produces the best structure that can actually be constructed .",
    "engineering the optical properties of photonic band gap ( pbg ) structures@xcite is a process that can benefit from inversion techniques . here , the objective is to tailor the electromagnetic modes of the crystal by adjusting its spatially dependent dielectric function .",
    "specifically , by introducing a defect into an otherwise periodic crystal , it is possible to produce localized electromagnetic fields@xcite .",
    "both the spatial and temporal properties of these _ cavity modes _ are affected by the geometry of the defect .",
    "the ability to localize light fields has made photonic crystals attractive for experiments in cavity qed@xcite and the quantum information sciences@xcite .",
    "pbg cavities offer a number of advantages that make them an attractive alternative to fabry - perot resonators .",
    "most notably , a small cavity mode volume is an important factor in achieving the strong coupling limit between trapped atoms and the cavity light field .",
    "photonic crystal cavities are capable of mode volumes on the order of the cubic wavelength of the light@xcite .",
    "modern lithographic techniques should enable the integration of pbg structures with micron - scale magnetic traps for neutral atoms@xcite .",
    "atom trapping experiments , however , pose non - trivial design challenges for photonic crystals .",
    "practical concerns in cavity qed experiments , such as atom delivery and confinement , strongly suggest using planar photonic crystals@xcite ( two - dimensional lattices with finite thickness ) rather than full 3d materials .",
    "however , two - dimensional pbg crystals only provide incomplete , _",
    "quasi-3d _ light trapping .",
    "while well confined within the lattice plane , the cavity field can decay in the out - of - plane direction@xcite by coupling to radiated modes .",
    "radiation loss should generally be the most significant decay mechanism in planar photonic cavities@xcite .",
    "therefore , maximizing the cavity quality factor , @xmath0 , requires that this radiation loss be minimized .",
    "simultaneously , cavity qed experiments require that the cavity mode function have high relative field strengths in vacuum regions ( as opposed to inside the semiconductor ) that are accessible to trapped atoms .",
    "otherwise , the atomic system will not couple strongly to the cavity field .",
    "additionally , these criteria must be met without sacrificing mode volume , _",
    "i.e. _ , by delocalizing the defect field .",
    "there has recently been considerable progress toward pbg cavities that display the necessary properties for qed .",
    "numerical design work performed in the scherer group@xcite has identified planar photonic crystals@xcite with mode volumes on the order of the cubic wavelength of the light and cavity q factors @xmath110@xmath2 , which is sufficient for strong coupling . however , with these structures , it is difficult to know if they are true optima . furthermore , if they are not optimal , it is unclear how to further improve them , _",
    "i.e. _ , whether small modifications or large changes in the crystal would be needed .",
    "this paper poses the photonic crystal design process as an inverse problem in order to provide an algorithmic optimization .",
    "that is , we represent the defect dielectric function as _ resulting from the design requirements _ , rather than proposing a defect geometry and then characterizing the crystal to observe its properties . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this paper represents the first attempt to treat photonic band gap materials in such a manner .",
    "we demonstrate that mathematical inversion leads to photonic crystals structures not previously suggested by intuitive or trial and error design techniques , and we also illustrate how fabrication - imposed constraints can be placed on the inversion optimization .    when solving inverse problems , there are two possible directions to follow .",
    "the first is to analytically treat a simplified model that captures the relevant properties of the actual problem .",
    "analytic solutions are rarely possible for structures of arbitrary ( realistic ) complexity ; however , they provide a closed mathematical description , and hopefully a better understanding , of the design process . in section [ section::analytical ]",
    "we present analytic results for a pure ( i.e. infinitely thick ) two - dimensional photonic crystal .",
    "the second class of inversion algorithms utilize numerical methods to treat more realistic descriptions of the underlying physics .",
    "however , in exchange for the more realistic model , it can be difficult to find global extrema in the design space . in section [ section::numerical ] ,",
    "we employ numerical methods to treat a planar photonic crystal membrane .",
    "the relationship between the spatially dependent dielectric function , @xmath3 , and the properties of interest , such as mode volume and q , is a composition of two individual components .",
    "first the electric and magnetic fields are related to the reciprocal dielectric function , @xmath4 , through the maxwell curl operator , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the magnetic field for the mode , @xmath7 , with frequency , @xmath8 .",
    "it is often most convenient to work with @xmath9 because the resulting maxwell equation is hermitian .",
    "this provides no difficulty because the electric field , @xmath10 can always be found from the magnetic field .",
    "the second relationship then connects the photonic crystal s electromagnetic modes to its characteristics . in some cases ,",
    "the property of interest can be directly expressed .",
    "this is true for the volume@xcite , @xmath11 where @xmath7 is the mode index and @xmath12 is defined , @xmath13 by choosing @xmath14 such that @xmath15 is max - one normalized , @xmath16 .",
    "it is also possible to directly express the magnitude of the field at the location , @xmath17 , of the trapped atom , @xmath18 where @xmath19 can always be achieved by a suitable choice of axes .    for other characteristics , such as the cavity q",

    "this is because eq .",

    "the second example incorporates numerical methods to treat a planar 2d crystal . here",
    ", there is no struggle with the notation we just write a computer program to compute the mode volume and cavity q. however , the optimization is complicated by the possibility of local minima . in both cases",

    "in this section , the photonic crystal inversion is analytically performed for a two - dimensional structure .",
    "the 2d problem is motivated by the fact that planar and 2d structures share many similarities .",
    "treating the 2d crystal allows a detailed mathematical inversion and can provide insight into how to also optimize a planar crystal .",
    "the general inversion strategy is to solve a variational problem by expanding the cavity field in the bulk crystal electromagnetic modes .",
    "it is therefore necessary to select a bulk 2d lattice with a band gap surrounding the desired cavity resonance frequency ( such as an hexagonal array of holes with a suitable lattice constant ) prior to the inversion .",
    "once the electromagnetic modes of the bulk structure are determined , it is possible to optimize the cavity q , field intensity at @xmath17 , and mode volume over the bulk mode expansion coefficients .",
    "this optimization stage does not directly involve the defect dielectric function it identifies the optimal cavity field that can be produced using the bulk crystal modes as a basis .",

    "( [ equation::maxwellcurl ] ) .",
    "methods for solving the maxwell equations for a two - dimensional photonic crystal are well established@xcite .",

    "the distinction between @xmath37 and @xmath52 is not perturbative , so there is no requirement on the relative magnitudes of the two functions .",

    "again , the mode expansion was constructed using five photonic crystal layers surrounding the defect center to provide a sufficient bulk mode basis expansion without incurring excessive computational expense .    solving the linear system of inversion equations",
    "was performed by nesting the optimization within a conjugate - gradient search for the best @xmath72 weighting parameters .",
    "the photonic crystal was again constructed by taking the contour level half way between the minimum and maximum of @xmath22 to eliminate the numerical effects of truncating the fourier expansions .",
    "the resulting photonic crystal and cavity mode is depicted in figure [ figure::asymmetricmode ] . here , the volume of the 2d mode was reduced to @xmath1@xmath104 .",
    "the center photonic crystal hole was reduced in radius to @xmath105 and remained circular . however , the nearest neighbor holes were deformed mainly in the @xmath106 direction . the minor axes , along @xmath107 , of the four holes above and below the cavity were reduced to @xmath108 .",
    "their corresponding major axes were simultaneously increased to @xmath109 , resulting in the elliptical holes seen in figure [ figure::asymmetricmode](a ) .",
    "these four neighboring holes were also radially displaced from their normal hexagonal lattice sites by @xmath110 , smaller than what was observed for the symmetric defect .",
    "there was also a deformation of holes lying along the @xmath107-axis .",
    "these were elongated in the @xmath106 direction ; however , the degree of eccentricity was not constant .",
    "the minor axes of the two horizontally neighboring holes decreased to @xmath111 , while their major axes increased to @xmath112 .",
    "the remaining horizonal holes were also vertically stretched , with major axes given by @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 for photonic crystal layers 3 , 4 and 5 , respectively .",
    "slight deformations along the @xmath107 direction were observed in the @xmath106-axis holes .",
    "however , their deformation was small , with major axes of @xmath112 along the @xmath107 direction , and minor axes of @xmath116 .",
    "no consistent deformation of hole size was observed for any other direction .",
    "the qualitative arguments suggested by vuckovic , _ _ et al.__@xcite , also apply to this structure . replacing air hole sites with higher index material",
    "suppresses the amplitude of air - band originated modes .",
    "but more importantly , the partial elongation of holes along the @xmath107 axis bears significant resemblance to the `` fractional edge delocations '' suggested by the scherer group@xcite .    as with the radially symmetric defect ,",
    "the index of refraction of the bulk holes increased , but only to @xmath117 .",
    "a similar argument based on pulling higher bands out of the light cone again applies .",
    "however , it is not as easy to provide an argument for the elongated holes surrounding the defect and along the @xmath107 and @xmath106 axes .",
    "nonetheless , it can be seen from figure [ figure::asymmetricmode](b ) that better mode localization was achieved by allowing an asymmetric cavity defect .",
    "figure [ figure::symmetricdispersion ] shows the band diagram for the optimized photonic crystal . the dispersion relationship for bulk holes with @xmath118",
    "is depicted by the solid lines , and the air hole bands are given by the broken lines .",
    "the circles represent bulk modes that contribute more than @xmath100 , @xmath119 , to the optimized cavity mode .",
    "the same argument used to explain the symmetric defect results can be made here .",
    "the crystal with @xmath118 contains more bands below the light line .",
    "a distinctive feature of the optimal asymmetric mode is that it contains fewer contributions from leaky modes ( inside the light cone ) than for the symmetric case .",
    "this can be seen by comparing figures [ figure::symmetricdispersion ] and [ figure::asymmetricdispersion ] .",
    "exactly how the larger q was achieved for the asymmetric cavity is not clear .",
    "however , it is not surprising that constraining the optimization ( for example by imposing a symmetry restriction ) reduces the ability of the inversion to satisfy the design requirements .",
    "in these two - dimensional examples , solving the design problem by inversion resulted in structures that differ from the previous , trial and error designs that have been suggested . these new photonic crystal structures , however , might prove difficult to fabricate .",
    "as such , they provide an indication of the performance of an ideal , perhaps experimentally impractical , cavity .",
    "as a final example of inverting a photonic crystal defect , we considered a hexagonal structure with finite depth to enable a direct calculation of the cavity q. additionally , we constrained the index of refraction of the crystal holes to @xmath120 . in this demonstration ,",
    "the aim was to identify an optimal planar photonic structure without requiring a more complicated fabrication .",
    "for the planar structure , it was necessary to abandon an analytical solution and perform the inversion optimization numerically . in some respects ,",
    "the numerical design problem was much simpler than the analytic case it was possible to maximize the inversion cost functional , @xmath30 , without the need for a specific mathematical analysis .",
    "instead , the spatial dependence of the dielectric function was parameterized",
    ". then the inverse problem was solved by optimizing @xmath32 $ ] over the parameter space using a genetic algorithm .",
    "however , numerical methods introduce several new challenges .",
    "for example , since the inversion cost functional involved a large number of parameters , the resulting multi - dimensional optimization was complicated by the existence of local minima .",
    "additionally , numerically integrating the maxwell equations is computationally expensive .",
    "for instance , a single mode volume and cavity q calculation can require several minutes of computer time .",
    "we considered an eight layer , two - dimensional hexagonal lattice slab , as depicted in figure [ figure::planarlattice ] .",
    "based on the previous arguments ( _ c.f .",
    "_ , section [ section::symmetricdefect ] ) , the hole radius was chosen to be @xmath88 with a bulk material index of refraction , @xmath87 . the slab thickness was taken to be , @xmath121 in order to prevent multimode behavior@xcite . parameterizing the dielectric function",
    "was accomplished by treating the positions and major and minor axes of the lattice holes as optimization variables .",
    "specifically , the cavity hole , the holes surrounding the defect , and the @xmath107-axis holes were considered . in all , there were 52 optimization variables , 4 for 13 different lattice sites .",
    "the maxwell equations were solved by employing the transfer matrix method ( tmm ) of pendry and bell@xcite .",
    "this technique provided a means for computing the stationary states of the electromagnetic field for a crystal illuminated on one edge by a plane wave ( refer to figure [ figure::planarlattice ] ) .",
    "the spatial dependence of the electromagnetic fields , as well as the crystal transmission and reflection coefficients were calculated using a first order finite difference solution to maxwell s equations .",
    "the integration mesh used to compute the wavefields extended five layers above and below the surface of the slab and absorbing boundary conditions were imposed at the top and bottom of the integration cell .",
    "the mode volume was computed by integrating the square magnitude of the electric field over the interior of the photonic crystal .",
    "the volume integration was performed using a three dimensional simpson s rule quadrature , and the result was scaled by the field maximum , according to eq .",
    "( [ equation::modevolume ] ) .",
    "the cavity q was directly computed by scanning the reflection coefficient over the frequency band gap .",
    "the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the reflection lineshape was then used to determine the cavity q.    the inversion cost functional was optimized by employing a genetic algorithm@xcite ( ga ) to maximize @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "a ga was chosen because , although not terribly efficient , genetic algorithms provide good exploration to exploitation in multi - dimensional searches .",
    "as such , they are generally successful at avoiding local minima on a complex optimization surface . however , good exploration does not come without cost .",
    "27 ga generations ( iterations of the algorithm ) were required to optimize @xmath30 , as can be seen figure [ figure::optimization ] . with a population size of 10 , a steady - state propagation routine ,",
    "a mutation rate of @xmath122 and a crossover rate of @xmath123 , the full optimization required 24.5 hours of cpu time on an intel piii 1.2 ghz desktop machine .",
    "the resulting photonic crystal and the optimized cavity mode are shown in figure [ figure::planarmode ] .",
    "as can be seen , a similar structure to the two - dimensional optimization was obtained .",
    "the cavity defect hole was reduced in radius to @xmath124 and the holes surrounding the defect were also decreased in size .",
    "the holes along the @xmath107-axis were also elongated in the @xmath125 direction , which again demonstrated remarkable similarity to the fractional edge delocations suggested by the scherer group@xcite .",
    "the mode volume of the field in figure [ figure::planarmode ] was found to be @xmath126 and the cavity q was @xmath1@xmath127 .",
    "these quantities surpass those of the best pbg cavity designs to date .",
    "we demonstrated that inversion methods provide a powerful technique for designing photonic crystals for cavity qed experiments .",
    "both an analytical solution for a two - dimensional crystal and numerical results for a planar ( finite thickness ) crystal were presented . in both cases ,",
    "the design objectives , namely high cavity q and small mode volume , were achieved .    for two - dimensional crystals , it was shown that contributions to the cavity mode from leaky bulk modes could be minimized without delocalizing the field . here , inversion produced design alternatives not previously suggested by trial and error , or intuitive design . the optimal cavity defect for both the radially symmetric and asymmetric defect optimizations called for a lattice of holes with an index of refraction greater than one .",
    "an explanation for this inversion result , _",
    "i.e. _ , bulk crystal holes composed of a material other than air , was suggested .",
    "increasing the index of refraction of the lattice holes pulls more of the band diagram out of the light cone . consequently , less of the higher frequency bulk modes are leaky .",
    "it was argued that a better localized cavity field can be constructed by incorporating these higher frequency basis functions .",
    "the inverse problem design approach was also applied to a planar crystal in order to treat a more realistic structure .",
    "however , this required that numerical methods for integrating the maxwell equations as well as optimizing the inversion cost function be adopted .",
    "it was demonstrated that a crystal with low mode volume and high q could be achieved . in order to minimize the effects of local minima in the inversion optimization ,",
    "a genetic algorithm was adopted , despite its computational expense .    for the planar photonic crystal inversion ,",
    "the dielectric constant of the bulk lattice holes was constrained to @xmath120 .",
    "this provided an example of restricting the inversion optimization because of fabrication considerations . although it may be possible to manufacture the inversion designs from section [ section::analytical ] , _ i.e. _ , bulk lattice holes with @xmath128 , it is also important to identify the best possible structure which can fabricated using currently available techniques .",
    "an aspect of the design process that was not considered in this paper was robustness .",
    "ideally , the photonic crystal would be insensitive to slight variations in its structure , as might result from small fabrication errors , temperature fluctuations , and _",
    "etc_. including robustness into design optimization problems would add additional constraints into the optimization process , however , algorithmic approaches to finding robust optima are known@xcite .",
    "in addition to investigating robustness , we plan to explore the use of optimization methods to design pbg structures with convenient geometric features , such as enlarged holes for atom trapping .",
    "it was shown that the mathematical analysis tools utilized here simultaneously optimize multiple , complimentary design requirements .",
    "achieving similar outcomes via trial and error methods is generally a formidable task .",
    "therefore , an algorithmic approach to design problems with multiple objectives , such as with photonic band gap materials , will likely only be possible via an algorithmic approach .",
    "this work was supported by the dod multidisciplinary university research initiative ( muri ) program administered by the army research office under grant daad19 - 00 - 1 - 0374 .",
    "in this appendix we describe in greater detail how to extract the defect dielectric function from the optimized expansion coefficients ( refer to section [ section::2dinversion ] ) .",
    "the general procedure involves substituting the normal mode expansion , eq .",
    "( [ equation::bulkmodebloch ] ) , and the fourier expansions , eqs .",
