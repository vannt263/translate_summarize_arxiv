    "optical microresonators hold great potential for many fields of research and technology @xcite .",
    "they are used for filters and switches in optical communications @xcite , bio-(chemical ) sensing @xcite , microlasers @xcite , as well as for cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cqed ) applications such as single - photon sources @xcite and interfaces for quantum communication @xcite .",
    "all these applications rely on the spatial and temporal confinement of light by the resonator , characterized by the resonator s mode volume @xmath2 and its quality factor @xmath1 . for a given in - coupled power ,",
    "the resulting intra - cavity intensity is then proportional to @xmath3 .",
    "this ratio defines a key figure relating the coupling strength between light and matter in the resonator to the dissipation rates of the coupled system .",
    "the highest values of @xmath3 to date have been reached with whispering - gallery mode ( wgm ) microresonators @xcite .",
    "wgm microresonators are monolithic , micron - sized , dielectric structures in which the light is guided near the surface by continuous total internal reflection .",
    "this extremely lossless mechanism of confinement enables the ultra - high quality factors ( uhqs ) to exceed @xmath4 .",
    "standard fused silica wgm microresonators , like dielectric microspheres , microdisks , and microtoroidal resonators , typically confine light in a narrow ring along the equator of the structure near the resonator surface @xcite . while such equatorial wgms have the advantage of a small mode volume",
    ", they also exhibit a large frequency spacing between consecutive modes , which scales inversely with the resonator diameter . in conjunction with the limited tuning range of monolithic wgm microresonators , tuning of ultra - high @xmath3 equatorial modes to an arbitrary frequency has not been achieved to date .",
    "this impedes their use in a large class of applications that require a resonance of the microcavity to coincide with a predetermined frequency .",
    "for this reason , the wgm `` bottle microresonator '' has recently received considerable attention @xcite because it provides a simple and customizable mode structure while maintaining a favorable @xmath3-ratio @xcite .",
    "these devices combine ultra - high quality factors of up to @xmath5 or , equivalently , up to @xmath6 in terms of finesse .",
    "moreover , they exhibit a small mode volume and nearly lossless fiber coupling , characteristic of wgm resonators , while still enabling full tunability @xcite .",
    "this makes them ideal candidates for cqed experiments .",
    "the ability to tune the resonance frequency of microresonators to other frequency - critical elements is especially important when developing sophisticated optical processing applications .",
    "for example , many cqed quantum information protocols rely on mapping the quantum state of one two - level system onto an optical field and then transferring it to another remote two - level system .",
    "such cqed quantum networks require multiple resonators to be mutually resonant and to be linked , e.g. , by optical fibers @xcite . in these situations ,",
    "it is important to be able to not only tune the resonator but to also stabilize its resonance frequency to an external reference with a high degree of precision for extended periods of operation .",
    "the need for frequency stabilization in the case of ultra - high @xmath1 wgm microresonators is made even more apparent by considering the typical situation where a temperature change of only 1  mk is enough to change the resonance frequency by one linewidth .",
    "here , we describe a scheme used to stabilize an ultra - high @xmath1 bottle microresonator to an atomic transition using the pound  drever",
    " hall technique while in a vacuum environment @xcite .",

    "this facilitates the use of the bottle microresonator as a four - port device in a so - called `` add  drop configuration '' @xcite . in communication technology ,",

    ", we demonstrated the power transfer efficiency between the bus fiber and the drop fiber to be as high as 93  % while , simultaneously , the filter bandwidth is as narrow as 49  mhz @xcite .",
    "importantly , these properties are compatible with strong coupling in a cqed experiment with neutral rubidium atoms .    due to the strong enhancement of the intracavity intensity",
    ", microresonators are often used for non - linear optics applications .",
    "for example , they are employed for third harmonic generation @xcite and the creation of frequency combs @xcite .",
    "moreover , they are very interesting in the field of `` all - optical switching '' , i.e. , the control or redirection of a flow of light using a second light field .",
    "if the resonator material exhibits a third - order susceptibility , @xmath7 , its refractive index @xmath8 depends on the intracavity intensity via the kerr effect @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the linear refractive index , @xmath11 is the nonlinear refractive index , and @xmath12 is the intensity of the light field .",
    "a variation of the intra - cavity intensity then modifies the optical path length inside the resonator and thus changes its transmission properties .",

    "several schemes for delivering atoms from the second chamber to the resonator exist : loading a 3d - mot in the resonator chamber from a 2d@xmath197-mot in the second chamber and then dropping the atoms on the resonator , or loading a 3d - mot in the second chamber , transporting the atoms into the resonator chamber using an optical conveyor belt @xcite , and then dropping the atoms , or finally , an atomic fountain might be used in order to launch atoms on a parabolic trajectory towards the resonator .",
    "dropping the atoms on the resonator , however , suffers from a fundamental limitation .",
    "assuming the atoms are dropped from a height , @xmath198 , of more than 160  @xmath13 m , the velocity acquired by the falling atoms , @xmath199 , will dominate the average thermal velocity of the atoms in the direction of the resonator , @xmath200 , where @xmath74 is the gravitational constant , @xmath201 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath202 is the atomic mass of rubidium , and @xmath203 is the atomic temperature , assumed to be 10  @xmath13k @xcite .",
    "alternatively , an atomic fountain can launch a sub - doppler cooled atomic cloud such that the heights of the turning points of the atomic trajectories on average coincide with the position of the resonator , thereby yielding the longest atom  field interaction time . furthermore , it is possible to truncate the vertical velocity distribution by temporal or spatial filtering before the atoms reach the resonator , thereby preventing the unwanted fast atoms from coating the resonator surface . for these reasons , we chose an atomic fountain as the means of delivering the atoms .",

    "the magnetic field of the mot is then switched off and the atoms are transferred into an optical molasses with a vertical velocity , @xmath205 , set by the detuning , @xmath206 , between the upward and downward pointing sets of beams . in this moving molasses , the atom temperature is further reduced to about 610  @xmath13k using polarization gradient cooling . the amount of detuning governs the velocity through the relation @xmath207 , where @xmath208 is the wavenumber of the cooling light .",
    "differential pumping between the two chambers reduces the background pressure in the resonator chamber by more than a factor of one hundred with respect to the mot chamber .",

    "a light sheet is used to probe the fountain a few centimeters below the resonator , and two zinc selenide viewports provide access for a co@xmath15 laser beam which can be focussed on the resonator in order to heat it ; this causes rb adsorbed on the surface to be removed .",

    "this allows us to perform time - of - flight measurements in order to determine the atomic velocity and temperature . for this purpose , we launch a light sheet , resonant with the atoms , through the resonator chamber a few centimeters below the resonator position and detect the atomic fluorescence with a photo - multiplier tube ( pmt ) ( hamamatsu photonics deutschland gmbh , h 6780 - 20 ) . a typical time - of - flight measurement is shown in fig .",

    "this detection light is resonant with the resonator , meaning that its transmission is low when no atom is present .",

    ", the transmission of the weak detection field through the coupling fiber will increase when an atom enters the evanescent field of the resonator and will approach unity for the case of strong coupling .",
    "experimentally , the detection light is optimized for atom detection while a second light field , called probe in the following , is prepared with a preset power and probe  atom detuning , optimized for the actual cqed experiment .",
    "both the detection and the probe light and , in addition , the frequency stabilization light have to be sequentially launched through the coupling fiber .",

    "light transmitted past the resonator ",
    "fiber coupling junction is either sent to an avalanche photodiode for frequency stabilization of the resonator or , alternatively , to two single photon counting modules ( spcms ) in a hanbury - brown and twiss configuration in order to detect the atom arrival and to record the probe transmission and photon statistics during the actual cqed experiment .",
    "light which is scattered into the anti - clockwise propagating resonator mode is out - coupled in the backward direction and recorded with the aid of two more spcms .",
    "the experimental sequence involves operating the frequency stabilization while cooling atoms in the mot and freezing the stabilization for 85  ms when the atomic cloud reaches the resonator after the fountain launch . during this brief time window , the laser light for stabilization is turned off , the atom detection beam is turned on and the spcms are gated on .",

    "the resonator is probed on resonance with an incident power of @xmath214  pw , corresponding to 0.18 intracavity photons , and the transmission of the empty resonator is maintained at critical coupling with @xmath215 . without the cloud",
    "being launched , the mean number of photon detection events per time bin is 0.07 .",
    "assuming poissonian statistics , the probability for detecting five photons in one time bin is thus given by @xmath216 . evaluating 917 experimental sequences , we find @xmath217 .",
    "the deviation with respect to the theoretical value is due to both frequency noise in the resonator frequency stabilization and mechanical noise in the coupling setup , which both cause super - poissonian fluctuations of the transmitted intensity . when the atom cloud is launched , however , the photon statistics are significantly modified , yielding a 5-photon detection probability of @xmath218 , almost two orders of magnitude higher than @xmath219 .",
    "the error bars are 95  % confidence intervals .",
    "the observed change in the counting statistics is a clear indication that atoms from the cloud interact with the resonator mode and that this interaction significantly modifies the transmission characteristics of the resonator @xcite .    in order to trigger more complex experimental sequences on the arrival of a single atom in the resonator field",
    ", the photon detection events have to be evaluated in realtime . for this purpose",
    ", the setup incorporates a field programmable gate array ( fpga ) with a clock speed of 500  mhz ( xilinx inc . , virtex-5 ) .",
    "the fpga is programmed to count photon events in a specified time window and discriminates if an atom is strongly coupled to the resonator mode based on the number of counts .",
    "when the threshold condition is fulfilled , mach - zehnder interferometric switches switch off the detection light and send the probe light towards the resonator .",
    "summarizing , bottle microresonators provide many advantageous properties for applications in non - linear optics and quantum optics experiments . in particular , in addition to the previous achievements with other types of wgm microresonators , they can be actively stabilized and offer straightforward mechanical access for two ultra - thin coupling fibers .",
    "this facilitates their operation as add  drop filters and , in conjunction with their high @xmath93 ratio , allowed us to use them for kerr - switching of single - wavelength cw light between two fiber ports at record low powers .",
    "the ease and efficiency at which these experiments could be performed bodes well for extending such non - linear applications to the quantum regime , where cqed effects with single atoms can be exploited . to this end , we have set up an experimental apparatus compatible with the requirements of cold - atom cqed using bottle microresonators .",
    "wgm microresonators pose a challenge for atom  cavity coupling due to their monolithic geometry .",
    "in contrast , the mode of a fp resonator is easily accessible because it is located in free space between mirrors . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a single atom was trapped in a fp microresonator using an intracavity dipole trap created by an auxiliary cavity mode , far detuned from the atomic resonance frequency .",
    "a raman scheme was used in order to further cool the atomic motion and thus to prevent variation in the coupling strength along the cavity axis . for this system , it was possible to measure the rabi splitting for a single atom placed in the cavity in a single sweep of the probe laser frequency over the resonance of the coupled atom  cavity system .    for wgm resonators , on the other hand , the peak value of the electric field is located inside the resonator material and coupling of an atom to the microresonator mode is only possible via the evanescent field .",
    "the spatial decay of the evanescent field amplitude and thus of the coupling strength takes place on a length scale of a fraction of the wavelength .",
    "this is much smaller than the accuracy with which a single atom can be positioned by conventional optical trapping techniques .",
    "therefore , up to now , only transits of atoms through the evanescent field were observed for wgm microresonators @xcite .",
    "a scheme was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite where an atom is confined to a circular orbit in close proximity to a microsphere by using two modes , oppositely detuned from the atomic resonance frequency .",
    "the red detuned light field creates an attractive potential , whereas the blue detuned light field compensates the vdw attraction close to the surface .",
    "another promising method for placing an atom sufficiently close to the resonator surface is offered by ultra - thin fiber - based dipole traps @xcite . in these devices ,",
    "atoms are trapped in the evanescent field surrounding the fiber waist created by two guided laser fields , again oppositely detuned from the atomic resonance .",
    "the strong exponential spatial decay of the evanescent field allows one to control the radial position of the atoms with outstanding accuracy .",
    "critically , this trap is fully compatible with the bottle microresonator concept .",
