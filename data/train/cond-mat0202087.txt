    "thermoelectric materials , which convert heat into electricity and vice versa through the thermoelectric phenomena in solids , have recently attracted a renewed interest as a promising energy - conversion technology that is friendly to the environment .",
    "the conversion efficiency of a thermoelectric material is characterized by the figure of merit @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the thermopower , the resistivity , and the thermal conductivity , respectively .",
    "recently terasaki _ et al_.@xcite found that a layered cobalt oxide naco@xmath13o@xmath14 shows a large thermopower of 100 @xmath6v / k and a low resistivity of 200 @xmath15 cm at room temperature , and they proposed that the strong correlation plays an important role in the enhancement of the thermoelectric properties . based on this proposal , other layered cobalt oxides bi - sr - co - o@xcite and ca - co - o@xcite have been studied , and they are found to be potential thermoelectric materials as well as naco@xmath13o@xmath14 . in particular , funahashi _ et al_.@xcite reported the maximum of @xmath16 is larger than 1.2 for ca - co - o , which means that the layered cobalt oxides might be the best group among all the thermoelectric materials .",
    "these layered cobalt oxides are , however , all p - type materials , and an n - type cobalt oxide has not been found yet .",
    "thermoelectric devices are made from a pair of p and n - type thermoelectric materials , and we tried to find an n - type cobalt oxide .",
    "the co ion in naco@xmath13o@xmath14 is at the center of an oxygen octahedron , and its average valence is + 3.5 with the electron configuration of @xmath17 , which corresponds to 0.5 hole in the @xmath18 bands per co site . in naco@xmath13o@xmath14 ,",
    "the octahedron is edge - shared , where the @xmath18 bands of co 3@xmath19 directly overlap each other . by contrast , electrons doped in an insulating cobalt oxide made of co@xmath20 will be in the @xmath21 bands . since the @xmath21 bands are strongly hybridized with o @xmath22 ,",
    "the conduction - band width is largest when the bonding angle of co - o - co is 180@xmath23 .",
    "thus a cobalt oxide in a corner - shared oxygen octahedron will be a good n - type conductor .",
    "accordingly we searched for a cobalt oxide in a corner - shared oxygen octahedron , and eventually found ca@xmath13(co , al)@xmath13o@xmath4@xcite , which has a brownmillerite structure with co@xmath20 . the brownmillerite structure is schematically shown in fig .",
    "big white circles represent ca and la , black circles co , shaded circles al and co. this structure is composed of an alternate stack of the coo@xmath13 square lattice and the ( co , al)o chain along the @xmath24 direction , and can be regarded as an oxide - deficient perovskite structure . in this paper",
    "we report on preparation of polycrystalline and single - crystal samples , and on measurements and analyses of their thermoelectric properties .",
    "polycrystalline samples of ca@xmath0la@xmath1coalo@xmath4 ( @xmath250 , 0.05 , 0.1 and 0.15 ) and ca@xmath26la@xmath27co@xmath2al@xmath3o@xmath4 ( @xmath280.4 , 0.5 , 0.6 , and 0.7 )  were prepared by a solid - state reaction .",
    "stoichiometric amounts of caco@xmath29 , la@xmath13o@xmath29 , co@xmath29o@xmath14 and al@xmath13o@xmath29 were mixed , and the mixture was calcined at 900@xmath23c for 12h in air .",
    "the product was finely ground , pressed into a pellet , and sintered at 960@xmath23c for 12h in air .",
    "single - crystal samples were prepared by a bi@xmath13o@xmath29/pbo flux method .",
    "bi@xmath13o@xmath29 , pbo , caco@xmath29 and co@xmath29o@xmath14 powders were mixed with a cationic composition of bi : pb : ca : co=1.3:0.7:3:2 , and was heated at 1100@xmath23c for 5h , and then slowly cooled down to 700@xmath23c at a rate of 8@xmath23c / h in air using an al@xmath13o@xmath29 crucible ( al was supplied from the crucible ) .",
    "the composition ratio of a single - crystal sample measured by energy dispersive x - ray analysis ( edx ) is ca : co : al@xmath302:1.3:0.7 .",
    "the x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) of the sample was measured using a standard diffractometer with fe k@xmath31 radiation as an x - ray source in the @xmath32 scan mode .",
    "the resistivity was measured using a four - probe method , below room temperature in a liquid he cryostat , and above room temperature in an electric furnace .",
    "the thermopower was measured using a steady - state technique , below room temperature in a liquid he cryostat , and above room temperature in an electric furnace .",
    "a temperature gradient of 1  k / cm was generated by a small resistive heater pasted on one edge of a sample , and was monitored by a differential thermocouple made of copper - constantan below room temperature , and by that of platinum - rhodium above room temperature .",
    "the thermopower of the voltage leads was carefully subtracted .",
    "the thermal conductivity was measured from 30 to 280  k using a steady - state technique in a closed refrigerator pumped down to 10@xmath33  torr .",
    "the temperature gradient was monitored using a differential thermocouple made of chromel - constantan .",

    "figure 2 shows an xrd pattern of a polycrystalline sample ca@xmath26la@xmath27co@xmath34al@xmath35o@xmath4 a small amount ( at most 7%)of impurity phase ( mainly ca@xmath29co@xmath14o@xmath36)@xcite is seen , but almost all the peaks are indexed as the brownmillerite phase .",
    "the lattice parameters were obtained to be @xmath375.28   , @xmath385.52   , and @xmath3914.66   , which is consistent with a 4-cycle x - ray diffraction of a single crystal .",
    "we will use the composition as the nominal composition in the present paper , though the real composition is different from the nominal composition . however , the difference is small within less than 10% accuracy : for example a nominal la [ al ] content of 0.05 [ 0.5 ] corresponds to 0.053 [ 0.54 ] for the real composition at most .",
    "we further note that the impurity phase of ca@xmath29co@xmath14o@xmath36 shows positive and nearly temperature - independent thermopower above 100 k @xcite , which would not seriously affect the temperature and the composition dependences of @xmath11 and @xmath10 , or the discussion in the present paper .",

    "this indicates that the substitution of la@xmath20 for ca@xmath41 supplies an electron .",
    "figure 3(b ) shows the power factor @xmath42 corresponding to the data in fig 2(a ) .",
    "the power factor takes a maximum at @xmath40=0.05 , and accordingly we fix @xmath40 to be 0.05 to see the al - content dependence .    figure 4(a ) shows @xmath11 of polycrystalline samples of ca@xmath26la@xmath27co@xmath2al@xmath3o@xmath4 , together with the in - plane ( parallel to the @xmath8 direction ) and the out - of - plane ( parallel to the @xmath24 direction ) resistivity of a single - crystal sample of ca@xmath13co@xmath34al@xmath35o@xmath1 . at 750  k ,",
    "the magnitude of resistivity decreases down to 10 - 20 m@xmath7 cm for polycrystalline samples and the in - plane direction of the single crystals .",
    "this magnitude of resistivity is the lowest , to our knowledge , in brownmillerite oxides @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence is described by an activation - type conduction , where the activation energy for resistivity ( e@xmath43 ) is approximately 0.2 ev for all the samples . as for anisotropy ,",
    "the out - of - plane resistivity is 100 times higher than that for the in - plane resistivity , implying that the layered structure is realized , as is expected from the brownmillerite phase .",
    "this means that the conduction path of a single crystal sample is two - dimensional , and the conduction path of the polycrystalline samples is mainly determined by the in - plane conduction paths .",
    "then the resistivity of the polycrystalline samples is higher than the in - plane resistivity of the single crystal sample , while the temperature dependences are similar , as is also seen in the resistivity of high - temperature superconductors . the resistivity increases with increasing al content @xmath44 , which indicates that a co ion is responsible for the electric conduction and an al ion acts as an impurity .",
    "we should note that the brownmillerite structure was not synthesized for @xmath45 , which means that an al ion is essential to stabilizing the brownmillerite structure at ambient pressure .",
    "la@xmath27co@xmath2al@xmath3o@xmath4 and single - crystal ca@xmath13co@xmath34al@xmath35o@xmath1 , width=302 ]    figure 4(b ) shows the thermopower of the prepared samples .",
    "the in - plane thermopower of the single - crystal sample is @xmath5150  @xmath6v / k , and that of polycrystalline samples is about @xmath5100  @xmath6v / k at 300 k. this means that the carrier concentration of the single - crystal sample is smaller than that of the polycrystalline samples , because no donor ion such as la is included in the single crystal .",
    "the source of the carrier is not clear at present , and the oxygen deficiency or a small inclusion of bi@xmath20 are possible candidates .",
    "it should be emphasized that the magnitude and the temperature dependence of the thermopower of polycrystalline samples are nearly independent of @xmath44 .",
    "considering the @xmath44 dependence of @xmath11 and @xmath10 , we can conclude that an al ion acts as a scattering center ( disorder ) for electric conduction , although it stabilizes the brownmillerite structure at ambient pressure @xcite .",
    "consequently carriers are likely to conduct on coo@xmath13 square lattice , not on the ( co , al)o chain .",
    "below 350 k , the temperature dependence of the thermopower is described by an activation - type conduction with the activation energy for thermopower ( @xmath46 ) of 0.01 ev for the polycrystalline samples , and 0.04 ev for the single - crystal sample .",
    "@xmath47 implies a polaron conduction , where @xmath48 and @xmath46 are described as @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( @xmath51 : the energy of bottom of conduction band , @xmath52 : fermi energy , @xmath53 : hopping energy that contributes to the change of mobility by temperature)@xcite .",
    "such a material is useful for the high - temperature thermoelectric application @xcite , because a rapid decrease in @xmath11 and a gradual decrease in @xmath10 will occur with increasing temperature .    for the present material , however , the high temperature thermopower is quite small . above 350  k",
    "it deviates from the activation type , and the sign of the thermopower of the polycrystalline samples changes from negative to positive at 500 k. a similar tendency was observed for the single - crystal sample , though a sign change was not yet seen below 550  k. as a result the thermoelectric performance rapidly decreases above 450  k. very recently ueno _",
    "et al . _ have found a similar sign change of the thermopower in the brownmillerite ca - co - al - o thin film @xcite .",
    "figure 5 shows the thermal conductivity of polycrystalline samples .",
    "the magnitude is about 20  mw / cmk , which is relatively low , possibly due to a solid solution of co and al . using @xmath12=20 mw / cmk , the figure of merit for @xmath54",
    "is estimated to be of the order of 10@xmath33 k@xmath55 at 300 k , which is three orders of magnitude smaller than that of the conventional thermoelectric materials .",
    "by examining @xmath11 , @xmath10 and @xmath12 individually , we find @xmath11 is hopelessly high , while @xmath10 and @xmath12 are comparable .",
    "this is due to the polaron conduction where the mobility is exponentially lowered with decreasing temperature .",
    "la@xmath27co@xmath2al@xmath3o@xmath4 , width=302 ]    let us discuss the sign change of the thermopower at 500 k. we should note that the electronic states ( and the crystal structure ) of ca@xmath13(co , al)@xmath13o@xmath4 resemble those of the cubic perovskite lacoo@xmath29 , which is a p - type conductor at all temperatures@xcite .",
    "thus it is very likely that holes are thermally excited also in ca@xmath13(co , al)@xmath13o@xmath4 at high temperature , which will compensate the doped electrons to decrease the magnitude of the thermopower . in general , the square lattice as seen in the brownmillerite is often symmetric to electron and hole doping ( which is exact in the tight - binding approximation ) @xcite .",
    "this means that electrons and holes are equally excited at high temperature to give zero thermopower .",
    "thus the electron - hole symmetry is unsuitable for good thermoelectrics , which might be the reason most of the perovskite related oxides are not good thermoelectric materials .",
    "we successfully prepared an n - type co oxide material for the first time , although the thermoelectric properties are not satisfactory .",
    "the figure of merit at 300 k is of the order of @xmath56 k@xmath55 , the low value of which comes from the high resistivity .",
    "the high resistivity is ascribed to the polaron conduction suggested by the fact that @xmath48 is one order of magnitude larger than @xmath46 .",
    "the sign change of the thermopower represents thermal excitation of holes at high temperatures .",
    "thus it would be less advantageous to design an n - type thermoelectric material by using co oxides with a corner - shared oxygen octahedron network .",
