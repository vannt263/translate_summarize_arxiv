    "a massive object in orbital motion suffers from orbital decay due to a negative torque caused by gravitational interaction with its own gravitationally induced wake created in the background medium .",
    "this process , commonly referred to as dynamical friction ( df ) , occurs in not only collisionless environments ( e.g. , @xcite ) but also collisional gaseous backgrounds ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the df in a gaseous medium is of great importance in understanding the formation and evolution of planets , binary stars , supermassive black holes , etc .",
    "for instance , gravitational interaction between a protoplanet and its environmental disk causes the former to migrate toward a central star , naturally explaining the presence of `` hot jupiters '' found from radial velocity surveys ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the migration also helps a planet grow faster in mass by providing an expanded gas - feeding zone at an enhanced accretion rate , which may overcome the failure of _ in situ _ core - accretion scenario in building a giant planet within a typical disk lifetime ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in the case of nuclear black holes in merging galaxies , they are expected to first experience the df to form a binary and then coalesce into a supermassive black hole by emitting gravitational waves .",
    "friction of nuclear black holes against the collisionless _",
    "stellar _ background appears to be inefficient due to scattering and depletion of stars near the black holes , which is known as the `` final - parsec problem '' ( see * ? ? ?",

    "however , recent numerical @xmath13-body / sph simulations show that the gravitational drag from the _ gaseous _ background is sufficient to form a black - hole binary in a relatively short time ( @xmath14 myrs ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "thanks to a seminal paper of @xcite , df in a gaseous medium is well understood as long as density wakes have small amplitudes .",
    "earlier theoretical work by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite considered density wakes in a steady state and found that the drag force vanishes for a subsonic perturber , while it becomes remarkably similar to the collisionless counterpart for supersonic cases . using a time - dependent linear perturbation theory , on the other hand , @xcite found that the gravitational drag force on a point - mass perturber with mass @xmath0 moving at velocity @xmath1 on a straight - line trajectory through a uniform gaseous medium with density @xmath15 and sound speed @xmath2 is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the mach number , @xmath18 is the time elapsed after the introduction of the perturber , and @xmath19 is the minimum radius introduced to avoid the singularity in the force evaluation .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : f_pt_linear ] ) shows that the gaseous df force becomes identical to the @xcite ( @xcite ) formula for the collisionless drag for @xmath20 , and is , albeit small , non - zero even for subsonic perturbers because the time dependency breaks the symmetry in the density wakes ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : f_pt_linear ] ) has been applied to various astrophysical situations including orbital decay of compact objects in accretion disks ( e.g. , @xcite ) and heating of an intracluster medium by supersonically moving galaxies in clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while the result of @xcite is valid in a strict sense only for a linear - trajectory perturber in a uniform medium , it has proven to be applicable to more general cases .",
    "for example , @xcite considered a circular - orbit perturber with orbital radius @xmath21 in a uniform gaseous medium and found that equation  ( [ eq : f_pt_linear ] ) is a reasonable approximation to the gaseous drag force on it , provided @xmath22 . @xcite",
    "numerically found that the orbital decay of a plummer sphere with a softening radius @xmath3 in a radially - stratified medium is consistent with the prediction of equation  ( [ eq : f_pt_linear ] ) , if @xmath23 .",
    "also , @xcite showed that equation  ( [ eq : f_pt_linear ] ) remains valid even for a perturber with relativistic speed if the relativistic correction factors are included .",
    "while @xcite found that the orbital decay of black hole binaries took longer than the prediction of equation  ( [ eq : f_pt_linear ] ) for a single perturber , the discrepancy between the numerical and analytical results can be reconciled , at least partly , by taking allowance for fact that an object in a binary experiences not only a negative torque due to its own wake but also a positive torque from the companion wake . for an equal - mass binary",
    ", @xcite found that the positive torque is on average about 40% of the negative torque .    since the results of @xcite are based on the assumption that density wakes remain in the linear regime , the validity of equation  ( [ eq : f_pt_linear ] ) for very massive perturbers has yet to be seen .",
    "the strength of gravitational perturbations due to a body with mass @xmath0 can be measured by the dimensionless parameter @xmath24 which roughly corresponds to the perturbed density at a distance @xmath3 from the perturber relative to the background density ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and is equal to the bondi radius @xmath25 relative to @xmath3 . for systems with @xmath26 ,",
    "the density wakes are clearly in the nonlinear regime and the linear perturbation analyses are likely to fail . identifying @xmath3 with the gravitational softening radius of a perturber ( or , equivalently , its size ) ,",
    "@xmath27 is in the ranges of @xmath28 for galaxies embedded in typical intracluster media , @xmath29 for protoplanets in protostellar disks , and @xmath30 for supermassive black holes near galaxy centers , suggesting that the wakes of massive compact objects can readily be nonlinear .",
    "indeed , @xcite reported that the orbital decay time of supermassive black hole binaries with @xmath31 depends on @xmath0 much less sensitively than the results of the linear theory , which may be caused primarily by the nonlinear effects .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate nonlinear df of a very massive perturber in a gaseous medium using numerical hydrodynamic simulations . in order to isolate the effects of the perturber mass and its velocity on the df force , we consider a perturber following a straight - line trajectory in a uniform gaseous medium , similarly to in @xcite .",
    "we model the perturber as a plummer sphere that does not possess any solid surface and merely provides gravitational potential perturbations to the background medium that would otherwise remain static and uniform ; to make contact with the results of the linear theory , we ignore the accretion of gas onto the perturber in the current work .",
    "our primary objectives are to find the changes in distributions of density wakes with @xmath27 and @xmath32 , and to quantify the resulting gravitational drag forces in comparison with the linear cases .",
    "nonlinear responses of a background to a massive perturber moving at a supersonic speed have been extensively studied in the context of the bondi - hoyle - lyttleton ( bhl ) accretion ( @xcite ; see also review of @xcite and references therein ) . unlike our models where mass accretion to a perturber is prohibited , however , the bhl accretion problem considered a perturber containing a defined surface through which gas is either accreted or reflected .",
    "it was @xcite who first solved for bhl accretion flows numerically , finding that the collisional nature of gas supports a bow shock in front of a supersonic perturber .",
    "later studies found that the bhl accretion flows exhibit unstable behaviors such as flip - flop motions of the accretion shocks and vortex shedding when the condition of axisymmetry is relaxed ( e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "while these numerical works on the bhl accretion explored temporal evolution and distribution of density wakes as well as nonlinear features in some great detail , they mainly concentrated on the gravitational focusing and resulting accretion rate of gas onto the perturber .",
    "although some authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) presented values for aerodynamic and gravitational drag forces , only a limited range of @xmath27 was covered . in this work ,",
    "we run a number of numerical simulations by varying @xmath27 and @xmath32 systematically in order to quantify the dependences of the gravitational drag force on these parameters . a brief comparison between our results with those from the bhl accretion studies",
    "will be presented .",
    "this paper is organized as follow : in  [ sec : code ] , we describe numerical methods we employ for nonlinear simulations . in  [ sec : linear ] , as a code test we revisit the cases with a spatially - extended , linear perturber with @xmath33 .",
    "we compare the resulting distributions of density and velocity wakes with those of analytical results and provide a way to handle the effect on the df force of a softening radius which is necessary for numerical simulations .",
    "evolution and quasi - steady distributions of fully nonlinear density wakes and the associated drag forces are presented in  [ sec : nonl ] . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : diss ] we summarize our findings and discuss their astrophysical implications .",
    "in this paper , we consider an unmagnetized , inviscid , non - radiating , non - self - gravitating gaseous medium and study its gravitational responses to a massive perturber moving along a straight - line trajectory using numerical simulations .",
    "the background gaseous medium is initially static and uniform with density @xmath15 and adiabatic sound speed @xmath2 .",
    "we adopt an adiabatic equation of state with an index @xmath34 throughout simulations .",
    "the simulations are carried out on a two - dimensional @xmath35 plane in cylindrical symmetry , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 denote the distances from and along the axis of symmetry , respectively .",
    "we assume that the perturber exerts only gravity to the surrounding medium and does not possess any surface , so that neither accretion nor reflection of the gas is allowed .",
    "the perturber is modeled as a plummer sphere with mass @xmath0 that is moving at a constant speed @xmath1 along the @xmath38 axis toward the positive @xmath37-direction , with the gravitational potential @xmath39 ^ 2)^{1/2 } } , \\;\\;\\;{\\rm for } \\;t\\geq0,\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the softening radius .",
    "we take @xmath3 , @xmath2 , and @xmath40 as the units of length , velocity , and time , respectively , in our simulations",
    ". then , our models are completely parametrized by @xmath27 and @xmath32 .",
    "we run a total of 58 models with @xmath27 varying from 0.01 to 600 and @xmath32 in the range of 0.5 to 4.0 .",
    "we solve the basic equations of ideal hydrodynamics using flash3 @xcite , an eulerian hydrodynamics code that implements a direct piecewise - parabolic method solver of @xcite for high - order spatial reconstruction .",
    "although the flash3 code is capable of both uniform grid and adaptive mesh refinement calculations , we adopt the uniform grid method since the accurate evaluation of the drag force requires the whole computational domain to be well resolved .",
    "as we will show below , we find that it is necessary to have at least 5 zones per @xmath3 to obtain converged results for the drag forces .",
    "our largest grid models have 3,072@xmath4112,288 zones in @xmath42 ; we make sure that our computational domain is taken to be large enough to contain the whole density wake in a given model .",
    "the simulations are typically carried out until @xmath43 when most of the wakes are well resolved and reach a quasi - steady state .",
    "time - dependent linear perturbation theories for the df drag force in a gaseous medium usually study the responses of gas to a low - mass , point - mass perturber corresponding to @xmath44 in the plummer potential ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which requires to introduce the cut - off radius @xmath19 in the linear force formula ( eq .  [ [ eq : f_pt_linear ] ] ) . in numerical simulations , on the other hand , one needs to assign a non - zero value to the softening radius , which in turn makes it unnecessary to use the cut - off radius in the force evaluation .",
    "since our goal is to compare the nonlinear drag force on a massive perturber with the linear prediction , we have to first find a proper relationship between @xmath3 and @xmath19 that makes the numerical and analytical results consistent with each other when @xmath45 .",
    "motivated by this consideration , in this section we briefly present the results of numerical simulations for a low - mass perturber with @xmath33 , and compare the resulting distributions of density and velocity wakes and the drag forces with those from the linear theories .",
    "this will also allow us to check the accuracy of our numerical experiments .    regarding the linear wakes with which numerical results",
    "will be compared , it is worth mentioning that there are several analytical methods for finding solutions for the perturbed density and velocity fields .",
    "@xcite utilized fourier transform for the space variables and laplace transform for the time variable , finding expressions both for the density and velocity wakes .",
    "instead , @xcite used a retarded green s function technique and found an expression only for the density wake that is identical to the result of @xcite .",
    "we found that while the analytical formula for the density wake agrees well with our numerical results for a low - mass perturber , the simulated velocity field differs from the expression given by @xcite . in appendix",
    "[ sec : ft ] , we revisit the time - dependent linear theory using fourier transforms both for the space and time variables . as we will show below , our expressions ( [ eq : vz ] ) and ( [ eq : vr ] ) for the perturbed velocities are in good agreement with the numerical results , confirming that equation  ( 47 ) of @xcite contains a typographical mistake .",
    "figure  [ fig : linear ] shows as color - scale images the snapshots on the @xmath37@xmath36 plane of the perturbed density @xmath46 ( _ top _ ) , the parallel velocity @xmath47 ( _ middle _ ) , and the perpendicular velocity @xmath48 ( _ bottom _ ) to the line of motion for a model with @xmath33 and @xmath49 .",
    "note that the coordinates are normalized by @xmath50 .",
    "the perturber initially introduced at @xmath51 has moved to @xmath52 at time @xmath18 .",
    "the characteristic features of a supersonic wake consisting of a sonic sphere with radius @xmath50 centered at the initial perturber location and a mach cone bounded by mach waves located at @xmath53 for @xmath54 are apparent in the top panel . also plotted as black solid contours are the results of the linear perturbation theory ( eqs .",
    "[ [ eq : alpha ] ] , [ [ eq : vz ] ] , and [ [ eq : vr ] ] ) , which are overall in good agreement with the numerical results . a careful inspection of figure  [ fig : linear ] , however , reveals that the numerical results deviate slightly from the analytical ones especially near the sonic radius and the mach waves .",
    "this is due to the fact that the perturber in our numerical models is modeled as an extended plummer sphere rather than a point mass .",
    "one can semi - analytically construct the density wake @xmath55 of an extended perturber by convolving the density wake @xmath56 due to the corresponding point mass with the extended mass distribution @xmath57 of the perturber ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for a plummer sphere we use",
    ", the convolution theorem gives @xmath58 where @xmath59 .",
    "figure  [ fig : linprof ] plots as solid lines the profiles of @xmath55 for @xmath33 and @xmath49 along the cuts at @xmath60 and @xmath61 marked as dotted lines in the top panel of figure  [ fig : linear ] , which are in excellent agreement with the simulation outcomes ( _ open circles _ ) . compared with the point - mass results ( _ dashed lines _ ) , the extended mass distribution tends to smear out the discontinuities at the boundary of the sonic sphere and the mach cone .",
    "this makes sense since a perturbed density at one location is a superposition of sonic perturbations with various strengths launched by all the mass elements comprising the extended body .    allowing for the extended mass distribution , the gravitational drag force exerted on the perturber in the negative @xmath37-direction can be obtained by directly evaluating the integral @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the wake distribution .",
    "although equation  ( [ eq : f_integ ] ) requires the @xmath64-integration to be performed over the entire plummer sphere , we empirically found that the drag force on the region with distance from the perturber larger than @xmath65 has a negligible contribution to the total .",
    "thus , in practice , we limit the integration to the region within @xmath65 that contains about 98.5% of the total perturber mass . figure  [ fig : fmlin ] plots as open squares the numerical drag forces on a low - mass perturber with @xmath33 but differing @xmath32 .",
    "the solid line corresponds to equation  ( [ eq : f_pt_linear ] ) with @xmath66 which gives the best fit to the supersonic results of our adiabatic simulations .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : rmin ] ) is our prescription for the cut - off radius when we compare the numerical drag forces with the analytic results .",
    "note that @xcite suggested @xmath67 based on their isothermal simulations .",
    "the difference between the two prescriptions may be due in part to using different equations of state and in part to low resolution ( 1 cell per @xmath3 ) in @xcite .",
    "we begin by describing the temporal evolution of our fiducial model with @xmath68 and @xmath49 ; the evolution of other supersonic models are qualitatively similar . figure  [ fig : evol ] illustrates the density and velocity structures of this model in a comoving frame with the perturber located at @xmath69 .",
    "only the region with @xmath70 and @xmath71 is shown .",
    "unlike the linear cases with @xmath72 where the density wakes have too small amplitudes to launch shock waves , the perturber with @xmath68 emits strong perturbations that quickly develop into a bow shock .",
    "the upstream gas moving toward the perturber along the symmetry axis is first accelerated by the gravity of the perturber , is shocked to subsonic speed , and then piles up near the center of the perturber .",
    "this creates a steep pressure gradient in between the perturber and the shock , tending to push the shock away from the perturber . on the other hand ,",
    "the gas flowing above ( not far away from ) the symmetry axis is deflected toward the perturber even before entering the shock and decreases its speed after the shock .",
    "this gas thus has a longer time to be exposed to the gravity of the perturber as it moves toward the symmetry axis .",
    "the gravitational potential is so deep that the material arriving at the rear side of the perturber can be pulled back toward the perturber , creating a stagnation point just as in the bhl accretion flows ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this produces a strong counterstream that moves into the upstream direction along the symmetry axis , as well as a primary vortex in the @xmath73@xmath36 plane ( fig .",
    "[ fig : evol]_a_)@xmath36 plane is a vortex ring in three dimensions , and the counterstream is a part of the vortex ring near the symmetry axis . ] .",
    "the counterstream combined with the pressure gradient in the front side pushes the shock front away from the perturber .",
    "the advance of the shock front in the upstream direction allows more time for the shocked gas to be affected by the gravity , strengthening the counterstream ( as well as the primary vortex ) and thus increasing the detached distance @xmath6 of the shock measured along the symmetry axis . at the same time ,",
    "the center of the vortex with a lower density than the surrounding buoyantly rises toward the high-@xmath36 regions .",
    "this decreases the ram pressure of the counterstream exerted on the shock front and the shock advance slows down .",
    "figure  [ fig : dtime ] plots the time evolution of @xmath6 for some selected models , while figure  [ fig : vort ] traces the trajectory of the center of the primary vortex in our standard model ( @xmath68 and @xmath49 ) on the @xmath73@xmath36 plane . for our standard model",
    ", @xmath6 keeps increasing to @xmath74 at @xmath75 . at this time",
    ", the vortex is located near at @xmath76 ( figs .",
    "[ fig : evol]b and [ fig : vort ] ) .",
    "the shock front soon overshoots a potential equilibrium position where the thermal pressure of the postshock gas supports it against the perturber gravity , and begins oscillating around the equilibrium position .",
    "the shock oscillation changes the velocity field in the postshock region , causing the vortex to move in the counterclockwise direction around its mean position @xmath77 following the background flow .",
    "kelvin s circulation theorem implies that the vortex becomes stronger as it moves toward the symmetry axis , amplifying the strength of the counterstream near the perturber .",
    "the velocity of the counterstream becomes largest when the vortex arrives closest to the perturber on its oscillation path ( fig .",
    "[ fig : evol]_d _ ) .",
    "the shock front that was moving toward the perturber is pushed by the strong counterstream , and reverses its motion .",
    "the vortex rises to high @xmath36 as the shock moves away from the perturber , weakening the counterstream , and the oscillation cycle repeats quasi - periodically .    figures  [ fig : dtime ] and [ fig : vort ] show that the amplitudes of the detached shock oscillations as well as the vortex movements grow secularly with time as the shock oscillation continues .",
    "this can be understood as follows . when the shock front is displaced from the equilibrium position away from the perturber ( e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig : evol]_c _ ) , the shocked subsonic gas can acquire an extended time to be gravitationally influenced , similarly to the early situation when the shock advances away from the perturber . with the stagnation point moving away from the perturber ,",
    "more mass and momentum are added to the counterstream , amplifying the vortex oscillation .",
    "in addition , when the strong counterstream collides directly with the shocked subsonic flow near the symmetry axis , the material at the interface is injected upward in the lateral direction and then carried in the negative @xmath73-direction by the background flow ( see , e.g. , the region at @xmath78 and @xmath79 in fig .",
    "[ fig : evol]_e _ ) .",
    "this produces small vortices near the interface that move downstream and merge with the primary vortex , again strengthening the latter .",
    "consequently , the primary vortex is able to move closer to the symmetry axis and amplify the counterstream in the next cycle , making the shock oscillation overstable .",
    "as the center of the primary vortex moves away from the symmetry axis during its last phase of the overstable oscillation ( @xmath80 ) , it becomes less gravitationally bound and can thus be more easily influenced by the background flow .",
    "for all the _ supersonic _ models we run in this paper , we find that whenever the vortex rises above a half of the accretion radius , also known as the hoyle - lyttleton radius , defined by @xmath81 , it is swept away by the background flow in the negative @xmath73-direction ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vort ] ) .",
    "when the primary vortex is located outside @xmath82 , the counterstream associated with the vortex is weak and occurs in the far rear side of the perturber , unable to pass through the center of the perturber .",
    "the counterstream is instead resisted by the flow moving downstream right across the perturber and pushed up in the lateral direction ( fig .",
    "[ fig : evol]_g _ ) .",
    "this develops another vortex with an opposite sense of rotation to the primary one , capable of pushing the latter away from the perturber ( fig .",
    "[ fig : evol]_h _ ) . with",
    "the primary vortex carried away downstream , the flow near the perturber reaches a quasi - steady state in which shocked subsonic gas moves almost parallel to the symmetry axis . since the associated kinetic energy is much smaller than the thermal and gravitational energies of the gas , the density distribution around the perturber becomes nearly hydrostatic , as will be shown below .",
    "figure  [ fig : subs ] displays density and velocity structures of a nonlinear subsonic model with @xmath68 and @xmath83 in a comoving frame with the perturber . snapshots at @xmath84 , 150 , and 600 are shown .",
    "sound waves launched from the perturber at @xmath85 propagate radially outward into the surrounding medium , forming a spherical causal region within which the medium is affected by the sonic perturbations . since the perturber is spatially extended , however , the boundary of the casual region is not as sharp as in the case of a point mass , although the most dominant perturbations still come from the perturber center . unlike supersonic cases ,",
    "this model always involves subsonic flows and never produces a shock .",
    "nevertheless , the overall flow pattern and late - time density structure near the perturber of this model is very similar to those in the postshock subsonic regions of supersonic models .",
    "first of all , the strong gravitational pull forms a counterstream and an associated vortex ring near the symmetry axis ( fig .  [ fig : subs]_a _ ) .",
    "the counterstream moving in the upstream direction interacts with the incident flow ( fig .",
    "[ fig : subs]_b _ ) .",
    "the gas at the interface is pushed up toward the high-@xmath36 regions and then carried downstream , creating small vortices with low density ( fig .",
    "[ fig : subs]_c _ ) .",
    "the primary vortex slowly rises in the @xmath36-direction due to buoyancy , and merge with the small vortices . since this model does not contain a shock that would confine the region of influence and since the causal region keeps expanding at a sonic speed , the flows in the high-@xmath36 regions are almost parallel to the symmetry axis . as a result ,",
    "the primary vortex keeps rising as there is no momentum input in the background flow capable of pushing it back toward the symmetry axis . at the end of the run ( @xmath43 ) ,",
    "the primary vortex in this model arrives at @xmath86 , corresponding to @xmath87 .",
    "it is uncertain whether the primary vortex will be carried downstream when it goes beyond @xmath88 in a manner similar to supersonic cases . at any event ,",
    "the density distribution close to the perturber is well described by the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium at late time ( see  [ sec : wake ] below ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : compadens ] illustrates changes in the quasi - steady density wakes with varying @xmath27 on the @xmath73@xmath36 plane for supersonic models with fixed @xmath49 at @xmath43 .",
    "the left panels show large - scale views of the wakes at @xmath89 and @xmath90 , while the region near the perturber with @xmath91 and @xmath92 is enlarged in the right panels . in each panel ,",
    "the perturber is located at @xmath93 , and the black line connecting the points @xmath94 and @xmath95 marks the boundary of the mach cone characteristics of the linear density wake for @xmath49 . when @xmath72 , the sonic perturbations are too weak to produce a shock , and the high - density ridge of the wake follows the mach cone fairly well , although it is broadened due to the extended mass distribution of the perturber .",
    "as @xmath27 increases to unity , sonic perturbations even outside the mach cone attain substantial amplitudes enough to induce a bow shock that is attached to the center of the perturber ( within the resolution limit ) .",
    "since the density wake is effectively shifted toward the perturber compared with the linear case and still located preferentially at the rear side of the perturber , the resulting drag force will be larger than the linear counterpart ( see  [ sec : force ] ) .",
    "as @xmath27 increases further , the shocked material gathered around the perturber begins to build up a strong pressure barrier which the incident flow can not easily penetrate .",
    "this naturally makes the shock detached .",
    "figure  [ fig : compadens]_b , c _ shows that the postshock density distribution around the perturber with @xmath96 or 20 is almost spherically symmetric , indicating that the kinetic energy of the gas there is much smaller than the thermal and gravitational potential energies . to check",
    "if this is indeed the case , we plot in figure  [ fig : hse ] the density profiles along the symmetry axis and the @xmath36-axis from the center of a massive perturber with @xmath68 ; both supersonic and subsonic models with @xmath49 and @xmath97 at @xmath43 are presented .",

    "the sharp drop offs of the density in the supersonic model near @xmath109 and @xmath110 along the @xmath104- and @xmath36-directions , respectively , are of course due to the bow shock . in the subsonic model",
    ", the presence of the primary vortex makes the local density decreased at @xmath111 .",
    "note that the quantity @xmath112 measures the specific entropy and thus is conserved in an adiabatic flow without involving a shock , as is the case in the subsonic model .",
    "for the supersonic model , however , @xmath112 is increased from unity to 1.34 because of a shock jump .",
    "this corresponds to the shock mach number of @xmath113 , which is larger than @xmath49 because the flow is accelerated by the perturber even before experiencing the shock . in the regions with @xmath114 ,",
    "the density is overall larger along the @xmath105- than @xmath104-directions , providing non - vanishing drag forces .",
    "nonetheless , the presence of hydrostatic cores in the density wakes of massive supersonic perturbers makes the drag forces smaller than the linear results .    while the density wake _ near",

    "even with low amplitudes of local perturbations , however , the region with @xmath120 along the symmetry axis behind the perturber has the nonlinear density wake that deviates considerably from the linear case .",
    "this is because the gas flowing in this region was already affected by strong gravitational potential in the upstream region , and has a diverging velocity field that reduces the perturbed density .",

    ", the shock has a larger standoff distance without noticeable oscillations and the df force is correspondingly smaller than in models with higher resolution . compared with the @xmath157 model , the model with @xmath158 presents the shock oscillations with higher amplitudes and arrives at quasi - steady equilibrium earlier .",

    "df of bodies orbiting in a gaseous medium is of great importance in various astronomical systems ranging from protoplanetary disks to galaxy clusters . in previous analytic studies of df",
    ", it has been assumed that the mass of a moving object is small enough for the induced density wake to have low amplitudes and be thus in the linear regime .",
    "however , there are many astronomical situations such as in a merger of black holes near a galaxy center and migration of protoplanets , where a perturber is so massive that the induced wakes are well in the nonlinear regime . in this paper",
    ", we use numerical hydrodynamic simulations to explore nonlinear gravitational responses of the gas to , and the resulting drag force on , a perturber with mass @xmath0 moving straight at velocity @xmath1 in an initially static , uniform background with density @xmath15 and adiabatic sound speed @xmath2 .",
    "the perturber is represented by a plummer sphere with softening radius @xmath3 . unlike in the bhl problems , the perturber in our models",
    "does not possess a defined surface through which gas is accreted or reflected .",
    "assuming an axial symmetry , we solve the basic equations on the ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) plane , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 denote the direction perpendicular and parallel to the motion of the perturber , respectively .",
    "our numerical models are completely characterized by two dimensionless parameters : @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "to study df in various situations , we run as many as 58 models that differ in @xmath27 and @xmath32 .",
    "our standard models have 5 zones per @xmath3 , but we also run models with different resolutions to ensure that the density and velocity wakes are fully resolved .    for supersonic models ( @xmath159 ) , we find that a massive perturber with @xmath26 produces a bow shock ahead of it through which the incident supersonic flow becomes subsonic . in the beginning ,",
    "the postshock flow in the nonlinear cases develops transient features such as a primary vortex ring and an associated counterstream near the symmetry axis , which causes the shock to oscillate around its equilibrium position .",
    "the shock oscillation added by the counterstream is overstable , amplifying the amplitudes of its oscillation and the vortex movement in the ( @xmath36 , @xmath37)-plane ( see  [ sec : general ] ) .",
    "the vortex ring is eventually shed downstream from the perturber , leaving the nearly - stationary bow shock and a quasi - hydrostatic envelope that surrounds the perturber . on the other hand , subsonic models with @xmath26 without involving a shock retain a primary vortex and many other small - scale structures until the end of runs .",
    "nevertheless , strong gravity makes the density distribution near the perturber still very close to that under hydrostatic equilibrium .    by comparing the numerical results from various supersonic models with differing @xmath27 and @xmath32",
    ", we find that the simulation outcomes such as the detached shock distance and the gravitational df force are very well quantified by a single parameter @xmath128 defined in equation  ( [ eq : amod ] ) .",
    "when @xmath146 , the system is in the linear regime where a mach cone is bounded by low - amplitude mach waves , and the drag force is just the same as the analytic linear value @xmath12 of @xcite .",
    "when @xmath123 is moderate at @xmath126 , the mach waves turn into a bow shock that is weakly detached , with the standoff distance @xmath160 from the perturber . in this case ,",
    "the density wake is slightly shifted toward the perturber compared with the linear counterpart , causing the drag force to be larger than @xmath12 by a factor of less than 1.2 . in the highly nonlinear regime with @xmath11 , however , the detached shock distance behaves as @xmath161 , and the nonlinear drag force @xmath7 is given by @xmath162 .",
    "the reduction of the drag force compared with the linear value is because the density wake close to the perturber is in near - hydrostatic equilibrium and thus contributes a negligible amount to the net df force .",
    "since front - back symmetry notable for nonlinear wakes exists also in the linear wakes with @xmath163 , the nonlinear drag force on a massive subsonic perturber is similar to the linear prediction .    as mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : intro ] , our model simulations differ from those of the bhl accretion flows in terms of the boundary conditions . in our models , a perturber simply provides a gravitational potential for the background gas and does not hold any surface , while models for the bhl accretion considered a defined surface through which the gas is accreted or reflected .",
    "the different boundary conditions might lead to different evolution and structure of wakes .",
    "for instance , the bhl accretion flows around a perturber present nonlinear features including a detached bow shock , vortex oscillations , and counterstreams in the forward / backward directions , just as in our models , if the perturber is not perfectly absorbing @xcite . when the perturber has a totally absorbing surface , on the other hand , the wakes are relatively quiescent , flowing nearly spherically into the perturber that absorbs the angular momentum carried by the accreting gas @xcite . in the case of an extremely small perturber compared with the accretion radius ,",
    "even an absorbing body produces violent features since it is not able to accept the whole accreting gas @xcite .    despite these differences ,",
    "the detached distances of bow shocks and the resulting df forces appear to be not so sensitive to the boundary conditions adopted .",

    "the bhl results under the reflecting boundary conditions are larger than our results by a factor of only @xmath164 , while those under the absorbing boundary conditions are smaller by a factor of @xmath165 .",
    "since the work on the bhl accretion mostly focused on mass accretion rates , only a few of them evaluated the gravitational drag forces . in figure",
    "[ fig : fa ] , we plot using star symbols the drag forces from the adiabatic runs with @xmath34 in @xcite , which are the only data we acquired from the literature that allow a reliable comparison with our results .",
    "note that the drag force is larger on a purely - absorbing perturber for which the detached shock distance is smaller .",
    "the df forces from @xcite are roughly consistent with , and follow a similar trend to , our results .",
    "this is probably because even though density wakes are nowhere close to being hydrostatic in bhl accretion flows , they somehow maintain front - back symmetry that makes the net df force smaller .",
    "while we have considered in this paper only an adiabatic gas with index @xmath34 , we note that the df force may depends sensitively on @xmath166 .",
    "simulations of the bhl accretion flows reported that as @xmath166 decreases , the detached shock distance decreases and the density wake becomes shaped increasingly into a cone - like structure similar to the linear wake @xcite .",
    "this is presumably because bow shocks in lower-@xmath166 models should be stronger in order to compensate for the diminished pressure in supporting the postshock gas against the perturber s gravity .",

    ", we infer that the orbital decay time scales with the black hole mass as @xmath167 in their simulations , which is somewhat shallower than the linear expectation of @xmath168 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "our results predict @xmath169 if the perturber is sufficiently massive , suggesting that the delayed orbital decay of supermassive black holes in @xcite is partly due to the nonlinear effect .",

    "while we consider quite an ideal situation in which a perturber is moving straight in a static , uniform medium , the gas in @xcite is distributed in a rotating , radially - stratified , self - gravitating disk and the black holes follow curvilinear , possibly eccentric , orbits .",

    "<S> using high - resolution , two - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations , we investigate nonlinear gravitational responses of gas to , and the resulting drag force on , a very massive perturber @xmath0 moving at velocity @xmath1 through a uniform gaseous medium of adiabatic sound speed @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we model the perturber as a plummer potential with softening radius @xmath3 , and run various models with differing @xmath4 and @xmath5 by imposing cylindrical symmetry with respect to the line of perturber motion . for supersonic cases , </S>",
    "<S> a massive perturber quickly develops nonlinear flows that produce a detached bow shock and a vortex ring , which is unlike in the linear cases where mach cones are bounded by low - amplitude mach waves . </S>",
    "<S> the flows behind the shock are initially non - steady , displaying quasi - periodic , overstable oscillations of the vortex ring and the shock . the vortex ring is eventually shed downstream and the flows evolve toward a quasi - steady state where the density wake near the perturber is in near hydrostatic equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the detached shock distance @xmath6 and the nonlinear drag force @xmath7 depend solely on @xmath8 such that @xmath9 and @xmath10 for @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the linear drag force of ostriker ( 1999 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the reduction of @xmath7 compared with @xmath12 is caused by front - back symmetry in the nonlinear density wakes . in subsonic cases , the flows without involving a shock do not readily reach a steady state . nevertheless , the subsonic density wake near a perturber is close to being hydrostatic , resulting in the drag force similar to the linear case . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that dynamical friction of a very massive object as in a merger of black holes near a galaxy center will take considerably longer than the linear prediction . </S>"
