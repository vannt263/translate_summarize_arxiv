    ", no all - sky survey using imaging instruments has been performed to date .",
    "the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) sky survey in the @xmath14 energy band revealed about 100 agns , showing an even higher fraction of absorbed ( @xmath15 ) sources of about 60% @xcite . the _ international gamma - ray astrophysics laboratory _ ( _ integral _ ; winkler et al . 2003 ) offers an unprecedented @xmath16 collecting area and state - of - the - art detector electronics and background rejection capabilities .",
    "notably , the imager ibis with an operating range from @xmath17 and a fully - coded field of view of @xmath18 enables us now to study a large portion of the sky .",
    "a first catalog of agns showed a similar fraction of absorbed objects as the _ rxte _ survey @xcite . the burst alert telescope ( bat ) of the _ swift _ mission @xcite operates in the 15  200 kev band and uses a detector similar to ibis / isgri , but provides a field of view about twice the size .",
    "the bat data of the first three months of the mission provided a high galactic latitute survey , including 44 agns @xcite . within this sample a weak anti - correlation of luminosity versus intrinsic absorption was found as previously found in the @xmath19 band @xcite , revealing that most of the objects with luminosities @xmath20 show no intrinsic absorption .",
    "markwardt et al .",
    "( 2005 ) also pointed out that this luminosity corresponds to the break in the luminosity function .",
    "related to the compilation of agn surveys in the hard x - rays is the question of what sources form the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) .",
    "while the cxb below 20 kev has been the focus of many studies , the most reliable measurement in the 10 - 500 kev has been provided by the _ high energy astronomical observatory _ ( _ heao 1 _ ) , launched in 1977 ( marshall et al .",

    "1980 , gruber et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the isotropic nature of the x - ray background points to an extragalactic origin , and as the brightest persistent sources are agns , it was suggested early on that those objects are the main source of the cxb ( e.g. setti & woltjer 1989 ) . in the soft x",

    "1998 ) . at higher energies ( @xmath24 ) , _ asca _ and _ chandra _ surveys measured the hard x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) of agns and its cosmological evolution .",
    "these studies show that in this energy range the cxb can be explained by agns , but with a higher fraction of absorbed ( @xmath15 ) objects than in the soft x - rays ( e.g. ueda et al .",
    "a study based on the _ rxte _ survey by sazonov & revnivtsev ( 2004 ) derived the local hard x - ray luminosity function of agns in the 320 kev band .",
    "they showed that the summed emissivity of agns in this energy range is smaller than the total x - ray volume emissivity in the local universe , and suggested that a comparable x - ray flux may be produced together by lower luminosity agns , non - active galaxies and clusters of galaxies . using the _",

    "the analysis was performed using the offline science analysis ( osa ) software version 5.0 distributed by the isdc ( courvoisier et al .",

    "fluxes are determined by integrating the best - fit spectral model over the 2040 kev bandpass .",
    "the uncertainty in the absolute flux calibration is about 5% .",
    "the luminosities listed are the luminosities in this energy band , based on the measured ( absorbed ) flux .",
    "the absorption listed is the intrinsic absorption in units of @xmath37 as measured in soft x - rays below 10 kev by various missions as referenced .",

    "those sources are marked in tab .",
    "[ catalog ] and are not used in our analysis .",
    "in order to compute the agn number - flux relation it is necessary to have a complete and unbiased sample . towards this end , one must understand the characteristics of the survey , such as the sky coverage and completeness for each subset of the total sample . because of the in - homogeneous nature of the survey exposure map",
    ", we applied a significance limit rather than a flux limit to define a complete sample .",
    "the task is to find a significance limit which ensures that all objects above a given flux limit have been included . to test for completeness",
    ", the @xmath38-statistic has been applied , where @xmath39 stands for the volume that is enclosed by the object , and @xmath40 is the accessible volume , in which the object could have been found ( avni & bahcall 1980 ) .    in the case of no evolution @xmath41 is expected .",
    "this evolutionary test is applicable only to samples complete to a well - defined significance limit .",
    "it can therefore also be used to test the completeness of a sample .",
    "we performed a series of @xmath38-tests to the _ integral _ agn sample , assuming completeness limits in the range of @xmath42 up to @xmath43 isgri 20  40 kev significance . for a significance limit below the true completeness limit of the sample one",
    "expects the @xmath38-tests to derive a value @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the true test result for a complete sample . above the completeness",
    "limit the @xmath46 values should be distributed around @xmath45 within the statistical uncertainties .",
    "the results of the tests are shown in figure  [ fig : vvmaxtest ] .",
    "it appears that the sample becomes complete at a significance cutoff of approximately @xmath47 , which includes 38 agns .",
    "the average value is @xmath48 .",
    "this is consistent with the expected value of 0.5 at the @xmath49 level , suggesting no evolution and a uniform distribution in the local universe .",
    "it is unlikely that cosmological effects have an influence on the result , as the average redshift in the sample is @xmath50 , with a maximum redshift of @xmath51 .",
    "a positive cosmological evolution would result in a slightly higher value than @xmath52 .",
    "we would like to remind that we use the @xmath46 test is not to determine any cosmological effects , but use it to see at what significance level it returns a stable value .",
    "a correct representation of the number flux distribution ( i.e. @xmath53 versus @xmath54 , see beckmann et al",
    ". 2006b ) for the sample presented here must account for different exposure times comprising our survey , and the resulting sensitivity variations .",
    "we determine here the number density and thus the number of agns above a given flux has to be counted and divided by the sky area in which they are detectable throughout the survey .",
    "we therefore first determined the exposure time in @xmath55 sky elements of @xmath56 size within our survey . in each sky bin ,",
    "the exposure is the sum of each individual exposure multiplied by the fraction of the coded field of view in this particular direction .",
    "the dead time and the good time intervals ( gti ) are not taken into account but the dead time is fairly constant ( around 20% ) and gti gaps are very rare in ibis / isgri data .",
    "figure  [ fig : exposuremap ] shows the exposure map in galactic coordinates for this survey .",
    "we excluded those fields with an exposure time less than 2 ks , resulting in @xmath57 sky elements with a total coverage of @xmath58 .",
    "the flux limit for a given significance limit should be a function of the square root of the exposure time , if no systematic effects apply , but this assumption can not be made here .",
    "the nature of coded - mask imaging leads to accumulated systematic effects at longer exposure times . in order to achieve a correlation between the exposure time and the flux limit",
    ", we therefore used an empirical approach . for each object",
    "we computed what we will call its @xmath33 equivalent flux @xmath59 , based on its actual flux @xmath60 and its significance @xmath61 : @xmath62 .",
    "we found a correlation between these @xmath59 values and exposure times , which has a scatter of @xmath63 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : polyfit ] ) .",
    "the correlation was then fitted by a smooth polynomial of third degree .",
    "this function was then used to estimate the limiting flux of each individual survey field .",
    "it must be noted that the individual limits are not important , but only the distribution of those flux limits .",
    "the total area in the survey for a given flux limit is shown in figure  [ fig : fluxlimits ] .",
    "based on the flux limits for all survey fields , we are now able to construct the number flux distribution for the _ integral _ agns , determining for each source flux the total area in which the source is detectable with a @xmath47 detection significance in the @xmath6 energy band . the resulting correlation is shown in figure  [ fig : lognlogs5 ] .      we applied a maximum - likelihood ( ml ) algorithm to our empirical number - flux distribution to obtain a power - law approximation of the form @xmath64 .",
    "we note that we are fitting the `` integrated '' @xmath65 function , as distinct from the `` differential '' number - flux function .",
    "the latter entails binning the data , and thus some loss of information is incurred .",
    "the advantage of fitting the differential distribution is that a simple least squares procedure may be employed .",
    "however , given the modest size of our sample , the expected loss of accuracy was considered unacceptable .",
    "our approach was based on the formalism derived by murdoch , crawford & jauncey ( 1973 ) , also following the implementation of piccinotti et al .",
    "the latter involved modification of the basic ml incorporated to facilitate handling of individual source flux - measurement errors .",
    "the ml method also involves the application of a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test as part of the procedure to optimize the fit , as detailed in murdoch , crawford & jauncey ( 1973 ) ( we note that the ks test as applied in this context is not a measure of the overall goodness of fit ) .",
    "once the slope is determined , a chi - square minimization is used to determine the amplitude k.    for this analysis , we used the complete sub - sample of 38 sources for which the statistical significance of our flux determinations was at a level of @xmath33 or greater .",
    "the dimmest source among this sub - sample was @xmath66 , and the brightest was @xmath67 .",
    "we derived a ml probability distribution , which can be approximated by a gaussian , with our best fit parameters of @xmath4 .",
    "a normalization of @xmath68 was then obtained by performing a least - squares fit , with the slope fixed to the ml value .",
    "this calculation did not take into account possible inaccuracies associated with scatter in fig .",
    "[ fig : polyfit ] , and thus in the true detection limit . the true exposure time is also affected by small variations in dead - time effects known to occur in the isgri detector .",
    "a conservative upper limit on the exposure time uncertainty is @xmath69 .",
    "this leads to uncertainty in the final log n - log s primarily manifest in the normalization and it should not affect the slope significantly . furthermore , the uncertainty in the detection limit will affect mainly the low flux end of the log(n ) ",
    "log(s ) distribution .",
    "the high flux end is less sensitive to scatter , since it is based on a larger sky area ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fluxlimits ] ) . to make a more quantitative assessment",
    ", we have recomputed the ml log(n ) ",
    "log(s ) calculation for scenarios in which the exposure time  flux limit curve shifted in amplitude and pivoted about the 700 ks point where we have the highest density of measurements .",
    "for those scenarios , we found that the inferred log(n ) ",
    "log(s ) slope varied by less than about 5% , which is contained within the range of our quoted 1-sigma uncertainty .",
    "the amplitude varied by as much as 7% in the extreme case , but for the pivoted cases , by only a few percent .",
    "we thus conclude that the maximum uncertainty resulting from possible systematics in our effective area correction is bounded by about 5% in slope and 7% in amplitude .",
    "the complete sample of _ integral _ agns with a detection significance @xmath36 also allows us to derive the density of these objects in the local universe as a function of their luminosity . in order to derive the density of objects above a given luminosity",
    ", one has to determine for each source in a complete sample the space volume in which this source could have been found considering both the flux limit of each survey field and the flux of the object .",
    "we have again used the correlation between exposure time and flux limit as discussed in the previous section in order to assign a @xmath47 flux limit to each survey field .",
    "then the maximum redshift @xmath70 at which an object with luminosity @xmath71 would have been detectable in each sky element was used to compute the total accessible volume @xmath72\\ ] ] with @xmath73 being the number of sky elements in which the object would have been detectable and @xmath74 the solid angle covered by sky element @xmath75 , and @xmath76 the enclosed volume based on the maximum redshift at which the object could have been detected in this sky element .",
    "figure  [ fig : lumicum ] shows the cumulative luminosity function for 38 _ integral _ detected ( @xmath35 ) agns in the 20  40 kev energy band . here",
    "the density @xmath77 describes the number of objects per @xmath78 above a given luminosity @xmath71 : @xmath79 with @xmath80 being the number of objects with luminosities @xmath81 .",
    "blazars have been excluded because their emission is not isotropic .",
    "the redshifts in the sample range from @xmath82 to @xmath83 with an average redshift of @xmath50 .",
    "thus the luminosity function is truly a local one .",
    "figure  [ fig : lumidiff ] shows the luminosity function in differential form . in this presentation",
    "the data points are independent of each other . in case one of the luminosity bins",
    "would suffer from incompleteness compared to the other bins , this would result in a break or dip in the differential luminosity function .",
    "the errors are based on the number of objects contributing to each value .",
    "the differential xlf also shows , like the cumulative one , a turnover around @xmath84 .",
    "because our study is based solely on low redshift objects , we are not able to constrain models involving evolution with redshift .",
    "nevertheless we can compare the xlf presented here with model predictions from previous investigations .",

    "the best fit values we obtained are @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 with @xmath90 in units of @xmath91 .",
    "the @xmath92 errors have been determined by applying a monte carlo simulation which simultaneously takes into account the flux errors on the individual sources , the error induced by deriving an average luminosity per bin , and the statistical error of the density based on the number of objects contributing to the density value .",
    "each simulated data set included 9 luminosity values with a density value for each of them .",
    "these values where then fit by the smoothly connected two power - law function as described above .",
    "the scatter in the resulting parameters gave the error estimates as shown above .",
    "the parameter values describing the differential luminosity function are consistent with values derived from the @xmath24 xlf of agns as shown by e.g. ueda et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , franca et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , and shinozaki et al .",
    "for example the work by ueda et al . ( 2003 ) reveals for a pure density evolution model the same values ( within the error bars ) for @xmath93 and @xmath94 , but a higher @xmath95 .",
    "the higher value can be easily explained by the different energy bands applied .",
    "a single power law with photon index of @xmath96 in the range @xmath97 would lead to @xmath98 , assuming no intrinsic absorption .",
    "this has , of course , no implications for the xlf at higher redshifts .",
    "the values are also consistent with the luminosity function for agns in the @xmath14 band as derived by sazonov & revnivtsev ( 2004 ) from the _ rxte _ all - sky survey .",
    "information about intrinsic absorption is available for 32 of the 38 objects ( 89% ) from soft x - ray observations .",
    "this enables us to derive the luminosity function for absorbed ( @xmath99 ) and unabsorbed sources , as shown in figure  [ fig : lumiabsorbed ] .",
    "the absorbed sources have a higher density than the unabsorbed sources at low luminosities , while this trend is inverted at high luminosities .",
    "the luminosity where both agn types have similar densities is about @xmath100 .",
    "this tendency is also evident when comparing the fraction of absorbed agns with the luminosity in the three luminosity bins depicted in figure  [ fig : fracabs ] .",
    "the luminosity bins have been chosen so that an equal number of objects are contained in each bin .",
    "the position of the data point along the luminosity axis indicates the average luminosity in this bin , while the error bars in luminosity indicate the range of luminosities covered .",
    "a comparable trend has been seen also below 10 kev . in a recent study of _",
    "_ data of 49 agns , shinozaki et al .",
    "( 2006 ) showed that the xlf for absorbed agns drops more rapidly ( @xmath101 ) at higher luminosities than that of unabsorbed agns ( @xmath102 ) .",

    "the difference might indicate that the area density at the low flux end of the distribution has been slightly overcorrected .",
    "one has to keep in mind that only a few sources derived from a small area of the sky are constraining the low flux end .",

    "integral _ are located close to the galactic plane and are more likely to belong to the galaxy : the second ibis / isgri soft gamma - ray survey catalog @xcite lists 55 new sources detected by _",
    "integral _ , of which 93% are located within @xmath34 . among these 55 sources ,",
    "3 are listed as extragalactic sources , 18 are of galactic origin , and 29 have not been identified yet .",
    "in addition , those objects which have been classified as agns based on soft x - ray and/or optical follow - up studies , are no more likely to be compton - thick objects than the overall agn population studied here .",
    "only four agns ( ngc 1068 , ngc 4945 , mrk 3 , circinus galaxy ) detected by _",
    "integral _ have been proven to be compton thick objects so far , and none of them showed absorbtion of @xmath132 . in order to clarify this point , observations at soft x",
    "- rays of those objects without information about intrinsic absorption are required for all _ integral _ detected agns ( tab .",
    "[ catalog ] ) . at present 23 % of the _ integral",
    "_ agn are missing absorption information .",
    "a first indication of what the absorption in these sources might be , can be derived from comparison of the _ integral _ fluxes with _",
    "rosat _ all - sky survey ( rass ) faint source catalogue data @xcite .",
    "in order to do so we assumed a simple power law with photon index @xmath133 between the _ rosat _ @xmath134 band and the _ integral _ @xmath6 range and fit the absorption . in the six cases where no detection was achieved in the rass ,",
    "an upper limit of @xmath135 has been assumed , resulting in a lower limit for the absorption @xmath136 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : nhhisto ] we show the distribution of intrinsic absorption .",
    "it has to be pointed out that the estimated values can only give an idea about the distribution of intrinsic absorption and should not be taken literally , as the spectral slope between the measurements is unknown and the observations are not simultaneous .",
    "nevertheless apparently none of the rass detections and non - detections requires an intrinsic absorption of @xmath137 .",
    "therefore it appears unlikely that a significant fraction of _ integral _ agns will show an intrinsic absorption @xmath138 .",
    "however , if we assume that the rass non - detections are all compton thick agns , the fraction of this class of sources rises from 6% to 16% when considering all 63 non - blazar agns seen by _ integral _ , and from 8% to 13% for the complete sample with 38 objects .",
    "this is in good agreement with the fraction of 11% of compton thick agn as seen in the _",
    "swift_/bat survey @xcite .",
    "the picture is less clear when referring to the optical classification . here",
    "the _ integral _",
    "survey finds 12 seyfert 1 ( 33% ) , 14 seyfert 2 , and 10 intermediate seyfert 1.5 in the complete sample , while the _ swift_/bat survey contains only 20% of type 1 seyfert galaxies .",
    "it should be pointed out though that the classification based on intrinsic absorption gives a more objective criterion in order to define agn subclasses than the optical classification with its many subtypes .",
    "the finding of the bat survey that virtually all sources with @xmath139 are absorbed , can not be confirmed by our study , in which we detect a fraction of @xmath126 of sources with @xmath140 among the sources below this luminosity .",
    "this also reflected in the observation that although the absorbed sources become more dominant below this luminosity , the trend is not overwhelmingly strong ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lumiabsorbed ] ) .",
    "most investigations to date have been focused on the x - rays below 20 kev , and _ integral _ can add substantial information to the nature of bright agns in the local universe . considering the expected composition of the hard x - ray background , it does not currently appear that the population detected by _",
    "integral _ can explain the peak at 30 kev , as compton thick agns are apparently less abundant than expected @xcite .",
    "but this picture might change if we assume that all _ integral _ agns lacking soft x - ray data and without counter parts in the rass to be compton thick .",
    "in addition the sample presented here might be still too small to constrain the fraction of obscured sources , and the missing compton thick agns could be detectable when studying sources with @xmath141 .",
    "the extragalactic sample derived from the _ integral _ public data archive comprises 63 low redshift seyfert galaxies ( @xmath142 ) and 8  blazars in the hard x - ray domain .",
    "two galaxy clusters are also detected , but no star - burst galaxy has been as yet .",
    "this _ integral _ agn sample is thus the largest one presented so far .",
    "38 of the seyfert galaxies form a complete sample with significance limit of @xmath33 .",
    "the number flux distribution is approximated by a power - law with a slope of @xmath4 .",
    "because of the high flux limit of our sample the objects account in total for less than @xmath143 of the @xmath6 cosmic x - ray background .",
    "the emissivity of all agns per unit volume @xmath10 appears to be consistent with the background estimates in the 210 kev energy band based on the cross - correlation of the _ heao 1_-a2 map with _ iras _",
    "galaxies @xcite .",
    "the luminosity function in the @xmath6 energy range is consistent with that measured in the @xmath11 band . below the turnover luminosity of @xmath9 the absorbed agns",
    "become dominant over the unabsorbed ones .",
    "the fraction of compton thick agns with known intrinsic absorption is found to be small ( @xmath144 ) in our agn sample .",
    "for the sources without reliable absorption information we derived an estimate from the comparison with _ rosat _ all - sky survey data and find that the data do not require additional compton thick objects within the sample presented here .",
    "it has to be pointed out though , that the sources without rass counterpart could be compton thick which would increase the ratio of this source type to 13% in the complete sample .",
    "evolution of the source population can play a major role in the sense that the fraction of absorbed sources among agns might be correlated with redshift , as proposed for example by worsley et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . over the life time of the _ integral _",
    "mission we expect to detect of the order of 200 agns . combining these data with the studies based on _",
    "swift_/bat , operating in a similar energy band as ibis / isgri , will further constrain the hard x - ray luminosity function of agns . but we will still be limited to the relatively high flux end of the distribution . because of this _ integral _ and _ swift_/bat will most likely not be able to test evolutionary scenarios of agns and thus will be inadequate to explain the cosmic x - ray background at @xmath145 .",
    "future missions with larger collecting areas and/or focusing optics will be required to answer the question of what dominates the universe in the hard x - rays .",
    "vb would like to thank olaf wucknitz for providing software to handle the @xmath146 cosmology .",

    "<S> we have compiled a complete extragalactic sample based on @xmath0 to a limiting flux of @xmath1 ( @xmath2 to a flux limit of @xmath3 ) in the 20  40 kev band with _ integral_. we have constructed a detailed exposure map to compensate for effects of non - uniform exposure . the flux - number relation is best described by a power - law with a slope of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the integration of the cumulative flux per unit area leads to @xmath5 , which is about 1% of the known @xmath6 x - ray background . </S>",
    "<S> we present the first luminosity function of agn in the 2040 kev energy range , based on 38 extragalactic objects detected by the imager ibis / isgri on - board _ integral_. the luminosity function shows a smoothly connected two power - law form , with an index of @xmath7 below , and @xmath8 above the turn - over luminosity of @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the emissivity of all _ integral _ agns per unit volume is @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> these results are consistent with those derived in the @xmath11 energy band and do not show a significant contribution by compton - thick objects . because the sample used in this study is truly local ( @xmath12 ) , only limited conclusions can be drawn for the evolution of agns in this energy band . </S>"
