    "the first evidence of a relatively young age for pal  12 was given by go88 , who estimated that pal 12 must be 30% younger than 47  tuc on the basis of an atypically small value of the magnitude difference between the hb and the to .",

    "@xmath103 linearly depends on the logarithm of age .",
    "the @xmath115  mag level has been chosen after an analysis of the behavior of the to - rgb color difference with respect to the age .",
    "we have repeated our measurements at the rgb levels marked by dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ age1 ] and found that , if a value @xmath116 is taken , the sgb plays an important role , making relative measurements difficult to interpret .",
    "the same occurs for @xmath117 , where the slope of the rgb becomes very sensitive to the clusters metallicity .",
    "conversely , for @xmath112 in the range @xmath118 $ ] and age older than 8 gyrs , the @xmath103 seems to be almost independent of metallicity .",
    "we simply chose a mean value @xmath115 .",
    "the linear relations in fig .",
    "[ age1 ] have the same slopes for @xmath67 , while for @xmath104 the b94 and v98 models give the same slope , which is slightly different from that obtained from s97 .",
    "the zero points are different , but this does not affect the relative age determination . we will therefore obtain the same relative ages when using either the b94 , v98 or s97 models at @xmath67 , while the s97 isochrones give age differences larger by @xmath119 than b94 or v98 at z=0.003 .    from fig .",
    "[ age1 ] we have @xmath103=0.280 for m5 , @xmath111=0.265 for 47  tuc , and @xmath103=0.330 for pal 12 . assuming z=0.003 , from fig .",
    "[ age2 ] , we obtain that pal 12 is 34% , 34% , or 30% younger than 47 tuc on the basis of v98 , b94 and s97 models , respectively . as discussed above , adopting z=0.001 we have quite similar results : formally , pal 12 is 33% , 32% , or 32% younger than m5 .",
    "taking into account the errors in measuring the @xmath111 parameter ( estimated assuming an uncertainty of @xmath120 mag and @xmath121 mag in the magnitude and color of the to ) for both pal 12 and the reference clusters , the uncertainties in the relative ages is of the order of 10% .",
    "we conclude that pal  12 has an age @xmath122 that of a typical ggc , assuming that 47  tuc and m5 age are representative of the ages of the bulk of the ggc population ( buonanno et al @xcite ) .",
    "we have derived the density profile of pal  12 making radial star counts in equal number - of - stars steps .",
    "stars with high membership probability were selected as explained in sect .",
    "[ sec_cmd ] .",
    "the cluster center was determined in an iterative manner , by first computing a median of the @xmath18 and @xmath123 coordinates of the stars within an arbitrarily located circle of radius @xmath124 .",
    "next , a new circle was considered with its center corresponding to the just obtained median point .",
    "the process was repeated until two subsequently computed centers were coincident .",
    "the offset between our center and that given by hc80 is just @xmath125 in ra and @xmath126 in dec .",
    "the background level was estimated outside a suitably large distance from the cluster center , chosen with the following procedure .",
    "first , a king law was fitted to the observed profile , and a set of structural parameters was derived",
    ". then the procedure was repeated until the computed tidal radius was smaller than the radius used for the foreground estimate .",
    "the final result is shown in fig .",
    "[ profilo ] , where the filled circles represent the observed star counts and the solid line the best - fitting king law .",
    "the adopted morphological parameters are @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where the errors were estimated following the methods adopted by saviane et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , and represent the formal uncertainties of the fit .",
    "a more reliable estimate of the errors was computed by keeping the central density fixed and varying the other 2 parameters in a grid of values .",
    "the 90%  confidence ranges of the fit for the tidal radius and concentration are @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "an alternative estimate of the uncertainties of the parameters was obtained by changing the sky level by @xmath129 .",
    "the effect is to lower @xmath130 by @xmath131 and to change @xmath132 by @xmath133 .",
    "our structural parameters are significantly different from those published in trager et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ; the authors quote @xmath134 and @xmath135 , which imply a tidal radius @xmath136 . since stars belonging to pal  12 are clearly seen beyond this radial limit ( cf .",
    "[ cmds ] ) , it is clear that the trager s et al .",
    "tidal radius is too small . on the other hand ,",
    "the same authors had previously listed values closer to ours ( trager et al .",
    "@xcite ) , analyzing the same data used by trager et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore possible that the unconsistency comes from some typo in trager et al .",
    "( @xcite ) table .    as a final remark",
    ", we notice that a dip in the profile is observed in the very central region",
    ". this could be due to a slightly lower completeness as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec_cmd ] .",
    "we fitted the profile also removing the central 3 points , obtaining almost identical structural parameters .",
    "the first deep @xmath6 , @xmath7 ccd photometry for the galactic globular cluster palomar  12 has been presented .",
    "the wide field allowed us to sample the cluster stellar population well beyond the tidal radius .",
    "all stars in our field down to @xmath34  mag below the ms turnoff ( @xmath51 completeness level ) have been measured , allowing a clear definition of all the cmd sequences .      a direct comparison with homogeneous @xmath6 , @xmath7 cmds for 47  tuc and m5 shows that pal  12 is a young cluster .",
    "the computation of a precise relative age depends on the theoretical isochrones used , although differences of at most @xmath137 are found among the three models considered ( b94 , v98 and s97 ) .",
    "the comparison with the models shows that pal  12 age is @xmath138 that of the reference clusters .",
    "finally , our large field also allowed to obtain a radially complete number density profile for stars brighter than @xmath139 , and to compute improved structural parameters .",
    "the new morphological parameters are @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
