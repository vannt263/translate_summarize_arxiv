    "complex network has received an enormous amount of attention in recent years @xcite .",
    "scientists have become interested in the study of networks describing the topologies of wide variety of systems such as the world wide web , social and communication networks , biochemical networks and many more . based on complex networks",
    "many quantitative methods can be applied so as to extract the characteristics embedded in the system .",
    "one of the important quantitative methods is to analysis the community structure @xcite .",
    "distinct communities within networks can loosely be defined as subsets of nodes which are more densely linked , when compared to the rest of the network .",
    "nodes belonging to a tight - knit community are more than likely to have other properties in common . in the world wide web ,",
    "community analysis has uncovered thematic clusters . in biochemical or neural networks ,",
    "communities may be functional groups @xcite , and separating the network into such groups could simplify the functional analysis considerably . as a result , the problem of identification of communities has been the focus of many recent efforts .",
    "maximizing modularity @xmath0 is the most widely accepted method for detecting community structure among many algorithms @xcite , although modularity index has been proved that it may fail to identify small modules @xcite .",
    "modularity @xmath0 was presented as a index of community structure by newman and grive , which was introduced as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 are the fraction of links that connect two nodes inside the community @xmath5 , @xmath6 the fraction of links that have on or both vertices in side the community @xmath5 , and sum extends to all communities @xmath5 in a given network .",
    "note that this index provides a way to determine if a certain description of the graph in terms of communities is more or less accurate .",
    "generally speaking ,",
    "the larger the value of @xmath0 , the more accurate is a partition into communities .",
    "so maximizing modularity @xmath0 can detect community structures .",
    "there are many algorithms of maximizing @xmath0 directly such as extremal optimization ( eo ) @xcite , greedy algorithm @xcite and other optimal algorithm .",
    "in fact , they are usually heuristic algorithms for modularity maximization problem and this problem has been proved to be a npc in the strong sense by ulrik brandes _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "can we improve the efficiency of corresponding heuristic algorithms by detailed investigation of mathematic structure of modularity @xmath0 ? according to ref @xcite , @xmath7 can be simplified as @xmath8 . in this paper , we proved that @xmath8 is a nonconvex quadratic @xmath9 programming .",
    "assume @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the element of @xmath12 .",
    "then @xmath13 is equivalent to @xmath14 for all positive integer number @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 is a positive matrix , so the modularity maximization problem can map to a continuous nonconvex quadratic programming .",
    "these theorems will be detailed in section @xmath17 . in this way ,",
    "modularity maximization problem is equivalent to @xmath14 .",
    "we have done many numerical experiments on artificial and real - world networks such as physics - economics scientists cooperation network , e.coli network and collage football network , and found that a proper large @xmath15 is very helpful for two basic neighborhood transformation algorithms and eo algorithm for maximizing @xmath0 .",
    "it implies that our results has great possibility to enhance the efficiency of many heuristic algorithms .",
    "newman and givan proposed the modularity @xmath0 index based on the common experience that such networks seem to have communities in them : subsets of nodes within which node - node connections are dense , but between which connections are less dense @xcite . according to @xcite",
    ", modularity @xmath0 can be simplified .",
    "suppose we have a network @xmath18 which has @xmath19 nodes and can be represented mathematically by an adjacency matrix @xmath20 with elements @xmath21 if there is an edge from @xmath22 to @xmath23 and @xmath24 otherwise .",
    "@xmath25 denotes the degree of node @xmath22 and @xmath26 is a matrix , @xmath27 . without losing any generality",
    "we assume that the network @xmath18 has @xmath19 communities ( if the number of community is less than @xmath19 we can use @xmath28 to substitute ) .",
    "suppose @xmath29 is the community structure matrix , @xmath30 denotes the @xmath22 community , @xmath31 .",
    "for example : assume @xmath32 , it denotes that community @xmath22 only contains two nodes which are node @xmath17 and @xmath33 .",
    "because a node only belongs to one community , each row of @xmath34 just has one @xmath35 .",
    "we use @xmath36 to denotes the set of all possible @xmath34 .",
    "let @xmath37 , we easily have modularity maximization problem is equivalent to @xmath1 @xcite , where _ tr _ means _ trace _ which denotes the sum of diagonal entries of a matrix .",
    "now we will map the maximization modularity @xmath0 problem to nonconvex quadratic 0 - 1 programming .",
    "let @xmath38 , then @xmath1 can be write as :    @xmath39 + @xmath40    from the subject conditions we can easily get that the set @xmath36 contain @xmath41 elements , @xmath42 . according to the definition of @xmath43 we also have the corresponding set @xmath44 .",
    "* theorem1 * : let @xmath10 , then , @xmath45 problem is equivalent to the maximization problem of @xmath46 which can be map to a nonconvex quadratic continuous programming .",
    "* proof * :    @xmath47 .",
    "@xmath48 problem is equivalent to the maximization problem of    @xmath49 .    according to _ gerschgorin circle theory _",
    "@xcite , easily we have @xmath50 is a symmetrical positive matrix .",
    "@xmath49 is a continuous nonconvex quadratic programming @xcite .",
    "* theorem2 * : for all positive integer number @xmath15 , @xmath45 problem is equivalent to the maximization problem of @xmath2 .    *",
    "proof * : @xmath51    is equivalent to @xmath46    is equivalent to @xmath52    and @xmath53    @xmath54    is equivalent to @xmath55    is equivalent to @xmath56    is equivalent to @xmath2 .",
    "based on the theorem 2 , maximizing @xmath0 is equivalent to @xmath2 .",
    "can we enhance the efficiency of heuristic algorithms for maximizing modularity @xmath0 by changing it into this new maximizing problem with a proper large @xmath15 ?",
    "there are so many heuristic algorithm for maximizing modularity @xmath0 , we can not investigate all of them .",
    "if we could , we also can not promise our method satisfy the future heuristic algorithms .",
    "but it is well - know that , for many heuristic algorithms such as eo , potts @xcite and so on , their key methods are to find optimal neighborhood transformations , where neighborhood transformation means moving a node for one community to another community at each optimizing step .",
    "so if our method is effective on the basic neighborhood transformation algorithms , it will has great possibility to be effective on many other heuristic algorithms .",
    "there are two basic neighborhood transformation algorithms .",
    "one is random neighborhood transformation algorithm .",
    "we randomly initiate the beginning partition ( with sufficient number of groups ) , then at each step , randomly choose a node form one community and move it into another one that can make @xmath0 become larger , until moving any node can not make @xmath0 larger any more .",
    "the other algorithm is greedy neighborhood transformation algorithm .",
    "the corresponding process is similar with the process of random one , but the difference is that at each step , the node will be moved to a group that makes @xmath0 has the largest increment . we choose four different fields networks to test our method .",
    "one is the classical artificial random network which has @xmath57 nodes divided into @xmath33 communities of @xmath58 nodes each .",
    "edges between two nodes are introduced with different probabilities depending on whether the two nodes belong to the same community or not : every node has @xmath59 links on average to its fellows in the same community , and @xmath60 links to the outer - world .",
    "here we chose the artificial network with the diffuse community structures to test our method .",
    "it is because when the network contains clear community structure , @xmath15 has almost no effects on the final partition .",
    "the rest @xmath61 networks are scientists cooperation network @xcite , e.coli network @xcite and college football network @xcite .",
    "the results show that for a proper large @xmath15 , our method is helpful for finding large value of @xmath0 ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ expriments2 ] and fig .",
    "[ expriments3 ] ) .",
    "but it is hard to say it need more or less time in maximizing @xmath0 process .",
    "we also use the extremal optimization algorithm ( eo ) @xcite to test our method .",
    "eo was proposed by jordi duch and alex arenas , which is heuristic algorithm . in their algorithm , they define a fitness of each node .",
    "the fitness @xmath62 of node @xmath22 is defined as @xmath63 where , @xmath64 denotes the degree of node @xmath22 , and the @xmath65 is the contribution of individual node @xmath22 to the @xmath0 .",
    "assume @xmath66 denotes the @xmath19-dimensional vector in which the @xmath22th element is @xmath35 , others @xmath28 then @xmath67 for the maximization problem @xmath68 , the contribution is @xmath69 unfortunately , we can not use the function @xmath70 ( as eq .",
    "[ fitness ] ) to define the fitness , for it is not satisfy the original conditions ( see @xcite ) .",
    "so we define the new fitness function as the eq .",
    "[ contribution2 ]",
    ". moreover , jordi duch and alex arenas did nt define the ` optimal state ' quantitatively in @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we think a partition process has arrived the optimal state at step @xmath71 if the @xmath0 of @xmath71 is equal or larger than each @xmath0 from step @xmath72 to @xmath73 , where @xmath19 is the node number of a network .",
    "we investigate extremal optimization with new fitness function ( neo ) for different @xmath15 and compare the neo algorithm with the eo algorithm in the above four networks .",
    "the results show that the proper larger @xmath15 is very helpful both for maximizing modularity @xmath0 and reducing computing time , but sometimes the too large @xmath15 is not helpful ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ expriments ] ) .",
    "we guess one of the main reasons is that too large @xmath15 will bring more computing errors .",
    "value which is got by eo ( with original fitness function ) . from these plots",
    "we can conclude that large @xmath15 is very helpful in both maximizing @xmath0 and reducing time complicity .",
    "but sometimes too large @xmath15 will bring overdone effects such as the results in the collage football network.,title=\"fig:\",width=226,height=151 ] value which is got by eo ( with original fitness function ) . from these plots",
