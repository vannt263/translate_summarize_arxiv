    "the cuprate superconductors have attracted enormous interest not just because of their high temperature unconventional superconductivity but also because of their highly anomalous properties in the normal phase ( for a review see t. timusk and b. statt @xcite ) .",
    "these show strong deviations from standard landau fermi liquid behavior particularly in the underdoped region where the deviations are most evident in the pseudogap ( or spin gap ) phase . among the most spectacular of these deviations",
    "is the observation of a fermi surface in photoemission ( arpes ) experiments that consists , not of a closed contour , but only of 4 disconnected arcs centered on the brillouin zone diagonals .",
    "@xcite pseudogaps in the single particle spectrum truncate the fermi surface at the saddle points .",
    "in addition the density of charge carriers is determined not by the conduction electron density but by the hole density doped into the stoichiometric parent mott insulator .",
    "@xcite these facts indicate that the pseudogap phase should be viewed as an anomalous precursor to the stoichiometric mott insulator .",
    "very soon after the discovery of the high temperature superconductors and before these anomalous pseudogap properties were measured , anderson proposed that the key to understanding these unique materials lies in what he called resonant valence bond ( rvb ) behavior .",
    "@xcite he proposed a description based on lightly hole doped spin liquid of spin singlets .",
    "rather than forming a fixed array of singlets , strong quantum fluctuations among the antiferromagnetically coupled @xmath0 spins lead to a superposition of singlet configurations , i.e. the bond singlets resonate between many configurations .",
    "this elegant concept explains many key features of the pseudogap phase as emphasized in the recent review by anderson and coworkers .",
    "@xcite but the strong onsite correlations among the electrons in this precursor to a mott insulator are difficult to treat analytically .",
    "this has hindered the development of complete theory for the rvb phase and the cuprates in general .",
    "in this recent review@xcite , anderson and coworkers point out that the early renormalized mean field theory ( rmf ) introduced by zhang and coworkers@xcite for the rvb phase predicted many of its key features using simple gutzwiller renormalization factors to describe the strong correlations . in the intervening years",
    "much progress has been made on a first principle treatment of these correlations based on gauge theories ( for a review see lee , nagaosa and wen @xcite ) .",
    "the functional renormalization group ( rg ) approach developed by honerkamp and coworkers has also given new insights starting from weak coupling .",
    "@xcite however , we still lack even a consistent phenomenological description of this anomalous pseudogap phase that ties together key features analogous to the landau theory for standard fermi liquids .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to take a step in this direction . to this end",
    "we introduce an ansatz for the form of the self - energy and thereby for the form of the single particle green s function . in this",
    "we are guided by the recent theory by konik , rice and tsvelik ( krt ) for the form of the green s function in a doped spin liquid consisting of an array of 2-leg hubbard ladders coupled by long range inter - ladder hopping .",
    "@xcite by a careful choice of the form of this hopping , krt could justify a random phase approximation ( rpa ) to obtain the two dimensional green s function from the single ladder form .",
    "they showed that for a light doping away from one electron / site a novel form of the green s function , @xmath1 resulted .",
    "in particular they showed that the behavior of @xmath2 which enters the luttinger sum rule ( lsr ) @xcite , was quite distinct from that of a normal landau fermi liquid .",
    "the lsr relates the area enclosed by the contours where @xmath2 changes sign from positive to negative to the total electron density . in a landau fermi liquid , sign changes in @xmath3 occur only through an infinity in @xmath2 at a closed fermi surface . in the doped spin liquid",
    ", krt found that the sign changes occur not only through infinities on fermi pockets but also through zeroes lying on a separate surface which they call the luttinger surface of zeroes .",
    "the fermi pockets enclose an area determined by the hole density while the luttinger surface encloses an area given by the density of one electron per site in the parent stoichiometric ladders .",
    "this behavior followed from the form of the self energy in the coherent part of the single ladder green s function and its modification through the inter - ladder hopping processes .",
    "the single ladder green s function was derived by essler and konik only in the weak coupling limit .",
    "@xcite however , the fact that weak and strong coupling are continuously connected in ladders and that the form is qualitatively similar to that obtained numerically by troyer et al in strong coupling @xmath4 ladders @xcite , leads us to believe that this general form is characteristic of doped spin liquid and is not restricted to weak coupling .    in section 2",
    "we introduce our ansatz for the form of the self energy for a two dimensional lightly doped rvb spin liquid .",
    "our ansatz is based on a generalization of the krt form for the doped spin liquid formed in an array of 2-leg hubbard ladders .",
    "@xcite it also contains a luttinger surface of zeroes which encloses a commensurate density in addition to hole fermi surface pockets . in this case",
    "the luttinger surface coincides with the so - called umklapp surface introduced by honerkamp and coworkers honerkamp as the surface where umklapp scattering processes appear to open up a charge gap in the weak coupling rg flow .",
    "it is also interesting to note that this green s function is closely related to the form recently proposed by tai - kai ng @xcite .",
    "he started from the strong coupling limit and introduced spin - charge separation by factorizing single electron operators into a product of spinon and holon operators . following earlier work by wen and lee @xcite",
    "he introduced a phenomenological attraction between spinon and holon which leads to a binding between spinon and holon .",
    "he obtained a form for the green s function which also contains a coherent quasiparticle pole and has close similarities to our ansatz .    in section 3",
    ", we analyze the consequences of our ansatz for a variety of properties .",
    "first we obtain the hole density dependence of our psuedogap and other key parameters from the rmf results of zhang et al.@xcite based on these choices we obtain estimates of the hole density dependence of many observables , e.g. the fermi velocity @xmath5 and wavevector @xmath6 along the brillouin zone ( nodal ) direction , the minimum gap contour near the saddle point ( antinodal direction ) , the tunneling density of state ( dos ) , the drude weight , and the shape and form of the hole fermi pockets . from the phenomenological form of the green s function we obtain the quasiparticle dispersion and spectral weights that characterize the coherent part of the single electron green s function . a key point in our phenomenology",
    "is that there is a critical hole concentration above which the spin liquid anomalous self - energy vanishes . as consequence",
    "there is a form of quantum critical point ( qcp ) which separates two topologically distinct forms for the green s function . below the critical hole density , @xmath7",
    "is characterized by coexisting luttinger surfaces of zeroes and hole pocket fermi surface of infinities while above the critical concentration @xmath2 displays only a closed fermi surface of infinities as usual in a landau theory .",
    "many features of this qcp resemble those deduced by loram and coworkers from an analysis of a variety of experiments @xcite .    in section 4 ,",
    "we examine how this green s function is modified when the system enters a d - wave superconducting state .",
    "this again is introduced phenomenologically and no attempt is made here to derive the parameters of the superconductivity although we do offer a number of reasons why the hole pockets should have a d - wave superconducting instability .",
    "lastly section 5 is devoted to further discussions and conclusions .",
    "a doped rvb spin liquid has many properties which are quite distinct from the standard landau fermi liquid which follows from treating the interactions in perturbation theory .",
    "moreover these anomalous properties can not be ascribed to a broken symmetry or to the appearance of a new order parameter . as a result",
    "it is a challenge to construct a consistent theory even on the phenomenological level of a doped rvb spin liquid .",
    "we start with a brief review of the recent work by krt @xcite who could obtain the form of the single particle green s function @xmath1 in a doped spin liquid . in particular",
    ", they examined the form of the lsr which applies to the zero frequency green s function @xmath2 in the doped spin liquid .",
    "the key point about the lsr as emphasized in the famous textbook by abrikosov , gorkov and dzyaloshinskii ( agd ) @xcite and more recently by tsvelik @xcite , is that derivation of the lsr is very general and is not limited to perturbation theory .",
    "the lsr relates the total electron density , @xmath8 , to the area in the @xmath9-space where @xmath10 . in two dimensions it takes the form@xmath11an important point that these authors emphasized",
    "is that the sign change from positive to negative values of @xmath2 is not restricted to an infinity in @xmath2 such as occurs at the fermi surface of a landau fermi liquid .",
    "it can also occur through a zero in @xmath12 as , for example , in the case in the bcs theory of superconductivity .",
    "krt considered a doped spin liquid consisting of an array of two - leg hubbard ladders . at",
    "half - filling in a single ladder the fermi surface consists of four points without interactions , but it is completely truncated when the repulsive interactions which lead to both spin and charge gaps , are introduced .",
    "all spin and charge correlation functions are strictly short range so that this system is a true spin liquid .",
    "an explicit form for the single particle green s function has been derived by konik and coworkers in the limit of weak repulsion .",
    "@xcite around each of the four fermi points @xmath13 can be split into coherent and incoherent parts , @xmath14here @xmath15 is the bare dispersion near the corresponding fermi wavevector @xmath16 , @xmath17 is quasiparticle weight @xmath18 , and @xmath19 the single particle gap .",
    "note while the coherent part has a form similar to the diagonal green s function in bcs theory , there is no off - diagonal component of the green s function in this case .",
    "this general form is also compatible with the numerical results of troyer et al for the strong coupling limit @xcite .",
    "@xmath20 changes sign from positive to negative through a zero in @xmath20 which occurs when @xmath21 passes through zero as @xmath22 crosses @xmath16 , and the area with @xmath23 is unchanged by the interactions , satisfying the lsr .",
    "starting from this result , krt could derive @xmath24 for an array of 2-leg hubbard ladders coupled by a particular form of long range inter - ladder hopping chosen so that it could be treated using a random phase approximation ( rpa ) @xmath25where @xmath26 .",
    "they showed that this form , for values of @xmath27 large enough , leads to the appearance of electron and hole pockets distinct from the lines of zeroes in @xmath28 .",
    "the zero contours remain as lines at @xmath29 , independent of the transverse component of the wavevector , @xmath30 . in the presence of hole doping",
    ", the hole pocket expands and the electron pocket shrinks . in this doped spin liquid @xmath28",
    "has sign changes both through infinities along the fermi pockets and through zeroes located on the lines @xmath29 .",
    "note although the zeroes lines appear at incommensurate wavevectors in general and not at the brillouin zone as in a standard bloch insulator , the total area they enclose is commensurate and equals 1 electron /site , irrespective of the inter - ladder hopping strength .",
    "the final form obtained by krt for the coherent part is @xmath31this can be interpreted as a ladder self energy @xmath32 , where @xmath33 at the @xmath22-points where the gap opens up in the parent insulating two - leg hubbard ladder array .    in this work we consider doping a two - dimensional resonant valence bond insulator .",
    "we start from the rmf for such an insulator .",
    "this approximation treats the effect of strong correlations through renormalization factors calculated by a description that goes back to early work by gutzwiller gutzwiller .",
    "the renormalized @xmath4 hamiltonian takes the form of an effective hamiltonian @xcite@xmath34with the kinetic , @xmath35 , and spin energy terms modified by factors @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively @xmath38for a hole doping of @xmath39 per site . at half - filling @xmath40",
    "leaving only the magnetic energy .",
    "the rvb ansatz factorizes the spin energy introducing both fock exchange , @xmath41 and pairing , @xmath42 expectation values .",
    "the factorization procedure is not unique but the spin quasiparticle dispersion that results is unique , @xmath43 . upon hole doping @xmath44 , and coherent quasiparticle poles with a small weight @xmath36",
    "appear in the single particle green s function . by analogy with the krt form for the doped spin liquid discussed above",
    ", we make the following ansatz for the coherent part of @xmath45 in a doped rvb spin liquid @xmath46where @xmath47@xmath48eq.[pg ] is analogy to eq.[2leg2 ] for the coupled ladder system , and @xmath49 is analogy to @xmath50 in eq.[2leg2 ] . in the renormalized dispersion we include hopping terms out to 3@xmath51 nearest neighbor with coefficients @xmath52the rvb gap magnitude function @xmath53 is also taken from the rmf theory @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath54 represents a shift of the energy band so that the chemical potential is always the zero of the energy .",
    "we determine @xmath54 from the lsr on the total electron density .",
    "first we consider the limit of zero doping , @xmath55 . in this case @xmath56 and the quasiparticle dispersion reduces to the spinon dispersion and the quasiparticles have the vanishing weight in this limit in the single particle green s function , @xmath1 . at small but finite @xmath39 the zero frequency green s function @xmath57 that enters the lsr has lines of zeroes when @xmath58 .",
    "the luttinger contour of zeroes in @xmath59 then consists of straight lines connecting the points @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "this luttinger contour coincides with the antiferromagnetic ( af ) brillouin zone .",
    "but more relevantly it coincides with the umklapp surface which appears in functional rg calculations on the weak coupling 2d @xmath62 hubbard model .",
    "honerkamp @xcite , laeuchli and coworkers @xcite found that umklapp scattering processes in both particle - hole and particle - particle channel which connect points on this surface grew strongly at low energies and temperatures leading them to propose that an energy gap would open up on this surface below a critical scale . further because of a close analogy to the behavior found in the case of a half - filled 2-leg hubbard ladder , they proposed that this gap was not driven by long range order , but rather was a sign that a rvb spin liquid with short range order would form below a critical scale .",
    "thus our ansatz for the green s function is fully consistent with these proposals .",
    "a second feature that follows from our ansatz for @xmath63 is the appearance of hole pockets at finite hole doping .",
    "these will be reviewed in detail in the next section .",
    "the hole pockets define fermi surfaces where @xmath59 changes sign through infinities and contain a total area equal the hole density .",
    "the lsr is satisfied since the area with @xmath64 is bounded by the luttinger surface which contains 1 el / site , minus four hole pockets which have a total area related to the hole density .",

    "thus @xmath69 continues to have a luttinger surface of zeroes on the umklapp surface as in the normal rvb spin liquid .",
    "however , there is now an additional set of luttinger surfaces defined by the contour that satisfy @xmath72but these are just the fermi surface of the four hole pockets in the normal phase which have now been converted to a luttinger surface of zeroes in the superconducting state . thus the form eq.[[sc ] ] continues to satisfy the lsr .",
    "lastly we remark that along the brillouin zone diagonals both @xmath73 and @xmath68 vanish in our phenomenological form . as a result",
    "exactly along these directions there is only a single quasiparticle pole which crosses the fermi energy at a fermi wavevector determined by @xmath74 .",
    "our phenomenological form for @xmath75 in the normal and superconducting phases are similar but not identical to several other recent proposals .",
    "it is very close to the form tai - kai ng @xcite derived based on spin - charge separation but with an added phenomenological attraction between spinon and holon which leads to binding and therefore to quasiparticle poles and a self energy form similar to eq.[[sc_selfenergy ] ] .",
    "he , however , restricted his analysis to the case of only nearest neighbor hopping .",
    "earlier norman and coworkers from an analysis of arpes data on bscco samples around optimal doping introduced a d - wave superconducting self energy modified to included both normal state single particle scattering and pair scattering .",
    "@xcite recently honerkamp @xcite has speculated on an adaptation of the form introduced by norman et al to describe a truncation of the fermi surface through the opening of energy gap in the antinodal regions near @xmath60 , @xmath61 as a phenomenological description of the rvb spin liquid .",

    "the strength of the superconductivity is determined by the magnitude of the gap squared .",
    "we assume a simple parabolic form for @xmath140 @xcite to mimic experiment ( see fig.[deltasc_fig ] ) and the gap is scaled with the superconducting , @xmath141 .    :",
    "@xmath142.,width=264,height=226 ]    we begin by examining the form of the lsr in the superconducting state . by inspecting the function @xmath69 defined in eq.[sc ] we see at once that the denominator diverges on the contours defined by @xmath71 and by @xmath143 .",
    "these are the same lsr contours that occur in the normal state .",
    "the only difference is that the second set of contours now define zeroes of @xmath69 not infinities .",
    "the fermi surface of the hole pockets is gapped except along the nodal line where both @xmath144 .",
    "the form ( sc ) for @xmath145 then continues to satisfy the lsr .     and",
    "@xmath146 , there is a substantial part of the spectral weight located at the lower band , only a small part remains on the band closer to the fermi level as indicated in figspectrum_sc_fig.,width=340,height=302 ]    in the superconducting state the quasiparticle poles are given by solutions to a quartic equation@xmath147which results in a further splitting of the quasiparticle bands .",
    "these are illustrated in fig.[spectrum_sc_fig ] for a number of hole densities .",
    "the spectral weight redistribution is small when the original quasiparticle energies are away from the chemical potential .",
    "this can be seen for example in panel ( d ) of fig.[spectrum_sc_fig ] which shows the quasiparticle bands and their weight along the umklapp surface connecting @xmath148 .",
    "here we see comparable weights only when the hole fermi pockets are nearby .     in the superconducting state ( eq.[[sc ] ] ) along high symmetry directions .",
    "the thickness of the lines is proportional to the spectral weight @xmath99.,width=340,height=453 ]    the superconducting energy gap modifies the dos , @xmath149 . as illustrated in fig.[dos_sc_fig ] the opening of the superconducting gap along the fermi pockets ( shown in fig.[ls_sc_fig ] ) leads to a pseudogap in @xmath149 accompanied by van hove singularities at the gap maxima .",
    "note these van hove singularities do not occur at the usual antinodal @xmath150-points @xmath60 , @xmath61 but rather on the extremities of the hole fermi pockets .",
    "this is because the form eq.[[sc ] ] we chose for the superconducting state does not represent a merging of the two gaps @xmath151 and @xmath68 , rather both gaps keep their own identity .",
    "further consideration of this point would require a better microscopic understanding of the coexistence of d - wave superconductivity with the rvb spin liquid correlations than our simple phenomenological ansatz .     in the presence of a nonzero superconducting gap .",
    "the additional peaks closest to fermi level are determined by the superconducting gap which opens on the hole pockets for @xmath130 . for @xmath152",
    "the peaks come from the antinodal directions for @xmath153 , @xmath154.,width=340,height=453 ]    another clear feature in @xmath149 is the van hove singularity associated with antinodal saddle points in the rvb quasiparticle bands at negative energy .",
    "this feature does not appear in the stm experiments .",
    "this could be due to the strong local variations in the hole density .",
    "the ansatz for the green s function eq.[[pg ] ] is motivated in the first place by the form of the green s function derived recently by konik and coworkers @xcite for a doped spin liquid composed of an array of 2-leg hubbard ladders .",
    "a second important input is the renormalized mean field derived many years ago by zhang and coworkers @xcite . as emphasized recently by andseron and coworkers @xcite , the rmf ,",
    "although it treats the strong correlations simply by gutzwiller renormalization factors , agrees qualitatively and even at times quantitatively with the results of variational monte carlo ( vmc ) calculations using gutzwiller projected wavefunctions @xcite .",
    "the rmf and vmc calculations at finite doping rely on a broken symmetry to introduce a gap at the fermi energy .",
    "however , in the underdoped region the gap at the antinodal regions ( @xmath155 ) is much larger than the expected superconducting transition temperature @xmath141 as estimated for example by wen and lee @xcite .",
    "so one should expect this gap to persist in the normal state at temperatures @xmath156 , and so should be a property of the rvb spin liquid and not related to a broken symmetry .",
    "another key feature of the underdoped region is that the drude weight scales as the hole concentration . as a result",
    "the simplest explanation for these two properties is that the fermi surface is partially truncated in a doped rvb spin liquid rather like the partial truncation that occurs through spin density waves in @xmath157 and its alloys before the commensurate antiferromagnetic state is reached @xcite . here",
    "the key difference to the @xmath157 alloys is the absence of a broken symmetry and long range order .",
    "theses properties are reconciled by our ansatz for the normal state . in the superconducting state we introduced @xmath158 and @xmath159 as separate gaps whereas in the rmf and vmc calculations",
    "there is only a single gap function opening up along a single fermi surface .",
    "so it would appear that our ansatz is qualitatively different to the rmf and vmc theories in the superconducing state .",
    "however , one can not be sure of this since the key quantity is the zero frequency green s function @xmath2 which is not directly available from a variational wavefunction .",
    "we note that there have been recent reports on the numerical study of the pseudogap phase by using cluster perturbation theory ( cpt ) @xcite and by the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) @xcite of the 2-dimension hubbard model .",
    "our ansatz does not deal with the origin of the d - wave superconductivity _ per se_.",
    "the relevant issue is the stability of the normal state as a doped rvb state .",
    "this issue was addressed in the case of the doped array of 2-leg hubbard ladders by krt @xcite .",
    "they showed that strong residual interactions acting on the hole pockets lead to a d - wave superconducting state or possibly a spin density wave state depending on the parameters .",
    "there is strong reason to believe that similar effects should occur here in the 2-dimensional doped rvb spin liquid .",
    "indeed such effect were conjectured by honerkamp @xcite , laeuchli and coworkers @xcite in their analysis of the functional rg calculation for the 2-dimensional @xmath160 hubbard model . on a qualitative level we know that the rvb spin liquid has enhanced response in both d - wave pairing and antiferromagnetic channels so that the fermi pockets are moving in a background which is highly polarizable in both these channels which can lead to corresponding instabilities .",
    "the challenge is to develop a proper microscopic theory to describe the competition between the two instabilities .",
    "note unlike the case of heavy fermions where a superconducting dome straddles the qcp associated with onset of long range af order @xcite , here superconductivity seems to be most stable near the onset of the rvb phase with short range correlations .",
    "the good agreement that this ansatz displays with many properties of the anomalous normal state in the pseudogap region is evidence that it contains at least elements of the correct physics .",
