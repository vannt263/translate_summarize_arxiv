    "in the last @xmath0 years , detailed investigation of several aspects concerning the black hole ( bh ) physics were carried out .",
    "the thermodynamics of bhs has been one of most active research lines in theoretical physics .",
    "the pioneering work of bekenstein @xcite has shown that the bh entropy is proportional to its surface area .",
    "thereafter , analyzing the origin of bh s entropy following the quantum mechanics , hawking @xcite showed that the bh has a thermal radiation with a temperature @xmath1 ( @xmath2 surface gravity ) . hawking also suggested that the majority of the information concerning the initial states is protected behind the event horizon .",
    "the information will not be back to the asymptotic region far from the evaporating bh @xcite . from these initial works ,",
    "several discussions on the thermodynamics of bhs @xcite have arisen .    however , in spite of the progress that the theoretical physics has accomplished in the understanding of this issue , a complete explanation for the final state of a bh after the evaporation remains unknown .",
    "the final piece of the puzzle should be a quantum gravity theory ( qgt ) .",
    "one of the main candidates for qgt is the string theory .",
    "it is known that when we have a magnetic background in string theory , the resulting algebra acquires noncommutative ( nc ) features . due to string - bh correspondence principle @xcite and some other results concerning noncommutativity @xcite , there is a whole literature approaching the so - called noncommutative black holes ( ncbh ) @xcite .",
    "a powerful way to describe ncbhs is through the so - called generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) @xcite .",
    "when quantum gravitational effects are taken into account the usual heisenberg uncertainty principle is modified @xcite .",
    "thus gup provides a minimal length scale and therefore change the thermodynamics of a singular bh at the planck scale .",
    "the gup imply yet in the nonvanishing of the position coordinates commutator .",
    "this noncommutative property is described by a nc parameter , which lies at the planck scale .",
    "the ncbhs that emerges from the noncommutativity of the space - time at small scales @xcite are analogous to a nonsingular bh with two horizons @xcite .",
    "alternatively , another way to deal with a bh is through the holographic principle , which merges the effects of quantum mechanics and gravity @xcite .    in this work",
    "we will use the entropic gravity formalism , in which gravitation is obtained from thermodynamic properties of a holographic surface @xcite to obtain the modifications on the gravitational field from the thermodynamics of ncbhs . from the nc corrections",
    "we will obtain a modified friedmann equation and the we will constrain the nc parameter to some of the most recent observational data .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we will discuss briefly the thermodynamics of ncbhs ; in section 3 we will present the nc corrections on the gravitational field following the entropic gravity formalism and derive the equations for friedmann - robertson - walker universe ; in section 4 we will investigate the feasibility of the model connected to the latest observational data ; in section 5 we will present our conclusions . in this paper",
    "we will use the natural unit system : @xmath3 . as usual",
    ", we will adopt the convention that a @xmath4 subscript attached to any quantity means that it must be evaluated at present time .",
    "in a nc space - time , the commutator between the position coordinates is given by    @xmath5=i\\theta^{\\mu\\nu},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath6 is the so - called nc parameter .",
    "in the string theory , this commutator shows that the coordinates of the target space - time become nc operators on a d - brane .",
    "the product of two fields on this nc space - time is replaced by the moyal product of commutative fields @xcite , given by @xmath7 f(x+\\alpha)g(x+\\beta)\\biggrb\\}\\bigglb|   _ { \\alpha=\\beta=0}\\nonumber\\\\ & = & f(x)g(x ) +   \\frac{i}{2}\\theta^{\\mu\\nu}\\partial _",
    "\\mu f(x)\\partial_\\nu g(x)\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\mathcal{o}(\\theta^2).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the original commutative metric for a schwarzchild bh solution is @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the bh mass . in the vierbeins representation",
    ", the metric tensor @xmath10 can be written as @xmath11    thus , a ncbh solution can be obtained by redefining eq.([vie ] ) as @xcite : @xmath12    in what follows we will consider the case in which the non - vanishing components of @xmath6 are @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in this case , the non - vanishing components of the metric tensor ( [ gnc ] ) are given by @xmath15    from eqs .",
    "( [ gco ] ) , it is possible to show that the entropy of a nc schwarzchild bh is given by @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the entropy of the commutative schwarzchild bh and @xmath18 is the entropy of the nc schwarzchild bh .",
    "according to verlinde s hypothesis @xcite , the tendency of any system to increase their entropy ( the second law of thermodynamics ) is the origin of gravity and leads to the emergence of space - time .",
    "in fact , this approach helps us to provide a thermodynamic description of the gravitational field equations in various theories @xcite . since the entropy formula plays a key role in this approach",
    ", any modification of the system entropy may affect the gravitational field equations and therefore the corresponding friedmann equations @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is worthwhile mentioning here that verlinde s interpretation of the origin of gravity and space - time is in line with both the generalized entropy formula and its corresponding cosmology @xcite .    in order to use verlinde s approach ,",
    "we need to evaluate the entropy of the system . for this purpose , consider a system of energy @xmath19 enclosed by the surface @xmath20 . by generalizing eq . to the system boundary ,",
    "a surface of radii @xmath21 assumed to be the holographic screen @xcite , the entropy of the system is given by @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the surface area of the boundary and @xmath24 is the nc parameter .",
    "since the boundary surface consists of @xmath25 degrees of freedom , we can write @xcite @xmath26    where @xmath27 is a constant proportional to the square of planck length @xmath28 . according the energy equipartition theorem ,",
    "the source energy content is distributed on the surface degrees of freedom as @xcite @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the surface temperature . combining eqs .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) and  ( [ 8 ] ) we have that @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the gravitational mass of the source .",
    "according to verlinde s approach @xcite , this tendency of the source to increase its entropy implies that the force acting on a test particle of mass @xmath33 is given by @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the displacement of the test particle from the holographic screen @xmath20 and the minus sign is due the inward nature of the entropy flux @xcite .",
    "if the distance between the test particle and the holographic surface is of the order of magnitude of its compton wavelength @xmath36 , the particle is absorbed by the holographic screen leading to an increase of the system entropy @xcite . in this case , we can set @xmath37 , with @xmath38 . finally , from ( [ ent1 ] ) , ( [ 7 ] ) , ( [ 9 ] ) and ( [ 10 ] ) we obtain @xmath39    where we have used the fact that @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "the newtonian limit , @xmath41 , obtainable when @xmath42 , yields @xmath43 .",
    "thus , the gravitational force    acting on a particle of mass @xmath33 in the holographic screen is @xmath44    and , as the gravitational force is attractive , this fact constrains the nc parameter to have values in the range @xmath45 .",
    "the gravitational potential energy and the kinetic energy of the test particle are , respectively , @xmath46    and @xmath47    now , let us apply the above results for an homogeneous and isotropic expanding universe . in this case , the radius @xmath48 can be written in terms of the comoving distance @xmath49 as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the scale factor . writing the source mass as @xmath52 , the energy conservation for the test particle can be written as @xmath53    multiplying both sides by @xmath54 and rearranging the terms we can write that @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the hubble parameter and @xmath57 .",
    "as we can see , the above equation is a modified version of the friedmann equation , which is obtained in the limit @xmath58 .",
    "thus , in the entropic gravity formalism , the nc of the space - time affects the way the universe evolves .",
    "since the energy stored in the source is @xmath59 , the first law of thermodynamics reads as : @xmath60.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    assuming a reversible expansion , @xmath61 , is easy to show that @xmath62    in the above equations , @xmath63 is the pressure of the fluid . by combining ( [ friedmann_eq ] ) and ( [ fluid_eq ] )",
    "we obtain the acceleration equation as being @xmath64    summarizing , the final effect of the nc entropic cosmology is the modification of the newton constant , @xmath65 to @xmath66 in the usual field equations .",
    "in order to probe the viability of the cosmological scenario developed in the previous section we will consider a spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker universe dominated by a pressureless matter ( baryonic plus dark matter ) as well as the energy of the quantum vacuum ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "concerning these considerations the eq .",
    "( [ friedmann_eq ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath68,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath69 denotes the current fractional densities of radiation , non - relativistic matter and quantum vacuum , respectively . in this case",
    ", the normalization condition reads @xmath70    note that in the absence of the nc corrections , the standard @xmath71cdm model is recovered , as expected .    in what follows",
    ", we will perform an observational analysis of the above model . in order to constrain the model parameters we use some cosmological probes that map the late - time universe expansion history .",
    "the data used in our analysis are : the  joint light curves \" ( jla ) sample @xcite which comprises 740 type ia supernovae in the redshift range @xmath72 $ ] ; the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) measurements from the six degree field galaxy survey ( 6df ) @xcite , the main galaxy sample of data release 7 of sloan digital sky survey ( sdss - mgs ) @xcite , the lowz and cmass galaxy samples of the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss - lowz and boss - cmass , respectively ) @xcite and the distribution of the lymanforest in boss ( boss - ly ) @xcite ; the cosmic chronometers ( cc ) data set , which contains 30 measurements of @xmath73 covering the redshift range @xmath74 @xcite ; and the recent measurement of the hubble constant , @xmath75 @xcite",
    ".    we will use class @xcite and monte python @xcite codes to perform the statistical analysis of the model for the combined data set : jla + bao + cc + @xmath76 . in order to obtain correlated markov chain monte carlo samples from class / monte python code",

    "however , the standard @xmath71cdm model still remains in good agreement with the data since @xmath91 at 2@xmath78 confidence level .",
    "therefore , it s characterized , at least for the data combination used in this paper , that nc effects , encoded in the parameter @xmath92 , can not be ruled out . figure [ fig2 ] shows the effects of the parameter @xmath79 on the expansion rate of the universe front to the cc data .",

    "to explain the current accelerated phase of the universe is one of the main challenges of the theoretical physics nowadays",
    ". the knowledge acquired in many areas of physics has been put together and it was applied to cosmology in the hope that a better understanding of the physics behind the cosmic acceleration can be achieved .    considering this line of research",
    ", we have investigated the implications of a nc geometry to the late time expansion of the universe from the entropic gravity perspective . in the entropic gravity formalism developed by verlinde @xcite",
    ", the origin of the gravitational field is associated with the perturbations in the information manifold due to particles motion connected to the holographic screen .",
    "since the noncommutativity of the space - time changes the value of the black hole entropy , the gravitational field emerging from the entropic principle will be different from the usual newtonian gravitational filed .",
