    "rough surfaces play an essential role in many physical phenomena including wave scattering @xcite , friction @xcite , adhesion @xcite , electrical conductivity @xcite , capacitance @xcite and heat transport @xcite , and in applications ranging from thin films to sensors @xcite .",
    "the most direct way to measure morphology of rough surfaces is by scanning probe microscopy ( spm ) @xcite .",
    "however , probe size sometimes limits scanning resolution , in which case spm images represent a convolution of probe tip and intrinsic sample geometry @xcite .",
    "light scatter , which is faster and less invasive than spm , can also measure surface roughness via the inverse wave scattering method @xcite .",
    "the spatial resolution of the scattering technique can easily be adjusted to a desired level by tuning the incident wavelength @xmath0 .",
    "one of the most important parameters for describing rough surfaces is the height correlation function @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote height above a mean surface height @xmath4 at horizontal positions @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , and @xmath7 is the variance of @xmath8 . the average is performed over @xmath5 for fixed @xmath9 .",
    "other roughness parameters such as correlation length and roughness exponent can be derived from @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "chandley @xcite first showed that @xmath10 could be obtained from a 2d fourier transform of far - field scattered light intensity .",
    "however , a time - consuming series of measurements of scattered intensity profiles for a wide range of incident angles was required . in chandley",
    "s method , the height autocovariance function of the scattered wavefront is considered to be the same as the height autocovariance function of the rough surface .",
    "this assumption , however , is only valid when wave vectors of incident and scattered light are close to the surface normal .",
    "moreover , chandley s method was only practical for @xmath11 .",
    "@xcite modified chandley s method based on kirchhoff s approximation and showed that @xmath10 could be estimated rapidly from a _ single _ measurement of scattered intensity along a linear detector array , for a single , arbitrary , fixed incident angle @xmath12 ( see fig .  1 ) and an arbitrary wavelength @xmath0 without the restriction of @xmath11 . zamani _",
    "@xcite developed a rigorous mathematical foundation within kirchhoff theory , using a saddle point approximation for calculating @xmath10 of very rough surfaces from scattered light intensity measured along a special ( in general curved ) path along which both polar ( @xmath13 ) and azimuthal ( @xmath14 ) scattering angles ( defined in fig .",
    "1 ) varied .",
    "however , zamani s expression for @xmath10 was not compared directly with that derived in ref .",
    "@xcite , nor with experimental results .",
    "@xcite developed an approach for obtaining @xmath10 from the angular dependence of the mean differential reflection coefficient of a one - dimensional randomly rough dielectric surface , also in the kirchhoff approximation .    in this paper , we derive a simple analytic relation between @xmath10 and diffuse scattered intensity @xmath15 using a different mathematical approach than ref .",
    "@xcite , although still in the framework of inverse scattering theory in the kirchhoff approximation .",
    "our expression relates @xmath10 straightforwardly to @xmath15 in a simple experimental geometry : fixed polar scattering angle @xmath16 , measured as a function of azimuthal scattering angle @xmath14 between specular ( @xmath17 ) and an arbitrary angle far from specular direction .",
    "however , the derived relation between @xmath10 and @xmath15 differs from that of ref .",
    "we demonstrate the accuracy of our expression by obtaining @xmath10 from measured scattered intensity for surfaces whose correlation functions were obtained independently by atomic force microscopy ( afm ) , and comparing the results with @xmath10 obtained from the expression in ref .",
    "the comparison shows that the present expression is less reliant on accurate , large-@xmath14 , low - level scatter data , and thus avoids unphysical fluctuations at @xmath18 m that can arise with the @xmath10 expression of ref .",
    "@xcite when the @xmath14 measurement range is restricted",
    ". moreover , our optically extracted @xmath10 agrees significantly better with afm measurements than the ref .",

    "in the following derivation , for simplicity , we restrict our attention to self - affine fractal rough surfaces  _ i.e. _ surfaces for which the height difference @xmath20 between two points @xmath21 and @xmath22 is related to their separation @xmath23 by a power - law @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the roughness exponent @xcite .",

    "since @xmath52 and @xmath58 are functions of three common parameters ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 ) , and @xmath52 also a function of @xmath63 , fixing @xmath58 imposes some limitations on @xmath52 .",

    ", it was important to ensure that the detector remained unsaturated over the entire dynamic range of scattered light intensity .",
    "to this end , we recorded each scattered intensity profile several times with different neutral density filters inserted in the path of the incident beam , so that the intense coherent peak and the weak tails of the diffuse profile were both recorded within the ccd s linear response range .",
    "we then assembled the composite profile from the separate recordings .",
    "the shape of the scattered intensity profile , and extracted roughness parameters , did not depend significantly on polarization of the incident beam . from the measured linearized total scattered intensity profile @xmath109 , we separately fitted the coherent central peak @xmath110 and diffuse profile @xmath111 , the latter from the edge of the central coherent peak out to the largest angle @xmath14 at which scattered light was detectable above noise . since samples were mounted on a translation stage , we measured scattered profiles at many different spots on the surface to determine the statistical variance of key roughness parameters .",

    "( [ zhao ] ) .",
    "second , the red curve agrees somewhat better with the afm ( black ) curve ( @xmath118=0.97 , standard deviation std=0.03 ) than the blue curve ( @xmath118 = 0.89 , std=0.11 ) .",
    "third , large fluctuations appear in the blue curve at large @xmath9 that are not present in the other @xmath10 curves .",
    "we attribute these fluctuations to truncation of large @xmath79 , and thus large @xmath14 , values when evaluating the integral in eq .",
    "( [ zhao ] ) . in principle , these fluctuations could be reduced by using a wider ccd camera , or by translating the ccd in the azimuthal direction and using long exposures to acquire data over a wider @xmath14 range .",
    "taken together , these differences demonstrate that eq .",
    "( [ cor1 ] ) can yield a more accurate @xmath10 than eq .",
    "( [ zhao ] ) when only low - exposure , low - azimuthal - angle data is available .",
    "further differences between eqs .",
    "( [ cor1 ] ) and ( [ zhao ] ) emerge when analyzing light scatter data from very rough ( @xmath19 ) surfaces .",
    "as an example , fig .",
    "5 shows @xmath10 functions extracted from a si surface with @xmath119 .",
    "the two light scatter analyses now diverge significantly from each other , the curve based on eq .",
    "( [ cor1 ] ) ( red ) agreeing much more closely ( @xmath118 = 0.98 and std=0.03 ) with @xmath10 obtained from afm ( black curve ) than the curve based on eq .",
    "( [ zhao ] ) ( blue ) .",
    "thus eq .",
    "( [ cor1 ] ) appears to yield more accurate @xmath10 than eq .",
    "( [ zhao ] ) for very rough surfaces .",
    "in summary , we introduce a method for calculating the height correlation function @xmath10 of a homogeneous rough surface in the framework of kirchhoff theory that yields better agreement with afm measurements over a wider range of roughness parameters than previous formulations .",
    "test measurements use a simple experimental geometry with a single ccd camera at a fixed polar scattering angle that is amenable to time - resolved measurements .",
    "the extracted @xmath10 is free of fluctuations at large @xmath9 that arise with previous analysis methods of comparable simplicity .",
