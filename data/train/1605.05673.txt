    "a lot of research efforts ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) have been aimed at developing approximate functionals that would cure this shortcoming and would ensure the fulfillment of the condition @xmath137 , where ea is the electron affinity , @xmath138 is the total energy of a system with @xmath66 electrons , and @xmath139 is the eigenvalue of the state to which the additional electron is added ; the number in parentheses indicates the total number of electrons in the system .",

    "we have excplicitly verified this for the vo defect : when calculations are performed in hse hybrid functional with a fraction @xmath141 ( which reproduces the band gap of gan ) , single - particle eigenvalues and total energy differences agree to within @xmath142 ev .",
    "note that when such comparison is made it is important to include finite - size supercell corrections @xcite not only on total energies , but also for single - particle eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of substituting total energy differences with eigenvalues can be explicitly verified for the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied defect states .",

    "we use the same convention also for single - particle eigenvalues . in the subscript we label eigenvalues of defect levels in the relevant spin - minority channel in order of increasing energy : @xmath150 ( @xmath75 state ) , @xmath151 ( lower @xmath76 state ) , @xmath152 ( higher @xmath76 state ) .",

    "the first `` excited '' state ( lowest - energy excitation ) corresponds to removing an electron from a lower - lying @xmath76 state and putting it into a higher lying @xmath76 state ( see fig .",
    "[ ccd-1 ] ) .",
    "following the same reasoning as for the neutral state , we can show that its energy is given by : @xmath163 however , this is not a real excited state , but simply the other branch of the @xmath162 manifold .",
    "the excited state we are looking for corresponds to removing an electron from the @xmath75 orbital ( which is the second highest - occupied orbital ) and putting it into a higher - lying empty @xmath76 .",
    "the electron removal energy is given by @xmath164 .",
    "the electron is added to a system with a configuration @xmath147 , which is the excited state @xmath85 of the neutral defect discussed above , whereby defect states 1 and 3 are empty , and state 2 is filled .",

    "we obtain energies of excited states in in@xmath131ga@xmath132n by subtracting the decrease of the @xmath75-@xmath76 splitting from @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",

    "for example , for @xmath171 ( band gap 2.34 ev ) , @xmath44 and @xmath45 decrease by 0.12 ev .",
    "like carrier capture , intra - defect transitions can occur radiatively or nonradiatively , and the two rates add up .",
    "for the case of carrier capture ( transition from a band edge to a defect level ) , radiative processes can be neglected as a contribution to shockley - read - hall recombination in group - iii nitrides ( see arguments in the main text ) .",
    "this has to be re - evaluated for intra - defect transitions .    the optical transitions @xmath172@xmath173@xmath172@xmath174 ( for the neutral defect ) and @xmath175@xmath176@xmath175@xmath177 ( for the negatively charged defect ) are dipole - allowed . within the franck - condon approximation the radiative transition rate",

    "we obtain @xmath186 s@xmath18 for the neutral defect , and @xmath187 s@xmath18 for the negatively charged defect .",
    "these rates put a lower bound on the overall transition rate .",
    "evaluation of nonradiative rates is more complicated . within the first order of electron - phonon coupling the nonradiative intra - defect relaxation rate is given by an expression analogous to eq .",

    "( [ eq : r ] ) is based on the harmonic approximation , we need to use a parabolic approximation for the potential energy surface , both in the ground state and in the excited state .",

    "[ ccd0 ] , the anharmonicity is significant . using the parabolic approximation for the @xmath146 state in the region @xmath190 , and using the right branch of the @xmath148 excited state , we arrive at a rate larger than @xmath191 s@xmath18 , which is significantly faster than the radiative relaxation .",
    "experimental information about spin - conserving intra - defect transitions in @xmath192-bonded materials is scarce .",
    "however , a few recent well - studied examples confirm that nonradiative intra - defect relaxation at infrared energies is very fast @xcite .",

    "<S> note that in the latter case , where most of the recombination is nonradiative , the presence of defects modifies the charge - neutrality condition and we can no longer take @xmath106 , an assumption used in deriving eqs .  </S>",

    "<S> our analysis shows that gallium - vacancy complexes are an important source of efficiency loss in nitride light emitters .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have found that electronic excited states can play a crucial role in shockley - read - hall recombination in wide - band - gap semiconductors . </S>",
    "<S> our example for gallium vacancy complexes in nitride semiconductors demonstrated that inclusion of excited states enhances nonradiative recombination rates by many orders of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that such mechanisms should be ubiquitous in wide - band - gap materials . </S>",
    "<S> excited states similar to the ones considered in this work can occur at cation vacancies and their complexes not only in nitrides , but also in oxides as well as carbide materials . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , excited states of defects can also affect recombination mechanisms other than the multiphonon emission process considered in this work . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in the so - called impurity auger process @xcite the recombination rates also decrease exponentially when the band gap of the material increases , seemingly making such processes unimportant for wide - band - gap materials . </S>",
    "<S> inclusion of excited states of defects could drastically change the impact of this mechanism as well .    </S>",
