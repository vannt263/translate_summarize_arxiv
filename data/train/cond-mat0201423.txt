    "many of the electron - electron interaction effects in simple metals and semiconductors can be understood by reference to the homogeneous electron - gas model .",
    "a central role is played by the electron - pair distribution function @xmath0 , which describes how short - range exchange and correlations enter to determine the probability of finding two electrons at a relative distance @xmath8.@xcite the mean potential energy of the electron gas can be calculated from @xmath0 and hence , through an integration over its dependence on the coupling strength , the total energy as well .",
    "thus , an accurate knowledge of this function is crucial for applications of density functional theory @xcite ( dft ) in various schemes that have been proposed to transcend the local density approximation ( lda ) in the construction of exchange and correlation energy functionals.@xcite    a precise definition of @xmath0 is through the average number of electrons contained in a spherical shell of radius @xmath8 and thickness @xmath9 centered on an electron at the origin , which is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the space dimensionality , @xmath12 the electron density , and @xmath13 the solid angle in @xmath11 dimensions ( with @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) .",

    "while this spin - average reflects the charge - charge correlations in the electron gas , the spin - spin correlations are described by the difference distribution function @xmath17/2 $ ] .",
    "early calculations of the pair distribution functions in the @xmath18 electron gas were based on the use of a bijl - jastrow correlated wave function for the ground state@xcite and on exploiting the fluctuation - dissipation theorem for a self - consistent determination from the charge and spin response functions.@xcite these early results were validated with the advent of the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) techniques,@xcite which have produced a wealth of accurate data on correlation and response functions over a wide range of coupling strength for both the @xmath18 @xcite and the @xmath19 @xcite case .",
    "the qmc data have in turn stimulated a number of further theoretical studies .    here we are specifically concerned with the approach proposed by overhauser @xcite for the evaluation of the value @xmath20 of the pair distribution function at contact . while @xmath21 vanishes on account of the pauli principle ,",
    "@xmath22 is determined by the two - body scattering events and in overhauser s model was obtained from the solution of an effective schrdinger equation for the relative motion of two electrons with antiparallel spins .",
    "earlier work had demonstrated an exact cusp condition @xcite relating the logarithmic derivative of @xmath7 at contact to the bohr radius , and had emphasized the importance of the electron - electron ladder diagrams@xcite in evaluating @xmath22 .",
    "the approach of overhauser has subsequently been used to evaluate @xmath22 in the @xmath19 electron gas,@xcite and has been extended by gori - giorgi and perdew @xcite to evaluate @xmath0 at finite @xmath8 in @xmath18 through an accurate numerical solution of overhauser s two - body schrdinger equation .",
    "their results are in good agreement with qmc data in the short - range part of @xmath0 .    in the present work",
    "we further develop this approach to the evaluation of the pair distribution functions by ( i ) adopting a self - consistent hartree scheme for the determination of the effective potential entering the two - body schrdinger equation ; and ( ii ) carrying out calculations for both a @xmath18 and a @xmath19 electron gas .",

    "this yields , however , huge differences in the magnitude of the scattering length . our results in the right - hand panel in figure [ fig6 ] should thus be regarded as being very sensitive to the details of the theory and hence as having limited quantitative value .",
    "in this section we briefly indicate how the approach that we have presented in sect .",
    "[ sec2 ] could be extended to deal with the pair distribution function in an inhomogeneous electron system , subject to an external scalar potential @xmath119 .",

    "the calculation of @xmath124 by means of a two - electron scattering problem remains in this case a genuine two - body problem .",

    "finally , a relation between @xmath124 and the two - electron scattering states @xmath131 is needed .",
    "this relation can in general be written in the following form : @xmath132 where the sum runs over all the occupied levels @xmath133 .",
    "the appropriate degeneracy factor @xmath134 for the eigenvalue @xmath133 is zero in the case @xmath135 , if @xmath131 is symmetric under the exchange @xmath136 .    for building the exchange and correlation energy functional in eq .",
    "( [ 25 ] ) , one needs to calculate the pair distribution function at each given coupling strength @xmath137 by repeating the procedure outlined above with @xmath138 . the density profile @xmath122 is needed at full coupling strength and requires to be obtained by a parallel dft procedure .",
    "the pair distribution function at full strength is , in itself , a very interesting quantity .    as an example of application of such scheme",
    ", we would like to mention the problem of a finite number of electrons confined in a quantum dot@xcite . in this case",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath133 are discrete and the summation procedure reported in eq .",
    "( [ summation ] ) corresponds to filling the lowest energy states with all the available electrons .",
    "another problem of interest is represented by a system of electrons confined in a quantum well , in cases where the electron dynamics is important also in the growth direction so that the confinement can not be handled by a simple reduction to @xmath19 .",
    "compared to the previous example , the summation procedure is in this case more involved .",
    "the difficulty comes from the fact that the motion in the transverse direction is free , and this implies that for each subband in the growth direction there is a dispersion in the transverse direction associated with the in - plane momentum .",
    "examples of such physical systems , which are in a sense intermediate between @xmath18 and @xmath19 , have been discussed for instance by ullrich and vignale  @xcite and by luin _",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "more generally , the possibility of testing theories of the exchange - correlation hole and of the exchange - correlation energy density in strongly inhomogenous electronic systems is opening up through novel applications of variational qmc methods  @xcite .",
    "in this work we have proposed an extension of overhauser s model for the electron - electron correlations in the @xmath18 electron gas on the basis of a self - consistent hartree approximation for the electron - electron scattering potential .",
    "we have confirmed that the model is quite accurately describing the short - range part of the exchange - correlation hole , as already demonstrated by gori - giorgi and perdew  @xcite , and shown that it can be usefully extended to cover the full range of interelectronic separation over an appreciable range of values of the coupling strength . as already noted in sect .",
    "[ sec3 ] , the accuracy of the present hartree approximation is limited to the range of values of @xmath1 below the development of a first - neighbor peak in the pair distribution function .",
    "we have also shown that the original proposal of overhauser yields a very accurate analytical formula for the electron - electron scattering length , and indicated how this approach could be extended to deal with the exchange - correlation hole in an inhomogeneous electron gas , leading perhaps to more accurate descriptions of the exchange - correlation energy functional .",
    "we have examined the usefulness of this approach in describing the exchange - correlation hole in the @xmath19 electron gas and the spin - resolved pair distribution functions in the @xmath18 electron gas . as may be expected , the hartree approximation is quantitatively useful in @xmath19 over a more limited range of coupling strength and has more limited accuracy in regard to the splitting of the exchange - correlation hole into its parallel- and antiparallel - spin components . with regard to these spin - resolved pair functions ,",
    "however , we feel that it is quite remarkable that a hartree approximation should already work as well as it does in our calculations .",
    "we may hope that major changes will not be needed to explicitly include many - body exchange corrections in the electron - electron scattering potential .",
    "we have also given some attention to the determination of the electron - electron scattering length in the @xmath19 electron gas .",
    "as is generally true for @xmath19 systems , the logarithmic dependence of the s - wave phase shift on @xmath139 at very low energy makes this problem a very delicate one .",
    "we have shown that the proposal made by verhaar _ et al_.   in the context of an atom - atom scattering process is just as useful in regard to electron - electron scattering .",
    "we are currently examining how the hartree scattering potential may be supplemented by explicit inclusion of corrections accounting for many - body exchange and correlations , with the main aims of ( i ) improving the quantitative account of the spin - resolved components of the exchange - correlation hole , and ( ii ) studying how a first - neighbor shell emerges with increasing coupling strength .",

    "<S> the model involves the solution of a two - electron scattering problem via an effective coulombic potential , that we determine within a self - consistent hartree approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we find numerical results for @xmath0 that are in excellent agreement with quantum monte carlo data at low and intermediate coupling strength @xmath1 , extending up to @xmath2 in dimensionality @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the hartree approximation does not properly account for the emergence of a first - neighbor peak at stronger coupling , such as at @xmath4 in @xmath5 , and has limited accuracy in regard to the spin - resolved components @xmath6 and @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> we also report calculations of the electron - electron s - wave scattering length , to test an analytical expression proposed by overhauser in @xmath3 and to present new results in @xmath5 at moderate coupling strength . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we indicate how this approach can be extended to evaluate the pair distribution functions in inhomogeneous electron systems and hence to obtain improved exchange - correlation energy functionals .    </S>",
