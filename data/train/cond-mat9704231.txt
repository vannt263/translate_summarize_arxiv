    "the accurate calculation of the electronic structure of materials starting from first principles is a challenging problem in condensed matter science since unfortunately , except for small molecules , it is impossible to solve many - electron problem without severe approximations .    for materials where the kinetic energy of the electrons is more important than the coulomb interactions , the most successful first principles method is the density functional theory ( dft ) within the local ( spin- ) density approximation ( l(s)da)@xcite , where the many - body problem is mapped into a non - interacting system with a one - electron exchange - correlation potential approximated by that of the homogeneous electron gas .",
    "it is by now , generally accepted that the spin density functional theory in the local approximation is a reliable starting point for first principle calculations of material properties of weakly correlated solids ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "the situation is very different when we consider more strongly correlated materials , ( systems containing f and d electrons ) . in a very simplified view lda",
    "can be regarded as a hartree - fock approximation with orbital - independent ( averaged ) one - electron potential .",
    "this approximation is very crude for strongly correlated systems , where the on - cite coulomb interaction between d- ( or f- ) electrons of transition metal ( or rare - earth metal ) ions ( coulomb parameter @xmath3 ) is strong enough to overcome kinetic energy which is of the order of band width @xmath4 . in the result lda gives qualitatively wrong answer even for such simple systems as mott insulators with integer number of electrons per cite ( so - called `` undoped mott insulators '' ) .",
    "for example insulators coo and la@xmath5cuo@xmath6 are predicted to be metallic by lda .",
    "the search for a `` first principle '' computational scheme of physical properties of strongly correlated electron systems which is as successful as the lda in weakly correlated systems , is highly desirable given the considerable importance of this class of materials and is a subject of intensive current research .",
    "notable examples of first principle schemes that have been applied to srongly correlated electron systems are the lda+u method @xcite which is akin to orbital - spin - unrestricted hartree - fock method using a basis of lda wave functions , ab initio unrestricted hartree fock calculations @xcite and the use of constrained lda to derive model parameters of model hamiltonians which are then treated by exact diagonalization of small clusters or other approximations @xcite .",
    "many interesting effects , such as orbital and charge ordering in transition metal compounds were successfully described by lda+u method @xcite . however for strongly correlated metals hartree - fock approximation",
    "is too crude and more sophisticated approaches are needed .",
    "recently the dynamical mean - field theory was developed @xcite which is based on the mapping of lattice models onto quantum impurity models subject to a self - consistency condition .",
    "the resulting impurity model can be solved by various approaches ( quantum monte carlo , exact diagonalization ) but the most promising for the possible use in `` realistic '' calculation scheme is iterated perturbation theory ( ipt ) approximation , which was proved to give results in a good agreement with more rigorous methods .",
    "this paper is the first in a series where we plan to integrate recent develompements of the dynamical mean field approach with state of the art band structure calculation techniques to generate an `` ab initio '' scheme for the calculation of the electronic structure of correlated solids . for a review of the historical development of the dynamical mean field approach in its various implementations",
    "see ref @xcite . in this paper",
    "we implement the dynamical mean - field theory in the iterated perturbation theory approximation , and carry out the band structure calculations using a lmto basis .",
    "the calculational scheme is described in section 2 .",
    "we present results obtained applying this method to la@xmath0sr@xmath1tio@xmath2 which is a classical example of strongly correlated metal .",
    "in order to be able to implement the achievements of hubbard model theory to lda one needs the method which could be mapped on tight - binding model .",
    "the linearized muffin - tin orbitals ( lmto ) method in orthogonal approximation @xcite can be naturally presented as tight - binding calculation scheme ( in real space representation ) :    @xmath7    ( @xmath8 - site index , @xmath9 - orbital indexes ) .",
    "as we have mentioned above , lda one - electron potential is orbital - independent and coulomb interaction between d - electrons is taken into account in this potential in an averaged way . in order to generalize this hamiltonian by including coulomb correlations ,",
    "one must add interaction term :    @xmath10    we neglected for a while exchange terms and dependence of coulomb parameter @xmath11 on the particular pair of orbitals @xmath12 . through the following",
    "we will assume that only for one shell @xmath13 of one type of atoms @xmath14 ( for example d - orbitals of the transition metal ions ) coulomb interaction will be taken into account ( @xmath15 ) , and in the following iesndex @xmath16 will be omitted .",
    "all other orbitals will be considered as resulting in the itinerant bands and well described by lda .",
    "such separation of the electronic states into localized and itinerant is close in spirit to the anderson model .    to avoid double - counting one must in the same time",
    "subtract the averaged coulomb interaction energy term , which we assume is present in lda .",
    "unfortunately there is no direct connection between hubbard model and lda ( because lda is based on the homogeneous electron gas theory and not on the localized atomic type orbitals representation ) and it is impossible to express rigorously lda - energy through d - d coulomb interaction parameter @xmath3 .",
    "however it is known that lda total energy as a function of the total number of electrons is a good approximation and the value of the coulomb parameter @xmath11 obtained in lda calculation agrees well with experimental data and results of the more rigorous calculations @xcite.that leads us to the suggestion that a good approximation for the lda part of the coulomb interaction energy will be :    @xmath17    ( @xmath18 total number of d - electrons )",
    ".    in lda - hamiltonian @xmath19 has a meaning of the lda - one - electron eigenvalue for d - orbitals .",
    "it is known that in lda eigenvalue is the derivative of the total energy over the occupancy of the orbital : @xmath20    if we want to introduce new @xmath21 where d - d coulomb interaction is excluded we must define them as : @xmath22    then new hamiltonian will have the form : @xmath23    in reciprocal space matrix elements of the operator @xmath24 are : @xmath25    ( @xmath26 is an index of the atom in the elementary unit cell ) .    in the dynamical mean - field theory",
    "the effect of coulomb correlation is described by self - energy operator in local approximation .",
    "the green function is : @xmath27^{-1}\\ ] ] ( @xmath28^{-1}$ ] means inversion of the matrix , integration is over brillouin zone , @xmath29 is chemical potential , @xmath30 is a volume of brillouin zone ) .    in the following",
    "we will consider paramagnetic case , orbital and spin degenerate system , so that self - energy @xmath31 does not depend on orbital and spin indexes .",
    "one can define effective anderson model green function through : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is effective impurity hybridization function . the effective medium `` bath '' green function @xmath34",
    "is defined as : @xmath35 ( @xmath36 is chemical potential of the effective medium ) .",
    "the chemical potential of the effective medium @xmath36 is varied to satisfy luttinger theorem condition : @xmath37    in iterated perturbation theory approximation the _ anzatz _ for the self - energy is based on the second order perturbation theory term calculated with `` bath '' green function @xmath34 : @xmath38    @xmath39 is a degeneracy of orbitals including spin , @xmath40 , matsubara frequencies @xmath41 @xmath42 integer numbers .",

    "it is enough to calculate expectation values , such as orbital occupancies @xmath45 , but in order to calculate spectral properties one need to know green function on the real axis .",
    "the real axis equivalent of equations ( [ sigma0 ] ) is much more complicated and hard to implement numerically than matsubara frequencies version .",
    "it is much more convenient to perform analytical continuation from imaginary energy values to the real ones . for such continuation",
    "we have used pad approximant algorithm @xcite .",
    "if one has a set of the complex energies @xmath72 @xmath73 and the set of values of the analytical function @xmath74 , then the approximant is defined as continued fraction : @xmath75 where the coefficients @xmath76 are to be determined so that : @xmath77 the coefficients @xmath76 are then given by the recursion : @xmath78 the recursion formula for continued fraction finally yields : @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81    we have found that the most convenient way is to use analytical continuation not for the green function @xmath82 but only for self - energy @xmath83 , and then to calculate @xmath82 directly on the real axis through the brillouin zone integration ( [ gftetra ] ) .",
    "we have applied the above described calculation scheme to the doped mott insulator la@xmath0sr@xmath1tio@xmath2 .",
    "latio@xmath2 is a pauli - paramagnetic metal at room temperature and below t@xmath84=125 k antiferromagnetic insulator with a very small gap value ( 0.2 ev ) .",
    "doping by a very small value of sr ( few percent ) leads to the transition to paramagnetic metal with a large effective mass .",
    "as photoemission spectra of this system also show strong deviation from the noninteracting electrons picture , la@xmath0sr@xmath1tio@xmath2 is regarded as an example of strongly correlated metal .",
    "the crystal structure of latio@xmath2 is slightly distorted cubic perovskite .",
    "the ti ions have octahedral coordination of oxygen ions and @xmath85-@xmath86 crystal field splitting of d - shell is strong enough to survive in solid . on fig.1 the total and partial dos of paramagnetic latio@xmath2 are presented as obtained in lda calculations ( lmto method ) . on 3 ev above o2p - band there is ti-3d - band splitted on @xmath85 and @xmath86 subbands which are well separated from each other .",
    "ti@xmath87-ions have d@xmath88 configuration and @xmath85 band is 1/6 filled .    as only @xmath85 band",
    "is partially filled and @xmath86 band is completely empty , it is reasonable to consider coulomb correlations between @xmath89electrons only and degeneracy factor @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( [ sigma0 ] ) is equal 6 .",
    "the value of coulomb parameter @xmath3 was calculated by the supercell procedure @xcite regarding only @xmath89electrons as localized ones and allowing @xmath90electrons participate in the screening .",
    "this calculation resulted in a value 3 ev .",
    "as the localization must lead to the energy gap between electrons with the same spin , the effective coulomb interaction will be reduced by the value of exchange parameter @xmath91=1 ev . so we have used effective coulomb parameter @xmath92=2 ev . the results of the calculation for x=0.06 ( doping by sr was immitated by the decreasing on x the total number of electrons ) are presented in the form of the @xmath85-dos on fig.2 .",
    "its general form is the same as for model calculations : strong quasiparticle peak on the fermi energy and incoherent subbands below and above it corresponding to the lower and upper hubbard bands .",
    "the appearance of the incoherent lower hubbard band in our dos leads to qualitatively better agreement with photoemission spectra .",
    "on fig.3 the experimental xps for la@xmath0sr@xmath1tio@xmath2 ( x=0.06 ) @xcite is presented with non - interacting ( lda ) and interacting ( ipt ) occupied dos broadened to imitate experimental resolution . the main correlation effect : simultaneous presence of coherent and incoherent band in xps",
    "is successfully reproduced in ipt calculation . however , as one can see , ipt overestimates the strength of the coherent subband .",
    "in this publication we described how one can interface methods for realistic band structure calculations with the recently developed dynamical mean field technique to obtain a fully `` ab initio '' method for calculating the electronic spectra of solids .    with respect to earlier calculations",
    ", this work introduces several methodological advances : the dynamical mean field equations are incorporated into a realistic electronic structure calculation scheme , with parameters obtained from a first principle calculation and with the realistic orbital degeneracy of the compound .    to check our method we applied to doped titanates for which a large body of model calculation studies using dynamical mean field theory exists .",
    "there results are very encouraging considering the experimental uncertainties of the analysis of the photoemission spectra of these compounds .",
    "we have used two relative accurate ( but still approximate ) methods for the solution of the band structure aspect and the correlation aspects of this problem : the lmto in the asa approximation and the ipt approximation . in principle , one can use other techniques for handling these two aspects of the problem and further application to more complicated materials are necessary to determine the degree of quantitative accuracy of the method .",
