    "several works have addressed the electron - phonon coupling to model the effect of vibrations on the optical properties of molecules @xcite , point defects @xcite and inter - band optical transitions in solids @xcite .",
    "this interaction is characterized , in most cases phenomenologically , by a spectral density function @xcite that is used to describe the dissipation dynamics due to acoustic phonons in a two - level system @xcite , the absorption @xcite and low temperature effects on the zero - phonon line transition @xcite in quantum dots that are strongly coupled to localized vibrations .",
    "there are few works that treat the electron - phonon interaction with microscopic models @xcite .",
    "the latter approach is particularly accurate for atomistic systems and highly demanded nowadays as researchers are able to engineer nanoscale devices where effectively few atoms are involved @xcite .",
    "therefore , a deep understanding of this interaction is needed for controlling and engineering the optical properties of such systems .    here",
    "we consider a microscopic model to study the electron - phonon interaction between the electronic states of a single negatively charged silicon - vacancy ( siv@xmath0 ) center in diamond and lattice vibrations .",
    "we focus on the effect of phonons on the optical properties , i.e. , the zero - phonon line ( zpl ) transition and the phonon sideband associated to the emission or photoluminescence spectrum . on section ii we introduce to the electronic states of the siv@xmath0 center for which the optical emission will be calculated .",
    "section iii describes the vibrational degrees of freedom of a finite size lattice and the electron - phonon interaction between vibrations and the electronic states .",
    "section iv introduces the model used to calculate the emission spectrum taking into account the symmetries of the electronic wavefunctions and vibrations .",
    "in particular , the spectral density function and its relation to the emission spectrum is introduced .",
    "section v discusses the role of symmetry on the defect and finally section vi takes into account these considerations to write the spectral density function for the siv@xmath0 center .",
    "in this section we present the bare ground and excited states from which the optical transitions will take place .",
    "the siv@xmath1 center is a point defect composed of six carbon atoms and an interstitial silicon atom .",
    "the symmetry group associated to this defect is the @xmath2 group , a subgroup of the host crystal symmetry group @xmath3 @xcite ( an equivalent group is @xmath4 ) . in particular , the inversion symmetry with respect to",
    "the silicon atom leads to irreducible representations ( ir ) of the @xmath2 group to be labeled by parity : @xmath5 ( @xmath6 gerade or even ) and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ungerade or odd ) representations @xcite .",

    "are @xmath10 ( gerade ) and @xmath11 ( ungerade ) are @xmath12 linear combinations of single electron orbitals associated to the carbon atoms @xcite , @xmath13 are @xmath14 orbitals associated to the silicon atom ( see figure  [ fig : configurationaldiagram ] ) , @xmath15 is a coefficient that indicates the contribution of the latter orbitals and it is estimated to be @xmath16 by ab initio calculations , and @xmath17 . thanks to inversion symmetry the excited and ground state can also be labeled by parity .",
    "the degenerate ground states @xmath18 and @xmath19 belong to the two - fold ir @xmath20 , respectively . meanwhile , the degenerate excited states @xmath21 and @xmath22 belong to the two - fold ir @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "these ground and excited states are energetically separated by the zero - phonon line energy @xmath24 ev @xcite .",
    "therefore , the electronic structure associated to the negatively charged siv@xmath1 is modeled by the following hamiltonian @xmath25 we do not include the effect of spin - orbit interaction , neither we include the spin degree of freedom as they are not relevant for determining the broad features of the optical lineshape .",
    "in this section we derive a model for the electron - phonon interaction between a single siv@xmath1 center and lattice vibrations in a finite sized crystalline structure .",
    "first , we consider a diamond lattice composed of @xmath26 atoms including the siv@xmath1 center at the origin .",
    "atoms are arranged so that the whole structure maintains the @xmath2 symmetry of the point defect .",
    "we introduce the normal coordinates that describe lattice vibrations @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the mass of the @xmath29-th ion and @xmath30 is the displacement of the @xmath29-th ion in the @xmath31 direction ( @xmath32 or @xmath33 ) . in this notation , @xmath34 is the ion displacement vector from its equilibrium position @xmath35 , and @xmath36 are eigenvectors that satisfy the following eigenvalue equation @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the dynamical matrix associated with the ion - ion potential interaction and @xmath39 are the frequency associated with the @xmath40-th lattice mode .",

    "we assume that the electron wavefunctions are non - zero only on the @xmath44 defect atoms , therefore it is sufficient to consider the inner sum on the defect atoms only . in the appendix",
    "a we show a full derivation of the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "next , we promote the normal coordinates and the corresponding momentum conjugate to operators as follows @xmath54 where the set of @xmath55 independent boson creation @xmath56 and annihilation @xmath57 operators obey the commutation relation @xmath58 = \\delta_{ll'}.\\ ] ] note that we only quantize vibrational modes , as translational and rotational modes leave invariant the electron - phonon interaction . finally , by expanding the electron - phonon interaction in the electronic basis @xmath59 the following electron - phonon hamiltonian is obtained @xmath60 where the electron - phonon coupling constants are given by @xmath61 to evaluate @xmath62 we used symmetrized gaussian orbitals ( see appendix c for details ) .",

    "the fluorescence spectrum of the emitted radiation in a thermal equilibrium state is determined by the spectral intensity radiated per unit solid angle by an oscillating dipole and it is given by @xcite @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the dipole vector and @xmath66 is the unitary vector pointing in the direction of @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , we calculate the emission spectrum associated to the electronic transition from the excited @xmath67 to ground state @xmath68 as the fourier transform of the current - current correlation function at thermal equilibrium by applying the kubo formula @xcite @xmath69 where @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath74 , known as the spin - boson hamiltonian @xcite , is given by @xmath75 where the first , second and third term are the hamiltonians of the electronic states of the point defect ( eq . ) , the electron - phonon interaction to first order in the ion displacements ( eq . ) , and the phonon bath , respectively .",
    "the average @xmath76 is taken over phonons , which are assumed to be in thermal equilibrium . the electron - phonon interaction in eq .",
    "describes acoustic , optical and quasi - local phonon modes coupled to the electronic states of the point defect .",
    "physically , during the emission or absorption processes , the electronic charge changes its spatial distribution leading to a change in the potential seen by the ions close to the charge localization .",
    "ions will seek for new equilibrium positions , resulting in a relaxation process inducing lattice vibrations . in order to determine how the phonon relaxation processes affect the optical properties we introduce the polaron transformation @xcite given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 in the density operator formalism",

    "therefore , the expectation value can be calculated as @xmath85 under these approximations the emission spectrum can be analytically calculated as @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the bare electronic frequency transition , @xmath88 is the polaron shift and @xmath89 contains the effect of phonons on the optical line shape and is given by    \\(t ) & = _",

    "if the electronic states interact with the same strength to phonons , both coupling constants for the ground and excited states are similar and the spectral density function is small leading to a transition involving few phonons and resulting in a fluorescent shape that closely resembles that of a phonon - free system . on the contrary , if these two couplings are substantially different , the change on electronic distribution , and therefore , on the potential seen by the ions is large and the emission spectrum is greatly modified ( figure  [ fig : configurationaldiagram ] ) .",

    "the electron - phonon coupling constants depend crucially on the atomic configuration , the symmetry of the point defect and the symmetry of the host material . as an example , the fluorescent of the nitrogen - vacancy center ( nv - center ) and siv@xmath0 center in diamond are very different from each other although they differ in one atom in their molecular composition .",
    "the nv - center has a broad emission ranging from 637 nm zero - phonon line ( zpl ) to 750 nm , meanwhile the emission of the siv@xmath0 has a width of few nanometers at the same temperature @xcite .",
    "the symmetry of the point defect is determined by the atomic configuration @xcite . in the case of the nv - center",
    ", the nitrogen atom is substitutional and its atomic configuration does not remain the same under inversion , i.e. , parity is not a good description for wavefunctions and vibrations @xcite . on the contrary , in the siv@xmath0",
    ", the silicon atom is interstitial between two vacancies and its configuration remains the same under inversion @xcite , i.e. , electronic wavefunctions and vibrations can be described by parity . as the coupling constants @xmath91 are the integration of three functions , its expectation value will be zero if the total product is odd .",
    "the lack of inversion symmetry in the nv - center allows in principle the contribution from all vibrational modes . whereas the coupling constants @xmath95 and @xmath96 for the siv@xmath0 can be very similar due to inversion symmetry",
    "indeed , in the siv@xmath0 the ground state is a gerade ( even ) linear combination of dangling bond atomic orbitals meanwhile the excited state is an ungerade ( odd ) function of these orbitals .",
    "these wavefunctions might differ only by a phase leading to a very similar electronic distribution , a small change upon electronic transitions in the trapping potential seen by the ions , and therefore a very small phonon contribution to the spectral density function @xmath97 .",

    "the vibrational modes are calculated using a force - constant model to second order nearest - neighbor interaction @xcite in order to better resemble the real phonon dispersion relation of diamond @xcite ( see figure  [ fig : phononrelationdispersiondiamond ] ) .",

    "this peak also contains contributions from @xmath100 phonon modes which contribute to the width of the peak .",
    "so far the motion of the silicon atom does not play a role if we consider phonon modes with even symmetry .",
    "however , recently an isotopic shift of the phonon sideband was observed for different silicon isotopes @xcite : as the mass of the silicon atom increases , the distance between the zpl and the phonon sideband decreases suggesting that a local vibrational mode primarily composed of the silicon atom is involved .",
    "such mode is necessarily of character @xmath103 ( odd ) , and for symmetry reasons it should not contribute to the coupling constants @xmath95 and @xmath96 if the electronic states given in eqs.- are used .",
