    "black holes play an important rle in modern physics . for many years",
    ", they were considered merely a mathematical curiosity arising from einstein s field equations . in more recent decades",
    "there has emerged strong evidence for their presence in binary systems and galactic centers . aside from the growing observational data , it is clear that the _ idea _ of a black hole has its own attractive power .",
    "black holes have captured the imagination of a generation of physicists .",
    "for example , debates on black hole thermodynamics  @xcite and the information paradox  @xcite are ongoing .",
    "the detection of gravitational waves from black hole binaries is hoped to be imminent  @xcite .",
    "the possibility of black hole creation at the lhc  @xcite has recently received hyperbolic media attention .    naturally , the possibility that _ black hole analogues _  @xcite may be created in the laboratory has attracted widespread interest .",
    "analogues are artificial systems with some of the key properties of black holes . in 1981 , unruh  @xcite proposed the idea of a _ dumb hole _ : a region of fluid from which no sound may escape . a dumb hole , or _ acoustic hole _",
    "@xcite , is bounded by an apparent horizon : a surface through which the normal flow velocity is equal to the speed of sound in the fluid . in this paper",
    ", we study the simplest spherically - symmetric dumb hole , the so - called _ canonical acoustic hole_. a range of alternative analogue systems have been proposed , for example in superfluid helium  @xcite , in bose - einstein condensates  @xcite , in electromagnetic waveguides  @xcite , in optical fibers  @xcite and other systems  @xcite .    under certain assumptions ( an inviscid , barotropic fluid ; irrotational flow )",
    ", the navier - stokes equations describing small perturbations to fluid flow turn out to be formally identical to the equations for a massless scalar field propagating in a ( 3 + 1 ) lorentzian geometry .",
    "that is  @xcite , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a small perturbation to the potential describing the fluid velocity , @xmath3 .",
    "the effective metric @xmath4 is an algebraic function of the background flow @xmath5 , the local density @xmath6 , and the speed of sound @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the fluid pressure .",
    "the appropriate metric for the canonical acoustic hole is given in section  [ sec - canonical ] .",
    "acoustic black holes are expected to emit a thermal spectrum of phonons , since hawking s original arguments follow through without essential modification  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the laws of black hole thermodynamics do not follow .",
    "it seems that the association of entropy with horizon area is a special property of the einstein equations  @xcite .",
    "the hawking temperature for the canonical acoustic hole , @xmath9  @xcite , is sufficiently small that direct detection of hawking radiation has not been achieved .",
    "the possibility of detecting hawking emission from a 1d bose - einstein analogue is under investigation @xcite .",
    "there is more to acoustic holes than just hawking radiation , however .",
    "as has been pointed out  @xcite , there is a range of interesting classical wave phenomena which should be amenable to experiment .",
    "in particular , the scattering of perturbations by acoustic holes has been studied by a number of authors , in both the frequency domain  @xcite and the time domain  @xcite . like black holes , acoustic holes have characteristic damped resonances called quasi - normal modes .",
    "these resonances appear in the dynamic response of acoustic holes to external perturbation .",
    "time - dependent scattering has been considered in detail for the lowest multipoles @xmath10 . however , a study of the overall scattering pattern produced by the superposition of many angular modes has not been considered .",
    "this is the main purpose of our paper .    in this study , we adopt the partial wave approach to investigate the scattering and absorption of a monochromatic external perturbation impinging upon a canonical acoustic hole .",
    "we compare our results with previous studies of time - independent scattering by astrophysical holes  @xcite . in this regard , we are motivated by the exciting prospects for gravitational wave astronomy  @xcite .",
    "it is possible that acoustic scattering experiments may offer a way to better understand the dynamics of gravitational radiation .",
    "further studies of wave propagation in analogue systems and their experimental realization are to be encouraged .",
