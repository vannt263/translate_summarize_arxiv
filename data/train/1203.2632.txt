    "there is a consensus that nonzero masses of neutrinos and the nontrivial mixing between them is the plausible framework to explain the outstanding results of plenty of neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "the standard approach is to have a three active neutrino scenario , with at least two nonzero masses and two reasonably large mixing angles  @xcite .",
    "an interesting extension to this standard scenario is the existence of extra light sterile neutrino states which arose for the first time in the light of lsnd experiment  @xcite showing evidence for @xmath3 oscillation ( see also the recent miniboone data  @xcite that seems to corroborate ) .",
    "another evidence of the presence of light sterile neutrinos is the so - called reactor neutrino anomaly  @xcite .",
    "this anomaly is the departure from unity of the ratio of observed rate of events to the predicted rate in very short - baseline reactor neutrino experiments .",
    "this departure prompted by the re - evaluation of @xmath4 reactor flux that revealed 2.5 % increase in the flux  @xcite .",
    "also the gallium anomaly  @xcite show a deficit of @xmath5 produced by intense radioactive sources , such that the ratio of observed rate to the predicted rate is @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "all these anomalies can be understood by adding one ( or more ) light sterile neutrino states to the scenario with three active neutrinos , with active - sterile mass - squared difference @xmath7 .",
    "the 3 + 1 scenario  @xcite is the simplest scenario to accommodate the presence of light sterile neutrinos .",
    "the model is composed of 4 flavor states @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , that are the mixture of mass eigenstates @xmath11 with masses @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "we associate the mass scale that induce the very short - baseline oscillations , @xmath14 , with the mass difference @xmath15 .",
    "it should be noticed that in order to explain the reactor anomaly , a nonzero component of @xmath16 in the state @xmath5 is necessary .    a new generation of tritium beta decay experiments , like the karlsruhe tritium neutrino ( katrin ) experiment  @xcite , was proposed to search kinematically for the neutrino mass by measuring the energy spectrum of the electrons from the beta decay of tritium @xmath17h@xmath18he@xmath19 ( see also other proposals  @xcite ) . a nonzero neutrino mass results in displacement of the endpoint energy in electron spectrum which is the focus region to probe in katrin .",
    "in this letter we analyze the capability of katrin experiment in the search for endpoint displacement in the energy spectrum of @xmath0-electrons due to the lightest neutrino mass @xmath20 and the irregularities in the shape of energy spectrum due to the heavier ( mostly sterile ) neutrino mass @xmath21 and its nonzero mixing with electron neutrino .",
    "we discuss for the first time the role of the lightest neutrino mass @xmath20 in determination of the sensitivity of katrin experiment to the oscillation parameter @xmath22 .",
    "we show that with the present katrin design , this experiment is the only one sensitive to the part of parameter space corresponding to very small active - sterile mixing angle and large active - sterile mass - squared difference .",
    "the katrin experiment  @xcite have the following setup . injected molecular tritium gas at tritium laboratory karlsruhe provides high luminosity @xmath0-electrons emitting isotropically .",
    "the electrons will be guided by the gradient of a magnetic field to the so - called mac - e - filter ( magnetic adiabatic collimation combined with an electrostatic filter ) spectrometer .",
    "the ratio of the minimum magnetic field at the central plane of the spectrometer ( @xmath23  t ) to the maximum magnetic field near the tritium source ( @xmath24  t ) determines the relative sharpness of the energy filtering of mac - e - filter . also applying a magnetic field",
    "@xmath25  t at the tritium source suppresses the entrance of electrons with large initial emission angle . in the spectrometer , with the help of an electric field parallel to the electron s propagation path , it is possible to make an electrostatic barrier @xmath26 which can be passed just by electrons with energy higher than the height of the barrier . taking all together , the transmission function of the katrin spectrometer as a function of electron kinetic energy @xmath27 and retarding potential @xmath26 is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the relative sharpness of the filter .",
    "however , electrons can undergo inelastic scattering with tritium molecules in the source which can change the spectrum . taking into account the probability of multiple inelastic scattering",
    ", the transmission function modifies to the following convoluted form @xmath30 { \\rm d}\\epsilon , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the probability that the electron scatters @xmath32 times off the tritium molecules before leaving the source and @xmath33 is the energy loss function at each scattering  @xcite .",

    ". however , in the case of sterile neutrino with a mass - squared difference @xmath54 , this approximation fails and the error of using effective mass in the fit of spectrum becomes large .",

    "in this work we analyzed the sensitivity of beta decay experiment katrin in determining the mass scale associated with the presence of a light sterile neutrino state . motivation comes from the @xmath104 reactor anomaly , the gallium anomaly , the lsnd and miniboone experiments which favor the presence of light sterile neutrinos that mix with electron neutrinos , compatible with @xmath7 and small mixing angles @xmath105 .    for the first time we considered the effect of light mass scale @xmath20 in the determination of oscillation parameter @xmath22 in katrin .",
