    "in recent years there has been a growing interest for semiconductor devices characterized by tunneling effects between different bands , as the resonant interband tunneling diode ( ritd ) @xcite .",
    "this kind of diode belongs to the class of heterostructures that show a negative differential resistance in a certain range of the applied voltage , like the widely employed rtd ( resonant tunneling diode ) @xcite",
    ". however , differently from the latter where the electronic current flows within a single band , the remarkable feature of a ritd is the possibility to achieve a sharp coupling between  conduction \" and  valence \" states , allowing an interband current which becomes the main transport phenomena in the resonant region .",
    "the description of electron transport in such quantum devices hence requires multiband models capable to account for tunneling mechanisms between different bands induced by the heterostructure design and the applied external bias .    in the literature ,",
    "different methods are currently employed for characterizing the band structures and the electronic or optical properties of these heterostructures , such as envelope functions methods based on the effective mass theory @xcite , tight - binding @xcite and pseudopotential @xcite methods .",
    "in addition , various mathematical tools are employed to exploit the multiband quantum dynamics underlying the previous models : the schrdinger - like models @xcite , the nonequilibrium green s function @xcite , the wigner function approach @xcite , and recently the hydrodynamics multiband formalisms @xcite .",
    "all of these methods rely on some common approximations to account for the effects of a non - uniform band profile on the electron dynamics . in particular , in the usual `` @xmath1 '' approach @xcite",
    ", one starts by defining the hamiltonian matrix of the bulk ( in @xmath2-space ) , and then allows the physical parameters ( typically the band eigenvalues or the luttinger - kohn parameters @xcite ) to have some @xmath3-dependence in order to describe the position - dependent properties of the heterostructure . in this approach care",
    "must be taken to preserve the self - jointness of hamiltonian matrix , so appropriate quantization rules are needed @xcite . in this way",
    ", the electrical fields arising from the band edge offset among different layers are not included from the beginning in the derivation of the model , but appear only at the macroscopic level ( i.e. at the level of envelope functions ) .",
    "indeed , in the previous approximation technique , the @xmath4-dependence of the unperturbed hamiltonian matrix elements , generates a ",
    "mean effective electric field \" acting on the envelope functions , which is not present at the microscopic level .",
    "a different approach has been proposed in @xcite were a local  modified wannier basis \" is chosen to include the inhomogeneity directly into the basis elements .",
    "unfortunately , in this case the equations of motion of the envelope functions depend on the change of the bloch functions across the interfaces ( that are implicitly neglected in the previous procedure ) and such an evaluation can result in a very difficult task .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a different strategy , describing the band edge offsets by means of external potentials applied to the bulk structure .",
    "this allows us to treat on the same footing both the electrostatic potential generated by the charge distribution in the device and the heterostructure design of band edges , in order to highlight the role played by the heterostructure potential in the interband tunneling process .    within this framework",
    "we derive a hierarchy of multiband models obtained by means of a @xmath0-expansion , were the momentum @xmath0 plays the role of asymptotic parameter as in the usual `` @xmath5 '' approach .",
    "the starting point is the single electron bloch representation , that here we consider for simplicity for the case of non degenerate bands and constant band gaps .",
    "then , after the @xmath0-expansion , the electron wavefunction is projected on the wannier basis , yielding a set of coupled schrdinger equations for the electron envelope functions in definite energy bands .",
    "these equations share some similarities with those of the well known kane @xcite and luttinger - kohn ( lk ) @xcite models . however , a key difference is the choice of the basis elements . indeed , since in a uniform crystal the wannier functions of a given energy band are related to the bloch functions of the same band by a unitary transformation , this allows us to give a simple physical insight to the envelope functions . differently , since the kane model arises form a unitary transformation of only the periodic part of the bloch functions , the generic element of the kane basis is nondiagonal in the bloch band index @xmath6 , and envelope functions related to different  band \" indices turn out to be coupled even in absence of any applied potential , therefore lacking of a direct physical interpretation .",
    "the lk model instead is a multiband effective mass model obtained from the latter by an additional quasi - unitary transformation that removes the spurious interband coupling to first order in @xmath0 .",
    "however , since the lk approach is devoted to describe intraband effects , the coupling due to the external field is generally neglected .    as an application of the present approach we consider the case of a two - band ritd , showing that the model is able to reproduce the expected behaviour of the current as a function of the applied voltage .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss the derivation of the model and the approximations employed ; then in sec .",
    "[ sec : comparison ] we analyze differences and analogies with the kane @xcite and luttinger - kohn @xcite models . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : example ] we work out explicitly the case of a ritd , investigating its current - voltage characteristic curve .",
    "let us consider an electron of mass @xmath7 immersed in a crystal lattice described by the periodic potential @xmath8 , in the presence of an additional external potential @xmath9 that will be treated as a perturbation .",

    "( [ eq : coeff2 ] ) can be formally written in coordinate space as @xmath51 this equation is equivalent to the generalized form of the wannier equations of ref .",
    "@xcite , with the advantage of having the interband term written in a more transparent form in terms of its fourier components .",
    "this expression allows for a simple manipulation of the above equation , that for practical use , has to be further simplified .",
    "the simplest approach is to adopt the following standard approximations @xcite , assuming that    * the energy spectrum is of simple form with minima / maxima of each band at some point @xmath52 in the first brillouin zone ; * the @xmath53 functions are localized on a small region of @xmath54 space around @xmath52 during the whole evolution of the system .    for convenience in the notations , and without loss of generality , in the rest of the paper we will set @xmath55 .",

    "this is due to the fact that the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath77 is not diagonal on the kane basis ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : matrix_el_ka ] ) ) , and therefore the @xmath6 here does not correspond to the usual band index of the bloch picture .",

    "this term would come from the expansion of the off - diagonal kernel @xmath85 but is cancelled exactly by a term coming from the expansion of the @xmath18 functions to second order in @xmath0 . as a matter of fact , this contribution is absent in our approach since only the off - diagonal terms that depend on the external potential @xmath9 have been approximated ( up to @xmath86 in eq .",

    "these results demonstrate that the present model is promising for reproducing the i - v curves of physical devices as that considered e.g. in @xcite , although a precise comparison requires the extension to structures with varying band gap profiles ( or , more generally , with @xmath97-dependent luttinger - kohn parameters @xcite ) and will be considered in a future publication .",
