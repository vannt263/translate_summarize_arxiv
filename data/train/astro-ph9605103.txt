    "motivated by observations that we may live in a low density universe @xcite , several authors have considered a possible scenario which realizes an open universe @xmath2 in the context of inflationary cosmology @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the standard inflation models which predict a spatially flat universe @xmath3 , this scenario predicts an universe with spatially negative curvature . in this scenario ,",
    "the nucleation of a vacuum bubble plays an essential role . in general , the bubble nucleation process is described by the bounce solution with o(4)-symmetry , which is a non - trivial classical solution of the field equation in euclidean spacetime@xcite .",
    "then the expanding bubble after nucleation is described by the classical solution obtained by analytic continuation of the bounce solution to lorentzian spacetime .",
    "owing to the o(4)-symmetry of the bounce solution , the expanding bubble has the o(3,1)-symmetry .",
    "this implies that the system is homogeneous and isotropic on the hyperbolic time slicing inside the bubble and that the creation of one bubble can be regarded as the creation of an open universe .    to obtain a realistic model of an open universe , the flatness @xmath4 and the homogeneity and isotropy of the universe",
    "should be realized inside the bubble .",
    "this requirement can be satisfied by assuming , for example , a scalar field with a potential such as in the new inflation scenario but with a high potential barrier before the slow rolling inflationary phase@xcite .",
    "in addition , the high potential barrier keeps the bubble collision rate small , hence the homogeneity and isotropy of the one - bubble universe is not disturbed by the other nucleated bubbles .",
    "then the second inflation inside the bubble inflates the universe and explains the flatness @xmath4 .",
    "linde and mezhlumian has proposed another ( perhaps more natural ) model of open inflation by introducing two scalar fields@xcite , but the essential feature of scenario is the same as the former .",
    "the interesting problem is the origin of fluctuations in this open inflationary scenario . following the usual picture that quantum fluctuations of the scalar field generate the initial density perturbations",
    ", we need to investigate the quantum state of the scalar field after bubble nucleation . according to previous investigations ,",
    "the open inflation scenario shows interesting varieties of the fluctuations .",
    "the bubble nucleation process can excite fluctuations of the scalar field and may increase the power of density fluctuations on scale of spatial curvature @xcite .",
    "also it has been shown that peculiar discrete modes of fluctuations on super - curvature scale may exist @xcite and contribute to cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies in an open universe @xcite .",
    "very recently , generation of another type of super - curvature perturbations which originate from the bubble wall perturbations has been discussed @xcite .    in this paper , we develop a method to calculate these varieties of fluctuations in the open inflationary universe and evaluate the power spectrum of the resulting cmb anisotropies . in order to perform a detailed analysis of the power specturm ,",
    "it is necessary to specify the model to some extent .",
    "here we consider two classes of models .",
    "one is a single scalar field model ( model a ) proposed by bucher , goldhaber and turok@xcite and by ourselves@xcite .",
    "the other is a two - field model ( model b ) in which the false vacuum decay and inflation inside the bubble are governed by two different scalar fields , such as the supernatural inflation proposed by linde and mezhlumian@xcite . for simplicity , we assume the difference in the vacuum energy density between inside and outside the bubble is negligible in both models . our method is based on the formalism we developed previously for computing the mode functions during and after bubble nucleation @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe our method to calculate quantum fluctuations of the inflaton field .",
    "we assume that the reaction to the geometry can be neglected , i.e. , the nucleation occurs in the de sitter spacetime background .",
    "then , in section 3 , we investigate the evolution of fluctuations inside the bubble in an open inflationary stage and derive the formulas to calculate the initial perturbation spectrum of the open universe and the resulting cmb anisotropies . in section 4",
    "we evaluate the cmb anisotropies in two simple models and examine their viability .",
    "section 5 is devoted to conclusion .",
    "we adopts the units @xmath5 , and the bar denotes the complex conjugate .",
    "in this section , we describe our formalism to investigate quantum field fluctuations inside a bubble .",
    "pioneering work on the quantum state of a nucleating bubble was done by rubakov @xcite , kandrup @xcite , vachaspati and vilenkin @xcite .",
    "recently , we have developed a formalism to investigate the quantum state of a scalar field after false vacuum decay based on the wkb wave function of a multi - dimensional tunneling system @xcite .",
    "the formalism has been applied to the bubble nucleation which occurs on the minkowski background , and the spectrum of field fluctuations after the decay has been studied @xcite .",
    "the basic formalism has been extended to the case in which the bubble nucleation occurs on the de sitter spacetime@xcite . there",
    "the effect of the non - trivial geometry of the instanton with gravity , i.e. , the coleman - de luccia instanton@xcite was taken into account . at that time , however , the appropriate set of the mode functions to describe the initial vacuum state , which is expected to be the bunch - davies vacuum due to the sufficient inflation before the tunneling , had not been known .",
    "thus there was a technical difficulty in applying our formalism .",
    "recently , we have succeeded in describing the bunch - davies vacuum state in the spatially open chart@xcite .",
    "thus this problem has been overcome .",
    "combining the results in these two papers@xcite , we now have a tool to hundle the quantum fluctuations after tunneling which includes the effect of the geometry of the coleman - de luccia instanton similar to the case in the minkowski background@xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we consider simple open inflation models in which the geometry of the coleman - de luccia instanton can be approximated by the pure de sitter spacetime .",
    "that is we consider the case in which the potential energy difference between the two vacua of the tunneling filed is small .",
    "we consider the action @xmath6 where the potential @xmath7 is assumed to have the form as shown in figs .",
    "1(a ) , ( b ) to realize the false vacuum decay . as we mentioned above , we take account of the effect of gravity only as a curved background which is assumed to be de sitter space .",
    "we denote the value of @xmath8 at the false vacuum by @xmath9 .",
    "the field @xmath10 is the inflaton in the nucleated bubble .",
    "we devide them into two parts as @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 is the seimi - classical , spatially homogeneous part of the field and @xmath13 represents the quantum fluctuations around this background .",
    "we neglect the quantum fluctuations of @xmath8 and denote its @xmath14-symmetric background by @xmath15 . due to the @xmath14-symmetry of the instanton",
    ", @xmath15 is a function of only one coordinate , say @xmath16 . in addition",
    ", we assume @xmath12 also respects the @xmath14-symmetry .",
    "thus a model we have in mind is a two - field one , with @xmath12 being constant at @xmath17 .",
    "note that we can consider a single field model by identifying @xmath13 with the quantum fluctuations of @xmath8 and letting @xmath18 .    with these assumptions ,",
    "the action for @xmath13 reduces to @xmath19 where @xmath20 as noted above , in the case of a single field model , @xmath12 and @xmath21 in the following discussion should be replaced by @xmath15 and @xmath22 respectively .",
    "our formalism is summarized in the following .",
    "it is based on the wkb wave function which describes the tunneling decay in a multi - dimensional system @xcite .",
    "the construction of the wave function was originally developed by gervais and sakita @xcite .",
    "the wave functional is written in terms of the bounce solution @xmath15 , which gives the semi - classical picture of the nucleation and expanding bubble , and a set of mode functions which describe the quantum fluctuations @xmath13 on the bounce solution@xcite .",
    "the boundary condition for these mode functions is determined from the fact that the wave function describes the false vacuum state at @xmath17 .",
    "it then turned out that the procedure to obtain the appropriate set of mode functions is equivalent to finding out a complete set of them which are regular in one hemisphere of the euclideanized de sitter space@xcite .",
    "that is , to find a complete set of mode functions @xmath23 which obey @xmath24 v_{\\bf k}(t,{\\bf x})=0,\\ ] ] in the lorentzian region , and which are regular on the @xmath25 hemisphere . here , it is important to note that `` a complete set '' means a set of all modes which are properly normalized by the klein - gordon norms on a cauchy surface @xmath26 of spacetime , @xmath27 once they are obtained , the quantum fluctuations of the field are described by the  vacuum state \" , @xmath28 , such that @xmath29 for any @xmath30 where the fluctuating field is expressed as @xmath31 in the heisenberg representation , with @xmath32 and @xmath33 being the annihilation and creation operators , respectively .",
    "thus the mode functions @xmath23 play the role of the positive frequency functions .    to write down the equation for the mode functions , we introduce the coordinates in the de sitter spacetime following ref.@xcite .",

    "the coordinate systems in the lorentzian de sitter space are obtained by analytic continuation as @xmath39 we find that each set of these coordinates covers three distinct parts of the lorentzian de sitter spacetime , which we call the regions @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "the metrics in these three regions are given by @xmath43 respectively , where @xmath44 .",
    "we assign the region l to be in the false vacuum sea and the region r to describe the open universe inside the bubble .",

    "is attached so that the functions @xmath58 become properly normalized harmonics on the hyperbolic slices in the region r or l : @xmath59    as we have noted before , a complete set of mode functions should be properly normalized on a cauchy surface .",
    "therefore we consider the mode functions in the region c , since it is the region in which complete cauchy surfaces exist .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath51 play the role of the positive frequency functions there .",
    "then the remaining tasks are ( 1 ) to find the possible spectrum of @xmath60 that may give finite klein - gordon norms and ( 2 ) to properly normalize the mode functions if they are normalizable .",
    "to accomplish the first task , we now consider the equation for @xmath50 , ( [ eqchi ] ) . in the region",
    "c , the equation for @xmath50 remains the same because @xmath61 . introducing the conformal coordinate @xmath62 by the relation @xmath63 , the metric in the region c becomes @xmath64 where @xmath65 and eq .",

    "thus finding possible values of @xmath60 is equivalent to solving the eigenvalue problem of the above equation . since @xmath70 at @xmath71 , the spectrum of modes is continuous for @xmath72 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath73 for some interval of @xmath62 , the potential has a valley and some discrete modes which correspond to bound states may appear for @xmath74 .",

    "as long as the volume with @xmath77 is large enough , an analogous mode is expected to exist in general .",
    "let us call it the de sitter super - curvature mode . for @xmath78 . as @xmath79 corresponds to the scale of spatial curvature , fluctuations described by the harmonics with @xmath78 represents those which decay exponentially on scales larger than the curvature scale .",

    "we will discuss this aspect of the quantum fluctuations in the next section .",
    "once we have the mode functions which describe the quantum state of the inflaton field inside the bubble , we can investigate the evolution of resulting cosmological perturbations in the open inflationary stage and the subsequent stage of the open friedmann universe , which can be compared with observational data . in this section ,",
    "we first consider the initial condition of the cosmological perturbations generated during the open inflationary stage , based on the results obtained in the previous section . since the inflaton is almost massless during the open inflationary stage inside the bubble",
    ", we set @xmath165 . then we relate it to the spectrum of large angular scale cmb anisotropies .",

    "just after the bubble is formed , or in the spacetime region close to the boundary light cone of the region r , the universe is dominated by the curvature term , or the matter energy density can be neglected .",
    "hence the metric perturbations induced by the quantum fluctuations of the scalar field are negligible . on the other hand ,",
    "there exists a time slicing on which the effect of metric perturbations is minimal , called the flat hypersurfaces .",
    "this implies that the fluctuations described by the mode functions we have obtained in the previous section may be regarded as those on the flat hypersurfaces .",
    "it is easy to show that the curvature perturbation on the comoving hypersurface @xmath173 is related to the scalar field perturbation @xmath13 on the flat hypersurface as @xmath174 @xcite .",
    "assuming the perturbation is adiabatic , @xmath173 completely determines the metric and matter perturbations of scalar type ( i.e. , those which can be expanded in terms of scalar harmonics on the 3-space ) .",
    "an important property of @xmath173 is that it remains constant on superhorizon scales as long as the perturbation is adiabatic , irrespective of the background spatial curvature of the universe ( see appendix a ) .",

    "in particular , the spectrum of cmb anisotropies rises sharply towards lower multipoles for open models with @xmath266 . hence if this mode dominates over the other mode contributions ,",
    "such single field models will be severely excluded by the cobe data@xcite .",
    "this issue has been recently investigated by garriga @xcite and garcia - bellido@xcite .",

    "thus if the potential barrier is high enough , approximately of @xmath290 , the wall fluctuation mode will become harmless .",
    "apart from the intrinsic unnaturalness of a single field model , it is not difficult to construct models which satisfy the above constraint .",
    "hence we conclude that a single field model remains still viable .",

    "we assume that the gradient of the potential is so small that we can neglect its effect in estimating the amplitude of the fluctuations @xmath13 , though the condition under which this neglection is justified is not clear",

    "we denote the radius of bubble wall by @xmath294 .",

    "these make it difficult to form a bound state .",
    "we note that @xmath68 has the deepest valley when the mass @xmath123 is zero .",
    "this situation corresponds to the case when we assume the bunch - davies vacuum state inside the bubble and when the super - curvature mode contributes extremely @xcite .",
    "now we show the results of numerical calculations of the cmb anisotropy power spectrum @xmath328 in fig .  9 for the @xmath329 universe with @xmath330 and the wall radii @xmath331 , @xmath302 , @xmath303 , and @xmath304 .",
    "the curves are normalized by @xmath332 . here both continuous and discrete modes are included . to compare the results with the previous ones @xcite , we plotted two dashed lines in the figure .",
    "the top dashed curve is the result when the scalar field is in the bunch - davies vacuum @xcite , and the bottom dashed curve is the one in the conformal vacuum@xcite .",
    "all of the curves lie between these two curves .",
    "we see the amplitude becomes large as the wall radius increases , approaching that in the case of the bunch - davies vacuum . as described before , the contribution of the super - curvature mode is most for the bunch - davies vacuum and is least for the conformal vacuum .",
    "when the wall radius becomes large and the mass becomes small , the contribution from the super - curvature mode becomes large , which explains the behavior of the cmb power spectra in fig  .9 .",
    "we have also calculated the cmb spectra for the @xmath333 universe .",
    "the results have turned out to be almost independent of the model parameters .",
    "in fact , if only @xmath334 is taken into account , the difference between the bunch - davies vacuum and the conformal vacuum is only a few percent even for @xmath329 @xcite .",
    "thus the differences are dominantly due to the de sitter super - curvature mode @xmath335 , but its contribution rapidly becomes negligible as one increases @xmath253 .",
    "we have investigated in detail the quantum fluctuations and the resultant cmb anisotropies in two simple models of one - bubble open inflationary scenario . before going into the analysis of the specific models , we have extended the previously developed formalism to investigate the quantum state inside the nucleated bubble , and derived formulas for the mode functions which take account of the effect of the tunneling described by the coleman - de luccia instanton . in the main stream , we have assumed the potential energy difference between the false and true vacua is small enough so that spacetime both inside and outside the bubble can be described by de sitter space with a single hubble parameter @xmath172 , but the results can be easily extended to more general cases .",
    "a complete description of a quantum state requires a complete set of mode functions which are normalizable on a cauchy surface of the whole spacetime .",
    "this brings about new sets of fluctuation modes which had not been considered in most of the previous analyses of an open inflationary universe .",
    "in addition to the usual modes with continuous spectrum , there are modes with discrete spectrum corresponding to the fluctuations on super - curvature scales . for both the continuous and discrete modes ,",
    "we have obtained general formulas of the spectrum of the cmb anisotropies on large angular scales which result from the quantum fluctuations .    after these preparations , we have considered two simple classes of one - bubble open inflationary models .",
    "one is a single field model with the potential as illustrated in fig .",
    "1(a ) , assuming that the mass square in the false vacuum , @xmath267 , is much larger than @xmath336 .",
    "the other is a two - field model in which the false vacuum decay is mediated by a scalar field different from the inflaton inside the bubble and the inflaton is massive in the false vacuum through the coupling with the tunneling field .    in the case of a single field model with @xmath240",
    ", there is one discrete mode which represents fluctuations of the bubble wall .",
    "we have shown that there is no other discrete mode in this model .",
    "thus we have considered the cmb anisotropies due to the continous modes and the wall fluctuation mode .",
    "as far as the contribution of the continuous modes to the cmb anisotropies is concerned , we have found that it is approximately the same as in the case of the bunch - davies vacuum or the conformal vacuum .",
    "hence we have focused on the wall fluctuation mode .",
    "the curvature perturbation due to the wall fluctuation mode is notable .",
    "it is always present in this model and its amplitude is totally determined by the part of the potential which governs the tunneling but has nothing to do with the scalar field dynamics inside the nucleated bubble . since its amplitude is independent of the amplitude of the curvature perturbation due to the continuous modes , its contribution to the cmb anisotropies gives rise to an independent constraint on the model , just as the gravitational wave perturbation does to the usual inflation models .",
    "fortunately , the constraint turns out to be relatively weak .",
    "thus it is possible to construct a model in which the effect of the wall fluctuation mode can be neglected .",
    "here we make the following remark .",
    "the wall fluctuation mode has a peculiar property that curvature perturbations induced by it are transverse - traceless , hence it can be regarded as a mode of tensor - type perturbations .",
    "this means that the perturbation of the scalar field might couple with the gravitational wave perturbation for this mode when the degrees of freedom of gravity are fully taken into accout .",
    "but we have not incoorpolated them in the present analysis .",
    "thus there remains a possibility that the final answer changes qualitatively .",
    "we hope to come back to this issue in near future .    as for a two - field model",
    ", we have adopted the thin - wall approximation and assumed the mass of the inflaton changes like the step function across the wall .",
    "thus the model can be parametrized by the mass in the false vacuum @xmath123 , the hubble radius @xmath172 and the wall radius @xmath40 . in this model",
    ", the origin of the discrete mode is different from that in the single field model .",
    "since it originates from the spacetime structure of de sitter space , we have called it the de sitter super - curvature mode .",
    "the existence of the de sitter super - curvature mode depends on the mass @xmath123 of the inflaton at the false vacuum and on the radius @xmath40 of the bubble wall .",
    "it appears when @xmath322 is large and @xmath337 is small . for models with @xmath338 ,",
    "the super - curvature mode disappears .",
    "different from the wall fluctuation mode which appeared in the single field model , the amplitude of spatial curvature perturbations induced by this mode is determined by the scalar field dynamics at the open inflationary stage inside the bubble , as in the case of the continuous modes .",
    "we have then investigated the spectrum of cmb anisotropies on large angular scales in this model .",
    "though the spectra of the curvature perturbations due to the continuous modes have different shapes on the curvature scale for different model parameters , we have found the resulting cmb power spectra do not significantly depend on the parameters for @xmath339 . on the other hand",
    ", the parameter - dependence appears clearly in the contribution of the de sitter super - curvature mode to the cmb spectrum .",
    "the effect of this mode is appreciable when the wall radius is large ( @xmath340 ) and the mass is small ( @xmath341 ) .",
    "the effect is to raise the amplitudes of low multipoles at @xmath342 for models with @xmath343 .",
    "if this mode contributes significantly , the predicted cmb power spectra will contradict with cobe observations @xcite .",
    "however , for an open universe of @xmath344 as well as for models with small @xmath322 and large @xmath337 , the effect of the super - curvature mode on the cmb anisotropies is practically negligible .",
    "we comment on implications of our results to the large scale structure formation .",
    "as all our open models predict the harrison - zeldovich spectrum on small scales , the difference can appear only from the normalization of the density perturbations .",
    "however , the difference will be negligible if we adopt the normalization scheme in terms of the likelihood analysis using the cobe result@xcite .",
    "this is because all the models predict practically the same cmb power spectrum at @xmath345 .    in summary ,",
    "we have presented a detailed analysis of the quantum fluctuations in open universe in simple models of the one - bubble inflationary scenario and the resulting cmb anisotropies on large angular scales .",
    "we have found there exist ranges of model parameters which are consistent with cmb observations . thus the one - bubble inflationary scenario is a viable one for explaining the large scale structure of the universe and it certainly deserves further study .",
    "there are of course many issues left to be clarified in future . for example , consideration of the continuous gravitational wave modes is definitely necessary .",
    "analyses of more sophisticated models , like several other two - field models proposed by linde and mezhlumian@xcite are of particular interest .",
    "inclusion of the degrees of freedom of the gravitational perturbation in the formalism from the beginning is a difficult issue but should be done in order to gain a more firm picture of the false vacuum decay and the subsequent evolution of the quantum state .",

    "thus we find that @xmath456 .",
    "using the above inequality , the denominator in @xmath453 is evaluated for @xmath444 as @xmath457 and is of order unity .",
    "now we show that no other discrete mode exists .",
    "suppose there existed another discrete mode .",
    "the next largest eigenvalue solution must have one node .",
    "noting the constraints @xmath458 and @xmath459 , we can easily see that there would be no node in ( iv ) . thus the solution must have a node in ( ii ) or ( iii ) .",
    "as we decrease @xmath119 from 2 , because @xmath460 must vanish at @xmath442 just before a node would first appear in ( iii ) , @xmath453 would diverge for some value of @xmath119 .",
    "however , the changes of @xmath351 and @xmath461 due to the variation of @xmath119 would be at most of @xmath462 and @xmath463 , respectively , and accordingly the change of @xmath464 would be also small . hence there is no chance that the denominator in @xmath453 would vanish , which is a contradiction .",
