    "inspired by the courage of borghesi @xcite on made predictions on some behaviors in 2009 elections in france based in past regularities , i present my owns for the july 2012 mexican election .",
    "unfortunately , the number of datasets onto these predictions are sustained are much more smaller than the french case , but the government s independent institution who is in charge of election organization is relatively new .",
    "additionally , the predictions presented here are made on the previous electoral results program ( prep after its spanish acronym of _ programa de resultados electorales previos _ ) which have their present form departing in 2000 .",
    "on how the prep works and about its history see the official web page of ife @xcite    this systems offers the first electoral results as the information arrives to the headquarters of authorities .",
    "the electoral authorities are grouped in the instituto federal electoral , ife .",
    "the mexican elections are organized with polling stations distributed along the country and admits , by construction , around @xmath2 votes .",
    "the day of the election , the polling stations start at @xmath3 hrs and close at @xmath4 hrs except if there are voters remaining .",
    "the votes are counted by citizen elected and trained by the ife in the presence of the political parties representatives .",
    "several data are hand written by the president of the polling station , the highest authority at the cabin , in the cabin certificate .",
    "these data are : total number of received ballots at the beginning of the electoral process ( br ) , number of remaining ( not used ) ballots ( bs ) , number of voters ( v ) , number of deposited ballots per cabin ( bd ) and the number of votes received for each party / candidate , v@xmath5 .",
    "the certified is stamped outside the electoral package , which contain the physical votes .",
    "the president carries the electoral package to the collecting stations at the district head , named cedat , _ centros de acopio y transmisin de datos_. the data are captured and send to the ife s headquarters .    hence , according to the ife s we page@xcite : `` el prep no cuenta votos , sino que captura y publica la informacin asentada en las actas de escrutinio y cmputo por los ciudadanos que participan como funcionarios de casilla .",
    "( the prep does not count votes , but it captures and publishes the information seated in the certificates of scrutiny and calculation by the citizens who take part as civil servants of cabin ) '' . and , `` los resultados presentados por el prep son preliminares , tienen un carcter informativo y no son definitivos , por tanto no tienen efectos jurdicos .",
    "( the results presented by the prep are preliminary , have an informative character and are not definitive , therefore they do not have juridical effects.)''@xcite .",
    "the definite results are counted during the count by distict , which will start in july 4th .",
    "however , prep offers an opportunity to know and learn about the errors and the ways the democratic process is carried on . in july 2006 ,",
    "the avoided crossing between the two main candidates percentage of votes at prep s dataset caused the suspicion of a large fraud , mainly by electronic ways . in this sense",
    "it is of fundamental importance to understand it and to fulfill the expected reliability . on the process of july 2006",
    "see @xcite for a chronicle , and references @xcite about the controversial results.recently appeared a new book  @xcite .",
    "the bibliography is certainly incomplete but i focus mainly in peer reviewed works and sociphysics literature .",
    "notice that , for the present process , `` por primera ocasin , durante este proceso electoral federal , el ife pondr a disposicin de la ciudadana , a travs de internet , la imagen digital de las aec(actas de escrutinio y cmputo ) de las ms de 143 mil casillas .",
    "( for the first occasion , during this electoral federal process , the ife will put at the disposal of the citizenship , across internet , the digital image of the aec ( _ voting certificates _ ) of more than 143 thousand cabins)''@xcite .",
    "the origin of the author interest in electoral data was due to the suspicion of a mega fraud in july 2006 .",
    "but , soon , i discovered the increasing interest of physicist and mathematicians in the field .",
    "but there is a lot theoretical work , many of them summarized in the report of castellano @xcite , but not so much on real data . some of the references on actual data are @xcite . with",
    "the experience gained analyzing electoral data in mexico , some regularities appeared , and i hope that some of them are part of the mexican electoral system ( i accept that the predictions could be wrong ) .",
    "the main regularities appeared during the studies of mexican elections @xcite are presented in the next subsections .",
    "suspicion of a large fraud in july 2006 force us to analyze the self consistency data contained in the dataset provided by ife . in order to test the existence of anomalies in the presidential data we calculated the error of all the independent tests ( summarized in table [ tabla2 ] ) and to contrast them with the results of congressional elections of the same year and the presidential one in 2000  @xcite .",
    "the global behavior , characterized by a power law decay in the center and two asymmetric lobes at each side appears in _ all _ the cases , with small differences .",
    "this result is highly surprising since the presidential process was in complete suspicion of fraud , meanwhile the presidential process in 2000 was clear .",
    "hence i present the following prediction :    .[tabla2]table of errors considered for a self consistency test of the prep database in july 2000 and 2006 .",
    "the prediction will run on the same distribution of errors for all the obtainable data during july 2012 .",
    "we abbreviated ballots with b .. the variable @xmath6 stands for the number of votes obtained for each party / candidate .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     each distribution of error is builded up by calculating the error defined in [ tabla2 ] on each cabin and doing the histogram of the values obtained , i.e. , how many cabins have values of error equal to 0,1,2,@xmath7 .",
    "in other words , we are seen for appearance and missing of votes .",
    "notice that in the ideal case all the error distributions must be a dirac delta function , or no lack or excess of votes",
    ".    for the figures see @xcite at the arxiv .",
    "the prep data is published in real time and reproduced by several information services . in the dataset",
    "the time of arrival to the capture center is recorded , hence a graph of percentage of votes for each party against the time is possible , but it is much more easy to handle if we plot the percentage of processed certificates instead of time . in @xcite",
    "we found that the behaviour of pri ruled the general vote decay of the other political parties due to a change in the behaviour . beyond @xmath0 of processed certificates pri",
    "presents a revival , it changes its rate of grow .",
    "this behavior is present in all elections in 2006 ( figure 1 and 2 in reference @xcite ) and the presidential of 2000 ( figure 9 at the same work ) .",
    "it is a well known fact that pri receive a lot of votes in geographical regions with a high marginalization index(see for instance @xcite ) , such a regions could have a slow process of cabins to the capture centers , explaining why pri is a sprinter , i.e .",
    ", it have a better performance at the end of the journey . during all this",
    "years many of such marginal regions are governed by the pri , hence there is no reason to believe that the mechanism that gives the performance improvement had been missed .    with these arguments",
    "i propose the second prediction :      during our analysis of electoral data , the smoothness of the vote distribution for the pri was matter of special atention .",
    "this distribution is the histogram of the number of polling stations with certain amount of votes . for comparison with probability distribution the amount of votes",
    "is `` unfolded '' or `` deconvoluted '' by using the average of number of votes ( see reference @xcite for an explanation but this procedure is standard in data treatment of complex quantum systems ) .",
    "in @xcite i reported the smooth behavior of this party in federal elections 2000 , 2003 and 2006 using the definitive dataset of count by district .",
    "a fitting with a model , named daisy@xcite , of different ranks was tested with success .",
    "this model depends only on the rank , @xmath1 , as free parameter and is written for the nearest neighbour as : @xmath8.\\ ] ] with @xmath1 integer and @xmath9 the gamma function .",
    "however , the distribution of daisy models is a particular case of a more general distribution named gamma and characterized by two free parameters , @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xcite : @xmath12.\\ ] ] here the free parameters are real numbers .",
    "author s hope is that this distribution fits better the distribution of vote , but the daisy models offers a more physical interpretations as explained in @xcite . in this way",
    ", i present the third prediction :    even when pri lost presidential election in 2000 and 2004 there were few polling stations with a small number of votes for this political party , hence it is unlike ( but not impossible ) that such an event occurs in the present election when its presidential candidate had been at the head in all the polls .",
    "notice that even when its candidate shall not win the election the distribution of votes could show a polynomial grow .",
    "this work was supported by promep / sep and projects from cbi - uam - a .",
    "i thank to a. kunold , j.l . cardoso and e. vrguez for encouragement and support .",
