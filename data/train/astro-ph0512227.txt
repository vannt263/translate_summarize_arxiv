    "whether from supermassive objects in galactic nuclei or stellar mass objects in galactic binaries , outflows  often relativistic  are frequently seen from black holes . however , there is little that is known with confidence about their nature and dynamics .",
    "the essential ingredients are , of course , well - known : magnetic field , accretion , and rotation .",
    "but basic questions such as the forces that drive the jets , the mechanisms that regulate their content , and the constraints that collimate them remain open .",
    "magneto - centrifugal effects have received the greatest attention ( blandford & znajek 1977 ; blandford & payne 1981 ; shibata & uchida 1985 ; punsly & coroniti 1990 ) , but there are many possible variations on this idea . in most such studies , magnetic field boundary conditions",
    "are guessed and their consequences derived without much consideration of how the posited field structures would arise in the context of accretion flows .",
    "we approach these questions from the opposite point of view : we simulate numerically how accretion dynamics self - consistently create magnetic field and explore the outflows that result . employing the general relativistic three dimensional mhd code described in de villiers & hawley ( 2003 ) , we have previously investigated the general character of accretion onto black holes in a series of simulations for which an overview is presented in de villiers , hawley & krolik ( 2003 ; hereafter paper  i ) .",
    "the magnetic field structures that develop in these accretion flows were described in hirose et al .",
    "( 2004 ; hereafter paper  ii ) .",
    "we discussed the resulting outflows in de villiers et al .",
    "( 2005 ; hereafter paper  iii ) , and the dynamics of the inner disk in krolik , hawley , & hirose ( 2005 ; hereafter paper  iv ) . in this paper",
    "we return to a more in - depth consideration of the type of unbound outflows that were discussed in paper  iii",
    ". we will present a more quantitative and dynamically - oriented analysis of the outflows , and draw on several new simulations designed to elucidate their properties .",
    "we will focus our attention on three issues in particular : the underlying principles governing the material component in the outflow ; the dynamics and spin - dependence of the outflow s electromagnetic segment ; and the relationship between the electromagnetic contribution and the class of ideas placed under the heading of the blandford - znajek mechanism .",
    "in the present work we solve the equations of ideal mhd in the metric of a rotating black hole , while assuming that the gas is adiabatic except in regions of strong compression , where an artificial bulk viscosity is employed to capture the entropy produced in shocks .",
    "the specific form of the equations we solve , and the numerical algorithms incorporated into the grmhd code , are described in detail in de villiers & hawley ( 2003 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we present several new simulations , which , like the simulations reported in papers i  iv , follow the evolution of an isolated magnetized gas torus orbiting near a black hole .",
    "the new simulations differ from the previous ones in part because of several small technical changes in the code that permitted generation of new , improved versions of previously - published simulations ( e.g. , raising the cap on the lorentz factor , saving additional data , extending the radial grid closer to the horizon for @xmath2 ) . in addition",
    ", we have studied several new high - spin cases : @xmath3 , 0.95 , and 0.99 , and a case with a counter - rotating black hole , @xmath4 .",
    "the late - time structure of all our simulations contains the same basic elements pointed out in paper  i , although their relative importance and location can change considerably as a function of black hole spin .",
    "these structures are illustrated in figure  [ fig : simsum ] , a schematic of the accretion system as outlined in papers i through iv .",
    "along the equator there is a somewhat thickened , wedge - shaped keplerian accretion disk .",
    "a net accretion flow is produced within this disk by mhd turbulence whose ultimate origin is the magneto - rotational instability ( balbus & hawley 1998 ) . in the disk , the magnetic field is subthermal ; the ratio of the gas to magnetic pressures , i.e. , @xmath5 , is on average on order 10 to 100 .",
    "a short distance outside the marginally stable orbit around the black hole , the equatorial pressure and density reach a local maximum in a region we refer to as the inner torus . the location and vertical thickness of this inner torus",
    "can and does vary as a function of time throughout a simulation . inside this local pressure maximum , the density and pressure drop as the flow accelerates inward toward the black hole in the plunging region .",
    "the plunging region typically begins near the innermost marginally stable circular orbit of the black hole , @xmath6 .",
    "the high latitude region above and below the disk is the corona , a region of hot , magnetized plasma with a magnetic field whose strength is , on average , near equipartition ( @xmath7 ) . along the spin axis of the black hole",
    "there is a centrifugal funnel that is largely empty of matter , but filled with magnetic field .",
    "this magnetic field transports energy outward in the form of a poynting flux .",
    "there is a region of unbound mass flux at the boundary between the evacuated funnel and the corona which we refer to as the funnel wall jet .",
    "this funnel and its boundary are , of course , the center of attention in this paper .",
    "the grmhd code we employ for this study solves the equations of ideal mhd in the metric of a rotating kerr black hole of mass @xmath8 in three spatial dimensions expressed in boyer - lindquist coordinates , @xmath9 .",
    "we use the metric signature @xmath10 .",
    "the determinant of the 4-metric is @xmath11 , @xmath12 , where the lapse function @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the determinant of the spatial @xmath15-metric .",
    "we follow the usual convention of using greek characters to denote full space - time indices and roman characters for purely spatial indices .",
    "we use geometrodynamic units where @xmath16 ; time and distance are in units of the black hole mass , @xmath8 .",
    "the spin of the black hole is specified by @xmath17 , with @xmath18 .",
    "the primitive variables that describe a relativistic test fluid are its density @xmath19 , specific internal energy @xmath20 , four - velocity @xmath21 , isotropic pressure @xmath22 , and magnetic field four - vector @xmath23 .",
    "the relativistic enthalpy is @xmath24 .",
    "the pressure is related to @xmath19 and @xmath20 through the equation of state of an ideal gas , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the adiabatic exponent . for these simulations",
    "we take @xmath27 .",
    "the code evolves auxiliary variables constructed from the relativistic boost factor @xmath28 , namely @xmath29 , @xmath30 , a four - momentum @xmath31 , and a transport velocity @xmath32 .",
    "the magnetic field of the fluid is evolved using the constrained transport magnetic field , @xmath33\\,{\\cal{b}}^i$ ] , from which the magnetic field four - vector @xmath34 is constructed .",
    "the ideal mhd condition requires @xmath35 .",
    "the algorithms employed in this grmhd code resemble those of the well - known zeus code ( stone & norman 1994a , b ) used for nonrelativistic astrophysical mhd simulations .",
    "the evolution is divided into a transport step , where quantities are advected through the grid by the velocities @xmath36 , and a source step where forces are applied .",
    "we use the constrained transport approach for the induction equation ( evans & hawley 1988 ) so that the magnetic field @xmath37 remains divergence - free .",
    "the evolution timestep is set by the smallest light - crossing time through a grid zone .",
    "in contrast to some alternative numerical schemes that have been developed for general relativistic mhd ( e.g. , gammie , mckinney & tth 2003 ; komissarov 2004 ) our scheme is not fully conservative . rather than evolve the stress - energy tensor directly ,",
    "we work with the auxiliary variables from which the primitive variables are easily recovered .",
    "we evolve only the three spatial components of the four - momentum and use velocity normalization to obtain the @xmath38 component .",
    "the boost factor @xmath39 is then computed using @xmath40 , but because the definition of the inertia used in the code includes @xmath39 , it is found from the solution to a quartic equation derived from four - normalization ( de villiers , staff , & ouyed 2005 ) .",
    "the internal energy is evolved independently . an artificial viscosity is included to thermalize some of the kinetic energy lost in shocks , but there is no mechanism included to capture magnetic energy lost through magnetic reconnection .",
    "it is worthwhile to review briefly some of the known strengths and weaknesses of the grmhd code . in tests and applications carried out to date",
    "the code has proven to be fast and robust , capable of carrying out long - term simulations in three spatial dimensions . indeed , as of the time of the writing of this paper , this is the only code that has been able to perform long - term ( several thousand @xmath8 in time ) three - dimensional grmhd simulations .",
    "the code handles both the weak field ( i.e. , high @xmath41 ) limit within the accretion disk and the strong fields ( @xmath42 ) found in the evacuated funnel .",
    "comparisons between simulations using nonrotating black holes and nonrelativistic simulations using the zeus code show good qualitative agreement within the region where gravity is well approximated by a pseudo - newtonian potential .",
    "our simulations also show qualitative agreement with the axisymmetric simulations of black hole accretion carried out by mckinney & gammie ( 2004 ) .",
    "one of the limitations of the code is that there must be a minimum floor on the fluid density , set in the simulations of this paper at @xmath43 of the initial density maximum .",
    "this density floor value is chosen simply to provide a wide dynamic range between the density within the matter - dominated regions and the region that should be regarded as the numerical `` vacuum . '' to prevent possible numerical instability in near - vacuum zones we place a cap on the value of the boost factor ; here @xmath44 or @xmath45 . because we evolve an internal energy equation , the thermodynamics are only approximate .",
    "some amount of energy that would otherwise be thermalized ( e.g. , in magnetic reconnection ) is lost .",
    "as we have no explicit cooling , the disks grow hot as they accrete , but not as hot as they would be with complete energy conservation .",
    "conversely , of course , they are not as cool as they might be if radiation losses were taken into account .    because we use boyer - lindquist coordinates ,",
    "the horizon represents a coordinate singularity , and our inner grid boundary , @xmath46 , must lie outside this point .",
    "the metric terms increase rapidly near the inner boundary , making accurate numerical calculations there more difficult . in practice",
    "we select an inner radius such that the kerr metric term @xmath47 is approximately @xmath48@xmath49 . as a result ,",
    "the spacetime rotation frequency at @xmath46 is less than that of the horizon .",
    "the inner boundary uses zero gradient conditions on the fundamental variables , and the radial velocity and momentum at @xmath46 are not allowed to become positive .    even apart from the coordinate singularities at the horizon in boyer - lindquist coordinates",
    ", it is well known that spherical coordinates have a singularity along the axis . as a practical matter ,",
    "the closer one is to the @xmath50 or @xmath51 axis , the more narrow and wedge - like the @xmath52 zones become , leading to a substantial reduction in the courant - limited timestep among other problems . to avoid this",
    ", we set the @xmath53 boundary not at the axis but at a small angle off the axis and employ reflecting boundary conditions .",
    "this means that with our grid we can not follow a flow passing over the north or south pole of the black hole .",
    "these conditions imposed on the computational grid will , of course , affect the results .",
    "the `` torque '' applied by the rotating spacetime will be limited to that provided exterior to the inner boundary , @xmath54 , and there will be no jet power along the cutout on the axis .",
    "the numbers reported for the models should not be regarded as quantitatively predictive of the jet power a black hole with a specific @xmath0 value would have in nature .",
    "rather we are interested in the relative values of quantities across the full complement of the simulations and what that can mean for the role of a rotating hole in the combined accretion plus jet production process .",
    "it is important to keep these code limitations in perspective .",
    "as no numerical scheme is perfect , all simulators must make choices .",
    "there are often alternatives that can address one specific limitation , but introduce new limitations of their own .",
    "for example , the problems associated with a spherical mesh can be eliminated through the use of a cartesian grid , but then angular momentum is no longer a directly conserved fundamental variable and maintaining a simple orbit becomes a matter of carefully balancing forces acting on distinct linear momentum components .",
    "diffusion error associated with motion across the grid can then be a significant source of nonphysical viscosity in an accretion disk .",
    "when evolving a total energy equation , the internal energy is defined as what remains after all other independently evolved energies ( kinetic , magnetic ) have been subtracted off .",
    "if the internal energy is a small fraction of the total energy ( as it is whenever @xmath55 ) , its evolution can be dominated by truncation errors in the kinetic and magnetic components . in relativity ,",
    "the derivation of primitive variables from conserved quantities is difficult and time - consuming .    at this stage",
    "the only practical approach is to simulate well - chosen problems with a variety of numerical codes and to evaluate the outcomes both in comparison to other results and with self - consistency checks , keeping a specific code s limitations firmly in mind .      for this paper",
    "we have computed a new set of models in a spherical quadrant computational domain .",
    "the inner radial boundary , denoted @xmath46 , is placed just outside the event horizon ( the exact amount varying from case to case ) , and the outer radial boundary is at @xmath56 .",
    "the azimuthal angle ranges over @xmath57 and the polar angle over @xmath58 .",
    "the radial boundary conditions are pure outflow , the azimuthal boundary conditions are periodic , and the boundary conditions near the polar axis are reflecting .",
    "the grid consists of 192 radial cells spaced using a hyperbolic cosine function in order to maximize the resolution near the inner boundary , 192 polar angle cells , with an exponential grid spacing function that concentrates zones near the equator , and 64 evenly - spaced cells in azimuthal angle .",
    "this resolution is close to the maximum feasible at this time for computing an ensemble of three dimensional simulations .",
    "these models are of the same form as the kd models described in paper  i. since those simulations were run , we have added new run - time diagnostics and have studied a greater range of black hole spin parameters : @xmath59 , 0 . , 0.5 , 0.9 , 0.93 , 0,95 , and 0.99 .",
    "note that we have included one case with a black hole that is counter - rotating with respect to the disk . as in paper",
    "i , the initial conditions consist of an orbiting isolated gas torus with a pressure maximum located at @xmath60 , and a slightly sub - keplerian initial distribution of angular momentum throughout .",
    "we construct an initial torus so that its inner edge is located at @xmath61 regardless of the black hole spin rate .",
    "the initial magnetic field consists of loops of weak poloidal field lying along isodensity surfaces within the torus .",
    "the strength of the magnetic field is chosen so that the ratio of the total magnetic pressure to the initial total gas pressure in the torus is 0.01 ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "table  [ table : sims ] lists the models along with some reference values such as the radius of the marginally stable orbit , @xmath63 , and the frame - dragging rate at the inner grid boundary , @xmath64 .",
    "the strength of the outflow may be characterized by how much mass , linear momentum , angular momentum , and energy it carries to large distance .",
    "we compute these measures through shell - integrated fluxes that are calculated using @xmath65 for quantity @xmath66 at radius @xmath67 , where the bounds of integration range over the full @xmath53 and @xmath52 computational domains .",
    "these fluxes are computed and stored every @xmath8 in time , and integrating the flux over time yields the total outflow or accretion rate .",
    "whenever we speak of mean properties of the outflow , we require a criterion to distinguish those cells participating in the outflow from those in the accretion flow .",
    "our definition of  outflow \" is any cell with @xmath68 ( i.e. , that is unbound ) and with @xmath69 ( i.e. , moving outward ) .",
    "this criterion works well for these simulatons , as only the outflow near the axis ( the `` jet '' outflow ) is unbound ; the backflow from the disk itself remains bound . in practice",
    "we divide the shell integrals into two parts , one for bound and one for unbound flow .",
    "we will indicate the shell integrals specific to either the outflow or the accretion flow by multiplying the integrand by either @xmath70 or @xmath71 , where @xmath70 is a function whose value is unity in outflow cells and zero otherwise .    in the present work we are concerned with the strength of the jet compared to what is accreted into the hole .",
    "we would like to characterize the outflows in terms of the accretion rate , but this can be ambiguous because of the scale - free nature of these simulations ( code values of density are arbitrary ) , and the fact that the total mass of the initial torus is a function of black hole spin .",
    "we proceed by computing the total mass , angular momentum and energy ( in code units ) that leave the grid going into the black hole ; these are the `` hole '' values .",
    "second we compute the total _ unbound _",
    "mass , angular momentum and energy that pass through @xmath72 ; these are the `` jet '' values . to focus on the quasi - steady state portion of the simulation , we compute these totals from @xmath73 to @xmath74 .",
    "these integrated quantities are listed in tables  [ table : mflux ] , [ table : lflux ] and [ table : eflux ] , along with measures of the outflow efficiency . for the case of the angular momentum and energy fluxes , we further distinguish between that carried by the matter ( superscript @xmath75 ) and that carried by the electromagnetic fields ( superscript @xmath76 ) .",
    "the efficiencies are defined as @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the total rest - mass accreted into the black hole , while @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the rest - mass and energy carried off through the @xmath72 surface .",
    "rest - mass energy is subtracted from the matter portion so that the efficiency refers only to  usable \" energy .",
    "in addition to relative efficiency , it is also useful to compared to the standard novikov - thorne ( novikov & thorne 1973 ) thin disk efficiency , which is the binding energy of the innermost stable circular orbit .",
    "these efficiencies are also listed in table  [ table : eflux ] .    before discussing these numbers",
    ", we must first express a caution : the fluxes are , in general , not constant in time or radius .",
    "total ( i.e. , electromagnetic plus matter ) quantities can depend on radius , even in the long - term average . even where the total is constant , electromagnetic fields and matter",
    "can , and do , exchange energy and momentum . in most cases , for example",
    ", the em outflow rates reach a peak at several tens of gravitational radii and decline slowly from there to the outer boundary .",
    "in contrast , the magnitude of the time - averaged rest - mass expulsion rate increases monotonically toward the outside , although its rate of increase decreases with growing distance from the center . in a strict sense , the outflow numbers apply only at our fiducial outflow radius @xmath72 .",
    "consequently , the numbers we give in the tables should be regarded as useful for comparing relative changes between simulations , and to study how outflow properties depend on black hole spin , not as providing some sort of absolute measure of jet power .",
    "examining the table of mass and energy flows , the most obvious conclusion is that for rapidly - rotating black holes the jet efflux is not insignificant compared to what is accreted . in other words ,",
    "the jet plays a noticeable role in the global energy budget of accreting black holes .",
    "the mass outflow is all within the funnel wall jet , whereas the poynting flux outflow is primarily within the funnel itself .",
    "the ratio of jet mass to accretion mass is generally a few percent , although it rises steeply from @xmath81 to @xmath82 .",
    "moreover , although the trend in these simulation data is not monotonic , there is a general tendency for the expelled energy to increase sharply with increasing black hole spin .",
    "the outflows are almost nil in the schwarzschild case , weak when @xmath83 , and become substantial when @xmath84 .    when @xmath84 , the total jet efficiency is generally several tens of percent , with the matter portion somewhat larger than the electromagnetic part .",
    "the retrograde case is less efficient in driving a jet than the prograde case with the same magnitude of spin , but only by a factor of two .",
    "interestingly , in otherwise similar simulations most of whose results closely resemble ours , mckinney ( 2005 ) remarks that he finds the retrograde jet efficiency to be smaller by a factor of ten .",
    "the ratio of angular momentum in the unbound outflow to that deposited in the black hole is also a very strong function of black hole spin .",
    "only a few tenths of a percent in the schwarzschild case , it rises to @xmath85 when @xmath2 . in the highest spin case reported here ( @xmath82 ) , the _ net _",
    "angular momentum accreted is extremely small because the rate at which the black hole spins down via electromagnetic torques nearly matches the rate at which it acquires angular momentum by accreting matter .",
    "consequently , the angular momentum expelled in the outflow is an order of magnitude _",
    "greater _ than the net amount captured . in all cases ,",
    "the electromagnetic portion of the angular momentum carried outward is comparable to the matter portion carried in the funnel wall jet .",
    "note in particular that the electromagnetic angular momentum carried outward in the retrograde case has the opposite sign relative to the accreting matter s orbital angular momentum .",
    "one consequence of this is that the net angular momentum outflow in this case is very small because the electromagnetic part very nearly cancels the matter part .",
    "this fact is also an indication ( that will be confirmed in the following section ) that the electromagnetic outflow is directly tied to the black hole s rotation .",
    "in the initial state there is no magnetic field at all within what eventually becomes the outflow region .",
    "all of the simulations presented here rapidly develop a large scale field within the funnel , which in turn leads to the formation of the poynting flux jet .",
    "this is one of the significant results of simulations of this type ( see also paper i and ii , as well as mckinney & gammie 2004 ) , namely that a large scale , jet - driving magnetic field can develop naturally as the result of magnetically controlled accretion .",
    "this funnel field formation process may conveniently be visualized in terms of three steps .",
    "these are illustrated in the panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : fieldeject ] , which show the evolution of the @xmath86 parameter in the inner region of the inflow in run kdpg .",
    "first , as the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) develops in the disk , matter begins to move inward .",
    "the magnetic field is stretched radially , and this radial field is sheared into an increasingly strong toroidal field .",
    "an extremely thin precursor of matter moves quickly inward in the equatorial plane , surrounded by a thicker envelope of magnetically - dominated ( @xmath87 ) matter .",
    "the matter density above and below the equatorial accretion flow is very low , in part because of the initial conditions .",
    "however , the expectation of low density above and below the plunging inflow is likely to be general because it is the centrifugally - excluded zone .",
    "when the accretion flow reaches the black hole , matter can drain off the field lines .",
    "the vertical component of @xmath88 is then great enough to drive a vertical expansion of the field ( center panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : fieldeject ] ) .",
    "a  magnetic tower \" forms , as has previously been predicted on analytic grounds ( lynden - bell 2003 ) and seen in other simulations ( kato , mineshige , & shibata 2004 ) .",
    "it lasts for a time @xmath89@xmath90 .",
    "the steady - state structure is created in the third step . because the top of the  magnetic tower \" expands more rapidly than its base",
    ", the toroidal wrapping of field lines stretches into a less tightly - wound helix . to stretch the field from the  tower \" region @xmath91 from the plane all the way to the outer boundary requires only @xmath92 in time because the motion is relativistic .",
    "when this happens in a schwarzschild metric , the field lines end up very nearly radial ; with increasing black hole spin , the field lines wind more tightly ( paper  ii ) .",
    "that is , it is only the intrinsically general relativistic effect of frame - dragging that in the steady state imparts a net helical twist to the field far from the black hole .",
    "any remnant of the  tower \" that persists in the long - run is not due to mhd accretion dynamics ; it is , rather , an imprint of the rotating metric .    as discussed in paper  ii ,",
    "the interior of the outflow funnel is magnetically - dominated in the sense that @xmath93 .",
    "values of this ratio in the range @xmath94@xmath95 are common . however , we stress that the particular value of @xmath96 found in the funnel is not well - determined in these simulations .",
    "the density reaches the floor value at late time in much of the funnel .",
    "this occurs for all values of the floor that have been tested ; clearly the funnel is being evacuated . except for some low density initial background material ,",
    "the matter on the grid all has angular momentum , and this prevents it from entering the axial funnel .",
    "thus the finding that the funnel should be evacuated is expected , and our results should simply be taken as saying that the magnetic energy density is likely to be at least several orders of magnitude greater than @xmath96 .",
    "the steady - state funnel field is illustrated in figure  [ fig : brbphratio ] , which shows the ratio of radial to azimuthal components of the magnetic field in the outflow at a late time in three of the simulations . because the @xmath97 term in the metric becomes small",
    "when @xmath98 , and the focus here is on behavior at large distances , we have approximated this ratio as if the metric were purely diagonal , i.e. , we have plotted the ratio @xmath99 .",
    "as the figure shows , the field is very purely radial when the black hole does not spin , but grows progressively more toroidal with increasing black hole rotation rate .",
    "for intermediate values of spin , the field is more nearly radial near the polar axis , more toroidal at larger angles .",
    "if this flow were time - steady and axi - symmetric , it would make sense to discuss the rate at which the poloidal portion of the field rotates around the axis . under those conditions the fieldline rotation rate",
    "is defined as @xmath100 or equivalently as @xmath101 . here , because the situation is neither axi - symmetric nor stationary , the concept of fieldline rotation rate is not so clear . nonetheless , in order to provide some intuition by comparison to a more familiar context",
    ", we construct a local and instantaneous definition of fieldline rotation rate : @xmath102 the second term describes how fast matter slips along the toroidal field relative to the rotation of the poloidal part . in the time - steady axi - symmetric limit , equation  [ eq : fieldlinerot ] reduces to the standard definition of fieldline rotation ( as found , e.g. , in phinney 1983 ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fieldrot ] we show how this definition of the rotation rate compares to specific predictions made in the context of the blandford - znajek model .",
    "when , for example , the fieldlines are radial , it is expected that the rotation rate close to the polar axis should be half the black hole rotation rate ( blandford & znajek 1977 ; phinney 1983 ) . to make this comparison",
    ", we must average over both position along individual fieldlines and over time .",
    "for the former average , we make use of the fact that the flow is nearly conical at large radius , and define @xmath103 where we choose @xmath104 in order to restrict the average to the nearly conical region . in practise , although we see substantial fluctuations in @xmath105 as a function of radius at fixed @xmath53 , we see little in the way of systematic trends with radius in this outer region , so the exact range of averaging should not make much difference .",
    "the details differ slightly as a function of time within any one simulation and also from simulation to simulation .",
    "for example , the behavior of the field line rotation at the axis boundary varies , sometimes dropping off as in figure  [ fig : fieldrot ] and sometimes increasing .",
    "( recall that the axis has a reflecting boundary condition applied at @xmath106 . ) within the main part of the funnel , however , things are more consistent from model to model .",
    "the fieldline rotation rate is close to , but generally @xmath107@xmath108 smaller than , half the spacetime rotation rate of the inner boundary ( see table  [ table : sims ] ) .",
    "we use this criterion rather than half the rotation rate of the black hole itself because the latter quantity plays no direct role in our simulation . the difference between",
    "the classical prediction and the observed rotation rate in our results is larger than that observed in the two - dimensional simulations of mckinney & gammie ( 2004 ) .",
    "they found that , within the force - free part of the outflow , the rotation rate was about @xmath109 less than half the black hole rotation rate .",
    "we further find that the rotation rate of the funnel fieldlines is always in the black hole s sense ; that is , in the retrograde case , the fieldlines rotate in the same direction as the black hole , but in the opposite direction of the accreting matter .",
    "specifically , defining the black hole spin as in the positive direction , when the disk and the black hole rotate in opposite senses , the rotation of the funnel - wall matter is backward , and , at large radius , of smaller magnitude than the fieldline rotation .",
    "this contrast underlines the fact that the fieldlines rotation is fundamentally a result of frame - dragging in the ergosphere .",
    "interestingly , the mean rotation rate in the retrograde case is actually considerably closer to half the rotation at the inner boundary than it is in the prograde cases .    finally , although we have hopes of finding large - scale field - generation processes that are completely general , we note that the funnel field formation seen here does depend in certain ways upon the problem configuration .",
    "first , the crucial ingredient is the presence of radial field extending through the plunging region as material first accretes into the hole .",
    "the polarity of this field , and of the subsequent funnel field , is a consequence of the initial field configuration , namely poloidal loops with one sign of the radial field above the equator and the opposite sign below .",
    "a simulation with a purely toroidal initial field ( discussed in paper iii ) is a counter - example that does not form an organized funnel field .",
    "second , the initial plunging inflow is surrounded by a near - vacuum which offers no opposition to the formation of the magnetic tower .",
    "third , the accretion flow is relatively hot , with @xmath110 .",
    "it is possible that thinner , colder disks would not generate sufficiently strong fields to create the magnetic tower ; additional simulations will be necessary in order to explore the degree of generality of this large - scale field - generation mechanism .      in the time - steady , axi - symmetric limit in which it is possible to define clearly a fieldline rotation rate ,",
    "the poynting flux on the inner boundary can be described in terms of the magnetic field strength and the fieldline rotation rate : @xmath111 where @xmath112 and @xmath113 are the standard functions appearing in the boyer - lindquist metric ( blandford & znajek 1977 ) .",
    "although @xmath114 as the event horizon is approached , the magnetic field strength diverges in an appropriate way to make @xmath115 continuous . in the specific circumstances envisaged by blandford & znajek ( 1977 )",
    ", the polar angle dependence of the magnetic field intensity follows from the condition of satisfying a force - free equilibrium for a field of specified multipolar character .",
    "they predict that for a split monopolar field it should diminish by about 20% from the axis to the midplane .",
    "in addition , they predict that the fieldline rotation rate should be close to 1/2 the black hole rotation rate almost independent of polar angle , so the overall polar angle dependence of the poynting flux should be almost @xmath116 .    in our simulation , we find that the magnetic field sufficiently dominates the matter inside the funnel that a force - free configuration might be expected on average ( although certainly not obtained instantaneously , as the fluctuations are large ) , while the detailed dynamics of the coupled accretion and jet flows determine the geometry of the field . in the simulations with @xmath117 , the time - averaged distribution of @xmath115 ( calculated directly from the electromagnetic contributions to @xmath118 , not from equation  [ eqn : bzpoynting ] ) does indeed vary with polar angle very nearly as @xmath119 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : poynting ] ) . however , this equilibrium structure is not necessarily realized at any given time , for there are tens of percent fluctuations around the mean value . in the larger spin cases ,",
    "these fluctuations are larger in magnitude . even after averaging over some 27 snapshots ,",
    "the polar angle dependence of the poynting flux in the @xmath81 case is still quite rough .",
    "it is also noteworthy that , although the poynting flux goes inward in the midplane accretion flow at lower spins , for @xmath120 , it is outward almost everywhere , even within the equatorial accretion flow . the overall pattern seen in the @xmath81 case  a rise from the polar axis to mid - latitudes , a sharp drop at an angle @xmath121 from the pole , and irregularly - distributed but intense outgoing flux nearer the midplane ",
    "was also seen in the two dimensional @xmath122 simulation of mckinney & gammie ( 2004 ) .",
    "we confirm by direct examination of the complete data files at late time that the mass outflow in the jets is confined to the funnel wall component .",
    "in fact within the funnel at the radius for which the outflow fluxes are measured , @xmath72 , the density inside the funnel has dropped to the floor value ; matter is , of course , excluded from the funnel if it has significant angular momentum .",
    "the mass - weighted mean angular momentum in the funnel - wall outflow can be computed as @xmath123 this quantity is always comparable to the angular momentum of keplerian orbits in the innermost part of the disk .",
    "for example , in kdpg , @xmath124 rises from @xmath125 at the base of the outflow ( @xmath126 ) to @xmath127 at the outer boundary ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : angmomdist ] ) ; by comparison , @xmath128 . at higher spin",
    ", @xmath124 can rise as high as @xmath129 , or roughly twice @xmath130 .    because the mean specific angular momentum changes little through the outflow , it makes sense to describe the outflow dynamics as taking place with respect to a single effective potential @xmath131\\right\\}.\\ ] ] that is , @xmath132 is the energy @xmath133 a test particle would have if orbiting with @xmath134 and @xmath135 at a given location .",
    "we display the correspondence between the mass outflow and the shape of this effective potential in figure  [ fig : angmomequipot ] .",
    "two examples are presented , @xmath136 , for which @xmath137 , and @xmath59 , for which @xmath138 . in both",
    ", the mass flow must climb in the effective potential out to @xmath139 , but  slides \" at roughly constant potential from there outward .",
    "although illustrated only for these two cases , this pattern is generally seen in the other high - spin simulations as well .",
    "it should not be too surprising that , for the most part , the outflow moves through the region of least effective potential permitting access to infinity .",
    "thus , the shape of the mass outflow ( at least in the inner few tens of gravitational radii ) is determined by two factors : its specific angular momentum ( which is the angular momentum of the inner disk ) and the gravitational potential .",
    "a corollary of the importance of the effective potential is that there is very little mass outflow ( or mass ) at polar angles closer to the axis than the lowest open effective potential contour .",
    "the angular momentum of the matter creates a centrifugal barrier that prevents matter from filling in the funnel .",
    "since the only source of mass is the accretion disk , the funnel is empty . in general , provided there is little matter of truly small angular momentum anywhere in the system , we expect that the mass flux in _ all _ such outflows should trace out a hollow cone , while the interior of the cone should have very low density .",
    "the sharp density gradient in polar angle at the inner edge of the funnel wall outflow poses a difficulty for numerical simulations : an extremely fine gridscale is required in the vicinity of the centrifugal barrier .",
    "the simulations reported here , while well - resolved in terms of density elsewhere , fail to describe the sharpness of this gradient .",
    "the fractional contrast in density from one cell to the next ( moving purely in @xmath53 ) on the inner edge of the funnel wall is typically @xmath14010 . because of this poor resolution at the edge of the funnel",
    ", the rest - mass and internal energy content of the funnel interior may not be well - described quantitatively . because there is negligible matter in the simulation with small enough angular momentum to enter the funnel interior , anything found there came either from invocation of the numerical density floor , or via numerical diffusion that resulted in a low ratio of angular momentum to matter .",
    "of course this process of angular momentum `` filtration '' should exist in real systems , since only very low angular momentum material is allowed within the funnel .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to estimate how much truly low angular momentum matter may be found close to the center of an accretion flow  so little mass is needed in order to substantially change the content of the funnel interior that many physical processes , justly neglected in the rest of the simulation , may contribute . for these reasons",
    ", we can not be quantitative regarding the matter content in the funnel interior .      although the mass density inside the funnel is ill - determined , the mass density in the funnel wall , where substantially all of the unbound mass outflow takes place , is much more reliable .",
    "we can therefore examine how the rate of mass loss in the outflow compares to the accretion rate , and how this changes as a function of black hole spin .    however , there are certain cautions that attach even to this quantity .",
    "first , the ratio of mass outflow rate to mass accretion rate is meaningful only when averaged over long time intervals that exclude the initial transients . on the one hand ,",
    "the accretion rate into the black hole is highly variable , and the timescales of these variations are often quite short , while on the other hand , the outflow varies more slowly because its characteristic timescale @xmath141 is comparatively long .",
    "in addition , there are large amplitude transients in both the mass inflow and outflow rates that typically occur @xmath142 after the beginning of each simulation .",
    "we therefore consider the ratio between the total mass lost in in the outflow to the total rest - mass accreted over the time 3000@xmath74 .",
    "second , although the density gradient within the funnel wall outflow is modest , its angular width in terms of cells is only about half a dozen .",
    "thus , there remains a noticeable numerical uncertainty in any quantity integrated over the funnel wall .",
    "third , the distinction between unbound and bound mass flow is a subtle one . wherever there is significant mass along the outer boundary ,",
    "it is moving outward .",
    "the specific energy ( @xmath143 ) varies smoothly with polar angle at this boundary , so that while one can define a boundary at @xmath144 , there is no sharp dividing line in energy between the unbound and bound outflow near the funnel wall .",
    "finally , as shown in paper  iii , the mean unbound mass outflow rate increases with increasing radius . beyond @xmath145 ,",
    "the scaling is slow ( roughly @xmath146 ) , but it is clearly still varying within our simulation volume .",
    "consequently , we stress that the numbers given are the mass flows _ at a fiducial large radius _ , and _ not _ necessarily the mass flow that would reach infinity .    the mass outflow data , subject as they are to all these _ caveats _ , are given in table [ table : mflux ] .",
    "very little mass is expelled in the schwarzschild black hole model .",
    "when @xmath0 exceeds 0.9 , the rate begins to rise sharply .",
    "it is noteworthy that the mass loss rate relative to the accretion rate in the retrograde case , @xmath4 , is almost the same as in the prograde case with the same magnitude spin parameter .",
    "there is little apparent trend between @xmath2 and 0.95 ; for all these simulations , the mass loss rate is @xmath147 of the accretion rate .",
    "the scatter between these numbers is likely an estimate of ( or perhaps a lower bound on ) their uncertainty . at the highest spin , 0.99 ,",
    "the mass lost in the funnel wall outflow is nearly a quarter of the mass accreted by the black hole .    similarly , the average mass outflow velocity is at least partially a function of black hole spin .",
    "we compute an average velocity by the ratio of the time - averaged funnel wall mass flux to the time - averaged density in the funnel wall jet . as with many quantities ,",
    "the value of the velocity is a function of radius . for the @xmath148 model ,",
    "the mean funnel wall jet velocity is @xmath149 at @xmath72 .",
    "the retrograde spin model has a comparable jet velocity , while the velocity at @xmath72 increases to @xmath1500.4 for the high spin models .",
    "we now embark on a search , at a qualitative level , for the forces responsible for driving this outflow .",
    "the most elementary evidence in this regard can be seen in figure  [ fig : momflux ] , which shows the azimuthally - averaged matter momentum outflow in the funnel - wall , i.e. , @xmath151 we omit the factor @xmath152 from the expression for the momentum density in order to suppress contributions from the funnel interior ; @xmath153 everywhere in the funnel wall .",
    "as this figure shows , the matter momentum outflow in the funnel wall increases out to @xmath145 .",
    "time - dependent fluctuations cause the momentum outflow to vary with increasing radius at larger distance , but without any consistent trend .",
    "moreover , the track of the momentum outflow follows a path along which the effective potential hardly changes .",
    "figure  [ fig : angmomdist ] also provides evidence pointing toward the same conclusion .",
    "the figure illustrates that the mean specific angular momentum in the funnel - wall hardly changes with radius .",
    "thus , the effect of any torques must be quite minor .",
    "these results indicate that while centrifugal effects help guide the outflow , they do _ not _ accelerate it : other forces must be responsible for its radial acceleration .",
    "to ascertain just what these forces are , we look at the problem from a different point of view . in paper  iii , we demonstrated that mass in the outflow is acquired rapidly in the range between a few @xmath6 and @xmath154 , but continues to grow slowly with increasing radius beyond that point . in order for mass to be introduced to the outflow over such a broad range of radii",
    ", the acceleration region must be distributed along the length of the funnel wall .",
    "just such a situation can be seen in figure  [ fig : mach ] . in that figure , we show a newtonian approximation to the mach number relative to the magnetosonic speed , i.e. , @xmath155 , where @xmath156/(||b||^2+h\\rho)$ ] . regions outside the unbound outflow are suppressed in this figure . from @xmath139 to the outside , the transonic contour follows the outside edge of the funnel - wall .",
    "that is , fresh matter is both injected and accelerated along the length of the jet . in much of the funnel interior ,",
    "the flow is sub - magnetosonic because @xmath157 is so large that @xmath158 ; at larger radii in the funnel interior , @xmath159 , so that , in this sense , the flow approaches mach number unity .    pressure forces account for this distributed acceleration .",
    "figure  [ fig : pressuredist ] shows the total pressure ( more precisely , @xmath160 ) compared to the radial matter momentum flux in the outflow ( @xmath161 ) .",
    "the pressure contours are oblique to the momentum flux contours , angled at such a way as to push matter into the outflow as well as to accelerate it radially .",
    "matter is prevented from moving deeper into the funnel interior by the sharp rise in the effective potential ( cf .",
    "[ fig : momflux ] ) . in the coronal region",
    "generally , and near the funnel wall in particular , the magnetic and gas pressures are comparable to one another .",
    "interestingly , the contours of both the gas pressure and the magnetic pressure considered alone are significantly more irregular than the contours of their sum .",
    "we have already demonstrated that the inner edge of the matter outflow is determined by the centrifugal barrier in the inner few tens of gravitational radii , and that its flow beyond that distance is essentially ballistic within the nearly - flat effective potential .",
    "the electromagnetic fields in the funnel interior expand to fill the hollow region , so the matter s dynamics determine the edge of the electromagnetically - dominated funnel interior .",
    "the outer edge of the matter outflow ( funnel wall jet ) is less sharply marked .",
    "the specific energy ( @xmath162 ) is a smooth function of polar angle at large radius , and there is no sharp division between bound and unbound regions .",
    "similarly , the pressure is likewise smoothly varying ( cf .",
    "paper  iii ) . in this sense",
    ", we consider the outflow to be collimated by the coronal pressure . for",
    "this reason , future work with more realistic coronal thermodynamics could reveal interesting changes in outflow shape .",
    "however , the smoothness of the border between outflow and bound corona also means that it is ill - marked . indeed , the rise of the mass outflow rate with radius may be an indication that entrainment plays a significant role in mass entry at large radius , further blurring this edge .    to quantify the collimation , we plot in figure  [ fig : collimation ] the opening angle of the jet obtained by locating the angular boundary between the bound and unbound flow as a function of radius .",
    "as the figure shows , the higher the spin , the more narrow the jet initially , although all of the jets collimate out to around @xmath163@xmath164 . beyond that point ,",
    "the opening angle remains constant or increases very slightly toward the outer boundary of the simulation domain .",
    "the spin - dependence of the opening angle at small radii is most likely due to the fact that the stable disk extends farther inward with increasing spin .",
    "where there is stable disk in the equatorial plane , it is easier to support a high - pressure corona .",
    "in this paper we have examined the unbound axial outflows ( jets ) that develop within grmhd accretion simulations .",
    "what is noteworthy in these models is that the jets develop as a natural result of the accretion process , rather than as a direct consequence of conditions imposed on the simulation .",
    "the jets have two major components : a matter - dominated outflow that moves at a modest velocity ( @xmath165 ) along the centrifugal barrier surrounding an evacuated axial funnel , and a highly - relativistic poynting flux dominated jet within the funnel . the funnel wall jet is accelerated and collimated by magnetic and gas pressure forces in the inner torus and the surrounding corona .",
    "the poynting flux jet results from the formation of a large scale radial magnetic field within the funnel .",
    "this field is spun by the rotating spacetime of the black hole , hence the energy for this jet component comes not directly from accretion but from the black hole s rotation , although the field mediating this energy extraction is a product of accretion .",
    "the energies in both components of the jet are a function of black hole spin ; greater spins yield greater energy",
    ". the total jet power can be a significant fraction of the accretion energy estimated by the product of the mass accretion rate and the specific binding energy of the last stable orbit .",
    "we next consider the broader implications of these results within the context of several of the standard theoretical categories for jets , namely jet acceleration , power , collimation , and the blandford - znajek mechanism .",
    "it has been expected for many years ( since blandford & znajek 1977 ) , that within the axial funnel the spacetime rotation enforced by spinning black holes can drive a significant electromagnetic outflow . our results are clearly in line with that expectation .",
    "the outflow - generation process within the accretion flow itself that has for many years received the greatest attention has been magnetocentrifugal acceleration , such as envisioned in the model of blandford & payne ( 1981 ) , but this mechanism does not appear to be important here .    on the other hand , the main driving force we identify for the funnel wall jet  a high - pressure corona squeezing material against an inner centrifugal wall  has received very little attention in the past . in consequence of this compression , the pressure at the base of the matter outflow is kept high enough to create an outward radial pressure gradient that provides the momentum for the outflow .",
    "it is also worth commenting that these forces act over a substantial radial range , from a few gravitational radii out to many tens .      to measure the relative power in the unbound outflow ,",
    "we have compared the jet energy flux with the mass accretion rate into the hole over the last 70% of the simulation .",
    "the simulation has no radiative losses , so we can not say what the radiative efficiency of the accretion disk would be .",
    "the novikov - thorne efficiency provides a convenient standard of comparison .",
    "this nominal efficiency corresponds to the binding energy of the innermost stable circular orbit , although the actual radiative efficiency could well be different because of , for example , magnetic torques in the plunging region ( krolik 1999 ; gammie 1999 ) , or heat advection into the hole . judged by this measure , the energy carried off in the outflow is considerable . in two cases ( @xmath4 and 0.99 ) ,",
    "the electromagnetic power at @xmath72 is , by itself , comparable to the novikov - thorne prediction of radiated power . in the other high spin cases , it is about a quarter of the novikov - thorne number .",
    "one should remember , however , that energy can be ( and often is ) exchanged between the fields and the matter , so these measures of the electromagnetic power in the outflow are quantitatively accurate _ only _ at the fiducial location where they are measured . because the rate of energy loss in the matter outflow is usually a few times as great as the electromagnetic contribution",
    ", the total is typically comparable to the classical prediction of radiated power .",
    "another way to gain a feel for the magnitude of the electromagnetic power in the outflow is via dimensional analysis .",
    "the poynting flux at the inner boundary is @xmath166 ( cf .",
    "[ eqn : bzpoynting ] ) ; but what determines the magnetic field strength ?",
    "indeed , this has been the key question examined by such works as ghosh & abramowicz ( 1997 ) and livio , ogilvie , & pringle ( 1999 ) .",
    "these authors argued that the strength of the field responsible for a blandford - znajek process must be set by the fields in the accretion flow , and this may limit the total jet power .    at radii in the disk",
    "well beyond the marginally stable region , angular momentum conservation ensures that @xmath167 if magnetic torques are the primary agent of accretion , while the competition between orbital shear and other stresses tends to make @xmath168 . in these simulations , in which @xmath169 is common to all , but",
    "the black hole spin varies , if we wish to analyze the spin - dependence of the poynting flux near the event horizon , it makes sense to examine the ratio of the magnetic field intensity to the mass accretion rate at that location .",
    "we find that the time- and surface area - averaged ratio @xmath170 grows rapidly with increasing black hole spin , very nearly @xmath171 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bsqeff ] ) .",
    "some of this growth is attributable to mere compression , as the event horizon shrinks as the spin rate rises .",
    "however , the dependence is much stronger than anything simple geometry could explain .",
    "it appears that the strong frame - dragging associated with extreme kerr spacetimes leads to substantial field amplification as well .",
    "the rapid growth in electromagnetic power output with faster black hole rotation is predominantly due to this effect .",
    "one of the key issues in jet formation and propagation is the degree to which the jets are collimated .",
    "of course , jets are observed on far larger scales than we are modeling in these simulations , but the degree of collimation seen here is nevertheless of some interest . generally speaking ,",
    "whatever collimation there is occurs in the inner regions of the flow , where the inner disk and hot corona provide confinement . relatively close to the black hole ( @xmath172 ) , the boundary between the magnetically - dominated poynting flux jet and the funnel wall outflow follows the shape of the centrifugal barrier . at larger distances , however , the matter flows almost straight outward , so that the funnel is nearly conical , while the contours of constant effective potential gradually move toward smaller polar angle ( fig .",
    "[ fig : momflux ] ) .",
    "the precise shape and collimation of the jet is somewhat uncertain because the outer boundary of the funnel - wall , matter - dominated funnel wall outflow is somewhat indistinct .",
    "we see a smooth transition as a function of polar angle between mildly relativistic outflowing unbound matter and slightly slower , but bound , coronal matter . on the other hand ,",
    "the boundary between the low - density magnetically - dominated funnel interior and the higher - density funnel - wall outflow is sharp and clear .",
    "it is possible that magnetic forces might provide additional collimation on larger scales , but this remains to be seen in future simulations .      in the astrophysical literature , the general idea that energy can be conveyed from rotating black holes to the outside world via magnetic connections",
    "is often dubbed the  blandford - znajek mechanism \" because they were the first to discuss a specific version of this process . in our simulations ,",
    "when all is said and done , the funnel interior is dominated by a magnetic field that would be purely radial but for the rotation created by its connection to the black hole s ergosphere .",
    "thus , any toroidal field in the funnel , and consequently any poynting flux , is due entirely to general relativistic dynamics peculiar to spinning black holes .",
    "in other words , the outward poynting flux must be due to a process that could fit under the general rubric of  blandford - znajek \" .",
    "on the other hand , we also find specific differences from the classical blandford - znajek model , specifically the particular idealized picture presented in their original paper ( blandford & znajek 1977 ) .",
    "for example , although the funnel region is magnetically - dominated , it is _ not _ in general in a state of force - free equilibrium . indeed , the very large fluctuations that continually occur in the outflow show that it is never in any state of equilibrium , force - free or otherwise .",
    "in addition , as originally shown in phinney ( 1983 ) , the collapse of all wave speeds to @xmath173 in the exact force - free limit means that to understand the dynamics properly requires retention of a finite inertia .",
    "moreover , whereas in the classical blandford - znajek model there was zero accretion ( the only function of nearby orbiting matter is to support the currents sustaining the magnetic field ) , in our picture the electromagnetic luminosity in the outflow takes place entirely as a byproduct of accretion . in the classical model the magnetic field was a relic of plasma inflow that took place in the distant past ; because there was no continuing accretion , the energy output could be attributed unambiguously to the black hole s rotation . in our simulation ,",
    "the magnetic field is a direct result of on - going accretion .",
    "while the proximate energy source for the jet is the black hole s rotation , accretion replenishes both the black hole s mass and angular momentum , and whether the rotational energy of the black hole actually decreases depends on details such as the radiative efficiency and , possibly , the accretion of photons ( krolik 2001 ; cf .",
    "thorne 1974 ) . in our @xmath82 simulation ,",
    "the net angular momentum accreted is so small that , for reasonable values of the radiative efficiency , the system is very near the edge of an actual decrease in rotational kinetic energy .",
    "even if the black hole s rotational energy does not decrease , there can nevertheless be a significant increase in the efficiency of accretion .",
    "we find that for rapidly rotating black holes the total power in the poynting flux jet can be comparable to the nominal accretion power .",
    "a number of other numerical studies of the generic blandford - znajek mechanism have been carried out recently .",
    "one type of simulation has been devoted to examining the idealized problem of a rotating black hole embedded in thin plasma containing a specified external magnetic field ( koide 2003 ; semenov et al .",
    "2004 ; komissarov 2005 ) .",
    "these simulations focus on points of basic principle , such as the extent to which accretion of either matter or electromagnetic fields with negative energy - at - infinity plays a role .",
    "komissarov ( 2005 ) particularly notes that plasma effects within the ergosphere were significant early on in his simulation while the initial plasma is accreting into the hole , but that the long - term steady state mechanism resembles closely the classic blandford - znajek model .",
    "the simulations of mckinney & gammie ( 2004 ) were more similar in their focus to ours , as they too were principally concerned with the connection between continuing accretion and the electromagnetic power output of black holes .",
    "for this reason , their ( axi - symmetric ) simulations employed initial conditions resembling ours ( isolated initial gas torus containing field loops ) .",
    "they found good agreement with several aspects of the classical blandford - znajek model for slowly rotating holes , but growing differences as the spin of the hole increases and the field becomes less monopolar .",
    "that this should be so is not too surprising , as the specific predictions of the blandford - znajek model were developed on the basis of a perturbation expansion in @xmath0 . in regard to the global energy and angular momentum budgets , mckinney & gammmie s results qualitatively resemble ours .",
    "they also saw that as the hole loses energy and angular momentum electromagnetically , its total mass and angular momentum are replenished by accretion .",
    "likewise , they , too , found that the overall efficiency ( energy released to infinity per rest - mass accreted ) can be significantly enhanced by the energy carried off in the jet .",
    "mckinney ( 2005 ) expanded upon these results and proposed an analytic fitting function for the electromagnetic efficiency of the jet as a function of black hole rotation rate , suggesting that this efficiency scales @xmath174 , where @xmath175 is the rotation rate of the black hole . if the poynting flux were due simply to rotation of a magnetic dipole whose magnitude is independent of black hole rotation but @xmath176 , the efficiency would , of course , increase @xmath177 .",
    "the slightly faster dependence mckinney ( 2005 ) found suggests either that there is a mixture of a higher multipole component or that the magnitude of the magnetic dipole increases slowly with increasing black hole spin .",
    "the choice of this functional form was motivated by the hope that electromagnetic radiation in this case resembled classical dipole radiation , in which the luminosity is @xmath178 . whether this applies in the present context depends , of course , on whether dipole field geometry is a reasonable approximation and on whether the mean field strength at the horizon produced by a fixed accretion rate is independent of spin .",
    "unfortunately , for a variety of technical reasons it is difficult to compare quantitatively the results of different numerical simulations . without the inclusion of additional physics in the basic equations",
    ", there is no absolute density scale in the gas .",
    "although efficiencies are well - defined ( ratios of energies to masses within the simulation ) , one can not define an absolute accretion rate .",
    "even the comparison of efficiencies from one type of simulation to another poses problems .",
    "for example , two dimensional simulations tend to over - emphasize axisymmetric mri modes . as a result , they tend to have large accretion rates early on , followed by a rapid decline as the magnetic field and accompanying turbulence die out , as expected from the anti - dynamo theorem .",
    "thus , when computing the efficiency in a two dimensional simulation simulation , one must be careful about choosing an appropriate interval over which to average the accretion rate .",
    "a second problem is that , as discussed previously , energy can be exchanged between the electromagnetic and matter components of the outflow , so the purely electromagnetic power is a function of radius . to cross - compare different simulations , it is therefore important to use the same fiducial distance for evaluating the electromagnetic power .",
    "lastly , jet properties may depend on the vertical thickness of the accretion disk , a parameter determined by the initial temperature of the disk and the treatment of the energy equation in the simulation . the gross accretion rate in general scales @xmath179 , but we do not know how the magnetic field in the vicinity of the black hole scales with disk temperature .",
    "further simulational work will be required to determine such effects , although because the strength of the axial funnel field is determined by the accretion flow , it is a reasonable expectation that the jet power might scale with the accretion rate ( ghosh & abramowicz 1997 ) .    keeping these _ caveats _ in mind",
    ", we can compare our electromagnetic efficiency in the jet with the scaling relation proposed by mckinney ( 2005 ) by modifying his relation to use the rotation rate of our inner grid radius instead of the rotation rate of the horizon .",
    "the quantitative match between our data and mckinney s formula is not particularly good , although qualitatively we , too , see a strong increase in efficiency as black hole spin increases .",
    "our results are better described by the simple formula @xmath180 a form that describes both the high and lower spin models .",
    "of course , without any clear theory to predict the strength of the magnetic field on the event horizon relative to the mass accretion rate as a function of black hole rotation rate , one can not expect to find a general formula for total jet power",
    ".    finally , we would like to close this paper by pointing out that , although the blandford - znajek mechanism was originally thought of as a scheme for powering jets , outflows are not the only place where electromagnetic power from the black hole can go . in this paper",
    "we have concentrated on jet properties .",
    "however , preliminary analysis of the accretion flow in these simulations indicates that the poynting flux and electromagnetic angular momentum flux from the black hole into the disk can be comparable to those within the outflow .",

    "<S> we compute a series of three - dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accretion flows in the kerr metric to investigate the properties of the unbound outflows that result . </S>",
    "<S> the overall strength of these outflows increases sharply with increasing black hole rotation rate , but a number of generic features are found in all cases . </S>",
    "<S> the mass in the outflow is concentrated in a hollow cone whose opening angle is largely determined by the effective potential for matter orbiting with angular momentum comparable to that of the innermost stable circular orbit . the dominant force accelerating the matter outward comes from the pressure of the accretion disk s corona . </S>",
    "<S> the principal element that shapes the outflow is therefore the centrifugal barrier preventing accreting matter from coming close to the rotation axis . inside the centrifugal barrier , </S>",
    "<S> the cone contains very little matter and is dominated by electromagnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic fieldlines inside the cone rotate at a rate tied closely to the rotation of the black hole , even when the black hole spins in a sense opposite to the rotation of the accretion flow . </S>",
    "<S> these fields carry an outward - going poynting flux whose immediate energy source is the rotating spacetime of the kerr black hole . when the spin parameter @xmath0 of the black hole exceeds @xmath1 , the energy carried to infinity by these outflows can be comparable to the nominal radiative efficiency predicted in the novikov - thorne model . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the expelled angular momentum can be comparable to that accreted by the black hole . </S>",
    "<S> both the inner electromagnetic part and the outer matter part can contribute in significant fashion to the energy and angular momentum of the outflow . </S>"
