    "in experiments , jets are obtained from hadronic momenta which are reconstructed from tracks and energy depositions in the detectors . in theory ,",
    "those jets are modelled by clustering the partonic final states one usually ends up with in calculations : @xmath1 in what follows we will refer to all observed ( jet-)momenta @xmath2 from a collision @xmath3 as ` jet event ' .",
    "a weight for this event can be defined by interpreting the differential cross section as a probabilty density to measure a specific event : @xmath4 with a differential jet cross section , one can calculate more inclusive observables , generate unweighted events according to @xmath5 or use it in likelihood analysis methods like the matrix element method .",
    "the mem @xcite can be used to extract model parameters @xmath6 from data by maximizing a likelihood ( e.g. for a given set of jet events @xmath7 )    @xmath8 which is proportional to the differential cross section .",
    "maximizing with respect to @xmath6 yields an estimator for @xmath9 : @xmath10 since all information in the event is used in the matrix element , this method is believed to provide the most efficient estimator .",
    "pioneered at the tevatron ( e.g. @xcite ) , the mem is widely used today ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "automation of the mem has been studied in @xcite . however",
    ", one caveat of the above formulation is its limitation to lo accuracy .",
    "a first attempt towards nlo has been made in @xcite studying the effect of qcd radiation . in @xcite , the hard matrix element and a parton shower",
    "is used to discriminate signal _ versus _ background .",
    "an nlo extension for events with uncolored final states has already been presented in @xcite .",
    "the hadronic production of jets is investigated in @xcite .",
    "nlo and lo jets are mapped by means of a boost along the beam axis to balance the transverse momentum .      when writing an ansatz for the likelihood at nlo ( for a given set of events with @xmath11 jets ) as a sum of the born and virtual ( b+v ) part and the real ( r ) part ( with unresolved additional radiation ) @xmath12 one faces three problems :    1 .",
    "since both contributions are separately infrared ( ir ) divergent , a point - wise cancellation within phase space must be ensured .",
    "so both contributions have to be evaluated for the same jet momenta .",
    "2 .   in the real contribution ,",
    "@xmath13 partons are clustered to @xmath11 jets : @xmath14 .",
    "this introduces @xmath15-functions @xmath16 in the phase space integration which render any numerical integration useless .",
    "if the real phase space factorizes in terms of an @xmath11-jet phase space and the unresolved configurations : @xmath17 , these @xmath15-functions will be fulfilled by construction : @xmath18 this factorisation serves as an inversion of the jet algorithm since @xmath19 generates only partonic configurations that result in the given jet event .",
    "3 .   in the born and virtual contribution ,",
    "@xmath11 partons form @xmath11 jets : @xmath20 .",
    "to evaluate the born and virtual matrix elements for the jet momenta ( @xmath21 ) , the clustered jets have to be on - shell : @xmath22 and respect momentum conservation : @xmath23 at the same time .",
    "this is not possible with @xmath24 clustering prescriptions .",
    "employing instead @xmath25 clustering prescriptions ( inspired by the catani - seymour dipole subtraction method @xcite ) allows to meet these requirements enabling the cancellation of the ir divergences and factorization of the real phase space .",
    "using this modified jet algorithm allows to define an event weight ( differential jet cross section ) at nlo accuracy @xmath26 the mutual cancellation of the ir divergencies has to be carried out by a suitable subtraction method ( e.g. phase space slicing @xcite ) .",
    "to valididate our approach , we reproduce jet distributions calculated with an conventional parton level monte - carlo generator ( mc ) using the @xmath27 jet algorithm . two sample processes which cover all essential aspects are studied : drell  yan @xmath28 ( initial state radiation ) and top - quark pair production at a lepton collider @xmath29 ( final state radiation with massive particles ) . for calculational details ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we veto on additional jet emission since we are only interested in the case when there is a recombination in the real contribution .          as an example fig .",
    "[ fig : psvaldy ] shows the invariant mass distribution of the lepton pair from drell  yan obtained with the parton level mc ( blue solid ) and the factorized jet phase space as outlined above ( red dashed ) .",
    "the lower part of the plot shows the difference in terms of the statistical error .",
    "we find perfect agreement between the two distributions .",
    "comparisons of other observables , also for top - quark pair production yield similar conclusions and are presented in @xcite .          with the jet event weight at nlo",
    ", we can generate unweighted jet events at nlo using a simple acceptance / rejection algorithm .",
    "as an example , fig .",
    "[ fig : uwevaltt ] shows histogrammed @xmath30 of these events ( red dashed ) .",
    "again we find perfect agreement when comparing with the distribution obtained from the conventional parton level mc ( blue solid ) .",
    "comparisons of the other observables yield similar conclusions ( see @xcite ) .      treating the sample of unweighted jet events which were generated with an input value of the top - quark mass @xmath31 gev as a toy experiment , where jet angles @xmath32 were measured",
    ", we can apply the mem at nlo to the sample of nlo @xmath33 events @xmath34 fig .",
    "[ fig : mem ] shows the negative logarithm of the likelihood ( ` log - likelihood ' ) as a function of @xmath35 at born ( solid / blue ) and nlo ( dashed / red ) accuracy .",
    "the estimator @xmath36 is extracted by a fit ( dotted lines ) .",
    "extracting @xmath37 from the nlo events with the nlo likelihood perfectly reproduces @xmath38 , while the extraction with the born likelihood yields a value for @xmath39 which differs from @xmath38 by @xmath40 gev .",
    "it is no surprise that using the wrong likelihood might result in a biased estimator .",
    "however , the size of the effect is remarkable , considering that nlo corrections to distributions for this process only amount to a few percent .",
    "finally , it should be noted that the renormalization scheme is well - defined in the mem at nlo , allowing a less ambigious interpretation of the extracted parameters . for more details on mem at nlo ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite ."
