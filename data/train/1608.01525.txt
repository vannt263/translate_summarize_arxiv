    "two polarization - entangled photons can be generated in a standard parametric down - conversion ( pdc ) experiment .",
    "the entanglement can be accessed because the photons can be distinguished by their momentum  a photon moving left and the one moving right .",
    "interestingly , if the two pdc photons go through polarizing beam splitters and the h - polarized one is sent to alice , whereas the v - polarized one is sent to bob , the party can still detect entanglement , but this time it occurs in the momentum degree of freedom .",
    "this phenomenon is known as duality in entanglement and does not occur in case of distinguishable particles .",
    "duality in entanglement provides an interaction - free test of particle indistinguishability @xcite and can be observed in various physical implementations @xcite .",
    "the idea of the test relies on the fact that for distinguishable particles superselection rules ( ssr ) @xcite restrict the set of all the possible measurements . as a result",
    ", the entanglement can not be observed after the swap of labels .",
    "however , such a rule can be lifted by the introduction of a proper additional state , called a reference frame @xcite . in this work",
    "we investigate its impact on the duality of entanglement",
    ".    it is well know that in the first quantization picture the symmetrization / anti - symmetrization of the wave function can be sometimes considered as entanglement which can not be operationally accessed @xcite",
    ". nevertheless , due to this fact fermionic and bosonic properties can be simulated with distinguishable particles if one prepares them in a proper symmetric or anti - symmetric state .",
    "such a preparation requires entanglement consumption , which in this case can be considered as a resource to simulate identicality of particles .",
    "however , it is not obvious that every bosonic / fermionic property can be simulated only by symmetrization / anti - symmetrization .",
    "some properties may also be simulated with alternative resources .    here , we ask what alternative resources contained in reference frames can be used to simulate duality in entanglement .",
    "in particular , we identify the minimal conditions needed for such a reference frame to enable distinguishable particles to exhibit the duality .",
    "the result pinpoints the aspects of indistingiushability captured by the entanglement duality .",
    "this highlights issues that should be considered while preparing the duality - based tests of identicity of particles .",
    "moreover , it contributes to a formulation of a resource theory of indistinguishability .",
    "we follow ref . @xcite and consider two pdc photons @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the operator that creates a photon with polarization @xmath4 and momentum @xmath5 .",
    "the above state is clearly entangled if we distinguish particles by their momentum @xmath6 ( for details see @xcite ) .    for a system of distinguishable particles we use different creation operators @xmath7",
    "now the entanglement depends on the choice of indexing .",
    "as momentum is consistent with the type of the particle , the state @xmath8 or @xmath9 , but in order to detect entanglement one also needs to measure some other complementary states , say @xmath10 .",
    "however , the second measurement can only be done if @xmath11 .",
    "this follows from ssr which prohibit states superposing different particle types from being the eigenstates of quantum observables and the fact that @xmath12 is associated with the particle @xmath13 and @xmath9 with the particle @xmath14 .",
    "because of the distinguishability of particles , there is no duality in entanglement for this system .    in the first quantization picture",
    "the state ( [ eq : bose creation ] ) can be written as @xmath15 ) would be operationally hyper - entangled and it would pass the indistinguishability test based on duality in entanglement . in the second quantization picture it is of the form",
    "@xmath16 one can interpret this in the following way  by adding entanglement to the system the state ( [ eq : bose creation2 ] ) becomes symmetric and behaves like a state of indistinguishable particles .",
    "now , we ask if the state ( [ eq : bose creation2 ] ) can pass the duality test without symmetrization .",
    "this is possible if the measurements are performed on an extended system @xmath17 . here",
    ", @xmath18 is the state of the original system and @xmath19 is the state of an ancilla , which is commonly known as a reference frame .",
    "to illustrate the idea we consider @xmath20 . this way the extended system is in the state @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and the tensor product denotes the fact that each copy of the system occupies a different mode .    for convenience we set @xmath23 and @xmath24 and use the convention that the first state in the product is @xmath25-polarized and the second @xmath24-polarized .",
    "we stress that this is just a rewriting and the above state is still operationally mixed due to the underlying ssr , i.e. , observing the state @xmath26 is only possible if @xmath27 .",
    "however , if we add its copy we obtain @xmath28 means that alice has a state @xmath29 and bob has @xmath30 .",
    "the state ( [ 2copies ] ) consists of the operationally mixed and entangled parts .",
    "this is because @xmath31 is only possible if @xmath27 , but @xmath32 is allowed for any @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( up to the normalisation constraint @xmath35 ) .    in order to verify the entanglement in the above state we consider the peres - horodecki criterion @xcite , i.e. , the negativity of the partially transposed density matrix .",
    "however , the matrix to which we apply this condition needs to be modified .",
    "because some coherences are unobservable due to the ssr , they need to be excluded from the effective density matrix ( we locally apply the so - called _ twirling _ operation @xcite ) @xmath36 the first four terms are diagonal , whereas the last two correspond to observable coherencies and are responsible for the entanglement . after applying a partial transposition",
    "we obtain @xmath37 this is a block diagonal matrix and the last block , corresponding to the last two terms , has eigenvalues @xmath38 .",
    "this confirms that the state is entangled .",
    "the example shows an idea of bypassing ssr with an additional subsystem .",
    "however , it is not clear that the observable entanglement in the effective state originates from the original subsystem , since the additional one is also entangled @xcite .",
    "we will resolve this issue in the next section .",
    "let us consider a reference frame in a werner state @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 is the same as in ( [ simplestate ] ) and the identity is expressed in terms of states ( [ n1 ] ) and ( [ n2 ] ) @xmath42 the state ( [ sr ] ) is separable for @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the total state of the system is @xmath44 coherencies in the first term are unobservable due to the ssr , therefore this part of the state is effectively diagonal .",
    "the second term is the same as in the example from the previous section .    in order to confirm the entanglement in the above state",
    "we apply once again the peres - horodecki criterion .",
    "the effective partially transposed density matrix is block diagonal and the only relevant block is a @xmath45 submatrix , which contains an off - diagonal term and is proportional to the one considered before @xmath46 its eigenvalues are @xmath47 and we see that the total state @xmath48 is entangled for any value of @xmath49 . in particular , if @xmath50 we can confirm entanglement in momentum and at the same time we know that the state of the reference frame ( [ sr ] ) is separable .",
    "therefore , the entanglement comes solely from the original state and the reference frame is only used to activate it .",
    "the above examples show that it is not necessary that the reference frame is entangled , but rather that it contains non - zero off - diagonal terms . in addition",
    ", the reference frame has two important additional features . just like in the case of particle number ssr , although the state @xmath19 is separable , it can not be prepared locally @xcite .",
    "this is because the local preparation would require a violation of local ssr .",
    "in addition , although particles @xmath13 and @xmath14 in the original system are different , preparation of a reference frame capable of activating the dual entanglement requires the same type of particles ( either bosons or fermions ) .",
    "if the reference frame consisted of other particles , say @xmath51 and @xmath52 , one would not be able to bypass the ssr .",
    "one may ask what type of physical property of the reference frame ( what type of a resource ) is responsible for the activation of the dual form of entanglement . to answer this question we first recall some previous results on nonclassical correlations in the presence of ssr .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that in the presence of a particle number ssr in order to violate bell inequality with the entanglement contained solely in the original system one needs a reference frame with a non - zero _ superselection - induced variance _ ( siv ) @xcite .",
    "siv is a resource that arises in bipartite systems which are subject to the particle number ssr .",
    "it corresponds to a local uncertainty of the particle number , despite the fact that the global particle number is fixed .",
    "it is defined as the variance of the local particle number @xmath53 where the factor of four is due to normalisation @xcite . for mixed states",
    "one can introduce siv of formation , which is analogous to the entanglement of formation ( eof ) @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 represents a probability distribution over pure states @xmath56 that create the mixed state @xmath57 .",
    "however , contrary to eof , the minimization is not over all possible pure states , but only over those obeying ssr .",
    "in our case the ssr corresponds to a lack of a superposition between different particle types .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that every pure state needs to have a well defined global number of particles @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "we recall the definitions ( [ n1 ] ) and ( [ n2 ] ) where @xmath58 was associated with particle @xmath13 and @xmath59 was associated with particle @xmath14 .",
    "the ability to activate dual entanglement comes from the off - diagonal terms in the reference frame .",
    "they originate from a superposition @xmath60 which is the only element of the state @xmath19 ( [ sr ] ) for which the local numbers of @xmath13 and @xmath14 are uncertain .",
    "one may therefore associate this uncertainty with the resource that is responsible for the activation of the dual entanglement .",
    "it can be measured by the siv of one type of particle , say particle @xmath13 , which we will denote as siv@xmath61 .",
    "following the result in @xcite we have @xmath62 if we require that @xmath19 is separable , then siv@xmath61 must be less than @xmath63 .    to conclude , we argued that the variance of the local particle number ( siv@xmath61 ) is a resource which can activate dual entanglement in an entangled state of distinguishable particles .",
    "this shows that some properties of indistinguishable particles can be simulated with distinguishable ones without the need of state symmetrization / anti - symmetrization , provided one has an access to a properly engineered reference frame",
    ". it would be interesting to show that other features , that are commonly considered to be typical bosonic or fermionic properties ( such as bunching or anti - bunching @xcite ) , can also be simulated with siv@xmath61 or some different resource other than symmetrization / anti - symmetrization , which in most cases requires entanglement ."
