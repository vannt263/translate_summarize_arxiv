    "excitations of neutron - rich nuclei near drip - line are subjects which are currently investigated extensively .",
    "it is expected that exotic properties such as halo , skin or presence of weakly bound nucleons in neutron - rich nuclei cause new features in excitations .",
    "an example is the soft dipole excitation in light halo nuclei@xcite , typically in @xmath9li and @xmath9be , where significant e1 strength is observed above the very low neutron threshold energy .",
    "this is in contrast to the situation in stable nuclei , where most of the e1 strength concentrates in the high energy region of giant resonances .",
    "recently the soft dipole excitation is observed also in heavier systems up to neutron - rich oxygen isotopes @xmath10o @xcite .",
    "these oxygen isotopes do not exhibit noticeable halo structure@xcite , but on the other hand they contain many valence neutrons .",
    "this suggests that the soft dipole excitation is not always inherent to one- or two - neutron halo , but instead it may be a many - body phenomenon more generally seen in many neutron - rich nuclei near drip - line reaching medium and possibly heavier mass regions .",
    "the degree of collectivity or the nature of correlations responsible for this excitation is one of the central issues which need to be clarified .",
    "indeed different mechanisms have been proposed so far .",
    "one of the simplest mechanisms producing the soft dipole excitation is the one which is associated with uncorrelated excitation of a weakly bound neutron to continuum states . in this case ,",
    "significant e1 strength emerges just above the threshold energy of neutron escaping without resorting to correlations nor collectivity , as it is sometimes called the threshold effect@xcite .",
    "this arises from a large spatial overlap between the extended wave function of a weakly bound single - particle orbit , which is occupied by a neutron in the ground state , and that of low energy continuum orbits , to which the neutron is excited .",
    "major aspects of the soft dipole excitation observed in one - neutron halo systems , e.g. @xmath9be , fit rather well with this uncorrelated excitation picture@xcite .",
    "however , when more than one neutrons participate in the excitation , correlation between neutrons plays a role , and different mechanisms of the soft dipole excitation can be expected . in the case of the two - neutron halo nucleus @xmath9li ,",
    "the pairing correlation among halo neutrons plays a decisive role for the binding and formation of the halo @xcite .",
    "it is suggested that the two halo neutrons in the ground state display an attractive correlation in such a way that they are spatially localized with respect to their relative distance , in a range smaller than the size of the nuclear matter radius@xcite .",
    "the pairing correlation of this type or the di - neutron correlation in short is predicted to cause a strong enhancement on the soft dipole excitation in the two - neutron halo nucleus @xcite , or even to form a collective vibrational motion of the correlated halo neutrons against the rest of the system@xcite .",
    "experimentally signatures of possible di - neutron correlation in the soft dipole excitation are obtained in @xmath9li@xcite , but strong neutron - neutron correlations are not probed in other experiments@xcite .",
    "the soft dipole excitation in medium mass nuclei has also been investigated theoretically , but with different viewpoints and results .",
    "the random phase approximation ( rpa ) calculations based on the hartree - fock models or the relativistic mean - field model predict that the soft dipole excitations has a character of uncorrelated neutron excitation carrying very little collectivity in the neutron - rich oxygen isotopes @xcite .",
    "note however that these rpa models do not take into account the pair correlations among neutrons .",
    "the shell model calculation@xcite reproduces rather well with the experimental soft dipole strength in oxygen isotopes , but continuum effects are not included .",
    "recently quasiparticle rpa ( qrpa ) calculations that include explicitly the neutron pairing corrections have been performed@xcite .",
    "most recent ones predict that the neutron pair correlation has a sizable effect on e1 strength of the soft dipole excitation in the medium mass region@xcite .",
    "this suggests that the neutron pair correlation is an important key to clarify the character of the soft dipole excitation in medium mass and heavier systems .    in the present paper ,",
    "we analyze in detail pair correlation effects in the medium mass region with @xmath11 , taking proton ( semi-)magic oxygen , calcium and nickel isotopes as representative examples . motivated by the debate on the light two - neutron halo nuclei",
    ", we pay special attention to possibilities of the di - neutron correlation in these medium mass nuclei .",
    "we will conclude that some features of the di - neutron correlation are indeed present rather generally in the ground state of the medium mass nuclei .",
    "furthermore the di - neutron correlation brings about a characteristic and strong influence also on the soft dipole excitation .",
    "our analysis is based on the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) method in the coordinate - space representation for description of the ground state , and the continuum quasiparticle random phase approximation ( the continuum qrpa ) for the excitations .",
    "the coordinate - space hfb theory@xcite is beneficial for description of nuclei with pair correlations near drip - line in medium and heavier mass regions since it extends the general hfb theory@xcite in such a way that contributions of weakly - bound and continuum orbits to the pair correlation is precisely treated on the same footing with all other nucleons through an explicit account of the coordinate - dependence of the pair potential and the quasiparticle wave functions .",
    "it is possible then to describe the excitations by generalizing the coordinate - space hfb to a time - dependent problem , i.e. by considering a linear response of the system against the external perturbation .",
    "we have formulated recently a new qrpa method@xcite along this line to describe excitations embedded in the continuum region above the threshold energies of nucleon escaping , which is an essential feature of nuclei near drip - line .",
    "this continuum qrpa has several distinctive features , compared to the continuum rpa@xcite which neglects the pair correlation , and to the conventional qrpa neglecting continuum effects .",
    "one of the most distinguished aspects is that it enables us to include correlations among continuum two - quasiparticle configurations corresponding to two - neutron escaping as well as to one - neutron escaping . as the model formulation is fully microscopic in treating all the nucleon degrees of freedom democratically , the di - neutron correlation , if present ,",
    "emerges only as a consequence of the microscopic description . in order to probe the di - neutron behaviors in the ground state and in the soft dipole excitation we look into the two - body correlation density and the pair transition densities , which provide information on pair motion of neutrons .",
    "numerical calculations are performed for even - even neutron - rich oxygen , calcium and nickel isotopes @xmath0o , @xmath1ca and @xmath2ni near drip - line and for some more stable isotopes for comparison . in section [ dineutron - in - gs ]",
    ", we analyze the di - neutron correlation in the hfb ground state . in section [ dineutron - in - softdipole ] , analysis of the soft dipole excitations using the continuum qrpa method is presented .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section [ concl ] .",
    "we do not discuss in the present paper the low - lying dipole strength in stable nuclei with neutron excess , called pygmy dipole resonance @xcite since the situations are different from those in near - drip - line nuclei on which we put focus in the present paper .",
    "preliminary report of the present work is seen in ref.@xcite .",
    "wave functions of weakly bound neutrons in nuclei close to drip - line extend largely to the outside of nuclear surface due to the quantum mechanical penetration .",
    "since associated neutron density is very low , the pair correlations in internal , surface , and external regions may be different .",
    "the coordinate - space hartree - fock - bogoliubov theory@xcite enables us to deal with this non - uniformity by utilizing an explicit coordinate representation for the bogoliubov quasiparticles , which are the fundamental modes of the single - particle motion under the influence of pairing correlation . in this scheme",
    "the quasiparticles are able to have both particle and hole characters simultaneously , and accordingly they are expressed by the two - component wave functions @xmath12 where @xmath13,and @xmath14 represent spin and isospin .",
    "the quasiparticle states are determined by the hfb equation @xmath15 with @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the quasiparticle energy .",
    "the hfb selfconsistent mean - field hamiltonian @xmath18 consists of not only the particle - hole part @xmath19 including the kinetic energy term , the hartree - fock mean - field and the fermi energy @xmath20 , but also the particle - particle part @xmath21 originating from the pair correlation .",
    "the mean - field hamiltonian , @xmath22 and @xmath21 , are expressed in terms of the normal density matrix @xmath23 , the pair density matrix @xmath24 and the effective nuclear force .",
    "we do not need the explicit form of the correlated hfb ground state @xmath25 since ground state expectation values of various physical quantities can be evaluated with use of the wick s theorem for the quasiparticle annihilation and creation operators @xmath26 and @xmath27 satisfying the vacuum condition @xmath28 , and with use of their relation to the nucleon annihilation and creation operators given by @xmath29    in the present work , we derive the particle - particle mean - field @xmath21 by using the selfconsistent hfb scheme . as the effective nuclear force",
    "responsible for the particle - particle part @xmath21 , called shortly the effective pairing force below , we adopt the density dependent delta interaction @xcite @xmath30 with this choice , the particle - particle part @xmath21 becomes a local pair potential @xmath31 expressed with the diagonal pair density @xmath32 .",
    "the parameter @xmath33 together with the total density @xmath34 in eq.([ddpair ] ) controls the density dependence of the effective pairing force .",
    "there is no established knowledge on the density dependence of the pairing force , being under current investigations@xcite . in the following analysis , we consider three cases : 1 ) the pairing with strong density dependence ( or the surface pairing force in short ) , for which the parameter @xmath33 is set to the central total density @xmath35 @xmath36 , 2 ) the density independent pairing force with the choice of @xmath37 ( the volume pairing force ) , and 3 ) the case of an intermediate density dependence with @xmath38 @xmath36 ( the mixed pairing force ) .",
    "since a recent analysis suggests that the mixed pairing reproduces better the odd - even mass difference in many isotopic chains@xcite , we adopt the mixed pairing as a reference choice .",
    "the surface and volume pairing forces are employed to examine sensitivity to the density dependence .    concerning the particle - hole part @xmath22 of the hfb hamiltonian",
    ", we replace it by a spherical woods - saxon potential model in the present work for the simplicity of numerical calculation .",
    "the use of the woods - saxon model makes the continuum qrpa calculation feasible . to our knowledge",
    ", there is so far no fully selfconsistent continuum qrpa calculation that utilizes the full hfb hamiltonian derived from an effective interaction .",
    "the parameters of the woods - saxon model follow ref.@xcite , which gives a reasonable description of the giant dipole excitation in doubly shell - closed stable nuclei , such as @xmath39o and @xmath40ca .",
    "neutron single - particle orbits near the fermi energy are shown in fig.[spenergy ] for representative isotopes .    assuming the spherical symmetry , we solve the hfb equation ( [ grhfb ] ) in the radial coordinate for each partial wave . here",
    "we adopt the radial mesh size @xmath41 fm , and the box size @xmath42 fm , following ref.@xcite .",
    "a cut - off quasiparticle energy @xmath43 mev and the angular momentum cut - off @xmath44 are used in summing up contributions of quasiparticle states when we evaluate the density matrices and associated quantities . note that we include continuum quasiparticle states with @xmath45 which lie above the threshold energy @xmath46 .",
    "these continuum states , whose upper component @xmath47 of the quasiparticle wave function extends to the outside of the nucleus without decaying , contribute to the correlated hfb ground state . to achieve the selfconsistency between the quasiparticle wave functions and the hfb mean - field hamiltonian",
    "an iteration method@xcite is used .",
    "the force strength parameter @xmath48 in eq.([ddpair ] ) is fixed for each isotope chain so that the calculated neutron average gap @xmath49 @xcite gives an overall agreement with the odd - even mass difference of the three - point formula@xcite , as shown in fig.[gap ] .",
    "a common value @xmath50 mev @xmath51 is adopted in the case of the mixed pairing . note that we here improve the pairing force parameter , compared with our previous calculations@xcite where the conventional systematics @xmath52 mev is fitted to determine @xmath48 .",
    "the value of @xmath53 in the oxygen isotopes is larger by about 40% than the experimental odd - even mass difference ( fig.[gap ] ) . in the following",
    "we shall use a larger value of @xmath48 which corresponds to the value of @xmath53 in order to investigate dependence on the pairing force strength .      in order to analyze spatial behavior of the neutron pair correlation and to search for possible di - neutron aspects ,",
    "we evaluate the two - body correlation density @xmath54 for the calculated ground state . this quantity displays correlation between two neutrons at positions @xmath55 and @xmath56 with spins @xmath57 and @xmath58 . the spin anti - parallel ( spin - singlet ) configuration @xmath59 is responsible for the neutron pairing . in the above definition",
    "we subtract the uncorrelated contribution @xmath60 in order to separate the change originating from the correlation .",
    "the two - body correlation density is also expressed as @xmath61 in terms of off - diagonal parts of the pair and the normal density matrices .",
    "for the spin anti - parallel configuration , the first term of eq.([twobody ] ) gives dominant contribution when the pair correlation is present .",
    "a different behavior is seen for the spin parallel configuration , where the two - body correlation density probes dominantly the pauli repulsion effect , which is brought by the second term . in the following we concentrate on the spin anti - parallel neutron correlation . in displaying this quantity , we fix the position @xmath56 of one spin - down ( @xmath62 ) neutron ( called the reference neutron hereafter ) and plot it as a function of the position @xmath55 of the other spin - up ( @xmath63 ) neutrons .",
    "actual plots are made for the two - body correlation density @xmath64 divided by the neutron density @xmath65 at the position of the reference neutron .",
    "this represents the conditional probability of finding neutrons at position @xmath55 with spin @xmath63 provided that the reference neutron is fixed at @xmath56 with spin @xmath62 .",
    "this normalization removes the trivial radial dependence of the density that falls off exponentially as the reference neutron position moves to the exterior region .",
    "this facilitates comparison among different positions of the reference neutron .",
    "examples of the two - body correlation density are displayed in fig.[cordens ] for nuclei near drip - line @xmath66o , @xmath67ca and @xmath68ni .",
    "the reference neutron is placed at a position @xmath69 along the z - axis , where @xmath70 is fixed the surface radius @xmath71 .",
    "we evaluate @xmath72 by a position of the half central neutron density . to examine dependence on the reference neutron position ,",
    "it is further displaced at an internal ( @xmath73 fm ) and an external ( @xmath74 fm ) positions shifted by @xmath75 fm from the surface .",
    "the external position @xmath76 fm represents the neutron skin region , as the neutron density at this position is about @xmath77 of the central density ( see fig.[density ] ) in these isotopes .",
    "( note that a criterion @xmath78 is sometimes adopted in the literature @xcite to define the neutron skin thickness and to distinguish from a typical neutron halo , which emerges with a lower density @xmath79 . )",
    "it is seen that the correlation density @xmath80 exhibits a large and sharp peak in all the cases shown in fig.[cordens ] .",
    "the peak position almost coincides with the reference neutron position .",
    "the width @xmath81 , evaluated by the full width at half maximum , of the peak of the correlation density is only about 2 fm when the reference neutron is placed at the internal or the surface positions .",
    "this obviously means a strong concentration of the correlation density around the reference neutron as the width @xmath81 is smaller than the nuclear radius or the distance between the reference neutron and the nuclear center . in the region other than the first largest peak , the correlation density displays oscillatory behaviors , but its absolute value is much smaller than the first largest peak .",
    "the observed concentration of the two - body correlation density in the small region around the reference neutron indicates that two neutrons with spin anti - parallel ( spin singlet ) configuration has a large probability to come close at short relative distances @xmath82 fm . it may be possible to regard this feature of the neutron pairing as that of the di - neutron correlation .",
    "it is possible to quantify the extent of the di - neutron correlation by evaluating the first largest peak in the two - body correlation density .",
    "here we note that the first term in eq.([twobody ] ) gives the dominant contribution to the correlation density .",
    "this term expressed in terms of the pair density matrix has a direct relation to the pair correlation .",
    "it is customary to regard the pair density matrix @xmath83 as the wave function of a neutron pair in the correlated hfb ground state . in this sense",
    "the first term @xmath84 with the opposite spins represents the probability distribution of a spin - singlet neutron pair . using this quantity and normalizing , we can define a relative probability @xmath85 for the spin - up neutron to exist within a distance @xmath86 from the spin - down reference neutron .",
    "the quantity @xmath87 with a suitable value of @xmath86 measures the probability for the correlated neutron pair to form the di - neutron peak .",
    "we call it the di - neutron probability in the following . calculated examples of the di - neutron probability are listed in table [ dineutronprob ] .",
    "we adopt @xmath88 fm for the internal and the surface cases , while for the external case @xmath89 fm is chosen to cover the large peak near the reference neutron ( cf .",
    "figs.[cordens ] , [ cordenslcut ] and [ cordensecut ] ) .",
    "the di - neutron probability amounts to 30 - 60% . as a reference",
    ", we compare with an estimate which would be obtained if the neutron pair probability @xmath90 distributed uniformly in the whole nuclear volume .",
    "this uniform limit , which we evaluate by replacing @xmath90 with the neutron density @xmath91 , gives @xmath92 for @xmath93 fm in @xmath66o , @xmath94 in @xmath67ca , and @xmath95 in @xmath68ni .",
    "in contrast to the uniform limit , the microscopically calculated values of @xmath87 shown in table [ dineutronprob ] exhibit an significant enhancement especially at the surface and the external positions .",
    "the di - neutron correlation emerges systematically at different positions inside and outside the nucleus , as seen in fig.[cordens ] . inspecting in more detail , we find that , besides the width mentioned above , features of the di - neutron correlation vary with the reference neutron position . when the reference neutron is moved from the internal position ( @xmath96 fm ) to the surface ( @xmath71 ) , the di - neutron correlation apparently enhances .",
    "this is also seen in the di - neutron probability ( see the cases of @xmath66o , @xmath67ca and @xmath68ni in table [ dineutronprob ] ) , which shows an increase from @xmath97 at the internal position to @xmath98 at the surface position . moving further toward the outside , as represented by the external position in the skin region @xmath76 fm , the concentration of correlation density around the largest peak is constantly quite large , keeping the di - neutron probability @xmath99 .",
    "it is seen in this case that the peak position of the correlation density deviates slightly from the reference neutron position .",
    "the deviation is however within the di - neutron width @xmath81 , keeping a large spatial overlap of the other neutron with the reference one .",
    "as the reference neutron moves far outside the nucleus , the deviation from the reference neutron increases further whereas the spatial correlation survives rather robustly even around @xmath100 to @xmath101 fm in @xmath67ca and @xmath68ni .",
    "( an example of the correlation density with @xmath102 fm is shown in fig.[cordensstable3 ] . )",
    "this behavior also manifests itself in the pair probability @xmath87 : in @xmath67ca for example , this quantity with the reference neutron positions @xmath103 and @xmath104 fm reads @xmath105 and @xmath106 with @xmath107 and 6 fm chosen respectively to encompass the first largest peak whereas @xmath87 with fixed @xmath86(=3 fm ) decreases as @xmath108 at the same reference positions .",
    "we find a similar behavior in @xmath68ni while in @xmath66o the strong concentration of two - body correlation density is seen for @xmath109 fm .",
    "the above observations indicate that the di - neutron correlation is most strong in the surface and the skin regions while the spatial correlation associated with the di - neutron behavior remains and decreases only gradually even outside the skin .",
    "if we compare the oxygen , the calcium and the nickel isotopes in fig.[cordens ] , we observe that the concentration of two - body correlation density around the position of reference neutron is more evident in @xmath67ca and @xmath68ni than in @xmath66o .",
    "for example , the di - neutron probability in @xmath67ca and @xmath68ni is as large as the one in @xmath66o ( table[dineutronprob ] ) .",
    "this means that the enhancement relative to the uniform limit is much larger in @xmath67ca and especially in @xmath68ni than in @xmath66o .",
    "it is also seen that the oscillatory behavior apart from the largest peak is weaker in @xmath67ca and @xmath68ni than in @xmath66o , especially when the reference neutron is placed at the external position .",
    "the small oscillation is a remnant of nodal structure in the wave functions of neutron single - quasiparticle states near the fermi energy , e.g. , @xmath110 and @xmath111 neutron states in the case of @xmath66o although the magnitude of oscillation is suppressed by coherent contributions of other neutron quasiparticle states ( see the next subsection for details ) .",
    "the smearing of the single - particle structures is more effective in heavier systems as more single - particle levels participate in the pairing correlation .",
    "it should be noted also that among the three isotopes the neutron separation energy ( related to the fermi energy ) is smaller in @xmath67ca and especially in @xmath68ni than in @xmath66o ( see fig.[spenergy ] ) .",
    "this difference in the neutron binding also influences the neutron pairing correlation in the external region as discussed just below .",
    "we have also analyzed the neutron two - body correlation density along the isotopic chains of ca and ni to check the di - neutron property in more stable nuclei and to examine how the di - neutron correlation varies with approaching the neutron drip - line .",
    "we select @xmath112ca and @xmath113ni as examples representing stable nuclei and neutron - rich unstable nuclei ( situated between the drip - line and the stable region ) , respectively . here",
    "@xmath113ni is chosen to compare with the near - drip - line nucleus @xmath67ca having the same neutron number @xmath114 , and also with the near - drip - line isotope @xmath68ni .",
    "it is found that the gross behavior of the two - body correlation density in @xmath112ca and @xmath113ni is similar to those in @xmath67ca and @xmath68ni in the surface and the internal regions . as a representative example",
    ", we show in fig.[cordenscani ] the two - body correlation density in @xmath112ca and @xmath113ni for the reference neutron fixed at the surface ( @xmath71 ) . in table",
    "[ dineutronprob ] we do not see obvious difference between the near - drip - line nuclei and the more stable ones in the di - neutron probabilities @xmath87 at the internal position @xmath96 fm and at the surface @xmath71 .",
    "a clear difference emerges , however , as the reference neutron is placed far outside the nuclear surface .",
    "this is illustrated by fig.[cordensstable3 ] , where we compare the correlation densities in @xmath113ni , @xmath68ni and @xmath67ca with a reference neutron fixed at a position ( @xmath115 fm ) in the far outside region .",
    "it is seen that the value of the correlation density evaluated at the reference neutron position is lower in @xmath113ni by a factor of two or more than in near - drip - line nuclei @xmath67ca and @xmath68ni .",
    "it is also seen that the large correlation density at the position of the reference neutron is most significant in @xmath68ni .",
    "this indicates that the di - neutron correlation in the external region is stronger in near - drip - line nuclei having shallower neutron fermi energy than that in more stable nuclei with deeper fermi energy ( see fig.[spenergy ] for the single - particle energies and the fermi energy in these nuclei ) .",
    "we can see directly this property also in the profiles of the pair density @xmath116 of neutrons , shown in fig.[density ] .",
    "the pair density @xmath116 has comparable or larger magnitude @xmath117 with the normal density @xmath118 in the skin region @xmath119 fm and far outside . as discussed in ref.@xcite , the exponential tail constant of the neutron pair density @xmath116 in the asymptotic external region",
    "is related to the fermi energy .",
    "the asymptotic tail develops as the drip line is approached , and is longer than that of the normal density @xmath118 .",
    "consequently the di - neutron correlation in the external low density region becomes relatively stronger in nuclei near neutron drip - line .      in obtaining the significant di - neutron correlation ,",
    "it is essential to adopt a large model space of neutron quasiparticle states including continuum orbits up to large quasiparticle energy ( @xmath43 mev in the present calculation ) and large orbital angular momentum ( @xmath44 ) . on the contrary",
    ", significant di - neutron correlation would not be obtained if we used a small single - particle model space .    in the case of the oxygen isotopes , for example",
    ", one may consider that neutron single - particle orbits @xmath110 and @xmath111 lying around the neutron fermi energy are those most responsible for the neutron pairing .",
    "( note that the woods - saxon @xmath120 orbit is not a bound orbit but a resonance close to the zero energy .",
    "see fig.[spenergy ] . ) however , if one truncates to a single-@xmath121 orbit or to orbits in one major shell , the di - neutron correlation never shows up .",
    "this is because the two - body correlation density would exhibit a mirror symmetry with respect to the @xmath122-@xmath123 plane if only orbits with the same parity are taken into account .",
    "apparently one needs more single - particle orbits with additional orbital angular momenta having different parities .    in fig.[cordenslcut ] , we show partial contributions of neutron quasiparticle orbits truncated with respect to the orbital angular momentum @xmath6 of the orbits .",
    "namely the two - body correlation density is evaluated by including the neutron quasiparticle states only up to a cut - off orbital angular momentum @xmath124 .",
    "inclusion of low angular momenta @xmath125 covering at least all the neutron bound woods - saxon single - particle orbits in @xmath66o is insufficient to bring about the di - neutron correlation at the surface and the external positions ; see the line corresponding to @xmath126 .",
    "if we add @xmath127 @xmath128 orbits ( @xmath129 ) , the di - neutron correlation becomes more visible , but an approximate convergence is achieved only by including further @xmath130 orbits .",
    "it should be noted here that the neutron quasiparticle orbits with high angular momentum ( @xmath131 ) are continuum states with @xmath132 .",
    "it is the pair correlation that makes these high-@xmath6 continuum orbits to contribute to the ground state pair correlation .",
    "fig.[cordenslcut ] indicates that the continuum high-@xmath6 orbits are important also for ca and ni isotopes , for which a larger value of angular momenta up to @xmath133 at @xmath71 and @xmath134 at @xmath135 fm are necessary .",
    "the large contribution of the neutron high-@xmath6 quasiparticle orbits is related to the fact that the di - neutron correlation has a characteristic small width @xmath136 fm , which indicates an attraction within a short relative distance between two neutrons .",
    "it is illustrative to consider a pair of neutrons which are correlated in the _ relative s - wave _ at zero relative distance , and whose center of gravity is located off the nuclear center .",
    "a corresponding two particle wave function is written as @xmath137 where @xmath6 is the orbital angular momentum about the nuclear center .",
    "this expression indicates that a coherent superposition of orbits with all orbital angular momenta @xmath6 are necessary for such a correlation . on a similar basis",
    ", we can argue that a superposition of angular momenta up to @xmath138 is needed to describe the di - neutron correlation which is dominantly in the relative @xmath139-wave and has a width approximately given by @xmath140 ( @xmath141 being the radial position of the center of gravity of the pair ) .",
    "this estimate based on the observed di - neutron width @xmath136 fm gives a qualitative ( though not precise ) account of the maximum angular momentum seen in fig.[cordenslcut ] .",
    "we have also examined contribution of the orbits by truncating the neutron quasiparticle states up to a cut - off quasiparticle energy @xmath142 .",
    "results are shown in fig.[cordensecut ] .",
    "the di - neutron correlation never appears only with the small model space including only up to @xmath143 mev , which usually covers most of the quasiparticle states in one major shell .",
    "the results with cut - off of @xmath144 mev display only weak di - neutron correlation , and one needs neutron quasiparticle states at least up to @xmath145 mev to obtain a qualitative account of the di - neutron correlation . as the neutron fermi energy is small ( @xmath146 , and @xmath147 mev in the case of @xmath66o , @xmath67ca , and @xmath68ni , respectively ) , the quasiparticle states that contribute to the di - neutron correlation are mostly those embedded in the continuum energy region @xmath132 .",
    "most of the neutron continuum states are non - resonant states except for a few corresponding to the hole neutron orbits ( e.g. @xmath148 and @xmath149 ) which have specific quasiparticle energies .",
    "the slow convergence with respect to the quasiparticle energy indicates that the non - resonant continuum states give non - negligible and accumulating contributions to the di - neutron correlation .",
    "it is noted that contribution of quasiparticle states with relatively small quasiparticle energy is important in the case of the external position .",
    "this may be related to the fact the pair correlation becomes weaker in the external region .",
    "we have examined also dependence of the di - neutron correlation on the pairing force strength @xmath48 . here",

    "it is noted that increase of the pairing force strength @xmath48 enhances the di - neutron correlation , i.e. , increases the intensity of only the first largest peak , rather than causing overall enhancement of the two - body correlation density .",
    "this indicates that the di - neutron behavior is indeed a correlation effect caused by the attractive interaction among neutrons .",
    "it is expected that the density dependence of the pairing interaction influences the di - neutron correlation since the pairing force of the surface and the mixed types give stronger neutron - neutron attraction in the surface and the external regions than in the interior . the volume pairing force ( the density independent force ) does not have this feature . to examine the influence of the density dependence ,",

    "the calculated two - body correlation density is shown in fig.[cordens - dd ] .",
    "it indicates that the density dependence indeed affects the di - neutron correlation .",
    "namely , in the case of surface pairing , the calculated two - body correlation density is significantly large in the surface ( e.g. @xmath71 ) and the exterior regions ( @xmath135 fm ) but it is weak in the internal region ( @xmath96 fm )",
    ". the volume pairing force does not exhibit such a position dependence . in the case of the mixed pairing force",
    ", the two - body correlation displays an intermediate feature as seen from comparison of figs.[cordenslcut ] and [ cordens - dd ] .",
    "we emphasize also that the di - neutron correlation can not be properly described if one adopts the schematic seniority pairing force used together with the conventional bcs approximation , where a constant pairing gap @xmath155 is assumed instead of the selfconsistent pair potential @xmath156 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.[cordens - bcs ] , where we present a bcs calculation obtained with use of the standard analytic expression of @xmath157-factors , the woods - saxon single - particle energies , and the gap constant @xmath155 .",
    "we include all bound and discretized continuum woods - saxon neutron orbits ( obtained with the box radius @xmath42 fm ) , and use the same cut - off parameters @xmath43 mev and @xmath44 as in the hfb calculation .",
    "the value of @xmath155 is set to that of the average neutron gap @xmath154 obtained in the hfb calculation .",
    "it is seen that the bcs calculation causes a significant overestimate of the correlation density when the reference neutron is placed at external positions . in the case of surface and internal positions ,",
    "the disagreement with the hfb is less serious , but profiles of the two - body correlation density are not well reproduced , as shown in fig.[cordens - bcs ] .",
    "the unwanted overestimate in the external region arises from contributions of the discretized woods - saxon orbits in the positive - energy continuum region , for which the bcs approximation is known to cause unphysical correlation@xcite .",
    "if we neglect the discretized continuum woods - saxon orbits to avoid this difficulty , however , the bcs approximation produces a result ( dotted line in fig.[cordens - bcs ] ) which is far off the hfb result , and the di - neutron correlation never shows up .      the small width @xmath136 fm of the di - neutron correlation , or the di - neutron size in short , provides a characteristic length scale of the neutron pairing correlation .",
    "we note that this di - neutron size should be distinguished from the coherence length ( the pippard s coherence length ) , which plays a central role in the standard bcs theory of the metal superconductivity . the pippard s coherence length for a superconducting uniform matter",
    "is given analytically as @xmath158 with @xmath159 and @xmath160 being the fermi velocity and the pairing gap@xcite .",
    "a direct application of @xmath161 to the nuclear case with typical values of @xmath159 and @xmath160 gives the coherence length of an order of 10fm which is larger than the nuclear radius .",
    "if this estimate is adopted , the wave function of neutron pairs is meant to extend in the whole region of nuclear volume@xcite .",
    "the present numerical investigation , however , reveals that the probability distribution of the neutron pair wave function is far from uniform , and a large probability @xmath4 is concentrated in a small region with short relative distances @xmath162 fm while the rest probability spreads in the whole nuclear volume .",
    "our finding suggests that we may need at least two length scales ( one is the di - neutron size and the other is the coherence length ) to characterize the nuclear pairing correlation .",
    "we note also that the two - neutron correlation is calculated by barranco et al.@xcite in a microscopic hfb description of the neutron pairing in the non - uniform low density neutron matter in a wigner - seiz cell with a immersed lattice nucleus , approximating the situation of an inner crust of neutron stars .",
    "the authors point out that the root mean square relative distance weighted with the two - neutron probability density coincides approximately with the pippard s coherence length @xmath161 .",
    "the calculated two - neutron probability itself ( fig.3 in ref.@xcite ) , on the other hand , shows a distribution that forms a sharp and large peak at short relative distances @xmath162 fm , indicating a behavior similar to the di - neutron correlation discussed in the present investigation .",
    "this might suggest that the presence of the di - neutron correlation with a small length scale @xmath163 fm is a quite general feature of the nuclear pairing correlation .",
    "the hfb calculation in ref.@xcite adopts the finite range gogny force as the effective pairing force . combining the results of ref.@xcite and ours",
    ", it can be suggested that the qualitative feature of the di - neutron correlation persists irrespective of detailed forms of the effective pairing force .",

    "we first recapitulate briefly the continuum qrpa method@xcite which we adopt to describe the dipole excitation of nuclei near drip - line .",
    "it provides a fully microscopic description of a linear response of the nucleus excited by an external perturbing field with taking into account all nucleon degrees of freedom .",

    "note that the shell model@xcite and the phonon coupling model@xcite based on the skyrme hf+bcs+qrpa approach exhibit a saturation around @xmath66o .",
    "comparing among o , ca , and ni isotopic chains , we observe slightly different behaviors in the soft dipole excitation . in the case of ni isotopes ,",

    "the pairing effect is negligible in the case of @xmath253o , but this is because the pair correlation itself is very small ( @xmath254 mev ) in this nucleus . _ ii ) in the calcium isotopes _ , the pairing correlation does not enhance the magnitude of e1 strength .",
    "instead it shifts the low - lying dipole strength up in the excitation energy and/or it suppresses the strength of the soft dipole excitation . the suppression in the e1 strength is about 20% in @xmath255ca ( see table [ e1strengthcani ] ) .",
    "_ iii ) in the nickel isotopes _ , the neutron pair correlation either suppresses significantly the e1 strength at low energies ( in @xmath256ni by about 30% , see table [ e1strengthcani ] ) or modifies the shape of strength distribution ( in @xmath257ni , see fig.[e1softpair ] ) .",
    "after all , the pair correlation certainly influences the strength distribution of the soft dipole excitation , but it can either enhance ( as in the case of @xmath249o ) or suppress ( as in @xmath255ca,@xmath256ni ) the e1 strength .    to analyze the pair correlation effect ,",

    "note that the pair correlation changes the static mean - fields in the hfb hamiltonian , in particular the pair potential @xmath156 .",
    "this mean - field effect modifies the ground state configuration and the single - particle excitation , through which the excitation properties are also affected .",
    "we call this mechanism _ the static pair correlation effect_. on the other hand , the rpa correlation associated with the dynamical variation in the pair potential @xmath258 gives the additional pair correlation effect on the excitation , which we call the _ dynamical pair correlation effect_. in other words , the dynamical pair correlation effect originates from the residual interaction taken into account in the rpa equation ( [ rpa ] ) , while the static effect are present even in the unperturbed response . to examine these pair correlation effects separately , we have performed calculations where the dynamical pair correlation is neglected while keeping the static pairing effects .",
    "result is shown in fig.[e1softpair ] with the dashed line .",
    "it is immediately seen that both the static and the dynamical correlations give considerable effects on the dipole strength in the soft excitation region .",
    "let us first focus on _ the static pairing effect_. it is seen that the static effect is a major part of the net pairing effect on the dipole strength , and produces qualitative trends of the strength function , although the dynamical effect can not be neglected for quantitative description . to get more insight to the static effect",
    ", we look into the unperturbed strength function which is obtained by neglecting all the residual interactions(fig.[e1unp ] ) . in the unperturbed strength ,",
    "we separate contributions from different two - quasiparticle excitations by selecting a specified pair of angular momenta of the two - quasiparticle configurations . taking @xmath66o as an example , where the pairing effect on the soft dipole excitation is large , we find that the static pairing effect increases the unperturbed e1 strength . this arises mainly from a contribution of a neutron two - quasiparticle configuration exciting the @xmath110 state and the continuum @xmath243 states coupled to @xmath259 , abbreviated as @xmath260_{l=1}$ ] or more shortly @xmath261 ( the asterisk denotes the continuum states ) , as seen from comparison between the left top and the left bottom panels of fig.[e1unp ] .",
    "this quasiparticle excitation is available only by taking into account the ground state pair correlation .",
    "this is because the woods - saxon @xmath110 orbit located above the fermi energy ( fig.[spenergy ] ) can be partially occupied only if the pair correlation is included .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath261 configuration to the dipole strength is added with those of @xmath262 configurations , which are dominant ones when the pairing is neglected ( see the lower panel of fig.[e1unp ] ) . in @xmath263o , the increase of dipole strength due to the static pairing effect",
    "is similarly seen , but it not very large since the occupation of the @xmath110 orbit is smaller .",
    "another aspect of the static pairing effect is that it pushes up the strength to slightly higher energy .",
    "this is because the pair correlation increases the energy of the two - quasiparticle excitation than that of the corresponding unpaired particle - hole excitation .",
    "the static pairing effect in ca and ni isotopes appears different from that in the oxygen isotopes .",
    "for example , it causes the large suppression of the e1 strength in @xmath256ni , which is explained in terms of the neutron @xmath239 orbit .",
    "this orbit would be fully occupied by the last two neutrons if we neglected the pair correlation ( cf .",
    "fig.[spenergy ] ) . since the @xmath239 orbit is only weakly bound ( the woods - saxon single - particle energy @xmath264 mev ) and has an spatially extended wave function , the particle - hole excitations from this orbit to the continuum @xmath243 orbits bring about a large e1 strength just above the one - neutron threshold energy , which is often referred to as the threshold strength ( cf .",
    "the right lower panel of fig.[e1unp ] ) .",
    "once the neutron pair correlation is included , the associated strength is reduced as the @xmath239 orbit becomes partially occupied , making the contribution of the two - quasiparticle configurations @xmath265 to the dipole strength significantly smaller . in ca isotopes , the unperturbed strength in the soft dipole strength",
    "is dominated by contributions of the two - quasiparticle excitations @xmath266 and @xmath267 ( fig.[e1unp ] ) .",
    "the increase in the quasiparticle energy of the @xmath244 state caused by the pair correlation pushes up the peak around @xmath268 mev by about 1mev .",
    "we thus conclude that the static pairing effect shows variety in different nuclides , depending strongly on low - energy quasiparticle states ( around the fermi energy ) which are quite sensitive to the pairing correlation .",
    "we then look into _ the dynamical pairing effect_. we immediately see that , in contrast to the static effect , the dynamical pairing effect has a systematic tendency to increase the dipole strength in all examples shown in fig.[e1softpair ] although the magnitude of the increase varies .",
    "the effect on @xmath251 associated with the soft dipole excitation is shown in tables [ e1strength ] and [ e1strengthcani ] . the largest effect on @xmath251 amounting to @xmath269 is seen in @xmath10o , and @xmath270 in the nickel isotopes .",
    "the increase of the strength due to the dynamical pairing effect is found in the previous qrpa calculations for oxygen isotopes@xcite .",
    "we here find that the increase due to the dynamical pairing correlation is universally seen in spherical nuclei near drip - line in the medium mass region .",
    "note also that the enhancement due to the dynamical pairing effect has a similarity to the pair interaction effect predicted on the soft dipole excitation in the two - neutron halo nucleus @xmath9li@xcite .",

    "the particle - hole amplitudes of neutrons and protons have the same sign , but with the opposite phase to the external neutron amplitude , indicating that both neutrons and protons in this region move coherently against the external neutron motion .",

    "the dominance of @xmath272 indicates that the soft dipole excitation has a character of a particle - particle excitation : it is more appropriate to characterize the soft dipole excitation as a motion of spin - singlet neutron pair in the external region , than to describe as a simple particle - hole excitation of a neutron to continuum states .",
    "we also note that the particle - pair transition density @xmath272 displays a characteristic isotopic dependence .",
    "the large particle - pair amplitude in @xmath276ca and @xmath10o decreases with increasing the neutron number , while the particle - hole amplitude increases in the other way .",

    "i ) the static pairing effect : _ generally low energy two - quasiparticle excitations , which are building blocks of low - lying excitations under the influence of pairing correlation , carry simultaneously particle - hole , particle - pair and hole - pair amplitudes . on the contrary ,",
    "only the particle - hole amplitude would exist if the static pairing correlation were absent in the case of @xmath121-shell closed nuclei . as an example , let us consider the neutron two - quasiparticle excitations @xmath261 and @xmath278 ( and @xmath279 ) , which give dominant contributions to unperturbed strength function in @xmath66o ( cf .",
    "fig.[e1unp ] ) .",
    "we first note that the two - quasiparticle configuration @xmath261 would never participate in the soft dipole excitation if the pairing correlation were absent . with the pairing correlation",
    "included , the quasiparticle state @xmath110 has a large amplitude both in the upper and lower components ( corresponding to the particle and hole components , respectively ) of the wave function since it is located near the fermi energy .",
    "accordingly the two - quasiparticle configuration @xmath261 brings a large amplitude both in the particle - hole transition density @xmath271 and in the particle - pair transition density @xmath272 .",
    "( the hole - pair transition density @xmath273 is small since both @xmath110 and @xmath280 are located above the fermi energy , and particle characters are dominant in these quasiparticle states . )",
    "the amplitudes @xmath272 and @xmath271 associated with the configuration @xmath261 is especially large in the exterior region as the quasiparticle wave function of the @xmath110 state is spatially extended to the outside .",
    "the other dominant configuration @xmath281 contributes also to the particle - pair transition density in a similar way .",
    "the nodal pattern of the transition densities is consistent with the mixture of these two - quasiparticle configurations .",
    "the particle - particle character of these two - quasiparticle excitations in @xmath235o decreases as the fermi energy ( the neutron number ) increases . in @xmath253o ,",
    "the particle - particle character becomes small as the quasiparticle states @xmath282 and @xmath110 both have a dominant hole character .",
    "the qualitative trends observed in the transition densities can be connected in this way to the properties of the relevant quasiparticle states .",
    "similar mechanism are applied to the calcium isotopes , where the neutron @xmath283 states play a central role . in the nickel isotopes ,",
    "the relevant neutron quasiparticle states are @xmath239 and @xmath240 ( see figs.[spenergy ] and [ e1unp ] ) .",
    "_ ii ) the dynamical pairing effect : _ it is clear that the static pairing effects discussed above explains only qualitative aspects of the transition densities since the static pairing effect alone explains about a half of the particle - pair transition amplitude .",
    "the dynamical effect adds an essential enhancement in @xmath272 especially in the external region which is most relevant to the soft dipole excitation .",
    "the increase by a factor of 2 in the particle - pair transition amplitude @xmath272 corresponds to an enhancement of a factor of about four in the strength of neutron pair transfer .",
    "namely the characteristic particle - pair dominance of the soft excitation is strongly affected by the rpa correlations .",
    "this means that the calculated soft dipole excitation can not be explained as a few representative two - quasiparticle configurations which we find responsible for the static pairing effect , such as @xmath261 or @xmath284 in the case of o isotopes , this conclusion is quite different from that of the rpa calculations neglecting the pair correlations@xcite , which predict the soft dipole excitation in neutron - rich oxygen isotopes as a non - collective independent particle - hole excitation of weakly bound neutrons .",
    "we shall investigate nature of the large dynamical pairing effect on the particle - pair transition density @xmath272 .",
    "the large amplitude in @xmath272 itself indicates that the pair correlation enhances the probability to find two neutrons participating in the soft dipole excitation at the same position @xmath55 .",
    "it is then tempting to interpret it in connection with the di - neutron correlation which we found in the ground state . to check this viewpoint , we examine contributions of high-@xmath6 quasiparticle orbits to the soft dipole excitations .",
    "we have performed calculations where contribution of quasiparticles with high angular momenta is truncated in evaluating the rpa correlations . in practice",
    ", we put an upper cut - off @xmath124 to the sum over orbital angular momenta @xmath6 and @xmath285 of the two quasiparticle configurations in the density response function , eq.([uresp ] ) .",
    "if the pairing correlation is completely neglected , the angular momentum of quasiparticles contributing to the dipole response is limited in a small range @xmath286 , where @xmath287 is the largest orbital angular momenta of the occupied bound woods - saxon single - particle orbits . in the case of oxygen isotopes @xmath0o ,",
    "for instance , neutrons would occupy @xmath288 and @xmath289 bound orbits in the ground state in the null pairing case , and hence only the angular momentum combinations @xmath290_{l=1}$ ] , @xmath291_{l=1}$ ] and @xmath292_{l=1}$ ] contribute .",
    "the cut - off @xmath293 is sufficient in this case .",
    "as the pairing correlation is taken into account , however , all combinations including @xmath5_{l=1}$ ] with @xmath294 are allowed to contribute .",
    "note that these high-@xmath6 quasiparticle states are all continuum orbits .",
    "results of the truncated calculations are shown in fig.[trdenslcut ] .",
    "it is seen that contributions from neutron high-@xmath6 quasiparticle states with @xmath295 are essential to produce the large enhancement in the particle - particle transition density . in @xmath66o and @xmath255ca , the angular momenta up to @xmath296 and @xmath297 respectively are necessary to approach the final result . in @xmath68ni , the orbits up to @xmath298 contribute in the external region up to @xmath299 fm , but very high angular momenta @xmath300 still continue to influence in the far outside @xmath301 fm . the particle - hole transition amplitude @xmath271 , on the other hand , is affected very little by the high-@xmath6 continuum configurations with @xmath295 , as seen in fig.[trdenslcut ] .    we thus conclude that the neutron correlation responsible for the large enhancement of the particle - pair transition density @xmath272 in the soft dipole excitation is associated with a coherent superposition of a large number of neutron two - quasiparticle configurations with angular momentum coupling @xmath302_{l=1}$ ] involving up to large values of @xmath6 .",
    "the accumulating high-@xmath6 contribution can be viewed as an evidence that two neutrons carrying the soft dipole mode are spatially correlated at short relative distance in such a way that we have seen the di - neutron correlation in the ground state ( cf .",
    "section [ dineutron - spconfig ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the soft dipole excitation is characterized rather strongly by motion of a spin - singlet di - neutron in the nuclear exterior against the remaining @xmath8 system .",
    "it is noted that much larger values of angular momentum contribute in the soft dipole excitation than in the ground state . in @xmath68ni , for example , we need angular momentum up to @xmath303 to achieve an approximate convergence around @xmath304 fm where the pair transition density has the dominant distribution .",
    "this is because the di - correlation correlation in the soft dipole excitation takes place in much far outside of the nuclear surface than that in the case of the ground state .",
    "note also that in @xmath68ni convergence of high-@xmath6 contributions to the particle - pair transition density @xmath272 is slow in the very far exterior @xmath305 fm even around the maximum angular momentum @xmath306 .",
    "this is related to the fact that two neutrons can escape simultaneously in the nickel isotopes where the soft dipole mode lies above the two neutron threshold energy @xmath307 .",
    "the oscillation of @xmath272 at @xmath308 fm indeed indicates a sizable two - neutron escaping .",
    "the slow convergence with respect to the angular momentum at very large distances suggests that there exists the pair correlation between the two escaping neutrons .",
    "since the soft dipole excitation is strongly influenced by the neutron pairing correlation , sensitivity of the soft dipole excitation to the effective pairing force is expected .",
    "we shall examine this issue in connection with the di - neutron correlation .",
    "we have performed an analysis to see dependence on the force strength @xmath48 for @xmath66o taken as an representative example .",
    "we increase the strength @xmath309 of the mixed pairing force from the reference value @xmath50 mev@xmath51 ( corresponding to @xmath150 mev fitted to the experimental odd - even mass difference ) to @xmath151 mev@xmath51 ( @xmath152 mev representing the conventional systematics @xmath310 mev ) , as is done in section [ dineutron - in - gs ] .",
    "the calculated e1 strength function and the particle - pair transition density are compared in fig.[e1softpair - pair ] . as expected",
    ", the increase of @xmath48 modifies the strength distribution of the soft dipole excitation : the dipole strength calculated with @xmath151 mev@xmath51 is larger than that with @xmath50 mev@xmath51 . as seen in the right panel of the fig.[e1softpair - pair ] , the increase is caused essentially by the dynamical pairing correlation .",
    "more dramatic sensitivity is recognized in the particle - pair transition density @xmath272 , on which the dynamical pairing effect becomes significantly larger with increasing @xmath48 .",
    "these observations are consistent with the picture that the di - neutron correlation manifests itself in the soft dipole excitation .",
    "it is also in accord with the finding in the previous section that the increase of @xmath48 enhances the di - neutron correlation in the ground state ( see .",
    "section [ pairdependence - gs ] and fig.[cordens - pair ] ) .",
    "we have also examined sensitivity to the density dependence of the pairing force .",
    "to this end , we performed calculations with use of the volume pairing ( the density independent ) force , and the surface pairing force with strong density dependence as is done in section [ dineutron - in - gs ]",
    ". calculated results are shown in figs.[e1softpair - dd ] and [ trdens - dd ] , which may be compared also with those using the mixed pairing force , representing an intermediate density dependent force ( cf .",
    "figs.[e1softpair ] , [ trdenso ] , [ trdensca ] and [ trdensni ] ) .",
    "figs.[e1softpair - dd ] and [ trdens - dd ] clearly show that results are very different with different density dependences .",
    "it is seen that the dynamical enhancement of the particle - pair transition density @xmath272 in the external region ( @xmath277 ) is much larger with the surface paring force than with the mixed and the volume pairing forces ( fig.[trdens - dd ] ) .",
    "this trend is also seen in the e1 strength ( fig.[e1softpair - dd ] ) . in the case of the volume pairing force ,",
    "on the other hand , the dynamical pairing effect on the strength function becomes almost insignificant , and even the particle - pair transition density is not strongly enhanced .",
    "note that the neutron - neutron attraction acting in the low - density external region is proportional to the value of @xmath48 , which differs as @xmath311 mev@xmath51 for the volume , the mixed , and the surface pairing forces , respectively .",
    "thus the above observation implies that the soft dipole excitation , especially the associated particle - pair transition density , is quite sensitive to the effective pairing force among neutrons moving in the low - density part outside the nuclear surface .",
    "this is of course related to the fact that the soft dipole excitation is essentially a mode carried by the correlated neutrons moving in the nuclear exterior . in addition , the strong sensitivity to the density dependence is in accord with a similar behavior of the di - neutron correlation in the ground state ( cf .",
    "fig.[cordens - dd ] ) .",
    "this again supports the picture that the soft dipole excitation is strongly influenced by the neutron pairing correlation of the di - neutron type .",
    "we have investigated the neutron pairing correlations and their influences on the soft dipole excitation in medium mass nuclei near neutron drip - line from the viewpoint of the di - neutron correlation .",
    "the analysis using the two - body correlation density has revealed the presence of spatial di - neutron correlation in the pair correlated ground state in nuclei near drip - line .",
    "it is found that correlated neutron pairs exhibit a strong concentration of the probability of about 30 - 60% at short relative distances @xmath312 fm , which is much smaller than the nuclear radius .",
    "this di - neutron correlation enhances in the surface and the skin regions in near - drip - line nuclei although it also exists inside the nucleus and also in stable nuclei along the isotopic chain .",
    "the di - neutron correlation originates from coherent superposition of the single - particle ( quasiparticle ) orbits with large orbital angular momenta , which are embedded in the continuum energy region .",
    "we have analyzed the soft dipole excitation to search for the di - neutron correlation in this mode .",
    "it is found that the particle - pair transition density of neutrons in the soft dipole excitation is quite large outside the nuclear surface .",
    "this originates from the dynamical pairing correlation among neutrons moving in the external region , i.e. , the rpa correlation for the excited state caused by the pairing interaction .",
    "indeed the dynamical pair correlation is responsible for enhancing the particle - pair transition density by a factor of about two or more .",
    "this indicates that the soft dipole excitation under the influence of neutron pairing correlation has a dominant particle - particle character , rather than an uncorrelated particle - hole excitation from a weakly orbit to continuum orbits .",
    "we find also that two - quasiparticle configurations @xmath302_{l=1}$ ] involving continuum high-@xmath6 orbits up to around @xmath297 accumulate coherently to bring about the large particle - pair transition density .",
    "this strongly suggests that there is the di - neutron correlation among neutrons participating in the soft dipole excitation .",
    "we are thus lead to a picture that in the soft dipole excitation a spin - singlet di - neutron move outside the nucleus against the @xmath8 subsystem .",
    "our analysis reveals also that the characteristic neutron pairing effects are sensitive to the density dependence of the effective pairing force .",
    "the influence of neutron pairing correlation on the dipole strength is sizable , but not always causes enhancement .",
    "the di - neutron correlation emerges more clearly in the particle - particle channel .",
    "we expect that the di - neutron correlation present in the soft dipole excitation may be most easily and directly probed in the two - particle correlation among two neutrons escaping from the excited state , or in transfer of neutrons to the excited state .",
    "these processes may also be used as a probe to study the density dependence of the nuclear pairing correlations .",
    "these issues are interesting subjects for future investigations .",
