    "functional integration is an extremely useful tool for the non - perturbative analysis of quantum field theories ( qft from now on ) . to ensure that calculations involving these integrals be well defined , it is convenient to regularize them by working on a spacetime lattice .",
    "a continuum qft is then _ defined _ in terms of a sequence of lattice field theories",
    ". there may be many lattice representations for a single continuum theory , so it is not obvious that such a definition is unique . in the majority of lattice field theory simulations ,",
    "the issue of uniqueness is addressed by appealing to the principle of universality .",
    "universality is the property that , in the continuum limit , the system ceases to depend on the exact nature of the lattice theory , and many different lattice field theories lead to the same qft . in the approach to the continuum limit , which is located at special ",
    "critical  values of the coupling parameters , various quantities are expected to have a universal dependence on the couplings .",
    "two different lattice theories that display the same behavior at this critical point are said to belong to the same universality class .    in the present paper ,",
    "lattice models that do not to conform to this expectation of universality are described , and the extent of universal behavior is clarified somewhat .",
    "four models are considered here : two lattice versions of the @xmath0 nonlinear sigma model and two lattice versions of the @xmath1 sigma model . in each case",
    "the two lattice models become the same classical theory in the _ classical _ continuum limit .",
    "numerical evidence strongly suggests @xcite that both lattice @xmath2 models _ do _ belong to the same universality class in the sense that they both describe a pair of free uncoupled massless scalar fields in the continuum limit ( they are trivial ) .",
    "the situation for the @xmath0 models is not as clear .",
    "one lattice @xmath0 model is known to become a free massless scalar field in the continuum limit , but the continuum limit of the other lattice model is unknown . the current numerical data does not rule out triviality .",
    "all of these lattice theories , however , have an order parameter , called the magnetization , which _ is _ sensitive to the details of the lattice model near the critical point .",
    "this is unlike the behavior observed in more familiar models , such as the ising model or the _ compact _ nonlinear sigma models @xcite .",
    "it is argued that the cause for this nonuniversal behavior is the radically different scaling of the fields with a parameter @xmath3 ( analogous to an inverse temperature in statistical mechanics ) that is made possible by the noncompact configuration spaces .",
    "this point will be further discussed in section [ concl ] .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "the relevance of universality to lattice field theory is then explained .",
    "the language of the renormalization group ( rg from now on ) is used to show why certain quantities ( _ e.g. _ critical exponents ) are expected to be the same for lattice field theories that are in the same universality class .",
    "in addition , the process through which two different lattice theories become the same qft in the continuum limit is explained in terms of the concept of irrelevant operators .",

    "[ o11 ] introduces two possible lattice @xmath0 models and shows that they have different behavior in the critical region .",
    "[ o21 ] discusses the analogous situation for the @xmath1 model . in sec .",
    "[ concl ] the reason for the nonuniversal behavior is discussed , and the conclusions are presented .    it should be noted that unlike the two and three dimensional models that are of interest in the related discipline of critical phenomena , this article deals with models in four spacetime dimensions , since the motivation is to study quantum field theory . to carry out numerical simulations of the lattice field theory ,",
    "it is necessary to analytically continue the time into the euclidean regime .",
    "the result of this euclideanization is mathematically equivalent to a statistical mechanical partition function , with a hamiltonian given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the euclidean action of the lattice field theory .",
    "a quantum field theory is constructed from a lattice field theory as follows .",
    "the qft is defined by the vacuum expectation values of time ordered products of operators built out of the local quantum fields . these time",
    "ordered products can be expressed in terms of functional integrals .",
    "the functional integrals are in turn defined by discretizing spacetime , which turns them into multiple integrals , albeit in a very high dimensional space .",
    "the multiple integrals are then amenable to numerical analysis through monte carlo techniques .",
    "the lattice field theory approximants to the expectation values of the continuum qft can then be calculated .",
    "the simulations are carried out on successively larger lattices , and the approximants are then extrapolated to the continuum limit to yield the desired continuum vacuum expectation values .    thus , there are two identifiable stages in the process of quantization through functional integrals .",
    "first , a lattice field theory is defined as a large dimensional multiple integral with an action constructed from the classical action .",
    "second , the continuum qft is recovered as the limit of a sequence of lattice theories simulated on successively larger lattices , with the lattice spacing simultaneously considered to be taken to zero .",
    "if the continuum qft contains any finite length scale , such as the inverse of the mass or the correlation length @xmath6 , this length scale becomes infinite when measured in units of the lattice spacing @xmath7 , which goes to zero in the continuum limit .",
    "therefore , in the second stage , when the lattice spacing is taken to zero , it is necessary to identify a point in the parameter space of the theory where the lattice version of the characteristic length scale of the qft diverges in units of the lattice spacing .",
    "the correlation length of the nonlinear sigma models discussed here is already infinite on an infinite lattice because the models are massless . instead , the relevant length scale here is @xmath8 which is associated with the interaction .",
    "the continuum limit is sought where the characteristic length scale measured in units of the lattice spacing , @xmath9 , diverges ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "this means that a continuum limit exists only where @xmath11 .",
    "the lattice action constructed during the first stage is not unique , because the continuum action contains derivatives of the fields .",
    "the customary prescription for passing from the classical continuum action to the lattice action is to replace @xmath12 , where @xmath13 . here",
    "@xmath14 where @xmath7 is the lattice spacing , @xmath15 are integers , and @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) denotes the lattice site which is the nearest neighbor of @xmath18 in the forward @xmath19 direction . in the classical theory",
    ", one can perform a point transformation @xmath20 , and the equations of motion in terms of the new fields @xmath21 have the same content as the equations of motion in terms of the old fields",
    ". however , the lattice action obtained from the classical action expressed in terms of the fields @xmath21 will be different from the lattice action obtained from the classical action expressed in terms of the fields @xmath22 .",
    "the equivalence of the theories at the continuum classical level rests on the chain rule for differentiation , which is not valid on the lattice .",
    "it is not _ a priori _ clear that the continuum qft obtained at the second stage is the same for the two different lattice actions .    in the great body of lattice field theory simulations ,",
    "this possible ambiguity is circumvented by appealing to the principle of universality .",
    "the principle of universality maintains that , in the critical region , the large distance behavior of lattice systems is mostly independent of the small distance features , such as the detailed choice of the lattice action . in extrapolating to the continuum qft ,",
    "one reexpresses the observables of interest in units of appropriate physical lengths . in the continuum limit ,",
    "as noted above , these finite physical units of length become infinite as measured in terms of the lattice spacing .",
    "therefore , the specific features of the lattice action automatically become small distance features as compared to anything of interest in the continuum qft .",
    "universality requires that these small distance features be unimportant .",
    "more precisely , all possible lattice models separate into classes .",
    "all lattice field theories within a single universality class become the same qft in the continuum limit , but lattice models belonging to different universality classes yield different continuum qft s . from the point of view of quantum field theory",
    ", the details of the lattice theory do affect a small set of quantities that are nonuniversal in the critical region , but which do not affect the physical content of the continuum qft .",
    "on the other hand , in statistical mechanics , these nonuniversal quantities may have physical content .",
    "for example , in the models considered in this article , it is found that the magnetization , which is related to an expectation value of a field ( eq . [ magnet ] ) in one of the formulations of the @xmath1 model , has nonuniversal behavior .",
    "the magnetization is relevant for the wavefunction renormalization @xcite , but apparently does not affect the s matrix of the theory ( which is trivial ) .",
    "there are three criteria which determine a universality class .",
    "they are ( @xcite p.  80 ) :    1 .   the spacetime dimension of the system ; 2 .",
    "the internal symmetry group of the system , and which representation of this symmetry group is furnished by the fields in the lattice action ; 3 .   the nature of the critical point .",
    "these three criteria alone still leave one with the freedom to use many different lattice actions to simulate a given theory .",
    "although the above criteria are widely known , additional criteria may be needed to determine a universality class uniquely . _",
    "@xcite p.  18 .",
    "it is now seen how universality leads to a resolution of the ambiguity inherent in formulating a lattice field theory . to ensure that the lattice field theories under consideration go to the same continuum limit",
    ", the lattice actions must have the same spacetime dimension , have the same internal symmetry group , and be constructed out of fields belonging to the same group representation .",
    "it is _ not _ immediately clear that different lattice actions ( such as those obtained from the fields @xmath22 and @xmath21 in the discussion above ) , which satisfy criteria 1 ) and 2 ) will satisfy the third as well . it is commonly assumed that the first two criteria are sufficient .",
    "this is occasionally tested when numerical studies are carried out .",
    "this assumption is often made for scalar fields in four spacetime dimensions , and is buttressed by the strong evidence existing@xcite for the triviality of @xmath23 theory .",
    "however , for other scalar field theories , as yet unknown fixed points may exist .",
    "the principle of universality appears most natural in the framework of the renormalization group ( rg ) . a good introduction to the subject",
    "may be found in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite or @xcite while a detailed review is given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the following is a brief overview of the key ideas .",
    "as noted previously , the continuum limit is extracted from the features of the lattice theory with length scales much larger than the lattice spacing .",
    "the rg provides a means of studying these features by gradually integrating the high momentum degrees of freedom out of the lattice version of the partition function .",
    "a renormalization group transformation consists of the following steps :    1 .",
    "begin with an action defined at the scale of some cutoff @xmath24 ( on the lattice @xmath25 ) .",
    "this action should be _ the most general possible action consistent with the symmetries of the theory _ ; 2 .",
    "integrate modes with momenta in the range @xmath26 , out of the functional integral . here",
    "@xmath27 is some scale factor greater than one ; 3 .",
    "rescale all the remaining momenta by @xmath28 so as to restore the original cutoff @xmath24 ; 4 .",
    "redefine the dummy field variables of integration in the partition function by @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the function required to restore the kinetic term in the action ( @xmath31 ) to its original normalization .",
    "the effective action obtained after an rg transformation has the same form as the original action , but the coupling parameters are modified .",
    "rg transformations thus generate a flow in the space of coupling parameters . in the cases of interest , this flow terminates at a fixed point , at which the effective action is rg invariant .",
    "if the parameters in the original action have their critical values and the correlation length @xmath6 is infinite , then @xmath6 remains infinite under rg transformations .",
    "the flows that leave @xmath6 infinite generate a subspace of the coupling parameter space known as the _ critical surface_. it is assumed that every point on the critical surface flows to some fixed point .",
    "the theory at this fixed point has the same long distance behavior as any critical theory connected to it by rg transformations .",
    "it should be emphasized that the rg transformation changes the natural unit of length ( the lattice spacing ) .",
    "the long distance behavior is only the same in both cases _ when the same unit of length is used_. therefore , the long distance behavior of the original critical theory can be deduced by studying the theory at the fixed point .",
    "the origin of universality now becomes clear .",
    "the critical surface breaks up into domains , such that all the points in a domain flow to the same fixed point .",
    "each domain defines a universality class . within a given universality class ,",
    "the details of the lattice action of some starting critical theory are not important because all theories have the same long distance behavior as the fixed point theory .",
    "as will be shown below , the long distance behavior for a theory which is slightly off the critical surface , is the same as the behavior of the theory at some point in the neighborhood of the fixed point . for simplicity",
    ", the analysis of rg transformations in the neighborhood of the fixed point will be restriced to the case of a single coupling parameter . under a general rg transformation ,",
    "@xmath32 the function @xmath33 is a smooth function of the coupling parameter @xmath34 for a finite rescaling of the cutoff by @xmath27 .",
    "if @xmath34 is sufficiently close to the fixed point , where the coupling parameter has its fixed point value @xmath35 , the general rg transformation is well approximated by the linear part of its taylor expansion : @xmath36 considering two successive rg transformations with scale parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 , one finds @xmath39 this is just the semi - group property of the rg .",
    "the only possible functional form for @xmath40 is @xmath41 it is now seen that the behavior of the coupling constant @xmath34 near the fixed point under rg transformations is determined by the exponent @xmath42 .",
    "if @xmath43 , the coupling parameter is enhanced under an rg transformation , and @xmath34 is called a _ relevant _ coupling . if @xmath44 , it is suppressed , and it is called an _ irrelevant _ coupling . if @xmath45 , the coupling remains constant under rg transformations ( at least in the linear approximation ) and it is then called _",
    "marginal_. in the general case of an infinite set of couplings @xmath46 , @xmath40 becomes an infinite - dimensional matrix .",
    "the coupling parameters no longer transform as simply as in eq .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) .",
    "instead , the _ eigenvalues _ of @xmath40 transform in this simple manner .",
    "these eigenvalues are usually called _ scaling fields_. the coupling parameters , however , are linear combinations of the scaling fields .",
    "the operators multiplying the scaling fields in the action are also called relevant , irrelevant , or marginal , according to the behavior of the associated scaling fields .",
    "terms multiplying irrelevant scaling fields in the effective action become small as successive rg transformations drive the system to the fixed point .",
    "if the system is initially slightly off the critical surface , the direction of the rg flow of the relevant scaling fields will be away from the fixed point ( and hence the critical surface ) , while the direction of flow of the irrelevant scaling fields will be towards the fixed point .",
    "the relevant scaling fields must vanish on the critical surface .",
    "otherwise , rg transformations will take the system out of the critical surface .",
    "therefore , from a starting point sufficiently close to the critical surface , rg transformations first drive the system to the neighborhood of the fixed point , because the irrelevant operators dominate .",
    "the long distance behavior of the original critical region is thus seen to be the same as the long distance behavior in a neighborhood of the fixed point , since flow trajectories connect the two regions .",
    "eventually , the relevant scaling fields will drive the system away from the neighborhood of the fixed point .",
    "the rg also explains why the critical exponents of certain quantities are universal .",
    "their critical behavior can be analyzed in terms of the behavior near the fixed point .",
    "such quantities themselves obey transformation laws similar to those of the coupling parameters : @xmath47 one such quantity is the correlation length , whose scaling behavior is @xmath48 where @xmath46 are the relevant scaling fields and @xmath49 are the irrelevant scaling fields .",
    "the system is considered initially to have all the scaling fields except @xmath50 set to zero , and @xmath51 , since the initial point is very close to the critical surface . performing a transformation with @xmath52 ,",
    "one gets @xmath53 since @xmath54 , and @xmath55 for all @xmath56 , it follows that @xmath57 this means that the critical exponent for the correlation length with respect to the coupling @xmath50 is @xmath58 .",
    "the critical exponents of @xmath6 with respect to any other relevant coupling parameter can be obtained by starting with _ that _ coupling as the only non - zero relevant coupling parameter .",
    "the reason that the critical exponents are universal now emerges .",
    "the values of the critical exponents are generically determined by the eigenvalues of the linearized rg near the fixed point in the given universality class , and not by the values of the coupling parameters themselves .",
    "any system in a given universality class will therefore have the same critical exponents with respect to given relevant coupling parameters ( such as the temperature , the external field , etc . ) .",
    "numerical results for the nonlinear sigma models with noncompact configuration spaces demonstrate the need for a closer look at universality .",
    "nonlinear sigma models are a class of scalar field theories that can be obtained by imposing a constraint among a set of free massless scalar fields@xcite . the models are constructed to be invariant under the _ global _ transformations of some finite - dimensional lie group , @xmath59 .",

    "this difference , while not so drastic as the one for the magnetizations , appears to be another example of nonuniversal behavior .",

    ", the magnetization is defined to be @xmath137 ( with @xmath138 ) .",
    "plots of the magnetizations for the two lattice models described above are shown in fig .",
    "[ o21mag ] . for the geodesic model ,",
    "the @xmath3 dependence of the magnetization near the critical point is analytically soluble @xcite and has exponential behavior similar to that displayed by the geodesically differenced @xmath0 model . the model obtained by differencing ( [ o21action ] )",
    ", however , has a magnetization that displays the familiar power - law behavior near @xmath108 . for a lattice of @xmath139 sites",
    ", the magnetization behaves approximately as @xmath140 ( error estimates for this value are presently unavailable ) .",
    "again , there is a striking _ qualitative _ difference between the two lattice models .",
    "extensive numerical simulations of the geodesically - differenced @xmath1 model indicate clearly that this theory is trivial in the continuum limit @xcite .",
    "somewhat less thorough , but still convincing numerical studies for the naively - differenced theory @xcite suggest the that this theory is also trivial . in this respect , expectations from the ideas of universality appear to be fulfilled .",
    "nevertheless , the difference between magnetizations of the two lattice models remains to be explained .",
    "if there were a noncompact _ statistical mechanical model _",
    ", the difference would certainly be physically significant .",
    "the noncompact nonlinear sigma models discussed here clearly display behavior that would ordinarily be considered a violation of universality .",
    "one possible explanation for this behavior is that the different lattice theories are associated with different universality classes .",
    "this explanation , however , is difficult to reconcile with the renormalization group arguments about irrelevant operators , which suggest that the different lattice theories should have the same continuum limit .",
    "it was mentioned in secs .",
    "[ o11 ] and [ o21 ] that the numerical evidence supports ( to varying degrees ) the view that , as quantum field theories , these noncompact models are free ( trivial ) .",
    "this view is tenuous for the @xmath141 model ( the data is also consistent with a nontrivial continuum limit ) , but is well supported by numerical results for the @xmath2 theory .",
    "if it is true , it means that , under the action of the renormalization group , the different lattice theories flow to the gaussian fixed point .",
    "in such a case , it must be that the critical exponent for the magnetization is one of the quantities in the theory that does not behave in a universal fashion .",
    "this opposes a large body of evidence , but much of that has been obtained in the context of models with compact configuration spaces . to understand this nonuniversal behavior , examine the standard argument why the magnetization should have universal power law behavior near the critical point :    1 .",
    "[ rgrelation ] the critical lattice theory is connected by renormalization group transformations to another theory , which is at the fixed point .",
    "the theory at the fixed point has the same long - distance behavior as the original theory .",
    "[ couplingscale ] near a fixed point of the renormalization group transformation , the coupling constant @xmath3 will scale by some power of @xmath27 , @xmath142 .",
    "[ fieldscale ] the field will also scale by @xmath27 to some power , @xmath143 . since the magnetization is generally just @xmath144 , it picks up an overall factor of @xmath145 .",
    "[ magscale ] the above behavior leads to the relationship @xmath146 .",
    "this relationship implies @xmath147 .",
    "it is the third of the above statements that is false when applied to the magnetization of the lattice free field and the geodesic @xmath2 model . in those cases ,",
    "the magnetization is not just the average value of the field ; it does not scale in the same fashion as the field in the kinetic term of the action .",
    "this means that the factor of @xmath145 in front of the magnetization is not correct in this case , and the argument for a universal exponent fails .",
    "this should not affect the universality of other critical exponents in the theory , except perhaps those that are related to the exponent for the magnetization .",
    "the fact that the configuration spaces for these models are not compact plays a major role in the observed differences in critical behavior . in the action ( [ phiintegrand ] ) , the hyperbolic sine differs greatly from @xmath148 over the range of field values that contribute significantly to the integral ( recall that the fields which contribute to the functional integral are generally discontinuous @xcite ) .",
    "this causes the fields to spread over the configuration space at an exponential rate as @xmath149 , resulting in an average field which scales exponentially with @xmath3 , instead of with the usual power law .",
    "this type of scaling would be unlikely if the configuration space were compact , simply because a compact configuration space places a limit on the size of the fields .",
    "it may seem unusual that the local scaling of the fields can affect behavior that is normally considered to be due to long range correlations . while it is the long range correlations that cause the fields to align , the @xmath150 of the order parameter is influenced by the local scaling ( with @xmath3 ) properties of the field .",
    "for the sigma models discussed above , the local behavior is sufficiently different to cause qualitative differences in the behavior of the magnetization near the critical point .    in this sense ,",
    "the behavior of the magnetization is like that of the critical coupling ( or critical temperature ) .",
    "the value of the critical coupling is known to depend strongly on the local details of the lattice model ; it is not a universal quantity .",
    "the conclusion of this article is that , for some noncompact models , the same is true of the magnetization . in field theory , this magnetization is not an observable quantity , and its nonuniversal behavior should not affect the continuum theory .",
    "as noted in sec .",
    "[ univ ] , however , it is significant from the statistical mechanical viewpoint .",
    "regarding conclusions about the triviality of these models , there remains uncertainty about the continuum limit of the model defined by ( [ phiintegrand ] ) .",
    "more complete numerical simulations of this model are necessary before its continuum limit can be cited with conviction .",
    "in addition , it would be helpful to obtain an analytical approximation to this theory for small values of @xmath3 , similar to the one that supports the numerical data for the @xmath2 model @xcite .",
    "these tasks remain for future research .",
    "the authors wish to thank michael mandelberg for helpful conversations , and see kit foong for providing comments and numerical data .",
    "they are grateful to eric myers for sharing his numerical results for the @xmath0 model .",
