    "the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction in leading order corresponds to the one - pion - exchange potential ( opep ) plus a dirac - delta , when considering an effective field theory ( eft ) of nuclear forces based on a chiral expansion of the effective lagrangian .",
    "this procedure was suggested by weinberg  @xcite , with a recipe to infer the values of the strength of the dirac - delta interaction in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 channels from the singlet and triplet scattering lengths respectively .",
    "therefore , the singlet and triplet scattering lengths allows to fit the renormalized strengths of the contact interactions .",
    "this effective potential should be valid for momenta well below some typical momentum scale considered in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , such as the rho meson mass ( @xmath4 4 @xmath5 )  @xcite , which implies in a cutoff at the momentum scale of this order or below , for the intermediate virtual propagation of the nn system .    according to weinberg s recipe , one should use naive dimensional analysis ( nda ) to order terms in the potential , truncate it at a certain order , and then solve the lippmann - schwinger ( ls ) equation exactly .",
    "however , it has been shown that this recipe is not consistent with renormalization - group ( rg ) invariance , already at leading order  @xcite .",
    "the validity of weinberg s power counting is questioned  @xcite in particular for the waves like @xmath6 , where the singular and attractive pion tensor force is requiring more than two parameters even at lo .    about a decade ago",
    ", an alternative way to renormalize the nucleon - nucleon interaction , for a singular potential was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in an extension of @xcite ,",
    "the approach was proved in ref .",
    "@xcite to be rg invariant , as it satisfies the corresponding non - relativistic callan - symanzik equations  @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "no cutoff is considered in the equations and/or interactions .",
    "instead , it is introduced a subtraction point in the kernel of the lippmann - schwinger ( ls ) equation  @xcite , in order to reach a finite @xmath7matrix .",
    "our research group has considered singular contact interactions in the context of nuclear  @xcite , atomic and general physics  @xcite . in such works , within specific renormalization procedures applied to few - body systems , scaling limits and correlations between low - energy observables emerge as a consequence of using singular contact ( zero - range ) interactions .    as the approach was proved to be invariant under renormalization group transformations , after fitting the data",
    ", one can easily move the reference scale without affecting the physics .",
    "this flexibility in moving the reference scale is a big technical advantage of the present approach in relation to other ones .",
    "indeed , the renormalization results for the observables should be independent of the specific scheme used .",
    "our method was applied to the nn interaction with opep supplemented by contact interactions  @xcite .",
    "the significant results obtained by several authors in the implementation of the eft program for the two - nucleon system  @xcite include a vast literature on the predictive power of the leading order term ( opep plus delta ) with a single renormalization momentum scale .",
    "such calculation gave a sound basis for the renormalization program of eft in the nn system .",
    "in particular , the opep background to the nn observables were carefully analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "renormalization of the nn interaction in chiral effective theory in leading order ( lo ) , up to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , and to next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) , in s , p , d waves , has been done with success in coupled and uncoupled waves @xcite .",
    "the references @xcite apply the renormalization approach in coordinate space , while the works @xcite use subtracted - resolvent two - body techniques in momentum space .",
    "the subtracted renormalization procedure considered in refs .",
    "@xcite is essentially different from the one applied in refs .",
    "@xcite in the way to deal with the physical inputs introduced to heal the ultraviolet divergences . in short : in the renormalization strategy of @xcite , one - folded subtracted equation and also a cutoff are used , implying in a window where the observables are quite independent on the cutoff .",
    "the strategy of refs .",
    "@xcite is based on the elimination of ultraviolet divergences and relies on multiple subtractions , without any additional cutoff parameter .",
    "the multiple subtraction technique that we are going to use in the present approach demands a strategy to construct the driving term of the corresponding scattering equation , which is generated by consecutive subtractions in the kernel at some defined energy scale .",
    "we denote a generic order of subtractions in the kernel by @xmath8 , such that @xmath9 stands for one subtraction . with the assumption that we have only @xmath10wave lo contact interaction ,",
    "one subtraction is enough . in this case",
    "the subtraction scale is let to infinity and then driven towards a given finite value of the subtraction energy by solving a non - relativistic callan - symanzik ( nrcs ) equation  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding solution gives the lo driven term calculated at the reference subtraction energy where more contacts and tpe potentials are included .",
    "we introduce each order of the potential ( lo , nlo , nnlo ) in the driven term of the subtracted equation when the number of subtractions are enough to make it finite .",
    "for that , we use @xmath11 in case of nlo , and @xmath12 in nnlo .",
    "unitarity is strictly kept . in this regard",
    ", we note that the lowest contact of the @xmath13wave is introduced together with the tpep nnlo . in the complexity of this subject , to have different approaches to tame highly divergent potentials inherent to weinberg proposal , it is important to observe the coherence between the physical results obtained with higher order potentials and the corresponding contacts to learn subtle aspects of qcd that permeates the chiral effective expansion of the nuclear interaction . in other words , a trace of the qcd scale",
    "is expected to emerge in the fitting procedure for the nucleon - nucleon scattering data . and ,",
    "as we are going to verify in our approach , this relic can be found in the scale associated with the subtraction point where the two - pion exchange potential at nlo and nnlo are introduced in the renormalization process .    in the present work , going beyond the lo interaction and also considering @xmath13 and @xmath14partial waves , we show how to implement a multiple subtractive renormalization approach to obtain consistent results for the nn observables .",
    "we start by summarizing the methodology used to renormalize the nucleon - nucleon interaction using a recursive subtracted approach that was previously considered in ref .",
    "next , we present the equations to be solved in order to obtain a finite @xmath7matrix with nlo and nnlo interactions , taking into account partial waves up to @xmath0 .",
    "the results are fitted to low - energy experimental data .",
    "as it will be shown , the adjusted derivative contact terms dominates over the nlo and nnlo interactions in the @xmath10wave channels for momentum higher than about 1 @xmath5 .",
    "it is about the same , in the case of nonzero angular momentum . by including higher contact derivative terms",
    ", the potential is fitted to low energy phase - shifts up to about 200 mev laboratory energies .    as we have verified , the subtractive - renormalization technique considered in refs .",

    "these potentials have also been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in order to show that , we present results for the nucleon - nucleon phase - shifts up to @xmath0 , going beyond previous calculations within the present technique .",
    "we stress that our method can not be naively confused with a born approximation which , in principle , is not reliable for singular interactions . indeed",
    ", we show that the unitarity is strictly kept along all the subtractive procedure .",
    "moreover , it was already demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite that our multiple subtractive approach is fully renormalization - group ( rg ) invariant .",
    "we also show how to implement the multiple subtractive renormalization method for @xmath13waves with contact interactions , respecting the phase - shift threshold behavior of these waves . by considering that ,",
    "we supply the details not explicitly discussed in refs .",
    "actually , @xmath13wave channels were already studied in ref .",
    "@xcite with one subtraction and a sharp momentum cutoff ; and , in ref .",
    "@xcite ( and references therein ) , in coordinate space , even considering higher partial waves .",
    "the number of recursive steps required to renormalize the interaction depends on how the potential diverges .",
    "for instance , the leading order requires only one step , the next - to - leading order requires three steps and the next - to - next - to - leading order requires four steps .",
    "the method has been extended for a generic number of recursive steps @xcite and applied to one - pion exchange plus contact interactions with three steps  @xcite .",
    "our present renormalization technique can be used to organize and implement calculations where one - pion exchange is treated non - perturbatively .",
    "higher order terms from the chiral expansion of the nucleon - nucleon force can also be treated within this method .",
    "a further advantage of our method can be particularly appreciated in the @xmath2 and @xmath6 channels , in which we show the phase - shift behaviors for increasing cutoffs , exemplifying the cutoff independence as it goes to infinity . in conception ,",
    "our method differs from the works presented in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite which also dealt with simpler effective chiral expansion in the way suggested by weinberg .",
    "in other approaches , such as the one given by barford and birse  @xcite , the higher chiral order are evaluated in distorted - wave born approximation . however , in this case the analysis of the renormalization - group is quite involved . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was considered a systematic chiral procedure with a smooth cutoff applied to the potential in order to obtain the observables from the originally divergent scattering equations .",
    "it has also been suggested that subleading orders of the potential should not be fully iterated , but treated in ( distorted - wave ) perturbation theory ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) . in our approach , we can iterate to all orders the potential and still keep the renormalization group invariance .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly describe the subtractive formalism applied to the lippmann - schwinger equation , with the renormalization group equations .",
    "the formalism is followed by an analytical example where the rg equation is solved for the @xmath13wave case with contact interactions , where two subtractions are required . in section iii , the renormalization formalism is applied to the nnlo potential , by considering recursive renormalization processes .",

    "our conclusions are given in section v.",
    "the scattering equation can be written with an arbitrary number of subtractions @xmath15 in the kernel @xcite , that is useful when the potential has ultraviolet divergences with attractive nature e.g. @xmath16 with @xmath17 ( for @xmath18 the critical strength for collapsing the bound state is 1/4 ) , and/or the potential includes contact terms ( dirac delta and it s derivatives ) . by considering our units such that",

    "in addition , we remark a general feature of the subtraction procedure applied to attractive and repulsive power - law potentials in configuration space ( @xmath41 with @xmath17 ) . in the repulsive case",
    "the subtraction is not trivially required to render finite the @xmath7matrix , as the scattering wave function is damped in the classically forbidden region .",
    "in contrast , in the attractive case the ultraviolet divergence is actually met dynamically and may collapse the state .",
    "that is the case that a regularization has to be performed at the short range . in our method",
    "we deal with this problem , by using enough subtractions to make the @xmath7matrix finite .",
    "attractive and repulsive terms that we are discussing now appears as the chiral expansion is performed , as also discussed thoroughly by valderrama and arriola in their renormalization scheme in configuration space for calculation of the nn phase - shifts @xcite . instead ,",
    "in our approach , subtractions are introduced to include the contacts , at the expense of finding a convenient subtraction point with the meaning of a reference low - energy scale .",
    "as we will show , indeed the fitting of partial waves phase - shifts up to @xmath0 gives a reference subtraction energy between -50 and -100 mev . at this scale",
    "the nlo and nnlo tpep potentials are identified as contributions to the driving terms as we are going to explain in detail in sect .",
    "note that the reference subtraction point is , in principle , arbitrary , and can be moved by evolving the potential through the rg flow equation .",
    "once the fitting to the data is done , the reference scale can be changed arbitrarily as long as the driving term ( starting potential ) is evolved through the nonrelativistic callan - symanzik flow equation  @xcite .",
    "in fact , this implies that the rg invariance can not be separated from the form of the evolved interaction .",
    "next , we briefly discuss the rg equations , followed by an analytical example .",
    "the nucleon - nucleon observables are invariant under the change of the arbitrary subtraction point , therefore one can start at any convenient energy scale @xmath27 .",
    "however , the form of the driving term and its coefficients , which define the scattering amplitude are tied to the prescription used to define the renormalized theory .",
    "the key point of the renormalization group method is to change this prescription without altering the predictions of the theory  @xcite .",
    "the invariance of the @xmath7matrix under changes of renormalization prescriptions , i.e. , @xmath42 imposes a definite rule to modify @xmath28 that appears in a form of a non - relativistic callan - symanzik ( nrcs ) equation  @xcite :    @xmath43    which is derived from the invariance of @xmath44 , given by eq .",

    "similarly , the evolution of renormalization group equations as introduced by bogner , kuo and schwenk  @xcite for the nn scattering does not truncate on certain operators as the cutoff is varied to keep the observables unchanged .",
    "we illustrate the use of our multiple subtraction renormalization method by discussing the case of a one - channel @xmath13wave problem with a derivative contact interaction @xmath49 .",

    "it is gratifying to verify that our fittings with the associated subtraction point , given by the renormalization scale , comes to be about @xmath1 , well below the @xmath152meson mass .",
    "this is consistent with the general weinbergs@xcite suggestion , that an effective potential should be valid for momenta much smaller than a typical qcd scale of 1 gev , and the intermediate nucleon - nucleon propagation should be damped at such small momentum scale .",
    "we thank the brazilian agencies fundao de amparo  pesquisa do estado de so paulo ( fapesp ) and conselho nacional de desenvolvimento cientfico e tenolgico ( cnpq ) for partial support .",
    "v.s.t . would like to thank faepex / unicamp for partial support .",
    "we follow the definitions given in ref .",
    "@xcite for the nucleon - nucleon phase shifts and mixing parameters , which are appropriate to the case that we have coupled channels .",
