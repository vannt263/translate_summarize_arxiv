    "higher dimensional spacetime configuration is particularly important in the studies of the early phase of the universe .",
    "it plays a significant role to describe not only the universe in early stage of its evolution but also some unobservable phenomena in the physical universe .",
    "it is interesting to point out that barrow @xcite was the first to investigate the role of spacetime dimensions in determining the form of various physical laws and constants of nature .",
    "basically he @xcite employed the concept of fractal dimension under kaluza - klein theories obtained by dimensional reduction from higher dimensional gravity or supergravity theories .",
    "it has therefore been argued that the presently observed @xmath1 spacetime is the compactified form of manifold with higher dimensions and as such in the arena of grand unification theory and also in superstring theory this kind of self - compactification idea of multidimensions have been invoked by different researchers @xcite .",
    "there are also several other research articles available in the literature in connection to higher spatial dimensions some of which can be consulted in the following refs .",
    "@xcite .    in cosmology , the kaluza - klein inflationary theory with higher dimensions , it is believed that extra dimensions are reducible specially to four dimension which was associated with some physical processes .",
    "ishihara @xcite and later on gegenberg and das @xcite have shown that within the kaluza - klein inflationary scenario of higher dimension a contraction of the internal space causes the inflation of the usual space .",
    "it is argued by ibanz and verdaguer @xcite that there are cases in frw cosmologies where the extra dimensions contract as a result of cosmological evolution .",
    "it has been observed that symmetries of geometrical as well as physical relevant quantities of general relativity , known as collineations and conformal killing vectors ( ckv ) , are most useful to facilitate generation of exact solutions to the einstein field equations @xcite . since it is a key ingredient of the methodology of the present paper so we would like to add here a few more sentences in connection to collineations and conformal killing vectors .",
    "we note that a great details on conformal collineations ( a generalization of conformal killing vector fields and affine collineations and projective collineations ) that inherit the ricci curvature ( that is , preserve it up to a scalar factor ) have been analyzed on semi - riemannian manifolds with divergence - free riemannian curvature tensors by beem and duggal  @xcite .",
    "apostolopoulos and tsamparlis  @xcite argue that the proper ricci and matter ( inheritance ) collineations are the ( conformal ) killing vectors of the generic metric which are not ( conformal ) killing vectors of the space - time metric and using this observation they compute the ricci and matter inheritance collineations of the robertson - walker space - times and we determine the ricci and matter collineations without any further calculations . however , this conformal ricci and matter collineations technique has been employed for an anisotropic fluid  @xcite .",
    "there are some other notable works on collineations and conformal killing vectors available in the following refs .",
    "@xcite .    therefore , in the present investigation following yavuz et al .",
    "@xcite , we have imposed the condition that the spacetime manifold admits a ckv and thus tried to tackle the anisotropic field equations in a suitably better way .    in connection to the anisotropic field equations of general relativity",
    "the study of compact objects has been of ample interest for a long time .",
    "it was argued long ago by bowers and liang @xcite that the effects of local anisotropy may have important role for relativistic fluid spheres to attain hydrostatic equilibrium in connection to maximum equilibrium mass and surface redshift .",
    "ruderman @xcite showed that in the stellar interior the nuclear matter may have anisotropic features at least in certain very high density ranges ( @xmath2 ) and thus advocated to treat the nuclear interaction relativistically .",
    "very recently , based on some observed compact stars kalam et al .",
    "@xcite made an extensive analysis to show the anisotropic behavior of the samples .",
    "therefore , under the above theoretical background our motivation is indeed to study stability problem and dimensional constraint in connection to solutions of higher dimensional spherically symmetric systems within the framework of noncommutative geometry .",
    "the present investigation thus based on the following scheme : after providing the basic field equations of einstein in the sec .",
    "ii , we seek the solutions under ckv in sec .",
    "iii for various dimensions ranging from @xmath3 to @xmath4 spacetime .",
    "iv deals with active gravitational mass where we get indication for minimum potential energy at @xmath1 spacetime . therefore , in sec .",
    "v we continue our investigation by imposing equilibrium conditions and arrive at the conclusion that higher dimensional spacetime is not tenable for stability of the system . sec .",
    "vi offers some concluding remarks in favor of the results obtained .",
    "the spacetime metric describing a spherically symmetric system in higher dimension is taken as @xmath5 where the line element @xmath6 on the unit @xmath7-sphere is given by @xmath8    the general energy momentum tensor which is compatible with static spherically symmetry as @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
    "the einstein equations ( for the geometrized units @xmath11 ) are @xmath12    @xmath13    @xmath14 -\\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2r^2}=8\\pi p_t,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are respectively the energy density , radial pressure and tangential pressure of the static fluid sphere . here",
    "@xmath18 over @xmath19 and @xmath20 denotes partial derivative w.r.t .",
    "radial coordinate @xmath21 only .",
    "the energy density having a minimal spread gaussian profile in higher dimension is taken as @xcite @xmath22 here , @xmath23 is the total mass of the source which can be diffused throughout a region of linear dimension @xmath24 due to the uncertainty and generally assumed to be closed to the planck length scale .",
    "to find the exact solution , as is indicated in the introductory part , we use the well known inheritance symmetry of the spacetime as the symmetry under conformal killing vectors @xcite given as : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is an arbitrary function of @xmath21 .    the above conformal killing eqs .",
    "( [ ckv ] ) provide the following set : @xmath27 where the subscript of comma denotes the partial derivative w.r.t .",
    "@xmath21 . here in the second expression @xmath28 s are involved , however being constant we have taken those as @xmath29 .    these eqs .",
    "( 9 ) - ( 12 ) imply @xmath30    @xmath31    @xmath32    where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are integration constants . the above eqs .",
    "( [ nu ] ) - ( [ xi ] ) contain all the characteristic features derived from the existence of the conformal collineation .",
    "now , using the values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 from eqs .",
    "( [ nu ] ) and ( [ lam ] ) , we can solve the field equations for the given energy density ( [ density1 ] ) , i.e. we try to find out here the unknowns @xmath26 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 under different space - time with varying value of @xmath7 , the index of dimension . as a sample study",
    "we only consider cases with @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 representing @xmath3 , @xmath1 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath4 spacetime respectively .      starting this case of lower space - time with @xmath35 ,",
    "the metric potential can be given by @xmath42 where @xmath29 is an integration constant as mentioned earlier . here in the above expression @xmath28 in the numerator and as multiplier in the denominator are i m posed manually and can be taken as unity for simplicity .",
    "here the pressures are taking the forms : @xmath43    @xmath44    in a similar way , by applying the boundary conditions at @xmath45 , i.e. @xmath46 , at once we get @xmath47      our interior metric is @xmath48 we match our interior solution to the exterior btz metric given by @xmath49    so the matching conditions yield the following results : @xmath50    if we now put the value of @xmath29 from eq . (",
    "19 ) , we get @xmath51 which is clearly impossible .",
    "therefore , three dimensional fluid inspired by non commutative geometry admitting conformal killing vector is not physically viable .",
    "this is the usual @xmath1 space - time and in this case the metric potential can be given by @xmath52,\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the error function .",
    "therefore , the radial and tangential pressure parameters , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , now are respectively taking the following forms : @xmath54    @xmath55    at the boundary surface ( @xmath45 ) pressure should be considered as of vanishing order ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "thus we get the value of the constant @xmath57 as @xmath58.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      in the present case our metric : @xmath59    on the other hand , @xmath1 metric is schwarzschild metric and can be supplied as @xmath60    so matching conditions provide us the following expressions for the constant quantities : @xmath61      let us now move towards higher dimension by choosing the value of @xmath62 .",
    "the metric potential , the radial and tangential pressures for this @xmath40 space - time can respectively be given by @xmath63,\\ ] ]    @xmath64    @xmath65    at @xmath45 , @xmath66 and that gives @xmath67 .",
    "our metric in this case is @xmath68    again , the @xmath40 schwarzschild metric is @xmath69    so matching conditions on the boundary immediately give us : @xmath70        @xmath72    @xmath73    at @xmath45 , @xmath74 and it provides @xmath75      we would like to study one more higher dimensional case with @xmath39 . in this chosen case of @xmath4 space - time ,",
    "the metric potential and pressure parameters take the forms : @xmath76,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath77    @xmath78    at @xmath45 , @xmath56 and we get @xmath79",
    "we apply the following relation to calculate active gravitational mass in various dimensions @xcite @xmath80 r^{n}\\rho(r)dr.\\ ] ]     ( as vertical axis ) with spacetime dimensions @xmath7 ( as horizontal axis ) is drawn . in the figure specifically we have used the numerical values @xmath81 , @xmath82  km and @xmath83 to plot @xmath84 vs @xmath7 graph .",
    "it is evident from the fig .",
    "1 that the function @xmath84 increases in a blowing up manner as the number of dimensions increases except at the @xmath1 spacetime which has a minimum value . ]    now before drawing any conclusion from the above expression for mass , let us first see what is the lesson to be extracted from this study for our understanding of possible properties of different static and spherically symmetric fluid distribution .",
    "this obviously can be done through a systematic survey of the effect of higher dimensional spacetime for the different parameter set that fit for the observed stars .",
    "we have collected data for the masses of some compact objects , e.g. psr j1614 - 2230 [ @xmath85 @xcite ] , psr j1903 + 327 [ @xmath86 @xcite ] , vela x-1 [ @xmath87 @xcite ] , smc x-1 [ @xmath88 @xcite ] and cen x-3 [ @xmath89 @xcite ] .",
    "the corresponding radii have been calculated by takisa et al .",
    "@xcite which respectively are as follows : 10.30  km , 9.82  km , 9.99  km , 9.13  km and 9.51  km ( also see the refs .",
    "@xcite for other data set for different compact stars ) .    keeping in mind the above range of masses and radii ,",
    "let us then realistically consider the following specific physical configuration of any compact star : + with the numerical values @xmath81 , @xmath82  km and @xmath83 , from a straight forward calculation , we get @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 for the dimensions @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath0 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 respectively .",
    "it is very interesting to note from the fig .",
    "1 that the function @xmath84 increases in a blowing up manner as the number of dimensions increases but it has only one minimum at the @xmath1 spacetime .",
    "there is also a small hump visible at @xmath3 spacetime .",
    "this means that noncommutative geometry admitting conformal killing vectors with anisotropic fluid sphere permit only the @xmath0-dimensional spacetime to make the spherically symmetric matter distribution in stable equilibrium .",
    "in view of the above result and discussion we are then in demand of verifying the equilibrium features of the spherically symmetric matter distribution . the active gravitational mass , for the present case , can be given by @xmath105 where @xmath106    now equilibrium of the spherical symmetric system requires the following condition : @xmath107 where @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 are respectively the gravitational , hydrostatic and anisotropic forces .",
    "let us then provide the forces in action , i.e. gravitational , hydrostatic and anisotropic , respectively as follows : @xmath111,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath112,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath113.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    .",
    "it is to be noted from the figure that due to the joint action of @xmath114 and @xmath115 against @xmath116 the system becomes stable at @xmath1 ]    even though the differential eq .",
    "( 49 ) for @xmath116 has not been worked out , yet one can draw information from eq . (",
    "47 ) to have a primary conclusion . by using maple we actually are able to plot without writing the derivative in analytical form",
    "thus , as far as the fig .",
    "2 is concerned , we observe that @xmath115 is the most dominant factor whereas the least one is @xmath114 .",
    "moreover , at lower dimension the joint action of @xmath114 and @xmath115 is much more than @xmath116 so that the system becomes unstable . on the other hand ,",
    "as we approach towards @xmath1 they balance each other and thus make a stable configuration .",
    "the analysis done in the foregoing section immediately indicates that at @xmath0-dimension only one can get a stable configuration for any spherically symmetric stellar system as such higher dimension becomes untenable as far as the stability of a system is concerned . in a study on higher dimensional framework of noncommutative geometry farook",
    "@xcite , replace pointlike structures with smeared objects and have found that wormhole solutions exist in the usual four , as well as in five dimensions also ( only in a very restricted region ) , but they do not exist in higher - dimensional spacetime .",
    "however , it is now an open question whether the above remark is true for a noncommutative geometry admitting conformal killing vectors or in any geometry this becomes feasible . in this connection",
    "we note that farook et al . @xcite studied a generalized schwarzschild spacetime with higher dimensions and performed a survey",
    "whether higher dimensional schwarzschild spacetime is compatible with some of the solar system phenomena . as a sample test they examined four well known solar system effects , viz . , ( 1 ) perihelion shift , ( 2 ) bending of light , ( 3 ) gravitational redshift , and ( 4 ) gravitational time delay .",
    "it has been shown by them that under a @xmath118-dimensional solutions of schwarzschild type very narrow class of metrics the results related to all these physical phenomena are mostly incompatible with the higher dimensional version of general relativity .    in this",
    "regard a special point is to mention that in the present paper we deal only with spherical distributions .",
    "therefore a obvious question may arise : what about possible departures from sphericity .",
    "it is well known that multipoles play relevant roles as can be noticed in several cases of practical interests , ranging from tests of fundamental physics in the field of stars , planets with crafts , to black holes and stellar systems used to probe their properties  @xcite .",
    "so , it would be important to see what happens to such kind of non - spherical distributions in more or less than 4-dimensions is a pertinent issue which will be the subject of further researches in our future projects .",
    "same remarks holds also for the influence of the rotation in a kerr / lense - thirring - like way : does the angular momentum of the source influence the results , and , if so , to what extent ?",
    "we note that there are several such investigations in different context  @xcite . therefore",
    ", this problem may also be an issue of another future study .    as a final comment we would like to add here that a much more deep and comprehensive studies are required before offering a concluding remark in connection to stability of a spherically symmetric fluid distribution at @xmath1 only .",
