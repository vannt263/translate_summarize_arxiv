    "biochemical reaction systems are usually conceptualized as dynamical systems - systems that evolve in continuous time and may or may not receive additional input to the system .",
    "mathematically , this can be expressed by sets of ordinary differential equations ( ode ) , such that rates of concentration changes correspond to mass - action kinetic parameters @xcite . in this paper",
    "we use existing mass - action dynamical systems to propose an alternate or additional framework for modeling and interpretation of biochemical reaction systems .",
    "we provide an algebraic analysis of biochemical reaction systems as a matrix of concentrations for all species , given certain input concentrations .",
    "these concentrations correspond to steady - state amounts which are reached after a delay time , and the delay times can be measured by the system as well .",
    "we use an arbitrary published model @xcite as an example for a ode dynamical model of biochemical reactions .",
    "the model simulates intracellular signal transduction from receptor binding to molecular targets in different cellular compartments , as an important component in the long - term regulation of protein expression implied in neural and synaptic plasticity . in striatal neurons , both a calcium - dependent pathway and a camp - dependent pathway",
    "are activated during the initiation of neural plasticity by nmda / ampa receptors and neuromodulator receptors such as dopamine d1 receptors @xcite .",
    "their effects and the integration of signaling on common targets such as kinases and phosphatases have been the subject of a number of computational models @xcite .",
    "in particular , the role of the darpp-32 protein in striatal neurons in determining the outcome of membrane signaling has been modeled by different groups , based on a common set of experimental data @xcite , cf .",
    "many similar models @xcite have been developed in the last 10 - 12 years in different areas of biology . models with dozens or more of species have up to a 100 or more equations and are consequently complex and difficult to understand as continuous dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "a transformation into a matrix - based formulation of input - output functions , even at the cost of a loss of fast dynamical modeling , promises considerable gain of insight and access to a different set of mathematical tools .",
    "simple mass - action kinetic models may be criticized for disregarding the real complexity of spatio - temporal molecular interactions .",
    "some alternatives use spatial grids and stochastic versions of biochemical reactions to capture this complexity @xcite .",
    "however , certain variations , such as compartmental modeling with diffusion , altered kinetics for anchored proteins , or employing molecular kinetics as the basis for binding constants may be employed within the mass - action kinetic framework to achieve better correspondence with the biological reality .",
    "these variations can be directly transferred to the proposed model as well .    in our approach",
    ", we identify input nodes , and then pre - compute the outcomes for all internal species ( target species ) in response to biological meaningful ranges and combinations of inputs .",
    "this allows to analyze a biochemical reaction system under all possible input conditions .",
    "the analysis can be done for arbitrary ode models @xcite , provided minimal requirements on conservation properties are realized ( cf .",
    "section `` methods '' , @xcite ) .",
    "the results are stored as vectors or matrices ( systemic protein signaling functions ( psfs ) ) and can be fitted with functional parameters .",
    "it is an important aspect of the model that computations are done systemically . in section `` elementary biochemical reactions '' ,",
    "source - target interactions are first analyzed in isolation ( elementary psfs ) .",
    "they all constitute hyperbolic saturation functions , therefore rate parameters can be uniformly translated into functional parameters for signal transmission strength .",
    "but in a systemic context , source - target interactions change because of additional influences on the species from other equations in the system ( section `` systemic psf analysis '' ) .",
    "therefore a fitted systemic psf from a to b is different from the elementary psf .",
    "the pre - computed , systemic psfs may be used to create state - change simulation models , i.e. discrete - time models , which can be compared with continuous ode models ( section `` systemic delay and state - change dynamics '' ) .",
    "what is significant and novel about our analysis is that we can extract systemic transfer functions from the complex system , and thereby dissect the system into parts .",
    "we can analyze the transmission properties of individual species , compare their minimum and maximum values , and the functional shape of their transmission strength .",
    "specifically , we can show under which circumstances a link is functional , i.e. actually transmits information ( section `` computing input - dependent modularity '' ) .    the analysis has a number of restrictions .",
    "an important restriction is that our model does not allow for analysis of fast interactions below the resolution of settling into steady - state .",
    "the requirement of conservation of mass guarantees that for each input concentrations will eventually settle to some equilibrium value , but due to the prevalence of feedback interactions , they may still produce transients or dampened oscillations .",
    "this means that fast fluctuations of input will not be adequately simulated using pre - computed psf functions alone .",
    "it is then necessary to refer to the underlying ode model .",
    "the model is most suitable for studying disease states , pharmacological interventions , genetic manipulations , mirna interference , or any system conditions which fundamentally alter the presence or concentration of molecular species .",
    "these conditions may then be tested either in steady - state or with a sequence of sufficiently slow input constellations .",
    "a second restriction is that the model inherits parameter uncertainty from mass - action kinetic models .",
    "these parameters are derived from experimental measurements , but typically with a high degree of uncertainty @xcite .",
    "our analysis offers a clear distinction between elementary and systemic functional parameters and explains why experimental measurements are so highly dependent on the systemic context . in this paper , we have treated elementary parameters as given by the underlying model @xcite . in principle , systemic functional interactions can be measured experimentally , and in the model each interaction can be adjusted separately .",
    "this may offer a novel theoretical approach towards finding adequate elementary rate parameters .",
    "a biochemical reaction system formulation for signal transduction contains two different types of reactions :    1 .   complex formation + @xmath0+[b ] \\leftrightarrow [ ab]$ ] 2 .",
    "enzymatic reactions + @xmath0+[e]\\leftrightarrow [ ae ] \\rightarrow [ a*]+e$ ] .",
    "the system has concentrations for species a , b and e ( a * , ae and ab can be calculated ) , a set of kinetic rate parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 for the forward and backward binding reactions in complex formation , and @xmath3 for the rate of enzymatic production .",
    "the equational structure , the kinetic parameters and the initial concentrations of the model @xcite are reproduced in tables  [ kimbl1 ] , [ kimbl2 ] , [ kimbl3 ] , [ kimbl4 ] , with slight modifications : equation 40 was added to close the loop from amp to atp and thus provide for conservation of all molecules in the system .",
    "conservation of mass is necessary in order for all species to reach equilibrium .",
    "it means that for any forward reaction there needs to be a reverse reaction , such that any species receives both input and output ( weakly reversible system , cf .",
    "this implies that pure loss reactions , like endocytosis or diffusion across the cell membrane ( secretion ) can not adequately be modeled with this system , unless balancing reactions are added which make up for the loss .",
    "e.g. , for endocytosis of a ligand - bound receptor , both the ligand and the receptor , possibly independently , have to be recycled , which means that bridging equations for receptor - ligand dissolution in the endocytosed state , and input rates for receptors and ligands have to be added .",
    "secondly , the species pp1 and its interactions ( 4 equations ) were left out , since they contain a complex which dissolves into its 3 components in one step : this would require a , fairly trivial , addition to the current psf system implementation .",
    "the system can be depicted as a bipartite graph with nodes for species and nodes for reactions .",
    ".reactions in the camp pathway [ cols= \" > , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     from a biological perspective , this table provides an important test on the validity of the model . in many cases ,",
    "systemic delays can be measured .",
    "for instance , the delay for pkac at 150 - 250s rather than 30 - 60s , as measured in @xcite ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , seems large and may be an indication for a revision of the underlying parameters . from the theoretical perspective",
    ", this system seems to operate on separate time scales : 1 - 10s , 150 - 300s and 450 - 600s .",
    "such a separation of reactions by their characteristic delay times is interesting , since it could lead to simulation models with different discrete time scales .",
    "here we may calculate psf values for fast species with 10s time resolution , for intermediate species with 300s time resolution , and for slow species with 600s time resolution , i.e. system update time for state changes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f910]a , b ) .",
    "it is an empirical question , whether separate time scales rather than a continuum of delay values will prove to be an organizing principle in protein signaling systems @xcite . a general study , for instance , using models from the biomodels database @xcite , might give answers to this question .",
    "time scale separation may provide a conservative property of a signaling system against fluctuations of concentrations . if total concentrations in the system change , e.g. by protein expression up- or down regulation , mirna interaction , or diffusional processes across compartments , the relevant interactions will continue within each time slice .",
    "concerted regulation of protein expression levels may set a clock for the rapidity of signal transduction .",
    "systemic dynamics , in contrast to elementary reaction dynamics , need not follow a hyperbolic curve . if there are feedbacks in the system , the dynamics may contain transients , i.e. the concentration may be higher or lower before it settles into its steady - state value @xcite .",
    "the dynamic response of target species to input are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : f910]a , b . for a species without a transient response ,",
    "the actual value of a species at a shorter delay is always bounded by the steady - state value , and all possible concentrations in a continuous - time dynamical system are bounded by the psf concentration range @xcite . however ,",
    "if there are transients , a psf - based dynamical simulation will miss these transients and plot a simplified trajectory .",
    "this means that results from a psf analysis with slow inputs can not be extrapolated to much faster input dynamics - in contrast to continuous - timed dynamical systems where arbitrary time units can be chosen .",
    "this restriction may capture a biological reality : steady - state behavior provides the framework and may operate according to rules and principles which are separate from the effects of short term fluctuations .",
    "the psf system allows to generate a dynamical system as a sequence of states defined by fluctuations of input .",
    "[ fig : f910]c , d shows an overlay of a differential equation simulation and psf state change simulation for a sequence of inputs with 10s duration .",
    "accordingly , the psf approximation is excellent for all species with a delay time of @xmath4 .",
    "if we plot psf values for slow species at intervals corresponding to their maximal delays , we may linearly interpolate between points , and in this case achieve a good approximation of the continuous - time model .",
    "a psf - based dynamical system is an important tool in order to generate a time - series simulation from a calculated model system for comparison with experimental data .",
    "the psf system utilizes parameters which are uniform and have linear error ranges ( cf .",
    "[ fig : f1234]a , c ) , and therefore should improve interaction of the model with the experimental reality .",
    "the psf model will also allow to predict the optimal stimulation times for different inputs such that responses can be measured in steady - state .",
    "since we are able to define signal transmission capacity , we have a tool to investigate modularity of a signaling system .",
    "as species saturate or return to basal levels , they act as inactive links , i.e. they are stuck at the same concentration value , and can not transmit further increases or decreases of inputs .",
    "we hypothesize that this effect is actually important in many protein signaling systems .",
    "we may define an inactive connection as a species node which has only limited ( e.g. @xmath5 ) signal transmission capacity .",
    "the interconnectedness of a system is then proportional to the number of inactive connections , and a module is a part of the system with few or no active connections to the rest of the system .    in the following",
    "we discuss the activation / inactivation of links with respect to input increases .",
    "i.e. given a certain level of extracellular signaling , what happens if this level is raised and then kept at the higher level for some time , sufficient for the system to settle into a new steady state ? which species nodes",
    "will respond to the increase and transmit it to downstream targets , and which species will become saturated and only respond with their saturated value ?",
    "it is also clear that species which have become saturated ( inactive ) will not respond to fast extracellular signals anymore .",
    "this analysis is therefore useful both for the steady - state context and for understanding fast input fluctuations .",
    "there is an input level for each target species , where the species ceases to be responsive to further input increases .",
    "if that input level has been reached , the species can be considered to have become an inactive connection , i.e. a node which does not transmit signals .",
    "we may define systemic psfs for input - target psfs from the input to any target species ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kimbl_psf_ec90_1 ] ) .",
    "we notice how number of steps in the computation of a species concentration relates to a lower cut - off value for signal transmission ( e.g. dad1r , ac5goagtp , camp vs. pkac , pthr34 , pthr75 ) . in other words ,",
    "earlier steps in the sequence saturate at a higher input level than later steps .",
    "two parallel targets ( pthr34 , pp2ap ) of an intermediate step ( pkac ) may saturate at very different input levels ( @xmath6 for pthr34 vs. @xmath7 for pp2ap ) .",
    "this mechanism demonstrates the effect of a sequence of saturating functions , and constitutes a general principle in the construction of a signal transduction system .",
    "the model allows to study whether a node responds to a specific input with any change of steady - state . in fig .",
    "[ fig : f1213 ] and supplemental figures  [ suppl : f1 ] , [ suppl : f2 ] , we show modularization of the system under various da and ca input conditions . with da input and high ca ( figure  [ fig : f1213]b ) , species which are proximal to da input , the receptor - ligand complex dad1r , the signaling complex through g proteins and adenylyl cyclase ac5 , as well as camp , are most responsive to da over a large range of input .",
    "species in the integration zone between da and ca , such as darpp-32 , pp2a cease responding to da increases at lower levels and become inactive links at higher levels .",
    "species in the system with no significant change in concentration at any input level are for the most part proximal to ca instead of da , and thus highlight modularity among pathways . in this case , we see that da inputs are transmitted to distant targets only up to an intermediate range and that there are a significant number of species which do not react to da at all . above that range , even though closely coupled targets still respond to the input , the signal increase is not registered beyond camp production and synthesis . with ca low ( supplemental figure  [ suppl : f1 ] )",
    "there is widespread responsivity to da up to 1 - 2@xmath8 m and only a few of the calcium - related species do not respond at all .",
    "the da signal is therefore able to influence the calcium - related pathway , provided calcium is low .    when ca is the input ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f1213]a ) , the calcium - responsive proteins like calmodulin , camkii , calcium - activated pp2b ( calcineurin ) transmit signals , while the gpcr pathway remains almost completely unresponsive .",
    "there is some signal integration with calmodulin - activated pde1 for camp .",
    "other than that , we see that pp2ac and the pthr34 variant of darpp-32 respond strongest to calcium while pp2ap and the pthr75 variant of darpp-32 have less or no responsiveness to calcium . with da low , as in supplemental figure  [ suppl : f2 ] , again , most of the gpcr - related species do not respond to ca at all , or cease responding at 10 - 25% of maximal ca ( 1 - 4@xmath8 m )",
    ". however ca - related species like calmodulin , camkii , pp2b remain responsive .",
    "the difference between the high and low da condition is small . here",
    "the few existing links from ca to gpcr ( such as ca regulation of ac5 ) are not strong enough to influence the gpcr pathway significantly in any condition . in this case",
    ", it is not just the saturation that matters , the input signal has limited reach in influencing distant species in general .    we are analyzing a biological system with two pathways , the camp and the calcium pathway , which are cross - linked in a convergence zone of species which are influenced by both pathways .",
    "it is remarkable how clearly three different modules appear : the gpcr / camp pathway , the ca pathway , and the signal integration zone .",
    "there is also a general observation to be made about signal transmission in a protein signaling system : signal integration is strongest when inputs are low .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the effect of coupling saturating nodes .",
    "it means that there are few saturating species in the system which impose modularity , and signals spread further .",
    "widespread interconnectedness is only possible at low input levels . because activation curves for biochemical reactions are mostly uniform hyperbolic ( saturating ) , a stronger modularization with many inactive links results from higher input levels",
    "this may also have implications on transient responses .",
    "for instance , phosphatase and kinase response often differs with kinases being saturated only at higher input levels . if and where that is the case , we may observe transient responses that only reflect kinase activity , since phosphatases are saturated and do not participate in signaling , they do not add or subtract and in this way obscure the kinase signal .",
    "this shows that the steady - state input - response system may work well as the framework wherein fluctuating signaling operates .",
    "continuous dynamical systems - systems that use change over time as a system primitive - are notoriously difficult to analyze and may not be the best choice of a tool for signal transduction systems of moderate or large size .",
    "steady - state matrix computations are simple and fast , scale well to very large sizes , and offer multiple opportunities for analysis . by calculating transfer functions from a systemic dynamical model , we also gain the opportunity to extract and analyze parts of the system .",
    "this may help in creating re - usable system parts .",
    "this paper demonstrated a transformation of a mass - action kinetic biochemical reaction model implemented by a set of differential equations into an input - response transfer function model .",
    "the transformation is done by calculating steady - state concentrations for each species in response to a range of input values , and then analyzing the resulting vectors ( matrices ) as the basis of a transfer function ( psf ) . for small , toy - like networks of few components ,",
    "such dose - response relationships have been investigated by @xcite .",
    "they analyse kinetic models in the same way , however , they do nt make a distinction between parameters in elementary interactions , and the actual parameters in a systemic context .",
    "they also do not address the question of temporal embedding of the dose - response relations . in our approach ,",
    "we use dose - response functions , similar to hill functions , but we are extending the concept . by using rectangular signals , i.e. constant signaling levels ,",
    "we calculate the response as the steady - state value .",
    "in addition , we calculate the time to steady - state from the underlying dynamical model . only because of this additional computation can one attempt to create a discrete dynamical model  something that is not within the purview of a hill equation model .",
    "hill equations attempt to fit or create systemic parameters , which are different from elementary parameters , i.e. they do recognize the dependence of the transfer function on the systemic context .",
    "the psf model is an approach of making hill equations ( dose - response relations ) work in large - scale modeling .",
    "there are numerous attempts to simplify dynamical models in the temporal domain by creating hybrid models ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "sometimes slow interactions are regarded as constant , and only fast interactions are dynamically modeled .",
    "sometimes , fast interactions are replaced by time - independent values and only slow interactions are dynamically modeled ( many examples , for instance @xcite ) .",
    "there are also attempts to replace an ode model by a delay - differential equation ( dde ) model , i.e. to compute and use explicit time delays and eliminate many intermediate species , simplifying the size of the model @xcite .",
    "in our approach , time and concentration are regarded as separate , which makes it different from any hybrid approach .",
    "the main restriction is the assumption of a constant signaling level over periods of time sufficient to induce steady - state .",
    "the approach is therefore best suited to check the limiting conditions of a dynamical model , e.g. in drug development applications , where multiple dose - response relations derived from the model can be cross - checked and used to locally improve the model .",
    "however , the simple , atemporal transfer functions can also be applied directly : ( a ) in experimental settings where signal duration can be controlled , and ( b ) in physiological settings , when fluctuations occur around different mean values , and we model the step changes for the mean extracellular signaling level , but not the short - term fluctuations .",
    "it could be shown that psfs are sufficient to create discrete time dynamical models , with certain restrictions on fast dynamical inputs below the time resolution of the system .",
    "the primary focus of the analysis was on single - input systems , where signaling functions can be matched by parameterized hyperbolic functions .",
    "we showed how the analysis can be extended to multiple - input systems by computing and analyzing psf transfer matrices .",
    "the psf functions allow to cut through the complexity of the model and examine interactions in a localized way .",
    "if continuous dynamical models are being used with the goal of adequately simulating cellular processes , this kind of analysis is an indispensable tool to check for the consequences of the modeling assumptions in terms of dose - response relationships .",
    "the analytical tools of the psf approach may also be used to systematically investigate the effect of localized changes to the system @xcite , and to offer local corrections to the complex system in a transparent way .",
    "the extraction of input - target psfs with characteristic hyperbolic saturating properties allows to determine input level dependent inactivation of a species node .",
    "accordingly , we can define the limits of signal transmission by the distribution of inactive nodes . in the example system ,",
    "a strong distinction of calcium- and camp - dependent pathways and a signal integration zone were revealed .",
    "we could see that at low levels of input , widespread interactions are possible , while at higher levels of input , many species enter into a state of a constant function value and become inactive links .",
    "this corresponds to biological results and expectations , and provides a foundation for the concept of pathways in signal transduction . for transient responses ,",
    "the steady - state input - response system provides the boundary values to which the system eventually settles .",
    "this is especially interesting if we have saturating response levels , which are unresponsive to further signaling ( e.g. phosphatases ) , and allow transient signals ( e.g. kinases ) to emerge .",
    "signal transduction may also be analyzed from the perspective of rational system design .",
    "such work is still in its infancy .",
    "we may for instance investigate the effect of negative feedback links on concentration ranges and times to steady state",
    ". another question would be the optimization of a signal transduction system for the trade - off between speed and efficacy of signal transmission . with this choice of model",
    ", many new questions can be raised , and old problems like parameter dependency , modularity or signal integration can be addressed in a novel way .",
