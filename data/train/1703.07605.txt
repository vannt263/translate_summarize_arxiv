    "urface plasmon effects in gold nanoparticles is a physical phenomena that has been observed in colored glass objects since ancient times @xcite .",
    "the most fascinating and useful features of the plasmonic resonances in metal nanoparticles is first of all the mere existence of these resonances that may occur at free - space wavelengths that are many order of magnitudes larger than the structure itself , and secondly ( and contrary to intuition ) that the corresponding resonance frequencies are virtually independent of the size of the particles ( if they are sufficiently small ) , but does depend on its shape and orientation , see _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite . today",
    ", new theory and applications of plasmonics are constantly being explored in technology , biology and medicin .",
    "the topic includes the study of surface plasmonic resonances in small structures of various shapes , possibly embedded in different media , see _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite .",
    "the present study is restricted to passive surrounding materials , but future applications of plasmonics may even include amplifying ( active ) media as described in _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite .",
    "the classical theories as well as most of the recent studies on plasmonic resonance effects are concerned with metal nanoparticles and photonics where the exterior domain is lossless , see _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite .",
    "there are very few results developed for absorption and plasmonic resonance effects in particles or structures surrounded by lossy media . as _",
    "e.g. _ , in @xcite is given geometry independent absorption bounds for the plasmonic resonances in metal nanoparticles in vacuum , and an indication is given about how their results can be extended to lossy surrounding media .",
    "there exists a general mie theory for the electromagnetic power absorption in small spherical particles surrounded by lossy media , with explicit expressions and asymptotic formulas for the corresponding absorption cross section , see _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite .",
    "even though these formulas are derived for spherical geometry , they are in general quite complicated and difficult to interpret .",
    "however , as will be demonstrated in this paper , a new simplified formula for the absorption cross section can be derived which is valid for small ellipsoidal particles embedded in lossy media , and which facilitates a definition of the corresponding optimal plasmonic resonance .",
    "a new potentially interesting application area for the plasmonic resonance phenomena is with the electrophoretic heating of gold nanoparticle suspensions as a radiotherapeutic hyperthermia based method to treat cancer @xcite . in particular ,",
    "gold nanoparticles ( gnps ) can be coated with ligands ( nutrients ) that target specific cancer cells as well as providing a net electronic charge of the gnps @xcite .",
    "the hypothesis is that when a localized , charged gnp suspension has been taken up by the cancer cells , it will facilitate an electrophoretic current and a heating that can destroy the cancer under radio or microwave radiation , and this without causing damage to the normal surrounding tissues @xcite .",
    "hence , the potential medical application at radio or microwave frequencies provides a motivation for studying optimal plasmonic resonances in lossy media .",
    "however , it is also important to consider the complexity of this clinical application with many possible physical and biophysical phenomena to take into account , including cellular properties and their influence on the dielectric spectrum @xcite , as well as thermodynamics and heat transfer , see _ e.g. _ , @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to note that several authors have questioned whether metal nanoparticles can be heated in radio frequency at all , see _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite . based on the above mentioned results @xcite as well as our own pre - studies in @xcite",
    ", we are proposing that straightforward physical modeling can be used to show that the most basic electromagnetic heating mechanisms , such as standard joule heating and inductive heating , most likely can be disregarded for this medical application , whereas the potential application remains with the feasibility of achieving plasmonic ( electrophoretic ) resonances .",
    "recently , an optimal plasmonic resonance for the sphere has been defined as the optimal conjugate match with respect to the surrounding medium , _",
    "i.e. _ , the optimal permittivity of the spherical suspension that maximizes the absorption at any given frequency @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated in @xcite that for a surrounding medium consisting of a weak electrolyte solution ( relevant for human tissue in the ghz range ) , a significant radio or microwave heating can be achieved inside a small spherical gnp suspension , provided that an electrophoretic particle acceleration ( drude ) mechanism is valid and can be tuned into resonance at the desired frequency .    in this paper , we generalize the results in @xcite to include small structures of ellipsoidal shapes embedded in lossy media , and we provide explicit expressions for the corresponding absorption cross section and optimal conjugate match ( optimal plasmonic resonance ) .",
    "we investigate the necessary and sufficient condition regarding the feasibility of tuning a drude model to optimal conjugate match at a single frequency , and we discuss the relation between the optimal conjugate match and the classical frlich resonance condition .",
    "a relative absorption ratio is defined to facilitate a quantitative and unitless indicator for the achievable local heating , and some general expressions are finally given regarding the orientation of the ellipsoid in the polarizing field .",
    "numerical examples are included to illustrate the theory based on simple spheroidal geometries , and which at the same time are relevant for the potential medical application with electrophoretic heating of gnp suspensions in the microwave regime .",
    "the following notation and conventions will be used below .",
    "classical electromagnetic theory is considered based on si - units @xcite and with time convention @xmath0 for time harmonic fields .",
    "hence , a passive dielectric material with relative permittivity @xmath1 has positive imaginary part .",
    "let @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the permeability , the permittivity , the wave impedance and the speed of light in vacuum , respectively , and where @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",

    "in particular , from it can be shown that the optimal conjugate match @xmath31 is the maximizer of @xmath21 for @xmath32 , and which defines the optimal plasmonic resonance for the sphere in a lossy surrounding medium @xcite .",

    "it should be noted that the denominator @xmath39 in does not represent a pole of @xmath21 at @xmath40 , its significance is instead to cancel the corresponding zero that is present in the polarizability @xmath41 given by .      to derive the polarizability of a small homogeneous structure or a particle",
    ", it is assumed that the excitation is given by a constant static electric field @xmath42 , with the polarization defined by the direction of the @xmath43th cartesian axis .",
    "the fundamental equations to be solved are given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the electric field intensity and the electric flux density ( electric displacement ) , respectively , and where @xmath47 denotes the complex valued relative permittivity which is assigned the appropriate constant values inside and outside the structure .",
    "the equations in are solved by introducing the scalar potential @xmath48 where @xmath49 , and where @xmath48 satisfies the laplace equation @xmath50 , together with the continuity of @xmath48 as well as the continuity of the normal derivative @xmath51 at the boundary of the structure .",
    "finally , the scalar field must satisfy the asymptotic requirement @xmath52 .",
    "the resulting dipole moment relative the background is then given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes the electric field inside the structure and the letter @xmath55 is used to denote the domain of the structure as well as its volume .",
    "consider now a small ellipsoidal region consisting of a dielectric material with relative permittivity @xmath20 and volume @xmath55 , and which is suspended inside a lossy dielectric background medium having relative permittivity @xmath1 , see figure [ fig : rfsetup4pdf ] .",
    "both media are assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "let the largest spatial dimension of the ellipsoid be denoted @xmath56 and assume that @xmath57 .",
    "a solution to the electrostatic problem for the ellipsoid is provided by @xcite , and it is shown that when the applied field is aligned along one of the axes of the ellipsoid the resulting electric field @xmath58 is constant inside the particle and parallel to the applied field @xmath59 . from the analytical solution of this problem ,",
    "the polarizability @xmath60 of the ellipsoid is then finally obtained from the definition @xmath61 the resulting formula for the polarizability of the ellipsoid with semiaxes @xmath62 parallel to the cartesian axes @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and excitation @xmath42 is given by @xmath65 where @xmath66 for @xmath67 and where @xmath68 and @xmath69 , see @xcite . here ,",

    "this is obvious from the expression implying that @xmath79 when @xmath40 .",
    "note also that @xmath39 is the additional permittivity inside the particle with respect to the background .",
    "hence , the total polarization of the medium inside the particle can be written @xmath80 and the additional polarization @xmath81 yields the additional dipole moment relative the background @xmath82 where @xmath58 is a constant vector . by comparison of and , and exploiting that @xmath59 and @xmath58",
    "are parallel , it is found that the interior field of the particle is given by @xmath83 the poynting s theorem gives the total power loss inside the particle as @xmath84 where has been used .",
    "the power density of a plane wave in a lossy medium is given by @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "hence , the absorption cross section is finally obtained as @xmath88 which is identical to the formula given in .",
    "consider the real valued function @xmath89 where @xmath20 is a complex variable with @xmath90 and @xmath91 a constant with @xmath92 .",
    "take the complex derivative of @xmath93 with respect to @xmath94 to yield @xmath95 showing that @xmath96 is a stationary point .",
    "it has furthermore been shown in @xcite that @xmath93 is a strictly concave function with a local maximum at @xmath97 , and hence we refer to @xmath91 as the optimal conjugate match .",
    "the absorption cross section for the ellipsoid with polarizability , is given by @xmath98 by comparison of and , it is immediately seen that the optimal conjugate match for the ellipsoid is given by @xmath99 and which hence defines the optimal plasmonic resonance for the ellipsoid in a lossy surrounding medium .",
    "the sphere is a special case of the ellipsoid with @xmath100 yielding @xmath31 , and which reproduces the corresponding result given in @xcite .",
    "the notion of the optimal resonance defined in as being `` plasmonic '' is motivated by the fact that a `` normal '' lossy background medium would have @xmath101 and hence @xmath102 , which is a typical feature of plasmonic resonances and which can be achieved _",
    "e.g. _ , by tuning a drude model .",
    "if we consider the optimal conjugate match @xmath91 in as a function of frequency , then it represents a metamaterial in the sense that it has a negative real part ( a dielectric medium with inductive properties ) , and which can not in general be implemented as a passive material over a fixed bandwidth , see also @xcite .",
    "however , as will be shown below , in many cases a drude model can be tuned to optimal plasmonic resonance at any desired center frequency .      a generalized drude model for the permittivity of the ellipsoidal particle",
    "is given by @xmath103 where @xmath104 corresponds to the background material and where the static conductivity @xmath105 and the relaxation time @xmath106 are the parameters of the additional drude model .",
    "it is assumed that the background material is a `` normal '' material with @xmath107 and @xmath108 over the bandwidth of interest .",
    "the drude parameters may correspond to _",
    "e.g. _ , an electrophoretic mechanism where @xmath109 and @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the number of charged particles per unit volume , @xmath112 the particle charge , @xmath113 the friction constant of the host medium and @xmath114 the mass of the particle , see _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite .",
    "the drude parameters can be tuned to the optimal conjugate match by solving the equation @xmath115 where @xmath116 is given by and @xmath117 is the desired resonance frequency .",
    "this means that the following two equations corresponding to the real and imaginary parts of must be satisfied @xmath118 to find a solution to , it is necessary and sufficient that both equations have a right - hand side that is positive . for a `` normal '' surrounding material with @xmath101 , it is readily seen from that @xmath102 and hence that @xmath119 .",
    "for the imaginary part , the requirement that @xmath120 together with leads directly to the condition @xmath121 when the condition is fulfilled , the system can be solved to yield the following tuned drude parameters @xmath122 see also @xcite .",
    "consider the interpretation of the condition in the case with spheroidal shapes .",
    "choose for example the @xmath123 axis as the direction of the applied electric field @xmath124 , and let @xmath125 where @xmath126 . the ellipsoid is then a prolate spheroid when @xmath127 , a sphere when @xmath128 and an oblate spheroid when @xmath129 .",
    "the interpretation of is that the sphere and the prolate spheriod can always be tuned by a drude model to match the optimal value @xmath116 at any desired center frequency @xmath130 for which @xmath131 .",
    "an oblate spheroid , however , can only be tuned into optimal plasmonic resonance using the drude model , when the shape is not too flat and @xmath132 .",
    "this result agrees well with intuition , since polarizability ( and hence resonance ) is enhanced by prolongation of the particle shape in the direction of the polarizing field .",
    "the result generalizes the classical frhlich condition @xcite in the sense that gives the condition for an optimal plasmonic resonance of a small homogeneous ellipsoid , which is not an approximation and which is valid for a surrounding lossy medium .",
    "hence , the frhlich condition for the ellipsoid can be obtained from in a sequence of approximations as follows .",
    "first , the criterion is approximated as @xmath133 assuming that the imaginary parts of both @xmath1 and @xmath20 are small . using the following form of the drude model @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the plasma frequency given by @xmath136",
    ", the equation can be solved to yield the following frhlich resonance frequency @xmath137 where the last approximation is valid when @xmath138 . for a lossless surrounding medium with real valued @xmath1 , the frhlich resonance frequency for a sphere consisting of a drude metal",
    "is given by @xmath139 , see @xcite .",
    "the absorption cross section of a small volume with respect to the ambient material is given by @xmath140 , and which is valid for volumes of arbitrary shape , see also .",
    "a unitless relative absorption ratio for the ellipsoid can now be defined as @xmath141 where has been used , as well as the relationship @xmath142 . by inserting the optimal conjugate match into , the following optimal relative absorption ratio is obtained for excitation along the @xmath143 axis of the ellipsoid @xmath144    the relative absorption ratio given by and can be useful as a quantitative unitless measure showing how much more heating that potentially can be obtained in a small resonant region in comparison to the ambient local heating .",
    "it is important to note , however , that a complete system analysis would take into account not only the local heating capabilities , but also the significance of the frequency dependent penetration ( skin ) depth of the bulk material , see also @xcite .",
    "finally , a general expression is given for the absorption cross section of a small homogeneous ellipsoidal particle with arbitrary orientation with respect to the applied field .",
    "consider a small ellipsoidal region with its semiaxes @xmath62 aligned along the cartesian unit vectors @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and an applied electric field given by @xmath145 .",
    "due to the linearity of the fundamental equations , it is straightforward to generalize the expressions on absorption cross section given in sections [ sect : abshomellipsoids ] and [ sect : optplasmresellipsoid ] above .",
    "the polarizability can now be expressed in terms of the diagonal polarizability dyadic @xmath146 where @xmath147 , and the interior field @xmath58 is given by @xmath148 instead of .",
    "the total power loss inside the particle is now given by @xmath149 and the corresponding absorption cross section @xmath150 where @xmath151 . by using ,",
    "the absorption cross section and the relative absorption ratio finally becomes @xmath152 and @xmath153 it is immediately seen that the two expressions in and are strictly concave functions in terms of the complex variable @xmath20 for @xmath90 ( a positive combination of concave functions is a concave function , etc ) and the corresponding optimal plasmonic resonance is therefore well - defined and unique .",
    "however , it is no longer possible to obtain a simple closed form expression for the optimal conjugate match @xmath154 as in .",
    "to illustrate the theory , a numerical example is considered with parameter choices relevant for the application with microwave absorption in gold nanoparticle suspensions , see _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite .",
    "hence , the resonant frequency is chosen here as @xmath155 to mimic a typical system operating in the microwave regime , see _",

    "is taken the typical characteristics of human tissue .",
    "information about the dielectric properties of biological tissues can be found in _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite giving measurement results of most organs including brain ( grey matter ) , heart muscle , kidney , liver , inflated lung , spleen , muscle , etc . from these measurement results",
    "we conclude that human tissue can be realistically modelled by using a conductivity in the order of @xmath156@xmath157 and a permittivity similar to water at a frequency of @xmath156@xmath158 .",
    "hence , a simple conductivity - debye model for saline water is considered here where the surrounding medium is a weak electrolyte solution with relative permittivity @xmath159 where @xmath160 , @xmath161 and @xmath162 are the high frequency permittivity , the static permittivity and the dipole relaxation time in the corresponding debye model for water , respectively , and @xmath163 the conductivity of the saline solution . in the numerical examples below , these parameters are chosen as @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath166@xmath167 and @xmath168@xmath157 .    in figures [ fig : matfig503 ] through [ fig : matfig504b ] are shown the calculated relative absorption ratios for the ellipsoid with optimal , tuned drude and mismatched drude parameters , respectively .",

    "a spheroidal shape is considered with the geometrical factors @xmath125 and @xmath126 , and where the applied electric field @xmath124 is aligned along the @xmath123 axis of the spheroid and hence @xmath171 is given by .",
