    "the ions are trapped in a three - dimensional linear paul trap with an ion - electrode distance of @xmath59 .",
    "ions are loaded into the trap from an enriched source ( 12% @xmath60ca ) by isotope - selective photoionization  @xcite and may be held indefinitely under ultra - high vacuum conditions ( @xmath61 ) . for a single ion",
    "the axial and radial trap frequencies were @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively , the heating rate from the ground state of axial motion was measured to be @xmath64 , and the coherence time for the axial motional superposition state @xmath65 was found to be @xmath66 ( here and below @xmath67 stands for the relevant mode occupation number ) . due to the finite length of the trap , there is intrinsic axial micromotion ; for a two - ion crystal centred on the micromotion null the axial motion amplitude is @xmath68 , which reduces the raman carrier rabi frequency from @xmath69 to @xmath70 .",
    "there is a significant axial static magnetic field gradient of @xmath71 whose origin is not known , and which leads to a difference in the @xmath72 qubit frequencies of two ions in a crystal . the global single - qubit @xmath17 and @xmath73 rotations used in the two - qubit gate experiments",
    "are driven by microwave signals applied to one of the trap electrodes ; the rabi frequency for the @xmath72 qubit transition is @xmath74 .",
    "the slight difference in qubit frequencies results in imperfect microwave rotations , leading to the `` spin - echo error '' @xmath21 ( described further below ) .",
    "the ions radial and axial motion is first doppler cooled to @xmath75 ; then both the axial motional modes are cooled further by continuous raman sideband cooling to @xmath76 and finally by pulsed raman sideband cooling to @xmath12 .",

    "are initialised by optical pumping with 397  @xmath79-polarized and @xmath73-polarized light respectively ; @xmath79 beams for preparation and readout counter - propagate along the @xmath80-field direction in figure  [ f : gatebeams]b .",

    "we detect the total fluorescence using a photomultiplier ; for two ions , this does not allow us to distinguish the @xmath81 state from @xmath82 , but this is not a limitation in these experiments ( see below ) .    the sideband cooling , single - qubit gate and two - qubit gate operations are driven by three different pairs of raman laser beams , as illustrated in figure  [ f : gatebeams ] .",
    "the beams for the sideband cooling and the two - qubit gate propagate at @xmath10 and @xmath83 to the trap @xmath11-axis , such that their difference @xmath84-vector lies along @xmath11 , giving a lamb - dicke parameter for the two - ion centre - of - mass mode @xmath85 .",

    "the @xmath88 raman beams are derived from a pair of frequency - doubled diode lasers , the second ( slave ) of which is injection - locked at 794  from the first ( master ) via a double - pass @xmath89 acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) , allowing the 3.2  qubit splitting to be bridged for qubit carrier and sideband manipulations  @xcite .",
    "the output beam from the master is split , switched using two aoms , and brought close to the trap using @xmath90 long optical fibres ; these are the beams used to drive the two - qubit gate .",
    "a third raman beam is derived from the slave in a similar way , and is used in combination with a beam from the master laser to drive either single - qubit gates or sideband cooling ( the two alternative slave beam paths are both shown in figure  [ f : gatebeams]b ) .",
    "the raman beams are focused to waists of @xmath91 ( @xmath92 intensity radius ) at the ions .",

    "the gate beams are steered onto the ions using home - made piezo - actuated mirror mounts , by maximizing the qubit carrier rabi frequency @xmath69 for a single ion ; this aligns the beams on the trap centre with a precision of @xmath94 .",
    "we characterize long - term intensity and beam pointing noise by measuring the drift of @xmath69 , and find @xmath95 over periods of several hours ( figure  [ f : beamdrift ] ) ; this test was performed with non - copropagating beams , using the two - qubit gate beam paths .",
    "this drift would lead to systematic single- and two - qubit gate errors of @xmath96 .",
    "fast intensity noise was measured directly at the fibre outputs ( typically 0.2% r.m.s . ) , and relative phase noise was investigated by optical heterodyne measurements between both master / master and master / slave raman beam pairs  @xcite . amplitude and phase noise are estimated to contribute negligibly to the two - qubit gate error , but we believe the latter is the dominant source of error for the single - qubit gates  @xcite . the polarization of the @xmath97 raman beam is optimized with a @xmath98 waveplate to null any differential single - qubit light shift arising from this beam .     are synchronous with the ( @xmath998 minute ) laboratory air - conditioning cycle .",
    "a straight - line fit ( red line , slope @xmath100/hour ) is shown to give an indication of slow drift .",
    "a fractional change of @xmath101 would give a two - qubit gate error @xmath102 , hence these fluctuations are sufficiently small that they do not contribute significantly to the gate error ( table  [ t : errorbudget ] ) . ]",
    "the raman aoms are driven by direct digital synthesis ( dds ) radiofrequency sources , which allow dynamic control of the beam intensities and frequencies during the experimental sequence .",
    "the frequency control is used to switch the sideband cooling between the centre - of - mass and stretch mode frequencies .",
    "we use the amplitude control to shape the intensity turn - on and turn - off of one of the raman gate beams with a characteristic time of 1.5  ( and ensure the other beam is turned on before , and off after , the pulse - shaped beam ) .",
    "we estimate that without this pulse - shaping , there would be an additional average two - qubit gate error of up to @xmath103 at @xmath35 due to off - resonant carrier light shifts ( see below ) .",
    "the ion spacing is set by applying the raman gate beams to drive resonantly either the centre - of - mass mode ( @xmath104 ) or the stretch mode ( @xmath105 ) , for an initial state @xmath106 with both motional modes cooled to the ground state . when the ion spacing is a half - integer number of standing wave periods , there is maximal excitation of the stretch mode and minimal excitation of the centre - of - mass mode , because the force on the two ions is in opposing senses .",
    "the motional excitation is probed using a raman red - sideband @xmath73 pulse .",
    "we optimize the gate duration @xmath6 by scanning the length of the raman gate pulses , as shown in figure  [ f : parity]b , and minimizing the ` single spin - flip ' signal @xmath107 , as measured at the end of the spin - echo sequence .",
    "setting @xmath6 to a precision of 0.1% should lead to a systematic gate error of @xmath108 .",
    "once the gate duration has been set , we optimize the accumulated geometric phase ( i.e.  the total area swept out in the motional phase space ) by adjusting the power in one of the raman beams to equalize the populations @xmath109 and @xmath110 , again measured at the end of the spin - echo sequence .",
    "we aim to balance the populations to a precision of 1% , which gives a systematic gate error of @xmath108 .",
    "we measure the two - qubit gate error by using the two - qubit gate , along with single - qubit rotations , to generate the bell state @xmath111 , whose fidelity we measure with a partial tomography procedure  @xcite .",
    "the bell state error includes errors from the qubit state - preparation and measurement ( spam ) , the single - qubit rotations , and the two - qubit gate itself . in our reported gate errors",
    "we have corrected for the spam error @xmath22 and the dominant single - qubit error @xmath21 , neither of which is intrinsic to the gate operation , in order to obtain the best estimate of the error in the two - qubit gate itself .",
    "this allows quantitative comparison both with our own error model and with experimental gate errors measured by other techniques which naturally exclude spam and single - qubit errors , such as randomized benchmarking  @xcite .",
    "we describe in this section our methods to determine @xmath22 and @xmath21 , as well as our data fitting procedure .    for a single ion",
    ", we measure a combined state preparation and single - shot readout error of 0.90(5)@xmath45 using state - selective shelving and thresholded fluorescence detection  @xcite . for two ions , the spam error per qubit",
    "@xmath22 is greater as we use a longer detection period ( 1.9 ) , to improve discrimination between 0 , 1 and 2 ions fluorescing , which increases the error due to spontaneous decay from the shelf ( lifetime 1168(7 )  @xcite ) .",
    "the two photon - count thresholds were set before the gate runs using independent control data , and were not adjusted in data analysis .",
    "we measure @xmath22 with a two - ion crystal by preparing and reading out the @xmath106 and @xmath112 states typically @xmath113 times each , allowing us to extract the readout errors for the @xmath114 , @xmath115 qubit states and hence the average per - qubit error @xmath116 .",
    "we then construct a linear map for two qubits to infer the populations of the states @xmath117 or @xmath118 from the experimental signals ( 0 , 1 or 2 ions fluorescing )  @xcite . on the day when the @xmath35 two - qubit gate data were taken , we measured @xmath119 using two ions . to investigate the stability of the spam error ,",
    "we made two - ion spam measurements on six separate days with similar precision ; these measurements have a standard deviation of 0.11@xmath45 , somewhat in excess of the statistical precision , but small compared with the uncertainty in @xmath20 .",
    "if we did not correct for spam errors , the apparent infidelity in the bell state would increase by @xmath120 ( see  @xcite ) .    in calculating the spam error for the states @xmath81 and @xmath82 we make the assumption that it is identical for both ions .",
    "we confirm that the state - preparation and state - selective shelving error is identical for both ions , by measuring the spam error for a single ion placed at each ion location of the two - ion crystal .",
    "however , for two - ion experiments we expect there to be a small difference in the fluorescence detection error between the states @xmath121 and the states @xmath122 due to spontaneous decay from during the fluorescence detection period . a numerical model of the readout process including shelf decay shows that , for our typical bright and dark count rates , our method of estimating the spam error gives a systematic overestimate of gate errors of @xmath57 ; this is substantially smaller than the statistical uncertainty in the gate error and we do not attempt to correct for it .    as a result of the axial magnetic field gradient , for two ions the @xmath72 qubit frequencies differ by @xmath123 .",
    "although this does not affect the gate operation itself , it does introduce errors in the global single - qubit @xmath17 and @xmath73 rotations in the spin - echo sequence . the rabi frequency for the single - qubit operations",
    "is @xmath74 , thus the errors due to the @xmath124 detuning errors for single @xmath73 pulses and @xmath17 pulses are @xmath125 and @xmath57 respectively . in the spin - echo sequence",
    "these errors coherently add or subtract , depending on the phase of the pulses relative to the precessing qubit phases ; as we increase the length of the spin - echo sequence to accommodate slower gates the relative phases of the pulses change due to the different qubit detunings . to quantify the effect of this error",
    ", we perform numerical simulations to determine the error in producing a bell state from @xmath106 assuming a perfect two - qubit phase gate  @xcite .",
    "we find the error @xmath21 varies sinusoidally as a function of the duration of the spin - echo sequence , with a first maximum of @xmath126 when @xmath127 . as this error depends only on the qubit frequency difference @xmath128 and the rabi frequency @xmath129 , both of which we can determine accurately , negligible uncertainty in @xmath20",
    "is introduced by subtracting @xmath21 from the bell state error .",
    "there are several other sources of error from the single - qubit operations , such as detuning error of the @xmath26 $ ] tomography pulses , imperfectly set pulse areas and off - resonant excitation ; these are estimated to be @xmath130 , well below the statistical error in @xmath20 , and we do not attempt to correct for them .",
    "we use maximum - likelihood fitting to fit the parity fringes ( figure  [ f : parity]a ) with the function @xmath131}$ ] where the phase offset @xmath132 allows for an undetermined phase shift due to drift in the applied magnetic field @xmath80 .",
    "we find that @xmath132 differs by 0.8(2 )  for the two @xmath35 data sets shown in figure  [ f : parity]a , which may be accounted for by a drift @xmath133 during the period between the two runs , consistent with the level we typically observe .",
    "such drift could be straightforwardly eliminated by feedback to the magnetic field , for example using a field sensor or co - trapped sympathetic cooling ions of a second species .",
    "the fitted amplitude offset @xmath134 is consistent with zero .",
    "a joint fit to both data sets gives a fitted amplitude @xmath135 ; together with the population measurement without tomography pulses , @xmath136 , we obtain the bell state fidelity @xmath137 , before correction for @xmath21 .",
    "the statistical errors on the parity signal are distributed according to a binomial distribution , as the parity is either even or odd .",
    "hence it is appropriate to fit the data using a maximum - likelihood method assuming binomially - distributed measurements ( as opposed to , for example , least - squares fitting , which assumes normally - distributed data  @xcite ) . to verify our fitting procedure",
    "we generate many synthetic sets of parity fringes , using binomially - distributed random numbers and the same number of trials as in the experiments , for a range of contrasts @xmath138 .",
    "we find that the maximum - likelihood fit gives an unbiased estimate of the contrast used to generate the synthetic data sets .",
    "we also find that using a least - squares fit would lead to a systematic under - estimate of the bell state error ( by @xmath125 for our typical experimental parameters ) .",
    "further details of these tests are given in  @xcite .",
    "we consider the dominant sources of error in the two - qubit gate , as listed in table  [ t : errorbudget ] and plotted in figure  [ f : allgates]a .",
    "a more detailed discussion may be found in  @xcite , where the following sources of error are also considered : unequal illumination of the two ions by the gate beams , incorrect spacing of the ions , amplitude and phase noise in the raman beams , drifts in the axial mode frequency , and the effect of coupling between radial and axial motional modes . for our conditions ,",
    "these errors are estimated to be negligible compared with those discussed here .",
    "as shown in figure  [ f : allgates]a , the dominant contribution to the error for gate times @xmath139 is due to photon scattering .",
    "this comprises both raman and rayleigh contributions ; the latter also contributes to decoherence because of the differential scattering rates from the two qubit states  @xcite .",
    "we adapted the scattering theory of previous authors  @xcite for our situation and checked the predictions by : ( i ) measuring the coherence decay of a single - qubit @xmath140 superposition state while a single raman beam is applied for a variable duration ( figure  [ f : scattering]a ) ; ( ii ) applying the two - qubit gate and measuring the bell state error as a function of @xmath4 , while adjusting the raman beam powers so as to keep the rabi frequency constant ( figure  [ f : scattering]b ) .",

    "<S> we demonstrate laser - driven two - qubit and single - qubit logic gates with fidelities 99.9(1)% and 99.9934(3)% respectively , significantly above the @xmath0 minimum threshold level required for fault - tolerant quantum computation , using qubits stored in hyperfine ground states of calcium-43 ions held in a room - temperature trap . </S>",
    "<S> we study the speed / fidelity trade - off for the two - qubit gate , for gate times between 3.8  and 520 , and develop a theoretical error model which is consistent with the data and which allows us to identify the principal technical sources of infidelity .    </S>",
    "<S> a powerful quantum computer need not require more than a few thousand logical qubits , but the number of physical qubits required depends strongly on the precision with which they can be manipulated  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fault - tolerant quantum error correction typically requires that the errors associated with all operations ( qubit initialization , single- and two - qubit logic gates , and readout ) must each be below a threshold level of @xmath1 in order for a quantum computer to function at all  @xcite . the ability to entangle qubits `` on demand '' has been demonstrated in several physical systems  @xcite and error rates slightly below threshold have been achieved using trapped ions  @xcite and superconducting circuits  @xcite . however , the precision has so far fallen short of that needed for the construction of a practical quantum computer , because error rates at least an order of magnitude below threshold are required for the number of physical qubits per logical qubit to remain reasonable  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the speed of the operations is also an important parameter : gate speed does not need to be fast in absolute terms ( a quantum computer derives its power from the exponential scaling of its workspace with the number of qubits , not from its clock speed ) , but should be sufficiently fast relative to the qubit coherence time that the memory error is also well below the threshold . in general , there is a trade - off between speed and fidelity , both for specific systems ( as studied here ) and between different platforms . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the strong interactions in the solid state permit sub - microsecond two - qubit gates for superconducting qubits , much faster than is typical for trapped ions , but at present also limit qubit coherence times to 100 . in both these physical systems , </S>",
    "<S> the present limitations to gate speed and fidelity are technical rather than fundamental .    </S>",
    "<S> the first detailed proposals for implementing the theoretical ideas of quantum information processing appeared in the 1990s , and were based on laser - cooled trapped ions  @xcite , and on single - electron quantum dots  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> individual trapped ions possess extremely stable internal states for the storage of quantum information ( such states form the basis of some of the most accurate atomic clocks  @xcite ) and the ion - ion coupling arising from the mutual coulomb repulsion provides a natural mechanism for implementing multi - qubit quantum logic . as in other physical systems , </S>",
    "<S> the quantum logic operations which entangle distinct qubits are the most technically challenging to implement , because  however stable the internal qubit states  the quantum information needs to be transmitted between qubits via an external channel which is generally more susceptible to environmental noise . in the case of trapped ions , this channel is the quantized motion of the ions in the harmonic oscillator potential of the trap and is thus sensitive to the effective motional temperature of the ions and to noise in the electric fields used to confine them . </S>",
    "<S> the highest fidelity previously reported  @xcite for a two - qubit gate in trapped ions was 99.3(1)% ( a level which has recently been equalled using superconducting qubits  @xcite ) ; this used an optical qubit transition and hence required good frequency stability in the optical domain . </S>",
    "<S> qubits based on hyperfine ground states , in common with superconducting qubits , operate in the more convenient microwave domain ; in contrast to manufactured solid state qubits , however , the qubit frequency is defined by universal atomic properties and this may simplify large - scale architectures .        </S>",
    "<S> we report in this letter an experimental and theoretical study of a two - qubit gate operation  @xcite for hyperfine trapped - ion qubits driven by raman laser beams which , together with microwave - driven single - qubit operations , produces a bell state ( a maximally - entangled state ) whose fidelity we measure by quantum state tomography . by independent characterization of the single - qubit errors , </S>",
    "<S> we infer the error in the gate operation itself . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a theoretical error model for the gate , verify the dominant error contributions in auxiliary experiments , and find good agreement with the experimental results . </S>",
    "<S> this both confirms the accuracy of our fidelity result , and shows where future work should be focussed . </S>",
    "<S> we also measure the average error in laser - driven single - qubit rotations , using randomized benchmarking . </S>",
    "<S> for both the single- and two - qubit gates we systematically explore the trade - off between gate speed and error .    </S>",
    "<S> the particular two - qubit gate we apply is a @xmath2 phase gate  @xcite ( @xmath3 being the pauli operator ) , driven by a pair of raman laser beams at a mean detuning @xmath4 from an optical atomic resonance , where the qubits are stored in the = and = states of the ground hyperfine manifold of ( where the superscripts denote the quantum numbers @xmath5 ; see figure  [ f : gatebeams]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the raman beams exert a state - dependent force on the ions , which transiently excites their centre - of - mass axial motion when they are in the or states , in turn giving an overall phase on the two - qubit wavefunction for these two states . to vary the gate time </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 we adjust @xmath4 while holding the raman beam intensity constant ; smaller @xmath4 enables a faster gate , at the cost of increased error due to photon scattering  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the raman difference frequency is @xmath7 where @xmath8 and the axial trap frequency is @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the raman beams propagate at @xmath10 to the trap @xmath11-axis , such that their wave - vector difference lies along @xmath11 ( figure  [ f : gatebeams]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> we cool both of the ions axial modes close to the ground state of motion ( mean vibrational quantum number @xmath12 ) by raman sideband cooling ; the centre - of - mass mode ( with effective temperature @xmath13 ) , rather than the stretch mode , is used to implement the gate to avoid coupling to the hotter ( @xmath14 ) radial modes of motion  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the raman pulses used to implement the gate are shaped in time , to reduce errors due to off - resonant excitation ( see supplemental material ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we divide the gate operation into two pulses , each of duration @xmath15 , embedded within a global spin - echo sequence  @xcite , which ideally produces the bell state @xmath16 , and use further single - qubit @xmath17 rotations to measure the fidelity @xmath18 of the state @xmath19 obtained  @xcite , see figure  [ f : parity]a . thus the measured bell state infidelity includes both the error @xmath20 due to the gate operation itself and errors in the single - qubit operations ( principally spin - echo @xmath21 , state preparation and measurement @xmath22 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we characterize the single - qubit errors by independent experiments in order to extract the two - qubit gate error ; the errors in the single - qubit operations are comparable to or smaller than the gate error over the parameter regime studied ( see supplemental material ) . </S>",

    "<S> the data are compared with a theoretical model comprising the four leading sources of gate error ( see supplemental material ) . </S>",
    "<S> the model gives a minimum error estimate since it assumes all control parameters ( for example , laser beam intensities ) are set to their optimum values ; in reality fluctuations in these parameters , and the finite precision with which each can be set , lead to higher errors . despite this , the data exceed the model prediction by , on average , less than a factor of two over the full range of gate speeds studied . </S>",

    "<S> the gate duration was changed by adjusting the raman beam intensity ; two fixed detunings were used , @xmath47 ( circles ) and @xmath48 ( crosses ) . </S>",
    "<S> statistical error is smaller than the symbol size . </S>",
    "<S> the curve is an empirical model fitted to the data , which allows for differential phase noise between the two raman beams ( see supplemental material ) . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we also performed multiple @xmath42 gates within a single , fixed - length , spin - echo sequence ( figure  [ f : allgates]a , inset ) ; as @xmath21 and @xmath22 do not vary with the number of gates , this allows an independent estimate of the two - qubit gate error . making the conservative assumption of an error linear in the number of gates , we obtain an error - per - gate of @xmath49 , independent of all single - qubit and spam errors ; this value of @xmath20 is dominated by the calculated increase in photon scattering error compared with the 100  gate . </S>",
    "<S> it would be desirable to perform longer sequences of gates , for example for the purpose of randomized benchmarking  @xcite ; however , in our system this would not yield useful information on the two - qubit gate error , as the measured error would be dominated by single - qubit errors , due to the effects of 50  magnetic field noise and the magnetic field offset between the two ions ( see supplemental material ) .    </S>",

    "<S> these states are nearly independent of magnetic field to first order , allowing randomized benchmarking  @xcite to be used ( which is necessary to render the gate error observable above the state preparation and measurement errors ) . </S>",
    "<S> the two - qubit gate can not be directly applied to these `` memory qubit '' states  @xcite , but mapping between similar memory and gate qubits in has been demonstrated with error 0.2@xmath45 using microwave techniques  @xcite ; mapping both ways for two qubits would thus increase the net two - qubit gate error , but this additional mapping cost should be straightforward to reduce by improved magnetic field control . </S>",
    "<S> we employed the same randomized benchmarking protocol as in previous work on microwave - driven single - qubit gates  @xcite , here using typically 160 distinct random sequences each consisting of up to 1000 computational gates . </S>",
    "<S> results are shown in figure  [ f : allgates]b ; the average gate error is below 1@xmath45 over the entire range of gate speeds studied ( @xmath53 ) , with a minimum of 0.066(3)@xmath45 at a gate duration of @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> this represents a five - fold reduction in error compared with previous laser - driven single - qubit gates , without incurring the overhead of composite pulse techniques  @xcite . for a pair of ions </S>",
    "<S> , we also demonstrated individual qubit addressing using the trap s axial micromotion  @xcite with an estimated cross - talk error of 0.1(1)@xmath45 ( see supplemental material ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we now discuss the prospects for implementing the single- and two - qubit laser gates described in the present work in ion trap systems suitable for scalable quantum information processing , without sacrificing gate fidelity . </S>",
    "<S> two complementary schemes are currently being pursued , the `` quantum ccd '' approach in which ions are shuttled around a large microfabricated array of interconnected traps  @xcite and a `` network '' model where multiple small traps are connected by photonic links which enable heralded entanglement  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> both schemes require local deterministic gates with errors @xmath54  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> sympathetic cooling using a different ion species will also be necessary  @xcite ; we have previously used for this purpose  @xcite , and have recently demonstrated that the two - qubit gate used here is also capable of mapping quantum information coherently between these two isotopes  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . for improved protection of logic qubits different elements can be used  @xcite . in the network model , a macroscopic ion trap such as that used in this work could be used at each node of the network , although it would be advantageous to have several interconnected trapping zones at each node  @xcite . in the quantum ccd model , microfabricated surface - electrode traps are likely to be necessary because of the large number of zones required  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the first difficulty in using surface traps is that the ions are typically trapped much closer to the electrodes , where the electric field noise is greater , disrupting the coherent motional dynamics of the gate . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in the room - temperature surface trap used for the high - fidelity single - qubit work reported in  @xcite , we have measured motional heating and decoherence rates one to two orders of magnitude higher than in the macroscopic trap used here . according to our error model , this will limit the two - qubit gate error to a minimum of @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> however , significant reductions in electric field noise have been obtained in surface traps , either by cooling the electrodes to cryogenic temperatures  @xcite or by _ in situ _ cleaning of the electrode surfaces  @xcite ; this should allow significantly lower @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> a second technical issue for surface traps is the proximity of the relatively powerful raman beams to the surface : stray laser light can cause charging of the trap  @xcite , which also leads to uncontrolled electric fields . </S>",
    "<S> we have investigated this by aligning a beam of similar power to our raman beams on an ion trapped 75  above the surface trap used in  @xcite ; we find no detectable change in the required compensation field , at a level @xmath56 , indicating that for light of the wavelength ( 397 ) required for , and these trap materials ( gold electrodes on a sapphire substrate ) , charging is not a significant problem and there would be negligible effect on the gate error .    </S>",
    "<S> all the contributions to the two - qubit gate error budget ( table  [ t : errorbudget ] ) can be reduced by technical improvements ; for example , improved magnetic field stabilization would reduce the spin dephasing error . </S>",
    "<S> the only error which is fundamentally limited is that due to photon scattering ; this can be reduced to the @xmath57 level ( in ) by a factor @xmath58 increase in the raman beam intensity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the laser power used in these experiments is modest ( 5  in each gate beam , with waist 27 ) , and could be further reduced by integrating optical elements with the trap structure , allowing more tightly focussed beams while retaining beam - pointing stability  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> solid state diode lasers are a more readily scalable technology than the frequency - doubled lasers used in this work , and it has been shown that similar power and spectral purity can be obtained from the latest generation of violet laser diodes , using optical injection locking  @xcite ; an array of such injected diodes could be used to implement thousands of gate operations in parallel . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that , with existing technology , the 99.9%  two - qubit gate fidelity demonstrated here can be maintained and improved in the ion trap systems currently envisaged for the implementation of large - scale quantum computation . </S>",
    "<S> the task of scaling up quantum information processors beyond the present generation of few - qubit demonstrators remains a formidable one , but we hope that this work will both enable and stimulate efforts to address this technical challenge .    we note that laser - driven quantum logic gates with comparable fidelity have recently been reported by the nist ion storage group , using hyperfine qubits  @xcite .    </S>",
