    "due to their interesting mathematical structure and possible physical applications deformed algebras have attracted much attention in the last twenty years . in 1982",
    "kulish @xcite showed that the underlying algebra of the @xmath2-heisenberg spin model was a deformation of the @xmath3 algebra , called nowadays @xmath4 .    following the technique developed by schwinger to compose two heisenberg oscillators to obtain @xmath3 algebra , in 1989",
    "macfarlane and biedenharn @xcite constructed the @xmath4 algebra using two @xmath5-oscillators .",
    "@xmath5-oscillator algebra is a deformation of the heisenberg algebra through a parameter @xmath5 , which reproduces heisenberg algebra when the parameter @xmath6 .    since heisenberg algebra has an important role in several areas of physics it was tempting to search for applications of this new structure .",
    "thus , there was an intense study of possible physical applications of @xmath5-oscillators and since then some succesfull ones have been described in the literature @xcite .",
    "they have also been used as a phenomenological approach to study composite particles @xcite , spectra of atoms and molecules @xcite , generalized field theory @xcite and coherent states @xcite .",
    "recently , a new algebraic structure was proposed @xcite that generalizes the heisenberg algebra .",
    "this structure contains also @xmath5-oscillators as a particular case and has been successfully used in some different physical problems @xcite . in this new algebra ,",
    "called generalized heisenberg algebra ( gha ) , the commutation relations among the operators @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 depend on a general analytic functional @xmath0 and are given by : @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12=f(j_0)-j_0,\\ ] ] with @xmath13 and @xmath14 . identifying the operator @xmath9 with the hamiltonian of a physical system , this algebra tell us that the @xmath9 eigenvalues ( @xmath15 in fock space ) , which are the energy spectrum of the physical system , are obtained by an one - step recurrence ( @xmath16 ) , _ i.e _ , each eigenvalue depends on the previous one .",
    "thus , the eigenvalue behavior can be studied by dynamical system techniques , enormously simplifying the task of finding possible representations of the algebra @xcite .    when the functional @xmath0 is linear we re - obtain the @xmath5-oscillator algebra @xcite ; other kinds of functionals give more general algebraic structures than @xmath5-oscillators @xcite .",
    "the functional @xmath0 can be , for example , a polynomial and therefore it depends on some parameters ( the polynomial coefficients ) .",
    "depending on the kind of functional and their parameters , finite or infinite representations are allowed @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9 operator eigenvalues depend on the characteristic function @xmath0 and it can present a variety of different behaviors ( monotonously increasing or decreasing , etc , upper limited or not , etc ) @xcite . for instance , for the functional @xmath17 , where @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 being the mass and the length of the well , one obtains the square - well potential algebra @xcite .",
    "however , there are several systems which can not be described by such a class of algebras .",
    "quasi - periodic structures have attracted much interest lately @xcite .",
    "in particular , fibonacci sequences were considered in several areas of mathematics and physics @xcite .",
    "moreover , it was shown that an electron gas under sudden heating has a quasiequilibrium regime with a quasiperiodic energy distribution @xcite . since most systems having a quasiperiodic energy spectrum can not be described by the gha , in this paper we are going to present a first step in this direction .",
    "we construct here a heisenberg - type algebra for a system having the energy spectrum described by a generalized fibonacci sequence . in order to realize this",
    ", we propose a simple algebraic structure depending on two functionals , @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we introduce an operator @xmath21 , being the hamiltonian of a system , as it was done in eqs .",

    "having eigenvalues obeying the equation @xmath22 , i.e. , the eigenvalue of the @xmath23-th state depends on the two previous eigenvalues .",
    "we call this structure a _ two - step algebra_. in order to extend the `` one - step algebra '' described by the gha , we introduce also an additional operator @xmath24 .    when both functionals @xmath0 and @xmath1 appearing in the two - step algebra are linear functions , we show that we can re - write both the @xmath21 and @xmath24 operators in fock space as functions of a single number operator , @xmath25 . the algebraic structure generated by these functionals",
    "contains the gha , @xmath5-oscillator algebra and is related to other interesting algebras as special cases .    in section",
    "ii we introduce the two - step generalized heisenberg algebra .",
    "in section iii we study the linear case for the algebra , that contains a fibonacci - like spectra and many other interesting quasi - periodic sequences and we also discuss the types of representations we could find . in section iv we present our conclusions and in the appendix we classify possible representations for the algebra when @xmath0 and @xmath1 , appearing in the algebra , are linear functions .",
    "we propose an structure generated by the operators @xmath21 , @xmath24 , @xmath26 and @xmath7 , with @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath27 , being the step operators , @xmath28 the hamiltonian and @xmath29 , obeying the following relations :     + where we have assumed that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are analytical functions . in the fock space representation of this structure , one has the normalized vacuum state @xmath30 defined by the relations : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are real numbers .    a casimir operator associated with this algebraic relations",
