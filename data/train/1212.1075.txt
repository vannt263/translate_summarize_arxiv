    "thus , measurements of both the sz effect and of the x - ray emission of hundreds of clusters will soon be available up to a redshift of @xmath8 @xcite .    the sz effect is often expressed in terms of the integrated compton parameter @xmath1 ( see sect .",

    "are approximations of the thermal energy contained in the clusters , and are thus expected to strongly correlate with total mass , weakly depending on its dynamical state @xcite . in the limit where gravity completely dominates cluster formation , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are expected to scale in the same way with mass and redshift as power - laws .",
    "indeed , numerical simulations suggest they both have equivalent scaling relations that are close to be self - similar .",
    "thus , the @xmath11 relation is expected to be , on average , constant at all @xmath7 @xcite .",

    "in fact , the @xmath16 and the @xmath2 parameters have different dependencies on the fine structure constant , so that their ratio strongly depends on @xmath0 .",
    "the fact that no deviation from a constant have yet been observed in the @xmath13 relation can be used to constrain variations in @xmath0 .    currently , the most powerful probe of @xmath0 in the redshift range @xmath17 are atomic absorption lines in quasar spectra .",

    "a first analysis of 143 absorption systems over redshift range @xmath18 observed by the keck telescope suggested a time variation of the fine structure constant at the 5-sigma level @xcite , a result that was however questioned by an independent analysis ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a more recent result @xcite , that combines the keck data with a new sample of 154 measurements from the vlt suggests on the other hand a spatial variation in @xmath0 .",

    "the significance of this claim is @xmath21 , and no systematics that could justify such a variation have yet been found .",
    "this clearly stimulates the attempts to find additional hints of variation of @xmath0 , preferably with probes alternative to quasars .",
    "clusters can explore redshifts lower than quasars , ( @xmath22 versus @xmath23 ) , but these still correspond to a large range of look - back time ( @xmath24 versus ( @xmath25 ) ) .",
    "furthermore , current quasar data provide tight contraints on the variation of the fine structure constant at redshifts higher than @xmath26 @xcite , while clusters can already provide constraints at lower redshifts .",
    "potentially , clusters could be a better probe at low @xmath7 , as there are many thousands of clusters at these redshifts , where it is harder to find quasar absorption systems .",

    "over 80% of the baryonic content of clusters of galaxies is expected to be under the form of intergalactic hot gas at temperatures of order @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the ionized gas can inverse compton scatter cmb photons , leaving a signature , the sunyaev - zeldovich effect , in the cmb spectrum @xcite .",

    "the cylindrical parameter can then be linked ( see e.g. @xcite ) to the commonly used spherical integrated compton parameter , defined as : @xmath47 we will use the spherical integrated compton parameter in the following , calling it simply @xmath16 .    thus the @xmath16 parameter depends on the fine structure constant via the thompson cross section in eq .",
    "[ sigmat ] as @xmath48      at the high temperatures of galaxy clusters , the intergalactic gas emits mainly through thermal bremsstrahlung , whose emissivity , i.e. the emitted power per unit volume at frequency @xmath49 , is ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the ion density , @xmath52 the bolzmann constant , @xmath53 the planck constant , @xmath54 is the atomic number .",
    "@xmath55 is the gaunt factor which corrects for quantum mechanical effects and varies slowly with frequency and temperature .",
    "we do not observe the emissivity directly , but the surface brightness , i.e. its integral along the line of sight at different angular distances from the center of the cluster @xmath41 : @xmath56    thus , deprojecting the surface brightness allows measuring the emissivity , which depends on the estimate of the angular diameter distance as @xmath57 .",
    "the magnitude of the x - ray emission is often quantified through the @xmath2 parameter @xcite , which is analogous to the sz parameter @xmath16 .",
    "it is defined as @xmath58    here , @xmath59 is the x - ray determined gas mass within a certain cluster radius @xmath60 , and @xmath61 is the spectroscopically determined x - ray temperature of the cluster , determined within a cylindrical annulus . the gas mass is defined as @xmath62    with @xmath63 is the mean molecular weight of eletrons . the gas mass can be determined from x - ray data as the density profile of the cluster can be inferred from the emissivity in eq .",

    "we can not logically exclude the possibility that intrisic changes of the ratio @xmath86 or uncorrected systematics might provoke a variation in the @xmath87 relation that conspires to precisely cancel a true variation in @xmath0 resulting in no apparent variation.this case would lead to a false rejection of the variation hypothesis .",
    "we present in this section constraints on @xmath0 from current data . for the analysis",

    "we thus use 61 clusters , in the redshift range @xmath89 .",
    "the @xmath16 and @xmath2 parameters we use here are measured within a radius @xmath90 , i.e. the radius at which the mean matter density of the cluster is @xmath91 times larger than the critical density at the redshift of the cluster .",

    "however , we use this dataset to provide a first estimate of the constraints on @xmath0 that one can derive from this dataset .",
    "we first analyze the data in order to find constraints on @xmath0 under the simple assumption that no evolution in time or space is present , i.e. that the @xmath93 ratio is a constant .",
    "any deviation exceeding statistical error is attributed to intrinsic scatter .",
    "we calculate the mean of @xmath93 through a modified weighted least square method ( mwls ) .",
    "this method differs from a simple weighted least square because it takes into account the fact that statistical uncertainties on @xmath94 , calculated by propagating the statistical errors on @xmath1 and @xmath2 , can be underestimated or can neglect intrinsic scatter .",
    "a weighted least square method provides in fact a simple weighted mean of @xmath95 , with a @xmath96 per degrees of freedom of @xmath97 .",
    "clearly , such a high reduced @xmath96 might indicate either that a constant is a poor description of the @xmath93 data , or the presence of e.g. additional intrinsic scatter . under this second assumption ,",
    "we can account for a possible wider dispersion of the data by quadratically adding to the statistical error of each data point a constant term @xmath98(see e.g. @xcite ) for the unknown intrinsic scatter .",
    "the weighted mean and the intrinsic scatter are then jointly determined so that the reduced @xmath96 equals @xmath99 . following this method , we obtain @xmath100 , i.e.,@xmath101 .",
    "this result is in perfect agreement with the results found by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we find that the intrinsic scatter term for each data point is equal to @xmath102 .",
    "we note here that we do not correct the data for malmquist bias , which for this set of data is not expected to modify the best fit @xcite , but might provide a slightly higher estimate of the intrinsic scatter compared to corrected data .    in order to check the results from the mwls method",
    ", we also calculate the mean as a simple arithmetic average and estimate its uncertainty by bootstrap resampling . in this case",
    "we obtain @xmath103 , in agreement with what previously found .",
    "the scatter in this case is calculated following @xcite : we calculate the scattering term @xmath104 as the quadratic difference between the raw scatter @xmath105 and the statistical uncertainty @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the reduced @xmath96 , @xmath108 is the number of degrees of freedom , in this case equal to @xmath109 , and @xmath110 is the number of clusters , in this case equal to @xmath111 .",
