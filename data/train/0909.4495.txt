    "charged - particle emissions are among the most important decay modes of atomic nuclei . almost all observed proton - rich exotic nuclei starting from @xmath7 are @xmath3 radioactive  @xcite .",

    "a number of theoretical models were proposed to describe the charged - particle decay process  @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite for very recent calculations ) .",
    "in general the decay process , ranging from proton to heavier cluster radioactive decays , can be described by a two - step mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the first step refers to the formation of the particle and its motion on the daughter nuclear surface . in the second step the cluster , with the formation amplitude and corresponding wave function thus determined ,",
    "is assumed to penetrate through the centrifugal and coulomb barriers  @xcite .",
    "this second step is well understood since the pioneering work of gamow  @xcite . in macroscopic models ,",
    "cluster decay is treated as the quantum tunneling process of an already preformed particle  @xcite , where features like the probability that the cluster is formed on the nuclear surface are ignored . in these models",
    "the clusterization process is included in an effective fashion by introducing quantities adjusted to reproduce as many measured half - lives as possible .",
    "such semiclassical models are being successfully applied even at present , although in some cases microscopical ingredients are also included  @xcite . in microscopic theories",
    "the formation amplitude is evaluated starting from the single - particle degrees of freedom of the neutrons and protons that eventually become the cluster .",
    "this is generally a formidable task which requires advanced computing facilities as well as suitable theoretical schemes to describe the clusterization process  @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "this variety of theoretical models may serve as a guide to our searching of semiclassical relations in the radioactive decay .",
    "the first striking correlation in @xmath3 decay systematics was noted by geiger and nuttall  @xcite .",
    "this relates the decay half - lives @xmath10 and decay energies @xmath11 as , @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are constants .",
    "nowadays it is understood that the @xmath2-value dependence in eq .",
    "( [ gn - o ] ) is a manifestation of the quantum penetration of the @xmath3-cluster through the coulomb barrier ( see , for example , ref .",
    "but this equation ignores the probability that the @xmath3-particle is formed on the nuclear surface starting from its four constituent nucleons moving inside the mother nucleus .",
    "the linear relation  ( [ gn - o ] ) has been found to hold well for the ground - state to ground - state decays of even - even nuclei in the same major shell with fixed proton number . however , the geiger - nuttall law in the form of eq .",
    "( [ gn - o ] ) has limited prediction power since the coefficients @xmath13 and @xmath14 change for the decays of different isotopic series  @xcite .",
    "intensive works have been done trying to generalize the geiger - nuttall law for a universal description of all observed @xmath3 decay events  @xcite .",

    "but the physical origin of this dependence is not clear .",
    "empirical linear relations were also found in the cases of proton decays  @xcite , heavier cluster decays  @xcite and both @xmath3 and heavier cluster decays  @xcite .",
    "reviews on existing empirical relations can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite and thus will not be detailed here .",
    "in particular , some recent searches of correlations in radioactive decays start from the macroscopic description of the decay process with a concentration on the coulomb barrier penetrability  @xcite , which are physically more sound than mere empirical relations .",
    "but in these macroscopic approaches one has to assume an effective interaction between the cluster and the core  @xcite .",
    "besides , an effective spectroscopic factor ( formation amplitude ) has to be introduced  @xcite which , however , is model - dependent and sensitive to details of the effective interaction .    in a recent letter  @xcite , we have introduced a linear universal decay law ( udl ) starting from the microscopic mechanism of the charged - particle emission .",
    "our aim was to find a general framework valid for all clusters , which may be used in the future as a gauge to probe effective formulas .",
    "this is an interesting subject in itself , but perhaps even more important is that it may help in the ongoing searching of new cluster decay modes from superheavy nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the udl relates the half - lives of monopole radioactive decays with the @xmath2-values of the outgoing particles as well as the masses and charges of the nuclei involved in the decay , reflecting quite well the systematical trend of experimental data . in this paper",
    "we will complete the brief presentation given in ref .",
    "@xcite with details of the construction of the formula and approximations leading to it .",
    "besides , we present the predictions of the udl on the most likely emissions of various clusters .    in section ii is the formalism . in section",

    "( [ life ] ) contains the two - step mechanism mentioned above .",
    "the quantity @xmath26 is the formation amplitude of the decaying particle at distance @xmath19 , which is usually evaluated as the overlap between the mother wave function and the antisymmetrized tensor product of the daughter and cluster wave functions .",
    "the penetrability is proportional to @xmath27 .",
    "this equation is the basis of all microscopical calculations of radioactive decay processes  @xcite .",
    "it is valid for all clusters and for spherical as well as deformed cases .",

    "@xcite it is shown that the expression of eq .",

    "our aim is to find a few quantities that determine the half - life .",
    "expanding in these quantities we hope to be able to find , at the lowest order of perturbation , an expression of the half - life which is as simple as the geiger - nuttall law but valid in general , i.e. , for all isotopic series as well as all type of clusters .",
    "this is possible since eq .",
    "( [ life ] ) itself is valid in general . the number of variables that we have to look for should be small for cases of interest , i.e. , for the decay of medium and heavier nuclei .",
    "in fact most interesting is the predicting power with respect to superheavy nuclei , which are at the center of attention of present experimental activities . with this in mind",

    "the terms @xmath48 and @xmath49 change rather smoothly for the decay cases of interest and may be safely approximated as a constant @xmath50 .    a straightforward conclusion from eq .",
    "( [ gn-1 ] ) is that @xmath51 depends linearly upon @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "still the strong dependence of the formation probability upon the cluster size has to be taken into account by eq .",

    "( [ gn-1 ] ) one readily obtains the relation , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a value of the radius that differs from @xmath19 . the above equation can also be written as , @xmath55 since for a given cluster any nuclear structure would be carried by the terms @xmath56 and @xmath57 in exactly the same fashion , eq .",

    "( [ gn-1 ] ) since the terms @xmath59 have to include the effects that induce the clusterization in the mother nucleus .",
    "this relation holds for the monopole radioactive decays of all clusters and we called it the udl  @xcite .",
    "the relation can be easily generalized to include the @xmath60 decay cases by taking the effects of the centrifugal potential on the barrier penetrability into account  @xcite .",
    "it can be easily recognized that the udl includes the geiger - nuttall law as a special case since @xmath1 remains constant for a given @xmath3-decay chain and @xmath61 . besides , one basic assumption behind the relation ( [ gn-2 ] ) is that one can define a proper radius @xmath62 that leading to a stable formation amplitude @xmath63 for all cluster radioactivities . in the next section",
