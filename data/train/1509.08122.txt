    "a striking aspect of the dynamical evolution of quantum systems that distinguishes it from that of the classical ones is the strong influence on the evolution caused by measurements performed on the system .",
    "indeed , in the extreme case of a frequent enough series of measurements projecting the system back to the initial state , its dynamical evolution gets completely frozen , i.e. , the survival probability to remain in the initial state approaches unity in the limit of an infinite number of measurements .",
    "this effect , known as the quantum zeno effect ( qze ) , was first discussed in a seminal paper by sudarshan and misra in 1977 @xcite , and can be understood intuitively as resulting from the collapse of the wave function corresponding to the initial state due to the process of measurement .",
    "it was later explored experimentally in systems of ions @xcite , polarized photons @xcite , cold atoms @xcite , and dilute bose - einstein condensed gases @xcite . in noisy quantum systems , both the zeno effect and the acceleration due to an anti - zeno effect @xcite have been demonstrated and also proposed for thermodynamical control of quantum systems @xcite , and for quantum computation @xcite .",
    "the so - called quantum zeno dynamics ( qzd ) that generalizes qze is obtained when one applies frequent projective measurements onto a multi - dimensional hilbert subspace @xcite . in this case",
    ", the system does evolve away from its initial state , but nevertheless remains confined in the subspace defined by the projection itself @xcite .",
    "the qzd has been recently demonstrated in an experiment with a rubidium bose - einstein condensate in a five - level hilbert space @xcite .",
    "the evolution of physical observables can also be slowed down by frequent measurements ( operator qze ) even while the quantum state changes randomly with time @xcite .",
    "additionally , the zeno phenomena have assumed particular relevance in applications owing to the possibility of quantum control , whereby specific quantum states ( including entangled ones ) may be protected from decoherence by means of projective measurements @xcite .",
    "indeed , qze is also a physical consequence of the statistical indistinguishability of neighboring quantum states @xcite .",
    "very recently , it has been shown that frequent observation of a small part of a quantum system turns its dynamics from very simple to an exponentially complex one @xcite , thereby paving the way for universal quantum computation .",
    "while in its original qze formulation , the measurement sequence is equally spaced in time , later treatments have considered the case of measurements randomly spaced in time ( stochastic qze ) @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "the survival probability in the projected state becomes itself a random variable that takes on different values corresponding to different realizations of the measurement sequence .",
    "in particular , one would expect that the mean of the survival probability obtained by considering an average over a large ( ideally infinite ) number of realizations of the measurement sequence leads to the result obtained for an evenly spaced sequence , under some constraints ( e.g. , the mean of the time interval between consecutive measurements is finite ) .",
    "an interesting question , relevant both theoretically and experimentally , naturally emerges : is it possible to have realizations of the measurement sequence that give values of the survival probability significantly deviated from the mean ?",
    "how typical / atypical are those realizations ?",
    "are there ways to quantify the probability measures of such realizations ?",
    "these questions assume particular importance in devising experimental protocols that on demand may slow down or speed up efficiently the transitions of a quantum system between its possible states .    in this work , by exploiting tools from probability theory",
    ", we propose a framework that allows an effective addressal of the questions posed above . in particular , we adapt the well - established theory of large deviations ( ld ) to quantify the dependence of the survival probability on the realization of the measurement sequence , in the case of independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "time intervals between consecutive measurements .",
    "our goal is two fold : 1 ) adapt and apply the ld theory to discuss the qze by transferring tools and ideas from classical probability theory to the arena of quantum zeno phenomena , 2 ) analytically predict the corresponding survival probability and exploit it for a new type of control based on the stochastic features of the applied measurements .",
    "the ld theory concerns the asymptotic exponential decay of probabilities associated with large fluctuations of stochastic variables .",
    "originally developed in the realm of probability theory @xcite , an increasing interest in the last years has led to several studies of large deviations in both classical and quantum systems . in the latter case ,",
    "the ld formalism has been discussed in the context of quantum gases @xcite , quantum spin systems @xcite , quantum information theory @xcite , among others .",
    "an interesting recent application pursued in refs .",
    "@xcite has invoked the ld theory to develop a thermodynamic formalism for the study of quantum jump trajectories @xcite of open quantum systems @xcite .",
    "indeed , they have addressed thermodynamic issues for quantum systems , e.g. , quantum stochastic thermodynamics for the quantum trajectories of a continuously monitored forced harmonic oscillator coupled to a thermal reservoir @xcite , the work statistics in a driven two - level system coupled to a heat bath @xcite , and stochastic thermodynamics of a quantum heat engine @xcite .    here , we consider a general quantum system with unitary dynamical evolution that is subject to a sequence of measurements projecting it into a fixed ( initial ) state .",
    "these measurements are separated by time intervals that are i.i.d .",
    "random variables .",
    "we analytically show that in the limit of a large number @xmath0 of measurements , the distribution of the survival probability to remain in the initial state assumes a large - deviation form , namely , a profile decaying exponentially in @xmath0 with a positive multiplying factor , the so - called rate function , which is a function only of the survival probability .",
    "the value at which the function attains its minimum gives out of all possible outcomes the most probable or the typical value of the survival probability .",
    "our analytical results are supported by numerical studies in the case of zeno - protected entangled states .",
    "they show that the presence of disorder in the sequence of time intervals between consecutive measurements is deleterious in reaching the zeno limit .",
    "nevertheless , the disorder does enhance the survival probability when the latter is not exactly one , which , interestingly enough , corresponds to the typical experimental situation .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in section [ model ] , we introduce our framework applied to a generic quantum system with unitary dynamics and subjected to a sequence of projective measurements performed at random times .",
    "we then discuss in section [ survival - probability ] the statistics of the survival probability of the system to remain in an initial pure state . in section [ ld ]",
    ", we consider the case of a @xmath1-dimensional bernoulli probability distribution for the time intervals between consecutive measurements , and analyze the statistics of the survival probability in the limit of a large number of measurements by means of the ld formalism .",
    "we also generalize our results to the case of a continuous probability distribution . in section [ numerics ] ,",
    "we confirm our analytical results by numerical studies on zeno - protected entangled states for a generic three - level quantum system . in section [ qze ] ,",

    "more specifically , we have analytically derived the asymptotic distribution of the survival probability for the system to remain in the initial state when its unitary evolution is combined with a very long sequence of measurements that are randomly spaced in time . the framework allowed us to obtain analytical expressions for the most probable and the average value of the survival probability .",
    "while the most probable value represents what an experimentalist will measure in a single typical implementation of the measurement sequence , the average value corresponds instead to an averaging over a large ( ideally infinite ) number of experimental runs .",
    "therefore , by tuning the probability distribution of the time intervals between consecutive measurements , one can achieve the most probable survival provability , thereby allowing to engineer novel optimal control protocols for the manipulation of , e.g. , atomic population of a specific quantum state .",
    "our analytical predictions have been fully validated against numerical studies of a simple @xmath106-level quantum system and zeno - protected entangled states .",
    "these states are particularly relevant in the context of quantum information science , and therefore need to be well protected from unavoidable environmental decoherence @xcite . for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been shown that an entangled state can be characterized by a zeno time comparable with the one of a separable state by virtue of its interaction with a suitable noisy environment .",
    "since the decoherence may correspond to a continuous monitoring from the environment ( repetitive random measurements ) , our formalism allows one to predict the occupation probability of an arbitrary entangled state by the knowledge of the probability distribution of the system - environment interaction times .",
    "additionally , we have found that the presence of stochasticity in the measurement process may enhance the survival probability in the typical experimental scenario where quantum zeno limit is not achieved .",
    "this suggests new schemes that advantageously exploits disorder in implementing quantum information protocols .",
    "finally , as an outlook , our formalism may be extended to the more general context of qzd where the system dynamics gets confined in a hilbert space , thereby enhancing its complexity exponentially @xcite .",
    "another possible related application is the analysis of the interplay between classical noise arising from external drive and the noise due to the randomness in the measurement sequence , thereby designing new types of noise constraining the hamiltonian dynamics in atomic quantum simulators of many - body systems @xcite .",
