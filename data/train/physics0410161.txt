    "large - scale ordered coherent motions occur in a wide variety of turbulent flows despite existing in a rapidly fluctuating background turbulence  @xcite .",
    "these `` coherent structures '' , which are associated with localized regions of concentrated vorticity , persist for times that are long compared to an eddy turnover time .",
    "the importance of coherent structures in turbulence has become recognized through the use of flow visualization .",
    "examples of coherent structures identified in turbulent flows include hairpin vortices in boundary layer turbulence  @xcite , plumes in turbulent convection , and vortices in turbulent shear flows .",
    "coherent structures play a major role in the transport of mass and momentum , thus affecting transport , drag , and dissipation in turbulent flows . due to their long lifetimes , coherent structures in the atmosphere",
    "strongly influence the exchange of heat , moisture and nutrients between different locations . in industry ,",
    "the prediction and control of transport , drag , and turbulence is important in many processes  @xcite , and in some cases flows can be modified through the control of coherent structures  @xcite .",
    "the emergence of coherent vortices is especially striking in geostrophic turbulence , where the coriolis force plays a dominant role  @xcite . under the effect of rotation and stratification , geophysical flows",
    "develop large and robust coherent structures which can be identified and tracked for time much longer than their characteristic turnover time .",
    "examples of such flows are high and low pressure systems , large vortical structures that are formed in gulf stream meander , mediterranean eddies ( meddies ) , and the earth s jet stream ; all can be observed and tracked by satellite imaging of the atmosphere or the ocean surface ( e.g. see satellite imaging websites  @xcite ) .",
    "large coherent structures are not limited to the earth ; the atmospheres of other planets also reveal structures such as neptune s dark spot and jupiter s zones , belts and great red spot .    three - dimensional ( 3d ) turbulence subjected to strong rotation develops columnar vortical structures aligned with the rotation axis , as observed in the present experiment and in previous laboratory experiments  @xcite .",
    "correlation in this direction becomes large when the coriolis force becomes large compared to inertial forces , and the flow proceeds towards a quasi-2d state .",
    "this two - dimensionalization allows energy to proceed toward larger scales through the inverse energy cascade and toward smaller scales through the forward enstrophy cascade  @xcite , as observed in simulation  @xcite and experiments on rotating  @xcite and non - rotating quasi-2d flows  @xcite .",
    "the cascades of energy and enstrophy lead to a spontaneous appearance of intense localized coherent vortices containing most of the enstrophy of the flow .",
    "vorticity filaments outside of those coherent structures are distorted and advected by the velocity field induced by the vortices .",
    "thus , a rotating turbulent fluid flow can organize itself into large - scale coherent structures that are often long - lived compared to dissipative time scales .",
    "the presence of long - lived coherent structures in turbulent rotating flow has been observed in both experiment  @xcite and in simulation  @xcite .",
    "these structures are larger than the scale of the forcing .",
    "the large - scale coherent structures break the homogeneity of the flow and are thought to dominate the flow dynamics .",
    "the long lifetimes and spatial extent allow coherent structures to play a significant active role in transport processes @xcite .",
    "due to the dynamical importance of coherent structures , any analysis of flow containing these structures should take into account their existence .",
    "one approach to analyze the coherent structures and the dynamics of such flow is to partition it into regions with different dynamical properties .",
    "okubo @xcite derived a criterion to separate flow into a region where strain dominates ( hyperbolic region ) and a region where vorticity dominates ( elliptic region ) .",
    "the same criterion was later re - derived by weiss @xcite and is now known as the okubo - weiss criterion .",
    "the criterion has been widely used to analyze numerical simulations of 2d turbulence . however , as pointed out by basdevant and philipovitch @xcite , the validity of the criterion s key assumption is restricted to the core of the vortices that correspond to the strongest elliptic regions .",
    "this limitation reduces the applicability of a decomposition using this criterion .",
    "another method that has been found useful in analyzing flow fields is proper orthogonal decomposition ( pod ) .",
    "this projects a field onto a set of orthonormal basis functions where successive eigenvectors are obtained by numerically maximizing the amount of energy corresponding to that eigenmode  @xcite .",
    "[ pod is known by other names , including karhunen - lo@xmath0ve decomposition , principal components analysis ( pca ) , and singular value decomposition ( svd ) ; the basis functions are also known as empirical eigenfunctions and empirical orthogonal functions  @xcite , p.86 . ] linear combinations of the basis functions ideally correspond to the coherent structures in the flow . however ,",
    "if the ensemble of fields is homogeneous , the basis functions become fourier modes  @xcite . furthermore , a single mode of the pod corresponds to a full field with structures in a particular spatial arrangement .",
    "if the structures in the field are not stationary , as in the case of our present flow , many modes will therefore be necessary to track the different spatial configurations .",
    "indeed , application of pod to our data resulted in the extraction of the large scale , low amplitude mean flow structure of our field , rather than the continually moving intense coherent structures .",
    "we therefore do not include pod in this paper .",
    "this paper separates a flow into coherent and incoherent components using wavelet transforms  @xcite to extract localized features at different spatial scales .",
    "the most important advantage of the wavelet representation over the more usual fourier representation is the localization of the basis functions .",
    "a fourier analysis is not well suited to pick out localized features such as intense vortices .",
    "the basis functions of a fourier transform are localized in wavenumber space and hence spread out over the entire domain in physical space .",
    "the basis functions of the wavelet transform consist of dilates and translates of a `` mother '' wavelet , which contains multiple frequencies and has compact support ( non - zero values only inside a finite interval ) in physical space .",
    "the basis functions are well localized in both physical and wavenumber space ; hence only a few coefficients suffice to describe localized features of a signal .",
    "the coefficients of the wavelet transform contain not only amplitude but also scale and position of the basis elements .",
    "thus the coefficients can be used to track the size and location of features that are well correlated with the wavelet bases ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the discrete wavelet transform ( dwt ) @xcite has been found to be well suited to analyze intermittent signals and systems containing localized features such as the intense vortices that occur in turbulence @xcite .",
    "farge has extensively applied wavelets to the analysis and computation of turbulent flows  @xcite .",
    "the discrete wavelet _",
    "packet _ transform ( dwpt )  @xcite is a generalization of the dwt ; the possible wavelet packet basis elements are a larger set which include spatial modulation of the mother wavelet .",
    "the advantage of the dwpt is that the choice of basis is adaptable to the signal to be analyzed .",
    "turbulent flow can be considered as a superposition of large - scale coherent motions ,  fine - scale \" incoherent turbulence , and a mean flow with interaction between the three constituents  @xcite . in numerical simulations of 2d turbulence  @xcite , and",
    "more recently 3d turbulence  @xcite , the coherent and incoherent turbulent background components have been separated using wavelet based decompositions operating on the vorticity field . the coherent part , represented by only a small fraction of the coefficients , retained the total flow dynamics and statistical properties , while the incoherent part represented no significant contribution to the flow properties .",
    "this separation of the flow into two dynamically different components suggests that the computational complexity of turbulent flows could be reduced in simulations with coherent structures interacting with a statistically modelled incoherent background  @xcite .",
    "the application , however , has been heretofore primarily limited to results obtained from numerical simulations .    in this paper",

    "an acrylic cylinder ( 48.4 cm tall , 39.4 cm inner diameter ) is fit inside a square acrylic tank ( @xmath1 cm cross section , 60 cm tall ) that has a transparent lid ( fig .  [ apparatus ] )  @xcite .",
    "the tank is filled with distilled water at @xmath2c ( @xmath3 = 0.998 g/@xmath4 , @xmath5 = 9.5 @xmath6 @xmath7/s ) .",
    "the tank and the data acquisition computer are mounted on a table that can be rotated up to 1.0 hz .",
    "+        fluid is injected at the bottom of the tank by pumping water through a hexagonal array of tubes with grid spacing 2.3 cm ; there are 192 sources and 61 sinks , as shown in fig .",
    "[ apparatus ] .",
    "the source tubes are tee - shaped with a 2.5 cm shaft and 2.1 cm horizontal top ( 0.079 cm inside diameter ) [ see inset of fig .",
    "[ apparatus](a ) ] .",
    "each tee is screwed into the distributor .",
    "this design allows us to easily change the type of connector or change the forcing geometry by blocking or modifying sources or sinks .",
    "the tee source geometry was chosen to produce horizontal velocities and to minimize the vertical motions directly driven by the forcing .",
    "further , the orientation of the tees was chosen to minimize cooperation between neighboring tees ; however , it was not possible to eliminate completely a mean flow .",
    "the sinks are 1.27 cm diameter holes in the bottom of the distributor [ fig .",
    "[ apparatus](b ) ] .",
    "the forcing system is versatile and allows us to inject nearly homogeneous turbulence at a scale much smaller than the system size .",
    "flow rates can range up to 1400 @xmath4/s , corresponding to flow velocities up to 8 m / s out of the tees .",
    "this corresponds to a reynolds number of order 10@xmath8 based on the jet velocity and the grid spacing of the tees .",
    "the rossby number , u/2@xmath9l , based upon the same scales is order 50 near the bottom of the tank , near the forcing .",
    "however , the turbulence decays away from the forcing , with increasing height , and becomes more 2d due to the influence of rotation .",
    "the data presented are for 0.4 hz rotation rate and flow rates of 426 @xmath4/s , producing 2.4 m / s velocity jets at the forcing tees .",
    "this corresponds to reynolds and rossby numbers of about @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively , near the forcing .",
    "near the top the rms flow velocity is about 2 cm / s and the maximal characteristic velocity length scale ( twice the @xmath12-folding length of the velocity spatial correlation function ) is about 5 cm ; hence near the top the reynolds number is about 1000 .",
    "the rossby number calculated from characteristic scales is 0.08 , while the local averaged rossby number calculated from the rms vorticity , @xmath13 , at such a flow condition is 0.3 .",
    "the depth of our system thus allows us to observe more 3d ( rossby @xmath14 20 ) or more 2d ( rossby @xmath14 0.3 ) flow without changing control parameters , such as rotation or forcing .",
    "the water is seeded with polystyrene ( @xmath3 = 1.067 g/@xmath4 ) spherical particles with diameters in the range 90 - 106 @xmath15 m .",
    "the small mismatch in density results in a sedimentation terminal velocity of @xmath16 cm / s in the absence of flow , which is insignificant compared to the measured flow velocities .",
    "the density mismatch also causes a lag in the response of the particles in regions of large acceleration @xcite .",
    "we estimate the largest lag to be a 1% difference between the particle velocity and the flow velocity in the vortices at the top of the tank .",
    "a 395 mw , 673 nm diode laser with attached light - sheet optics ( from lasiris ) illuminates the particles in horizontal planes for flow visualization and piv measurements .",
    "it is also possible to rotate the laser and optics by 90@xmath17 to illuminate vertical planes for measurements of the vertical velocities .",
    "the thickness of the sheet is about 1 cm and varies less than 10% across the diameter of the tank .",
    "the laser is fixed to a carriage which allows us to adjust the vertical position of the light - sheet without changing the pumping rate or system rotation rate .",
    "particles are imaged in the rotating frame with a ccd camera ( @xmath18 pixels , 30 frames per second ) mounted above the tank .",
    "the images are grabbed and stored into a memory buffer by a computer on the rotating table . a second",
    ", lower resolution camera with an analog output allows us to view the flow when not grabbing digital images .",
    "the laser pulses were timed so that pairs of pulses were imaged in successive frames of the ccd camera , which had a dead time of 120 @xmath15s between consecutive frames .",
    "the pulse duration was typically 10 ms with a 2 ms dark interval between pulses .",
    "the analog signal from the second camera and power for the equipment on the table are sent through slip rings .",
    "the entire experiment is controlled remotely with a wireless ethernet connection and remote access software ( pc anywhere ) by a computer in the non - rotating laboratory frame .",
    "this allows us to take multiple data sets , adjust the pumping rate , and adjust the position of the light sheet without having to stop the table .    to determine the two - dimensional projection of the velocity field we use a type of digital particle image velocimetry ( dpiv ) known as correlation image velocimetry ( civ )  @xcite .",
    "the civ algorithm uses cross - correlations over small interrogation regions between a pair of consecutive images to find particle displacements over known time intervals to obtain velocities .",
    "the civ algorithm also allows for possible rotations and deformations of the interrogation region to take into account nonlinear particle motions in between images .",
    "the resulting velocity field is interpolated to a uniform regular grid by a cubic spline interpolation .",
    "the vorticity fields are calculated from the coefficients of the spline fit .",
    "we can achieve a maximum data rate of 15 velocity fields per second ( using two images to calculate each velocity field ) .",
    "this time resolution is sufficient for our flow conditions . to capture the dynamics of the flow",
    ", data were taken for 20 s periods ( limited by memory buffer size ) , resulting in 300 fields in a single sequence . to capture statistical information ,",
    "data were taken at 30 s intervals ( longer than measured decay time for our flow ) over ( in most cases ) runs of 50 minutes in duration .",
    "this was sufficient to achieve convergence of statistical quantities .",
    "the resulting velocity and vorticity fields are on a 128@xmath19128 grid with a spatial resolution of 0.30 cm when the whole tank is imaged and 0.19 cm when we zoom - in . testing the civ algorithm against test particle images in known flow fields @xcite , we found that the velocity fields determined by the algorithm have about 2% rms uncertainty .",
    "characteristic decay times for our flow were measured by three different types of experiments . in each experiment , the measured decay time was taken as the @xmath12-folding relaxation time of the mean kinetic energy in the flow .",
    "\\(i ) laminar ( no forcing ) _ spin - down _ experiments were conducted with the tees removed and replaced with a flat horizontal boundary .",
    "the tank was subjected to a sudden 10% decrease in rotation rate after the flow had reached solid - body rotation ( no motion in the rotating tank frame ) .",
    "the predicted decay time of motions in laminar rotating flows with rigid , flat horizontal boundaries subject to small step changes in rotation is given by the _ ekman _ dissipation time , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the depth of the fluid , @xmath5 is the kinematic viscosity and @xmath22 is the angular frequency of the container  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding decay time for the energy in the flow is @xmath23 . for our closed cylindrical tank without topography of depth h = 48.4 cm , @xmath24 @xmath7/s , and a rotation rate of 0.4 hz",
    ", this gives a decay time of the energy as 78 s ; the measured time was 64 s.    \\(ii ) laminar spin - down experiments were conducted in the same way as in ( i ) , except that the tees were installed in the bottom of the tank . the characteristic decay time measured with the tees installed in the bottom of the tank for our flow was 18@xmath253 s.",
    "the reduced laminar spin down time is due to the tees , which cause extra drag and secondary circulations that quickly bring the fluid to solid - body rotation .",
    "\\(iii ) turbulent decay experiments were conducted by abruptly shutting off the forcing . for these experiments ,",
    "the flow was allowed to reach a steady turbulent state ( typically many decay times ) under a constant pumping rate of 426 @xmath4/s and rotation rate of 0.4 hz before abruptly turning off the forcing .",
    "the measured decay time of 13@xmath253 s is long compared to the typical vortex turnover time of 1 s.      to study the transport and mixing properties of our flow we examine numerically the motion of passive scalar point particles and passive scalar fields in the velocity fields obtained from the experiment .",
    "the velocity fields that we measure are a two - dimensional projection of a three - dimensional incompressible flow field .",
    "therefore , they have a non - zero divergence and do not satisfy any fluid dynamical equation of motion .",
    "nonetheless , they can give us useful information regarding the transport properties of the flow .",
    "initial locations are chosen for the point particles , the positions of the particles are updated corresponding to the velocity fields such that @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the position of the particle at time - step @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the velocity of the flow field at time - step @xmath28 at the location of the particle .",
    "each velocity field is interpolated in space by a cubic - spline to calculate the field at the location of a given particle .",
    "the timestep , @xmath30 , is chosen by the courant condition @xcite , which avoids particles jumping over grid points or going too far at a given iteration . for our data",
    "this condition means @xmath31 s @xmath32 1/15 s ; therefore , fields must also be interpolated in time .",
    "the measured velocity fields vary slowly in time compared to our temporal resolution 1/15 s ( measured correlation time is @xmath33 s ; see section  [ decmpvortfields ] ) .",
    "we therefore justify the use of a cubic spline interpolation in time to achieve @xmath30 @xmath34 1/15 s ( typically @xmath35 s ) .",
    "we also examine the time evolution of a passive scalar field advected in the experimental velocity field by numerically integrating the advection - diffusion equation ,    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the passive scalar concentration and @xmath38 is a diffusion coefficient , chosen as necessary for numerical stability of the solution .",
    "the values of @xmath38 used correspond to schmidt numbers ( @xmath38/@xmath5 ) near 0.05 .",
    "the numerical integration is performed using a pseudo - spectral method in polar coordinates based upon methods given in @xcite .",
    "the grid is 128 chebyshev modes in the radial direction and 256 fourier modes in the azimuthal direction .",
    "the velocity field obtained by the civ measurement is interpolated via a cubic spline onto the simulation grid .",
    "the numbers of radial and azimuthal modes were chosen so as to not under - resolve our velocity fields on the nonuniform polar grid .",
    "the singularity at the origin was avoided by choosing chebyshev modes for the radial direction .",
    "the collocation points for chebyshev modes have unit spacing on a circle , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the @xmath41 gridpoint , and @xmath42 the total number of gridpoints .",
    "the gridpoints are clustered at the boundaries and sparse in the center of the domain . by defining the",

    "for an even number of modes the origin , @xmath45 , is skipped .",
    "however , the azimuthal grid is still dense at the origin , which requires us to use a very short time step @xmath47 s to avoid numerical instability .",
    "the experimentally determined velocity fields are then interpolated in time by the method described above for the tracer particle simulation .",
    "the diffusive term is calculated implicitly by a crank - nicholson scheme , separately for the radial and azimuthal directions .",
    "the advection term is calculated explicitly by a predictor - corrector scheme using a third - order adams - bashforth step followed by a fourth - order adams - moulton step @xcite .    to perform the numerical analysis on the decomposed fields we construct a velocity field from a vorticity field .",
    "we make the assumption of 2d flow that the total vorticity is given by the measured vertical vorticity , @xmath48 .",
    "we then use the 2d streamfunction - vorticity relation @xmath49 and solve poisson s equation for the streamfunction @xmath50 using matlab s pde solver .",
    "the derivatives of the streamfunction are then used to calculate the velocity field by the relation @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the unit vector in the vertical direction .",
    "the assumption above is clearly not valid close to the source tees , where the flow is 3d .",
    "however , close to the top of the tank the assumption becomes valid as the flow is quasi-2d . to test the reconstruction and the validity of the 2d approximation",

    "however , on the whole the reconstructed velocity field follows the same behavior as the original field .",
    "near the forcing sources ( tees ) at the bottom of the tank , the flow is very turbulent ( reynolds number @xmath53 ) and three dimensional ( rossby number @xmath54 ) .",

    "the choice of the threshold separating the coherent and incoherent parts of the signal is based upon a measure of the number of significant coefficients @xmath67 , which is the theoretical dimension of the signal , defined by    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the entropy of a discrete signal @xmath70 $ ] ( where @xmath71 $ ] is the set of discrete values of an arbitrary signal @xmath72 ) . in our case ,",
    "the @xmath73 s correspond to the discrete values of our vertical vorticity measurements .",
    "the entropy @xmath69 is defined as    @xmath74    where @xmath75 is the normalized square modulus of the @xmath76 element of the signal , with @xmath42 the number of elements and @xmath77 .",
    "@xmath67 indicates how many of the largest coefficients should be retained to give an efficient , low entropy , representation of the signal .",
    "thus , the decomposition algorithm is the following .",
    "we take the transform of an individual measured vorticity field . for the dwpt",
    ", the best basis is used .",
    "then we find the number of significant coefficients @xmath67 of the transformed vorticity field in the transform basis .",
    "the threshold is therefore based upon the value of the @xmath78 largest coefficient .",
    "coefficients whose modulus is larger ( smaller ) than the threshold correspond to the coherent ( incoherent ) part of the vorticity field .",
    "we then take the inverse transform to get the coherent part in physical space .",
    "the incoherent field is reconstructed by subtracting the coherent from the total field .",
    "the process is then repeated for each of our vorticity fields .",
    "our algorithm contains no adjustable parameters other than the selected wavelet and is based upon the assumption that the flow field has a low entropy component , corresponding to the coherent structures , and a high entropy component , corresponding to an incoherent background .",
    "our algorithm is different than the various iterative algorithms of farge et al .",
    "@xcite and others  @xcite . in the de - noising algorithm described in @xcite ,",
    "successive iterations extract a fraction of the coherent coefficients until a stopping criterion is met .",
    "the fraction of retained coefficients at each step and stopping criterion are adjustable parameters . however ,",
    "the basis of the dwpt can change at each iteration .",
    "the number of coefficients retained therefore loses its meaning since coefficients can be selected from completely different bases .",
    "therefore , we only perform a single iteration without changing the basis for the dwpt . in the algorithm of farge  @xcite , an a priori assumption is made of gaussian white noise incoherent component superimposed upon a non - gaussian component of coherent vortices .",
    "the threshold is then iteratively found to separate the two without adjustable parameters .      to examine the relative efficiency of the wavelet - based decompositions ,",
    "we compare the dwpt and dwt to three other algorithms ; one based upon a fourier transform , a second on basic jpeg compression , and a third on the method developed by okubo @xcite and weiss @xcite .    for the fourier transform algorithm we threshold the coefficients of a 2-dimensional fast fourier transform ( fft ) of our vorticity .",
    "the coherent fields are then constructed via an inverse fft of the largest amplitude coefficients .",
    "the incoherent remainder fields are constructed by subtracting the coherent fields from the original fields .",
    "the basic jpeg algorithm consists of subdividing an image into @xmath79 blocks and taking the discrete cosine transform over the sub - blocks .",
    "the coefficients are arranged based upon the global average of the amplitudes among the sub - blocks .",
    "the average of the amplitudes is used to determine which modes to keep .",
    "after the threshold , each sub - block retains the same number of modes , each in the same position . thus the number of modes retained must be a multiple of the number of sub - blocks which compose the image ( for our @xmath80 fields , this is 256 ) . for more information on the jpeg image compression standard",
    "see reference  @xcite , chapter 3 .",
    "the okubo - weiss criterion splits the fields into elliptic and hyperbolic regions , dominated by vorticity and strain respectively .",

    "the fields shown are constructed with the same number of coefficients for the dwpt , dwt , and fourier transforms , and the closest approximate number for jpeg .    the coherent fields in fig .  [ vortfields ]",

    "[ vortvelstreak](c ) and ( e ) ] .",
    "the dwpt , dwt , and fourier preserve the structure of the total vorticity field .",
    "the okubo - weiss criterion excises primarily the regions of large amplitude vorticity , which generally corresponds to the cores of vortices .",
    "however , it extracts only the cores and leaves behind the peripheries .",
    "the jpeg does poorly with so few coefficients ; it barely picks out some of the stronger vortices in the field .    for the same number of coefficients , 2.4% ,",
    "the dwpt and dwt do a better job of extracting structure in the fields than the fourier decomposition , which leaves more structure behind in the incoherent field ( fig .",
    "[ vortfields ] [ movie  @xcite ] ) .",
    "the jpeg incoherent field is large amplitude because of the few coefficients retained in the coherent field .",
    "the incoherent fields resulting from the dwpt , dwt , and the fourier are mostly devoid of large - scale structures and are much smaller in amplitude .",
    "the incoherent fields are also poorly correlated in time and are devoid of large scale structures or any other feature which can be tracked by eye ( fig .",
    "[ vortfields ] and associated movie ) .",
    "the okubo - weiss criterion selects the centers of the vortices where vorticity dominates strain .",
    "this accounts for a large portion of the enstrophy .",
    "it extracts about 74% of the enstrophy in the vorticity dominated regions , which cover about 40% ( not coefficients ) of the flow .",
    "however , the method leaves behind holes in the vorticity field that act as coherent structures and are often surrounded by large values of vorticity .",
    "the resulting `` incoherent '' field thus retains coherent properties .",
    "the okubo - weiss criterion also does poorly in recovering the statistics of the total field , as shown in table [ table1 ] .",
    "furthermore , the decomposition shown in fig .  [ vortfields ] was performed without regard to the okubo - weiss validity criterion , which restricts the application of the criterion to the very centers of the vortices or regions of very large vorticity @xcite .",
    "if the validity criterion is applied , much less is retained in the coherent field , and the incoherent field ends up with large values of vorticity .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of vorticity has broad wings ( fig .  [ pdfspec ] ) , which correspond to the large vorticity values that occur in the coherent vortices and vorticity filaments .",
    "the preference for cyclonic ( positive vorticity ) structures over anti - cyclonic structures appears as a large positive skewness ( see also table  [ table1 ] or  [ table2 ] ) . while the pdf for the dwpt and dwt coherent vorticity field are nearly the same as that for the total vorticity field , the pdf for the corresponding incoherent field is narrower and more symmetric , indicating the lack of high intensity structures .",
    "consider the enstrophy spectrum of the vorticity fields , as shown in fig .",
    "[ pdfspec ] ( b ) .",
    "it is clear from the enstrophy spectra of the total field that most of the enstrophy is contained in long wavelengths ( small @xmath64 ) .",
    "this agrees well with the observation of the vorticity fields and the dominance of large structures with large amplitude vorticity . the enstrophy spectrum , shown in fig .",
    "[ pdfspec ] , does not contain a well defined scaling region corresponding to a cascade of enstrophy .",
    "a cascade would not be expected for our quasi-2d flow , which is forced by the broad - band 3d turbulence in the bottom of the tank rather than by injection of energy at a single well - defined wavenumber .",
    "the presence of large structures which extend well into the 3d region alone tells us that we must have a broad spectrum energy injection .",
    "the coherent field contains the same large structures that are present in the total field .",
    "accordingly , the enstrophy spectrum of the coherent field matches that of the total field at long wavelength [ fig .",
    "[ pdfspec ] ( b ) ] .",
    "the incoherent field contains negligible enstrophy at large scales , indicating the lack of large scale features .",
    "this is apparent in the vorticity decomposition ( see fig .  [ vortfields ] ) .",
    "the incoherent field has only small structures and is the dominant contribution to the enstrophy at large @xmath64 .",
    "the wavelet - based and the fourier decompositions also retain the spatial and temporal correlations in the coherent field , as fig .",
    "[ corplots ] illustrates with the dwpt and dwt yielding almost the same results .",
    "the long time correlation is in part due to the presence of long lived coherent structures . in contrast , for the incoherent field the spatial and temporal correlations are short ranged , indicating the absence of large scale and long - lived structures .",

    ", the particles are advected around a large portion of the tank .",
    "the motion of the particles depends on their location in the flow .",
    "for example , a particle can spend time caught in a vortex , following the motion of the vortex as it meanders slowly in a localized region of the tank [ path in upper right of fig .",
    "[ tracerpaths ] ( a ) ] .",
    "occasionally the particle will escape from a vortex and then be carried by a high velocity jet , which can transport a particle large distances in a short time . a particle may then be captured by a vortex [ e.g. path ending in lower right of fig .",

    "the incoherent fields make no significant contribution to the transport properties ; rather , particles are confined to a small region , as shown in the inset in fig .",
    "[ tracerpaths ] ( a ) .",
    "this is due to the rapid decorrelation in time of the incoherent fields .",
    "the rapid fluctuations cause the tracers to jiggle around and the scaling of the mean squared squared displacement of the tracers in the incoherent fields approaches that of a random walk .",

    "[ corplots ] ) .",
    "similar results were obtained for the dwt and fourier methods .",
    "our results agree well with those of beta et al .",
    "@xcite who , using the dwt , found that the coherent field is responsible for the mixing in a numerically simulated 2d turbulent flow .",
    "we find that flow which is strongly forced near the bottom of a deep rapidly rotating tank evolves with increasing height in the tank from 3d turbulence into rotation - dominated turbulence .",
    "this is due to the competition between the turbulent forcing which is 3d , and the rotation which tends to two - dimensionalize the flow . near the forcing the turbulent velocities are large and the flow is 3d .",
    "away from the forcing the spatial decay of turbulence allows the rotation to become increasingly important with increasing height .",
    "motions of the particles in the flow are more organized in the horizontal plane near the top , consistent with two - dimensional columnar vortices .",
    "the flow in the rotationally dominated ( rossby number @xmath82 ) region of our tank has a strongly non - gaussian vorticity pdf and exhibits properties of 2d turbulence , such as large - scale long - lived coherent vortices , vortex filamentation , and merger .",
    "the vertical component of vorticity describes the flow well near the top where the flow is quasi-2d as a consequence of the rotation .",
    "we are thus able to use the projected flow field as measured in a horizontal plane for analysis with wavelet and fourier - based decompositions .",
    "we have shown that wavelet based transforms can be used to separate the coherent structure - containing quasi-2d turbulent flow into a non - gaussian coherent component represented by as few as 3% of the large - amplitude , low entropy coefficients of the transform and a nearly gaussian incoherent component , represented by the remaining small - amplitude , high entropy coefficients .",
    "we are able to obtain this result without an a priori assumption of gaussianity or non - gaussianity of the two components .",
    "the discrete wavelet packet transform ( dwpt ) and the discrete wavelet transform ( dwt ) yield very similar results , despite the adaptability of the dwpt basis .",
    "the dwt is therefore made preferable by its faster computation [ @xmath65 versus @xmath66 operations ] .    because our flow fields contain compact structures , the localized basis functions of the dwpt and dwt outperform fourier and jpeg decompositions . both the dwpt and dwt have more rapid convergence of the statistics of the extracted coherent component toward that of the total flow .",
    "the rapid convergence of the skewness and kurtosis of the vorticity pdf suggest that the wavelet based methods have efficiently captured the coherent structures .",
    "the fourier and jpeg converge much more slowly and are thus unable to efficiently capture the large higher moments of the vorticity pdf .",
    "this suggests that the fourier and jpeg methods have not really extracted the coherent structures despite the appealingly smooth visual appearance of the structures in the coherent field of the fourier .",
    "indeed , the superior performance of the dwt over the jpeg is exploited by the emerging next generation jpeg2000 image compression standard , which uses a bi - orthogonal dwt  @xcite .",
    "the incoherent remainder of both the dwpt and dwt converge rapidly towards gaussian statistics , while incoherent remainders of the fourier and jpeg do not converge to any value .",
    "the coherent components of the dwpt and dwt retain all of the properties of the total field , including the large - scale structures , shape of the vorticity pdf , long spatial and temporal correlations , and transport properties .",
    "further , the coherent component contains the large skewness and kurtosis of the pdf which are due to the coherent structures .",
    "in contrast , the incoherent remainder has only small - scale short - lived features and does not contribute significantly to the transport .",
    "thus in analysis of flow dynamics and transport , it may be sufficient only to consider the coherent component .",
