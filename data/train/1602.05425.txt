    "@xmath113 functional follows the @xmath26 curve closely .",

    "we note that in the past @xmath113 functional has been compared with the exact @xmath26 and our work confirms the previous results@xcite .",
    "however we have also shown how other functionals behave in comparision to the exact behavior .",
    "we finally mention that in the past an attempt has been made to model @xmath26 by peach et .",
    "to conclude , we have presented a comprehensive study of adiabatic connection using an accurate two - electron wavefunction in conjunction with the constrained search method .",
    "the accuracy of our study is indicated by the fact that the chemical potential remains constant as a function of the adiabatic connection parameter @xmath2 and the kinetic energy component @xmath114 is also determined precisely through hellmann - feynman theorem applied with the wavefunction used .",
    "we have constructed the external potential for different values of @xmath2 and shown that the major component of it comes from the hartree potential for a given ground - state density .",
