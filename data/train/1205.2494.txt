    "it was experimentally observed in the 1960s that a quark of high generation can decay into a quark of low generation :      a diagram of the mixed quark decay .",
    "( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/user:army1987/quark )    this phenomenon , referred to as _ the mixed quark decay _ in this article , has been thought to be explained by the ckm theory @xcite in which it is assumed that the weak interaction pairs are @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 rather than the more natural pairs @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where @xmath8=v\\left[\\begin{matrix } d\\cr s \\cr b \\end{matrix}\\right]\\ ] ] with @xmath9 being the ckm matrix @xmath10.\\ ] ] for example , via weak interaction , instead of decaying into @xmath11 , @xmath12 decays into @xmath13 , and hence decays into @xmath14 , @xmath15 or @xmath11 with the relative probability @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively . in this theory , the ckm matrix @xmath9 is simply an input parameter whose actual value must be determined by experiments , but one thing is clear : @xmath9 has to be unitary _ exactly_. a great success of this theory is the prediction of the third generation of quarks , for which kobayashi and maskawa shared one half of the 2008 nobel physics prize in physic @xcite .    from the particle data group @xcite , the best experimental determination for the magnitudes of the ckm matrix elements",
    "is @xmath19 @xmath20 . }",

    "if we took the experimentally determined value of @xmath24 , i.e. , @xmath25 , we would have @xmath26    the phases of the ckm matrix elements determine the amount of cp violation . with the observed amount of cp violation taken into account , the currently best known  standard",
    "\" fit for the ckm matrix elements in the sense of chau and keung @xcite is @xmath27 @xmath28 .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that only the two highlighted entries are not nearly being real numbers .",
    "because of this observation , _",
    "@xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 shall be assumed to be real numbers hereafter_.    the assumption that @xmath12 interacts with @xmath34 ( rather than @xmath11 ) via weak interaction is made purely for explaining the mixed quark decay .",
    "there is no theoretical reason why this must be so . in any case , this assumption is mysterious and now the experimental data strongly suggests that it is incorrect . for example , the norm square of the 3rd column should be exactly @xmath35 ; however , based on the experimental data for the 3rd column , a simulation of any size @xmath36 shows that this norm square has an average @xmath37 , a standard deviation @xmath38 , and is less than @xmath39 more than @xmath40 of time .",
    "it is perhaps not a secret among some experts that the ckm theory is less than accurate .",
    "however , to reject the ckm theory , one must provide an alternative theory which is both theoretically sound as well as quantitatively more accurate .",
    "a major message in this article is that such a theory indeed exists .",
    "in a recent article @xcite of this author , it was shown that one can indeed derive the existence of quarks and leptons provided that one is willing to make a new modification for the twin pillars of fundamental physics , as shown in the last stage of the following chain of modifications :    _ classical mechanics _",
    "+ _ galilean structure _ @xmath41 _ quantum theory _",
    "+ _ galilean structure _ @xmath42 _ quantum theory _ + _ lorentz structure _ @xmath43 _ quantum theory _",
    "+ _ euclidean jordan algebra_.    this new modification is comparatively conservative because lorentz structure is a secondary structure hidden inside euclidean jordan algebra , rather than an approximation to it . with this new modification , quarks and leptons , the four fundamental forces and the broken electric - weak symmetry , matter generations , and other experimentally found phenomena , appear naturally in the theoretical framework .",
    "moreover , a short - range 5th fundamental force accompanying gravity is predicted .",
    "this 5th force is predicted to violate the cp symmetry and transform quarks among its various generations , so it immediately predicts mixed quark decay and the related cp violation .",
    "for example , since @xmath15 decays to @xmath14 via the 5th force and @xmath14 decays to @xmath44 via the weak force , @xmath15 must decay to @xmath44 .",
    "the theoretical framework offered above sounds very simple and leaves no mysteries behind , but in order for this to be a valid theory it must be able to withstand quantitative checks with experiments .",
    "since the precise mathematical form for the 5th force is not available at the moment , one has to make some reasonable assumptions on the 5th force in order to proceed . with this in mind , by using simple rules in quantum mechanics one can derive the following _ inexact _ formulae for @xmath45 , @xmath0 , @xmath46 : @xmath47 here , @xmath48 means the complex conjugate , and",
    "@xmath49 is some unknown complex constant . to test the accuracy of these formulae",
    ", one takes as input data the experimentally determined magnitude for the matrix entries entered into the right hand side of formulae ( [ formula ] ) , but with this sign convention chosen : diagonal entries are all positive , @xmath50 and @xmath51 . to be more precise , we take @xmath52 @xmath53 } \\nonumber   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath54 ( page 159 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) as our input data , then compute @xmath45 , @xmath0 and @xmath46 according to formulae ( [ formula ] ) . note that @xmath46 can not be computed from the formulae because @xmath49 is unknown , however , its standard deviation , which is independent of the actual value of @xmath49 , can be computed . in our actual computation",
    "we set @xmath55 .    in the ckm theory , the orthogonality for the first two columns and first two rows plus the unity of the norm square of the 3rd row yields the following very accurate formulae for @xmath56 , @xmath31 and @xmath45 : @xmath57 as the input data for the computation via formulae ( [ ckmformula ] ) , we take @xmath58 as before and @xmath59 , see page 159 in ref .",
    "@xcite .    by performing a numerical test with a sample size @xmath60 ,",
    "one gets the following result :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     -15pt note that the uncertainties in the output come from the uncertainties of the experimental data for the matrix entries entered into the right hand side of formulae ( [ formula ] ) and ( [ ckmformula ] ) . in the tests ,",
    "each ckm matrix entry on the right hand side of formulae ( [ formula ] ) or formulae ( [ ckmformula ] ) is assumed to be a gaussian random variable with the normal distribution determined by the experimental data .",
    "for example , @xmath29 is assumed to be the gaussian random variable with the normal distribution having average equal to @xmath61 and standard deviation equal to @xmath62 .    in the 5th force",
    "based predictions , the precision is good , so is the accuracy except for @xmath21 .",
    "the inaccuracy for @xmath21 has a known reason : the unknown complex constant @xmath49 in formulae ( [ formula ] ) was set to be zero in the numerical test .",
    "in contrast , in the ckm based predictions , neither precision nor accuracy fares well , especially for @xmath63 and @xmath64 .    in summary , the _ inaccurate _ formulae deduced from the 5th force produces a much better result than the ckm theory s _ accurate _ formulae .",
    "thus , considering this result , as well as observation that the 5th force theory is natural and is also part of a bigger natural theory proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the 5th force theory does a better job than the ckm theory at predicting mixed quark decay .",
    "the goal of this section is to derive formulae ( [ formula ] ) based on the 5th force and the weak force . here",
    "the 5th force transforms up quarks ( down quarks respectively ) among their different generations , but the weak force is still the one in the classical standard model , i.e. , it transforms up quarks and down quarks into each other only in the same generation .",
    "in contrast , in the ckm theory , since the mixed quark decays is solely due to the weak force , the weak force must be assumed to transform a up quark into a linear supoposition of down quarks from various generations .",
    "apparently these are two conflicting theories for mixed quark decays .    for the purpose in this article , we are only interested in computing the following transition amplitude matrix : @xmath65.\\ ] ] here @xmath66 denotes the total transition amplitude ( due to both the weak force and the 5th force ) for quark @xmath67 spontaneously decaying into quark @xmath11 . note that the matrix @xmath68 is a scalar multiple of @xmath9 up to the complex conjugation of some entries . for the purpose of comparing with @xmath9 ,",
    "hereafter we shall assume that @xmath69 modulo the complex conjugation of some entries .",
    "the precise form of the 5th force is not known at the moment , otherwise one would be able to compute @xmath68 directly . in spite of this fact , based on rules in quantum theory and some plausible physics assumptions , one can still derive some useful information .    as a simple exercise ,",
    "let us derive the following formula @xmath70 which corresponds to the simplest identity in formulae ( [ formula ] ) .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the weak force transition amplitude between the up quark and the down quark in each generation is a same positive number @xmath71 when suitable relative phases are chosen .",
    "then @xmath72 here @xmath73 is the transition amplitude contributed from the decaying process involving @xmath74 first decaying to @xmath44 via the 5th force , @xmath75 is the transition amplitude contributed from the decaying process involving @xmath12 first decaying to @xmath44 via the 5th force , and @xmath76 is the transition amplitude contributed from the decaying process involving @xmath12 first decaying to @xmath74 via the 5th force .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that @xmath77 have the same amplitude and are real , then @xmath78 . among the four possible choices of signs ,",
    "only this one @xmath79 produces result that matches the experiment well , so @xmath80 .",
    "then @xmath81 , which is essentially formula ( [ simplef ] ) .",
    "note that , because of the sign ambiguity one actually has four formulae for @xmath82 , but the one we chose is the one that matches experiment the best .    to derive the complicated identities in formulae ( [ formula ] ) ,",
    "let us introduce a few more notations .",
    "denote by @xmath83 the 5th force transition amplitude from quark @xmath67 to quark @xmath11 .",
    "here @xmath67 and @xmath11 are either all up quarks or all down quarks .",
    "let @xmath84 and @xmath85    these are of course the simple transition amplitudes . for the convenience of readers , some of these transition amplitudes have been recorded in the following diagram : @xmath86    in the next step , we use the basic rules in quantum mechanics to figure out the interesting transition amplitudes in terms of the preceding simple transition amplitudes . of course",
    ", we must ignore gravity , the electric force and the strong force in our analysis here .",
    "these transition amplitudes are computed according to the rules in quantum mechanics .",
    "for example , to compute @xmath82 , one notes that there are exactly two routes from @xmath12 to @xmath15 , one via @xmath74 which contributes @xmath87 to @xmath82 and one via @xmath11 which contributes @xmath88 to @xmath82 , so @xmath89 as another example , to compute @xmath90 , one notes that there is only one route from @xmath11 to @xmath74 , i.e. , the one via @xmath15 which contributes @xmath91 to @xmath90 , so @xmath92 ( the route via @xmath12 is not available because @xmath11 can not spontaneously decay to @xmath12 which is heavier than @xmath11 . ) a few more exercise of this kind yields the following equation @xmath93\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the matrix @xmath68 at the moment is useless as far as predictions are concerned .",
    "however , one notes that any match with experiment has to be more than just numerical , it must meet all reasonable physics expectations , too .",
    "for example , with suitable relative phases fixed , it is very reasonable to expect that , up to sign , @xmath94 ( say @xmath95 ) , @xmath96 ( say @xmath97 ) , and @xmath98 ( say @xmath99 ) , @xmath100 , @xmath101 ( say @xmath102 ) .",
    "further , if we assume hydrogen atom s spontaneous transition amplitudes hold roughly , we expect @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "this last physics expectation is reasonable in view of ref .",
    "@xcite in which the elementary particles are proposed to be modeled on the hydrogen atom . with this in mind , a numerical match with @xmath105 which is either nearly zero or too big would not be considered as a match on physics ground .    in the further analysis , it shall be assumed @xmath106 then @xmath107\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath108 .",
    "note that , there are seven variables here : @xmath95 , @xmath97 , @xmath99 , @xmath91 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 , so @xmath68 has predictive power now , that is because , with the identification of @xmath68 with @xmath9 , this form of @xmath68 yields the complicated identities in formulae ( [ formula ] ) .",
    "note also that , if @xmath46 and @xmath0 are both positive , the match with experiments is also good numerically , but then the ratio @xmath112 is very tiny , so has to be rejected on physics ground ; on the other hand , if @xmath46 and @xmath0 are both negative , the match with experiments is good both numerically and on physics ground because @xmath113 is indeed close to @xmath35 in this case .",
    "thanks to the more refined experimental data existing today , the mixed quark decay is better explained by a 5th force based theory than the ckm theory . since the 5th force is quite weak , its effect is very small so that only in certain special cases such as the one examined here can one possibly find a serious mismatch between the standard model and experiments .",
    "of the decay of muons is due to the 5th force . in view of the amount ( @xmath114 ) of cp violation",
    "observed for the decay of kaons , the actual amount of cp violation in the decay of muons is about @xmath115 , i.e. , about @xmath116 , which is too small to be observed . ]    the program proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite is based on a conservative modification of the twin pillars of fundamental physics .",
    "the research presented here provides a successful quantitative test of this program , and in the process serious flaws in the established ckm theory are exposed .",
