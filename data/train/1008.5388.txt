    "with recent experimental developments on cold atoms in optical lattices , the interest in the bosonic hubbard model  @xcite has dramatically increased .",
    "this model is characterized by a superfluid - to - mott quantum phase transition for large onsite repulsion and integer values of the density of particles . in actual experiments",
    "the atoms are confined to prevent them from leaking out of the lattice .",
    "this is currently achieved by applying a spatially dependent magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "a parabolic potential is added into the hubbard model  @xcite to mimic the effect of the magnetic field .",
    "therefore , the resulting model does not exhibit a true superfluid - to - mott transition , since mott regions always coexist with superfluid regions .",
    "this was predicted theoretically  @xcite , and later confirmed experimentally  @xcite .",
    "recently , we have proposed a new confining technique  @xcite where the atoms are confined via a hopping integral that decreases as a function of the distance from the center of the lattice . since the confinement of the particles is due to the hopping or off - diagonal operators , we called it _ off - diagonal confinement _ ( odc ) , as opposed to the conventional diagonal confinement ( dc ) which makes use of a parabolic confinement potential that is reflected in the density profile  @xcite .",
    "for large on - site repulsion the odc model exhibits pure mott phases at commensurate filling while at other fillings it exhibits more populated condensates than the dc model .",
    "another advantage of odc is that simple energy measurements can provide insights into the mott gap , while the presence of the harmonic potential may renormalize the value of the gap with respect to the uniform case  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we show that the odc method can also lead to lower temperatures than the dc method for a wide range of parameters . producing low temperatures in experiments",
    "is challenging , especially with fermions for which laser cooling is not as efficient as for bosons . in current experiments ,",
    "fermions are cooled down by convection in the presence of cold bosons , leading to bose - fermi mixtures  @xcite .",
    "achieving lower temperatures for bosonic condensates will therefore result in colder bose - fermi mixtures .",
    "this manuscript is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we define our model and describe our methods .",
    "the hard - core limit is studied in section iii in order to illustrate analytically how odc produces temperatures that are lower than those obtained with dc .",
    "this will also serve to benchmark the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations we use for analyzing the general soft - core case . in section",
    "iv we present the algorithm we use for qmc simulations , and we propose a method for measuring the entropy with this algorithm .",
    "results for the soft - core case are presented in section v. finally we conclude in section vi .",
    "we consider bosons confined to a one - dimensional optical lattice with @xmath0 sites and lattice constant @xmath1 .",
    "the hamiltonian takes the form : @xmath2 the creation and annihilation operators @xmath3 and @xmath4 satisfy bosonic commutation rules , @xmath5= \\big[a_i^\\dagger , a_j^\\dagger\\big]=0 $ ] , @xmath6=\\delta_{ij}$ ] , and @xmath7 is the number of bosons on site @xmath8 .",
    "the sum @xmath9 runs over all distinct pairs of first neighboring sites @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the hopping integral between @xmath8 and @xmath12 .",
    "the parameter @xmath13 is the strength of the local on - site interaction , and @xmath14 describes the curvature of the external trapping potential .    in this work",
    "we consider the grand - canonical partition function , @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath18 the temperature .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath19 controls the average number of particles , @xmath20 , with @xmath21 .",
    "the conventional dc model is obtained by setting @xmath22 for all pairs of first neighboring sites @xmath10 , and using @xmath23 . for this model",
    "the value of @xmath0 is irrelevant as long as it is sufficiently large to contain the whole gas .",
    "the odc model is obtained by setting @xmath24 and using a hopping integral @xmath11 that decreases as a function of the distance from the center of the lattice , and vanishes at the edges . for this model",
    ", @xmath0 fully determines @xmath11 as described below .",
    "typically the temperature is not a control parameter in cold - atoms experiments , and once laser cooling has been performed , the system has a fixed entropy which can be considered the control parameter .",
    "then the temperature can be estimated numerically knowing the isentropies of the system  @xcite .",
    "therefore , our strategy for determining which of the two confining methods can achieve the lowest temperature is based on switching adiabatically from dc to odc , so the entropy is conserved .",
    "then we determine the temperatures @xmath25 and @xmath26 of the dc and odc systems by equating the entropies    we will consider an experiment in which a _ fixed _ number @xmath27 of atoms is loaded into an optical lattice with a dc trap , described by eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) with parameters @xmath22 , @xmath28 ( as in ref .",
    "we use @xmath29 in order to ensure the confinement of the whole gas .",
    "then , we adiabatically switch to the odc trap by slowly varying @xmath11 and @xmath14 to @xmath30 with @xmath31 , and @xmath24 ( as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , keeping @xmath27 and @xmath13 the same .    however ,",
    "in our calculation , it is actually more convenient to control the temperature than the entropy . thus we consider both dc and odc systems for a set temperatures @xmath18 , and measure the corresponding entropies , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "then , knowing the initial temperature @xmath25 , the final temperature @xmath26 can be extracted graphically by imposing the equality , @xmath34 , as described in the next section .",
    "the hard - core limit ( @xmath35 ) of the model can be solved analytically .",
    "these exact results provide a solid benchmark for our study of the general soft - core case in the next section .",
    "we follow here the method used by rigol  @xcite . in the hard - core limit , the @xmath13 term in ( [ hamiltonian ] )",
    "can be dropped if the standard bosonic commutation rules are replaced by @xmath5=\\big[a_i^\\dagger , a_j^\\dagger\\big]= \\big[a_i^{\\phantom\\dagger},a_j^\\dagger\\big]=0 $ ] for @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , and @xmath38 . with this algebra",
    ", the model ( [ hamiltonian ] ) reduces to @xmath39 which describes hard - core bosons . by performing a jordan - wigner transformation ,",
