    "the screened coulomb potentials , @xmath5 of which hulthn and yukawa potentials are two simple representatives , have been of considerable interest in the context of many physical systems and a considerable amount of work has been devoted to study their numerous features over the years .",
    "z is identified as the atomic number when these are used in the context of atomic systems , while the screening parameter @xmath6 has different significance in different branches .",
    "the hulthn potential [ 1 ] is one of the most important short - range potentials and has been used in the nuclear and particle physics [ 2 - 5 ] , atomic physics [ 6 - 7 ] , solid - state physics [ 8 - 9 ] , chemical physics [ 10 ] , etc .",
    "this is also a special case of the eckart potential .",
    "the yukawa potential [ 11 ] , on the other hand , has found applications in approximating the effects of screening of nuclear charges by plasmas ( commonly termed as the debye - hckel potential ) , shielding effect in the atoms and also in the solid - state physics ( as the thomas - fermi potential ) , etc .",
    "these two potentials have several similarities ; e.g. , they are both coulomb - like for small @xmath7 and decay monotonically exponentially to zero for large @xmath7 . another distinctive feature of these potentials ( in contrast to the coulomb potentials ) is the presence of limited number of bound states characterized by the presence of the screening parameters ; i.e. , bound states exist only for certain values of the screening parameter below a threshold limit ( e. g. , for the yukawa potential , this value has been accurately estimated as 1.19061227 @xmath80.00000004 [ 12 ] in atomic units ) .",
    "the former has the additional special property that it offers exact analytical solutions for @xmath9 states only , not for the higher partial waves [ 13 ] .",
    "many formally attractive and efficient formalisms have been proposed for accurate determination of the eigenvalues , eigenfunctions as well as for the values of the critical screening parameters differing in complexity , accuracy and efficiency .",
    "the most notable of these are the variational calculations employing a multitude of basis functions [ 14 - 18,12 ] , combined pad approximation and perturbation theory [ 19 - 21 ] , shifted 1/n approximation along with many of its variants [ 22 - 27 ] , dynamical - group approach [ 28 ] , supersymmetric quantum mechanics [ 29 ] , numerical calculations [ 30 - 31,18 ] and other works [ 32 - 33 ] .    in the past few years",
    ", the generalized pseudospectral ( gps ) method has been proved to be a very powerful and efficient tool to deal with the static and dynamic processes of many - electron atomic / molecular systems characterized by the coulomb singularities ( see , for example , [ 34 - 37 ] and the references therein ) .",
    "recently it has also been successfully applied to the power - law and logarithmic potentials [ 38 ] , as well as the spiked harmonic oscillator with stronger singularity [ 39 ] .",
    "one of the objectives of this article is to extend and explore the regions of validity of this formalism to a different class of singularities , namely the screened coulomb potentials thus covering a broader range of physical systems . in an attempt to assess the performance and its applicability to such systems , we have computed all the 55 eigenstates ( 1@xmath1010 ) of the hulthn and yukawa potentials and compared them with the available literature data wherever possible with an aim to study the spectra of these systems systematically .",
    "it may be noted that although many accurate results are available for these potentials in the weaker coupling region and for the lower states , there is a lack of good quality results in the stronger region and for the higher states . in this work",
    ", we pay special attention to both of these issues .",
    "screening parameters of arbitrary field strengths ( covering both weak and strong limits of interaction ) have been considered for given values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 quantum numbers . to this end",
    ", accurate calculations have been performed on the eigenvalues , expectation values and radial probability densities of these two systems . as a further stringent test of the method",
    ", we calculate some very high excited states ( up to @xmath1 ) of these two systems which have been examined never before .",
    "as will be evident in a later section , this method is indeed capable of producing excellent quality results comparable in accuracy to the other existing literature data for both these systems and in many cases ( especially in the stronger regions of coupling ) , indeed offers the best results .",
    "the article is organized as follows : section ii presents an outline of the theory and the method of calculation .",
    "section iii gives a discussion on the results while section iv makes some concluding remarks .",
    "in this section , we present an overview of the gps formalism within the nonrelativistic framework for solving the radial schrdinger equation ( se ) of a single - particle hamiltonian containing a hulthn or yukawa term in the potential .",
    "only the essential steps are given and the relevant details may be found elsewhere ( [ 34 - 39 ] and the references therein ) . unless otherwise mentioned ,",
    "atomic units are employed throughout this article .",
    "the radial se can be written in the following form , @xmath13 \\psi_{n,\\ell}(r ) = e_{n,\\ell}\\ \\psi_{n,\\ell}(r)\\ ] ] where @xmath14 or @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath6 denote the respective screening parameters whereas @xmath11 and @xmath12 signify the usual radial and angular momentum quantum numbers respectively .",
    "use of a scaling transformation , @xmath17 gives the following well - known relation , @xmath18 thus it suffices to study only the @xmath19 case and this fact has been used in this work .",
    "the usual finite difference or finite element discretization schemes often require a large number of grid points to achieve good accuracy and convergence , often because of their uniform nature .",
    "the gps formalism , in contrast , can give nonuniform and optimal spatial discretization with a significantly smaller number of grid points allowing a denser mesh at smaller @xmath7 and a coarser mesh at larger @xmath7 while maintaining similar accuracies in both regions .",
    "in addition , this is also computationally orders of magnitude faster .",
    "the first step is to approximate a function @xmath20 defined in the interval @xmath21 $ ] by the n - th order polynomial @xmath22 such that , @xmath23 and this ensures that the approximation is _ exact _ at the _ collocation points _",
    "@xmath24 , i.e. , @xmath25 here , we have used the legendre pseudospectral method having @xmath26 , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 are obtained from the roots of the first derivative of the legendre polynomial @xmath29 with respect to @xmath30 , i.e. , @xmath31 the @xmath32 in eq .",
    "( 6 ) are called the cardinal functions and given by , @xmath33 these have the unique property , @xmath34 .",
    "now the semi - infinite domain @xmath35 $ ] can be mapped onto the finite domain @xmath21 $ ] by the transformation @xmath36 .",
    "the following algebraic nonlinear mapping , @xmath37 may be used , where l and @xmath38 are termed as the mapping parameters .",
    "now , introduction of the following relation , @xmath39 followed by a symmetrization procedure leads to the transformed hamiltonian as below , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is given by , @xmath42 the advantage is clear ; this leads to a _",
    "matrix eigenvalue problem which can be readily solved to give accurate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions by using some standard available routines .",
    "note that @xmath43 for the particular transformation used here and finally one obtains the following set of coupled equations ,    @xmath44 a_j = ea_{j'},\\ \\ \\ \\ j=1,\\ldots , n-1,\\ ] ]    where @xmath45^{1/2 } \\psi(r(x_j))\\ \\left [ p_n(x_j)\\right]^{-1}.\\ ] ] and the symmetrized second derivatives of the cardinal function , @xmath46 are given by , @xmath47^{-1 } d^{(2)}_{j'j }   \\left[r'(x_j)\\right]^{-1},\\ ] ] with @xmath48 a large number of tests have been performed to check the accuracy and reliability of the method so as to produce `` stable '' results with respect to the variation of the mapping parameters . in this way , a consistent set of parameter sets were chosen . for the problems at hand @xmath49 and @xmath50 seemed appropriate for all the states considered in this work while @xmath51 values were varied as required ( see later ) .",
    "the results are reported only up to the precision that maintained stability .",
    "it may be noted that all our results are _ truncated _ rather than _ rounded - off_.",
    "let us first examine the convergence of the calculated energy eigenvalues . as an illustration ,",
    "consider the following two cases of @xmath52 states of the hulthn potential which offer exact analytical results : ( a ) the ground state with @xmath53 ( high screening ) and ( b ) @xmath54 ( moderately high state ) with @xmath55 ( intermediate screening ) .",
    "variation of the eigenvalues was monitored with respect to the radial distance @xmath51 keeping the other two parameters @xmath56 and n fixed at 25 and 200 respectively . it was seen that @xmath57 or 300 a. u. , was not suitable for either of these situations ( although these may be sufficient for weaker screenings ) and with @xmath58 a. u. , a reasonable convergence can be achieved .",
    "however , a better convergence in both these cases requires at least @xmath59 a. u. and after that , the calculated results are stable with respect to @xmath51 . as expected , for even higher states one would require a larger @xmath51 ; e. g. , the @xmath60 state with same @xmath55 requires @xmath61",
    "a. u. however , the results are apparently less sensitive with respect to @xmath62 , the total number of grid points ; only 200 points is sufficient for all the calculations reported in this work .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the finite difference ( fd ) or finite element ( fe ) methods where one usually requires a substantially larger number of radial grid points to achieve good convergence for such singular systems .",
    "this is more so , if one uses a uniform discretization scheme .",
    "the present method does not suffer from such an uncomfortable feature , for it offers equally accurate eigenfunctions both at small and the large distances with significantly smaller grid points .",
    "for a given screening parameter , within a particular @xmath11 , the required @xmath51 increases with increasing @xmath12 . for a given state , larger screening parameter requires larger @xmath51 .",
    "for example , the @xmath63 states of hulthn potential reach convergence with @xmath58 a. u. , for @xmath64 ; but @xmath65 needed @xmath66 a.u .",
    "similar considerations hold equally good for the yukawa potential .",
    ".[tab : table1]calculated negative eigenvalues e ( in a.u . ) of some selected @xmath52 states of the hulthn potential for different @xmath16 along with the literature data .",
    "an asterisk denotes the exact analytical value , eq . ( 18 ) .",
    "numbers in the parentheses denote @xmath67 values [ 18 ] .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,<,<,^ , < , < \" , ]",
    "a detailed study has been made on the accurate eigenvalues , density moments and radial densities of hulthn and yukawa potentials by employing the gps formalism .",
    "the methodology is simple , efficient , accurate and reliable .",
    "special attention has been paid to the higher excited states as well the stronger screening effects .",
    "all the 55 states belonging to @xmath68 have been computed with good accuracy and the results are compared wherever possible . in the weak coupling regions ,",
    "our results are comparable to all other accurate literature results available ( except [ 21 ] and [ 16 ] ) , while in the strong coupling region , present results are noticeably superior to all other existing results for all states of both these systems excepting the @xmath3 and @xmath4 states of yukawa potential . the @xmath69 states of yukawa potentials are significantly improved from the best available data available so far , while the same for hulthn potential are reported here for the first time . in view of the simplicity and accuracy offered by this method for both these physical systems studied in this work ,",
    "it is hoped that this may be equally successful and useful for other singular potentials in various branches of quantum mechanics .",
