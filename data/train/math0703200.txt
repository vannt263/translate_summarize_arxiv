    "the riemann map associated to a simply connected domain @xmath15 in the complex plane is the conduit for pulling back the lovely and explicit formulas on the unit disc back to the domain .",
    "thus , the green s function , poisson kernel , szeg kernel , and bergman kernel can all be expressed very simply and concretely in terms of a riemann map .",
    "the line of research in @xcite has given the ahlfors mappings associated to a multiply connected domain in the plane a similar elevated status .",
    "the classical kernel functions can all be expressed in terms of _ two _ ahlfors mappings , albeit not as concretely .",
    "an ahlfors mapping @xmath3 of a multiply connected domain is an example of a proper holomorphic mapping to the unit disc , meaning that , given a compact subset @xmath16 of the unit disc , @xmath17 must be a compact subset of the domain .",
    "when the boundary of @xmath1 consists of finitely many non - intersecting jordan curves , then @xmath3 extends continuously to the boundary , and the properness condition is equivalent to the condition that @xmath3 maps the boundary of @xmath1 into the boundary of the unit disc . in the simply connected case , all the proper holomorphic mappings to the unit disc",
    "can be written down explicitly .",
    "they are all given as finite blaschke products composed with a single riemann map .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to give a similar explicit description of all possible proper holomorphic mappings of a multiply connected domain onto the unit disc .",
    "we first give a technique for generating all the @xmath0-to - one proper holomorphic mappings of an @xmath0-connected domain onto the unit disc .",
    "these mappings can be thought of as the analogue of riemann mappings in the multiply connected setting , since they are onto and @xmath18-to - one for the smallest possible @xmath18 .",
    "afterwards , we explain how to generate _ all _ the proper holomorphic maps using the basic @xmath0-to - one maps .",
    "the set of all proper holomorphic mappings of @xmath1 to the unit disc forms a semi - group .",
    "elements can be multiplied together to get new proper maps , but division can only take place if the zero set ( counted with multiplicities ) of the denominator is a subset of the zero set of the numerator .    to motivate what follows ,",
    "we shall take a moment to describe the set of biholomorphic mappings of the unit disc onto the right half plane ( rhp ) that map a given boundary point @xmath19 to the point at infinity .",
    "the map @xmath20 , maps the unit disc biholomorphically onto the rhp and sends the point @xmath4 to @xmath21 .",
    "thus , the map @xmath22 is a biholomorphic map from the unit disc to the rhp sending the boundary point @xmath19 to @xmath21 .",
    "if @xmath23 is any other such mapping , note that the quotient @xmath24 has a removable singularity at @xmath19 .",
    "approach @xmath19 along the unit circle in a counterclockwise direction and use the fact that tangent vectors and inward pointing normals get rotated by an angle via a conformal map to see that the image under @xmath25 of the point on the circle moves along the imaginary axis and tends to @xmath26 as the point on the circle approaches @xmath19 .",
    "the same reasoning applies to @xmath23 .",
    "this shows that @xmath24 has a real and positive limit as @xmath27 tends to @xmath19 .",
    "hence , the quotient of the residues at @xmath19 is real and positive , and consequently , there is a positive constant @xmath12 such that @xmath28 has a removable singularity at @xmath19 .",
    "now @xmath28 is a holomorphic function on a neighborhood of the closed unit disc with no poles on the closed disc which is pure imaginary valued on the unit circle .",
    "such a function must be a pure imaginary constant .",
    "therefore , @xmath29 where @xmath12 is a positive constant and @xmath13 is a real constant .",
    "notice that the function @xmath30 that generates all such maps has a meromorphic extension to the disc in the @xmath19 variable .",
    "now if @xmath31 is a simply connected domain bounded by a jordan curve and @xmath3 is a riemann map from @xmath31 to the unit disc sending a boundary point @xmath32 to @xmath19 , let @xmath33 all the biholomorphic maps from @xmath31 to the right half plane sending @xmath32 to infinity are given by @xmath34 where @xmath14 and @xmath13 is real .",
    "note that these mappings extend in @xmath27 and @xmath32 as rational functions of @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "our main goal in this work will be to prove an analogous result in the multiply connected case where _ two _ ahlfors mappings shall take the place of a single riemann map .",
    "suppose @xmath1 is a bounded domain in the plane bounded by @xmath0 non - intersecting jordan curves @xmath37 , @xmath38, ",
    ",@xmath39 , and suppose @xmath3 is a proper holomorphic mapping of @xmath1 onto the unit disc .",
    "it is known that @xmath3 must extend continuously to the boundary of @xmath1 and that for each boundary curve @xmath40 , there is a positive integer @xmath41 such that the extension maps @xmath40 to the unit circle as an @xmath41-to - one covering map ( see @xcite ) .",
    "given a point @xmath42 in @xmath1 , the ahlfors mapping associated to @xmath42 is the holomorphic function @xmath43 mapping @xmath1 into the unit disc such that @xmath44 is real and maximal .",
    "ahlfors proved that the ahlfors map is a proper holomorphic mapping onto the unit disc which is an @xmath0-to - one branched covering map , which extends continuously to the boundary , and which maps each boundary curve one - to - one onto the unit circle .",
    "ahlfors maps extend meromorphically to the double of @xmath1 by virtue of the fact that @xmath45 when @xmath46 .",
    "we shall later use the result proved in @xcite that there are two points @xmath47 and @xmath48 in @xmath1 such that the ahlfors maps associated to @xmath47 and @xmath48 , when extended meromorphically to the double of @xmath1 , generate the field of meromorphic functions on the double .    given one point @xmath2 from each boundary curve @xmath40 ,",
    "bieberbach @xcite proved that there exists a proper holomorphic mapping @xmath3 which is an @xmath0-to - one branched covering map of @xmath1 onto the unit disc , and which maps each boundary curve one - to - one onto the unit circle in such a way that each point @xmath2 gets mapped to @xmath4 .",
    "we will rework a proof of this result given by h.  grunsky in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) to get more information about the structure of such maps .",
    "it will be convenient to use the right half plane as the target domain instead of the unit disc .",
    "indeed , the two settings are completely equivalent because the two targets are biholomorphic via a simple linear fractional mapping .",
    "therefore , we shall concern ourselves with constructing a proper holomorphic mapping @xmath49 of @xmath1 onto the rhp which maps each point @xmath2 to the point at infinity .",
    "the mapping @xmath49 is close to being unique .",
    "grunsky demonstrates that @xmath49 is uniquely determined up to multiplication by a positive constant and addition of an imaginary constant .",
    "let @xmath50 denote the vector of boundary points and let @xmath51 denote the mapping to the rhp described above .",
    "we shall call any such mapping a _ grunsky map _ , since we shall modify grunsky s construction to prove our main results .",
    "our main theorem yields a rational function which generates all such maps .",
    "[ thm1 ] if @xmath1 is an @xmath0-connected domain in the plane bounded by @xmath0 non - intersecting jordan curves , there exist two points @xmath47 and @xmath48 in @xmath1 such that the ahlfors maps @xmath6 and @xmath7 associated to @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively , generate the grunsky maps in the sense that there is a rational function of @xmath5 variables such that any grunsky map @xmath51 is given by @xmath52 where @xmath14 and @xmath13 is real .",
    "we emphasize that the rational function in the statement of the theorem is fixed . only the constants @xmath12 and @xmath13 vary .",
    "by composing the grunsky maps in the theorem with the linear fractional transformation @xmath53 , a formula is obtained for all the proper holomorphic @xmath0-to - one mappings of the domain @xmath1 onto the unit disc .",

    "we shall always denote the boundary curves of @xmath31 by @xmath40 , @xmath60 , and we follow the convention of letting @xmath39 denote the outermost boundary curve ( the curve bounding the unbounded component of the complement of @xmath31 ) .",

    "the function @xmath49 is unique up to a positive multiplicative and an imaginary additive constant .",
    "we may assume that the boundary curves of @xmath1 are real analytic since domains of the kind mentioned in the theorem are biholomorphic to domains with real analytic boundary via a biholomorphic mapping which extends continuously to the boundary .",

    "if @xmath71 , the hopf lemma implies that @xmath102 for @xmath101 , @xmath71 .",

    "the only parameters in the construction that we can vary are the real positive constant @xmath119 and the choice of an imaginary constant in the construction of the harmonic conjugate @xmath113 .",
    "this completes the overview of grunsky s proof .",
    "in this section , we will start by deriving an important relationship between the periods @xmath103 of the previous section and the classical functions @xmath120 which are defined via @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the harmonic measure function which is harmonic in @xmath31 , has boundary values one on @xmath40 and zero on the other boundary curves .",
    "for a point @xmath27 in the boundary of @xmath31 , let @xmath123 denote the complex number of unit modulus pointing in the tangential direction given by the standard sense of the boundary .",
    "we shall show that @xmath124 ( like every complex analyst , we view the symbol @xmath125 to represent a positive integer as a subscript and the famous complex number elsewhere . )    it is an elementary fact that if @xmath62 is a real valued harmonic function that is smooth up to the boundary and constant on the boundary , then @xmath126 where @xmath127 denotes arc length .",
    "if we divide this identity by @xmath127 , we obtain @xmath128 thus , for example , @xmath129 and it follows that @xmath130    notice that @xmath131 and since @xmath54 is harmonic in @xmath58 and zero on the boundary for for fixed @xmath27 , it follows that @xmath132 we next differentiate this identity with respect to @xmath27 and multiply by @xmath133 to obtain the well known identity @xmath134    since each @xmath135 is real valued harmonic and zero on boundary curves @xmath86 with @xmath82 , we have that if @xmath71 , then @xmath136    recall that @xmath137 .",
    "hence @xmath138 where @xmath27 denotes the second variable .",
    "so , for @xmath82 , ( [ eqn3.8 ] ) gives @xmath139 the green s function is symmetric , i.e. , @xmath140 for @xmath141 with @xmath142 , and so @xmath143 we may compare this to equation  ( [ eqn3.a ] ) to obtain @xmath144    for the case @xmath89 , since @xmath145 we obtain @xmath146 but @xmath147 , and so @xmath148 .",
    "hence , the last equation reduces to @xmath149 which agrees with our general formula , and the identity is proved .",
    "we next wish to show that the coefficients @xmath79 in the definition of @xmath49 have extension properties in the variables @xmath2 .",

    "the hopf lemma reveals that the functions @xmath120 do not vanish on the boundary ( since they are non - zero multiples of the normal derivatives of the harmonic measure functions @xmath122 there ) .",
    "furthermore , the identity  ( [ eqn3f ] ) allows us to note that @xmath153 is equal to the conjugate of @xmath153 on the boundary .",
    "hence , it follows that @xmath153 extends meromorphically to the double of @xmath1 .",
    "it was proved in @xcite that there exist two points in @xmath1 such that the meromorphic extensions of the ahlfors maps @xmath6 and @xmath7 associated to the two points to the double of @xmath1 generate the field of meromorphic functions on the double .",
    "thus @xmath153 is a rational combination of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "consider the system  ( [ eqn2.1 ] ) of @xmath108 equations in @xmath108 unknowns .",
    "we have already noted that this system has a unique solution",

    "the functions @xmath182 extend to the double in @xmath27 and each @xmath2 , and the ahlfors map @xmath3 extends to the double too .",
    "we shall factor all those terms involving functions which extend to the double in @xmath27 or any @xmath2 out in front of each term in the large sum and concentrate on what remains , which are constants times terms of the form @xmath247 the second expression extends meromorphically to the double in the variable @xmath2 because it is a quotient of functions of @xmath2 satisfying condition  ( [ eqncond ] ) .",
    "we may simplify the first expression by noting that quotients of the form @xmath248 extend meromorphically to the double in @xmath27 since they are equal to the conjugate of @xmath249 on the boundary .",

    "we may finally conclude that @xmath49 is a rational combination of functions of @xmath27 which extend meromorphically to the double and functions of @xmath2 which extend meromorphically to the double .",
    "since , as mentioned before , meromorphic functions on the double are generated by two ahlfors maps , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the proof of theorem  [ thm1 ] is complete in case @xmath1 has real analytic boundary curves . if @xmath1 is bounded by @xmath0 non - intersecting jordan curves , it is a standard device to map @xmath1 biholomorphically to a domain with real analytic boundary ( see grunsky @xcite ) .",

    "it is clear that @xmath292 boundary points @xmath293 , @xmath294 can be added on @xmath39 under the same procedure to obtain a proper holomorphic map that maps @xmath39 to the boundary of the rhp in an @xmath292-to - one manner and all the other boundary curves in a one - to - one manner .",
    "there was nothing special about choosing the boundary curve @xmath39 above .",
    "extra points can be added to any boundary curve in the same way .",
    "we shall now explain how to generate _ all _ the proper holomorphic mappings to the rhp .",
    "all the proper holomorphic mappings of @xmath1 to the rhp are given by linear combinations of grunsky maps @xmath295 subject to the conditions that all the @xmath296 are real and that when the real part of the map is decomposed into a sum of the form @xmath297 where the @xmath2 are distinct boundary points , there must be at least one @xmath2 on each boundary curve , and each coefficient @xmath79 must be strictly positive .",
    "we remark that the positivity condition in the theorem is just a sequence of linear inequalities on the coefficients @xmath296 . taking each @xmath296 to be positive always leads to a proper map .",
    "we shall see during the proof , however , that it is possible to construct proper maps where some of the @xmath296 might be negative .    to prove the theorem , we use induction on the number of boundary points in @xmath262 where @xmath49 is a proper holomorphic mapping of @xmath1 onto the rhp .",
    "we handled the case of @xmath298 and @xmath280 boundary points above ( where @xmath0 is the connectivity of @xmath1 ) .",
    "assume the theorem is true in the case of @xmath292 boundary points and suppose @xmath49 is a proper holomorphic map to the rhp of mapping degree @xmath299 .",
    "we know that @xmath265 must contain at least one boundary point from each boundary curve .",
    "choose points @xmath300 from @xmath265 in @xmath301 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath3 denote the grunsky map associated to this sequence of boundary points .",
    "since @xmath302 , there is at least one boundary curve , say @xmath263 , that contains more than one point .",
    "let @xmath303 and let @xmath304 be a proper holomorphic mapping ( as constructed above ) such that @xmath305 .",
    "we now claim that it is possible to choose positive constants @xmath12 and @xmath306 so that @xmath307 is a proper holomorphic mapping to the rhp of mapping degree  @xmath292 .",
    "we may decompose the real part of @xmath308 as @xmath309 where all the coefficients @xmath79 , @xmath310 , @xmath311 , and @xmath312 are positive . by choosing @xmath306 sufficiently large ( and positive )",
    ", we may choose a @xmath14 so that the similar decomposition for @xmath307 has a zero coefficient in front of the term @xmath313 and positive coefficients in front of the other @xmath292 poisson kernel terms . since the pole at @xmath183 is removed , the resulting map is a proper holomorphic map with mapping degree @xmath292 .",
    "our induction hypothesis yields that @xmath307 is a linear combination of grunsky maps .",
    "our construction of @xmath304 is also a linear combination of grunsky maps .",
    "it follows that @xmath49 is a linear combination of grunsky maps .",
    "the positivity condition in the theorem is a necessary feature of any proper holomorphic map to the rhp .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "it is particularly easy to find `` primitive pairs '' among the grunsky maps .",
    "indeed , the grunsky maps extend meromorphically to the double by simple reflection .",
    "they extend to be @xmath0-to - one mappings of the double to the extended complex plane . given a grunsky map @xmath314 ,",
    "choose points @xmath2 , one in each boundary curve , so that @xmath315 consists of @xmath0 distinct points in the finite complex plane .",
    "( this is easy to do since @xmath314 maps each boundary curve one - to - one onto the imaginary axis union the point at infinity . )",
    "now let @xmath316 be the grunsky map that maps each @xmath2 to the point at infinity .",
    "since @xmath314 separates the points of @xmath317 , it follows that the extensions of @xmath314 and @xmath316 to the double generate all the meromorphic functions on the double , i.e. , they form a primitive pair ( see farkas and kra @xcite ) .",
    "the process of constructing grunsky maps can be carried out on a finite riemann surface and the argument above can be used to construct pairs @xmath314 and @xmath316 of grunsky maps that extend to the double to form primitive pairs for the double . when this line of reasoning is combined with results in @xcite",
    ", it follows that the @xmath318-form that is the bergman kernel on a finite riemann surface can be expressed via @xmath319 where @xmath9 is a rational function of four complex variables .",
    "finally , we remark that although we expressed the grunsky maps in terms of two ahlfors maps , we could just as easily have expressed them in terms of rational combinations of _ any _ two meromorphic functions on @xmath1 that extend to the double to form a primitive pair for the double .",
    "when @xmath1 happens to be a quadrature domain , the function @xmath27 and the schwarz function @xmath320 ( which is an algebraic function that is meromorphic on @xmath1 ) are a particularly appealing choice ( see gustafsson @xcite ) .",
    "since any smooth finitely connected domain is biholomorphic to a quadrature domain that is @xmath193 close by ( see @xcite ) , we conclude that it is possible to make subtle holomorphic changes of variables so that the grunsky maps can be expressed in terms of rational functions of @xmath27 and the schwarz function .",
    "this is very analogous to the prime example of a quadrature domain , the unit disc , where the schwarz function is @xmath321 and the grunsky maps are simple linear fractional transformations in @xmath27 and @xmath19 as shown in the introduction ."
